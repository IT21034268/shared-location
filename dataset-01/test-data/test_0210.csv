1,Bad Choice,I have owned this Vacuum for one year. DO NOT BUY ONE!! I have had in therepair shop 4 times.This was my worst purchase.
5,Cannister vs. Uoright,If you have more than one floor cannister is the way to go. This product meets all my needs while being in my price range.
5,hoover windtunnel electronic bagless vacuum cleaner,"This is my second vacuum of this type. I have had my first for 1 1/2 years and it is still going strong. It takes a little care but it is well worth it. If you empty it and clean the filter with water after each use, the vacuum is awesome. I have had Sears, electrolux and other great brand and none have been as good as this. My husband had purchased the same vacuum except it was not the electronic one. Mine is better because it has better attachments. I must tell you, though, I do not have carpeting in my house, so I am not going to say how it is for that, but I LOVE THIS VACUUM!!!!!!"
2,not good for older/weaker person,"this vacuum picks up well, but the beater bar pulls really hard. i purchased for my mother, and wish i could return it because it is a bit hard for her to control."
4,Hoover S3765 Review,"So far I am quite happy with my new purchase. It does have great suction power, but being that I have a dog that sheds, I usually dump the dirt cup out every time I vaccuum which is no big deal to me. It's light and compact and overall great so far."
1,Not a winner,"Ordered - used a few times and returned.The belt that drives the brushes kept slipping off.Called Hoover, they referred me to service center hundreds of miles away.They said belts usually have to be replaced 2-3 times a year as they expand with use. They determined from the serial # of the machine that it was manufactured 11/07 - bought 8/08 - belt may have deteriorated just sitting there.The belt drive is not well designed - no ridge or collar to keep it on drive shaft.Looking for something more reliable.Amazon return experience very good (haven't seen refund yet) and easy to ship if you have a big enough box"
4,Buyer beware!,"I love this vacuum cleaner. I have two Huskies that shed continiously and this vacuum cleaner makes short work of all the hair. No smell left lingering because of the hepa filter and best of all NO BAG to replace. Be careful of the cord connected on the power head. Mine shorted out and burned the carpet. 1 week later, the on/off button on the handle quit working. I'm glad these things decided to go out before the 1 year warranty was up, otherwise I would be out $140.00. After warranty, a different machine."
1,Not So Good :-(,"I purchased this vacumn 9/2005. Initally, I absolutely loved it! As time went on I discovered I actually hated it! 1)does not get close enough to walls, etc., for 'edge cleaning'. 2) the filter is an absolute nightmare! It requires constant cleaning if it is to have the suction required to vacumn. The only way to get the damn thing really truly clean is to take it outside and bang it gently for 15 20 minutes on a hard surface and then high pressure hose the filter out which then means 4 to 5 days of drying time! What a pain in the neck! 3) within the first year there seemed to be an issue with a short of some kind in the handle where you activate the amount of suction (on/off) and turn the power head on/off. Perhaps that is an easy fix for the repair guy, I dunno, I'm replacing it with a dyson animal d17. With 5000 sq feet of house to clean I can't be bothered with taking my vacumn to a repair service. I would NOT recommend this vacumn to anyone. Not impressed with hoover at all."
3,Hoover S3765-040 Vacuum Cleaner Review,"The ordering and delivery processes were excellent. The vacuum cleaner works well. There are a few problems with the vacuum cleaner. First, it does not provide all the brushes it should. There is no dusting or upholstery brush. Second, the suction control is very easy to hit accidently and it is difficult to see the suction level indicator. Third, it requires a lot of man handling when cleaning a rug with the power brush."
5,The good and the bad,"Hoover Wind Tunnel S3765I've just finished using it for the 3rd time, so my opinion is not based on the `fresh-out-of-the-box glow.Positive observations:m The main attachment's revolving brush is electronically powered, which makes it superior to those that are suction-powered. Though, it also comes with a smaller suction-powered tool. (I understand, however, that not all models include this suction-powered tool.)m Has 3 different power settings, which is useful for various surfaces.m Design is quite simple and logical.Negative observations:m The hose connexion does not revolve, which inevitably necessitates the occasional pause to untwist.m The crevice tool is made of a black plastic that rubs off on walls and other surfaces. Great for those who happen to have black walls. For the other 99.9% of us, not so great."
1,Terrible Vacuum!,"When we first got this vacuum I was so excited to use it. It's very cute! Parts of it do look cheap, but it's very modern and sleek looking for the most part. At first it cleaned great, but withing a few months we were replacing the roller. After that it all went downhill. We have had it 9 months it was not cleaning half as good as my moms 10 year old kenmore, and we are assumming some of the electrical wiring when out in the the hose. It's shot. We are trying to see what the company will do. I am not interested in this again. I would like to just give the extra money once and for all and buy a nice vacumm!"
1,fan belt isue,"I read all the reviews for this vacuum hoping for something great. However, within 20 minutes, the fan belt came off twice. Also, it is very difficult to remove the plastic lid to replace the belt. Buy another vacuum, guys."
2,No stamina,Vacuum is great at first but does not last a year without something breaking. Hose splits - taped now - and handle comes apart. Not impressive design. You pay for the light weight with a lack of reliability. Nice price tho - I paid a lot more at Costco but can return it forever ;}
1,Broken and in shop for months,"I'm sad to say that I am NOT satisfied with this purchase. The vacuum worked for approximately three weeks and then had an electrical short in the power control after very minimal use. I called Hoover and they had me take it to an authorized Hoover repair center. It has been there for two months already and I am still waiting to get it back. The repair center claims they are still waiting for Hoover to send the repair parts.I did like the lightweight operation of the vacuum. I did NOT like how small the dirt canister was.In hindsight, I really wish that I had paid the money to purchase a second Dyson. We've had a Dyson for 5+ years and it sucks up dirt and animal hair like it's nobody's business. I wanted a second machine for the lower level of our house and thought I'd try a less expensive unit. In my opinion, I got what I paid for: a piece of junk. Very disappointed."
4,Hoover s3765-040 Wind Tunnel,"Have had the cleaner for a month now and it does what it should, quite well.The size of the cleaning head is a bit larger and heavier than I need/would like.It's a little too loud also.We mostly have hardwood floors and although the vacuum cleans them well, it's really kind of difficult to tell if it's working or not.All in all I would have looked for a lighter vacuum, but am happy with this purchase."
5,Love this vac!,"I searched for an affordable vac made in the USA. Bought his one based upon other comments I read, and it is awesome! Powerful, easy to use, lightweight...everything I wanted. Cord is held within the unit & returns easily. May not last forever based upon the price, but well worth the investment."
4,Hoover Bagless Canister Works Great on Tile Floors,"We just traded in our Sear canister of many years for a Hoover Wind Tunnel Bagless Canister. It is compact, lighter weight than our old one, and works great on our Saltillo tile floors. The dust cup is easy to clean, which is good because we have five animals in the house. I really like the extra wide, lightweight special hard floor attachment.Only bad thing is that the upholstery brush that came with the machine is dinky. I saved and use my old one from the Sears vacuum. It fits on the hose just fine. Also, I cannot really speak about the basic rug vacuum attachment, since I have not used it. Dont have any rugs now. (Simplify, simplify).Overall, we think this machine is great!"
4,Great Vacuum Cleaner!!,"I wasn't sure about this vacuum when I got it out of the box until I tried it. It has plenty of suction and does a great job on both hard floors and carpetted floors. I decided to do an experiment with my Dyson and this one. I vacuumed a section of the floor with the Dyson then went over it with the canister. I was surprised to see the amount of dirt the Dyson left behind. I reversed the experiment by using the canister first and then the Dyson. The canister picked up a lot of dirt and the Dyson had virtually nothing.The only things I don't like are the short electical cord and the capacity of the dirt cup. I have to empty it every time I vacuum and wash it out every other week. Overall, for the performance it is worth the extra work though."
5,Very satisfied,"I have purchased both very good and very bad vacuums in the past. This one is probably the best. VERY good suction, easy to empty the canister, and the power stair/upholstery tool works quite well. The variable speed suction is handy too. The only thing I would change is the size of the canister - it holds a bit less than other vacuums I've owned. However, it's only a very minor inconvenience, since it takes seconds to empty. I realize there are some high end vacuums out there that probably work better, but I couldn't justify paying $500 - 1000 for a vacuum."
2,Not a year old and stopped Sucking,I got this vacuum in january of 2008. I chose this vacuum because of the great reviews. I purchased an extra fiter so i can wash one and keep one in the machine. It was great when I first got it but now it does not suck. I have to switch out the fiter everytime I use it. So I would recomend buying something with a bag if you want it to last. I am on here once again looking for a new vacuum. I was hoping this one would last because I loved it it pulls great. the power head is awsome and the bear floor attachment is big and works well. It just did not last.
4,Seems like a Good Choice,"Good Vacuum for the price. Sucks real good. Adjustable suction lets you control how much or how little. Bagless is convenient but a little dirty- i empty outside. What?? no beater bar height adjustment?? Seems to be set real low- cleans rugs well, but seems to beat the heck out or rugs. Works great for me on both hardwoods and carpets. Ability to turn off beater with thumb controls is great!! Seems pretty durable."
1,DON'T buy this vacuum,"There's a reason why they sell this product with the ad:""Better Together. Buy this item with Hoover Agitator Belt today!""I purchased this vacuum in late 2007 after reading most of the Amazon product reviews. None of the reviews mentioned that the belt comes off OFTEN. I have taken it in for service twice. I was told that the belt comes off when using it to vacuum wool rugs and animal fur. I was also advised to use the ""low"" suction when doing so.Certainly not pet-owner-friendly. Get yourself a Dyson."
2,Great Suction - Breaks Easily!,This would be a great vacumn if the controls didn't quit working. The only source to turn on/off the power is in the handle. The wiring has to travel through the hose to reach the canister and it shorts out often. Bummer.
4,Va-va-va-voom!,"I was so excited when my research revealed *this* would be the perfect vacuum for our new house, which has hardwood floors throughout and only half a floor of carpet in the basement. The reviews were great and the price, at the time, was unbeatable, so I ordered in a hurry.I put the vacuum together and plugged it in, and wouldn't you know it? The brush on the carpet/floor attachment wouldn't rotate. I called Amazon, sent it back at their expense and had a new one in two days. That's what I call customer service.The new one works like a charm and, from the little bit of experimenting I've done so far, seems like a great product. I haven't had to clean the filter or the bagless container yet, but it doesn't seem like rinsing them under cold water--the recommended cleaning mode--will be too strenuous.The vacuum is super high powered on low-nap carpet, so hold on to that wand! On hardwood floors, it picks up everything.Enjoy!"
4,Super suction,"This cannister vacuum gets pet hair (3 cats) and it isn't even called a pet hair vacuum. Does a good job on bare floors and an excellent job on carpets, even shag. I would like it to be a little lighter and a little more manuverable, but it's well worth the price. Love the retractable cord."
2,Not as informative as hoped,"Not as informative as hoped, talks alot about moleculer structures and such although very little preventive maintenance topics. Shop around!!"
4,A Very Helpful Reference....,For marine aquarium Reef Keepers this is a very useful reference to identify and control nuisance algae blooms!
4,fabulous colors,"This is a great learning book for young ones - colors, shapes and most of all adjectives! It helps fuel a lot of good questions about comparing and contrasting."
5,Amazing!!,This yoga mat is amazing. It's extra long and just a little nit wider so you have all the room you need. It's thickness makes it so much better only wrists and knees. I definitely recommend this mat. Well worth the money!!
5,Buy it,"Buy it! You won't be sorry, just out a few bucks. Best mat I have ever used. Get the carrying bag also. It has extra comparments for other cloths, car keys, money etc. You will also look cool & isn't that what it's all about.:)It's not that heavy. Besides carrying it will make you stronger."
3,Manduka Black Mat PRO 85-Inch Yoga and Pitates Mat,"I purchased the Manduka Black Mat Pro 85-Inch Yoga & Pilates Mat on January 8, 2013 - I was so excited to get the mat....it took about two days to received it by UPS. I knew It was going to be some what slippery the first time I used the mat...but iT seems that after a month later the mat is still slippery I am trying to give it some time to brake in but it is very hard when you are doing a class and you keep sliding...it makes it very hard to hold to psition"
4,Broad scope,This book covers all sorts of meditation from many different countries to many different religions. It shows the reader step by step how to meditate as well as answering many frequently asked questions (FAQ). This book also covers the history behind many culture's reason for meditation and the roots behind various meditations. This is a very complete book in that the reader can pick from whatever style of meditation they want and then they have a step by step description of how to go about it.
2,"Great idea, very poor implementation","I've been a user of the Nike PSA radio before this model, which was great for running, but the reception was always very poor, so when they came out with the PSA 110, I gave it another try, and my second one just died after about three weeks of use (maybe 10 hours total).While I believe it should be at least sweat resistant, it seems that the battery cover does not make a proper seal, and after about 30 minutes of running, even on a new battery, the LCD display fogs up, then the device goes erratic, and eventually dies completely. It's happened on two of them in the past three months, and I've decided to try something else.It's a great design, fits perfectly on the arm, but if you want to listen to the radio, that's another story entirely."
4,Strange successor to PSA100,"I purchased the PSA110 as a successor to the PSA100 that I had used for years. Aside from being slightly larger than its predecessor, the performance is similar, but I'm confused by two odd design decisions. One, you can no longer change the battery while the radio is in the armband (an annoyance in the middle of a run) and two, when you mount the radio in the armband it's horizontal rather than vertical."
5,Outstanding!!!,"Finaly an excelent book on the subject. Easy to read yet covers the subject of Feng Shui with knowlege. The book is divided into small chapters making it estremely functional. It is one of those books that we can use as a manual or a guide. After reading the book entirely, I keep returning to certain chapters to learn more about certain aspects of Feng Shui. The more I read, the more I want to read it. It is all explained so well.It is definitely a useful tool to help improve all aspects of our lives. I am waiting for the second book. The author truly capters the readers attention."
4,True to Life,"Aside from Michael Keaton delivering yet another outstanding performance, along with a fine appearance by Morgan Freeman, this classic movie about addiction, treatment, recovery and the reality of all the ensuing complications is one of the few that gets it right. This is not just a depressing story about some drunk stumbling around for two hours and then finally dying. This is an honest and entertaining look at close to what it is really like to go through what the movie's characters endure. Similar to the reality of A Man and A Woman, another of the rare group of movies that entertain while educating about addiction without preaching. There is one scene in here that you do NOT want anyone to tell you about ahead of time. It is guaranteed to grab you! I highly recommend it, whether you are exposed to addiction's issues or not. It is good viewing."
4,Eye Opener!,"If you are reading this review that means you have an interest in this subject, if you are interested in the subject then BUY this book! This was the first book to ever get my mind ""wondering"" about how vast our universe is. From Astral Twins to planets that align to cause earthquakes to the death of Presidents, this book connects many dots that have since been forgotten and any serious mind should study. The book is out of print and hard to find. I thought myself very, very lucky to find it here Amazon.Should be rewritten and updated with the last 40 years of information that has been collected on various data. Otherwise it is an excellent book."
2,unspeakable practices,"I read ""the school"" in an anthology, and liked it. But I guess I'm too straight, as these stories are a bit off the wall to me..."
5,fascinating book!,"This book is not only about gravestone rubbings, but also the early stonecarvers who had the skills to decorate these gravestones. I have repeatedly taken it out of my art school's library because I am fascinated with the different carvings on the gravestones. These rubbings of the carvings include faces of angels, portraits of the deceased, urns, willow trees, and other decorative motifs. It may seem morbid to enjoy such a book, yet I find it completely fascinating book!"
5,serendipity,"I bought this DVD based on multiple recommendations I've seen on the web and from friends with shared interests. Initially, I mostly went for the Callum Keith Rennie factor, and he was terrific in this movie, no questions about it. For CKR fans, this is one of the most enjoyable roles he's played where his talents are not abused by scripts looking for a brilliant and intense villain.On top of that, I was most pleasantly surprised by how well the ensemble of great actors came together -- everyone else on the film carried their own weight and made the gestalt so much more than I ever could've expected. This is a refreshing treat for those tired of the graphic violence, gloom, or cheesy inanity plaguing the postmodern cinema."
4,Great bibs for a major drooling baby,"Although these bibs are plain and are not cute as the ones with funny quotes, it really does the job. The reason why I gave it four stars is because although the bib have plastic in between the terry cloths; when there's excessive drool, it'll soak the entire front and eventually seep around to the trimming by the neck and wet the back as well.I still love these bibs because it work a lot better than the expensive ones like Carter's which holds up drool well but is too hard. These are soft and when you wear them on the baby and it can face either way.I just bought another set so I wouldn't have to wash them so frequently. 10 will last me a week. They can be thrown in the dryer with the rest of babies clothes. I will recommend these to others and will be buying for friends' baby showers."
5,Best bibs we've ever had,"does everything it says and the solid colors are great for matching every outfit. Although it says not to tumble dry, I throw them in the dryer anyway. They withstand washing and drying very well. My son is the king of all droolers and we have to change his bibs at least 5x a day, but because of the waterproof feature of these bibs, we never need to change his clothes."
1,Not enough cotton,Only 75% cotton surface (25% polyester) with polyurethane inner liner. Seems 100% cotton terry bibs are hard to come by.
2,Scratches baby's neck.,I like the bib but the Velcro is very had/tough and leaves scratches all over the back of 4 month old baby's neck. Would give four+ stars if they were buttons or softer Velcro.
5,Great bibs!,"Read many reviews before purchasing these... and in spite of many comments about non-waterproof items shipping, decided to take the chance. The bibs that shipped to me did, in fact, include the waterproof liner. The colors are wonderful. Quality is wonderful. They launder beautifully and come out of the dryer looking just as fresh as new. I expected them to shrink and become a bit limp and shapeless, but was pleasantly surprised. The waterproof liner is sandwiched between 2 soft cotton knit layers with well-finished soft edges... nothing rough to irritate little ones. I would definitely recommend these to anyone searching for lightweight, inexpensive, waterproof bibs.My only negative? The company may be doing themselves a disservice by labeling these for boys! The colors are just as perfect for little girls - mine were purchased for my granddaughter."
2,Nice bib BUT the sizing is incorrect,"I bought these bibs for my grandson because the price seemed fair & I liked the idea of the plastic ""sandwiched"" in between the 2 cloth's. The quality is nice but the sizing is incorrect. My grandson is only 5 months old,(average in size) & the bibs are supposed to be for the ages of 6 to 12 months but he is outgrowing the bibs already! Doesn't seem fair that ""Green Sprouts"" isn't advertising everything correctly. So be leery of ordering these bibs because they are for a size NB to 4 months of age."
2,A Storm in Flanders,"This is a solid attempt for a novelist and non historian, and Groom is certainly a good novelist. But, if you had to have your speeen removed, would you go to a good dentist?"
1,November,"We, my husband and I, didn't like it at all. It played to much with the mind. I didn't like the language right from the start. The robbery was the most I watched. My husband watched it for a little longer and finally turned it off and said I could get rid of it because he didn't like the games that were being played with the mind."
1,Pass on this mess,"So, I went for the sucker quotes on the box, the ""Two Thumbs Up"", the ""Cannes Film Festival Winner"", etc. - this movie proves that sort of labeling you can't even trust anymore. The movie is basically a poor man's ""Memento"", of sorts - one of those films that messes with you in that you can't tell what's reality and what's not. No wonder the video store only had one slot on the shelf for this waste of time. And I wonder what exactly they're smoking at Cannes?"
2,Tiresome,"Evidently, people getting shot is one of the only topics for American movies. No wonder the Euros see us as uncivilized. In this one, Courtney Cox's boyfriend buys the farm in a convenience store. We see it over and over and over. It's part of some muddled plot about how she grieves. Was she really there? It's a psychological thing. At least, this only runs 68 minutes. Barely worth the time investment."
1,Disappointing,Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and it was totally scratched up!She was very disappointed because she love Bella dancerella items.
2,Guess you get what you pay for,"I guess I should have read what's included a little closer. Yes, 205 pieces. 30 of those are small plastic cable ties. Item was also shipped with an important piece missing, the adapter for the ratchet to allow use of the smaller sockets. Called the seller and was promised a call back that never came. Fortunately had a similar piece from an older tool set I had otherwise this would have been even more worthless."
3,"good product, quick shipping","good product, lots of useful items, but there was one of the smaller screwdrivers that was broken on delivery, the handle and the screwdriver head were not attached.other than the one piece, the rest of the set has been fine thus far and will be a good gift."
1,Bad Movie,"This has to be one of the worst movies ever made, Despite the cast wich I expected more from. This was a really bad movie. The plot seemed like a good idea but the story never came together."
4,Suicide Kings,This is a movie about a group of college friends who kidnapp a supposed retired gangster (Christopher Walken) thinking that it will help one of them get there kidnapped sister back..These kids really don't know who they are messing with..There plan start to go awry when they start to talk about killing him and when his body guard Lono (Dennis Leary) comes into the picture..This is an excellent movie and nothin is what it seems!!
1,"Good Movie, Lousy DVD","I've heard the good and the bad about this movie and mostly agree with it all. I come out slightly in favor of liking this film mostly because of the performaces of Walken and Leary. The ""Special Edition"" DVD, however, was a purchase I could have done without. I was most interested in seeing the imfamous ""alternate endings"". Well, I got to SEE the endings, but thanks to Peter O'Fallon commenting over the dialogue of all of the characters, I didn't get to HEAR the alternate endings. The only time he shut his mouth was when the characters were NOT speaking any dialogue! I wish I had O'Fallons email address because I'd really like a refund on this DVD!"
4,gift for a friend,"Great performances by Christopher Walken and Denis Leary. Lots of plot twists, very dark humor. The while movie you are trying to piece together what's going on and the kidnappers play of each other very well. If you are looking for Disney storytelling this one isn't for you. If you can take something a little darker though, this movie will not disappoint."
4,woo,"This movie is one of my favorites; Christopher Walken's brooding Christopher Walken...ness, Denis Leary's comic relief so to speak, the superb acting from Jay Mohr, Jeremy Sisto, Sean Flannery, and blah blah blah...basically I think this is an excellent story conveyed with impressive acting, and I'm suprised at how this movie gets no real recognition. In any case, good stuff. I wonder if this is where Mohr picked up his Walken impersonation... or was it SNL? ah, who cares."
4,Suicide Kings Review,"In this dark comedy, Christopher Walken shines as a mobster abducted by five friends (including Jay Mohr and Henry Thomas). These guys believe Walken can solve the kidnapping of one of their sisters. As Walken plays mind games, his captors splinter, each wondering whether one of them had a hand in the crime. The DVD is chock-full of fascinating extras."
5,Interesting idea and story like,"I enjoy Christopher Walken, the idea of the film has many twists and turns. Christopher Walken is at his best in roles that show his power with the one look and the tone of his voice. Interesting film."
4,Babes in Trouble,"Have to admit one of the most redeeming qualities of this dark little film is the cast is made up of some damn fine looking guys! Me and some girlfriends have a really good treat marveling at how these guys are such dimwits while they're making us drool. Misogyny in reverse you could say. Someone kidnaps Avery's kid sister Alice and he and his friends come up with a stupid, stupid, can we say STU-PID? scheme to get her back unharmed. Then they find out she has lost her finger. These dumb honeys kidnap Chris Walken of all people and tie him to a chair. Are they suicidal or just plain stupid? Hence the title. These delectable young psycos are so dumb that Walken spends the movie twisting stuff around until he has them all dizzy and mixed up and fooled! Great eye candy, great story, and Dennis Leary rocks. As for TK and Max, come here you fine young things, come to Aunty Sharon. Oh yeah you can sit on my lap I wont mind!"
2,Meh?,"""And the best part is, no one gets hurt."" 0.o Or not...?I *guess* this is an okay movie, but really? it had the emotions of a reptile. I only continued to watch it because my boyfriend said it was a good movie."
4,great music not great mixes,"he did great picking the songs for the album but they are not mixed as they should. some of them just finish and then the other song starts! i mean, if you like a cd to take you into the feeling of the music you dont want to notice when the songs are being changed and just enjoy listening to the whole cd. i did 4stars for this reason instead of 5. good cd. i have all hotel costes collection. if you like good lounge, electro jazz, not commercial thing, then it's a good catch"
1,"Wow, this movie sucked",How did we get defeated so easily and how did they nuke our capital? That would mean that they would come from the east. Only true thing about this movie was that the soviet union was going to nuke us when stalin was alive. But then stalin died so the plan failed. I completely agree with anyone else who hates this unrealistic film.
4,enjoyable mind candy,"... It is just another action film and what if scenario. The acting is wooden, and most of the time, the dialogue is a joke, and there are huge plot holes. But if you just sit back and take the movie for what it is, mind candy, and not as propoganda or a serious attempt at art, then you'll probably find this movie to be entertaining.As a dvd it doesn't offer much. The trailer, widescreen, and the film. I did have one problem with the subtitles. I found that during the Spanish and Russian dialogue scenes, I had to turn on the subtitles because otherwise those scenes weren't subtitled. Then when English speaking scenes appeared again, I had to turn the subtitles off."
3,Post Apocalyptic Midwest,"Imagine a world where Russian and Cuba could land invade the US... Add a star studded cast (Swayze, Sheen, etc) and you realize that this story is so bad that they can't make it really believable. Ironically it did get 3 stars for being a post-soviet US classic.."
3,Great movie!,This is one of the great movies of the mid 80's! You can't go wrong with a great story and an all star cast. And for all of you movie trivia buffs....this was the very first movie to be released in theaters with a PG-13 rating!
4,Could Jim Emerson be more of a tool?,"I read Jim boy's little review; any doubt he's a complete and utter moron?Where does Amazon find these idiots to do their ""editorials?"" My 8 year old nephew could do a better job than Jimmy.Perhaps she should stick to reviews of cartoon, maybe the Smurfs because she'd probably label transformers, nazis from space or some other idiotic analogy?Too bad we couldn't pull a Michael J Fox and roll back in time and stop Jimmy's parents from having her."
4,Good,"It's a retake on an old movie I viewed some years back.....Silly question, why do I have to meet a minimum amount of words for a review??? Not if you want more responses."
4,Good deal on a blu-ray movie,The blu-ray was cheaper than the DVD and this is a classic. Definitely worth the price and the packaging was great.
3,What If?,"What if Communist Russians invade the United States? Teens from America's heartland take on the Reds as guerrilla fighters in this fairytale action-war movie. This seems like a plot that somebody made up for a High School short story. Not a bad cast, which includes Patrick Swayze, Lea Thompson, Ben Johnson, Charlie Sheen, Powers Boothe and Harry Dean Stanton, make the film interesting but John Milius' direction is very pedestrian."
5,A good movie but immpossible plot.,Red Dawn is one of my all time favourite movies but it is quite obviously written by a paranoid anti-communist. The massacres and genocide undertaken by the cuban and the soviets would have been extremely rare had the soviets and their allies truly invaded the united states. I believe that this movie could qualify as a classic case of cold war propaganda from the the USA.
1,I HATED THIS MOVIE,"THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE SEEN. THE ACTING IS THE WORST PART AND SOME OF THE PARTS OF THE MOVIE ARE JUST DUMB. WE BOUGHT IT FOR UNDER $10.00, SO, IF YOU WANT THIS MOVIE, GET IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. MY SIXTH GRADE PLAY WAS BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE!!!!! DoN't BuY tHiS mOvIe."
5,Blood and Guts from an old Enemy,"When this first came out, of course it got maybe a half a star, but, of course, I used to live in a BLUE city along the southern Calif. coast line! Since I love this kind of movie anyway-6******'s! It does show war, pain, suffering and death as it should to probably prevent future ACTUAL w, p, s and d! I like the DVD extras, the interviews with the stars of the movie, I was kind've hoping that Jennifer Grey would be interviewed but, alas, no. All in all I liked it! For those who take themselves way to seriously-lighten up-it's just entertainment!"
4,Great Classic,This is a classic movie and I was greatly entertained for about the 13th time. The CD was of good quality and I would recommend it to others who wish to watch this classic and add it to their library.
5,Great Movie,"High quality DVD, loved it so much I have loaned it out and now do not know who has it. May need to buy a second one."
3,Am i supposed to take this seriously?,"What the hell is this?American patriotism from the 80's.Its badly acted with a bad plot(but nice shootout scenes) and its full of ""We are americans even our high-school kids can beat the russian commandos because we are more patriotic and russians are cold-blooded blood thirsty murderers"" im sorry to say but i hate this kind of movies.I didn't even like them in the 80's just plain boring BUT if you don't take this seriously but laugh at the over-patriotic message you might like it,its so bad youll love it."
3,"Entertaining and funny, if creepy","If you have any Russian guests over one night you might want to avoid putting this one on. Those damn commies from Cuba and the USSR have invaded our soil and its up the some small town red-blooded teens to teach 'em who's boss!This film is so silly and implausible. If military conflict happened between us and the Soviets it would certainly be a matter of nukes, not invasion. The Soviets had a hard enough time invading countries like Finland and Afghanistan, they would never be so stupid to launch a ground assault on their rivals' large homeland.Basically, if you're a paranoid 200 lbs. good ol' boy from Montana who enjoys training his 8 year old kids how to use a sniper rifle then this movie is for you, Its odd how this movie is so beloved by the right wing, yet it could easily be made as an argument against the war in Iraq. The Iraqi teenagers our troops are battling just might be feeling the same way Charlie and Patrick did."
1,"Does not run well, and messy too","I have used this vacuum for over a year now. I consistently have trouble with the belts staying on. I cannot count the number of times I've had to unscrew the plate underneath and reattach the belts. If it even rolls over something uneven on the floor, the belt comes off and the beater brush stops moving.Also, although ""bagless"" sounded great, this vacuum is very, very messy to clean out. I have to take it outdoors and the dust goes everywhere.It also does not have a lot of sucking power through the attachments.I write this review today because the beater bar stopped turning and all belts are attached. I have taken this vacuum apart for the last time..."
1,Worst vacuum cleaner I've ever owned,"The belt comes off all the time. Sometimes I can use it for a few minutes, but most of the time, I can't even engage the brushes before it comes off. Sometimes it will rip the belt in the process. I'm on my third belt, and I don't use it very often.We went with this vacuum over a Dyson, because although we needed something really good, we didn't want to pay $600 for it. Big mistake. It doesn't even pick up hair as well as my old $100 vacuum cleaner.Stay away from this model. Just to be safe, stay away from Hoover altogether. The fact that this item made it through their quality assurance tests really says something about the company."
3,update,"Just purchase this vacuum and love the way it picks up and the way it moves. It is a very heavy vacuum and really hate the bagless chamber, feel dirty after empting the chamber and will be returning it for that reason and hope to find one with a bag. If you have allergies do not get the bagless one unless you have a sucker to empty it for you."
2,Doesn't last,"I bought this vacuum from Target several years ago. It works great as long as the filter is clean and the canister is empty, but the HEPA filter clogs easily and it is a chore cleaning out the canister (actually must shower after emptying canister). Also, now that it is several years old, the self propel does not work very well, and the plastic pieces have chipped or broken. For the money, I thought this would last longer. I'm now looking at the Dyson."
4,Lots of Golfing Fun,"Dad's Golf Story, by Alan Hayes, is a fantastic coloring book about golf. My three year old son absolutely loves this book. He'll ask for it to be read over and over and over again. The rhyming lyrics and simple pictures are at once a basic introduction to golf and intensely attracting to youngsters.This book will make a fine introduction to golf for a child, but can also be just a fun coloring book."
3,quick info,"If you're looking for a few quick examples of chinese folklore, this is a pretty good book. It's not very indepth, though. It presents maybe 30 or so stories in a condensed form... maybe that's the way there were told.A good reference book. Pictures too."
2,Bad Quality,"I LOVE the idea of this bracelet but this is the second one I've ordered, only for it to break the second day I had it on (again). I recommend finding another company who makes a similar product as this one is just terribly quality."
4,good fan,"Fan works well and is priced right. Simple design which usually means less chance of something breaking down. It's fairly quiet on the low setting, but at med & high it gets loud (though it does move alot of air). Some of the reviews praised how quiet they thought it was. I was expecting something whisper quiet which this is not. But it's not annoyingly loud either. Definitely worth the price IMHO."
5,Overall Great CD,"I first heard ""On My Own"" and bought the single. Then I bought the album and I love it. It's really great. It mixes sad and happy songs, and has dance, pop, and electronic beats. Perfect for anyone."
5,Excellent Holiday CD,"I bought it for my husband, who is not that musically inclined and he loves it too! Easy listening in the car or home."
4,"Aftertones, Janis Ian","I was a big fan of Janis Ian 30 years ago, but then I had vinyl records of Janis.Hearing the CD now is wonderfull, I remember every song in detail and I'm back into my 20's again. I enjoy it very much! The quality is good."
3,does it really work?,"I'm not sure if its my imagination, but I think this does help pull in a weak signal- not by much, but will give you one extra bar in your basement or an elevator. I have used them on a number of phones, and now just add them as a matter of course. Kinda like a Ouija board I guess."
3,Did not see any difference in signal strength,"I bought this for my phone because we live in a rural area. I didn't notice any increase in signal strength or reception. I would not buy this product for myself again, but it may work for someone else based on the area that they live."
2,"THESE DONT WORK....MAYBE THEY WERE MADE FOR THOSE OLD, OLD, OLD, VERY OLD CELL PHONES!","I WAS SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BUY THOU THE PRICE WAS MORE THEN REASONABLE...THEY SIMPLY JUST DONT ""BOOST"" YOUR CELL PHONES SIGNAL....ITS A SHAME REALLY, ITS A CHEAP HOPE YOU CARRY THAT THEY WILL WORK...BUT IT DOESNT STOP ME FROM BUYING FROM AMAZON, EVERYONE HAS BUYS THAT ARENT AS GOOD AS YOU WISH, THIS IS JUST AN ITEM I WOULDNT BUY AGAIN!!"
5,Lasko 16 in fan,I bought the lasko fan and when i recived it i put it togther and started using it. I was one of the best fans that i have ever bought. The fan moved alot of air and that is VERY important in the south where the tempature gets in the 90's. I have had other lasko products and they have all been good fans.
4,"""Back Cover Text"" here is wrong","The ""Back Cover Text"" for this book is the description pasted from the UNIX Visual QuickStart book. The back of the book actually just includes some points about why the Visual QuickPro series is helpful, and a short blurb about the author (me).I'm giving the book a ""4"" because I wrote it (so you wouldn't believe a ""5,"" and a ""3"" would suggest that it was terrible), and because I've used it as a reference myself a few times since it was published.- chrish"
5,We-OOO-We-OOO,"A real good tribute disk. Best Buy had it on thier demo TV's for several weeks before I broke down and bought it. I feel like I got my money's worth. One way I judge a disk is it's ""Watch Again"" likelyhood. I'll definately do that with this disk."
3,Pleasant British comedy,"A mousey fellow and a golddigger go on their honeymoon and discover that a convention of morticians are in the same hotel, which is disturbing, particularly since he is a thanatophobic. The jokes are hit and miss, though there are some very good ones and others that fail, but it's a pleasant comedy overall. There are some morbid, if not grotesque, scenes as is to be expected with morticians. The ending is predictable and I wouldn't be spoiling it by saying that the couple reconcile after they initially split up, though why would anyone want to go back to that woman is beyond me."
2,It is not Faulty Towers,I was hoping that the movie would be along the same lines as Faulty Towers. It was not close.
5,Rosa does everything,"It's amazing how someone so talented could go unknown for so long. Rosa has the rare vocal quality to put so much emotion in every word she sings. The material present in this disc goes from haunting ballad to swinging big band treatments. In her ballads you can hear the influence of Billy & Sarah, singing of loss and pain in a way so beautiful it makes you cry. The larger orchestrations remind you of the days when all live musicians in a band could raise the hairs on the back of your neck. With so much going on Rosa never gets lost, and that sweet,clear voice comes through to hold you in its embrace. More than just a bossa nova artist Rosa proves she can sing everything from jazz to blues to bossa nova."
4,"Good product, but some poor packaging","This was the first time I'd tried this brand, and I liked all the items, but the cleanser had leaked in the original bag and it leaked again when (after carefully tightening the cap) I traveled with it. Leak-proofness is critical for ""travel-size"" items. The other design problem is that the cleanser, scrub, and toner are in bottles with too small a base, so they tip over very, very easily on a countertop. Some minor design improvements to packaging would have earned this a five-star review. I'd suggest buying regular sizes of the items you want and transferring a small amount to your own travel containers."
5,Reveiw of Red Planet,"When I was in fourth grade, a few years ago(I'm 11, just out of sixth grade), one of my freinds told me I should read Starship Troopers. I loved it so much that I looked for as many other books as I could find. A few I didn't read, because they looked like romance. The others, including Red Planet, I read. Red Planet was my favorite. It was so good, I read it in two days.(Mind you I was in fourth grade)I loved the Willis so much, everything on the web(e-mail,web page, etc.) that is mine, is named after him. You'll love the book. The best I've ever read."
3,"Interesting concepts, tame plot","The first couple of chapters brought up some cool concepts, what with the prospect of learning about life on Mars, but the story was very predictable and a little drawn out.As headstrong as the protagonists were, I found that there were a lot of moments where they had their conflicts resolved for them (unless you count Willis as a protagonist), which sort of limited their character development.The language was also noticeably very adult, being spoken through kids who are supposed to be preteens. Maybe a sign of the times? I don't know.This might have been much better as a short story, especially for keeping the attention of a younger person.I learned some time near the end of reading this that this was one of Heinlein's first books, so I can certainly understand that he was just ""getting in the groove."""
4,Decent,"Ah, the Black Crowes, a great band, and nearly impossible to categorize. This is one band that truly knows how to rock. Songs like ""Struttin' Blues"" and ""Thick 'N' Thin"" are good examples of this. They can also do soulful ballads really well, such as ""Seeing Things"", ""She Talks to Angels"", and my personal favorite, ""Sister Luck"". This band is a bit different from the bands I normally listen to (but then again there's really no one else that sounds like them), but they're still great. Their Zeppelin stuff with Jimmy Page is awesome, too. Oh, and the critic above mentions a title track, but I don't know what he's talking about, because there isn't one. Anyway, check out the Crowes, they rock."
3,The black Crows from USA,"I recommend this seller, the package was strong and the delivery was very fast.Concerning the music that a friend recommended me 12 years ago when I was in Philadelphia...I can say this is good music but a little bit too heavy metal for me...luckily in 12 years, we change a lot!"
5,Never gets old,"This is the kind of CD you can put on repeat and just drive down the road. You can feel the anguish in every song, and yet they never leave you feeling hopeless. This is an album about suffering through and carrying on.. such an emotional release. So sing along, tap your feet, and air drum without shame! This rocks from start to finish.""Ain't bending over backwards baby, not to please!.. Cause I'm seeing things for the first time"""
4,well ok i guess ...,"Well this is good for a final touch to your collection (but dont buy it as your first movie You wont enjoy the whole tape).i must recoment that you buy the 3 videos before this one, they will all add up to be a good collection after you buy them all.i once had a up-all-night non-stop DBZ strek of videos and this was a great ending after seeing nothing but DBZ all night.... the next day i got sleep an went out to buy the 1st GARLIC JR tape"
1,What A Professional Historian Says,"From John Lukacs (If you don't know who he is you shouldn't be reading ""history"") in ""The Hilter [or anyone else] Of History, pp.24,25: |""This was the fad (I am loath to give it another name)of psychohistory, meaning not merely the application of psychology to historical figures ... but of psychoanalytic 'technique,' predominantly Freudian, to their subject. This is not the place to argue against, or even to sum up, the essential and, yes, shortsighted faults of Freudianism, save to say that if their application to the diagnosis and the therapy of living human beings is often questionable, this must be even more so when it comes to the application of psychoanalysis to the dead."""
4,lutz is a little clumsy/but not enough,"but not enough-to much attention to craft, writerliness,et keeps lutz-wagon upright. I do wish these supposed ""experimentalists-new fictioneers would break free from ""learned conventions""-even a momentary loss would do. Lutz shows glimpses of one desiring to make the leap but I suppose the creative writer in him just wont allow it."
4,Kathleen Battle at Carnegie Hall,Kathleen Battle has a georgious voice. I like her and will try and find her other cd's. I was a little disappointed in the songs though. I am not a huge opera fan. I like lite opera more and usually buy those kind. Kathleen sings Summer Time and it is wonderful!.
2,Cheaply made!,"I read about the idea of natural vision correction and decided to try these. I paid close to $20 for them including shipping. They are NOT worth that price. They are cheap plastic that isn't sturdy, they do not stay on your face. The instructions say ""drop in hot water"" and reform?? Sounds like something you'd so with sunglasses won at the fair.They are worth about $5 max. They WORK per se, if you are not moving around. I think I could have made my own with some frames and some screen from Home Depot."
2,Pin holes too large,I tried a version of these before but the pinholes were small. I do believe that pin hole glasses help one's vision but not when the pin holes are too large.
1,Garbage,"I am a fan of trashy horror movies (a guilty pleasure), but found this one painful to sit through. I'm sure the intention of the film-makers was to convey some noble theme like ""the only real monsters are the human kind"", but this film was so poorly made that any message became moot in the process. Dreadful acting, an inane script, horrible production quality (parts of it appeared to be filmed on home video!), and a monster that looked like a sock-puppet with a cutesy cartoon character voice, combined to make this a strong contender for worst movie of all time. Don't waste your time or money!"
1,"I Did Not Get A ""0"" Star Option","I am NOT trying to be funny; this is the worst movie I have ever seen. The movie rental place should've sued me for renting such a bad ""movie""."
1,absolute trash!,"I could not believe how bad this movie was. I am a fan of horror movies and I thought the box looked ok for a low-budget horror film.I barely made it through the entire movie! It was awful! There was alot of needless murder and bloodshed. I thought that the""item"" was the silliest looking thing I had ever seen!I tried to get a refund or exchange from the video store but I could'nt. I threw it in the trash!!Please don't purchase this video or Dvd until you have rented it.Then you can be your own judge.I wish I could go back in time and leave that trash on the shelf!"
4,a gift of memories,Bought for a friend who had had the album when she was younger. She was happy to get it. It brought bacl a lot of memories for her.
4,Pretty good,"I am a big fan of these old 50'-60's cop shows. The stories are good though sometimes really formulaic ,prints are decent enough. Addicting show but the main complaint is the endings are way too abrupt which is really the only complaint. For the price this is still a must own set and is great to lounge back watching a few episodes at a time on a lazy weekend morning with coffee and donuts."
2,Unimpressed,"I was looking for a fan with a stronger air flow than my basic 20"" Lasko box fan. I looked around and saw the Lasko 3300 and thought it looked like it would fit the bill. When I got home I plugged it in and did a side by side comparison with my old box fan. I was surprised to find that there was no difference between the two. It's back in the box to be returned. I ended up purchasing a Honeywell Turbo Force medium size fan and it is a much better fit for me. It provides a much better air flow and takes up far less space. If I could afford it I would have purchased a Vornado as I have a friend that has a couple of different styles and they are awesome, but the Honeywell is a good second choice."
1,misrepresented pressure cooker,"The blurb for this pressure cooker doesn't mention that it only operates at 10 psi, not the usual adjustable 5, 10, 15 psi. So this is a good product if you want to do the math to convert all your pressure cooker recipes. I don't. I sent it back."
3,Cooks Great-Pressure Problem,"I received this cooker for Christmas 2008 ( a Wal Mart purchase).It was my first pressure cooker, and it cooked wonderfully (though it was a bit tight for two chickens); until it failed.After about 6 uses, it would no longer establish pressure. The red pop up on the handle (indication that pressure was up and handle locked) started popping up to about twice the height it normally emerged from the handle (when the cooker worked) and steam vented from all around the handle junction with the lid.I tried everything the book said to do. The handle was tight. I inspected, streched and oiled the gasket. No luck. I called Mirro (Wearever) and they told me to boil the gasket for 15 min. and then oil it. I did all these things, to no avail.So I returned it. Now I'm going to try Presto."
1,He Touched Me - Elvis Presley,I was very dissapointed in this CD - I cannot play it in my CD player in my Murano - it simply will not play - it plays in the CD player in the house but not in the car -----
4,"Elvis, God and the Devil","I am not a Christian but i do like gospel music. It's amazing to see the drugs,food and sex addicted Elvis performing such great gospel songs. What a performer and what a man he was.I really liked this dvd and it's worth the money.A great docu and great music."
2,To less music,"I think Elvis gospels are great. The problem with this nice DVD is that it's filled for more than 50% of people who are talking about Elvis. The one thing I did not like was that the songs, which I think are the most important, are cut into pieces with people who are talking about Elvis. There is no way that you can listen and see Elvis perform without the talking. For the diehards it's a real must, but for me who like the songs the most, will give this DVD away."
5,Uncanny,"This film portends the present understanding of global warming as a threat known by an ancient civilization. It was made long before most people were thinking about anything like a ""last"" wave. Haunting"
2,Only Two Good Points,"There are only two good points for this snoozer. (1. The part where the murder takes place is quite powerful and very well done, and (2. Richard Chamberlain looks good in glasses. Other than that, ""The Last Wave"" drowns in its own inconsistancies."
1,a good novel ruined by a bad actor,"This movie is based on Mario Puzo's book of the same name: in other words, the source material here isn't that different from that of 'The Godfather'. It's a good book in the same way that 'The Godfather' is - exciting and rousing - but that isn't enough to make a good movie. Whereas Francis Ford Coppola and Marlon Brando made what many consider to be the best movie of all time, Michael Cimino and Christopher Lambert made a real stinker here. Actually, the problem less with Cimino than it does with Lambert. His attempt to play a Sicilian is bad enough; when you compare him to his co-star John Turturro he comes across as positively horrible. The beautiful scenery and some good acting from other cast members still can't save this movie. Avoid it."
1,A piece of elementary school potty filth,"I knew this was a parody when I purchased it, but thought it would be fun to read. I read the first chapter and part way into the second chapter and was so disgusted, I threw it on the couch. My husband looked it over a bit and threw it into the waste basket. I have read books that had bad words and bad scenes before, but this was written purposely to shock like an elementary school child that has discovered he could shock people with certain words. It is not the least bit funny or sophisticated, but is childish and dirty jsut for the sake of being dirty."
1,Cat Who Killed....Should be Buried,"The Cat Who Killed Lilian Jackson Braun is a waste of good money. I was expecting a delicious satire, at least on a par with LJB. Instead, it is obviously a quickly and poorly written attempt to slam The Cat Who series and the legions of devoted fans of the series. My husband and I both threw this hairball of a book down with a very loud ACCCHHHKKKKKK! Someone could have written a truly readable and funny satire. This one is not it. I say we give it a decent and prompt burial."
1,Stinks like a litter box,"This is not a parody, it is absolute trash. A parody should be funny and interesting. I do not know where the press reviews came from but they must have been bought. This book is full of disgusting sexual descriptions, probably indicating that the book was written by an ignorant juvenile male. I do not think that Robert Kraplow is talented enough to understand that discussing his sexual preversions and tendencies is not really a parody of Lillian Jackson Braun, but of himself. Wish that I had read the other reviews before I wasted my money. I cannot even donate this book - I would not wish this trash on anyone else."
1,The Cat Who Killed Lilian Jackson Braun,"Wish I had read the reviews before buying this book. Thought it was trash, Usually give books I don't want to Public Library but will be burning this garbage. Only read first and last chapter but that was more than enought for me to endure. I found it was nothing like the wonderful books Lilian Jackson Braun writes and wish I had never heard of it. Would like to rate this book a minus 5 but the computer wouldn't let me , that is the only reason It got 1 star."
1,Braun fans will not like it,"If you are like me and enjoy the Lilian Jackson Braun books , because they lack graphic violence and are just easy, simple and pleasant stories, than you will not like this book. It has a lot of sexual and graphic language. I bought the audio version (used, thankfully) and tossed it in the garage sale pile before 1/2 way through. Braun fans; don't waste your money!"
1,Should have left it where it belongs,"This alleged parody of Lilian Jackson Braun's ""Cat Who..."" series belongs in the litter box. Sure, the LJB franchise has been going downhill for quite some time, but not nearly deserving of this dumper. It's not parody - it's a lame excuse for porn. Adolescent boys might get off on it, but other than that, it's catty and pointless and puerile and prurient and stinks worse that the other stuff in the litter box. Reviewed by TundraVision"
1,"Tasteless, childish","I guess I'm one of the little old ladies, but I could not finish this book. All the scatology would appeal to 8-year-old boys, but they are too young for the sexual scenes. I just found this book too stupid to waste my time reading it. It is too bad this review system does not allow for negative stars."
1,Why is there no zero for ratings?,I read 14 pages and was so disgusted I had to throw it in the trash bin. What a shameful way to use our favorite author's name. It was not funny unless you're a 14 year old boy. This book is NOT for fans of Lilian's Cat Who novels. Stay away! Stay far away!
4,Fair and Fascinating study,"I imagine it would be difficult to write an unbiased book about near-death experiences, especially if you had a religious bone to pick. However, Carol Zaleski succeeds in writing a very scholarly, fair-minded book, and avoids the trap of attempting to envangelize the reader. Either you believe people have out-of-body experiences, or you don't and Zaleski doesn't attempt to convert you. What she does do (and this is what makes ""Otherworld Journeys"" so fascinating) is examine the influence of culture and religion on near-death experiences. A twentieth-century American will not report the same near-death experience as, say, a thirteenth-century Italian. Why that is true is for the reader to decide, in light of the evidence presented by this interesting and well-researched account.I felt ""Otherworld Journeys"" was a definite keeper and well worth re-reading."
5,MOTHERS PLASTIC POLISH REALLY WORKS,THIS WORK WITH A HIGH SPED BUFFER TOOK ALL THE FOGGYNESS OF THE LIGHTS.COULDNT BELIEVE IT
4,Nice bag but too small for MacBook Pro,This bag is designed to carry a notebook in addition to your camera gear. But it was just a bit too small to fit my MacBook Pro. I could make it fit but the sides of the bag would bulge out and it did not feel like the laptop was protected. Good for notebook computers up to 13 inches wide (MacBook Pro is 14.1 inches wide). I had to return it (the bag not the computer) :-(
5,Perfect Camera Bag for the 40D,"The Canon 100DG camera bag was the perfect purchase for my Canon 40D. The size, quality, and looks are excellent. I fully recommend."
5,perfect,Makes the correct sound . Is easy to operate.like the color\ too. I like it very much. I recommend it to anyone needing a tambourine.
5,This is a MUST HAVE item for your camera's LED,"In that the body of my camera is Black, this unit works extremely well. The protection afforded as well as the serious reduction of glare on the LED screen makes this a MUST HAVE item in my opinion. Well worth the money to say the least."
5,"A special, complete and clear book.","Dear Mr. Louis: I bought your book Horary Astrology: Plain and Simple via Amazon.com two monthes ago. Well, it's very, very good. A special, complete and clear book. I've already finished my first reading and now I'm studying and reading it again and again with gratitude and happiness. It will help me a lot in my Astrology work. If a person really enjoys Astrology, she would have this book as a precious gift."
5,"Thorough and understandable, an excellent reference","Horary is one of the more difficult branches of astrology. In this book, the author takes the pain out of horary. He presents the subject clearly and logically so it all comes together and makes sense. If you've been afraid to tackle horary, fear no more. This book is a delight: easy to read, thorough, relatively painless, and sprinkled through with a good measure of humor."
2,good playing...altough,"I think I like more his Chopin than Debussy. I feel it's little bit too academic playing, lacking a spiritual concept in conjunction with a little bit on romantic site. Debussy can not be romantic, when that appeals in a quality of playing it becomes schmaltz. I would recommend Giorgi Latsabidze's interpretation of Debussy's Preludes where you find and discover a great range of varies colors and make you really forget that a piano is a percussion instrument. Latsabidze's tone is very rare and recording is superb, although he recorded only second book."
1,I guess I expected better artwork than what my dog can draw with a pencil tied to his tail.,"That says it all, folks. Bad drawing. Nonexistent punchlines. Over-the-top ideology that seems to come right from the can labelled ""100% Hackneyed Conservative Viewpoints, Always Fresh, Never Stale"".I like all types of comix. This isn't really a comic, though. Just a collection of half-baked one-liners. Go buy Mallard Fillmore instead."
1,"I'm conversative, and this offends me.","Isn't there enough ammunition and fodder for a convseratively-skewed comic strip without having to constantly revert to first-grade put-downs and ""make-you-go-hmm"", head-scratching references to fat people?Do we also need such poorly drawn characters that their images change or morph almost weekly (that is, if the comic isn't simply 1 unedited panel repeated 4 times with different speech balloons)? Yes, I know the art in Doonesbury is outsourced now, but still--those characters are drawn by someone who obviously cares. You don't feel punished for having to look at that comic strip, unlike the feeling I get while reading Prickly City."
5,Good for reference or a good read,"The topics presented in The Handy Science Answer Book are very well explained. It's a great book for anyone interested in science. When I first got the book at age 13, I thought I'd use it mainly as reference. As I read more of it I decided to just read straight through. Every topic was something I'd always wanted to know a little more about."
5,a very erotic book!,"I read this book based on the amazon reviews and I was not disappointed. The plot was very simple. Edward contrived to get Florence married to his gay brother, Freddie. But it is Edward and Florence who are attracted to each other. But the story was well written, compared with other simliar ""erotic"" novels i've read. You could totally feel the attractive they felt toward each other. And I'd agree w/ the other reviewers. Holly set up the characters first before they got together. By then the tension between them is so great we can't well.I would only take off maybe a half point for the supposed conflict which Holly set up. (which made Florence mad at both brothers eventually). It didn't feel quite believable, esp after the reader has become so involved in the feelings of Florence and Edward.But other than that, one of the best books i've read recently!"
4,"Tantalizingly Erotic Without Being Cutesy, Holly Can WRITE!","The only thing that kept me from giving this book five stars is the embarrassing cover art; it looks like the old ""True Confessions"" pulp fiction stuff, and I confess, I still won't read this thing outside of my bedroom because of the artwork. That aside, though, the book is marvelous, and THIS WOMAN CAN WRITE! I can't remember when I have read a novel that so transported me into time and place. Miss Holly is a natural story teller. Moreover, she is not afraid to write about real sexual feelings, in all of their dark, conflicted realities - and she is able to write about adult sexuality without euphemisms or cutesy words, and she is forthright and frank when writing about the homosexual character as well. While the story itself is a little thin (I'd call it a character study more than a story as we know early on who the ""bad guy"" is going to be) it's extremely entertaining, witty and quite breathtakingly erotic. Buy it, you'll like it!"
3,OKAY....,"So this book was hot and steamy in some parts but I really didn't feel that I was in the 1800ths with the dialogue. I did like the relationship between the hero and the heroine, and it's not like alot of romance stories out there. But, I would have to say that this is a book that I will not read again."
1,Check your sound card first!,"I bought this for my son a couple years ago, thinking he could get a head start on geography. The only problem is that we don't have the proper sound files for this program on either of our Dell computers. It states on the box even, without the proper sound files, it won't work. I didn't see those requirments when I bought this item, so I would recommend looking more into computer games before buying them online. I've found that often times, valid information is missing."
1,I love the USA,This product does not offer any real information in recognizing states by shape or placement in the country. I found the information it offered to be ineffective to learning the geography of this country.
2,Norman Mailer plays guitar,"That is, Bloomfield should have stuck to guitar playing, as Mailer should stick to writing. This effort in my view is basically just a ... of the Bloomfield name. Wofully lacking in content or a story line. Save your money for his recordings."
4,That Certain Summer,"Dani (Fernando Ramallo) and Nico (Jordi Vilches) are two teenage friends who spend one summer together in the seaside near Barcelona. They are skinny, a bit awkward and average in looks, a lot like a lot of sixteen or seventeen-year-old boys who are experimenting with sex with each other and with girls. It may be just a phase that Nico is going through but Dani figures out, and is comfortable with his feelings, that he would rather spend time with Nico than with anyone else. As he tells Nico on one occasion: ""I would watch you all day long."" The film is in no way exploitive and shouldn't offend the most conservative of viewers. The sex between the young men hardly exists; the small amount of nudity is tastefully done. The naturalism of the film is refreshing and totally believable.The two young men spend a lot of time on the beach in scenes that are beautifully filmed in this sweet coming-of-age film that will not disappoint you."
4,Great Coming of Age Film!,"This was a fun, simple flick about two teenage friends spending the summer together, doing what boys do. The film focuses on the decisions they make, their responses to hormones, the future, girls, drugs, each other...The acting is great, the characters likeable, and well-developed. If you enjoyed Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN then you should have no trouble getting into this one."
5,One of my favourites,"I doubt it is possible to squeeze out more beauty of these works of melancholy, passion, delicacy and intimacy. All the playing is impeccable, very sensitive and Dumay's tune has sometimes a mystical aspect. The 1st sonata sets out with a lazy introversion, even some anguish; the second is less sad and more brainy, a very intelligent and highly varied work; the third bring us back to melancholy but ends passionately agitated. Highly recommended."
2,The Mennonite Tourguide to Western Europe,"I bought this in preparation for a genealogy-focused trip to Europe. It had been recommended by a friend, but I found it to be woefully outdated, poorly printed, and in dire need of proof-reading. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for travel information."
4,Very sturdy construction - excellent grill,"This is a very sturdily made hibachi, not like the throw-awayitems that one usually finds in the lawn and garden center of the local department store. The heavy gauge cast-iron construction will ensure that this grill lasts for a long time. The grilling surface is large enough to comfortably fit a few large steaks or many burgers. Grilling over charcol with a bit of mesquite or other wood chip thrown in gives a wonderful flavour to the food."
3,Score Pad not as pictured.,"I DID NOT RECEIVE THE SCORE PAD THAT IS PICTURED.This one does not have a place for sub-totals;it is for BOTH Mexican Train and Chicken Foot.It works, if you keep a sideways sub-total."
1,Awful score pad.,"I purchased Mexican Train as I had family coming to visit. The set itself came with a score pad, but I really liked the layout of the score pad pictured here. However, that is not the pad they sent. The problem I have with score pads is that they don't seem to want to give you room to keep a running total as well as keep track of each games points. This pad would have let us do that, but as I stated above they didn't send the pictured pad. Luckily my Aunt had a better pad with her that let us keep track of totals and each games points. Now yes you can add the whole thing up ad the end, but that is a TON of math! Anyway just beware that you may not be sent the pad that is pictured."
4,Protective Pouch,"Pouch was received in a fair amount of time for the shipping method that I chose. There really isn't anything wrong with it, but it only holds the actual GPS unit itself. It does not hold the cradle or the stand that I also bought. I cannot fault anyone for this because it was my choice and at least I do have something to protect the GPS unit. If you only need something to protect the unit, then this is the item for you."
4,Beyond a doubt,Page turner. Love the series. Can't wait to get the next one. Need to read all her books. Good book.
4,More mystery than romance,"The book was more mystery than romance which would not be all bad if there was a happily ever after. There wasn't. At least not in this book. The only thing that kept me from being furious with the ending was knowing the happily ever after comes in the next book in the series. As far as the mystery, it was good. It was almost at the end before I figured it out. Okay, kinda figured it out. As for Nick the fireman, REALLY dislike him! Getting a little tired of Davy's whining. I know. Unfair. He's just a child. Moving on to book 3 in the series."
2,Not one of Maysa's better records.,"Wow! Surpised at all the 5 star reviews! There isn't a cut on this CD that is as good as the original version. I love listening to Maysa, and have all her solo albums as well as the Incognito albums. This one is just fair, mostly because the songs, while good, are not given the extra life or energy required to justify a remake. Maysa shows up, but I was waiting for that one song where she would break out, like she does on so many of her better cuts. The backing band, is just OK, and sounds mostly electronic. Betcha by Golly Wow is an example of a song that plodded along without coming to life. And the Roberta Flack masterpiece at the end, remains Roberta's. Still, not a bad CD. Will keep buying Maysa's work because she is a great soul singer, but this one sounds more like something you'd hear from a band in a cruise ship lounge."
5,A desert island among Beethoven cycles,"There are many cycles of Beethoven's 5 Piano Concertos. Almost every great pianist has recorded their own renditionon those essential works. However, this wonderful cycle with Kempff/Van Kempen could be taken as the absolute reference.Very seldom we can find such a wonderful combination of the ideal soloist/conductor/orchestra and so this is the case.Great historical performances in very good sound that make of this a first choice. Get it with confidence."
2,Great Dissappointment,"This was a huge dissappointment for me. They do not even sing the complete songs on many of them. Olivia sounds alright, but the male performers ruin it. I think that the worse one is Anthony Warlow. Many of the songs do not sound good at all, and the background music is horrible. When the guys do a solo or sing along with Olivia, at times it is painful. Especially on ""Summer Nights,"" and ""Let Me Be There."" This is really awful, even concidering that it is a live performance. It does have some great moments, though."
1,Don't be Fooled,"In another attempt to continue making money off of the amazing Lucy Montgomery - her estate (or editors) have decided to split the books ""The Story Girl"" and ""The Golden Road"" in to 4 or 5 separate books - or they have watered down the actual content. No doubt charging full price for all of the books. The original stories are wonderful and beautifully written. Mrs. Montgomery herself, indicated that these books were closest to her heart. So, in order to read the stories in the correct chronological order and save yourself some money - just buy the two previously mentioned novels and enjoy!!"
4,It's what we needed,"Installed in master bath to supplement insufficient heating from other sources. It heats the room nicely in a short time and makes just enough noise that we don't forget to turn it off. What I didn't like was the fact that it was advertised as a unit with a grill, but when it arrived it was clear the grill was a cheap substitute for something that looked good. The grill cost another $35! And I might have bought another brand if I had seen the total price before buying."
5,One of Ten Best Fantasy Books of All Time,"One of Ten Best Fantasy Books of All Time - If you like Fantasy Books, you have to read this one. It is not as well known as some of the other classics like Lord of the Rings, but this book puts you in the world of magic and dragons. Captures the imagination in every way. Jump in and enjoy!"
5,The undisputed comedy king.,"Andrew Dice Clay is the undisputed king of comedy. His rhymes are outrageously funny. Hell his whole entire act is funny. I recommend that everyone sees this video. I also recommend all his albums. And if the Diceman ever reads this, you are the greatest Dice."
4,Dice At His Best,"If you like Mother Goose.....OH! This is a DVD for you. This is the Madison Square Garden concert when Dice was at his highest point of his career. Dice acts, sings, and slices & dices the J-Offs in the audience.Dice is one of the most popular comedians in Las Vegas. His new CD from 2000 showed that he is back.Just laugh your a... off!!"
2,no..I don't like it,"I really wanted to like this recording but actually I think I hate it. The sound is fat and cholestral filled, and Levine's direction is okay (the fugal climax of the Credo goes tremendously well) but... it's only a minor quibble but at the start of the Agnes Dei the orchestra can't even begin in unison which with repeated listenings is annoying. Dare I say that Domingo strains his way through the whole thing and Studer is utterly unsuited to the Benedictus, wailing like a banshee. Stick to Gardiner or for a bigger sound Karajan with the superb Janowitz."
3,weakest link in _Tales_ series,"I am an unabashed addict of Armistead Maupin's _Tales of the City_ series. That said, _Further Tales_ could possibly be the weakest link in this beguiling sequence of books. This one focuses more on secondary characters to the 28 Barbary Lane gang, folks that are materialistic, fame-mongering and just plain less interesting and hard to care about. That said, Maupin's less powerful stories are better than most other writers, and while the series can best be described as literary bon-bons, he has a strong narrative and great sense of characterization that ""serious"" writers like Don Delillo would kill for."
3,#3,"If you could only get one of Amistead Maupin's Tales series, this is not the one to get. I've read all 3 of the Tales and this one was a bit disappointing. The characters seem so different that I almost found it distracting that he used the same names. Sure characters should evolve, but there just wasn't a smooth transition from the 2nd book to this one as far as character development. Michael is not as lovable and fey as in the previous 2 books, and his relationship with MaryAnn has all but faded into mere allusions. It's still a worthy read, and I would still recommend it, but not before the other two."
4,More and more and more. The beat goes on...,"Further tales of Mary Ann Singleton and Michael Tolliver, Maupin's alter-ego, a sweet young gay man lookin' for love in all the wrong places. The continuation of Tales of the City, first serialized in the San Francisco Chronicle, follows the further calamitous adventures of the residents of 28 Barbary Lane. This series of books focused around the early ages of the Dark Age of the AIDS era, but the tragic effect is leavened by Maupin's wild and wacky sense of humor, the preposterous interweaving of the lives of these people, and an overwhelming love for nearly each and every character. As someone said, these books are a love letter to San Francisco and all the best that it stands for."
1,2 Swann DVR4- Alerts,"First DVR4-Alert was defective, it would not recognize any hard drives. It was exchanged for another DVR4-alert, this recognizes the hard drive but gives a hard drive failure error most times when recording after a few minutes. Units are not reliable enough for 24/7 security. Save yourself a head ache; spend more money and buy a better DVR."
2,Our dogs didn't watch,"The issue with dogs is that their sense of smell and hearing is so acute that they seldom pay attention to those things that humans enjoy. That is the case with this video. Our dogs would rather look out the window at real people, and while they will peek through the cracks in the fence to watch for other cats, dogs, and people, they completely ignored this DVD.I gave it two stars because I enjoyed watching it ... Once. Save yourself some money and just take your dog for a walk when you get home. Both of you will have more fun."
4,Good Bharatanatyam video on DVD,"You should buy it if you are seriously interested in the Indian Classical Dance as this is one of the first three Bharatanatyam videos that can be bought on DVD. It is professionally designed and filmed, and the dance performance is better than the one seen in Anita Ratnam's DVD, although the varnam part is less authentic and rather simple compared with far more elaborate elements seen in Medha Hari's DVD, as these elements require to be performed by a real virtuoso.All in all, unlike the other two Bharatanatyam DVDs, it is a good and clear introduction to Bharatanatyam done in the classical way, even though some elements of the technique may not be the purest Bharatanatyam, as Padma Chebrolu's style of Bharatanatyam, a US-based dancer, was heavily influenced by her studies in Kuchipudi, Andhra Natyam and Mohini Attam.I believe it is worth the price."
4,Lots of fun...even for a 9 month old,"My son loved to crawl back and forth and the mesh lets us see him and him see us...it is a little wobbly if you don't get it with the tent, so just put pillows on both sides."
5,Good gift,This looks so fun we bought it for our grandchildren. We thought the new little sister would loveto join in when she begins crawling too.
5,The next Jan Karon,"Read five pages of this wonderfully written gem and you'll know what the buzz on this site is all about. Some books just make you feel all warm inside -- A Can of Peas leads the pack.Traci DePree shows her skill with a pen in ways few writers can, which makes perfect sense -- she's been the editor behind many bestsellers over the years. A welcomed new voice in a genre that is begging for novels of this caliber. Bravo Traci."
4,Simplicity of Farm Life,"An excellent book that will open your eyes to the troubles and joys of midwest farm life. Learn to have more appreciation for the simple joys in life, right along with Peter and Mae. After all as Leonardo da Vinci said: ""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."""
5,Wonderful,"Even though there have been countless reviews for this book, I figured I would at least take a moment to comment on the book.A Can Of Peas is the first in a series about a newly married couple, Peter and Mae who move to a small farm to take over when Peters grandfather dies. A Can Of Peas show that life is not always simple and happy, but with the care and support of some close friends and neighbors, life can be a blessing even when it does not seem possible.I already had the third book, Aprons On A Clothesline and I just ordered Dandelions In A Jelly Jar from the library. I cant wait to read more about Peter, Mae and the gang."
4,There's just something about Lake Emily....,"Come visit Lake Emily, where a charming small town community welcomes newcomers Peter & Mae Morgan into their midst. Share the laughter and tears along with the Morgans, as they struggle to save the family farm and embrace life in a close-knit community so very different from the life they once had in the city. A heart-warming story that leaves you feeling uplifted and thankful for the simple joys in life, appealing to readers of Janette Oke, Jan Karon (Mitford series) Philip Gulley (Harmony series) Beverley LaHaye, Terri Blackstock (Seasons series). Looking forward to reading the sequel. ~~Ellie Schroder, owner of The Christian Fiction Site"
2,Do not waste your money on this expensive book...,"This book tries to asses Islamic identity to non believers and tries to show the relations between Islam and Secularism which are not exist in either. To me, some truths have been modified to fit into a category. I do not think this book worth of buying for 50 bucks."
4,Great Food Press!,"Always used grandmothers food press, but finally got one of my own! Will make tomato juice and jellies much easier. I recommend this food press!"
4,small but mighty,"I remember my mother canning tomatoes and using one of these. Other than it is seriously 1/3 the size of hers, it performed very well."
2,not for apples,"This item might work better for berries, tomatoes, grapes, etc, but it sure didn't work for making apple sauce or apple butter. I could barely get any of the apple product through the holes. Too much work. I'll try it for something else next time."
3,Half and Half,"I think half this record is excellent, the other half lame. I agree with a previous review - I don't understand the acclaim and Grammy. I'm a huge Lanois fan and love his production here. But even that can't save the pedestrian lyrics Bob treats us to here on many cuts. But 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are vintage, well worth the price of admission by themselves.DR"
4,"Great value, good reception","This is a very nice retro style and very cost effective (relatively small) table top radio that delivers excellent reception in both AM & FM - picking all 20 or so stations (AM / day). I paid $ 9.99 - a steal (hello Amazon: Please don't increase the price now!). It arrived perfectly packed. AC cable neatly tucked inside the housing. Although the radio is built to a budget, it is looking quite nice in beige & silver, with a dial that is easy to read. Highly recommended."
5,Surprising,"I had fairly low expectations about Barenboim's interpretation of the Rite and La Mer, but I was very wrong. This is an outstanding Rite and, I believe, one of the very best La Mers. I have never heard such clarity to the woodwinds in the Rite particularly in the Glorification of the Ancestors and the Fertility Dance. Barenboim brings a kind of luxuriant radiance to the work that has only been subtly hinted at in other performances. This is a Rite with ecstasy. Like so many other performances, this one lags in the final section, because it lacks sufficient forward momentum and orchestral clarity. The only performance that pulls this off perfectly is that of Zander, which is a must buy.This La Mer is powerfully romantic and it simply never disappoints or falters. It does have just a bit of schmaltz in the last section, but it expresses the great majesty of the sea as powerfully as any performance I am familiar with and I know many. I recommend this CD highly."
3,"Indeed a bit pompous, but has still a bigger issue","Think of ""Wired Style"" as the 'Chicago Manual of Style' (well, sort of) as stated by Newsweek back in 1999 when this book first came out, and you probably by now can realize where the fundamental problem of the book is. While it does come accross as a bit pompous at times, indeed, the biggest issue it has is the fact that it hasn't been updated since its first edition, five years ago, an entire lifetime by Internet standards. As a result, several ubiquitous terms that you run into everywhere today are missing: blog, RSS, CSS, XHTML, flat panel, and the list goes on and on. So, as much as they ditch the more conservative AP Stylebook, it is not that much better as a tool for editors/writers working in the ""digital age"", so I don't see much of a point in buying it at this point any more."
1,Elements of Pomposity,"This is the apotheosis of form triumphing over content. Put it in a slip cover! Print it on lime green paper! Give it one of those ring bindings! Oh...there's nothing to put in the book to make it worth buying...Never Mind!!!!Worse than all the very accurate criticisms already listed here, is the fact that this book isn't as desperately needed as Wired tries to make you think. Other style manuals are working feverishly to keep up with the challenges of the Web, and many of them are doing a good job.And please, Wired, can't the Web just be a great tool and a cool thing? Does it have to be a turning point for language, civilization, writing, the universe?"
2,So terminally hip it was retro-boring,"Ninety percent image, ten percent content; it's the hard cover version of a virtual waste of time"
1,wrong product description,"For 12 & 16 qt. MO406, 22 qt. MO622, MO526, & MO522 cannersthis Gasket is way too small for the Mo526, have to send it back"
3,Cute But Fragile,"These earrings are adorable and the perfect size for a pre-teen. However, I was very surprised/disappointed at how very thin the gold is--almost like wire. They bend quite easily and so require careful handling which I don't think you can always count on from a child! I worry too that the thinness will significantly impact durability. Maybe they're counting on the kid losing them before they come apart."
1,Earrings broke after only 2 weeks!!!,The backing broke in half after my daughter had only been wearing them for two weeks! Age was devastated because they were a Christmas gift!
3,Medieval Drama on a Modest Scale,"Louis Hayward returns from the War of the Roses to find his father murdered and his uncle now in charge of his estate.While this late-medieval drama lacks the budget, the color photography, and the big-name cast needed to give it the ""sweep"" which it deserves, the resulting effort moves briskly enough to hold one's interest for an efficiently-plotted 76 minutes. While the characters spend a bit too much time explaining the story to each other, or in reading messages which contain still more explanations, there are also enough sword-fights, jousts, cracking whips, and flying arrows to satisfy fans of the genre.George Macready makes a silky-smooth villain as the treacherous uncle but Louis Hayward, pushing forty at the time, is much too old to play a character who's often referred to ""the boy"" or ""the lad."""
5,"Bullseye for ""The Black Arrow""","The Louis Hayward film version of Robert Louis Stevenson's ""The Black Arrow"" is my favorite. The movie is a top-notch swashbuckler, with fine performances by Hayward, Janet Blair -- a spirited co-star, George Macready in another well-wrought villainous turn as Sir Daniel, and the always amusing, if anachronistic, Edgar Buchanan -- straight out of a Western and into 15th-century England!The story, at a brisk 76 minutes, moves along apace, with fine archery, swordplay, and a brutal concluding joust punctuating a compelling tale of high romance.The Sony Pictures ""Columbia Classics By Request"" DVD is bare bones: just the film with 10-minute auto chapters. It is not widescreen, as Amazon advertises -- the film was released in 1948, some five years before the debut of Cinemascope, but the print is pristine and the DVD is well-worth the $20 sale price.Highly recommended for fanciers of the swashbuckler, and classic film fans in general."
1,A Waste of Money,"If you are looking for a collectible to sit in a box and never get used, this may be for you. If you want to actually take it out of the box and see it work you are better served throwing your money in the nearest trash bin. The alarm doesn't work at all. If you want a limited selection of what Homer says you can use the demo button but it does not sing as advertised. It also doesn't look like the clock in the picture for this ad exactly. It's a total waste of money, and if there was a 0 star option this product would have it. If the box hadn't been lost it would be going back asap."
1,Oh Dear !!!,"Two of the worst stories in the history of TOS, but for different reasons. The 'Way to Eden' makes the mistake of trying to be trendy, and so dates badly. What the real problem is though is that it makes the Enterprise crew seem to be the disapproving establishment, especially of all people Captain Kirk. 'Requiem for Methuselah' is at heart a reasonable story with the assertion that one man could be responsible for the work of Da Vinci, Brahms and others. What it completely fails to do is have any appreciation for Kirk's relationships with women. Threre is no way any woman would have Kirk obsessed to the point he would fight for her, he is far to full of his own importance for that. This effectively trashes any credibility that the story would have had because this is the crux of the whole episode. A real pity."
1,Keep an open mind?,"1. Snow is My Downfall2. Tennessee Waltz3. Someone I LoveOne of these songs had a kazoo solo... a joke right? NOPE. The song was pretty good up to that point. I think the Tennesse Waltz was pretty good. The title song... strange. I love Patti Rothberg but this was not one of her best. I felt like she was playing a joke, which would be like Patti to do."
1,"""Keen"" disappointment","I love Keen shoes, but this style is useless. The elastic strap to hold it on your foot doesn't stay tight for more than a minute and anytime you change from sitting to standing to walking the strap loosens! Otherwise, the comfort is good and the style is cute, but since you can't walk in them, that's moot."
2,Lame and Dissapointing,"I've seen a great deal of these films and consider myself a buff. This selection is very weak! Most of the films are of the film strip variety, where there's music and there are still images that change, rather than the piece being a movie. Some of the films are unpardonably boring! There's so much great stuff out there, but not on this DVD. If you must see it, rent it."
5,10 Years Later and I Still Love It!,"My title is correct, I've had this book for 10 years-- I received it as a gift from my father when I was 9 and even now I'll look back on it for more than childish nostalgia. It's truly a gorgeous book.You can read the story of The Little Mermaid 100 times, but there's nothing like skimming the pages of this book and awing at the illustrations. There is nothing bad I can say about this book...If you don't have it, get it now!"
3,Not strong enough,"One packet is only good for 6 cups, not a full pot as the directions state. If you put in any more water, the coffe is too weak."
4,Andre Previn - The Kindness of Strangers,"As I am a fan of Andre Previn and have never seen him in action outside of the arena I found this film to be quite interesting. It brings to the audience more insight on the man himself. If you are an Andre Previn fan I would highly recommend it. However, through this bio I thought that it focused a little more than what I would like on the ""Streetcar Named Desire"" play that he had been working on. Briefly boring in this respect."
5,"Ah - Pacific Vortex, dare I say Alpha and Omega ?","I need to read that one a couple more times, but I'm glad I finally laid my hands on it. Readers of the whole series will appreciate this page of Dirk's past, on more than one account.Wait - did I break any secret ? Nah, I hope I inticed you to read it - if you're interested in Dirk's adventures, that is..."
4,Great start to an awesome series,This is the second book Ive read of Cusslers. Im a new fan. These books are so good I cant put them down. This was a quick one and only took me a few days to read.
2,Pacific Vortex Clive Cussler,I am a Fan of Clve Cussler.Dick Pit Engagements are fantastic.Those books are from start untill finish excellentstories.I think I have read most of Clive Cussler#s books Its thrilling experience.
4,"Good, but not Cussler best, and not as good as Inca Gold","I thought the book was good, but Inca Gold is the best so far. The ending was sort of incomplete and left you hanging. All in all Dirk Pitt was invincible as usual, but not as challenged in Pacific Vortex as he was in Inca Gold."
4,Pacific Vortex,I am a Cussler fan and enjoyed reading this book. I would highly recommend it to others.
1,I would have rated it 0 but....,"Is the book fast paced? Yes! But it beats everything hands down to take the ""worst-ever"" title. Its the most impossible book I have ever read. The circumstances so beautifully thought of by the author are so unrealistic that I would rather believe Harry Potter series were facts.Tha character Dirk Pitt could have killed a man 20 Miles off with a crossbow and arrow if the author wanted. He could fly a copter, swim through torrid currents, he could shoot, he could be funny, he could be serious. What he couldn't be was be more convincing. He might as well have taken an aim and shot towards the sky and would still have caught God on his bum.I am happy with my Forsythe, Ludlum, Grisham and even Rowling. You sure as hell cant make me read Cussler even if you gave me money to do it.Alavide!"
4,Fast Read,This was the first of many Cussler books. It was such an easy read I was unable to put the book down. I have made a habbit of setting time aside for his books. His best to date is Atlantis Found!!!
3,"Initailly facinating, ultimately too subjective","Initailly facinating, with comprehensive maps and history of the area.Unfortunately,The Enigma of Borley Rectory soon loses credibility through the authors extremely subjective and credulous approach.No theory is too far fetched for the writer to buy into and the plethora of "" perhaps"" & "" maybes"" soon palls.Nevertheless, a fun read if taken with a mightydash of salt !I shall be heading out to Borley to check out the ghostly happenings forthwith"
4,Last one in stock,"I just loved this fixture, and there was only one in stock, its a bit smaller than I wanted but I need one more, would love to know when there would be more in stock."
4,All that Joplin wanted was for it to be recognised,"Throughout Joplin's short 49 year long life, all he wanted to do was put forward the seriousness of ragtime, such an effect was achieved in his great ragtime opera ""Treemonisha"", but it was never recognised during his lifetime. With the re-emergence of ragtime in the 1970's Joplin's music and its sometimes elusive melancholic power came through, inspiring this great recording. Carmen Balthrop and Betty Allen are superb, and the recording from the orchestra is first class. Joplin's goal on writing this opera was to mix ragtime with opera to show that it could be just as ""serious"" as others. It is fair to say that Joplin's attempt, as a ragtime writer and not an opera writer is impressive and admirable, just as noone would expect an opera master like Puccini or Verdi to write ragtime."
2,Disappointment,"I bought volumne 3 to learn a few new positions and share with my wife. While the intro was interesting and the ""professionals"" offered instructional demonstrations, a young couple that was presented as ""viewers of the video"" really reduced the value of the lessons. Not only were they useless, it was obvious they weren't really participating but really stole from any romantic mood."
5,Morning saver,"When storms here on Lake Erie, winter and summer, knock off the power lines it is nice to still be able to make the morning coffee."
1,Poor main character's wife,"This will be my last Terri Blackstock book. The characters are flat; we are told by the author what they are thinking and feeling but it is not represented by actions. The wife of the main character is unforgiving, not in the least Christian, yet we are told she is. There is no charity, no kindness, in her. While the plot is only faintly realistic, the surrounding characters in law enforcement jump to conclusions not supported by facts and then act upon those conclusions in totally incorrect fashion. This book was not worth the zero I paid for it."
3,Basically good but...,"This is my first book by Terri Blackstone and I am only half way through the book, it does have a good story; however I am a little bit irriated by the main character's wife (Allie), for a Christian she's not very forgiving, always complaining about something and not really giving her husband a chance. During my reading I find myself making comments about her and wishing she was just a little nicer. But I will try to finish the book in a positive way :-)"
5,"EXCITEMENT,SUSPENSE,INTRIGUE","Right from the onset this is a gripping novel full of suspense and intrigue. Set around a small town in US the author introduces us to the characters that make up this close-knit community. The events that take place affect the whole town and as the murderer is sought after, friends pull together. Fingers are also pointed, however, but are they pointing in the right direction? A book you will be unable to put down until the last page is turned."
1,"stupid, stupid, stupid book","Reading this book feels like being drawn into a cult's cave. Every second paragraph, or there abouts, refers to faith, religion, god. Women are getting killed and firefighters are having breakdowns over their religion. Puhleeze! To make matters worse, everything from the brutal to the emotional is poorly crafted and sloppily described - it all reads like the work of an adolescent with too little life experience to talk of love, life, death, and relationships. Terrible book, stupid book, a never-buy-anything-by-this-author-again book."
2,Not for 1/8 inch thick glass,"I ordered this because it was I need one ASAP and didnt think it was necessary to pay $20 for one of these silly things. I got it to work on my 1/8 inch thick glass lid but its not made for that thickness. It has two rows of ""ribs"" running through it which make it impossible to squeeze it on 1/8 inch glass. I didnt have time to return it so I sliced the ribs out with a razor blade and got it to fit snuggly on the glass that way. Its for a smaller thickness of glass."
3,You'll need a razor blade,"Had I read the reviews more carefully I probably wouldn't have ordered this. But I'm glad I did read them before I tossed the hinge out. My glass is 1/8"" thick and there was no way in the world this was going on. When I went back online to find another one to order I did read the reviews and decided to try cutting the ridges out--nothing to lose. I used a razor blade cutting tool and cut off the two ridges on only one side of each half of the hinge. It was a snug fit, but I got the hinge attached without too much difficulty. I could have cut off the other side but I was afraid it might be too loose. I wonder if the ridges are supposed to be softer and more flexible, but whoever is manufacturing them is making the ridges very ""rigid"" instead."
2,Wrong edition sent,"The picture on the posting suggested that I would be sent the fourth edition of this text. Nowhere else did it mention the edition, but because the picture was of the fourth edition, I didn't expect the third edition to arrive instead. I returned the item, and was extremely impressed with Amazon's handling of my return. I ended up buying the fourth edition from a bookstore near my university."
5,A Timeless Book on Adult Education,"Eduard Lindeman, author of The Meaning of Adult Education, has written a timeless book on adult education. The book was originally published in 1926 but could have been written today in our present insurgence of placing higher priority on adult education. The content and context are both relevant to what we're still researching in regard to how adult students learn differently than tradional age students.Lindeman has captured the meaning of adult education and given us words of wisdom to use as we continue to strive towards understanding adult students in relation to their learning process, their environment and their success in the classroom."
1,Tinny and unmelodic Caribbean Music,"This album *may* be a fine exploration of Caribbean Island music. If you want an hour of fond memories for ""Fantasy Island"" then go ahead and buy it. However, having listened to it once, I am looking for someone to give it to...It is tinny, unmelodic and musically confused. Disco? Caribbean? New Age? The artists can't make up their minds. If you are looking for something in the tradition of Enigma, Loop Guru or other progressive/world-music blends then pass this one by..."
2,What am I missing?,"My faucet doesn't have a knob on top, and seems pretty standard to me, but this thing will not stay on. It's cute, but I'm sorry I wasted the $$."
1,Hard Plastic and doesn't work if spout has knob on top,This spout protector is made of a hard plastic so it isn't much safer than the metal spout. If you spout has a pull knob on the top to send the water to the shower head then this turtle won't fit over your spout making it useless. I wish they would have disclosed this in the information section. I ended up buying an air filled protector.
5,Better than Expected.,I loved to read about the Suprem Court because they are The Supremes and better than their musical counterparts to listen to.
4,Landscapes,Another Wm. Powell book for my granddaughter. Again his instruction is clear and very easy to follow. She is teaching herself to draw and this is helping her improve her skills.
5,best bibical book for kids,i have a seven and ten year old that read to each other every night they love it
2,Poor paper quality,"I'm very disappointed by the quality of the paper in the book. Except for the book cover, the entire book is printed on poor quality paper without any color."
2,Bible stories stripped to the bone and dried,"Low quality paper and line drawings aside, there is something a little too ""stripped down"" about this book. The stories are told so briefly and matter of factly, and so much 'feel' is left out that the Old Testament comes off being a story about a brutal, arbitrary God ruling over a bunch of primitive tribes. The New Testament loses all sense of poetry and myth. I read it to my daughter when she was seven and her reaction was... ""why is God so mean?"""
5,loved it,"With twin 4 year old girls, I have vast experience with little houses, castles, etc... This toy far exceeds most of them out there, including many disney products and barbie castles. The pieces are small, yet manageable and sturdy. There are enough ""tricks"" (working light, mailbox, etc..) to keep it interesting, yet not so many that it is too much for a preschooler. The miniature little ponies are adorable and fun to play with. I was impressed with the product considering the affordable price ($22 and it came with an extra free pony). I have paid $20 already for a barbie castle that only comes with tiny thin miniature plastic pieces (that always get lost) and thin, cheap plastic structures that do nothing (no lights, etc..) This product is well worth it!"
5,Larger than I expected,"After reading the other reviews, I decided to get a large rather than a medium. I tend to wear anywhere from a size 8 to a 12, depending upon the item. When I received these, I loved them, but they are not tight enough to be considered compression tights at all. I kept them rather than returning, because they are still useful for cold weather running, and they are very comfortable, well-made and otherwise very nice. I also did not have a problem with the ankle elastic as some other reviewers mentioned. I'm writing this review in case there are other people trying to decide about which size to get- I wish I had gotten them a bit smaller. If you're between sizes, size down!"
1,Product is not great & the company made a sizing mistake!,"Product is meant to be compression tights but it is a bit loose. I'm 5'8 and of average built and it is loose from the hips down. I ordered two of different sizes, one for my friend and the company sent two of the same size. When I contacted them requesting for a change as they were the one who made the mistake, they told me I have to bear the cost of the shipment as I live outside US. I emailed them several times but they refused to bear the cost. I am very disappointed as that was my very first online purchase from Amazon. I have expected US companies to have excellent customer service but apparently, this is not so. Disappointing experience."
5,Tintin is sooo wonderful,"I love Tintin, and I would reccomend that you buy this book. It is the last three books in the Tintin seiries. If you are a Tintin maniac like me, then you would definately buy this. Even if you aren't a maniac, I would still reccomend it. Tintin in the Picaros is very good, and Flight 714 is verry funny. Even though they say Tintin is a reporter-slueth, I think he is more like a detective because he always has a gun. This book is soooo good. It won't take that long to read all three adventures, but you can always read them again. GO TINTIN!"
5,Kathleen Battle - Bel Canto Arias,"Kathleen Battle - Bel Canto Arias is a 1993 Deutsche Grammophon recording starring Kathleen Battle as she sings Bellini, Rossini and Donizetti. The booklet contains music notes and all the lyrics. Ms. Battle sings with great feeling and she truly understands the nature of the music of these Italian composers. Truly a joy to listen to this fine recording. Highly recommended. 5/5."
4,Very nice,"The Dream Essentials Escape sleep mask works great at blocking out the light. It is a little lighter than I expected, judging by the picture and some of the reviews, but still a little heavier than I like, so I was worried it would really heat up my face while I slept and grow uncomfortable. It doesn't much though, and is quite comfortable. I didn't have any trouble sleeping on my side with it on, but my brother-in-law always says I have a big head, so maybe that's why. :PThe earplugs that come with it are nothing but the foam earplugs you can get anywhere, but I wasn't buying for those, so I don't really care."
4,Mostly comfortable,"This is my second sleep mask from Dream Essentials. I originally had the ""Sweet Dreams"" model, which I really liked, but figured I would try different one. I think that this mask is well made and probably better at blocking out ALL the light, however, I am side sleeper. I don't mind wearing this when sleeping on my side, but it is not as comfortable as the ""Sweet Dreams"", which is more flexible."
1,Jut as useless as I feared,"I had heard decent word-of-mouth reviews of this blindfold and decided to risk it despite the fact that the eye cups made it look horribly uncomfortable. I should have listened to my instincts.The top half of my face is blazing hot with it on. The cups that are supposed to prevent direct contact with the eye cut into the eye sockets themselves and are too rigid to flex with the natural movements of the head, essentially making side or stomach sleeping impossible without constant pressure on the sides of the face. Worse, the velcro strap does not attach at the back of the head like a baseball cap, but rather closer to the right ear, which results in a scratching sensation and a necessary adjustment.If you're a back sleeper, this is perfect, but it was clearly NOT designed for use in unique sleeping positions. Very disappointing."
2,Best sleep mask except...,I love this mask except for the fact that the color bleeds everywhere. I've tried washing the mask which helped but did not solve the problem. I would buy a color other than blue but the only lighter color is pink so no sale.
2,Does not work,"Ordered a black one for myself and this pink one for the wifey. The pink one simple does not work well. The black is not much better either, however the pink color makes it worse b/c it is so light. There is definite light leakage that comes from the bottom, particularly around the nose area. Just not made that well. They should have tested this product first."
1,Terrible eye mask,"I was looking for a complete light blocking eye mask and bought this after doing some research. The mask is unbreathable, bulky, and worst of all, the velcro straps cut into my ears in the night and continually woke me up from the pain. This mask should only be used for back sleepers, not side sleepers. Bulkiness does not transition well to any movement in sleep."
1,insulting to the African people...,"As someone who was born in Africa and went on to be educated in the United States, I find his depiction of the African people to be offensive. I also do not think much of his poor writing talent. Thumbs down."
3,Jordan got what he deserved,"All in all, this was a somewhat decent book. Jordan Rutldge, in my opinion, was nothing more than a child molester and rapist. I sure hope that other Peace Corps volunteers are not like him!!In the end, Jordan got what he deserved!"
2,not as cute in reality and run too big,"Run about a half to one size bigger so order down. The toe is not a round and cute as it appears in the picture. It has more oblong elongated shape. I ordered the dark leather. It seems pretty stiff. However the sole is fairly well cushioned and made out of flexible rubber so over all comfort looks OK. Mainly, I returned them because they were just too big."
4,Well played sound,"Our bagpipe band used these for matched pads, and the drum corps enjoyed the sound and ""playability"" of these pads. There are some additional mylar sheets/covers that can be placed on them to vary the feel and sound.The only real draw-backs are the weight (they are not light!), and the rough-finished edge of the base material (wafer board)."
5,Positive and inspirational. It change my thought patterns.,"This book transformed my belief system--how I view the world, people, and myself. After reading this book, I really began to realize that I am the captain of my own fate; that I determine my own destiny just by the manner in which I think. Highly recommend this book to those who want to feel and see a positive change in their life."
4,"His first offering, and it has made me come back for more...",Excellent musical addition to the Christian family of artists. His music is powerful and solid. His lyrics and voice are unmistakable and touching. Amazing talent.
4,Definitely worth Watching.,"After reading some of the other reviews on this film, I felt that I had to throw in my two cents. Overall I feel that the movie was very well done. This was not a documentary, I wouldn't expect all of the scenes to be ""factually correct"". Yes, I know that others suffered from Nazi oppression, however this is an heroic tale, and I feel that the spirt of the Ghetto uprising was well portrayed here. Having read two novels, and one factual account of the uprising, I think for the most part they got it right. My only objection was the scene in the Catholic church on Easter Sunday. There was no need for it, and I thought it detracted from the spirit of the film. Were the filmmakers trying to infer anti-semitism from the Catholic Church? Ah well, other than that, I loved it. This is, unfortunately, a little known historical event. Anything that sheds light on the heroism of these people in standing up to evil, and impossible odds, is okay in my book."
3,"Okay plot, engaging, but lacking in quality of acting","I found my reaction to this movie to be mixed. The fake accents were problematic for me, and some of the actors ought to stick to sitcoms. However, I believe it was an important story to be told, and regardless of its actual historical merrit, interesting. It certainly engaged me for the time period where I was viewing it, the scenery was excellent. I certainly became interested in the actual historical facts after watching it. I think it is a movie worth watching."
2,Should have listened to other reviews,"This item is VERY heavy. If you are purchasing it, and are not a strong man, you could not sit wearing this.Also, another review stated the beads all graviated to the bottom because it is not stitched around the corners. By darn this is totally true. So, you put it on, and all the beads go to the very bottom leaving the rest empty. This could be totally avoided it they would just stitch the beads in small closed squares. Also, you will need a large microwave, and you will need to move it around a few times on high to get it all heated. It took me about 8 mins total in a 1000 watt medium sized microwave. To get most of the beads warmed.I already own one of this company's products I bought over 12 years ago, and have NO problems with the old item. So, I jumped to purchase this, due to the great quality of the old one I have. BIG mistake..I do not recommend until they fix the problems."
5,This herbal vest has it all!!,"The Herbal Concepts Vest (Lavender) is divine! It's heavy in a comforting way, and can be worn on the front or back. I can apply heat to my shoulders, back, neck, or any other part of my body where I want some heat. It heats up beautifully in the microwave, and has become my ""security blanket"" for nights when I just want to feel cozy and pampered. The lavender scent is as soothing as the heat. Would highly recommend this product!"
1,Unbeliavably HEAVY.....and you must have large microwave,My problem is shoulder biceps inflammation. I was not able to carry this huge & heavy pad to place on shoulder. I have to ask someone for help. Another problem is microwave. This pad is very very heavy and cumbersome so that carousel did not turn.....and needed more than 3 minutes to get fully heated.I throw it away and bought electric heating pad.
4,"informationally good, a bit confusing at times","this book is full of good information, particularly if you don't know much about xml but know a lot about html. the first 10 chapters are great, particularly the sections on the document type definition (dtd) -- you can see where the W3C defines html and how much of that definition is missing or added to by the different browsers. unfortunately, the book is not laid out very well. there are a lot of references to later chapters that leave you wondering what they are talking about until you get there. this book is written by two different people, and it seems obvious who wrote what chapters. i give 4 stars, not 3, because there is enough useful information in this book to make it worth reading and having for the html expert looking to make the move towards xml."
2,Did not include springboard chapter,"I think this is a well done book and it is useful. However, the reason I ordered it was for the bonus chapter about the springboard and the book I received did not have this chapter in it. The information about the book did and still does indicate that this chapter is in the book. I was very disappointed."
3,Good for the Time Warp...,"Though not the best Casper music compilation, this gets a 3 for having the guts to put a version of ""Time Warp"" on a kids album...Otherwise, beware..."
3,Pretty bleak.,"I doubt the author is actually in accord with some of the statements and ideas in this book. He seems to be using a lot of hyperbole to me. But in any case, if you read this book you should also read Hero with a Thousand Faces by Campbell. You will feel better and have something else to help decide which world view is best."
1,Yawn,Who really cares. Put this one day after a laborious try 1/3rd into it. Maybe it was a bad translation.
4,Jarring and Ambitious,"The shock of the book's subject matter and graphic content is heightened by the matter-of-fact tone, which is reminiscent of a fairy tale. One cannot fault Houellebecq's ambition -- were I to choose a single work of fiction with which to introduce a Rip Van Winkle to the major social and philosophical themes of the last 40 years, this would be a good choice. This is not a happy read, but an important one. I agree with the assessment that Houellebecq places himself at the level of Camus with this work."
3,OK Bruce...,"Not a great CD, not a bad CD...but worth it for the killer version of ""Thunder Road."" As a Jersey Guy, I was never a fan of Bruce without the E Street Band, but this one track makes it all worthwhile."
2,MTV Plugged?,"I'm a big fan of ""The Boss"", but for the life of me, can't fathom why he is unable to follow the lead of larger acts, and actually ""unplug"" for MTV Unplugged. This CD offers no new material that can't be found elsewhere, and is basically nothing more than a ""live in concert"" CD that just so happened to be filmed by MTV.This concert took place in 1992, and you know it's pretty bad when you have bands ribbing you three years later about going on MTV UNPlugged, and then having to go and plug in. It's not like Bruce doesn't know how to play acoustic guitar, because he does. I'm a big acoustic guitar fan, and for someone of Bruce's talent level, to not be able to write songs that can be played acoustically only serves to bring down the level of respect I have for his talent.Not what I would consider an essential recording, and not recommended, unless you are such a die-hard ""Boss"" fan that you have to own every album he puts out. Otherwise, save your money."
4,Bruce Live Minus the E Street Band,"This is the cd version of the MTV Plugged show Bruce did back in 1992 with the band he assembled to tour with him on his Human Touch/Lucky Town tour. Unfortunately, the shows from this tour are always compared to those with the E Street Band and they, of course, fall short. That being said, there are some good performances on this disk. Bruce knew what were the best songs from those two disks were and they appear here. The performances of ""Lucky Town"", ""Living Proof"", ""I Wish I Were Blind"" & ""Better Days"" are all solid and among his older songs ""Atlantic City"" stands out. The performance of ""Light Of Day"" has a tremendous amount of energy and there is some excellent guitar interplay on it. All in all, it's not the pinnacle of Bruce's career, but still fun to listen to."
4,Thunder Road,"That song alone is worth the purchase. Listening to this arrangement makes my hairs stand on end....the rest of the album ain't bad either, but that one song just makes my day. Darkness on the Edge of Town is another nice listen too."
1,Terrible,"This is the most poorly thought out, poorly written book I have ever read. I'm not just talking about metaphysical books either. The authors thoughts are poorly constructed and Scattered. This reads more like the diary entries of a mental patient than a book. I wouldn't have put my real name on this either. I can only hope this book was written for the sole purpose of making money."
2,I can't believe how PREDICTABLE Will Smith has become!,"Let me say it now, I was totally looking forward to this album. I had bought it AFTER Smith made videos for his songz. I thought this was a masterpiece CD. Let me break the cd down, 4 Songs are good, There are 4 ""spam"" or skit-like tracks, and 8 songs that range from horrible to mediocre at best. I was truly let down. Will Smith's career is in deep jeopardy. He is TOO mainstream. 4 songs that were good were Gettin Jiggy Wit it, Just the Two of us, Men In Black, and Miami. However, without music videos, this cd would have gotten 1 star. Now, if you are a girl, you might like this album, if you are a guy, you will most likely despise Will Smith after this CD. Smith's ""I keep my music clean"" persona is lame, dead, and pathetic. His music is for kids for crying out loud. Essentially, this album marks a low point in his career."
1,terrible,"I bought this cd after everybody told me it was good when i got it, it was terrible if you like cool sounding rap like I do, dont get this cd it is a big waste of money i will promise you one thing if you get this cd you will wanna smash it! Will Smith put hardly any work in it he just made this cd to make money TRUST ME!"
3,damn,"i cant believe camp lo did a song with the fresh prince. the beats are funky but will aint sayin sh*t lyric wise.get that camp lo joint tho, every song they ever did is indispensable"
3,"Try to get the singles for ""Jiggy"" and ""Miami"" instead","Although I prefer Will Smith's songs from his ""Fresh Prince"" days, there still are a few gems on Big Willie Style. You might be better off buying the two singles for ""Gettin' Jiggy"" and ""Miami"" instead of investing in buying this whole album."
3,Stick with the singles,"Unless you're twelve, this CD will prove quite unsatisfying, even (especially) if you couldn't get ""Men in Black"" or ""Gettin' Jiggy Wit it"" out of your head. The rest of it seems inane. Save your money and buy the singles."
5,The Best Artist - He is so ILL !!!!!,I think Willl Smith is the Illist artist. He has the best music I never get board of it and I listen to every day since I bought it over two years ago. I love every one of his songs. I LOVE WILL SMITH HE IS SO ILLLLLLLLLLL YEAH !!!!!!!!
2,"Unoriginal, too commercial","If you think Will Smith is true rap, you better go out to the rap section and pick up something else. His beats are unoriginal, all of his songs are to commercial, have no edge and lack the realness of most other rappers (cept Puffy, but I won't start on that). All of his songs are almost exactly the same, and the lyrics in them suck. Basically, people impressed by glitz and stuff will like it. Real rap fans won't."
5,The Best!!,"This CD is worth your money. All the songs are great espacially "" Just the 2 of us"" Will, keep on fulfilling your dreams in movies and music for many more years to come. Rock on Will!!!!!!"
2,Tastes like ... gumdrops!,"Fresh Prince, oh Fresh Prince!. Where art thou Fresh Prince?Let me say this; Will Smith can rap. No, let me rephrase that. Will Smith can utter words that rhyme while staying on beat. But this doesn't quite qualify as hip hop. But Will Smith has found his voice, and his audience, and I can't blame him for that. Besides, I did kinda like ""Miami"" and ""Jiggy Wit it."" Kinda."
3,A mixed bag........,"Overall, I have to say that I like this album, despite it's bad points. First of all, I have to admit that this is really not my kind of rap. Most of it seems a little.....well, light. But that's not an entirely bad thing---it's kind of a refreshing break from a lot of what's out there. Still, it can be bit weak at times. I don 't know why he included ""Men in Black,"" either. It's a rather mediocre song to begin with, and it really doesn't fit on this album. There's plenty to redeem Big Willie Style, however. The highlights are Gettin' Jiggy Wit It (one of those songs that gets stuck in your head for the rest of the day once you listen to it), I Loved You, Just the Two of Us, and Don't Say Nothing. It's not one of the greastest albums in it's genre, but it's more than worth your money."
3,Not that good.Though not that bad either!,"After hearing Gettin' Jiggy With It,Miami,Just The Two Of Us and Men In Black,I decided to get this.As soon as I got it home I played these 4 tracks first,but then I listened to some of the other tracks and they were a little disappointing.I was tempted to give this 2 stars but gave it a 3 because Will Smith is a great guy.Still,I suggest you try this CD first."
2,BuY ThE SiNgLeS PeOpLe,"Okay, so the songs r just remakes of old so called songs. I don't really care. The only good one is ""Miami"" and maybe ""Gitten' jiggy wit it"". But the rest is junk and has to go. Unless you want to hear some messed up songs sayin' how great Will is.....BUY THE SINGLES!There's to many stupid ""songs"". The cd is too expensive to buy only for a couple of old hits. Overall he's a good actor but come on he's no mc. This is a cd only that lil' kids should buy that can't hear ""naughty"" language."
2,Commercial,"I personally don't like this CD. As a rapper, Will just can't compete with most of the other acts out there. He's got an OK flow and all, but it's the kind of thing I'd expect from the backstreet boys if they were rappers. A real rap CD would be MC Ren's ""Villain in Black"". But if you take this as the commercial pop rap it is, then it's really not that bad."
3,some of it was ok,"I loved ""Gettin Jiggy with it"", ""Miami"", ""Just the Two of Us"", and ""Men in Black"", but the rest of it just didn't appeal to me at all! In short, it's not a CD that I would listen to every chance I got. My advice is to buy the singles of the good songs. The rest of it isn't worth it."
2,Can't get the Engine to light up or run!,Good morning...A friend is helping me set up the train on the track. The cars light up EXCEPT for the engine. I lost the initial instructions. IS THERE AN ON/OFF SWITCH ON any of the cars? What are we doing wrong?
5,A must have!,This is one of those series any anime fan NEEDS to have in their collection. The story stays relatively alligned with the original manga-version and the quality is without question.
4,A kick @$$ metal album,"First half of the album is awesome, but i'm not a big fan of the album's last few tracks. But they're still an amazing band: they should have supported Iron Maiden on their Dance of Death UK tour, instead of Funeral for a f****** Friend!"
3,NOT HELLOWEENS BEST,"NOT THEIR BEST EFFORT, I EXPECTED MORE. GRAPOW IS MISSED. HOPEFULLY THEY GO BACK TO A HARDER, DARKER MORE AGGRESIVE STYLE , AS THE DARK RIDE IS A MUCH BETTER ALBUM"
4,back on board,"The only other Helloween CDs that I own are the Keeper of the Seven Keys Pt. 1 and 2. I had heard other stuff, but not really gotten into it. For some reason I heard this one and it was catchy and memorable. I was probably in the mood for some power metal to mix in with all the death and thrash metal. This is a good cd."
4,Solid but not great.,"This cd is on average a very solid disc from the boys from Hamburg. It is much better than ""the Dark Ride"" but not great like ""Better than Raw"" much less the ""keepers"". I hate to disagree with other reviewers because everything is a matter of opinions but ""Nothing to say"" (with reggae) is a bonus track at most. To me ""just a little sign"" and ""The Tune"" are too ""happy"" a la ""All over the Nations"". There are solid tracks like ""Open your life"" and ""Dou you feel good"" and a standout is ""Back against the Wall"". Markus chips in the two heaviest tracks ""Hell was made in heaven"" and ""liar liar"". And a Gerstner track I really liked is ""Sun 4 the World"". All in all ""Rabbit"" is a good solid album with no spectacular tracks. ""Open.."" and ""Do you..."" will be good live tracks if inserted in set lists. Also this CD Growed on me because at first listen I was really dissapointed so I waited to write this review. ENJOY."
3,Get the DVD,There's an excellent little film from which these songs come (including a very young Tim Roth). The songs are fine but they need the context. The film's about a jaded commuter travelling from Guildford to London Waterloo (get it!). The songs are performed Dennis Potter style en-route on the train.
5,"Hilarious, scary, informative","Yes, censorship is alive, even in the Land of the Free. Perrin's terrific book is essentially a history of censorship in the UK and US. In the US, the censorship appears primarily as ""bowdlerization"" in which the rougher edges of a written work are edited out to avoid offending sensitive readers or arousing witch hunters.The ""Dr. Bowdler"" of the title refers to the guiding light of a printed version of Shakespeare that was popular in the US in the 19th century. Bowdler and family produced this edited version for ""family"" consumption, since ""raw"" Shakespeare was deemed too raw for popular sensibilities, and for children in particular.For this paperback version, Perrin included an update to report on more recent events. The most incredible story had to do with Bradbury's famous anti-censorship SF novel ""Fahrenheit 451"" and how the complete edition was supplanted for a few years by a censored edition."
1,Magellqn hates their customers,"I got a Magellan Roadmate 360 product as a very nice gift 2 years ago, this Christmas the power port got wonky so I emailed Magellan for information on where to take it for repair. I got an email back saying they no longer support this ""older model"" and that the best I can do is to try to trade it in for a refurb at a price. I called Customer service to see what the deal was, and I was on hold/transferred/on hold etc....after 20 min I decided I have no wish to provide this company with any more of my money. I realize that technology changes swiftly, but this is a minor repair and the thing was over $500 and is only 2 years old. I can get a computer repaired after 2years. They Really dislike to have to deal with customers and I would recommend you not purchase any products due to complete lack of support/customer care!"
1,NO UPGRADES ON MAPS. GIVES BAD DIRECTIONS,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL. NEVER BUYING ANOTHER MAGELLAN AGAIN. PAID OVER 300.00 FOR THIS ONE AND COULD HAVE SPENT 200 LESS TO GIVE ME BAD DIRECTIONS. i WROTE TO MAGELLAN SEVERAL TIMES WITHOUT A RESPONSE. THIS PRODUCT SUCKS AND SO DOES THE COMPANY.
3,Finally a gps that does it both.,"I had been waiting for a unit that would assist me in finding addresses, giving me turn by turn directions and then be usable for geocaching. I thought this was the one. However, the two features are not so well integrated. Works like all others for navigating the roads. But if you want to navigate the roads to get close to a geocache and then find it offroads, you must program a POI for driving and then program a Waypoint to find it. Not easy if you want to set up about 10 or more of them. And then Magellan has its own format so you can't just download them from the internet into your box, you must hand enter. Might want to wait and see if Garman comes up with something. Oh, your current position icon is so big, that it gets in your way when your are trying to find stuff in a 10-12 ft radius. And the stinking ""approaching destination"" pop-up will screw ya up too, it clears the goto. If only we could hack the firmware and fix these things!"
4,good buy,"works well, used it both hiking and driving. Navigation instructions aren't perfect, but I know some shortcuts the computer doesn't."
4,It's all in the seller,"I love this GPS but Magellan service stinks. I got mine through Consumer Electronics Warehouse (CEW) and they know what they are doing. Turns out that Magellan doen't bother to answer service tags or return calls and doesn't seem to offer any support for the CrossoverGPS. I bought it for auto and cross country (hiking in Yellowstone, Glacer, etc.). The on-line and supplied manual don't match the unit BUT CEW told me how to go on-line and get an equivalent manual off the Magellan web site. They even sent me the link. CEW was on the problem with very personal attention to my needs (to quote the Montana govenor) like the stink on skunk. CEW you are my heros. Once I got a eal manual this litle thing is great. Sometimes it gets a little confused with road names but if you are planning a trip, this and Google get you there with no problems. Magellan, you amke a nice device, too bad you are such jerks. CEW, thank you again."
4,Can't imagine driving without it,"I recently started working in real estate so I figured I better get a GPS to help me navigate the city. Man, am I glad I did! Just enter an address and the Magellan will get you there. One neat feature is it shows a diagram of how to navigate upcoming 'devices' such as traffic circles, which we have a lot of here in Massachusetts. My only beef thus far is that it could do a better job of identifying cross streets as you drive."
3,Updates,There are no map updates for this product. There are many errors in the existing maps.You have to purchase the water navigation maps for an additional $200.00.
5,"Hilarious, Engrossing, Highly Enterntaining","I laughed out loud in many places in this very funny, fast paced book. I think this is her best book yet, and it is definitely worth a read."
2,Ho-hum,"I'm going against the tide here but at least its an honest opinion:- This one's a dud, folks.In book 5, the mystery gives way to the romance. In fact, it gives a whole lot of way! Female readers will enjoy this book but the discerning crime-fiction fan probably wont (no matter what their gender).If you already have the first four books and must have this one in your collection, then buy it. Its your money. But if you dont mind, then skip it. Its a dud. Unless of course if you enjoy reading romance novels pretending to be mystery novels.The two stars are for Grandma Mazur. Otherwise, I'd give it just one star."
3,A fun read,"I would recommend the whole series of Stephanie Plum books. They aren't literary masterpieces, but they are fun to read."
5,THIS BOOK IS PURE ENTERTAINMENT!!!,"I was one of the lucky ones to get my hands on an advanced copy and tore right into it. The plot and characters are more plausible than recent Stephanie Plum plots and is as good, if not better than, ""One for the money"". The only drawback is that I'll be disappointed when I see it on the bookstore shelves and realize I've already read it. If only Janet could crank 'm out faster......."
3,I just can't get into this one like I did w/the others.,"""High Five"" may be an OK read, but I can't seem to get into it. I'm almost halfway through it and it's not really holding my interest. And, Janet, if you read this, I think you should know: '53 Buicks do NOT have seatbelts or E-brakes that pull up!!!!! Stephanie is NOT driving a 'Vette!! Hopefully I will make it through this one."
4,addictive,Stephanie is like the girl next door with some extra excitement in her life.she's addictive! can't stop reading story after story.
1,"""High 5""? Marketing 101 - returning this book to Amazon.com","Deeply disappointing. Thoroughly enjoyed the first four in this series. Now Evanovich seems trapped in the Two Guys/One Narrator-Gal series problem. It's just to lure us through the series, while there is no plan or character development point.The book was mostly ""Stephanie Plum's Greatest Hits"". All the key things repeat from past books: funeral viewings, Stephanie's car woes, Grandma gets her hand on a weapon, junk food menu reviews, and waaaaaay too many plot threads. Ultimately leading to a big fake-out final three pages, begging: Read my next book, please!I won't. I'm returning this hardback copy to Amanzon.com. I might leave message at the author's webiste, and will definitely write the publisher. Very cheap ending ploy."
5,"Keep at it, Janet",I can only say that I wish I'd stumbled across Janet Evanovich when she was on the 100th Stephanie Plum novel--so that I could read her for the next year without stopping.I dig that chick. I laugh out loud. I wish it would never end.
1,NOT CRAZY ABOUT IT,"WELL THIS IS MY FIRST TIME READING A BOOK BY DONALD GOINES - I DONT THINK I WILL TRY ANOTHER ONE. I LIKE WHERE THE STORY WAS COMING FROM AND WHERE IT WAS GOING, BUT IT JUST DID NOT HOLD MY INTEREST. IT WENT FROM BORING TO CONFUSING TO MEANLESS IN EACH CHAPTER. I DONT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK - IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME, I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH READING IT."
5,CLASSIC,This was a great book. After reading this I wanted to go out and try some of things he wrote in the book to see if I could pull them off like he did.
1,Chewed Handle,I gave the Jolly Ball to my Golden Doodle (35 pound dog) and within 15 minutes he chewed off the handle. I was not a happy camper.
2,Good idea...,"Neither I nor my horse are sure what to do with it, but it is fun to kick around the field."
5,jolly balls,"My dogs, all rottweilers, loved the balls. They are really holding up considering all the use they have received. I plan on getting more if and when they wear out. They arrived very quickly, which was a plus."
5,Beautifully written,"This shows that true Marian devotion leads the soul to a closer relationship with Jesus. Mary leads us to Jesus and Jesus leads us to the Father, simply putting it. Wonderful book to prove to Protestants that praying and honoring Mary is not blasphemous."
5,Maturity not as interesting to audience as combativeness.,"I hope that, like many great albums, this one will eventually be discovered by the so-far oblivious public. ""Gospel Oak"" proves that O'Connor has gathered wisdom from her years as a mother and musician (in that order). From the start to its all-too-hasty finish, the songs swimmingly seduce one into a peaceful state in a manner much like the first half of Van Morrison's ""Veedon Fleece."" As always, O'Connor's unflinching honesty pervades, but now it is accompanied by a deeper compassion for all people. It's as close to divinely inspired as anything I've heard in a long time."
3,"Soothing, yet a little too slow","I found this tape to be disappointing, after reading the glowing reviews from other T'ai Chi enthusiasts. The stretches were really great, but the methodical way the instructors progressed through the form bored me quickly. Starting over from the beginning after each new move got very old, very fast. I found that I learned the first few steps of the form very easily, but the later steps weren't as thoroughly explained, so I wondered whether I was doing them correctly. Perhaps a better way of explaining it would have been to teach the first few steps of the form, then the next few steps, then put those together, then learn the last few steps, then put the whole thing together. In any case, I may use this tape; at least the first part with the stretches and the demonstration of the form; for a way to unwind at the end of a busy day, but I doubt I'll do the whole tape again any time soon."
5,Great behind the scenes (Kevin Kelly is a hermafodite!?),great dvd cool behind the scenes good extras up to 3 hours very impressed BUT I WAS SHOCKED to find out that kevin kelly really is a hermafodite the rock says it on the dvd not like a promo but he he admits wanting to look for some proof 5 stars
2,PLeeeease!,"Come on gang, why waste your hard earned money on a piece of gagbage like this? I can turn on the TV and see all the WWF I want and it doesn't cost me a single dime."
3,Kinda weak.,"I am a big X-men fan but the writing was kind of weak. I read it all in one sitting and when I was finished, I was asking myself where the rest of the story was. Sorry, Marvel, you struck out."
5,Love baking? Get this cookbook!,"As someone who loves to bake, I've come to adore this cookbook. Ms. Heatter's easy to follow directions make it easy to achieve great results on recipes that can seem a bit daunting at first. She not only has great cake recipes, she also has recipes for glaceed strawberries (these are to die for!), ice cream sauces, cookies, brownies and much more. Anytime I want to bake something that will impress, this is the first book I pick up."
3,"Nice idea, but I like Greatest Hits better","Nice idea that Geffen Records would release its own collection of Bobby Brown, but I like the 14-song CD that MCA released in 2000 better. It has his more definitive and funkier songs. And it's longer, 63 minutes. This one has a lot of songs from Don't Be Cruel, but he did more songs after that high creative peak he had in 1988 and 1989. Good attempt, but this is too much of an attempt to one up over the longer compilation albums by Bobby and New Edition on the market."
3,Terrible Recording of the Glass,"I can't imagine a worse recording of the Glass. The orchestra, the sound engineers, or both simply did not care. How else does one explain the underheated, tinny performance?I'm still working on the Schnittke."
2,OK - once I fixed it but look elsewhere unless you're mechanically capable,"Bought this for a golfer friend - but no golf balls included but that was expected. What was an issue was installing the balls before I gave it to him. First, there was 'part' of a peg already in the middle hole so no ball could be installed there. Poor workmanship or quality or whatever. Had to drill it out in order to make it work. Secondly the 'trick' part of the puzzle was screwed on too tight and would not move - there was no way the pin was sliding on the 'third' peg (and I know the trick - that was not the issue). Fixed with a screwdriverand 'redrilled' - the puzzle works fine and I can now present it to my friend. I would NOT recommend this puzzle unless you are comfortable rebuilding it. Don't waste your money - look elsewhere."
2,Hallelujah!,I was hoping for the long version of Hallelujah and did not get it. Leonard Cohn's voice has not aged well.
2,Time to hang it up,"After being stunned by the genious in Cohens first greatest hits, I had to pick this one up to see what other greats he had out there. Big mistake. This music has no structure and no raw emotion like his older works. Even the lyrics are pretty tame compared to earlier work. Obviously musicians change over the years but this sounds like something you would hear down at an Atlantic City lounge, but with a terribly weak singer. Having a band is a waste of time, most of this music sounds like it could have been generated by a cheesy synth.I will continue to hunt down the old greats but this is just Elvis later years wish wash with nothing thought provoking except what happened over the years."
3,Her worst work,"IF you want good BoA music(and she has plenty), look for her Japanese singles and her 2nd Korean album... Don't get this CD. It's just not as good as singles like Listen to My Heart and Valenti."
4,Excellent stuff.,"I really enjoyed this album. It was the first Rainer Maria album I've listened to, and it definitely inspired me to go back and pick up the rest of their catalog. The only real weaknesses are tracks 4 and 7, which flag a bit compared to the rest of the relatively up-beat music on the album. The first track, Artificial Light, is a perfect neoLuddite anthem, and tracks 3 and 8, Ceremony and Spit & Fire, respectively, are excellent as well. Recommended."
2,"Okay, but not great...","Unfortunately, none of the images show the inside of the waistband which is exposed elastic (as opposed to the similar product by Russell) which I found irritating and uncomfortable... enough so that I ordered theRussell Athletic Men's Cotton Performance Baseline Shortwhich was larger (despite the same size labeling), longer, had pockets, and is more comfortable to wear.The Champion shorts are fine, serviceable, and quite adequate... just not as good as the Russells."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought 5 pair of these because they looked like the longer knee length I wanted but turned out to be only mid thigh on a young man who's 5'9"". Even though they're made of jersey knit, they're rougher than others I'd bought of the same material. For those 2 reasons, my son won't wear them. It's not worth the expense of returning them so they sit unused in a box in his closet. I'll probably just donate them to charity."
4,Interesting and Informative,"The renowned Daniel Boulud has provided us with a useful distillation of his knowledge of working in the food service industry. From getting started to working your way up, Daniel explains the basics of what you need to do to succeed in the fast-paced adrenaline-charged world of the commercial kitchen. Even if you're not interested in becoming a chef or a restaurateur, much of the information provided can be useful in your home kitchen. If you are interested in a career in cooking, this a must-read. Like Anthony Bourdain, Daniel doesn't hide or candy-coat the less pleasant aspects of the business. He lays it all out for you, rewards and sacrifices."
1,disappointing,"I was hoping for more magic frankly, and he didn't deliver. Everything he talks about is pretty obvious already, not enlightening in the least. In fact, I found it offensive when he warned older people to not even get involved in the profession. I get his point but....Sorry, Daniel, if you have the passion, it doesn't matter..............?What kind of inspiration is this, to discourage those not in their twenties? He's a pompous ass."
5,LEFT/RIGHT-Gotta dig it!!,"Oh yes, I gotta give it to these boys, these men, these masters of skill, the Wolfe brothers!!! Same as the main character in LEFT/RIGHT, I was 30 years old once. Just a couple months ago. *I* however, did not have the dedication, motivation, tasteful uncanny wit, and straight talent that is *given* to us in this oh-so-wonderful, keep on the shelf one-of-a-kind film. Definitely worth the buy. Thank you, fellas. You made me laugh as I prepped to dab my eyes, you made me chill to Dan ""The Man."" I watch it over. Each time catching another dash of the sometimes subtle (sometimes not) masterful dash of smart (sometimes smart-ASS) artful humor I missed before. Yes, you DID IT!! And for that, you ROCK!"
1,Awful.,I saw this movie in the theatre & was pretty excited; it was filmed near me. But Left/Right made me suffer. These boys are obviously driven (how else would they have made a movie?) but that doesn't mean they can write or act.
5,Simply exquisite!!!,"The drawings are inspiring and full of details.As I said in another review of a book of the same author (Ernst Haeckel), I recommend buy the other book too (Art forms from the ocean).They complement very well.You will no regret."
1,A ludicrous masterpiece,The most ludicrous book I have ever read. The author has introduced a new religion to the humanity with its foundation based on trial and error. Just fascinating!
2,Can't use it,"Unfortunately the open space within the frame isn't large enough to reveal the letters/numbers on my license plate. It even covers the registration stamp in the upper right. The clearance is only 4"" from top to bottom so I can't use it with my California license plate. Measure before ordering."
4,A good set but still lacking some ...,"The first thing I have to admit is DG always makes beautiful and handsome boxed set. You can see illustrations and good essay about these masterpieces. Congratulation to Berman that he finished all pieces from 3 years of Liszt's pilgrimage with passionate and careful interpretation. I like very much the Vallee d'Obermann, Apres une lecture du Dante, and Tarentella. But as Simone said in another review, it still lacks some special features that only Horowitz can make. The problem that I have to rank this set 4 stars is the bad sound quality. You should buy it for collection because it seems the only complete set of Annee de pelerinage beatifully-made in a 3CDs set."
2,Digitally Remastered???,"For fans of David Allyn, his recordings are frustratingly obscure, nearly as elusive as the singer himself. So it was a pleasant surpriseto come upon this offering of a long out of print album---that is, until the MP3's were downloaded and played. Surface noise, unevenvolume and distortion made it clear from the start that the term ""digitally remastered"" has been used pretty loosely, in fact quite falsely,and the result is an insult to the discerning listener. Since making this selection, I've acquired an authentic digital recording of My Lucky Day whichputs this MP3 offering to shame. Which is to say that a proper remastered edition does exist, and it is superior to what is being peddled here."
2,Strong music dragged down by horribly infantile lyrics,"FUR AND GOLD was the debut album of English musician Natasha Khan, working under the pseudonym Bat for Lashes. The 12 tracks of the album are centered around Khan's husky alto and unusual instrumentation like harpsichord, maracas and handclaps. Some influence from American minimalist composers is evident in the construction of many songs from loops.Natasha Khan has some impressive musical skills, but the fatal flaw of Bat for Lashes' work is that the lyrics are concerned only with love, expressed in terms more common for a teenage girl than a mature woman artist. Repetitive imagery of hearts on fire, horses, knights in armor and such abound. Of the two albums that Bat for Lashes has released so far, I favour TWO SUNS (though it suffers from many of the same problems) and it's hard to recommend this debut."
2,when does it get funny,watched the first two sections - didn't even want to see the rest. I'd put one or no stars but can't get back to edit that.
3,Bad rap on Pogorelich may be deserved on this album,"The overall palette is marvelous on this recording, and the pianism is of very high quality. However, the excessive use of rubato and mannerisms make for a less than pleasurable experience. As a part of your Brahms piano collection, this is probably one to own. However, if this is the only one you'll have of the Rhapsody #2, for example, stay away from it as the rendition here sucks the life right out of the hard driving rhythm."
2,No return policy,"It did not have a radio, which is why I wanted it. It was advertised as the Nano Plus, and although I understood it was actually the 512 MB version in a note field, it never mentioned the radio feature was missing. No return policy has left me with something I don't want or need. I am not happy with this purchase at all."
3,"Love the player, disappointed with customer service","The player is great. It's small and feature-packed. I bought it for it's built-in FM radio and FM recording capability, but have also found much use for the voice recorder (and the MP3 player of course).The tab on the battery door broke off (without inordiate force involved) after 2 or 3 battery changes and Creative customer service refused to replace it (due to ""physical damage"") without charge."
2,Good and bad.,"I really like the crisp sound on this player and the fact that I can pop in rechargeable AAAs, but my computer will not recognize this player. It locks up my computer when I plug it in. I have to go to my kids' computer to load it with music. Creative's customer service is a joke. I don't have any problem with the Muvo Mix, but the Muvo V100 isn't recognized, either. I'm disappointed that such a common problem can't be resolved."
4,I like it so far,"I have only had it for 2 weeks and I am very happy with it so far. I have had no problems using it. The armband is great for running/excersize. I like the look and the size. Its my first mp3 player and it is perfect for my needs. The headphone sound quality is to my satisfaction. I did try using the ""line in"" function to record online radio shows. The recorded sound quality is not so good when I do this and it seems to timeout and shut down. I have not yet tried to line in function to rip mp3's from cds."
2,OMG,ok yea they pretty much suck and their songs do sound the same but the only reason i gave it a 2 is because the singer has an ok voice (when hes not screaming) but the music is really simple anyone can play it!! and thats a bad thinglateerrr
5,Finally Ohio has something to be proud of!,"Hawthorne Heights will make you a fan in one listen. All the songs have a similar sound but they are also vastly different. I first heard this band on a sampler from my Taking Back Sunday CD and they had ""Ohio is for Lovers"" I fell in love with the song and waited for the CD to come out. I found out a lot of the band members are from the city I live in so it was odd when I finally found their CD at our Target and their video is constantly playing when you go in there. I don't dislike any song on this CD and I love it because it is a great car CD. I love to blare it loud and rock out. If you like any screamo band you will love this band. Even though it is the popular punk thing at the time you will see them later as long as they stick together as they have a great screamo band. Hope their second CD is as good."
3,"Sadly, not that good...","I tried to like this album, I gave it many listens, I just can't get into it. It's bland, the vocals are flat and boring, and the guitar riffs are very predictable. There is a few decent songs on here, though."
2,Silence would be preferred...,"I'm only giving it two stars because one of the songs is actually not too bad ""Ohio is For Lovers"", other than that, do as I did and don't waste your money on this album. It's very dissapointing and unpleasant to the ears, and I usually enjoy some screamo."
1,Just a flat out horrible album.,"Boy Emo got big overnight and now everyone thinks they can be in an emo band!!! Lol. On a serious note, this is a pathetic generic album, it's hard for me to imagine teenage girls listening to this, honestly though it's hard for me to imagine anyone listening to this load of .... Bands like this are going to put a quick death to the emo scene, so if your wanting to check out this album, just wait one more year and you'll find it in the bargin bin with the rest of their horrid emo counterparts, which will be right next to a bunch of ska/punk albums and the new disgraceful weezer album."
1,Pathetic,"If you are thinking, ""oh, it can't possibly be that bad. i think i'll give this CD a try,"" STOP THINKING THAT RIGHT NOW! the only good song is ohio is for lovers. I'll admit i listen to some victory records bands like silverstein, atreyu, and martyr ad, but this is crap. i regret spending $8 on this CD used. so I sold it to some used book store and got $2 for it. pass this one up. You'll thank me for it."
1,Blech.,"One word: boring.The lyrics aren't very creative. Not to mention that the lead singers vocals aren't too great.I initially liked ""The Transition"" and ""Niki FM"", and of course the song that made me buy the album, ""Ohio is for Lovers"". After a couple of weeks, I got over it. ""Ohis is for Lovers"" is the only song I can stand listening to off of this album."
3,My Heart is in ohio,"i bought this cd b/c of hearing a song in a friends car. Nikki FM. well the cd isnt as great as the song but i also like the fact that they are from ohio and so am i. So of course i love the song ohio is for lovers. i was a little creeped out by the lyrics "" cut my wrists and black my eyes so i can fall asleep tonight or die"" but then i thought about it and the guy cant sleep b/c he doesnt have his girl. its kinda sweet. but for the rest of the cd it kind of makes me sad and i like more happy dancing music. but hey it's got two good songs for sure"
1,I Hate to Insult Your Taste in Music...,"But Hawthorne Heights really sucks. They are the most generic and homogenized band I have ever heard. Ok, i'll admit that the target audience for this is the 15-18 year old depressed emo kid demographic but come on, get a life, and go buy a Ramones album.What the worst part of this is that it goes around masquerading as punk. It's ok to admit that you listen to pop, but please don't try to pass this off as anything close to punk.I like to keep my negative reviews short and sweet, so in short avoid like the plague. If you fall into the 15-18 depressed emo kid in high school demographic, then it sucks to be you but you don't know any better. If your over 18 and like this, then your a media controlled tool. Quit reading this and go buy Minor Threat's Complete Discography. They are a real punk band, with real intensity and anger. Not manufactured bull crap."
2,Their 2nd cd better sound a million times better or i will cock punch EVERY member of HH,"very very very cliched emo/screamothe guy that tries too hard to scream is ugly which kills a percentage of HH. every song sounds the same, very slow with crappy lyrics. ""Transition, Blue Burns Orange, and Niki FM"" are the only decent songs...""Ohio..."" is good but very played out and HH playing on TRL killed their ""trying to be hardcore"" image...sorry HH but now i know why Ohio has hardly any rock bands"
1,"I'm Outside Of Your Window, Sweetheart!","I heard that song from the Hawthorne Heights, the one where the band member is dressed in a baseball cap and he's singing about cutting his wrists and blacking eyes. First off sir, why are you asking your ex-girlfriend to mutilate your body? Is your heart bursting with pain? For God's sake, I know break-ups are terrible but you don't need to go that far! I don't want to hear a song about his failure as a competent boyfriend. Maybe he should've stopped whining for a second and listened to what people are saying to him. And what's with Niki FM? Come on, that does not count as a real song! Actual lyrics: Breath in..exhale.. WOW!!! My head is spinning by the depth of his words! The Hawthorne Heights is another lame addition to music and I wish MTV would stop creating these emo people that piss me off."
1,Hawthorne Heights = horrible.,I agree with whoever recommended a purchase of ear plugs along with this CD. I think that says enough.
1,One Star? More Like Zero,"Read mightymouse's comment.I can't judge this album by just one song but I will. ""Ohio Is For Lovers"" is one (maybe is) the worst song I've ever heard. I don't appreciate crybabies that wine about how their ""girlfriend"" dumped him. I like music that has a lot of emotion, but this is not emotion. This is crap.To enlightnen yourself on good music you should buy: ""Reign In Blood""-Slayer, any Metallica album before the ""Black Album"", any Pantera CD, ""Rust In Peace"" or ""Countdown To Extinction""-Megadeth, ""War Within""-Shadows Fall, or ""The Wall""-Pink Floyd. This is real music."
1,cut your wrists and stop being a band,"i'm severely irritated with the fact that there isn't a zero star option on the rating solely because of this cd.all i have to say about this record is that i downloaded it out of curiosity over a year ago after first hearing about them, and i'm rather pissed off that i wasted my time and a perfectly good cd-r on it. ""cut my wrists and black my eyes""- it's nice to know that it's cool to be suicidal and 'goth' according to these 5 ohio rejects.and they've officially added 'ohio' to the endless list of things that are apparently for lovers.not to mention they put out a reissue to this cd almost a year to date after the original cd was released.this album, and the band, isn't even worth the time it takes to put one of the little cd dividers in the shelves in the stores it's sold at.for the record: ohio is not for lovers.hawthorne heights, please stop being a band."
1,Hawthorne Heights is the new Warrant,"Remember when 80's metal came to a screeching halt? Everyone blamed its demise on a little band out of Orlando called Warrant. They were the ones that were undeniably 5-10 years too late, 10x too unoriginal, and blasphemously copy-catting all of the other more successful predecessors of their musical movement. It was as if someone took Ratt, Bon Jovi, Krokus, Dokken, Scorpions, Judas Priest and boiled them down into a test tube and wrote an easy-to-follow formula on Warrant's chalkboard.Hawthorne Heights is that band for indie/post hardcore.I'm afraid we're at the end of an incredible musical movement pioneered by such bands as Hot Water Music (the original ""dual-vocal assault"", ""angst-ridden"", ""emotionally-driven"" indie band).You may thank Victory Record's gluttony for this."
2,"Okay, but sort of LAME","The movie was sort of cute, same characters, same voices but SUPER short - like 30mins and for the price was not worth it. I think it was on TV last year and I've seen it for less that $10 at the stores after I bought it here. My daughter liked the movie okay but hasn't requested to watch it again."
5,Cute Christmas Show!,"We are on our way to see the Merry Madagascar Ice Spectacular in Kissimmee, FL this Christmas. This video is helping my 2 year old get to know the characters so she can enjoy the event more this year!"
3,Okay!,The program is shortly entertaining. It could be longer or should have been made into a movie. You are left wanting more.
4,Bittersweet,"story of a couple with different goals. For once the husband is an overachiever and the wife is a slacker. We see them meet, fall in love, try to accept each others' families and friends, and slowly grow apart mostly due to her disappointment in herself compounded by a slight lack of reassurance on his part. It's clear that much of this material is written based on personal experiences."
5,technically sound!!!,The entire CD is full of LIFE.The Weber concertos are perhaps the best recorded.Each is expressive and envokes the mood of the peice.The Intro Theme and Variations by Rossini is phenomenal.Not to mention his wonderful technique.A must for any aspiring clarinetist!!!
5,"Amazing DvD Set, Buy Now!","I got my daughter this last christmas. She immediately opened it and popped it in the Dvd player. She was hooked! She watched the whole season in 2-3 days. The music was very nice and original, the actual show was pretty good. Cute, but as a mom I wouldn't watch this. She loves this set and takes very good care of it. If you have a daughter or son (13+) who likes action and a good plot, this is for them. Carefull though, it does say the 'd' word."
4,A good Choice,"Inuyasha is a very popular anime....nuff said. I would recommend this boxset among all the rest, because the show tends to ramble...alot. If u watch the first season you'll want to watch more but trust me, unless u juss want to see inuyasha get afew powers and never complete their main quest then go ahead, watch the other 6 or so seasons, but I recommend this one atleast."
3,Pilates For Men,"The exercises were correctly executed, the music was fine. The pace was fine, I liked the different levels, the exercises seemed appropriate for each level. Some of the stretches were really good.The Instructor is from Australia. The accent is a bit hard to take. The description of the pelvic floor for men was pretty funny ""As if you are stopping yoursef from breaking wind"". Also she showed a bit of moon-cleavage, which my teenage son kind of enjoyed!I might recommend it to a male client."
4,Good but long,"I bought this for my husband. He believes it helps his back and flexibility, which have been problems for years. His only complaint is that it is very long (about an hour) and sometimes he has to create his own stop and start points when he wants a shorter routine."
2,ho hum,"If you are a Seagal fan looking for an exciting action flick you might want to try something else. This is watchable, but nothing special. I rank this with The Patriot, Out For A Kill and The Foreigner as Seagal flicks which miss the mark. All actors have bad films. Seagal has 12 movies I really like, but this ain't one of em."
4,Ticker,"If you like Steven Segal and Tom Sizemore and action you will like this movie.If you're an action fan this is a must see, a lot of reviews were neg. I thought I like the actors so I saw it for [dollar amount] and was delighted."
5,Oh-so-very-Beautiful,"Have no doubt about it-- these Abbado recordings realize all the agonizing triumph, melancholy, and heartbreak of Tchaikovski's world-masterpiece final three symphonies. From the martial, epic spiritual strife of the Fourth's exalted opening movement to the searing death knell of the Pathetique's finale, every moment is gloriously realized. I'd carry this set around in a golden ark if I had one--it's 2 hours of delirious Romantic ecstasy, an out-of-body experience that obliterates any middlebrow doubts about Tchaikovski's transcendent, indispensable genius. You gotta have it."
2,2 stars for 2 good songs,"this cd was ok, I only bought it for jennifer love hewitts song ""how do i deal"", and there was only one other good song on there ""I try to say goodbye"", If your buying because of one of these songs you might be dissapointed because the rest of the cd is not to good"
5,a real good c.d.,i think this is a real good c.d. because it has a lot of good songs on it. but most of these artists aren't very popular.
1,Garbage,Received as a Christmas gift. Stopped reading any memory cards by April. Do not buy. There are several other manufacturers with better products.
2,Digital Spectrum MemoryVue,"I purchased this product about 2 months ago, the resolution is not the best but it's acceptable. After a month,it turned off by itself and wouldn't turn on again!! I sent it to repair and had to pay $50.00 !!!somenthing to do with the power button. I have it on a UPS with battery, also freezes for no reason. I don't recomend it."
2,Nice for 6 months,"I really liked the MV-800 after I got it for Christmas, but after 6 months it shut off and now will only run for a short time before it shuts down or the display freezes."
4,Better than I expected,Considering the typical poor review most items in this category receive I was pleasantly surprised when the MemoryVue MV-800 surpassed all my expectations. It's not perfect- the picture is a little soft and colors somewhat muddy but for displaying a slideshow of good quality digital photos taken in average conditions I think it's excellent. This one is for my mom and dad but I wouldn't hesitate to buy one for myself. The approximate 5x7 display size is perfect for desk or countertop. Apparently it plays music and video too but I haven't tried that yet. It does appear though that it's limited to playing a single video file at a time (rather than part of a slideshow) but I'm not certain of that yet. Most functions are operated via the included remote control but to play a slideshow simply plug in a memory card. Doesn't get much easier. Additional frames of assorted colors/styles are available through Pacific Digital. All in all an above average product.
5,Very solid CD.,"I found the songs in the original to be just 'okay', but the songs in the expansion are much better and more memorable, I believe. I'd definitely reccomend this to fans of the first soundtrack or people who thought the first soundtrack was a little dull and full of nothing but 'background' music."
4,Excellent Book,"This book is a very thorough and impressive review of what has been done in the field. I was not familiar with the subject and learnt a lot from this book.From a practical point of view, I miss better drawings. There are no dimensions on figures and the author state clearly at the beginning of the book that small features are not to scale. From a pedagogic point of view it is fine, but it is then difficult to apply these concepts."
3,Too slow to be 'joyful'....,"I know it's Bohm thing and I usually like it but the Ninth shouldn't be that slow... Beethoven wants it Presto but Bohm gives Andante... it just takes the 'joy' out of the music. ""O Freunde, nicht diese Tone"" shouldn't make you fall asleep, instead, it should make you 'move' and perhaps sing along."
2,"great artist, less than great book","I love Degas, so don't get me wrong. For a book as big as it is, it's lacking. Way too much text at the expense of Degas wonderful work. It is a big book, why are there so few big reproductions in it. There could be more color images too. This would have been a great book had they made use of the size and done a better layout between text and image, as all books on artist should be. It also seems like they've left out a lot of good stuff the should have had room for. Overall, it just seems like not much thought went into the actual layout of the book.I don't recommend it as a keeper book on Degas, however if you find a cheap copy, why not, it is Degas afterall and the reproductions do look decent."
4,It would be hard to fear death after reading this book!,"If I had the money, I would buy at least a hundred copies of this book for every hospital, hospice, or old age home in the world. The concepts may be just a bit simplified, but that very well may be just what is needed at this time in our human understanding - especially if you are facing death soon. This is easy reading. And believe it or not, it is light reading. There is no fear here, no gloom, and nothing depressing. And it is accurate according to my personal experiences. God Bless Ruth for writing this book! Now, if people would only read it."
1,Dark Picture,We have the VHS copy so just needed a copy on updated media. There are scenes on here that are so dark you cannot even see anything.
4,Perfect for the winter season!,"I bought this book last fall and used it constantly throughout the holiday season, and I plan to use it to make more snowflakes during the remaining winter months. The patterns are varying, although I would like to have seen a few more and some that were more like actual snowflakes. You can tat these patterns in almost any size thread and add beads, glitter, sparkly thread to make them more lifelike, and they make great ornaments for the Christmas tree or decorations for windows or gifts. They're also nice to tat during the hot summer months when you think you're going to suffocate from the heat and humidity ; )"
1,How the west wasn't won.,"An erotic journey from prim & proper to hot & nasty, NOT! Didn't like the style or the storyline. The wild west has seen better days. Mr. Artist Please Lighten Up On The Black Ink."
3,No Hat Included,My grandson was disappointed that a hat is pictured BUT NOT INCLUDED. This is the trouble with Amazon...you never know what you are really getting.
2,Paris in the Twenties?,"I had read a recent article indicating that this book was among a handful essential to an understanding of Paris in the 1920's, with a focus on cafe life and cuisine. The articles contained in this book are undoubtedly very sincere. However, I personally found several of them to be stilted and generally uninteresting, and even though I have a strong interest in the subject, they failed to hold my attention. In my opinion, Liebling's articles like ""Just About Money,"" ""The Afterglow,"" and ""Passable"" are among the better ones."
3,Spectacularly descent,"What a pleasant surprise! One shouldn't expect much from a movie based on a video game space war. Nonetheless, Wing Commander is a very decent movie. The plot is rather generic, but the actors work with it very well. The special effects are very good overall - the ugly costume design is easily forgiven. The combat is never thrilling, but is never boring. Much closer to Starship Troopers than Star Wars, Wing Commander is sure to satisfy fans of sci-fi movies. Those without such a fancy for the genre may wish to pass."
4,Wing Commander Is Good Entertainment,"Just a really good, popcorn eating movie for those cold, chilly nights when you want to 'leave' the planet for a spell. Not having played the game I had no pre-prejudice about this movie. The production set was great, well cast and filmed it would be nice to see more such entertainment like this. And I really enjoyed the soundtrack, awesome. After all, is that not what movies are all about?"
3,nice outer space romp,"nice brainless outer space fight with preety boyfreddie prinze jr, and a number of british speaking actorsand some french canadians...this flick is full of hi tech gagetry, and is best seenon a rainy nite, or saturday, if their is nothing to do."
4,The worst movie ever? Now THAT's rediculous...,"People that think this movie is a sign of Armageddon must not have seen many movies. The acting isn't the best, I'll admit it, but it's not all bad. Most of it's passable at least, I think. Come on, there are a lot of movies with far worse acting. The special effects aren't cutting edge, but the movie was low budget, and the ships looked a lot more realistic than the glossy starships and resorts in other Science-Fiction films. And I won't say this movie is bad because it's not exactly like the games; That doesn't have anything to do with whether it is good or not. Like it or not, I think this movie is good. Or fun, at least. (And if people hate this movie with a passion, why do they waste time preaching to people not to see it when they can come up with their own decisions?)"
4,Wing Commander dvd,"If you played any of the pc/video games than you know how much they left out of this movie. Still, its one of the best ""B"" movies I've ever bought. I enjoy it every time I watch it."
1,This is Brutal,"Wing Commander is clearly the worst movie of 1999. I advise anyone who is even considering sitting through this mess to think it over before shelling out money for a rental. Aside from some laughably bad acting and totally flat story, even the special effects are embarassing considering this is a major Hollywood movie. Essentially, this film is a study in 'bad', and it succeeds on all levels. Awful. Drough!"
4,A good first time effort...,"There are some dreadful flaws in this film. But as we all know by now, Wing Commander wasn't directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Given the lack of budget and the inexperienced director, Wing Commander still turns out to be enjoyable fluff."
1,Chris Roberts-Wing Commander,"This is a really good example of why Chris Roberts should stick to making games. The WC series of computer games was quite awesome. Wing Commander the game was sublime. Wing Commander the Movie, ridiculous. Roberts should've focussed on the game storyline and added hidden content that was missing or unknown but anticipated in the original and followup games. Instead, well, he gets carried away with a bunch of senseless content. Next time (if there is one) they should make sure a person who can direct is in charge. Also, don't waste the awesome content and storyline of the WC series. Keep the ships/guns as they were in the game. Don't waste the fans time and money please."
1,2nd worst movie I've ever seen,"The worst was Boys and Girls, another steaming pile of *bleep* starring Freddy Prince Jr. The only reason why I put this one ahead is because some of the space battle scenes are somewhat interesting to look at.Ok where do I start? The plot is garbage. Utter garbage. I don't even remember what it was about, that's how bad it was. Something about Space Pilgrims, and beating the Kilrathi (who look like rejects from the Broadway show CATS).The acting was terrible. Why did they not use Mark Hammil and that guy from Back to the Future? They were awsome actors in the videogames, why not use them? They are Hollywood actors for crying out loud! Maybe they wanted nothing to do with this garbage. Makes sense.One more thing. The fighters looked like something out of WW2. In a sci fi movie? That's never good. Play the game (even though it's old, it's still classic), but leave the movie out of your home."
4,The Movie,"Wow. Although in some areas [such as the Concordia coming AFTER the Tiger Claw's would-be destruction in the game Secret Missions 2] the movie was inacurate, the special effects and characters were excellent."
3,WITHIN REASONABLE LIMITS,"Whoa folks, take it easy! This film is no one's answer to the original Star Wars, but it is a more than respectable evenings entertainment, particularly if seen on DVD. The characters and situations are not especially original, however Tcheky Karyo is as cool as he was in the original ""La Femme Nikita,"" and newcomer (to me anyway) Saffron Burrows has a nice presence as well. The naval motif is quite refreshing in it's own way and the limits of the script are not so noticable if you put your player on pause every so often and get something cool to drink. An entertaining B-movie."
5,"A new spin on space movies, and it works","unlike other space movies that are just main character blows up everything that moves, Wing Commander focuses on the main charecter's background and how he hides it to avoid being persacuted, his best friend, and how he has to use his background to servive and to help the entire human race."
1,Is this really Wing Commander?,I mean I saw more special effects (not to mention actual Kilrathi) and talent in the game than in this movie. The kitties looked like statues and stiff. Only through a lot of sequals could this series ever hope to redeam itself. Can't see how Mr. Roberts could imagine this movie would be taken in by the game players of WC3 and WC4. You'll get more enjoyment playing those two games than this movie.
3,Not entirely that bad,"Ok, I loved the game and I admit it. Anyway, I hate this movie at first. It is similar to a 90210 in space like Starship Troopers but has lower budget. However, after seeing some Trek movies, I think I rather indure the pain with this one."
1,Great product. Poor shipping,"KLA is great stuff! I've been taking it for over 20 years and it's the only supplement that I must have. That being said, the shipper of my last order, AmericaRX, took a week to ship my KLA. If you want your stuff shipped a week after you order it, make sure you use AmericaRX..."
2,Too much on where to eat and stay,"The maps in this book were nice. 4 or 5 maps of different sections of the city and one nice subway map. BUT, the guide was heavy on where to eat and stay. I just prefer a map and info on the things to do in a city. I usually have my hotel reservation before I arrive."
3,Oregon Map,"I purchased both the Oregon Benchmark edition and the Oregon Atlas and Gazatteer edition on Amazon.com. The Benchmark one has considerably less detail than the second one I ordered. Often roads in the Benchmark edition are not named, and having traveled in the central part of Oregon, that can present problems. Personally I prefer the detail that the Oregon Atlas/Gazatteer (by Delorme) has to offer. This is not to say the Benchmark edition isn't helpful -- but having both to look through, I find the Delorme Atlas better suits my needs for more complete detail."
4,Great for Home Use,"I bought one of these around a year ago & I use it quite regularly to grind everything from wild duck & venison to whole chuck (inclusing almost a whole axis & a whole white tail). I've put a few hundred pounds of meat & vegetables (carrots, onions, &c.;) through it - including some secondary grinding for a finer consistency - & I've had no complaints. It does just what I need to make my own ground meat & pan sausage & it's easy to clean up.I'm just beginning to experiment with link sausage & it does very well on that front too, though that's not the primary function; for larger volumes, you might want to get a proper sausage stuffer so you don't tax the motor on this grinder.As long as you follow the instructions & put only appropriately sized chunks through it, you won't have any problems.Don't expect to grind bones.Don't expect to start a home butchering enterprise."
1,"Bad products, bad company","I'd give Villaware zero stars if I could.Bought a cookie press for my wife a few years ago, she used it 3 times and the plastic tube split on the 3rd time. It was normal, room temperature dough and the tube was less then half full. The company does not stand behind their products, don't offer replacement parts and then tell you to buy a whole new one.I'll never buy another Villaware product of any kind."
2,Embarrasing,"Why only two stars? It's not for subject matter, that's for sure.Having recently read the 1998 edition, I was utterly disgusted at the coupious ammount of basic English mistakes throughout the text. There was terrible grammar, bad sentence structure, wrong words in sentences, not capitalizing proper nouns, ad nauseum.Subject matter of this sort is deadly serious, and the book deserved much better proof reading and/or editing before being published. As if the subject matter itself won't be attacked by those being exposed, look at what an easier job they'll have trying to discredit this book (and Skousen) by easliy pointing out the many errors I just pointed out. It will only help perpetuate the (incorrect) stereotype of the un-educated nut/conspiracy theorist.If one wants to be taken seriously, one should put his ""best foot forward,"" ESPECIALLY when presenting such serious, and ultimately true stuff."
2,some great some terrible,"I absolutely LOVE Celine. But her approach in some of these songs is just too much generic pop. Two of favorite songs are on there as well (My Heart Will Go On and To Love You More). But most are just too tiring or boring to listen to. We played this CD in the car on a roadtrip and we'd keep saying, ""do you wanna skip this one?"" to eachother. That doesn't say much for it, does it?"
2,Boring,"This CD would be a lot better if for every time Celine sang the word ""love"" she substituted the word ""mayonaise."""
1,Ever try again Mrs. Dion!,"I wonder whose idea was that to create a NEW Barbra Streisand out of Celine Dion? He/she should have made the mistake of his entire life...This album may be commercial, I say nothing to that,BUT why does she shout so often even though she doesn't have a proper voice? And I DO think she doesn't know where to emphasize the words so the lyrics sound so awkward!(ex : ""Thatch"" instead of ""that""! - My Heart will go on)She should take two lessons :1. English 2. Singin'"
1,I'd give it 0 stars but thats not an option!,"I never particularly liked Celine but this CD is absolutely horrible. I am a teenager and my mom bought this CD for herself. I used to have to listen to it everyday in the car, but I got smart real quick and confonscated it so I didn't have to suffer any longer. I thought my eardrums were going to bust!!!"
5,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC,"I can't wait to purchase my next one. This is my first Celine Dion CD and I bought it because I wanted ""My heart will go on"" - theme from Titantic, but once I stared listening to the songs, they are absolutely fantastic. I especially like ""where is the love"", ""miles to go"", ""us"", ""to love you more"", and ""let's talk about love"", let's face it I love the entire CD. Celine has such a wide range to her singing, she is a exceptionally talented lady, each of her songs have their own unique sound. She can go from a rap type song in ""treat her like a lady"" to a Mariah Carey type song in ""Love is on the way"". I get goose bumps just listening to her. She puts so much depth and meaning into each of her songs its amazing. If you buy this CD you will not be disappointed and you will definately get your money's worth and more. From the first song on this cd to the last you will be so moved that you can't wait to hear it again. I just can't say enough about a truely exceptional album."
2,2 of 15 songs,"While I'm a big fan of Celine, this CD was a big disapointment. There are only two really good numbers on the CD while the other 13 range from fair to just plain bad.On this CD it appears that Celine tried numbers that really aren't her style, and are ""dangerous"" to her voice. She is best when she does ballads and love songs.A ""Rock"" or ""Rap"" star she is not."
4,nice songs,"I like all the songs very much, especially ""My Heart Will Go On"" and ""Let's Talk About Love"". Celine Dion really has a wonderful voice. It's worth buying this album."
3,The best of Celine Dion,"Celine Dion is a great singer. This album definatly shows off her voice. Duets with the Bee- Gees and Barbra Streisand, and the famous theme from Titanic, My Heart Will Go On. If your a Celine Dion fan, buy it. If not, don't bother."
2,Falling Into You and Unison are better,"This CD is disappointing. It has a few good songs (like ""My Heart will Go On""), but most of them are sleepers. If you like that song, then go ahead and get this CD, but you may want to skip it if you're just assuming this will be as good as her past CDs."
2,Not very uplifting,Except for the rendition of 'Ooshton Hauston Bergasson' the rest is fairly mediocre.
1,"Celine--Feelin' Sad, Soundin' Bad","In this CD, Celine sounds both melancholy and, more importantly, cacophanous. Which isn't to say she's not talented--she is. But unfortunately, many years of whining, and countless CDs with the word ""love"" in the title make her a bit difficult for even the most ardent music lover to handle."
3,"Sorta Flimsy, But Worth Having","This album contains duets with Lucianno Pavorattie and Barbara Streisand - I dislike both of them. I just don't like them. But this album has it's good traks. And they are 'Treat Her Like a Lady,' 'My Heart Will Go On,' (from Titanic) and 'Let's Talk About Love.' A romantic CD, flawed, but nice to own."
4,An excellent effort.,"I think this is a great album, from ""My Heart Will Go On,"" to ""When I Need You,"" and ""Immortality,"" but it is still pale by comparison to her last album, ""Falling Into You."" If you like this album at all, you will love ""Falling..."""
2,Listen to Sarah McLachlan For Soothing Music,"I do agree that Celine Dion has an amazing voice, but I am growing tired of her act. I used to love her in 1991/1993 when she wasn't as big, and just broke into the United States market. Now she is overhyped, and ruined the whole ""Titanic"" film by her overemphasis in the song. If you want soothing music, listen to Sarah McLachlan. She has a beautiful voice and doesn't need to scream at the top of her lungs to prove it. Heck, Sarah could sing the phone book and make it sound good."
2,Just more of the same,I used to like her music but a lack of variation in musical-style means: that of late - as evidenced by that quite wretched song from the 'Titanic'- she has begun to sound more and more like a coyote on a hill howling at the full moon. She is becoming too bland and one-dimensional in her presentation.
4,Let's talk about a hit,"this album has been a massive hit everywhere in the world and represent for Celine the peak (up to now) and the highlight of her career.A great exemple of that is the fact that she broke a record in Europe with 9 000 000 copies sold.It's certainly one of the biggest hit of the 90's as well as MY HEART WILL GO ON, a too much heard song, i think.But there is some great songs like TELL HIM,IMMORTALITY, LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE, US AND OTHER.In fact, these songs are great but not attractive so that i could listen to them really often, for me. But anyway, one song is incredible : it's TO LOVE YOU MORE(u.s. only).What a wonderful song!!!Finally, you'll ENJOY this album but not as falling into you or others. ANOTHER FACT: 30 000 000 fans cannot be wrong..."
2,Color not as advertised,"These were the only towels I wanted because I heard they were plush and the picture shows very ""bright"" ""hot"" colors and so that's why I ordered these instead of any others, because I could not find any other towels that looked so bright, and I checked numerous sites.But upon arrival the blue towel I ordered (Poolside) was not the same bright color as the picture. It's a regular light blue - nothing special about it. I will be returning it and can get the same towels for less money at target, walmart of kohl's. I think what you're paying for is ""the name"" because it definently wasn't as bright as they show it on the picture."
2,OK for cheap towels,"These towels are not very soft, and the blue color is too bright for my bathroom. I am now using them to protect my uphostery from a child's car seat, and they look much better than white ones on the black leather."
2,Middle School Book Report,"This is a below average Civil War book. It reads like a middle schooler wrote this for a project. Nothing really new was presented in the text and if you've read anything on Grant or Sherman in the past I would ignore this one. I can't believe this book was on a list of ten must reads for the 150th. The amount of errors in dates and facts makes this book seem like an attempt to make a quick buck. Example: page 362 states that Seminary Ridge was a battle fought in the West. Come on! Seriously? Page 219 states that Sheridan was brought South to help the beseiged Union soldiers at Chattanooga...Wrong again! Page 160 says that the Battle of Fort Hudson was part of the Red River Campaign. Nope! There are several more. A lot of spelling errors that could have been solved by simply looking at a map! I'm no expert, but I could've written a better book."
5,An Excellent Read...,"I attended an engagement where the author spoke about his book. Aside from the story of the book itself, what I thought was very interesting was the typed ""Insert"" that was handed out. (I also understood that it would be included on Amazon's website but have not seen it.) As the approximately 10-page Insert states, it contains ""vignettes"" about the author ""as background"" for ""releases and interviews"". Having not seen this before in connection with a published book, and after listening to a wonderful presentation, it gave me a more personalized view of the author, his creative approach to selecting the subjects he writes about and helps support his credibility as a historian and scholar. Flood's education, life experience and proven record of accomplishment convinced me to buy the book. Having now read it, my ""hunch"" was correct and I highly recommend it."
4,Completely evil,I cannot stress how crazy awesome this CD really is. The riffs are absolutley insane. Extreme metal fans must own this CD. Buy it now and enrich your life.
2,this is not chelsea!,"this is crazy,I love my scenes but this is crazy.I will still get tis doll but. They are Not the my scenes I know.this is so crazy. she looks like one of those teen agers who want to look ""cool"".I will probably have nightmares about this doll!# 1 my scene lover"
1,LMAO!! THIS IS THE GREATEST JOKE EVER MADE IN HISTORY!!,"ITS TIME FOR MY SCENE FASN WHO CALL BRATZ SLUTTY TO EAT THEIR WORDS!! LOOK AT CHELSEA'S SKIRT!! ITS SO FREAKIN' SHORT AND TIGHT HER SKIRT MIGHT JUST RIP WHEN SHE'S DANCING!! SO WHO IS SLUTTIER NOW?? BRATZ ARE APPROPRIATE DOLLS AND THEIR CLOTHES ARE FABULOUS UNLIKE MY SCENES!! I HAVE A MY SCENE DOLL AND AFTER CHANGING HER CLOTHES FOR LONG, THE VELCRO CAME LOOSE!! CALL THAT QUALITY?? MY FOOT!!"
1,Waste of money,Dont order the glass thing. First time I used it to replace the old on it broke. Came shipped loss in the box also... Just saying I wasted my money. Thank God I ordered the new coffee pot also or I still couldnt make coffee .
2,not much substantive,"Agreeing with the other low-rating reviewers: this film does not give you much more than you already know. The images are nice at the beginning, but they don't take you into any new or deeper way of thinking about the material. I'd recommend others first -- Blue Gold, for instance."
1,"yank 'em, jerk 'em, scare 'em half to death","Modern scientific training uses operant conditioning with positive reinforcement to produce dogs who are happy, eager, willing partners. Think about that and look at the photos of the German Shepherd who modeled for this book. See those pinned ears and rolled-back eyes? See how the trainer is knocking the dog off his feet with a strangle collar? Can you say ""cruel and out-of-date""?If you want a pleasant family pet with good manners, work from Pat Miller's ""The Power of Positive Dog Training."" If you're training for formal obedience, try Morgan Spector's ""Clicker Training for Obedience."" Have a dog who's thrilled to cooperate with you -- not a dog who's too terrified not to."
5,"Not misslabled, it IS the Complete First Season","People keep complaining that this set is missing the first 3 episodes. This is not true, as ""Home is Where the Spark is"" IS the first episode. Transform and Roll Out was produced AS A MOVIE, and was only split into episodes for reruns.This season also has several great episodes, such as Blast from the Past (Introducing the Dinobots), Thrill of the Hunt, and my favorite, Sound and Fury, introducing my favorite character, Soundwave."
5,Cool Movie,Really fun series. We've been watching it on the Internet so it was fun to really have it.
4,"Wonderful Music, Rip-off price","I love this disc. A wonderful singer performing wonderful music. The Morrison poems are hauntingly set by Previn, and the Barber gives Dawn Upshaw a run for her money, the Gershwin as near-perfect as one could hope for. But it's a total cheek to charge this kind of money for a 40 minute disc. In keeping with the American flavour of the disc, how about some orchstrated Barber songs or his opera arias? Copland? More Gershwin? Adams? Even some of Previn's other wonderful music could have notched this into 50 minutes. I feel ripped off."
5,Best heating blanket ever!,"I had previously had another heating blanket from another company that continually showed an ""error"" message which resulted in my shaking the blanket to reset the system. Finally, after putting up with that for three years, I decided to toss that and purchase another blanket and, after reading many other reviews on this product, decided to give it a try - I am highly satisfied by my purchase and will actually be purchasing two more as gifts."
4,Good Price for a brand name quality part -tight,"They work. The optical audio cable makes a huge difference over the analog red-white wires I had. The cables are thick and feel well-made especially for the price ($28.58 now). These are made in China; I could not find cables made elsewhere for anywhere near the same price.One complaint is that the component cables fit very tight; I actually pulled one of the metal connectors off my TV trying to get a wire off! Luckily I was able to put that connecter back on and don't notice any difference in picture/color quality.Next time I'll use some di-electric grease to put these on.UPDATE, these have taken all three of my wire connectors off my TV... 'wish I could lower my stars given..."
5,Superb cables at a steal of a price,"These cables are very high quality, durable, and transmit a consistent signal. Much better han speding 100 on a set of cables at your local retailer. These are perfect for your home entertainment needs."
5,Mystery #28,"When Abby comes from school one day and finds a baby on her front porch, she's completely mystified. Where did the baby come from. And why did they leave it at the Stevensons' front porch. Abby's mom convinces the authorities to let the baby, whom the family dubbs Eli, stay at their house. Abby and the BSC Needs more ansewrs for Eli!"
5,"Always do good to strangers,they can be relatives!","I always enjoy Ann M Martin's books,especially those where you get to know more characters! This book really is one of my favorite BSC books!"
4,Abby takes responsibility with a new mystery babe!,"Abby is suprised to find a baby on her doorstep.So it turnsinto Mystery time for the BSC.Everyone has their suspicions.And Abbys mom is on a gig that is involved with the babe.Not exactly 2 thumbs up but so-and-so.Maybe half a gold star,too.I would say its one of the BSC's second base champions.I think,maybe,it might be the best.-Anna Hyclak(number #1 BSC fan"
4,not too shabby,"this is the australian band's greatest hits collection, and while i like listening to the actual LPs a bit more--because their generally very cohesive albums with steady thematic undertones--this gives a satisfactory view of their career on the charts, including all the hits and cult-favorites. there are some positively scorching numbers on here...songs so full of passion that even their biggest hit, ""beds are burning,"" pales in comparison and seems almost flakey. great liner notes tell the inspiring true story of the band's rise to fame and influence."
4,nostalgic!,I heard a couple of midnight oil songs on my Sirius and decided to see if I could find some tunes on amazon. It's a good disc. Some of the tunes are a little out dated but the good ones are still real good. I will definitely be looking for some more oil for my collection.
3,I liked a bit I did.....,"Well, the main theme is good, but, in my view could have done less of the percussion side, but thats just Elfman init! we can forgive him for that.The rest of the CD is just typical Eflman, this man was born to write music for 'comic book films' and his style is so simply reconisded because the music is so sad and depressing, this score kind of reminded me of 'Batman Returns' which, in my view, was a terrible score.Men in Black however has good points and bad points, the action music to this CD is 'fun' to listen to while the more slower tracks are just too depressing. One of the tracks that I seemed to listen to over and over again was the last one, not the closing theme, the one before that. The choral element to this track is truley amazing and ends with a short outburst of the main theme, very nice.Other than that, the CD seems to be about average, its just sounds a bit to wierd."
1,Disappointed,"We were very disappointed in this selection...especially because it was supposed to be the best of the best shows, and it was very expensive. We just didn't enjoy the selections....overall, were very disappointed."
1,Category4,DVD can no be played on a DVD player in Australia as it is classified category4 and I was not told of this
2,Missing almost all the music,"This collection was a disappointment. Nearly all the musical numbers have been cut from the episodes. I assume this is because of the costs associated with securing rights to the songs. How foolish is it for agents and performers to set their rates so high that their music disappears from view (and they collect nothing)! So what you get are interviews and comedy sketches, and maybe a song or two from Dean. The earlier ""best of"" series was much better as it focused on the musical numbers. Another missing element are ""Dean's Girls""--- the Golddiggers and the Dingaling Sisters. Since they did mainly musical numbers (their own or as backups for guest stars), they have been cut from the episodes except for when they do introductions. At the end of each episode, you can see stills from the many segments that were cut from the DVD as the credits roll. And don't look for Joey Heatherton or Ann-Margret, they are not in this set. You'll have to settle for Florence Henderson."
5,Value Inflection Points,"In this book, Rob guides you, from the perspective of an investor, through the process of evaluting proposals, making investments in and nurturing startup companies. One key topic he touched on is the notion of value inflection points as being the step stones of increased company worth as the company matures. In other words, there are certain events or milestones in a company's history that, when executed or met, significantly increase the company's valuation. Rob, reading your book was a big time value inflection point for my new company."
3,It has some decent parts.,I agree with the other reviwers about its faults. Buy it if you can used. By the way a good read on this subject is the manual mentioned in the ads on this page www.antiventurecapital.com
1,Absolute trash!,"I am a graduate archaeology student with a heavy professional interest in Ancient Egypt. This book is an insult to another open-minded person. It is a mix of other people's ideas with his own radical theories (you only have to visit his website to see what a lunatic he is). The poured block theory is J. Davidovits', and has been disputed by the geologist James Harell. The current archaeological evidence for Ancient Egyptian building techniques is covered in Dieter Arnold's :Building in ancient Egypt"", and the latest on the Giza ramps is available on Zahi Hawass' Guardian website.A previous reviewer describes the writing as that of a young adult. Sir, that's an insult to young adults who have better brain patterns than this author.Warning: BUY THIS BOOK AT YOUR PERIL!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Essential introduction into teaching about death for everybody. It`s very positive. Enjoy the life because you will die one day.,Essential introduction into teaching about death for everybody. It`s very positive. Enjoy the life because you will die one day. Absolutely needful thing in your library. I wish everybody would have chance to read this book...
5,Dying Well,"The moment we are born, we begin the journey to death. Dying well is all about living well. Great book."
4,Comprehensive.,"This is a book of Tibetan Buddhist Tantra, also known as Tibetan Vajrayana. The author (or perhaps the editor) hasdone a very good job of organizing this book (which will be relevant even in a decade).This book is quite comprehensive, in that you don't feel like a beginner after reading this book (even though youstill are).Don't get me wrong, one of the reasons I like this book and find it very easy to understand is because I have studiedmany mystical texts."
1,Hate it,"the book cover is horrible, it's folded in so many places. The cover is not even the same color as the picture shows. It's like being lied to. I don't like that."
3,About Living and Dying,"I was a bit disappointed in this book, being that it is more an 'about' type book, rather than a 'how to' book.I did find some priceless gems in this book, that I have not read elsewhere, and it did introduce me to a new concept on living and dying.The book did tend to drag on at times, and is 370 pages long. When the author started using all the eastern terms, my eyes just glazed over. If it was written by someone like Adyshanti, I would have gotten allot more out of it.That said, I think every reader will come away with something out of this book."
5,"Wonderful, Engrossing Movie","One of my favorites. A movie that will keep you guessing till the very end. Nat Serling is sent home from the Persian Gulf with traumas and few prospects after being in a friendly fire incident. He is given what should have been an open-and-shut case: investigate a female chopper pilot for the Medal of Honor. Things become tricky quickly as Serling's support is withdrawn when he discovers discrepancies in the witness' stories and he will have to risk everything to find out the truth about what happened on a dark night in Iraq. Magnetizing throughout, this picture is well-conceived and very compelling, and it has messages about society. Excellent directing and writing, as well as amazing acting, this movie shines."
3,ECHOES OF RASHOMON,"Matt Damon can be seen here in one of his first roles, and this role was largely overlooked, overshadowed perhaps by the star power of Meg Ryan (in the least annoying role I have ever seen her play) playing a tough commanding officer during Desert Storm, or overshadowed by Denzel Washington, investigating the circumstances surrounding her death. Damon may even have been overshadowed by the presence of an insane, glory seeking Lou Diamond Phillips. Damon's heroin-addicted character, though, is one of the reasons this film stands out in my mind. Also the story-telling technique of flashing back through different character's eyes is borrowed from such classic films as Kurosawa's Rashomon. It expertly illustrates the importance and use of point-of-view, which is totally different and distorted depending upon whom you consult."
1,comptorller,"Bad Experience.I placed the very expensive order, confirmed it and received a confirmation.Only 44 minutes later this very expensive order was duplicated without authorization.I notified American Express that I will not be paying for duplication, and requested a return authorization.American Express knows our shopping pattern and these things do not happen to us with reputable companies."
1,Poor Writing of a weak plot,"This was a very poorly written book with a boring plot. I have never quit a book that I was reading, but this is the closest I've ever come. It took all of my will power to get through this cliche-ridden, repetitious, long-winded non-thriller. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,bland and hard,Bought six pack of these two months ago and have yet to finish the first one - no matter how hungry I am I would rather go to bed hungry than eat these ...
4,Worth the Wait,"Okay.. I have wanted this cd for about a year, and now that I have finally gotten it for Christmas I can say, it was definitely worth the wait. I had heard a few parts from some of the songs on it and was intrigued with just 30 seconds samples so you can imagine the overwhelming excitement of finally hearing entire songs. All of the tracks on this cd are captivating and pure indie goodness wrapped up in a little bit of pop and emo. You can't deny that all the upbeat punk-ish songs on this album are contagious. But my personal favorites are the slower more melodic songs like ""Five little Graves"" or the beginning of ""Sixty-five percent"". Not to mention ""Traveler"" which is one of the songs on this album I continue to play on repeat. All of their catchy melodies and creative lyrics just pull everything together in a great indie/emo package. Although some parts are kind of cliche, this album is one to put on your list for sure. Yay ivory coast!"
4,Interesting perspective,"Not all the great investing books are available in audio format but as someone who has started from the basics, I found this helpful. The other two helpful books on CD from the Genre are Philip Fisher's common stocks, uncommon profits and Ben Graham's Security Analysis.The book is a first person narrative and more a story than advice but it gives a good perspective on the psychology of the market and its operators which I found invaluable."
4,Enlightening book,This book has a lot to offer a trader. It is about the greatest trader that ever lived. While not written that well there are yet gems of data that make it worth the time and effort. It can apply to any market - not just stocks.
4,An entertaining and practical text.,"This is an amusing book describing the trading life and practices of famous stock operator in the early twentieth century. The book chronicles the evolution of trading practices of Jesse Livermore, from stock speculation to market manipulation. However, the practical aspects of the book are in some ways limited because of the technical developments in security trading. But still, sound advice in stock trading is given throughout the text, which is still relevant and will be for decades. This is an entertaining book for any trader, technical analyst, or individual interested in the practical aspects of how capital markets function."
5,The Greatest Traders' Biography I Ever Read,This is one of the greatest books on trading psychology I've ever read
4,Some Thngs Never Change,"I heard Cramer mention this book. He said it was his favorite book about trading. LeFevre was a kid without any formal education who started working for brokerage houses around the turn of the 20th century. His reminiscences of how he developed into the incredible trader he became is both refreshing and familiar. The stock market was a totally different world in those days and many of the institutions which were part of it no longer exist, but the principles LeFevre writes about are unchanging.A great read and a surefire way to get your head on straight and deal properly with the fear/greed bugaboo."
5,Very strong read.,"It is amazing how long ago the core of this book was written yet the relevance of this material is spot on.An excellent read getting into any type of trading (I trade currencies).The morals become extremely potent once you have made and lost, and made (and lost) some money.By far the best trading book I have ever read."
5,Fun / interesting read,Fulfills expectations you can have of this classic. Even though it was written in 1920s it contains timeless insight into trading and the stock markets. I found this a better read if you already have a grasp of the financial markets.
4,Great cornerstone for a solid trading education,"Looking back on my trading career, I am grateful to have read this book when I did. It helped me frame my reactions to market moves and understand what to expect when I started trading, otherwise I would have torn my hair out a long time ago. It presents in a compelling anecdotal style what you can come to expect as a professional trader. The ups, the downs, the doldrums during vacation times, the market panic, etc. I recommend it to anyone who wants to begin trading. When you are done with that, then I recommend you check out a market timing book like Connors VIX Reversals and a simple, effective trading strategy like the One Day Breakout Method. These two books alone will help you make a lot of money in the markets. Take it from me and the thousands of dollars I lost before I decided to make my trading life less complicated."
1,I haven't received the book at all,"I do think it's a great book, that's why I ordered it overseas.But,after a long-time-waiting,I haven't received it yet.So I don't have chance to read it at all."
3,Good but not great,Green colored fabric has faded a little after one year. Finial on top is plastic and has faded significantly after one year.
4,Perfect present,This book is the perfect present as the characters are all ready wrapped and ready to go! Delightful treat! Its a good book for all children as the youngersters practice counting and older students learn more about Egypt!Great book!
1,DOES NOT WORK!,I never even got to use this bubble blower! Water splashed on it and it did not work from the get go. Imagine a bath toy that will break when it comes in contact with water. Hello? Ofcourse it will! DO NOT BUY IT!
1,Dumb buy!,"This product was horrible. The motor inside was broken and it didn't even blow bubbles. Bad bad bad buy!!!!! I was tempted to buy the bubble machine from disney, I probably should have!!!!!"
1,"Fun, but not for bathtub","Lots of bubbles BEFORE using it in the bathtub. The first time it was suctioned to the bathtub wall it fell off. It was properly suctioned and was not disturbed by kids. The next time it was used in the bathtub it fell off again and hit our 13 month old on the head. These two very brief drops in the water ruined the motor. We were really excited about it for the tub, but it was a very disappointing purchase. Unfortunately, it does not hold up to very gentle bathtime use."
1,jns,"My daughter LOVED this toys for the first week, until it stopped working. Like another reviewer noted, it was not submerged in water when it quit working. Additionally, there is no special battery protection to keep water from running in and rusting them. What a disappointment."
4,Ruth Rendall mysteries,Huge fan of Colin Firth and purchase all his movies. I especially love some of his earlier works. I enjoyed this set.
4,Punahou!,"Very good book that describes coming of age in a racially charged environment. Kirby Wright has written an engaging, well-thought novel that will delight his readers!"
1,Advertising on the CD,"The songs are good, but since when do they put an advertising track on the tape. I didn't buy this to have advertising."
4,Great for fibromyaglia,I have fibromyalgia and this product is the only one that can work my muscles properly. I can lie on the machine using my own body weight as pressure. It is perfect for working out knots in my shoulders and even my lower back. I highly recommend this product!
2,Not that great,"It's for one size only body frames. I wanted to use it mainly for an upper neck massage. I'm behind a computer all day at work so I get tense in the upper shoulders and neck. The distance between each set of ""balls"" is too far. My husband is much bigger than I am so it fits him perfectly. Be mindful that you should be careful with how long you use it and how much pressure. I didn't realize it but I actually woke up the next morning after using it with sore muscles. I used it to get some relief from neck and shoulder pain. What I got was muscles that weren't sore before that are now."
3,Staionary massager,"I thought this massager would be good for my feet, but is way too strong. The unit stays in one position and does it work just fine, and you must move the unit around your back, or move your feey."
4,Great composer,"Tord Gustavson is a very spoecial composer of European jazz lineage. Not your action prone dynamic American style jazz at all. He takes you to your deeper side, the world of dreams and meditation. This is one of his finest."
3,Partially present,Quietly melodic piano-based trio jazz of the interesting-but-hardly-engaging variety.
3,takes more than a listen to.........,"I loved Tord first cd . This mix of orientalisim , romantisim , the slow tempo .....everything worked . On this 3rd cd , it took me awhile to get to the music . I first found it much to slow , some of the best tracks are actually hidden in the end of the cd , the last 4 or 5 tracks , couple in the beginning , and then a long and empty passage in between . Tord is a wonderfull artist , with a great sense of drama , but I think he falls a little short on his 3rd cd ."
3,Sweet romantic comedy.,"This movie will be a favorite with those that enjoy such titles as: Sleepless in Seattle, Crazy from the Heart, and My Best Friend's Wedding. It is a romantic comedy that has the unassuming boy-next-door waiting in the wings for the career girl to figure out he has more to offer her than the flash-in-the-pan guy that she is attracted to."
1,Terrible,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Jennifer Aniston is a selfish, inconsiderate, corporate ladder climber the entire movie, but we're supposed to like her because she is pretty and has a nice smile? And she ends up with the guy she has walked all over the entire movie? And when she disrupts another couple's wedding with another selfish antic, everyone cheers her and thinks it's charming? Disgusting!"
3,Good but not memorable,"There are very many commentaries on Isaiah, ranging from the useless to the excellent. This commentary is probably above average. It has the advantage of being bang up to date, but nothing much else to distinguish it from the pack. It treats the first 39 chapters (the so-called First Isaiah) as a reasonably united work, not trying to tear it into pieces and assign it to several different authors as some commentators have done, but not ruling out subsequent revisions and editorial adjustment."
1,Piece of junk,"I've had this mower for three years. I've changed the oil in it regularly, Cleaned the filter and kept it inside. Up until the end of last season it ran great. Now however, it will barely run. I've pulled the carburetor apart, cleaned the pick-up tube and changed the plug but to no avail. I have a similar mower with a rear bagger and slightly bigger engine and am having the same problem. For me, I'm staying away from anything with a Briggs and Stratton engine and I'd suggest anyone else do the same!"
1,SO...... Late,I ordered this book and did not receive it until the class was half way over. I would not recommend using this company.
5,More than just words on paper...,"When you open ""Faerie Whispers"" pages for the first time the words swallow you, bringing you down into the world of Psychofairy, a world filled with pain, confusion, happiness, lust and love.More than just poetry, the book boasts powerfully written journal entries, taking you along on an emotional journey with her, one that rattles your soul - and leaves it deeply touched as well.This more than just words printed on paper...this is her heart, the heart of a true poet - a true artist. A secret artist."
1,The original unabridged version from the 60s.,"The first print edition from 1965 was read to me, as a joke. I was then told that in the current edition 17 chapeters (mostly the ones of Hubbard bashing the nontraditional role of women) had been omitted. I would give the original version a very low rating & the editors of the current version a high rating for cleaning up the mess.Imagine if the bible & koran were this politically correct enough to modernize their teachings & rewrite their books to actually suit the fancy of their religion's followers instead of having them cherry pick which parts reflect modern societal standards & which parts are just old stories ment as examples not to be taken seriously. It would be for the best if they did."
1,Not sure what it does,Only had for a couple months but doesn't seem to do anything for teeth or hair. Doesn't seem to help much with pain either.
1,Bad side effects,"Never try any supplements before speaking with your doctor. I took this MSM and messed up my hormones, caused weight gain and enlarged breast...Be careful!"
2,.....not impressive,"I love Ms. Mutter and how she plays, but I have to say this was one of her worst albums. I thought that the Tzigane was very good and different from all the other recordings of it and it kept me listening but the Sarasate......was not that impressive. The Zigeunenrweisen was very just there. It wasn't great or junk it was just....there...The Carmen Fantasy though was horrible, i think she shoulda redone the last movement where she coulda practiced her shifts...I think that Pearlman and Sarah Chang played the fantasy with the Zigeunenrweisen much better. SO i think u shoulda waste ur time on this album, buy Chang's Fire and Ice was much better than this album..."
3,Some Interesting Titles,"I bought this primarily for La Mer, which is one of the few songs I listen to repeatedly. (Another is Boum.) Material is dated and could do with better digital remastering, but not a bad collection."
3,Are these songs really remastered?.. NO!,"I bought this cd hoping to have remasters of the Tracy Byrd hits from his MCA releases. No remastering here! They have just taken his hits & compiled them into a nice collection. When I played the first track, 'Holdin' Heaven' next to my old one from the 1993 MCA cd, it is exactly the same. No difference in sound quality at all. And the rest are the same. Now, usually when the claim of 'remastered' is bogus, they at least have made the tracks louder, to fool you into thinking it's better. Not here. They are all the exact same as his original MCA recordings! So, if that's what you're looking for here.. a remastered set of Tracy Byrd hits, buyer beware. If not, well.. it is the most complete collection of his best work & they are some great old songs!"
4,BayWatch Fan!,I gave this to my Mom and she loved it! Brought back memories! The music theme was different- but she still was a happy camper!
2,missing episodes?,"Amazon listing says ""Race Against Time: parts 1 and 2 are included, but other places say it isn't. Is it included?"
2,my review for season 3 baywatch or i should say season 4,i thought i had order season 3 and some how don't tell me how i got season 4 of baywatch instead !!!! they ruined the beginning of the show using different music for the theme song !!! so i wouldn't waste your money !!!
5,"No, My Scene Won't Be Canceled.","There are a lot of haters who say that, but it isn't true. These dolls are beautiful. And did you know the Nolee's skirt detaches to make a swimsuit? This doll is so not revealing. Nolee is gorgeous. What happened? I thought the 'war' was ending, ut all of a sudden, it started up again. I'm so tired of this."
1,"Skimpy clothes,too much makeup","Need I say more than just the title? The My Scene dolls are usually great,like I have said in other reviews,but these are not exactly what I'd call 'role model material.'"
2,a goofy read for children,"This is a story written so far out in left field that it is kind of entertaining. It is a space romance that is as hard hitting as a soap bubble.What made the first book in this series so interesting is pretty much lacking here. By this I am talking about the surreal dream like quality that pulled out unusual though inspiring visions to dawdle over. Instead we are presented with a story that follows the most predictable 'read it before' plot lines that seem to float by without struggle.This might be a good series to read with your kids, but you can find better books in that regards as well (Pullman, Harry Potter, Narnia, and Watership Down)."
4,Pointy pencils,"Excellent product, better than most of the other brands.I had almost given up on electric sharpener until I saw this model.Only one caveat: it only takes pencils of standard diameter --somecolor pencils are slightly thicker and they will not fit. So it isnot royalty but it is sharpening aristocracy."
2,This one stinks,"IT does not make a sharp point on the pencil. Their is an auto stop feature which would be nice but it stops the pencil from being 100% sharpened. Also, I put this in my classroom and it broke within a week. Not good for high usage areas."
2,sucky doll,this doll is not fun because i burn it and it still is in one piece darn it these toys are too durable!!!!!! i hate it!!!!!!!!!these toys are so (...) sucky buy them anyway and waste your money.
5,Great Product,"I had seen similar items at retail stores for a much higher price. This product is well worth the money. It has everything that you need, all in one kit. It was easy to set up and works flawlessly. I would recommend this product to everyone."
5,"The One to Get, Works Perfect with Screens that cover components","Great price, and works perfectly. Simple installation."
3,Not at all,"I didnt go into listening to his cd thinking it was going to be like the last one. I just wanted a high quality cd for what i paid money for. In some instances i did get that with ""Because of You"" obviously been a hot track and i even like ""Crazy"" feat Jay-Z to an extent as well. But i just couldnt get into almost have the cd. Ne-You has the skills as far as songwriting and vocals. But I just was not feeling tracks 3,4,5,7 or 8. Can We Chill, Do You, Addicted, Ain't Thinking About You and Sex With My Ex (not really sure what was going with this one at all). The others i listed above i didnt really hate but i just know that Ne-Yo has better to offer in my opinion. Others might love those tracks i listed and thats fine. I also liked Leaving Tonight, Angel, Make It Work and Go On Girl (should be the next song) however. ""Because of You"" is a pretty decent cd for the most part. But for me decent just isnt really enough."
3,"OK CD, NOT GOOD AMAZON","The CD ok, borderline boring, but I only bought it for one song anyways. Call it an impulse buy. The only issue was that it had a TARGET sticker on it and had 2 scratches on the case. NEW PRODUCT? NOPE."
3,3 1/2 Stars 4 Effort but Definitely not as Good as his Debut,"Ne-Yo coming back with his sophomore album ""Because of You"" in my opinion was a rushed album. If he would've took more time with the album, it would've probably came out stellar just like his debut. The album isn't terrible, but you do hear a lot of Prince-influenced vocals on ""Addicted"" and another track and that was disappointed because we all know that Ne-yo is original and some of that was missing from the album. The album was consistent enough with good tracks, you have to skip around to find them but he'll still pull in his numbers. 3 1/2 Stars...Standout tracks: ""Because of You"", ""Do You"",""Leaving Tonight feat. J-Hud, ""Work It Out"""
1,No laurels for this show,"I only watched the Laurels are Poison episode so I can't speak for the others but, this is pretty bad. The relationship between the chauffeur and Lady Bradley is too casual yet too platonic to believe , the motive for the murders weak. The ending is also too weird for me. Not to mention I had it figured out long before the end. If you are a fan of Suchet's Poirot or Joan Hickson 's Miss Marple, you will find this not up to par. Too bad because Diana Rigg is so fun to watch. But even she doesn't save this shabby mystery."
4,Wow...,"If you're some speed freak constantly looking for new heights in grindcore depravity, look no further. I originally found this in my local mall, (hah) browsing for an Exodus CD. When I caught a glimpse of ""Gore Metal,"" I was intrigued. I mean, just look at it. When I placed it on the checkout counter, the clerk looked at me like I was insane. If there's a better sign of a great album, I'd like to know what it is.There's not alot to say here. The guitars literally sound like chainsaws, appropriately enough. The bass is pretty much drowned out by the overwhelming drums, and the vocalist's scathing grunts reach subterranean levels. Though brisk tempo changes run amock, the music here isn't exactly enviable in its virtuosity. Exhumed pride themselves on brutality, and strong grooves. ""Deathmask,"" ""Limb From Limb,"" among other classics, are highly infectious. Exhumed's ""Gore Metal"" doesn't exactly propel metal into a new level of subtlety,but it gives what it promises.- Thus says the Pellington"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I spend a lot of time at a desk and working with a PC and often catch myself doing some major slouching, which carries over into other activities. I tried a simple shoulder brace years ago but found it very uncomfortable after a few hours because it would constantly ride up my back. I've seen others that definitely would not do that but they are either very ""heavy"" looking, or expensive, or both. I decided to try out this item because it looked lightweight yet still anchors across the chest, and was very reasonably priced. I've been pleasantly surprised at the amount of shoulder/posture support it offers while being relatively comfortable. Anything of this nature will likely start to chafe after a while, but it takes this one a lot longer to become only slightly uncomfortable, particularly if worn over an undershirt, rather than against the skin. I'm going to order another to have a spare, but will try the medium since the small is a bit too tight across the chest for me."
2,Duro-Med Posture Corrector,"My doctor suggested that I get a posture correction brace for back pain. This product was very tight and uncomfortable. I thought it was because I needed a larger size, which I ordered. (Original product is not returnable, so now I have two!) The second one was no better. It shaffed under my ars, cut into the skin under my breasts, and was difficult to put on. the cure was worse that the back pain!"
3,Great reminder,"I would have to say that this is more for pulling your shoulders back than anything which does work well for that. It seems for slouching over it only serves as a reminder that its there and in the end, you really have to correct your own slouching (posture) with this."
4,Carol J.,"The posture corrector gently helps your upper back especially when your in a tedious posture position, prep cooking, cleaning, gardening, etc."
3,Its ok,I have horrible posture and a desk job. This support does correct your posture very well. It would be perfect if the straps did not cut into your armpits.
1,REFUND,"I have had problems with my posture for many years and I thought this would be an inexpensive way to work towards correction, standing straight is painful. This did absolutely nothing for me, there was not enough support. It was more like a reminder to stand straight... didn't need a reminder, needed assistance. So today it's back in the mail."
4,Russian Folk Gone Euro-Pop,"Yamboo, better known for it's Spanish-tinged Euro-pop gems, has delved into another part of Europe for musical ideas - Russia. This time they have taken the famous Russian folk song KALINKA and turned it into a piece of dance floor delirium. It is a cute song that begins with the well-known chorus of ""Kaaaaa...linka, Kaaaaaa.....linka, Kalinka....."", then builds into the happy beats of a bubblegum Euro tune. The only real downside to this song is the repetivness. There is only about 20 seconds of the song in which they don't say ""Kalinka""......it is a refreshing departure in which the girls sing, ""There's a party tonight, and the moment is right....."". But soon after that bit ends, it returns to the repititious ""Kalinka, Kalinka, Kalinka...."" Overall, this is a good, bouncy little dance tune that I recommend if you already know of Yamboo and their usual formula."
1,Scrapbook Plus,I brought the software beleiving that it would help me with my scrapbooking. It has very limited graphics and templates to workwith. I would not recomend this software package. Also the journaling sucks as well. Even when you start a product from scratch the software isn't user friendly with very little guidence. As stated before 1 star is to much.
1,#1 Fan Metal License Plate,"Not Really Happy On This Purchase. I Shop Here From Time To Time And Was Very Happy With Your Service. This Time Around I Purchased The Item Above And Received The Same Team Plate But It Was Way Different Than The Picture I Thought I Was Getting. I Tried Numerous Times Trying To Get A Hold Of Someone @ Amazon, But Came Up Short. I Called The # That The Invoice Had. They Stated "" That Amazon Messed Up And We Didnt Ship That To You And That They Have Been Doing That From Time To Time"" So Now What Am I To Do? I Know Its Not A Big Price Purchase But Still. "" I Kinda Wanna Get What I Payed For "" Ya-Know "" I Still Have It In Its Original Shipped Package Put Aside. It Was A Gift. So If You Whoever Get's A Chance To Read This, Please Let Me Know What To Do??? Im Still Gonna Shop Here, But Crossing My Fingers It Dont Happend Again Because I Really Like What You Guys Have To Offer. Thanks For Your Time - Alfonso Garcia"
3,"If you can see them, they can see you too.......","My wife and I bought this because we wanted to be able to see our kids when they are crawling through it. We figured that this way we could tell if they were 'up to no good'. When it arrived, we let our children began to play with it. They were a little hesitant to crawl into it at first, but we expected that. We then started placing them in there. They would just sit and look out at us instead of crawling through. We would lay down at the open end and call to them, but they just wouldn't move. Finally, I realized that they weren't really sure what to do BECAUSE they could see through it. I tossed a blanket over the top of it, and they instantly started crawling in and out of it without hesitation. I think that once they get the hang of it, we may no longer need the blanket, but that remains to be seen. In the meantime, I would recommend purchased one that is not see-through."
5,Best UGF Plate,"If you are going to use a UGF this is the plate you want. Cheaper ones break apart easily when vacuuming and do not have even flow. These Perfect-a-Flow Undergravel Filters are sturdy and have small openings close to the uplift tubes. The openings get larger as they are farther away. The design evens the flow. Contrary to what people say, I never had to remove the plate and clean underneath. I have had these in the same tank for over a decade and the fish flourished."
5,Awesome,"hard to belive that such a small LED bulb could produce such a bright beam. Only thing I didn't relize when I urchased this light is that it is not rechargable, nor does it plug in. It uses 4 ""C"" cell batteries that last for hours. Light stays cool and was very impressed for the price."
4,Only bought it,Bought it for the ice cream maker which did not make ice cream since then sitting in the fridge.
4,I respectfully disagree with the other poor reviews,"This CD, in my opinion, has 11 good songs out of 26. There is a lot of filler, so I can see why some people have given harsh reviews. However, how often do you get 11 good songs on a CD? Programming this while listening to it is recommended as some of these songs can get repetitive for sure. However, the good songs can be absolutely tremendous. Superb.For example, on CD#2 songs #2,3,9 & 12 are unbelievably fantastic.My advice: Buy the CD, listen to it a few times and mark the songs that you like with a pencil on the back of the CD so you can program it the next time you listen to it. If you program the top 10 songs, it can sound like the best CD you will buy this year."
4,Masterful As Always!,"For his third DGG recording of Beethoven's marvelous ""unbuttoned"" eighth symphony, Karajan spares no detail. Though the overall performance and magnificent rhythmic pulse and drive of the '62 Berliners is still unbeatable, here you get the full benefit of digital recording: those horns are unveiled and distinct! Karajan almost pulls off topping himself on this recording - but then comes the finale! The fourth movement has some regretable changes of tempo that I found slowed down its marvelous rush to completion. Von Karajan has done this in other recordings: worked to his advantage in the Eroica, particularly. However, his revisitings of the overtures are sterling - flawlessly precise and dynamic in only the way Von Karajan and his Berliners can be: expressiveness of feeling always tempered by steely technique! True Germanic perfection."
5,Great info!,This book was a gift from a friend and it's wonderful. As a new author--one without a book in print--I found the information on how these authors landed their first book sale very encouraging and interesting.
3,Toniiiiii!!!!!,"Toni is a beautiful Black woman with a beautiful family. Mind you she has a beutiful voice and does not need all the over synthesized beats and overdubbing! I feel she tried too hard to be like all of the others, forgetting she is far above. I have all of her albums and this one kind of disappointed me! Not to mention the the pictures inside....TONI!!! she needs to put some clothes on and realize she has two sons and a husband and she is not one a CIARA or Tiara Marie.....she can keep her clothes on and still sound great! and please stop with all of the artificial music, her voice is so beautiful, there is no need for that!"
4,Still Ssssssmokin',"Toni Braxton returns to the music scene with her impossibly deep and smoky contralto tones intact and firing on all cylinders. This is obviously not a woman who raises her voice a lot, even when handling her boys Denim and Diezel, who probably stop acting up as soon as Mom purrs at them.With six Grammy's under her belt, the Maryland-born clergyman's daughter doesn't disappoint, except for the length of the album. However, hunt for a copy with the bonus tracks ""Suddenly"" and ""Long Way Home"" and you're home free. (The UK version has the bonus tracks)This is a strong return, following 2002's ""More Than a Woman"", not counting the two ""collection"" albums in between. First single ""Please"" is an upbeat R&B; pleaser, but my pick is single number two ""Trippin' (That's The Way Love Works)"", the best track by a long shot.A solid album, and a must for all Braxton and R&B; music fans everywhere.Amanda Richards, October 3, 2005"
4,Nice Effort,"This is a nice CD from Toni. However, it is a little too short. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this CD."
2,Another step downward,"This series has declined steadily since Vol. I, a collection I enjoyed greatly... which is why I've stuck it out until now. The story is weak, the art is crude... there really isn't anything here I can point to that I think is very good.I really dislike panning things, but this installment in the 'Striker' series deserves to be panned. It's also the last volume I will be purchasing."
4,Enjoyed it,"I had never heard of John Weyman before reading this book, but doing a little research on him I found he was known as the ""Prince of Romance"". After reading this book I understand why. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone liking adventure and romance."
1,Inconsistent at best,"Like I said, inconsistent at best, which makes it worthless as a measurement tool. Sometimes it would be way off, sometimes I couldn't get a reading at all. It was accurate at times, as compared with my pen-style car tire gauge, but if I always have to get a second opinion on its readings, there's no point in using it."
5,Side tinted Air Deflector Review,The air deflecters I purchased from Weathertech via AMAZON were very good quality and I recommend them to everyone. I did have a problem with the rear window deflects because when I slightly opened them to let the hot air out of the truck (I live in Phoenix) I didn't notice one of them fall out of the window so I will be ordering another set for the rear window and find out where I made the mistake in installing them. Front set has set in well and is permanent. Again I highly recommend Weathertech products for anyone needing a high quality accessory for their vehicle.Michael Walsh (Phoenix AZ)
2,Bum rush,"A disappointing release that has very little depth. The emotion is not there. Too rushed and frantic. /Beethoven, particularly his symphonies, are, to me, like a fine wine to be tasted and held in the mouth for full enjoyment. With this album I feel like I'm sitting in a good restaurant and being rushed through the meal. This is the second Beethoven's 5th/6th symphony album I have by Karajan, and I'm not impressed. Both of them seem to me as though he is saying, ""let's just get this recorded and go home."""
3,Another word on the wonderful fifth.,"I still stand by the review below, but must recommend that you give the Giulini/LA Phil recording first consideration. After becoming more familiar with the recordings mentioned, and acquiring two others(Ashkenazy/Philharmonia, and Bohm/VPO), the Giulini easily rises to the top of the heap. The Karajan still punches harder and gets louder, but the other has so much more depth. You really need to hear this."
3,usb high speed,for twenty five dollars this baby works alright. I have a usb wireless adapter hook up to it.
5,The best,These are my fave crackers! So good. Dip them in Guacamole or cottage cheese! Very crispy and healthy. A staple in our house.
3,Up-date on I'm gonna get you Sucker with a Language twist,this Film is a trip.I can Relate to Pootie Tang because I got my OWn Slang.I Create my own Words all the time.now the film was a trip.I ain't that Big on Chris Rock except for His Quick Witted Quotes&things.Wanda is a Riot.She is like a Up-Dated Marsha Warfield for Me.not on the Level of Rudy Ray Moore style Based Films which this Film to Me seems to Be based on.DoleMite Classics.this is a Cult-Classic.
4,Dat movie was poison...,"Pootie was tyin' the clow through the whole movie man. Ya' boy Bob Costas was in it to keep it fresh for us white people, and the rest of the cast was keepin' it real. Seriously, most people didn't get the movie, and as a result, really missed out on a movie that puts itself in a catagory with Zoolander, with the added bonus of stripping off all the pop icons so we just see acting, not cameo after cameo."
1,#1 Worst Movie EVER,"All I can say is I'm against book burning, but I wouldn't object to seeing this piece of drivel go up in flames. Master reels and all so no one else would ever have to suffer through the lamest lampoon of blaxploitation ever released on humanity. Over dramatic in my description - maybe, but this film makes A Night at the Roxbury look like Academy Award material. That's how bad it is."
5,How can you not like this movie???,"It really saddens me to see how many bad reviews were written about this great movie. Yeah, it's not Shakespeare or any kind of movie that makes you ponder life. But it's freakin funny! Just for the sole hilarity of seeing Wanda Sykes as Biggie Shorty. Does it really get any funnier than seeing her on the street corner in her hot pants and head phones, rockin out? I don't think so."
2,Pootie Tang is ...,"This has to be one of the most stupidest movies I have ever seen in my life. There is not really a plot. There is nothing complex about this movie. It's like a SNL wanna be character made movie. I rated higher than a one because of the sdtrk and some spots were funny about 2-3. Through the entire movie I kept saying, ""Why did you waste you money on garbage."""
2,not funny,"This movie has it's moments, but they're all in the trailer! Perhaps this movie is a spectacular satire as some say, if it is, it is not an accessible one. Even Chris Rock wasn't funny."
2,"""OUR JOURNEY WAS THE DEVIATION""","In the months leading up to the Second World War, two women travel from Switzerland to Afghanistan to study an elusive nomadic tribe in Kafiristan. Writer Annamarie Schwartzenbach and researcher Ella Maillart embark on a journey that is both physical and emotional as they discover their own hopes and dreams. Unfortunately this film failed to capture my interest and was rather dull. Aside from the stunning cinematography of the Middle East and the (very) sexy Annamarie, JOURNEY TO KAFIRISTAN is a slow story with little insights of the human condition to offer the audience. I hesitate to recommend this film to others."
5,"I Love You, Carlo!","This book transformed my approach to pasta making and sauces. It's a compact powerhouse with the author's charm and humor in abundant evidence. His exceptional knowledge and generous approach to teaching and explaining the process is outstanding. I now regularly make pasta instead of my machine gathering dust. Carlo makes the process approachable, and his friendly encouragement will have you enjoying pasta and exceptional sauces. His mantra is quality ingredients and classic techniques, not complicated or inaccessible recipes. Worth it for the sauce chapter alone if you want to purchase pasta."
5,Five Stars,"As a mother of a daughter, I thought this book had a lovely message. I highly recommend it for anyone with children.Debbie Farmer, parenting columnist and author of 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat!'"
1,Not worth it...,"I bought this box thinking it would help with the ease of cleaning it out but i was mistaken. Like others have said, the litter clumps on the grate and i still have to scoop (scrape) clumps off the sides and bottom of the box. I did not have a problem putting it together, nor did i have a problem with litter leaking all out. The space inside is very small for a cat and my cat's body practically hangs entirely out of the box when he uses it. The kitten doesn't have trouble but he is still very small. I have to empty it at least twice a day and it smells."
2,Self Cleanning Litter Box From Omega,The litter box does not work as advertized. It says to roll it over and the clumped litter will fall into the collection container. Well it does not go into the container. You have to scoop it out yourself which is very inconvenient. Would not recommend this product. It is no better than a regular litter box that you have to take the litter lumps out of.
3,Tweezerman is awesome but buy the full size tweezers.,I am a tweezer fanatic because I get hairs on my face. Yep gross but it's true . I have like 10 pair of tweezers and i was excited to get these. They do work good just not as well as the full size pair.
3,this is good...,"but if you want a jaw-droppingly intense and stunning interpretation of the brahms violin concerto, check out her latest recording with kurt masur and the new york philharmonic. her growth as an artist has to be heard to be believed. this interpretation of the violin concerto is absolutely staid and nondescript in comparison to the later recording."
2,"Good story, not enough dancing, too mature-oriented for kids","I really liked the story, it's a different take on Tchaikovsky's original story line, with a much better core and ending. Most of the characters were well-developed and likeable, but with the exception of Barbie/Odette and Odile which I think needed a bit more depth and character.The motion-capture performed by NYC dancers were exceptional, but the disappointment was that there was actually very little dancing.The character models did not seem age-appropriate, it was something for more mature or teen audiences, I would definitely not recommend this as a kids movie, especially young girls who can get the wrong impression about thinness.The computer rendering of the scenes seemed rather poor for a movie produced in 2003, there was also an major absence of shading/shadows which was very noticeable."
3,Very good,"This is a very good adaptation of the superb Tchaikovsky ballet, with an entertaining story and vivid characters. The gorgeous music and ballet theme make this movie a MUST for all aspiring ballerinas. The graphics are beautiful, though the animation in all Barbie movies is fairly primitive. Also, don't miss our favorite Barbie movies: Princess and the Pauper and Rapunzel."
1,Would not play.,DVD would not play. We tried 2 dvd players. My granddaughter was crushed on Christmas morning. Returned for full refund.
2,Not quite what it appears...,"Unfortunately, this game does not offer ""Total Immersion"", or what the box says.First off, I'm still trying to figure out how to get 24 cars on the track at the same time (I've only managed 18), perhaps that is something I need to unlock.To me, ""immersion"" indicates simulation. Why? It means something that makes you feel like you are actually there, to immerse yourself into the virtual world.There are really no crashes, no car damage (That i've managed to find yet????), and the graphics really aren't really all that pretty compared to some other games.I suppose if you are a fan of Sports Car GT, or Test Drive Lemans/24 Hours of Lemans, then this game should fit the next step up in gaming.But if you are like me, and in desperate want of an actual immersed racing experience, walk away... quickly."
2,From Back Cover,"Loner P.I. Sam Lassiter easily found the nanny who'd allegedly kidnapped her young charge. But Laurel Coleman was far from the dangerous, deceptive woman his client - the boy's father - had warned him about. Her arms held the boy lovingly and she begged Sam to believe her innocence. The trust in her eyes, the naivete in her kiss pulled Sam into a vortex of emotion. Emotion he couldn't allow, with the gun-toting client in their heels. Sam had no choice but to take Laurel and the boy on the run again. Except this time the tempting woman and child would make him face his deadliest enemy of all...Third in 43 Light Street: Mine to Keep trilogy"
1,What A Piece of Junk!,"Shame on Mattel for selling such a poorly designed and flimsy toy. Ten minutes out of the box and I have already decided to take it back tomorrow morning! As the previous reviewer said, the arm on the bubble wand keeps coming off. The strap and suction cup provided are not strong enough to hold the vanity to the side of the tub. (And since this is battery operated, falling into the water would probably not be good for the unit!) If you want Mermaidia toys, stick with the dolls and avoid this one!"
1,Barely like toilet reading!,"First of all, it's by Dreamcatcher, your first clue its going to suck! Secondly it sucks! Thankfully, I saw this in the $1.99 bin which is about all the enjoyment you'll find here. The game is also impossible without a walkthrough, it really that bad! Wait until someone gives it away"
3,Decent Adaptation,"We liked this, but there were certainly times when our daughter (8 years old) had to cover her ears and close her eyes. The effects are a bit scary at times. So I would recommend this to an 11 year old, perhaps. But the story was engaging, just like the books are."
3,Good but not the best Harry Potter.,"Well if you are in to the Harry Potter series, this movie needs to be watched. It certainly has a more childish and not quite so dramatic appearance though. ON the bright side this makes for a very enjoyable watch.I would recommend this particular DVD because it comes with so many extras for so low a price. (Although getting it in Widescreen would be even better)"
3,Adventures galore....unreal!,"It appears that these Harry Potter movies appeal to all ages. I know two adult males who go to all of them. As do my young children. However, with so much suspense and complicated plots, they are better suited to pre-teen and young adults.Being one of the very few adults who have not read a single Harry Potter book, I was certainly not prepared for such an onslaught of scary situations and monsters as this movie put forth. I usually can take a lot of mysterious scarriness without being bothered, but some of this was so gross I wondered how on earth the people watching the movie as I did could sit there and put their little children through that horror. And whether these children would have nightmares for weeks (perhaps months) to come.Parts of this movie was enjoyable and entertaining. But I would never take my seven-yr. old grandson to see such violence.The flying car was fun to watch, shades of Chitty Bang Bang and Stars Wars special effects crammed together."
1,Fail for Computer Users,"Hope you don't want to watch this on a computer, because this film (and other early harry potter films) come pre-loaded with the Interactual player, an effort to prevent pirating/limit access disguised as a means of accessing special features. Interactual is bad software in and of itself (it sends information about how you use it out to the content creator without notifying you) but it's also not compatible with Windows Vista or 7, and the DVDs are set up to block you from viewing them on a computer using any player but Interactual. While it's installed, it will mess up the graphic display on your other players, and even if it's uninstalled, the DVD will halt playback or only play without sound. There's no available fix for this and they don't even still make the Interactual player."
3,My review considering I've seen the movie....,"The movie was great. Once. After that, it is not a DVD I would buy. Harry Potter books are much better than the movies. I have a full selection of the books. I have one DVD the rest of my family watches!"
2,something wrong,The extended version has trouble keeping the vocals aligned with the actors. I don't think we've ever been able to see the extended version b/c to get the vocal & acting together we stop the movie and go to scene selection and it bounces back to the original version. The behind the scenes is very well done.
1,Streaming rental has real problems,"We rented this movie for my daughter and her friend for their sleep-over movie. The download did not work. It kept stopping and really ticked off our daughter and her guest. I had to resort to streaming the movie from one of those free illicit sites........It is so sad that a free illegal service works better than a legal paid service. Amazon, please get your act together on this. We had to stop using I-Tunes because the sound would never sync up with the action when streaming a rental. We don't go to the free illegal sites to cheat anyone out of their $, we just want something that works. Looks like we will be sticking with free sites for a while. You know what would be awesome? If Amazon actually read this review, fixed the problem, and then contacted us to let us know it has been fixed. If it actually happens, I'll update this review. Will it happen? Stay tuned!"
3,Not as good as the first,"I really liked the first Harry Potter movie but I felt this one just doesn't live up to that. Harry really is a poor excuse for a wizard. He really doesn't know how to do anything. Things just happen for him. He's really lucky. The bird flies in just at the right time. The sword appears just at the right time. The car arrives just at the right time. Harry controls nothing. Everything just conveniently shows up. I think the story is very weak, often confusing, and often boring in this movie. It's just not what I was expecting."
4,Very Good Watch!,"I really enjoyed The Chambers of Secrets. The script was mostly good, but the actors and actresses were great! They really bring the books to life! I do have a couple of complaints however. One is about the scene in Knockturn Alley. The whole point of the scene in the book was Harry witnessing the Malfoys selling some of their illegal magical items, but since the Malfoys didn't appear in this scene, it didn't really make a lot of sense. My other complaint was I was really looking forward to the scene where Harry, Ron, Fred and George were degnoming the Weasley garden, but unfortunately that scene wasn't filmed. Other than these, I really enjoyed Chamber of Secrets, especially the scene where Ron attempts to curse Malfoy after he insults Hermoine, and because of his broken wand, his spell backfires!"
4,The magic of Harry Potter,We purchased this DVD for our grandson. He seems to be delighted and thrilled with the storyline which pleases us to no end.
5,Good entertainment,"The second movie of the second book of the Harry Potter series is as fun as the first one. The visual effects are really nice, such as the Dobby character and the Quidditch matches. The casting of the new characters are really fitting, too. It is one of those movies that you sit and enjoy either wit or without the kids."
1,not very good,"when I went to the theatre to watch this, I thought it was going to be very good, because I thought the first movie was good. I was surprised that they tried to ake it into an action movie. I just don't think Harry Potter and action goes together."
5,Better than the first!,"Okay, I'll admit, I wasn't too crazy over the first Harry Potter movie. Sure, it was pretty nice when it first came out, but it isn't one of those movies that I'll watch over and over again.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets definitely is a movie I could watch over and over again.The acting is brilliant. It doesn't look fake; it looks very realistic, as if this were a real life scene and not a movie. The spell effects are awesome. Not once does the movie get boring. Each scene kept me staying on my seat to see what happened next when I first saw the movie. Moaning Myrtle (sp?) was adorable. I like her a lot. The basilisk is definitely the coolest creature ever! The giant spider Aragon (Sorry, can't spell for my life) is very neat too. Actually, that whole scene in the forest is awesome.All in all, I found this a great movie with plenty of action, a dash of mystery, great actors and actresses who make the movie seem real, and neat special effects that don't look phony."
5,Love it!!,Have the first six movies in ultimate editions love that they made the first 2 in extended editions wish they had done that for the rest but they didn't so I'll love what I have.
5,Awesome,After my previous copy got scratched I needed a new one for my collection. This movie came promptly and worked perfectly.
5,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" looks as exciting as the first movie ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"", or perhaps better. I've seen the trailer for it, and the flying car seems to be one of the things in the movie I'm looking forward to the most. I can't wait to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione take on the task of getting into the Chamber of Secrets and Moaning Myrtle will be an edge to the plot. I can't wait till the movie comes out!"
4,excellent version of a good novel,"While there were many things that were missing from this movie that were included in the book, you will not notice their lack. As far as following the main storyline of the novel and the dialogue, it is an excellent carry over.If you enjoyed the novels or the first film, then this is a must see."
4,Awesome,Harry potter never gets old. I have watched all the movies at least 4-5 times but the magic never ends. It is fun to go back and watch the earlier movies and see Daniel ratliffe and the others as little kids and then watch them grow up again through the movies.
5,Great video,This was a great movie. Download was good with no issues. Will use service again. . . . . .
4,Missing Scenes,"Warning, this rerelease does not have all the scenes in it for some reason. For instance, when Harry uses flue powder to get to Diagon Alley and ends up in that strange shop, it does not show the Malfoys coming into the store. There are other missing pieces, too. I do not see an extended edition anywhere, so I can only assume these scenes have just been left out. Does anyone know differently?"
3,"Passable, But Not up to the Original","Not as awe inspiring as the first film, the introduction to the Potter mythos, this film returns to that world decently. However, a distraction was the fact that the primary kid actors have aged quite a bit beyond their original roles. It's quite startling watching the second film then checking out the `Hogwarts First Year' section and seeing them much younger. Too bad they couldn't do a Lord of the Rings and do as many films as possible quickly, heh. Still, the effects were a lot better. The basilisk was better CGI than the firsts three headed dog and ogre thing. Decent matinee fair, but nothing to seek out like the Two Towers and likely a disc I won't buy for my collection."
1,Horrible,"First off, the storyline for these movies are horrible, and the books aren't exactly much better.The acting is horrid, I don't know why they even wanted to use some of the lead actors in this movie, they were 100% horriblePlease, pass on this movie. You can use your time with something more worth it."
4,Intruiging and creepy!,"This Harry Potter installment has more story, more intrigue. The conflict Harry has concerning his ""true nature"" is very effective.The young actors all give fine performances, and the special effects are top notch. Some of the ""creatures"" may be too intense for very young children.A must for any fantasy DVD collection.Jeff Messenger, author of the novel ""The Shroud of Torrington."""
5,A Freshman Debut of Varsity Caliber,"Vivian Green's debut album is definitely a must have. I first heard her sing as the opening act on the D.C. leg of Maxwell's ""Now"" tour. She was phenomenal. It was a perfect appetizer to a wonderful show that followed. As for her album, Vivian Green is near perfect at offering an original sound and vibe. There is never, at any point on the album, a time when one will need to press the forward button. Simply said, she deserves all the accolades she is sure to receive."
2,Will the real music lovers please stand up?,"What happened to all the real music lovers? I can't for the life of me understand why this CD is getting such rave reviews for such shallow material. Granted, she has a good voice, which, with the right material, has the potential to be a great voice. But this...just ain't cuttin' it. Emotional Rollercoaster is a fine, solid release but there really isn't much more before or after that. Maybe it's just me. I tried, I really tried to like it but, on her best day, this could never hold a candle to Jill Scott. If you want some real music check out Rahsaan Patterson or Tommy Sims. I guarantee you can't go wrong with them."
4,Solid R&B with Jazzy Undertones,"Ms. Vivian has no reason to be ""Green w/Envy"" of any of today's Black female artist. Sista can hold her own! The tracks on this CD are smooth...created for your continuous listening pleasure.Vivian once said on TV that Sade is one of her all-time favorite artist. Well, hopefully like Sade, if Ms. Green can stay away from the radio copycats w/the same ole recycled productions, I'm sure she'll have the same longevity that a bright, mature artist deserves."
4,enjoy your first helicopter !,"simple, aesy to use, start with this model, before to take a bigest one if you like it !!"
3,early release of book,"I thought the overall story was well written, but I was disappointed that the book was published before all the sentences were handed down. It left me wondering and curious as to the fate of Dana and Che. Another mystery is the fact that the book I bought has a 5th picture on the front of a boy who from the best of my knowledge is not in the story at all. Who is he? I purchased this book at Lambert Field gift shop, St. Louis, MO"
3,The Devil Wears Levi's,"I remember this story from back in the early 90's as one of those crimes that makes you cringe and at the same time makes one wonder where in the world did these kids come from. Well, it all started right here in my own home state of Kentucky. Known for fast horses, great bourbon, and a winning basketball team, Kentucky also is famous for many crimes that baffle the mind. This was one of those such crimes. A group of teenagers living in a small town with nothing to do but dream of becoming vampires and eventually doing the unthinkable...being involved in a gruesome murder. This book is very descriptive in telling how these kids drifted into a world of blood lust and falling under the spell of the groups ring leader and head ""vampire""."
1,Don't waste your money,Might as well buy a piece of elastic and make one yourself. I never felt like it was strong enough to pull my shoulders back.
2,Not up to expectations,I ordered this product because my posture isn't perfect due to the fact that my spine wants to curve which is directly due to my age. I hoped that it would help me to pull up and back my shoulders which in turn would straighten my spine. It does NOT do any of that. It is simply 2 elastic armholes with bra strap closures attached that have 3 rows of hooks that may be adjustable to a man but certainly not for a woman. Thus NOT one size fits ALL!
2,Just so so,"Well, it sounds quite good from the product discription, and that was why I bought it. But after trying it on several times, I find although it is called Neck and Shoulder Massager, it can not do much to the shoulder and the massage is only done by simple vibration , which comes with the low frequency noise and makes me dizzy after 5 mins. Whenever you turned on the heat option, the strength of the massage gets weaker and the dimension of this thing is too big for asian people and not convenient for travel."
4,Better Than Good,"Hans Zimmer, of ""Video Killed The Radio Star"" fame, has put together an eclectic group of songs from the award winning movie, ""As Good As It Gets"". From country to meldodic standards to pop and on. This music fits all mood swings. Laughing....with this movie it was a requirement.I really liked the way the music fit different parts of this quirky but heady movie. When Jack Nicholson is trying to tell Helen Hunt he loves her--he plays Nat King Cole's, ""I Love You--For Senteminental Reasons"" and had discs prepared with all sorts of music for a drive a threesome takes to Baltimore.We hear Art Garfunkel's, ""Always Look On The Bright Side of Life"" sung by Jack as he attempts to get his neighbor's dog to eat--it works!!A good soundtrack from a good movie.I appreciate your interests & comment votes--CDS"

I understand that each persons body functions a little different, but this product did absolutly nothing, but change my moods. I suggest you save your money and join some form of exorcise program. They also offer a money back program. They never returned any of my emails and they never returned my voice mail. Can you say SCAM!"
1,It made me hungrier,I don't think it is strong enough. It actually INCREASED my appetite!Save your money
2,revision on the hoof,"with each edition the illuminati strives to change the language of the globe-- it doesnt even have the word monster in it, or human being for that matter. In the fifth ed. they mean each other-- nice specimen, just not what I ordered--FIFTH edition--by the time I got it it cost more to send back than it was worth to keep--17.00 us fake money. so i begrudgingling kept it.not happy amazon!! buttholes!!!"
3,Master P another hit album.,"Master P another hit album. there is alot of good tracks on the good side cd and the bad one is only two. But the good tracks are jeans,act like a fool and who them boys. His album gets 3 out of 5."
5,ooohhhh my god!!!!,"this is by far the best cd he has had. dont get me wrong, his other cds were hot but this cd is bad. lil jon has got some cold beats on this. if youre looking for some hard beats than look no further. definately buy this cd!!!!!!!!!!! if you dont than your gonna regret it."
3,Mexican Train,"Fun game. You can be entertained for a few hours. It can be for two players (it is fun) or more (much more fun), but not more than 6 because then is boring."
5,Dominoes for older women,My friends and I play Mexican Train on a regular basis and so these trains are used all the time. They arrived on time and they are holding up well.
1,Very boring,"Very boring movie, only the bear was good about it, you would have to pay me to watch again!"
3,I am a big fan of Norman's Gor Series,"I had to have the movie to complete my Gor collection. It is a campy badly acted movie set in the desert - probably filmed in California, which if you area fan of Gor you know that the world is a lush paradise - not an alien desert like every set of the of Star Trek Series. . . still. If you need to finish your collection, you might as well have it. Don't buy it thinking you're getting a good adventure movie."
1,Alternate Title: Planet of Stupid Headgear,That pretty well sums it up. Jack Palance must have been hungry when he got involved in these honkers.
3,Truely a Starter Kit,"Bought these for my brother to use at his workplace. From what I recall, the software was limiting and unwieldy. and the additional cameras were a bit expensive."
1,disappointing product,"I chose this product mostly for the claimed heat feature. But where is the heat? Hot water gets cold very quickly in the foorbath. The bubbling is also very mild. There is no control for either heat or bubbling.This thing also is not as quiet as claimed. There is a constant humming noise much louder than my ultrasonic humidifier. Considering the little this thing does (just a few wimpy bubbles), the noise is even more annoying. I am going to return this thing if I still can!"
3,"Okay, but could use some work.","I bought this for my wife and tried it recently. She liked it for the most part, but noticed that the water cooled down, when the box says that this machine keeps it warm. It took a while so it wasn't a huge inconvenience. Also, the motor for the pedicure wand is very loud.I liked it, but also noticed a kinda rapid cooling of the water temp. The bubbles are nice, and the motor that runs that part is fairly quiet.Worth purchasing, but not for $50+ that Amazon wants. Try to find it on sale. $30 seems like a better price."
1,Freakin' awful,"Do not waste your money on this thing. The packaging says with'heat,' but I have no idea what heat they are referring to as I filled the unit with water and let it run for 30 minutes and no heat happened. I then boiled water on the stove and filled the unit with that only to find out that it actually cools off very rapidly in the unit, presumably because of the cold air bubbles being pumped through it.The only positive review on this product was actually written by the company themselves. That's a shameless way to conduct business, and a disgraceful way to mislead the public."
1,Not Impressed,"The spa was rather noisy, not a relaxing sound to listen to. There is a horseshoe-shaped area where (mild at best) bubbles are suppose to come out. Only a third of the ring actually produced bubbles. While features like the handle are nice, the basic spa functionality is really lacking."
2,A Therapist's Response,"As a marriage counselor, I have some real concerns about this book. Mr. Gray states many things as facts which are merely his opinion. He says women are only interested in and capable of orgasm some of the time. (He uses this to argue for quickies for men in which women are to receive no satisfaction). In truth many women, myself included are interested in having an orgasm in every sexual encounter as all men do. A quicky feels the same to us as sex without orgasm would feel to a man. His book is heavily biased by a male viewpoint. There are a few good ideas but too many dangerous ones."
3,way off base,"The first book form Dr Gray was great! Matter of fact, I'm looking for a audio of it. This bedroom stuff is way off base.. Dr Gray forgets what the acts of love and respect women need."
4,not the golden rule,"No, it won't change your sex life overnight or turn you into ""the best in bed"", but it would shed light to the difference of how men and women view sex. It certainly will deepen your understanding for your partner and may help you becoming closer because of that extra knowledge nobody told you about."
3,Too much sexual technique for my martian taste,"The tape was good to listen to for some tips on how to improve the sex life of martians and venusians. Some of the ideas are ok, but really if you were to practice these ideas literally...I would not recommend it to anyone. But it is good as a guideline. Keep open for other suggestions out there though."
1,Gray Should Take Biology 101...are there minus points?,"Gray must know nothing about the tremedous sexual capacity of women.He needs to take a few lessons in female anatomy before he can write such an insulting,mysogamous text. The message is 'women need to be romanced,loved, swayed,talked into sex' while men are viewed as the 'natural aggressors and instigators of sexual relations and have a hydrogen bomb explosive sex drive at all times...wrong! 1..wrong! WRONG! ""Dr."" Gray!"
1,Bane is Lame,"If you're going to make a piece of crap like this a little skin would have been nice just to keep the viewer's interest. It seems like someone found a warehouse or sound stage and made some fake walls out of fencing and bed sheets. The story although weak had you wondering what the heck are we watching and why are we still watching it? I will give any movie a chance, but this one really needs to be burnt and buried. If you really feel like you need to watch it, rent first."
5,best camera ever!,I have taken shots I never thought I would get!! It's got a lot to offer. This combination covers just about everything. It's great... that's about all I can say.
5,MY Scene Just Keeps Getting Better and Better!,Swappin Styles-gorgeousGoes Hollywood-swept us awaySecret Locker-amazingBLING BLING?---------- P - E - R - F - E - C - T !!!!!This Madison doll is super cute. I love the shiny outfits. Her hair is magical. This is the BEST Madison by FFFFFFFAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(not to say the others weren't good) MY SCENE FANS ARE GONNA LUV IT! I DO!
2,This Madison is kinda ugly,I love Madison but not this one.She is kinda ugly.Do you know what???I saw Bling Bling Nolee at ebay and she is so (...) beautiful.I dont want this Madison but my scene goes Hollywood Madison is perfect.(...)
4,Madison is Super Glamorous!,"I'm an adult collector but My Scene was introduced when I was twelve; my mom loved to buy these dolls for my sister and I, they seemed like the one thing she didn't mind splurging on every few weeks! I never got any of the dolls from the Bling Bling series, but now I have Madison and she is my favorite Madison doll ever. Her hair is beautiful and curly and her outfit is awesome! I love that out of the four dolls she is the only one not baring a midriff. Although she comes with a second two-piece outfit, her purple minidress is fantastic and super stylish. I love her boots as well (but Barbie's are my favorite). This Madison has a top spot on my display shelf, she is the epitome of a fashion doll."
1,Wrong message for children!,"I purchased this doll for my daughter because it's physical characteristics, hair and skin tone closely resembled my daughter.But before giving it to my daughter I had to buy extra clothes for the doll because the outfit on this doll is way too far on the side of the wrong message toy companies should be giving our children.I don't think a doll should promote sexuality or the focus on material ""BLING"" as this one clearly does.I should not have to re-dress a doll in order to make it properly presentable to a child of any age.And to my horror, when I opened the package to re-dress her...she has a belly button ring!Isn't our society in enough trouble without such marketing tactics thrown up as additional obstacles for parents to overcome?Sad for me, this was the only doll available at Xmas time that resembled a child of mixed race. I shouldn't have to settle for the dark doll or the white doll or the light-skiined doll with WAY too much sex appeal.Wrong message for children!"
1,Hootchie! Hootchie!,"This is a skimpy,cheesy clothed doll. The My Scene girls don't usually have this little amount of clothes on,and they look almost naked. This is not what young girls should be playing with,and they shouldn't even be seeing this!"
1,"Dude, PLEASE run a brush through her hair...","WOW. This dolls hair is so frizzy and ugly, when I first looked at it I thought it was a bush."
1,No more Barbies,"Hello, my name is Alexandrea Marie Anna Bunitorisua and i am reviewing this doll. I think that this doll is very ugly and wrong. What are toys trying to teach children these days?!? That it is fine to graduate schools? Girls should stay home and help their mothers until they are four teen, and then they get married and have children at fifteen. These dolls are very bad for young girls because they make it seem like girls can particapate in sports, which they cannot. That is my opinion and i hope you follow by it. its true. Girls aren't supposed to show their pudgy tummies, so i think these dolls are brainwashing little girls into wearing these things!"
4,Hi Sara Siblini!,"I'm Hannah's sister. I like Madison, and she's beautiful. I love her lips because they're sparkly. Her hair is poofy and durable. I love her extra outfit. It has my favorite color(purple). What else should I say? Oh yeah, I have a Native American skin color, sorta like Madison's color skin. That's why I like Madison so much. I love her shoes.From:Madison Bella (Natalie)"
5,AWESOME CD,"This CD is one of the best CD's I've ever purchased. If you're a Ray Charles fan, it's a must for your collection. Also, it's extremely hard to find in stores."
3,"Country, Country, Country...","My favorite part of this CD is the first fifty seconds of ""This Old Heart"". I was looking for recent blues work and discovered Ray Charles from Tony Bennett's ""Play'n With My Friends..."". I immediately wanted to hear more of that kind of Ray Charles, but this release is all C&W style. If you don't like the C&W style then you probably won't enjoy this. Not to say the performances aren't excellent. Next time i'll, bite the bullet and install RealAudio so that I can listen to the song samples BEFORE purchasing."
4,Well structured and concise history,"This is a well-written, seemingly well-researched and authenticated history of the region, people and cultures which combined to create the modern Hungary. This would be an excellent refernce for anyone planning travel to Hungary - whether for the first time or repeat vistis. It provides excellent context for many of the features Hungary in general offers and should be beneficial to the reader in engaging with the Magyar people."
2,This is concise as it says,The History of Hungary was definately concise. I did not get to stay in one time for very long and would have liked more information in some years of Hungary's history. But for the name of the book and the information it was an appropriate title.
2,Disappointed!,"We have The Black Stallion movie, along with the other 2 ""movies""; and thought this would be more of the same high quality. But this is taken from the TV series, and it just isn't as good.I would not recommend anyone spending the money on it."
5,What an eye opening book.,"I started reading this book and OH MY how this book defines what is happening in the US today. The definitions and origins of Communism, Marx, Fabianism, etc. are great. It makes me see how the US got from where we were yesterday to where we are today. Lost my copy in the midst of reading this book and cannot be without it!This is happening in the US today and it is SCARY!"
3,There was a movie made about this...,"If I am not mistaken, there was a movie made about this book in the early 90's which starred a very, very young Kate Beckinsale. Seemed to me it was her first movie. I couldn't remember the movie's title. Might be the same but ""The Flanders Panel"" doesn't ring a bell on me. Although I have not read this book (but I am giving it 3 stars based on the plotline), I would think reading the book is a lot better than the movie - which I personally think stunk bec of the acting. I rented the DVD from Blockbuster only bec I was intrigued by storyline synopsis.Watching the movie just ruined it for me before becoming aware that it was from a book."
4,A review too far down the list to be seen?,"Like ""Club Dumas,"" ""The Flanders Panel"" is better as a book-to-be-in-the-middle-of than a tale-with-satisfying-conclusion. But I think it is the fate of the 21st century literature fan to find most conclusions relatively unsatisfactory -- kind of unbelievable -- and to enjoy the ride rather than the destination.I agree with reviewers who wonder whether the translation delivers all the emotional and human context/connotation of the original, however."
2,Too fine,"The first 100 pages were quite a delight - there's a strong feeling of old-fashioned European intelligence in this book, as well as some impressing ponderings on the basic questions of existence. The beginning was also quite slow, and I thought the story would speed up towards the end, but as it is, this never happened.It seems to me that the author simply didn't know what to do with his ideas. The intelligence fades into snobism, the metaphysics go totally out of control, the plot drags on and makes in the end every page a battle you have to win. And the solution of the mystery... well, that was just unbelievable. And artificial.Two stars for the great European irony, which I prefer any day over American banality, and also for the chess-player Munoz, which I think was the only interesting character in the book. Did someone mention The Name Of The Rose? Well, there's a difference wider than the ocean between Spain and Italy..."
2,Is it better in Spanish?,"Unfortunately, The Flanders Panel is one of those novels that lure you in with a tantalizing and well-packaged premise, only to leave you wrecked on a disappointing shoal of overwrought cliches and characterizations that in their attempt to tittilate only manage to over-reach. The only thing resonating through it is a false note of itellectualism that at base is nothing more than obscure name dropping.Much of this may be forgivable if it weren't for the sad way in which Julia's dialogue renders her a pale spectre floating through her own starring role. Her words sound as though they were generated by writing software rather than a human being and I wonder how much of this owes to the translation as The Seville Communion feels so much more believable."
3,Good Idea; Mixed Execution,"The basic plot device is solid. A painting undergoing restoration is found to contain clues to a murder involving the subjects of the painting. This is paralleled by a modern murder mystery involving the restorer and her friends. The parallelism of remote and contemporary events is suppossed to evoke a Borgesian sense of archetypal destiny. Some of the plot development, involving a chess problem that adds an additional layer of complexity, is fairly clever. Character development, however, is relatively superficial. The ending is mechanical and contrived."
2,"Excellent beginning, poor follow-through","It's a fascinating premise and I loved the beginning of the novel, but unfortunately the rest of the book didn't live up to the first couple of chapters. In addition, there are a number of comments made about the psychology of homosexuality that are dubious at best and offensive at worst."
1,A sad waste of a fine premise,"When I first started the book I was captivated with what I took to be a refreshing old-world obliviousness to political correctness. And, I thought, amid such a promising intellectual atmosphere the stereotypes would surely deepen into real characters eventually. But instead the context flattens out to match the stereotypes. The mystery plots (both historical and contemporary) turn thin, the chess and musical analogies go off-key, and to find the conclusion at all persuasive you have to buy into some pretty nasty prejudices. Since the professional reviewers have overrated this so badly, for the sake of fairness I'm giving it only one star."
2,Not worth reading from an Anne Rice faithful,"I love Anne Rice but I must say that this is among her worst books. I found the tale common, predictable, boring, unrealistic. This book lacked Anne's usual feel, flavor, intensity, character development,the feeling that makes you stay up all night turning pages. I thought she turned it out in a short amount of time, without thinking. I read all of Anne Rice's books and would rate The Witching Hour among the best, this tale among the worst"
5,One of the most beautiful and enchanting books ever written,"+AH4-WOW! This book is so beautiful. Every Anne Rice book I read is better and better than the last, but Servant of the Bones is by far the best. In Azriel we have a new hero (to replace beloved Lestat), and a mixture of the old world with the new. The story spans ancient Babylon and Greece, and ends up in the modern U.S. It is all about Azriel, a young man condemned to remain a spirit, never finding the ladder to heaven, but redeeming himself nevertheless. The book is more than just a story,+AH4-+AH4- more than magic, it is also a commentary on the current state of the world.... and it is all said in beautiful poetic writing. What can I say, I absolutely loved it+AH4-"
1,Complete Twaddle!,"I'm sorry, but after wading through this, my first encounter with Ms. Rice, I don't think I'll bother with any more. It was like chewing cardboard. And what the hell was that 'Some Lamb' rubbish???"
1,Boring and plotless,"I read this book when it first came out, and I read it again recently and it doesn't get any better as I age. It is boring and has no plot. Oh and someone should tell Ms Rice the word is spelled ""Muslim"", not ""Moslem""."
3,Her next movie?,"Anne Rice uses the same technique as in her famous book ""Interview With A Vampire"".The story begins in today's time as Azriel tells his story so it may be put in print. Azriel begins with his death and the curse which turned him into the Servant of the Bones... his bones. It continues to tell of his Masters and all he learned from them.Somehow he is summoned in today's time to witness the murdering of a lady by three men with ice picks. Furious, he catches the three and kills them before she is fully dead and may know she is avenged. But WHO had summoned him? Why? Who was the Master?***Another winner for this author! I only wish she had changed her style some. It was TOO MUCH like Interview With A Vampire. I was enthralled through the whole story. Who knows? This will perhaps be her next movie.***"
2,Not her best work,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this novel. Rice did not seem genuine with the plot line and I was not convinced of Azriel's true purpose. It was an ungraphic and unillustrated attempt at one of her other genius stories. Bones was a simple and clear, while vague and unabsorbant, recapturing of one uninteresting young man's life. I know that I am not some rich and ingenius critic. I probably bear no leaverage at all with wether or not you read a book, but it feels better to vent. The possiblity that Ms. Rice will check this to see an unenthused response to her novel is a bit fetching."
3,Nothing beats audio for a mediocre book,"The audio tapes of Servant of the Bones had a heavy discount in the shop so I bought them almost on impulse. What a great idea!! It meant I wouldnt have to read such drivel!! In fact, listening to someone read the book is great and I really do feel sorry for all the people that had to put up with reading the story. And what a story!! It was going so well! I was really hooked! It was only towards the end after listening for over three hours that I realised Ms Rice must have suddenly given up on this book, given up on the plot, given up on the characters and just ended the whole build-up with a plot straight out of a mickey mouse comic; leaving me feeling bitterly cheated. How could you do it Anne? If I wanted this type of insult I would have watched an Austin Powers film. Dr Evil - at least HE is convincing!"
1,Boring and Awkward,"I am usually a HUGE Anne Rice fan, but I think that she has fallen too much in love with the sound of her own narration to really write a novel anymore. Same thing as in ""Memnoch."" She has lost her touch, and she does not hide it well because of the utterly stupid organization. She spends half of the novel showing off how well she can research Jewish history, and the second half milking a predictable, half-baked story. Please, Anne, go back to the world you were in when you wrote ""The Tale of the Body Thief"" or ""The Witching Hour."" Maybe her next book, ""Violin,"" will be better. Hopefully"
2,Not her best.,"Very disappointing: Well researched but boring. Flabby characterizations of polystyrene figures. After 50 pages I found myself thinking, ""But who cares?"" Skimming ahead roused no interest, so I finally gave the book away"
5,"As usual, a fabulous novel by New Orlean's premiere author","Anne Rice has a gift for describing past times, exotic worlds and deeply spirtual realms. Each of her books surpasses the last in its depth of human emotion and historical ambiance...a real winner."
2,WARNING WARNING WARNING,"This book is in DESCRIPTIVE NOTATION, not algebraic notation. Do not buy this book."
4,Sexy and Comfortable,"Very comfortable for vinyl, easy to wear. Sometimes the snaps don't feel like fastening securely"
4,One of the good Fulci films,"Not all of Fulci's films are amazing....in fact some of them are stinkers. However, this film stands out as one of the genre's best. I HIGHLY recommend also checking out Zombie (a.k.a. Zombi 2), The Beyond or City of the Living Dead. These are all classics that stand alongside horror's finest."
2,Sub-par Fulci.,"This movie is a hodgepodge, a gangly monster that ole Dr. Frankenstein would be proud of. It has a great score, good atmosphere and some great scares. However, the script feels like it was thrown together, failing to bring all of the usually bizarre Fulci elements together. Admittedly, Fulci's other films, such as THE BEYOND, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, and ZOMBIE, are wild and wooly but, at least the made sense in their own way. This one doesn't. You could drive a cement truck through some of the plot holes. The viewer is left abandoned in a maze of strange but ultimately empty and meaningless situations with no clue as to what to make of it all. It's sad that Fulci's finest period had to end on this sour note."
3,regarding [price] version,"First of all, good movie. Much gore, okay plot. Typical Amnityville storyline: good people + bad house = goretastic thills and bloody spills.Now, about the d.v.d. Problems were constant freezing throughout earlier part of movie. My d.v.d. player is almost two years, and I've never had a problem like this before where the counter was erased and disc was unable to be ejected. As it got into the movie, problems slowly went away; but back to the menu, problems occured again.Other than that the picture and sound were a 10. Definately worth the money if you can find a d.v.d. that doesn't have the curse. For the money, I'm sure a good 1 out of 3 probably have this problem. Is it worth getting the [price]. version? I don't think so, unless you have a passion for Fulci.But beware of the cheaper [price] version. Keep your receipt and buy it somewhere where it's easy to return."
2,Boring,"This film is just plain boring, as are most of Fulci's films infact. There is no atmosphere, the dialogue and some scenes are laughable(and not in a good way) and the dubbing of the main childs voice is incredibly annoying. The picture quality is pretty good for the price(certainly as good as Anchor Bay's release of Zombie) and the sound quality is also decent, although the music itself seems to burst in and dissapear at the most inappropriate times. The only reason it doesn't get 1 star is because there is some decent gore, although not enough to save it. I certainly won't be watching it again."
3,An Ok Fulci film but not one of his better films,"This was the first Fulci movie I saw that had no zombies in it. The movie was hard to follow, you never find out what the hell is going on until the end, and even then you are never given a full explaination. The basic story is a creepy old house where in the basement creepy Dr. Fruinstein lives and has to kill victums in order to regenerate his cells. Don't ask me what the hell that means cause that is one of the lines at the end of the movie to try explaining what is going on. All in all, I enjoyed it and is watchable again. It is not gory, I mean for Fulci, the gore is pretty average. Compared to some of Fulci's other films it is mild. If you want to see lots of the red stuff and and body parts, see Fulci's The Beyond. In my personal opinion, Fulci's greatest movie is Zombie. If you are a Fulci fan, House By The Cemetery is decent enough. If you are not a Fulci fan, you will not like this movie."
3,wasn't disapointed,"i wasnt expecting a whole lot from this one , already having a few of fulci's other zombie movies . they're all kind of guilty pleasures , i guess. this wasnt bad"
5,Monte can cruse with the BEST!,"Monte's CD ""Swingin' With Style"" is a real classic I have totally enjoyed listening to anytime of the day. I was not around during the Big Band era but I was lucky hear and see Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr live on stage and I will say it's a real pleasure to see Monte Procopio carry on with this great music. I have his CD and I hope Monte comes out soon with a new CD so I can have more great music to listen to. Monte, you a fantastic performer with a wonderful voice that I can listen to all day. Thank you ever so mush!!!!"
2,NEEDS EDITING,LISTS AT LEAST ONE FLY IN THE INDEX TO FLY PATTERNSTHAT IS NEITHER PICTURED OR DISCRIBED IN TEXT.SOME FLIES ARE PICTURED BUT ARE NOT TIED AND ARE DIFFERENT THAN TIED.
3,very nice but NO D RINGS,"when UPS dropped this off i was shocked to see NO D-RINGS - only handle. apparently there are TWO different models of the SKB130. and of course, every musician needs CASES WITH STRAPS!!! (or extra hands . . . ) i KNOW it doesn't come with a strap but the photo is of a case with D-RINGS FOR STRAPS."
2,Kitties hated it,"It was way smaller than expected and my kittens hated stepping on it so they would jump over it, which defeated the purpose of having it in the first place."
1,Doesn't Work,"My friend has this... it just doesn't work that well. I put an old ""rag rug"" in front of my kitties' litter box and that does a way better job."
2,cute but not what I needed,"I'm new to cats. We have hard wood floors and the litter gets everywhere so i decided to buy one of these due to the rating. It's cute but it really does not work well. At least not in the way that I expected. It seems to catch some litter, but by some, I mean a few pieces. I gave up and went to the hardware store. Bought a indoor outdoor carpet made of material that is threaded more like a door mat. I paid $10.00 for 3'x6', more then enough. Cut it down a bit and its perfect. I found the cats need more than this Omega Litter Mat to get their paws clean."
1,Sensationalist and foul,"I was expecting/hoping for something serious and educational, instead this was foul and overtly sensationalist. The language, male frontal nudity and violence within the first minutes of this movie let you know what trash it is."
1,The Weather Underground,"I saw the whole movie in parts online(utube) because I refuse to pay to watch it,as a self-proclaimed reactionary and rightwinger I could care less about a bunch of spoiled white kids thinking they can cause any change either by passing out flowers or in the case of the pathetic sds/weathermen or WU by intimidation. on the contrary whenever you get violent means from any group no matter the political stance you won't get a good response,the documentary is a look back at group that isn't important to history and is a stain on the anti-war movement and reinforces the belief that Liberal Fascism has existed and still exists. Professor Ayers and Dohrn should be in Jail, I wish I could have been in Law Enforcement myself to lock up the brats.Now no matter if your a washed up professor or lib,or progressive ,or Conservative or apolitical it's important you know the history of such scoundrels."
2,Porter at sea,"I'm a pretty untiring reader, as long as I have faith I'm in competent hands, but I gave this book up at page 160, which was enough of an investment to convince me that Porter was lost, lost, lost. I'm an admirer of her short stories, but all she's done in this larger form is expand the cast of characters, forgetting to give them anything to do. The characters are really only cartoons, which Porter seems aware of, since she doggedly gives us paragraphs and pages of analysis for most of them. But in a novel, characters define themselves by what they do, not by what they think about themselves, or what their creator thinks of them. The sheer number of them just hanging around listlessly becomes so unwieldly for Porter that you feel sorry for her -- you can almost hear her thinking, ""Wait, what about So-and-so, we haven't seen him come out of him cabin lately, maybe I'll have him get drunk and make a scene."""
3,Hibernation locked up the system,The hibernation locked the system. Power recycle didn't help in most cases.
4,Keeping it Real,"I have been strongly considering a position as a 911 Operator/Dispatcher and have had a hard time finding information regarding the ""real life"" of the job. This book was exactly what I needed! I enjoyed the author's practical information on her perspective of days in the ""Hot Seat"". Her inner thoughts on good days, bad days and those days where she adds a delightful sense of humor kept it ""real"". I could feel myself sitting in the comm center with her. This is an easy book to read and I had a hard time putting it down. I book marked some pages and have gone back to read them just to see if I could see myself doing this job.Now if you are looking for information to pass the test or other training information, this isn't the book. BUT I would highly recommend it to someone interested in the field, to someone who is already doing the job or to someone who just wants to know how someone on the other end of 911 felt."
5,Loved it!,I did this job for 25 years. Caroline Burau does an excellent job of describing the job. Throughout the book I kept saying 'yes!' I really enjoyed her writing style
2,Boring,I thought it would give more details on calls but it's prettu much this womans story wrapped around her job. I was a little bored and dissapointed with this book.
2,"Nice, but not what I ordered.",The Pooh sent to me had a non-removable Santa hat. This doesn't match the picture at all where it is a picture of Pooh with no sort of other decoration. As this is a Christmas present I don't have to to return it. I'm sure the little girl receiving it will still enjoy it but I will try not to order from this vendor again.
4,A nice reminder,This collection is a nice reminder of all the great music that Nash and Crosby made while on hiatus from the mighty CSN&Y. Every track a winner.
3,meh,It arrived right on time but didn't fix my flat tire :/ I would recommend just buying an inner-tube and teaching yourself how to change the tire. It's cheaper and more likely to work.
1,2 months old - heating element has failed,I've owned any number of VillaWare products in the past and have always been happy with their quality and longevity. This product has not lived up to that reputation - the heating element has failed on this unit after only about 6 uses in 2 months.
1,Died within a year. Villaware will not honor 3 yr warrenty,"I bought this unit in the hope that there was more positive feed back than negative. My mistake. The unit required to be turned all the way up and then after the ding left to cook one more minute. I could live with that procedure. Then one day I was making some waffles and in the middle of the second waffle the unit just quit. Lights are on but there isn't any heat. I called Villaware to take advantage of the 3 year warranty. They said the unit only has a 1 yr warranty. I read directly from the user guide on the back page ""3 year limit warranty"". Turns out that the ""limit"" is whether or not they want to honor the warranty.They were more that happy to offer me another unit for a price. Lovely.I'll pass on that and any other Villaware products from now on."
1,Broke after 8 weeks,"Reasonably good waffles (only on highest setting) for 8 weeks, then heating element broke. Two weeks beyond Amazon return policy."
1,Piece of crap..,"This is a good looking machine that makes great waffles, bur after using it 15 or 16 times the machine decides to call it quits. Really annoying, you're standing there with a huge batch of home made batter and a hand full of promises and you have nothing to show for. Why aren't there any decent waffle makers on the market?"
5,Fabulous!,We are really enjoying this waffle maker. We used the recipe in the book. It is all you need for breakfast! Very filling and yummy!
5,nice,Christmas on the Mountain: A Bluegrass Christmas nice we like it even if it's not the best music for the holidays
4,More a companion than a reference,"This book has been with me since before I left college, decades ago. I dip into it frequently, and the wisdom contained within always reveals something new. John Gross did a first class job of collecting--and referencing and indexing--all of these great quotes. This book, so rewarding in itself, is also a great introduction to many wonderful writers and thinkers. It's docked one star for having a slight cynical tinge--a few quotes from Tryon Edwards and a few more from Caleb Colton and Augustus Hare would have evened things up. Give this to your favorite brooding young person."
4,Love the camera and 7-300 lens,"Only the 28-80 lens brought the rating down. I shot with it; put the other lens on and haven't taken it off.First, this is the second refurbished camera I have bought from Carmeta. I have been extremely satisfied with them. Shipment was fast and complete.I can't say enough about the D80. What a camera!The 70-300 f/4-5.6 Di LD Macro AF lens has been a lot of fun. I can stand back 5 ft. from a flower bed (i.e. without stepping into bed!) and use the macro setting for a clear detailed image with excellent bokeh. Personally I have little problem hand-holding. We went birdwatching in Texas a few weeks ago and the 300 mm. zoom allowed for awesome pictures."
1,If you love classical music....,"If you love classical music, this is a good movie to buy. However, I had problems with the unbelievable storyline, the sterotyping, the lack of a noticable plot, and the main character (Paul) acting like crack addict with his mood swings between seducing older men to further his career. The sound quality was very bad unless the music was playing. At one point I found myself looking to turn on the subtitles (there weren't any) because it was impossible to make out the dialogue. This is a huge disappointment from TLA Releasing."
3,"Magnificent recording, but...","Everything the other reviewers have said is true. This recording can only be described in superlatives. However, the work is only 38 minutes long! That's less than half the CD! I grant that the picture on the cover is very cool, but you'll get more of your money's worth if you buy the set of Ravel, Debussy, and Saint-Sans from the Karajan Forever series (if you don't mind the ""Nature Boy Karajan"" picture on the cover of that set). Same recording of the organ symphony, other great stuff, less money."
1,awful,I bought two different kinds of these crackers without trying them first. They tasted like cardboard at best. They did have a good crunch but tasted so bad that I tossed both boxes. I can not eat wheat and have found that nutthins (a cracker made from nuts) are a fabulous substitute.
2,Herbs overpower this crunchy snack.,"I am usually the one in the group to try healthy new foods. I tried these crackers and agree with other reviewers: the taste of Rosemary is VERY overpowering. I'm not sure if there is also Fennel in these, but the aftertaste leads me to think so. Great crunch to them, though. Not to my taste, but perhaps to others' taste. These are not cheap, so if you can find a way to sample before you buy, DO IT!"
1,Pure Junk!!!,"I bought these to replace an older set of RCA wireless headphones in hopes to receive as good if not better sound quality on my PC for netflix and I Tunes. I was disappointed to say the least. These are poor quality and sound. The first problem I had was as soon as I tried to use the adapter to the computer it FELL apart. I tried to glue it together but it never was the same. I had another adapter so I just used it. Still little bass, mostly mono treble. Then they say you can purchase a d/c adapter at any electronics store to help charge the transmitter sad to say after looking around I couldn,t find a 12v 200ma adapter anywhere. So I figured I'd just use a rechargeable 9 V battery no problem. The problem is poor quality. The stinkin' battery door keeps falling off. Bottom line I'll give it to my son for his gaming and make my old RCA last til Christmas when I'll spend a few more bucks on a better quality and sound device."
3,Her best concert.,"I'll have agree with other remarks that the quality isn't up to speed, but this show is Diana's best.I had this on VHS from the HBO broadcast in 1980, so having it on DVD is a step up.I saw a version of this show in 1978 in Los Angeles and Diana was at her best.Hopefully ""Someday We'll Be Together"" and Diana will reunite with the fanastic Mary Wilson and the lovely Cindy Birdsong for a Supremes reunion.THAT would be an event to remember."
3,Disappointed,I went to see this movie. As I love these types of movies. BUT I was disappointed in the fact that it was sooo short. It lacked a lot of depth. Like the story line wasnt complete. It would have been a great movie if it had more super natural things going on and a complete ending.
1,pure nonsense,"Not sure what I was expecting. I've seen films like these before. It was free on prime so I figured, hey...why not? Nothing but superstition and gore. I couldn't finish watching it."
1,horrible,I heard this piece of garbage for horrible reviews but wanted to give it a chance. Starts of sorta spooky but really gets stupid quickly. Probably one of the worst endings to a movie I have ever seen.
1,Awful!,"I saw this in theaters and it made me sick. LITERALLY SICK!!!I remember when Blair Witch came out there were signs up in the lobby warning people that they may get motion sickness when watching this movie they may get sick from the constant camera movements but there were no such warnings for this.Plus what's worse with all the camera movements I couldn't see what was friggin' happening! What's the poing of watching a movie if you can't see what the hell is going on!?! Plus there was no real conclusion for the story, they just all die in a car crash with no explanation of what happened or what the demon wanted or what it's motives were.Don't waste your time or your money."
1,Nothing like the trailer.......,This rip off shows you what an edited trailer can do it sucks you in thinking this might be a decent horror movie but as it turns out its nothing like the trailer leads you to believe its just a phony documentary type with the usual bad acting and so forth.....Please stop already with this crap its old. I will always tell it like I see it good or badSCOTT M
2,Could've Been Way Better,All I have to say is that the ending to this movie was a total cop-out. The director/writer obviously had no idea where to go with the story and ended up wrecking what could have been a half decent horror flick.
3,Not Bad,"I didn't think this movie was that bad, unlike many who have stated that it was. It definitely wasn't scary, but it seemed to go along at a steady pace. The ending leaves you wondering..."
1,Poor,"Movie lost me around the point that they introduced the first ""official exorcism"" - not sure but it was ... lame?"
5,"Nice glass lid, nice price","Not much to really review here--but this is a very nice canopy and much cheaper then I could get at the local pet stores (and they never seem to have this size in stock, either It came with a little handle you can stick on which seems really sturdy. Otherwise-- it's glass with a plastic hinge! Not much to go wrong!"
3,Disappointing,"Even Herzog's worst is still worth watching once. His biggest mistake is casting a real strongman who simply cannot act. Also, Tim Roth overacts in every single scene, which I can only blame on poor direction. The Nazis are cardboard cutouts in comparison to movies by Fassbinder, Bergman, or even Tarantino. It also isn't at all revealing of jewish culture, although it pretends to be. Much more should have been made of the prophetic speeches of a simple country boy thrown into evil."
3,This is not the same Herzog...,"If you are an admirer of Herzog's great films (Aguirre, Heart of Glass, Nosferatu, Fitzcaraldo) I would like to caution you against this one - that is kind of a Hollywood picture (though it is pretty good for Hollywood standards). It lacks the experimentation of other Herzog films - and is shot in a very unlike Herzog way - this is the first Herzog film that really feels like a film - like it is on a set instead of in the wilderness or in a seemless period cottage. I do not think this is a bad movie - but a bad example of Herzog..."
2,disappointing,"While the subject matter continues to fascinate, this film is too cliche ridden and questionably acted."
1,DON'T BOTHER WATCHING THIS ONE!,"This is possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The writing and acting, as far as I am concerned, are no better than that of a middle school live performance. The only reason I didn't turn it off was that I was hoping SOMETHING in the movie might help me justify spending $10 to buy it used. That something never came. I would never waste my time on this movie when there are others on this topic that so richly deserve my viewing time investment, such as ""Schindler's List"" & ""The Pianist"". Trust me, PASS IT UP just as fast as you can!"
1,Unbelievably Bad,"The acting and writing is atrocious and I was dumbfounded that some people would rate this movie highly.The little brother's spoken parts are so British it is laughable and the hero, his brother, has a Scandanavian accent. The main character is no actor and it is embarrassing at times listening to him and watching him. The whole movie is so contrived and corny I gave up watching it more than halfway through. Just because it is based on a real character doesn't make it a good, or watchable movie."
1,An embarrassment to the region!,"These boys hail from my immediate area of the state of Georgia and I, for one, finds their lyrics to be offensive and genuinely distasteful to anyone with any smidgen of morality.I only needed to hear the single ""Cut Loose"" to know that this is not worth the expenditure. Do these guys actually consider the impressionability of their young audience?I think not, and for that Field Mob needs to be criticized, not praised.What segment of black America does the earlier reviewer think that Field Mob represents? Definitely, no one in my circle favors such crudeness.Honestly, I'd like to reduce my stars by one. But, Amazon won't allow that."
2,"Fading light, fading glory?","These co-authors have written for an audience that will already be convinced of the worthwhileness of their thesis, i.e., that America is the new ""chosen land."" For a non-American, looking backwards in history from the present day,the argument is not quite so convincing. Certainly, the faith and courage exhibited by the earliest pioneeers makes for inspirational reading and, to be fair, the authors work quite hard to sustain the impetus of their presentation. The narrative lags seriously in a few places and the writers' uncertainties are made apparent to the reader, which hardly adds to the power of the argument. As a work of historical criticism it rates about one star but because the anecdotes are interesting I rated it at two stars."
5,The real principles upon which this country was founded.,"Marshall and Manuel have written a book that could not bemore timely. For those who eschew revisionist history,this book sheds light on the values, belief systems andmindset of the founding fathers. Must reading for thosewho would understand the reason our country is not workingand how to remedy the problem by returning to our roots."
2,Basic English Review,"Not happy at all!All the assignments throughout the textbook was done, so it was more like an answer key book instead of a workbook!I need a refund!"
1,Fall apart before good use,I got these for my fiance and he had them about 3 days. He was playing a gig using these to keep the volume low and one stick burst open with the wires flying everywhere. He only had it for a couple of days before it broke.
4,Great---spell binding,"This is a great story. Each of the Young Jedi Knights books is better than the last. I like the way the authors keep adding new charactors. Everyone of the books could stand alone, not just be the next in a searies. I highly recomend this book!!!!"
3,The series draws to a close,"One of the penultimate entries in the YJK series, you will likely find yourself zipping through this book and not waiting to pick up the next volume.Recommended to fans of the series."
4,Helpful SI reference,I found this book to be a good primer to learn about SI and what I could do to help my friend.
2,"great skates, bad sizing","The sizing on these skates is entirely off!! Such a disappointment to receive them just in time for my daughters birthday to find that the size 5 is actually a youth size 4 (sizing on tongue says Adult 5, Youth 4, European 35). Knowing that Heelys run small I intentionally ordered a size up too. Had to order a completely different style from another site. I still don't understand how an adult 5 is a youth 4 . . ."
5,I rate this product a high ten.,"Fantastic tweezers, best I have ever used. I just purchased two for my teenage granddaughters as gifts, they love them. My Tweezerman Tweezers are blunt tip which I have had over six years."
5,Loved It,"This is an intriguing follow-up to My Soul to Keep. The original characters, Jessica, Dawit, and Alex are back along with some new faces that make the novel both thrilling and mysterious to read. The novel opens with the birth of Jessica and Dawit's daughter Fana. We had a hint of what Fana was like in My Soul to Keep, but we find there's much more to who and what Fana is and will become. What's more, it is Jessica's responsibility to care for Fana while trying to put the past and her past love for Dawit behind her even after the three of them are finally reunited. Due does an excellent job in taking the reader through a series of twist and turns without being confusing or neglectful of character development. I enjoyed this exploration of the unknown and what ifs, and recommend this to all readers.P.S.: For the faint of heart, the novel is not scary."
2,Corn Syrup,"I was disappointed to see that they add corn syrup to the blueberries. If you're going to use ""Natural"" in your name, you shouldn't add corn syrup!"
4,Compassionate and Practical,"As our parents age, it's easy to become overwhelmed with the changes in behavior, memory, and attitude. This book is a quick look at some easy changes the ""children"" can make in our lives to help communicate with Mom or Dad. It's not extensive, but it is helpful and caring. It helps. Enjoy."
4,all about timbo,"This album is all about the production. Yea, it's ""Ms. Jade's"" cd, but its nothing without the timbaland beats. If u look past the tight beats, its just mediocore spittin. Still, the beats make it a worthwhile cd, definately buy it. The top tracks are Dead Wrong, Feel the Girl, Big Head, and Ching Ching part II"
5,Great Book,Covered all the area's of the case. Top Notch. Would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the case. Five out of Five stars.
4,Very detailed,He did just what I wanted him to do in the case. Just the facts. This case has been too bogged down with a bunch of unnecessary side stories.
2,Could have been magazine article,"Although only 161 pages, it was still too long. Scott Berg did a much better job in his seminal biography of Lindbergh (which is less expensive). Mediocre to poor writing at best; frequently obtuse. This is a greatly expanded magazine type article. He sarcastically and self righteously criticizes an actress for protraying Mrs. Hauptmann even though she had doubts about Hauptmann's guilt. I guess no movies or plays can be made about guilty people. That illogical statement is illustrative of the author's approach. He should go back to the FBI where that type of thinking is highly valued and rewarded."
2,Wrong CD,They gave me the drama cd not the original soundtrack. Whats up with that? I'm not sure also if I should send it back.
3,Be careful,"Listening to the album did feel like it lifted a weight off of my shoulders as most smooth jazz (gag) does with its lite and breezy sounds, and Janita's voice is definitely more than pleasant but for anyone to compare her to India.Arie, Alicia Keys, Jill Scott and even Sade is a TRAGIC mistake. Janita is a good singer with a nice sound, but the next big thing . . . hah! This comparison reminds me of when people used to say that Harry Connick Jr. was the next big thing in vocal jazz, again nice sound but not even close."
4,Different and Tasty,"These were a pleasant suprise. I had never even tried some of the spices in this sample pack. The two ounce pack is just about the correct size for snacking. It also helps that if you like one, the sample pack has a twin. If one variety turns you off, oh well. Not too salty or sweet or peppery. Just right.I really like Ksar (with the pistachios) and the Valdosta (with the almonds)."
4,Nice Ring!!!,I like the ring very much. It is a little smaller than I expected. Aside from that I am very happy with it.
4,Disguised as Humor,"I loved this book when it came out in 1990 (right?). I see it has been somewhat updated. It contains very helpful, true information. I just wish it wasn't all disguised as humor. Many of my friends didn't like this book because they thought it was making fun of us."
1,This does not help at all.,This does not help at all. I did send it back because it is worthless. In times with Maps and google on your iphone this is just not worth anything.
2,Not a long lasting item,"We've used the cover for about 2 years before finally having to toss it away. It looked cool once we got it over the standard size grill, however one side easily ripped even though we took a lot of precaution. (its an extremely tight fit so measure your grill first)Within the first year and Winter outside, the white became a dingy yellow and cracks from our dry Summer formed all over (even though it stayed mostly in a shaded area).By the 2 year mark it looked pretty bad and had to go"
3,Whispering Sands - Erle S. Gardner,"The previous review which encourages readers to throw away Edward Abbey and read mystery novels to learn about the southwestern deserts is akin to telling readers to throw away L. van der Post and read Rider Haggard to learn about the Kalahari, or to watch the Sci Fi channel instead of Discovery to learn about space travel. While Mr. Gardner did love the deserts, his books (with the exception of some non-fiction he wrote which this gentleman probably has not read)are certainly not going to serve the same purpose, nor do they contain the same level of information on the natural processes in these areas as Mr. Abbeys do, neither would they typically appeal to the same readership (by a LONG shot).Comparing any of these mystery novels to Desert Solitaire or any other of Mr. Abbeys essays is nonsense."
1,What a Waste,"I bought this item as I like the old Black & White Felix the Cat cartoons, and I was hoping to add to my collection at an inexpensive price. But when I first played the DVD, I was disappointed. There is no on screen menu so that you can go from one cartoon to another. Your only options are start, stop, fast forward to navigate to cartoons. There is no list as to what is on the DVD. I wouldn't waste the money. It's not worth it."
2,Should have stayed in Vegas!,"This is not ""Casino,"" or ""Ocean's Eleven,"" or ""3,000 Miles to Graceland."" It is not even ""The Hangover."" I just love Las Vegas -- thus, the two stars!"
4,I will give it 4 stars,"I can't say it's a perfect album....but the songs inside this album are quite nice...especially the "" No Doubt"", "" So Good"" , "" Hush"" and "" Music as We Make""....these are the songs I like so much."
2,I would not recomend this to anyone,"I got the book to write on a project that I'm working on and for the most part, it gave me insight for a few aspects of a director's vision.although this book was written for a film related profession,I dont see outside readers even being interested in how he rates movies. It is my opinion it's 10 chapters of ranting and another ten of clear idol worship."
3,this is the time to fly (DVD review),"at first i was afraid to buy this dvd set because of some of the reviews, including the one talking about how they changed the theme song. but overall, i'm glad i bought seasons 1 and 2 of south of nowhere. while the origonal theme song by the donna's WAS better suited, and despite how much i hate to say this... i love the new theme. *waits for people to groan* the first time i heard it i was like ""ew"" but then as time went on i fell in love with it, singing along and making my mom give me weird looks :Pthere are no special feautures on either season 1 and 2, but i didn't think SoN was going to ever be released on dvd, so the fact that is IS and that all the episodes are here, well, that's good enough for me. they just better release season 3, too, or i'm gonna be pissed.P.S. - (season 2's theme is the same, ""wasted"" by L.P.)"
5,Great for the questioning of sexuality.,"This show was amazing as it tells the story of the Carlins. Paula the mom, Arthur the dad, Glenn the oldest brother, Clay the adopted black brother, and Spencer whom the show focuses most of it's attention on. I wish this had come out years earlier when I was questioning my own sexuality. It deals with the relationship of Spencer Carlin and Ashley Davies. Paula has a hard time accepting Ashley for being a lesbian and Spencer's best friend. The Carlins are a catholic family who moves from Ohio to Los Angeles CA. Although it's a teen show that shows sexuality differences there are other characters as well as their relationships. A definite recommend."
3,"Love the show, not the picture quality","I first saw this show online, and was completely hooked on it. I think it's a fantastic show and wish there had been shows like this when I was younger.However, the reason for my 3 star rating is not because of the show itself, but because of the quality of the video. It really looks like it was just downloaded from one of the sites that it streams from. The picture is fuzzy and the audio is kind of flat. People who have reviewed the DVD version have had similar complaints.I wanted to get this show so that I could show it to someone else, but I'm not sure I'd buy any other seasons of it, instead I'll just watch it online. Logo still has it online."
4,It's About Time!!,I was so happy to see the pop-up on The~N for seasons 1-2. I only got season 1 and am very happy with the CD-R quality. Can't get enough of the Maddison/Ashley feud and the love that starts to blossom between Ashley and Spencer is priceless :-)
5,The Law and Your Legal Rights/La Ley y Sus Derechos Legales,"The Law and Your Legal Rights should be part of every Hispanic family's personal library. The book provides an easy to understand guide to the rights and responsibilities of all U.S. residents. Its explanation of the U.S. court systems is clear and concise, as well as its narrative of immigration and labor laws. The book's ability to ""speak"" in two languages--English and Spanish-- is one of its best features since it will help imigrants to obtain a basic understanding of their obligations and rights. Jess Araujo, Esq., has provided the Spanish speaking American with a valuable tool. The book should be read by all American students in middle school and/or high school."
5,Fantastic!!,"I LOVE this pasta! I wish it were in more grocery stores so I wouldn't have to pay for shipping, but even with shipping, it is worth it. I am in Weight Watchers and am thrilled that I can fill up on this great tasting pasta. It has a wonderful taste and texture, and I don't feel like I am sacrificing ANYTHING by using it."
4,The Best Series is Inspector Lynley,"Because I am such an avid fan of Elizabeth George, I could not wait to order this Set (1). I also purchased Sets 2 and 3.What enjoyment! The acting is the best of the best.A perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon.Now I am waiting in great anticipation for Set 4!Hurry."
3,"Well, it was ok...","This Book was ok. it was not as good as the first one, but it was ok. This book shifts more to the Politics of the PLanet more than the Dragons. I mean, dont get me wrong, there are dragons in it, but just not as many as in the first one, which somewhat dissapointed me. I was hoping to get a good dragon book, like the first one, but what i found was that it was more a political book with dragons in the backround. I would read it if you read the first book, but dont expect it to be near as good as the first book."
3,Well-made but insole liner folds over,"This shoe is a slip-on and I expect to be able to just slip my foot in, walk around, and then slip my foot out when done. However, whenever I slip my foot out, the insole liner folds over itself. I then have to press it back into position with my hand. This occurs with both the right and left shoe. I think they just made it too soft to stay put without deforming. On the bright side, the shoe is comfortable and otherwise well-constructed."
1,Fool,"disjointed, hard to get into,could not get past about 30% of it. would not recommend it to any one gave up on it."
3,"Verbose, not witty","I found it difficult to connect with the voice of the author. It is hard to describe why it bothered me. Perhaps it was too baroque and seemed as if the author was trying too hard to be witty. It also smacked of writing from a previous, more verbose age. Since this was on Nancy Pearl's Book Lust list I was expecting much better. Probably won't try more books on her list."
2,An odd book,"Following Nancy Pearl's 50 page rule, I gave up - thought the book a little bizarre. It rambles too much."
1,not that interesting,the main character really just whines a lot. The story describes a man who is a self-professed boob. Not edifying writing unless you enjoy men-bashing
3,Good use,Does the job. Wrote on it with a permanent marker has started to fade a little but works just fine.
1,Please consider this before purchasing this...,"As it has been stated before, Ricky Carralero actually painted over the works of another artist and took credit for it. Please consider this before purchasing this art book."
4,Present moment awareness is necessary today more than ever,I find his book a great guidebook for learning to live in the present moment. It's a necessary tool today if we want to stay grounded through the madness in our world.
5,What a great book!,"This book is one of the best on enlightenment I have ever read! It not only explains the state of enlightenment and the process involved, but also explains how we can approach this state. This book is easy to understand and a pleasure to read. As Toru Sato convincingly shows us in his book, ""The Ever-Transcending Spirit"" it is impossible to reach a state of enlightenment while we are ""trying"" to become enlightened. However this book still eloquently shows us that living in the moment is the essence of enlightenment and what that really means. If you are ready for this next step, the ideas in this book will resonate in your heart. If you are interested in enlightenment, definitely read these books!"
5,Amazing...,I definetely recommend this book to everybody. You'll read this book many times and you'll be more enlightened each time.
5,A Must Read!,"This book has the power to change lives. Suitable for any worldview, this powerful manual for improved living can make a huge difference in your life. It has certainly changed my life. Next to the Bible, this is the most important book I own; The Power of Now and the Bible go together seamlessly in my experience. Makes a fantastic gift!"
5,The reader has to be ready...,"There are many great reviews of this wonderful book and I don't believe I can add anything to provide any more meaningful content. My only comment is that this book came to me at the right time and this is important. If the reader is not ready, this book may very well be meaningless."
1,Don't throw your money away,"Beyond the first few lines it's a load of waffled gobbledygook. If you want something excellent about meditation buy: Angel Tech by Antero Alli, Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson, and Undoing Yourself... by Christopher S. Hyatt."
2,Tolle shoulda' picked another reader besides himself,"I enjoyed the book, for a time anyways, The Power of Now (it has since degenerated into The Power of Then). But as soon as I heard Tolle's voice, the knowledge and enjoyment I previously had gleaned just kinda' deflated and balloon-farted out the window. His heavily accented German is hard to understand and makes it an effort in heavy concentration to listen to and just peacefully enjoy. My wife was similarly let down upon hearing his somewhat high-pitched and most assuredly not-ready-for-prime-time reciting voice."
3,45 minute tracks?,"The information is very powerful, unfortunately the presentation is cumbersome. Each CD is only 2 tracks and each track is 20-45 minutes each. And yet the book is a series of questions and answers. They should have made each question a track. It doesn't cost anything extra and it would make the entire CD experience worthy of the material he presents.Also, the book is read by the author. And I must say his thick German accent and extremely monotone voice make it very challenging to listen to this audio program, particularly in the car. I know it is wonderful when the author reads his work, but that's only when he has a good speaking voice. Echart Tolle does not. Tolle should have read the introduction, and then a professional reader should have taken over."
1,Happy clappy nonsense,"A colleague begged me to buy this book and give it a go :-/I did, and I regretted it.Basically, if you are unhappy, look deep within yourself and find what it is that makes you happy. It is easy and it is in there somewhere, apparently!There you go, I have just saved you 8 dollars. Something else to be happy about :)Ciao for now"
2,overhyped,"I was very excited about getting this book and reading it. I am half way through it and I see nothing that enlightenening about it? He takes excerpts from the bible and intertwines them with his thoughts/opinions. Also, he is very repetitive and contractictsa lot. Do not recommend...much better books out there by far."
5,Enlightenment on Life,"I love this book! It helps you remember what has been lost, entangled with ALL life's tug of war to stop your chattering mind and reclaim the stillness, peace. Live in the NOW and letting go."
3,Whats New?,"I read this book only this year, though it was a bestseller. But what is new in this book? These were the teachings of the Art of Living foundation since 1982. With that price tag, it looks like another business. But in any case, this book is worth reading."
3,A Little Short on Technique,"This book is okay as far as it goes. We all pretty much agree that we need to get clearer. But for actual techniques to acquire a state of mindfulness, awareness, or present reality I suggest The Power of Full Engagement or if you are battling real negativity and anxiety, Depression is a Choice."
5,Please read this book,"This book was extremely helpful in my opening. I can think of no other source, save a live master, that could be more helpful to someone looking to explore their spiritual side.This book is also excellent for analytical thinkers, and for people who are turned off by religion."
5,Now is the time,"All you need to do is stop and be very still. I am a university student, studying psychology. I am always questoning my experience. After exams, or when I have just handed in an assignment I have always noticed a strange peace which comes upon me. Its as if the struggle is over, and we can start living now. My perception of the outside world is also slightly diferent. Things for some reason seem to glow a bit more, as if they are coming to life. The shapes do not change, but the experience of them does.Athletes feel the same way. It seems that we all have milder versions of what Tolle experienced;his was more complete. The book is beutiful, a real gem."
5,Fantastic,"I had the opportunity to meet Ekhart Tolle I just have to say he is a great human being,so is his book, one of the best."
4,Critique,"The one issue I have with Tolle's teachings is that it seems that he treats what he calls the ""pain body"" as something bad that needs to be eradicatedFrom my experience, what he calls the pain body, stems from previous moments in our lives where we suppressed, for various reasons...And when we treat the pain body as something negative that needs to be eliminated, it's hard not to view it as a threat of some sort, you are still resisting it in the NOWI find it is much better to treat the pain body like a child who just wants to know everything is going to be ok...treat it with love, compassion, and with kid gloves. Be the parent to yourself that was needed in those previous moments...Best"
5,"Great Book, Live in the Present","After reading many many books by several empowering authors such as Deepak Chopra, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dalai Lama, and Tiffany Snow, that I am still reading, my life has opened up to me in such a compelling and wonderful way. This new book is well written, and thought provoking. There are great transforming authors, who shift the consciousness of humankind in a way never known before. The ""Power of Now"" is one of those."
2,Rehashing enlightenment with some odd twists...,"""When you become identified more with the timeless inner body than with the outer body...you do not accumulate time...in the cells of your body. The accumulation of time...greatly impairs the cell's capacity for renewal. Is there any scientific evidence for this? Try it out and you will be the evidence."" E. Tolle, The Power of NowIf this passage appeals to you then you'll enjoy the book. If you are familiar with the works of Wayne Dyer or Depak Chopra then you won't find much new material here but you might prefer Tolle's delivery. The writing is adequate with a rather contrived, I think, sense of mystery. Like all of the New Age writers Tolle pulls indiscriminately from dozen of teachers to weave his particular version of enlightenment. Some of his ideas are just plain goofy but most are harmless. If you can pick through the weeds you might find something of use here."
1,The Power of Hype,"I tried to read a few of Tolle's books, and despite the hype, found them to be bland, vague, humorless and uninspiring. He doesn't come across as a real person, but rather, a gross caricature of a ""spiritual master"", overly serious and dry, and at times, a prude.I try to refrain from being a cynic, though I would tend to agree with some of the other posters here, who also find Tolle to be a cleverly adept bullsh-- artist. Upon closer inspection, his esoteric writing has no real substance.Instead, I recommend Richard Bach, Seth / Jane Roberts, Shakti Gawain, Wayne Dyer, Stuart Hill, or Louise Hay.Peace out, everyone. Happy Holidays!"
5,Wow!,I had been looking for a book about spirituality and enlightenment and didn't want a religious book. This book blew my mind and easily explained it and how I could achieve it. I recommend to all who are trying to complete them selves.
4,Read this book,"I found the book fascinating and practical, and have been using its advice in my daily activities - especially stressful situations at work - with great success."
4,Great but difficult,"In-so-far as content, I think this is a great book, because of the importance of what it discusses. For people who have not ever considered spirituality, mind, body, spirit...I think this would be difficult to get through.This would not be the first book that I would recommend to anyone who maybe seeking ""self"" knowledge. As the ""next"" book to read...perhaps..."
2,Power of Now Review - good for some not for others,I am reading the Power of Now in a book discussion class that I am attending at my church. The majority of the members are not impressed with this book. This is not a good book for people who have been truth seeker for years and feel that they are making progress. It is a good book for people who are stuck spinning their wheels in negative memories of the past or are too fearful to move forward in the future. Eckhart Tolle gives the impression that he has found enlightenment and anyone that disagrees with him has not. You can feel his ego throughout the book.
4,Life changer? Maybe.,"Tolle presents a good perspective that isn't necessarily intuitive to anyone raised in Western society. His presentation makes it accessable and relatively easy to understand and assimilate. Though I suspect that few people will adopt his practices 100%, I believe that everyone would benefit from the concepts and incorporate those habits and practices that are valid for them in particular. In short, almost everyone will find some benefit from this read."
1,junk theology,"Junk theology, junk science, junk history, junk psychology, junk philosophy -- shamelessly derivative of St Paul, Augustine, Plato, various snippets of Buddhism and Hindu teaching, sciencey factoids"
1,pompass,"egotistical attitude - read first few chapters, can't take anymore of it....get The Master Key by Charles F. Haanel instead."
5,The Power of Now,"I recommend this book to everyone. The Power of Now is a fascinating textbook for becoming a happy human being. It is direct and easy to understand. You see yourself on every page. And, of course, it is even easier to see everyone else you know on these same pages! Listen, learn and try it - you'll be glad you did."
1,This Book Pisses Me Off,"tolle uses the power of now to brag about how he invented/discovered present-time awareness and has reached enlightenment faster than the buddha himself. after 1/3 of his book, i am unconvinced that tolle will be able to free me from pain and suffering. i will take refuge in the three jewels, four noble truths, and eight fold path, while continuing my mediation practice... thank you very much... instead of listening to this park bench prophet for profit."
5,Where you are right now reading this is,"what The Power of Now is all about. Learning from Oprah and reading this book added so much insight into how I perceive what's happening all around me. We so often worry about the future...worry about what's next but in reality, you are experiencing a moment in your life, in time. Focus on this moment and not what has yet to transpire."
5,changed my life,"Started my long journey of meditation, If you dont know where to start and you are not sure what religion you believe, this book takes all the philosophies and targets what we are all trying to acheive, makes it aquireable."
1,Boring self-indulgent navel-gazing,"Hard to read with drifting off to sleep in sheer boredom. My therapist (who recommended I read this) even said the whole book should have been a 15 page pamphlet. He was right. I got about 4 times further than that and realized my nightstand was filled with books to be read far more important, interesting and relevant than this. Tolle covers his own ass by saying at the outset that people with reactions like mine were closeminded and unenlightened. Whatever."
1,The Power of Now,"This book one of the weirdest book I have ever read,The author using complex and hard to understand word style.Really I have read many books recently and I regret getting this one.The vendor was Ok, he delivers on time with decent price."
1,Self-contradictory,"It is self-contradictory that authors like Tolle claim problems are mind-made. If problems do not exist at all in their mind, then why do they perceive that others have problems? Why do they provide solutions? Ask you to follow their prescription? Why do these people write a book or ask you to attend their workshops? For otherwise if you do not follow, it will only make you further depressed.Their problem is that their NOW `thinks' (do not know how they can think when their mind is still) others have problems and they are the only enlightened beings. If they expound an idea that in reality there are no problems, they should refrain providing solutions or stop writing books about the subject. It is amazing how a well educated society falls for the rhetoric and follows the path to an illusionary Garden of Eden."
2,He spent two years smiling and hanging out in park benches..,"While i generally sorta like the whole NOW ideology about not wasting each second and embracing the present moment, it makes me wonder why should i take this whole book as is. What prevents me from doing that is the fact that he spent two years hanging around the park sitting on the bench and stuff like that...it creeps me out!"
2,Not Impressed,I was wondering what all the hype was about this person. The book doesn't hold my attention.
2,"Not logical, Captain.","I've read it more than once, to get his message and I agree that one can cleverly resolve vexing issues by simply being/stepping into the present. However, that is just a defensive tool to avoid depression and to turn on ""happy apathy"" when the going gets tough. Neat trick, but the ""fluffy bunny"" experience does not, in my opinion, guide one to spiritual enlightenment. It just guides one on how to selfishly step out of the icky game of life and irresponsibly leave the remaining writhing mass of humanity to their own discomforts. Slaves of sleep. Not logical Captain. Spiritual enlightenment would seem to be the creative taking of full responsibility for repairing the games of life so one never gets trapped again. Less tragic lessons. More wisdom in resolving life's little anxieties rather than ignoring them. Read Judge Thomas Troward for empowering creative enlightment."
5,A Life Changer,"Tolle presents what has been presented by many others from a challenging and new point of view. I especially liked the question-answer format. It cuts right to the point and has no fluff. His style is straight forward, no mush. The book is basically in three parts: how he got here, his philosophy, how to apply his ideas.Some people want to cut right to part three, but I think the whole is better than the parts when you are first being introduced to his philosophy. I would urge people to read this book first and then go to the next ""Practicing"" later for something to carry around for easy referral.Like others have said, his work has changed my life - especially how I handle my relationships, letting go of things and living in forgiveness NOW.Overall, very powerful, but his words will only work for you if you are ready to hear them."
2,The Power of Now,"The book came very damaged, the corner of the book was flipped back and the pages were black. I emailed the bookstore that sent it and they are sending me another copy. I wanted to give this to a friend and there was no way I was giving it to he. But I got a response from the seller and I am happy about that."
3,"Great, but...","This book was a revelation for me, and helped me tremendously. That said, it was unfortunately boring, repetitive and ""full of unnecessary words"". I believe Tolle could've achieved the same result with 50 pages instead of the 224 in the book.It should've been either fully psychological or fully ""spiritual"". I don't doubt Tolle ""seeing the light"" but it was less believable once I felt that he was listening to himself talk.Again, the first part of the book was very powerful, and helped me be in the 'NOW', after that, for the second part, I had to skip passages, and run toward the last page. To read with a manual on how to use it fast. ;-)"
4,Very Powerful NOW,"I learn what I use to be and how I have been hurting myself with lie and anger. Let me be something different who is a enlighting person with a purpose. That is right I change Now thanks to ""The Power OF Now"" it will change you too so go read it NOW!!!"
2,12 stepper,"I found this book to be repetitive and a little flaky. There were a few ""takeaways"" for me but generally speaking, not that great. The quest for heightened awareness and spirituality is a good one, but this book did little to get me there."
3,"Excellent read, but.......","I purchased this book after seeing it reviewed in O magazine. Now, I was a philosophy major in college so it's not like I'm dense or anything, but parts of this book completely left me scratching my head. The basic premise is MARVELOUS and if you do nothing but take the THEME with you and make it a part of your life, well then the book is worth it's price. But so much of this book bogs down in it's own mud that you have to be extraordinarily patient to plod through and pull out the gems. Still... all that said... I am SO glad I read this book and it's one of those experiences that never leaves you... I find myself reflecting on it and reminding myself to LIVE by it all the time."
5,Butter Boy,My grandchildren will love him! They are all at the age where they love using things like the butter boy and it helps teach them how to do it.
5,Funny!,This movie is hilarious! Its a great movie when you are feeling blue. A real feel good movie. It's the first movie I saw completely centered around drinking.
1,Tuesdays with Morrie DVD,"Unfortunately I have not been able to view this DVD as it is in a format only available in America and not available in AUSTRALIA so have wasted my money, time and effort. I was looking forward to seing this as I have bought and read the book and I was moved by it greatly."
5,A+++ Shipping & Seller :) :) ;),"I heard about this movie from my older sister whom is a Dr., and recommended for me to watch;heart felt movie a must see :) glad I bought and watched it ;)"
5,My Girlfriend loved it,"Well,It was really amazing to see how my GF love the flawles sterling silver floating heart. The thing is that design and shape of heart makes it very unique I'd say. On the downside I can say that the chain was not that well designed but it good pretty good with heart itself. All in all I would recommend it."
3,"great heart pendant, poor chain","The heart pendant is good looking, very shiny and a good weight and from the reviews I've read the shine on the heart will stay. I was disappointed in the chain as the lobster clasp did not close all the way and it seemed a bit flimsy (also mentioned in some reviews). I've ordered a separate chain and if it works, then I'll use it for the heart to give as a special gift. If not, then I'll send all back. Not happy about ordering another chain, but the heart was just what I was looking for."
1,The dialect....,"This book's dialect is too hard to read! Example: ""Awreet. Dem durgs's deed bah noo."" And that is only one sentance! The diolect was so bad, I had to quit reading this book. Donot get this book. I strongly suggest Watership Down, a much better book."
1,First book I ever threw away!,"The Plague Dogs: A NovelI could not stand the pain of reading this book. I know, things like this happen to our animals. After reading the ending of the book, I was so angry that I went to the wastebasket and threw the book away. I wish, the ending had been more clear."
4,An adult read,"My first instinct was to claim that whilst this book is wonderful, it does not quite meet the precedent set by ""Watership Down"". However, this is not really the case. ""The Plague Dogs"" is simply a far more adult, mature read than ""Watership"" and whilst it can by no means be described as easy reading, it is certainly worth that extra bit of concentration. The writing style is amazing as always, and the storyline gripping and fascinating. Adams' ability to switch from the perspective of the two dogs, Rowf and Snitter, to the humans is incredible. The book's witty contributions, gripping story line and happy ending make a wondeful story without diminishing any of the underlying concerns. It is an incredible masterpiece, and should be devoured eagely by dog-lovers and book-lovers alike!"
5,The Plague Dogs is a wonderfull book--could be the best!,"The Plague Dogs is a beautiful novel about two dogs, Snitter and Rowf, who escape an animal research center (A.R.S.E) after being cruely tested on, in the name of science. After running away, they befriend the nasty trickster, the tod. A rumor also starts that Snitter and Rowf are carriers of a plague. People are forced to shoot and kill them. I'm very pleased with the ending. Five golden stars for Richard Adam's Plague Dogs! Also check out the rare animated film ""The Plague Dogs"" based on The Plague Dogs. But you'll need to read the book, first."
5,Whimsical,"I picked this up used at a library sale. Great read. Wilks gets into the psychology of the characters without being awkward or interrupting the story. I love the secret crush element Cassie and Gideon had for each other, but neither realized until well into their marriage.I hope to find Wilks' other works as enjoyable (I read her short in Lover Beware: Only Human-a great paranormal story). The only bad thing I can say: there needs to be more!"
3,did not love her,the story was nice. the hero did not love the heroine. he lusted after her. it makes you believe good things hppen to bad people. the hero did not deserve the heroine's love. he was mean to her all the time.
3,"Thermalon Microwave Activated Moist Heat-Cold Therapy Wrap with Ties 7"" x 12"" by Thermalon","Thermalon Microwave Activated Moist Heat-Cold Therapy Wrap with Ties for Back, Hip, Shoulder, 7"" x 12""by Thermalon works alright. I purchased this to replace an Earth Therapeutics wrap that is similar in size/function (for your back) but has velcro closure rather than tie. The velcro became very worn out on it, but as much as I used the other brand (I've had chronic sciatica for nine+ years, three back surgeries and an spinal cord impant so I know back pain!) I will purchase the other in the future when this Thermalon wears out. The thing that attracted me to trying this product was that it states it is machine washable (the other brand was not) however I have yet to try washing the Thermalon. I don't feel like it retains heat as well as the previous brand I owned either (had it for about 4 years)."
4,If grandma is happy with it so am I,I bought this as a gift for my grandma and she really loves it since she can simply tie it around her knee or put it against her lower back. it maintains heat for a long time.
3,Pretty Good,"I use this on my piriformis muscle (butt) or else upper thigh. The tying system leaves a bit to be desired. Velcro would hold better I believe. It tends to slip. Wearing it under a pair of shorts or sweatpants helps keep in place. I like that it can be hot or cold. Doesn't seem to stay hot or cold for long but 15 minutes is probably enough. For my particular injuries (piriformis, hamstring pull) its not making a night and day cure. Hopefully it will for you."
2,Don't waste your time and money on this,"The first time I used this product, it worked great! This is the only reason I am not giving it a 1 star review. The second time I tried to use it, I popped in the microwave for 2 minutes. I thought this was not too long, according to the package directions. When I went to pull it out, thousands of little beads came pouring out of a hole in the corner. What a mess! This product is hardly well made if it cannot withstand a single use. Don't waste your time and money on this product. It is not well made at all."
4,Great for back pain.,"I wear it by itself, or over a Thermacare to give the Thermacare a ""jump start"". Even after the Themalon cools, it seems to serve as ""insulation"" so that more of the heat from the Thermacare is directed toward the back."
1,Almost worthless!,"This product looked good and liked the idea of the ties to keep it in place, but after full time in microwave it barely got hot enough to do a thing and only stayed warm for about 5 minutes. Was replacing another brand I bought several years ago and finally microwaved it a bit too much and it sort of melted, but was a far superior product and stayed warm/hot for up to an hour. Am returning this and will look for my older brand again."
2,Pokemon again,Come on people how many pokemon games have we been through aleready. Besides It's almost the same as pokemon gold and silver. My advice to you is to rent it before you buy it. The graphics are good but the sound isn't so good. If you have pokemon gold and silver it's almost the same as that so just don't buy it it stinks.
1,????????,Well the reason for 1 star is because I haven't played it before.But I heard that It's a must buy!
1,unsavable Pokemon Crystal Version,"The original game cartridge purchased would not save the progress. It was returned and replaced by seller(Lukie Games, Inc.). Replacement game cartridge also would not save game progress. This game cartridge has faulty or dead save battery."
1,Edgar Review,The book dwells on too many examples on what causes low self esteem instead of recommending what course of action is needed to acquire high self esteem. Not recommended for those people wanting to improve their self esteem.
2,Demonizing the Angels,"In The Western Canon, Harold Bloom, probably the most influential - and some say greatest - critic, listed Angels in America (the play)as one of the important works. As a play, I see how it may work - great metaphorical, beautiful language and sometimes in iambic pentameter - very Shakespeare.But adapted to screen, I think it is the language that fails. It sounds contrived and unnatural. When Shakespeare's plays are transposed to films, the directors often find new ways, new settings, new mise-en-scene to match the metaphoric language but in the case of Angels in America (the series), the director does not and that's where it fails.Another thing that I do not understand is why Al Pacino is given the best actor in the Golden Globe over Douglas Kirk who plays a more central and convincing role. Marry-Louise Parker is undeserving of her best supporting actress Golden Globe award as she is most of the time, wooden at best."
5,Surprisingly good,"I first saw this play about three years ago, and fell in love with it. I went back three times to see it before it closed at the end of the week. So, as you can imagine, I was both intrigued and afraid of what HBO might to do this wonderful play.As I began watching, I was impressed with the cinematography, although a few of the characters seemed a bit stiff, and hard to relate to as actual human beings. Perhaps this was do to the toned-down style of acting in film as opposed to theatre. By the end, however, I was almost in tears. This is the best film I've seen in a very long time."
2,Less than spectacular,"When do you actually sit and listen to 2 hours of the same artist, especially when those two hours include every piece of crap that artist ever pinched out? The middle ten of the 43 songs on here are excellent, edgy, and not completely slaving to any certain genre. But the old stuff is just proto-60s psychadelic rock (as if it could get more primitive). I congratulate him for inventing it, but it just doesn't hold up. There is also a bunch of knock-off Dylan on here. No good. If you want to hear the best stuff, I recommend ""I Think of Demons,"" or if you have the dough, ""The Evil One,"" which have the good songs."
4,If you like Roky you'll love this,"This is a great collection of the Roky Erickson's music. It covers all his eras - from the 13th Floor Elevators to the present day and includes all the classics. A fine, thoughtful and lovingly packaged collection."
2,"Too Long, Too Much Description of Surroundings","I understand this is a first time novel, and it was a good try, but this story could have been told in 250 pages, not 400. It would have been better if she spent more time in telling the story of the people, and less time describing every detail of the surroundings. The book drug on too long, too much of a good thing. I would have liked to see the character of Thula developed, and known more about what Matt thought, not just about what she did. I would not recommend this book, unless you have nothing else to read."
2,Body at Home,"I'm very unhappy with this book. While I appreciate the workout plans, none of these exercises tells you the areas they target - so I've got to put blind faith into doing this versus trying to target the areas I would like to tone. Had I know this, I would not have made the purchase. It seems ludicrous to have any exercise book/weight lifting plan without identifying the muscles worked."
2,This is an AWESOME dock if you have a compatible ipod!,"This is NOT compatible with any of the ipod touch units. I was so excited, and it's an awesome dock with lots of extras including wall charger (worth the price for that alone!), firewire cable, usb cable, 3.5 male to male cable, output for s-video, and the wall charger can be converted for U.S., U.K., or E.U. with all 3 plugs included (kind of amazing, right?)I was soooo sad to open the box and try it, only to find it is not compatible with my model. (Touch 4G.) The title says ""universal"" so I thought since mine fits the same charging dock as all the newer ipods, it would work. It WILL fit in the dock, but it won't recognize any of the outputs, and you get a ""charging not compatible with this device"" warning. I hope MAXELL has one of these for the iPod touches."
2,Possibly incompatible with firewire,"I have had a major problem with this dock. Which is that I can't get it to work with any firewire cable except the one supplied with it. I've tried several cables (that I've tested and I know for certain work) but none will work. I can get power (the blue light goes on) but I can't get the iPod (60 gig 4th gen photo) to show up in the itunes window or in the mac finder (I haven't tried it with windows). This problem is perplexing because I don't see any difference physically in the 6 pin firewire cable supplied with this dock and the others that I have tried. I've emailed maxell but they have yet to give me an answer to this problem (after one week). There may be a simple answer but I don't have time to make this dock work right. I need to use my ipod so I'm returning it. In short, a word of warning, If you need to connect this dock via firewire and need a cable longer than the two foot one supplied with it, you may be out of luck."
1,bogus,"This item is more or less bullshit. I own a earlier model of an ipod and yet somehow it wouldnt charge it. At all. Despite multiple attempts and reading the piss-poor instructions, the damn thing wouldnt work at all"
4,Not for iTouch,"Nice piece of equipment for price, however the term ""Universal"" is misleading.The unit will not work with a 4th generation iTouch."
3,"Great Sound, Horrible Comfort","These headphones are by Sony, so they have great sound quality, naturally. The bass is nice and low and the trebble is descently high, as all headphones should be.However, they are really uncomfortable. This is especially bad when you wish to recline and relax while listening to your music, like on an airplane or just around the house even.So, in the end, it's your choice. You could opt for earbuds or clip-ons and sacrifice sound quality (only slightly, that is, with Sony) or choose these for the sound quality and give up the comfort and actual ability to lean your head back. Good luck.(FYI I'm most likely going to buy some of the Sony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black) off of this site-they're pretty cheap and I only wish to lean my head back a little! I guess I'll just use my Sony MDR-G42LP Street Style Headphones for backup...)"
3,Ok type,"Pretty good, i married it to my Zen nano plus, works decent, pains ear after a while, sound quality is similar to the creative earphones shipped from creative.P.S: Im no audio phile, just a novice listener."
1,Broke in the first week.,I bought these refurbished and they broke in the first week. One side stopped playing completely. I was extremely disappointed.
2,You can do better,"These headphones can be slightly uncomfortable around the ears. Sometimes the part that loops behind the head is too bulky to sit comfortably while leaning on headrests or to fit under hoodies.I've had these headphones for about 4 months and the sound quality is waning. i can only hear from one earpiece most of the time.So basically, go for a higher quality, more comfortable item!"
1,Uhmmmm....,"Actually, Tutankhamen's name means ""Living Image of the God Amen""; Tutankhneb would be ""Living Image of Lord"", which we know wasn't his name. If the author can't get even the most rudimentary of hieroglyphs correct, one wonders what right he has to try and write a book covering this much history?Just one example of how ""facts"" are twisted neatly to fit his own agendas. And this book IS written with an agenda -- to convince you of something that's impossible, and to take your money. Give the Boy King a rest. If Moustafa really respected ancient Egypt, he would allow Tutankhamen's soul to have a little piece and not slander it with works like this."
4,All Over Sasha Alexander!,"Okay, where did this fine thespian come from? I loved the movie. The balance of humor and tension, kept my attention. However, it was Sasha Alexander that got me; her dimples and her eyes, and her complexion, were beautiful. Her on-screen presence was great.I guess I would not know what a good Gay film would look like but, this seems to be one of them from what I've been reading. We are saying Gay film now but, this is a kind of movie that may one day just be called a very well put together film, I hope so. I look forward to the intersection of the third sex, and the third eye, all in one serious cinematic masterpiece.Signed,""straight but, not narrow..."""
3,Good ....but get on with it already!,"This is a well done movie that is entertaining and engaging but too long. First one guy is interested in the other then something happens to ruin it then on again, then off, then on, then off.... Figure it out and make up your mind!The quality of the film is professional and it is well acted. Certainly worth a rental as you can probably find it at most larger or urban video stores but I would not necessarily add it to my collection."
5,"Not only entertaining, it is also touching !!!","If only amazon had 10 star-ratings, I would have easily stamped it all over this movie! ""All Over The Guy"" not only ia very entertaining, the movie also provides us with vivid realities about relationships. For whomever who is in the hunt for 'the special one' in their life; whom always looking for that 'perfect one'........ this movie will hit you close at home. I can't recommend it high enough. You just have to have this movie in your colllection racks. It's 'A_MUST' !!! Trust me !!! Peace !!"
3,"All Over The Guy,Story,Plotline,Predictableness,Etc.Etc.","I went to see ""All Over The Guy"" when it was playing at the art house theatre it was screened at and my overall opinion? If the two main characters were more structured I'd up my star rating up one. Ruccolo was indeed great but Bucatinsky often played games at times and made himself look like a a-hole at times. Sasha Alexander and Adam Goldberg were grrreat in their repsective supporting roles. It was nice to see Andrea Martin (I rarely see her in films nowdays) playing Ruccolo's Mom and cameos by Lisa Kudrow and Christina Ricci still kept my hopes up afloat on this movie."
3,There is better stuff out there.,"I was looking for a great guitar under $1000. This was in the running. Sat down at Guitar center with this, Fender strat (the cheap U.S. one $800) and a PRS SE. This felt cheap and the craftsmanship left something to be disired. Needless to say I went with the PRS SE, and I'm still blown away by it every time I plug it in.If you want a USA guitar save your pennies a little longer and buy a nice quality one instead of these cheapies."
1,Seashell rubber Mold,I was dissappointed in the size and sent this mold back. It is very small and so are the seashell holes.
5,DSCH's greatest symphony,"I am a newcomer to the world of Shotakovich, and this recording has definitely whetted my appetite. Under von Karajan's direction, the long, epic first movement bespeaks indescribable desolation and barrenness, with many passages that are positively chilling (eg. the clarinet melody). The scherzo and the waltz are appropriately demonic, and the final movement it as exciting and cathartic as one could desire - and with incredible virtuosity, I might add. Von Karajan and his forces show us why many experts consider the Tenth to be Shostakovich's greatest symphonic achievement."
2,He sounds 66,This is at best mediocre. Having heard him in person in the early sixties I find the 66 year old Sinatra constantly straining to reach notes. He was at his best in the 1950's. Quite a disappointment but he is 66.
4,Does the job inexpensively and efficiently,"As Washington State went hands free by law (good idea) I needed this for my old, by great performing, little Nokia. Easy to use and just a few bucks gets the job done. Definately a good choice if you need the above description."
4,"From quiet & idyllic, thru more dynamic & darker, to loud & heroic","This is a great sampler of the best compositions of Tchaikovsky - some being the all time classical hits - performed by the great orchestras and the top class conductors. The CD starts from very moody and peaceful music from the ballets, progresses through more dramatic pieces from the symphonies, and ends on the most dynamic and pressing compositions. So, there is a mood progression from quiet and idyllic, through more dynamic and darker, to loud and heroic. High quality digital mastering by Deutsche Grammophon resulted in a good volume and dynamic range (sound is loud and not muffled). It is worth every penny, if you could get your hands on it."
4,Karajan's Performance on Mahler's Ninth,"Karajan and Bernstein, I believe, are the two giant figures of the late 20th cnetury, except for the last 10 years, when it comes on conducting. And indeed, they are musically hostile to each other, diffrent countries, different ideas in music, and diffrent attitudes. I heard both Karajan's and Lenny's Performance with the Berlin Phil. Both are indeed fine. But I like Lenny's performance better. Besides, Bernstein is probably the best when it comes on Mahler, while Karajan on Beethoven. Overall, very good performance indeed. But I believe you should buy Lenny's performance with the Berlin Phil."
2,a bit dissapointed!,"When I looked this book over online, the inside had the old testament as well as the new testament. When I received the book I see that it is only the new testament. You are advertising this book incorrectly. If this is only the new testament, that is what should be advertised. I am a bit dissappointed that the old testament is not included."
4,NOT COMPLETELY OUT OF THE RUT BUT ALMOST THERE,"Finally, after more than a decade of putting up with his temper tantrums that would make Elton John blush, garcia makes an album that actually feature songs, not Casio pharts. Either his previous albums' falling sales numbers, or his inability to hold the public's attention without resorting to ridiculous publcity stunts (dating a 17 year old - he's 50+, or jumping 9 floors to a pool), have pushed him to make a somewhat decent album. This one, although far from his peak or creativity, is still a welcome addition to one's garcia collection. A CD one would not be embarrassed to have someone else find. 3.5 stars"
1,ONLY IF YOU'RE AN IMBECILE WITH A DRUG AND SELF-ESTEEM PROBLEM,"Why would anybody want to spend $114- for a CD with some half decent tracks, and a cardboard calendar printer in Argentina? ONly if you're an imbecile with a drug problem, a nihilistic view of life, and a rock bottom self esteem problem would you buy this $99- Casio demo product.Better yet, if you are one of those ""unconditionals"" that love junkie garcia no matter what, then somewhere in the city of buenos aires, a senior citizen will be killed for their money so that the junkie killer can wire transfer the stolen money to buy this aurical enema. The day will come, sooner than expected , when this junkie will die a pathetic, lonely and miserable death: gastritis and AIDS. Then his CDs will sharply rise in price, and more senior citizens will die at the hands of these ""unconditionals""."
2,Skeeter is Jar Jar Binks,"Rabbit Redux is by far the worst of the Rabbit series and for one reason - the character of Skeeter. Never have I read a book where the author allowed such an annoying character to hijack his story. What Jar Jar Binks (that annoying character who never shut up)was to Star Wars-The Phantom Menace, Skeeter was to Redux. After a while of putting up with the boring and endless rantings of this character, I began skipping pages. I hate doing that but I had no choice. I found that it didn't matter much anyway - nothing Skeeter said brought anything to this story, nor does it to the following two Rabbit booksThe book was good overall, but why did Updike have to devote so much of the story to Skeeter and his mindless rantings."
3,The Weakest Rabbit Book?,"This might be the weakest of the Rabbit books, but it still is essential reading for understanding his development and growth (or lack thereof) as a character. Updike really captures the spirit of the late 1960s in the book."
2,Disappointing,"Poorly researched and badly organized, this book is a huge disappointment. One of the most superficial works on this subject that I've read. Jackson seems to be resting on past successes and offers little new or fresh in this failed effort."
2,too bulky,"The scoop is too bulky, but does measure out the correct amount of food. If you have time, I would search for another scoop."
4,Intriguing book,"This book dicusses an intriguing thesis - that win/win scenarios (nonzero-sum cooperation) are primarily behind societal and cultural development, as opposed to win/lose (zero-sum competitive) scenarios.While the book is very thought-provoking, I feel that Wright glossed over significant information (he gives short shrift to the influence of religion, and ignores the development of constitutional democracy). He also makes a lot of generalizations and has a short and simplistic consideration of the nature of a supreme being. However, the book advances ideas that would be good for the author or others to fully develop in further, more detailed works."
4,A Great Book with a minor mistake...,"Since many reviewers have told various pros and cons of this book, I'd like to point out just one thing.In p. 341 (hardcover), the author shows a simplest form of nonzero game: the prisonner's dilemma. But the upper right part of this games should be ""You: 0 years Him: 10 years."""
5,Please release Season Two of S.W.A.T.,Season One of S.W.A.T.is not enough. It's time for you to give us Season Two already.
2,On Writing Short Stories,"Although the basic bones are good, I was looking for something not JUST to teach me, but to capture my attention enough to hold me and help me with my craft. Sadly this was not the book for me. I have found others that are far easier to follow and I am a very strong reader with good comprehension. Maybe I fell short, or maybe not? I won't return it, but it gets two stars for the effort of the author trying to help."
2,Probably not well shielded,"This cable works fine when all the equipment is turned on, but when my receiver is in standby mode, the subwoofer emits a constant low-pitch hum. Initially I thought it was a fault with my receiver but I tried it on two other receiver/subwoofer systems and had the same problem. I ending up buying another cable from radio-shack and it seems to work much better."
4,A good sturdy cable,"The cable delivered on time and as it looks in pictures, the cable is very sturdy and having good quality material.So far its doing its job well.The price is just right and I wouldn't get anything of this quality in stores for this price."
2,Could have been better,"This is a mesh of old and new. I've listened to it a few times and its a good cd. But, Joan sounds half way between bored and and trying to just throw a cd together. There are few high points,but certainly not worth the Import price!!! I bought the cd through the fanclub.The $12 downloaded version. I'm glad that I did. Its not worth more than that! Lets Hope Joan surprises us(If the new cd ever comes out!!!) with a whole new batch of songs soon! I have been a Fan since Bad Reputation and Her releases were the highlights of my Teenage years!But, This was a bit of a let down... I have the Demos of this cd and I believe most are much better than the newly recorded ""Naked"" versions! Do yourself a favor! If you buy this cd,buy it for the lesser Fanclub price! Hopefully a live cd will follow soon!"
2,A lack-lustre performance from VPO & Karajan,"Although this is not the worst recording of No. 5 that I've heard, I'm definitely disappointed with this Karajan recording. Compared to his earlier recording of the same work with BPO, this one with VPO is plain & mechanical. Tempos are generally fast but there is not much detail. The richness of this work is lost. This is uncharacteristic of a conductor of his class."
4,Thieves & Rip Off Artists....,"As an avid fan of the American Revolution, I have loved this series so far. It has brought the struggles of the people to life and gives us an idea of what they went through. However....to all you reseller's out there who are so obviously bent on ripping people off: I will invest in a Kindle and buy the ebook before I EVER pay the outrageous and ridiculous prices you are trying to get for the later volumes of this series. If a volume is not available on Kindle, I will be satisfied with what I have read to date and not finish the series."
3,For lovers of mathematics and logic.,It is a different and somewhat interesting book but it did not totally meet my expectations. I have read a few other books of this type and enjoyed them more.
2,Deeply Flawed-- Try Another Version,"This version of a magnificent work has never pleased me. Karajan seems to be flogging his orchestra -- the pace is way too fast for a work that is focused on mourning. Perhaps because the pacing is too aggressive, everyone performs as if they were terrified. The soloists acquit themselves very poorly on track 4. The bass starts everything off with an almost absurd rendition -- he sounds like a walrus choking on phlegm. One of the female vocalists, probably Anna Tomowa-Sintow, cannot sing the letter ""s"" without hissing -- she sounds ridiculous. Honestly folks, I'm not making this up -- I want to like the recording but it's impossible. Karajan has bequeathed us a disaster, puncutated only occasionally by flashes of the grandeur that could have been."
2,Elevator music,"Chris is to the trumpet what musak (sp.?)is to the elevator. It's not that he's not a proficient player--he is. It's that his music is so homoegenous and bland. It just drones on and on regardless of what he's playing. Too bad--he could be very creative and engaging, but not to these ears."
4,The black cat is hot,I really enjoyed this vol. but not being an elektra fan I wish spidey would have dished more out on her and the kingpin appeared just a bit to much of a an emotional blob at the end.
5,Dark and Intense,"This movie explores the complex and intense emotions involved in seeking revenge for unspeakable acts of degradation and humiliation. Excellent cast, amazing performances. Dark but compelling film."
4,Very interesting movie,"I am a fan of Sigourney Weaver and wanted this for my collection, it was more than I expected, quite an interesting and historical movie, very powerful."
2,Wanted to like this movie but......,There was something about this movie that was boring. I don't think the acting was anything special and Ms. Weaver...well. .She just didn't come across as a victim to me. The movie just didn't hang together.Others have given it rave reviews but I can't.
5,Great CD and really nice guys,"I bought this CD from a target store out here, and I didn't really know what to think-- I had downloaded an MP3 or two and had read some stuff about them online. I put the CD in my cd player in my car and I was pretty well blown away. The texturing that's created with the second guitar is amazing, and the lyrics are pretty heartfelt. I got to meet the band last night after a show in Albuquerque, NM w/systematic and stone sour, and they're extremely nice. Do yourself a favor, break away from the other cookie-cutter bands that are around right now, and buy this CD."
5,"Finally, Some Excellent Music From a Nu-Metal Band","Tired of the harsh sounds of today's Nu-Metal?(ala Korn, System of a Down, Taproot, etc.) Looking for a new metal band that's melodic yet still knows how to rock? Ra is the answer. With crisp guitar work and soaring vocals Ra has acheived a new metal masterpiece. The first five songs are so amazing that they will stick in your head all day and make you look forward to the next listen. The highmarks of the album include Only, Sky, Fallen Rock Zone and Do You Call My Name. The rest of the songs are merely great. Along with Saliva, Ra seems to embrace, rather than shun, metal pioneers of yesteryear(Dokken, Queensryche, Def Leppard, etc.) by actually doing some guitar solos. And the riffs still blow away most of those bands who don't know what a guitar solo is. Thank you Ra for reminding me what good hard rock music is all about - thoughtful lyrics, great vocals - and for putting the screech back into the guitar."
3,Definitely Geared Towards 15 Year Old Girls,"I assume this lead singer is very pretty and all the little girls love him and his 'sensitivity'... I never thought I'd hear emo-metal... but, here it is. Some of the songs would be best on Dr. Demento, like 'Skorn' which is just a silly novelty song. Other songs like 'Fallen Rock Zone' offer us encapulated, easily digestable women's lib for those who are not yet women...I guess the main problem I have with Ra is the singer... with a voice much closer to 70's 'please the girls'-metal, like later Foreigner or Asia, than anything that actually fits the heavy alternative genre which musicially, Ra fits into. His voice is too high, too 'trained' for this style.I really don't see Ra going anywhere, just another bland band for the record company machine. This just sounds too much like christian metal to me, you know, the sound is ok, but, the vibe is just completely off."
4,hotel buff s dream,The Dvd is a little dated but well worth watching. The presenter gushes over the Waldorf=Astoria. I recently stayed here so it was nice trip down memory lane.
1,No English subtitles,I wasted my money renting this title and it is entirely in Korean with no English subtitles.
1,Hip Li'l Schlock,"Absolutely dreadful. Over produced. Unimaginative. A real shame. When the live CD came out in 1998, we said that's cool because they did a tour. But some of us asked ""Are you going to do something new?"". Apparently not. They ruined ""Follow Your Heart"" in 1976 and now they've done it again with ""Swim"". I love Bill Champlin's voice, but all those years playing with Chicago shows. We use to take LP's that we hated and smash them on the pavement. This CD deserves to be in a skeet shooting contest."
1,It just sux.,"Don't read the other reviews. Authors surely didn't play Starcraft before. Here is a quote from the guide (p. 17): ""Vulture is a hovercycle that's fast, powerful, and very effective when quick response time is critical... very effective, when you are defending a sprawling base"". Vultures are useless against everything except infantry. The ""easy to follow general strategies"" are general strategies, which is almost impossible to use against human opponent. No strategy guide gives you info on a building order for fastest development."
3,A good book that could have been better,"This is what it lacks (1) It's missing information on the unit table. (2) It has little to say on such matters as multiplayer (battle.net) startegies (4 pages) out of it's 246. (3) It also lacks good advice for map triggers, most of which I (and most people) learned about from basically testing and practicing. It's good if your starting off or want to beat the game legitly. I like the cooldown/range info on the units."
4,teaser!,"what a teaser! Just when u are getting into one of the story, its over! but i guess that is what u can expect from and anthology."
2,not worth my time or money,"The only good thing about this book is the Sherilyn Kenyon story. Everything else was either boring, stupid, or a combination of both. I am very disappointed with this book."
3,My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding,"I purchased this book for the short story by Jim Butcher. It goes with the Harry Dresden series and I had to know what Harry got into this time. I look forward to reading the other works, hoping to find more authors to pursue."
2,A Disappointing Introduction,"I picked up several anthologies at once on my last trip to the book store. I love them, since they give you a nice sampling of the work of various authors, and has led me to some great books in the past. Unfortunately, none of the authors listed here are showcasing anything I'd buy.The first story was so laden with painful dialogue that fell somewhere between ebonics and redneck slang that I nearly had to put it down. I persevered, but was not rewarded for my efforts. I won't speak to all the stories, only suffice it to say that none of the writers did their best work here - I hope.I highly recommend you do not waste the money."
4,Came just as expected.,I had no complaints with the product. It was just as advertised and came within expected time. I'd do business again.
1,SKIPPING!!,"Bought The Wire boxset (new) watched 1st disc no issues, started to really enjoy it and put on the 2nd disc which is awful wont stop skipping!It is actually unwatchable now and cant continue the show as cant watch 2 episodes on disc 2 season 1!"
2,"Terrible packaging, defective discs","Arrived promptly from Amazon, shrink-wrapped. Discs are just shoved into cardboard slots. All five discs from Season Two are unusable. Talked it over with Abdul in India. Would not let me send back only bad discs for replacement. Had to RMA the whole set of 23 for replacement. Instead, they just refunded my Goldbox price.Great HBO series; terrible HBO manufacturing; disappointing service."
4,One of the Best shows ever,"This is one of the best shows I've ever watched, and I've seen my share. If you haven't seen the show, please try it out as you will not be disappointed. There is no main character, just an amazing flow of characters who intertwine brilliantly. It shows you the struggle of life on the street in Baltimore while also showing you the affect of Police, Government, School and Print Media. Some of those subjects might not seem like they're very exciting, but the way this story plays out makes you so interested in all of the characters and what they do. The ONLY bad thing about this is the DVD packaging. The set comes in paper boxes with plastic wrapped around the 23 DVDs. If you get a change, I would buy the newer box set that's a little more expensive but has actual DVD cases and protects everything better."
1,DVD has skipped tracks and imperfections,"I purchased the entire 5 seasons of The Wire. So far I have seen the first season. The final episode of the first season had multiple imperfections and skipped tracks, making it impossible to figure out what was going on."
5,"The greatest television show, period.","Many have called The Wire the greatest dramatic television show ever made. I think it is the greatest television show EVER made, period. The depth in the story and characters can't be found in another show, and probably never will. The acting is incredible, from the main characters, to smaller characters. And it is also hilarious in parts, once again due to the suberb writing, acting and direction. Do yourself a favor and check this out, because the mold was broken after The Wire was made."
5,The Wire,Stunning in approach and portrayal. The streets can be mean and yet compassionate. The Wire depicts the struggles we read and hear about and puts them into a visual reality.
4,ps3 wouldn't play 4:3 but great show,"Bought it based on friends recommendation, great show. Oddly PS3 fat 60g wouldn't play at 4:3 and tv cut off picture when at that setting but an old dvd player was fine.edit Nov 2012: Stupid me, it was an improper setting on the ps3 that played wrong aspect ratio. Great series."
1,The Wire,I order plenty of dvd's from Amazon... Sad part is because I work and have a family I don't always get to view them in a timely fashion. My purchase of The Wire Season 5 is flawed and can not be viewed. WILL YOU STILL REPLACE IT???????????????????
1,"the wire defective,","Dear Sir, I purchased the Wire as a Christmas present, I just heard that it was defective, it will be returned to me and I hope that I can exchange it or be reumbured.The Wire: The Complete Series"
1,HORRRIBLE,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON.... THE ITEM NEVER GOT SHIPPING, AND WHEN I WENT TO CONTACT THE PERSON, HE DOESNT RECIEVE MESSAGES IR EMAILS....BOGUS! IM GOT MY MONEY BACK... HE SHOULD BE BANNED FROM AMAZON. DONT FALL FOR HIS GOOD PRICES- HE IS A LOW LIFE THAT IS TRYING TO STEAL MONEY!"
1,Best Show on Television...But...,"By far, the best show on television. Even before I bought the complete set, I've watched and rewatched every episode a number of times.BUT, why did HBO have to ruin that with cheap packaging and full screen format. I'm sure that the could have put the DVD's in better packaging. The package it came in had a big UPS code flier thing glued to the back of the box and rips a layer off the box as you try to take it off. The DVD's are separated by seasons but are in bad cardboard holder that (could) scratch as you take out the disc. Also, I'm not sure how they divided up each season on to the disks... some have 2 episodes, others have 4, which I think was to the degradation of quality of the picture. It would also have been nice to have the show in wide screen, or in hi quality format.That all being said, watch the show any way you can (have a friend burn you a copy or something... the quality would be the same)... Then wait if a better version comes out in the future."
1,Terrific show. Terrible DVD.,"I should've read the other reviews before purchasing, but I didn't. That said, as soon as I pulled these out of the packaging and inserted into the DVD player they began skipping. The DVD's are impossible to watch in there entirety, which is extremely frustrating. Not only can I not watch the DVD's, I'm no longer able to return them to get my money back because the packaging has been opened.If you want to watch The Wire, do yourself a favor and buy the set season by season. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SET!!!!"
1,Worst Packaging,"This is a great show, but the other reviews that complain about the packaging and DVD cases are completely right. This is the worst packaging I have ever seen a DVD come in."
1,Defective product,"Out of the box, I have had problems playing disks after the middle of the first disk of the second season. Some episodes are unplayable. The disk surface appears fine, the disks are simply defective. Very disappointing. In my opinion, the return policy is not long enough when you have a multi-season box set of disks."
5,"Arguable, the best television series, ever.","I bought this, having already watched it all on HBO. This is, in my opinion, one of the best, if not the best, television series of all time. Incredible characters and character development. Thought provoking topics and plots. And gritty, engaging drama.My only complaint is that I seemed to remember watching this series in widescreen... I could be wrong, because I had a standard def TV at the time, but the dvds are not in widescreen.Other then that, incredible series and great value here on Amazon."
5,The Wire Series,I am very pleased with the service provided by the seller. Contact was made with the seller and they provided additional service to make me more satisfied with the purchase experience.
4,Best show ever put on TV,Fabulous opportunity to own and view this great series again. Well worth the price.
5,One of the best shows ever,"The Wire is without question one of the greatest television shows ever produced. The show has unparalleled realism, instantly likable characters, and a story arc like no other."
4,"Great shape, shipping took a while","Great price and great product, only beef is that it took quite a while to get to me."
2,I Agree With Hurwitz.,"Beethoven's 3rd Symphony happens to be my favorite piece of classical music. I bought this recording because I had heard rave reviews about Levine's work, but I am disappointed with this rendition of the 3rd. Both Bernstein and von Karajan have more masterful recordings of Eroica. Both are on DG. This isn't bad, but it can't compare with others out there."
3,Not the worse,"I am still convinced that the first 3 Sookie Stackhouse Books were the best. After that it seemed that Charlaine Harris was sort of struggling to find a way to keep the story interesting. She seems conflicted about whether to have Sookie as sweet, innocent and not super bright or a bitch, hot to trot and just plain dumb. Sookie's many male relationships are getting tiring. Sookie also is becoming the stereotypical damsel in distress. By Defintetly Dead you know she is going to get the crapped beat out of her at least once and just barely make it out of some situation alive. Also in Definitely Dead there are many background stories that are referred to yet not explained in earlier books. That was a little puzzling. I liked the book ok but it was really mindless fluff reading. I will eventually read the rest of the series ( luckily they are easy enough to read them over a few evenings)but my enthusiasm for them is waning."
5,My Favorite Series,"Longer than earlier novels in the series, Definitely Dead was a good read. If you haven't read the earlier novels, I urge you to go back before reading this one. They're amusing and highly entertaining. Definitely Dead answers some questions that have been left hanging for some time, and it leaves some doors open for future developments. Charlaine introduces some new characters who seem to be sticking around for a while, and that's a good thing. I'm pleased with the outcome for now, and I don't think anyone should write off Eric the Viking Vampire just yet. However, hopefully, we can close the book on Debbie Pelt. I can't wait to read the next or see the TV show!"
2,confusing,"I adore this series, but this book was confusing as heck. Throughout the whole thing I kept feeling like I was missing something. I have read the books in order, but the story kept referring to a past adventure that was not clear. I couldn't get over the feeling that I had amnesia and the story kept jerking me around with references to things that had gone before. From other reviews, I see that I missed an anthology story between books. This book definitely needs an ""authors note"" to explain where that story can be found. It actually made me angry to read this, I felt so lost. Don't read this one out of order!!"
4,a book to sink your teeth into!,"The Sookie Stackhouse novels are fun, fast reads. Mind candy for the person who enjoys a little fantasy in their lives. Charlaine Harris has the reader believing that vampires are people too, or at least they used to be, and in 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' style she brings some wit and wisdom to bare as we follow the barmaid who is 'stacked' on her adventures. The novels for the most part take place in Bon Temps; a southern community with a cast of memorable characters. And characters they are. These novels are a hoot."
4,Sookie is maturing!,"Sookie Stackhouse is a cocktail waitress and telepath. Her love life is a mess, people are being murdered in her yard and Sookie has to go to New Orleans as she has inherited her Cousin Hadley's estate. This isn't easy as Hadley was consort to the vampire Queen of New Orleans and not everyone wants her there.I love this series. DEFINITELY DEAD, to me, was a really good story, and one that let Sookie grow and mature. The humor was there, as was the tension and suspense. But in this book, Sookie experienced emotional hurt and passion, both of I believed and felt. I did feel I was missing some information and learned some of the characters had been introduced in a short story. Even so, it didn't take away from the books strengths. The bigger problem for me is that I have to wait another year for the next book. For those who are fans of this genre, I highly recommend it, but start with the first book and read them in order."
2,Whats going on.,"I am only 20% into this book and can't tell you how disappointed I am. I too thought I started the wrong book because so much was missing. After reading other reviews I found that there is some other story floating around out there that explains things. How stupid. My BIG pet peeve is that the author keeps giving background info on everyone and everything like we never read the first 5 books. I have been waiting for Eric or any vampire for that matter. Its all shifters and wolves. I want to read about the vamps. I find myself paging through not really reading just trying to finish it. In addition, I must say that I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the ending of the series. After reading reviews for the last book I find it hard to care."
5,love it,This is a fun read and the author knows how to get them to come alive and entertain and make you not put it down.
5,Great saw,"OK, I admit it. I'm a circular saw junkie. I have just about every one currently on the market. And other than the Bosch with wormdrive and the Porter trim saw, this is my favorite saw. And for general use, this is the saw I reach for the most often. I just built a hutch compound for some of my animals with my Makita and I hated when the project was done. I wanted to keep sawing. This saw is light and durable and when paired with the DeWalt blades, it is amazing to use. As to the bevel limitations, they have never become an issue with this saw. I just use a miter saw or a trim saw for angles over 45 degrees."
4,Good value,Pros:Solid constructionLots of powerCons:Miter scale hard to readIndexing guide on base plate is not accurate (watch the blade relative to the cut line).Brake is inconsistent.
5,Just Great !,"I've heared Cowboy for the first time on Gregg Allman's Album ""On Tour '74"". The second time I have heared them on Bonnie Bramlett's album ""It's time"" (also a great album). And now I'm owning ""Reach For The Sky"" and it's just great - one ""Hit"" after another, especially the song ""It's time"". Trust an Austrian music lover and buy this CD !! I would like to have more music from BOYER/TALTON."
2,Made in China,"Same experience as the other review: Made in China. The knife is also different from the picture, its a plastic handled razor-type."
2,Underperforms,"This book had the potential to be very very good and frankly fell short. The author, rather than follow the various players with anecdotes, instead seems to write the same paragraph over and over again about how the players had trouble coping with real life situation as a result of being coddled in high school. I've read books about individual players and most authors will let you live those players lives through events they faced over a period of years. This book is just way short on actual events. i.e. ""Darryl's AA coach too easily looked the other way while Darryl failed to give 100%. They were awed by Darry'l potential etc."" I'd much rather hear about an actual game where Darryl failed to cut a ball off in the gap resulting in extra base hits and the following the game went out slept w/ X, Y and Z and did Q drugs.Not a terrible book, just very disapointing."
5,"A gripping, moving book","There are readers who will devour this book because they are passionate Mets fans, or Darryl Strawberry fans, or baseball lovers in need of eloquent baseball literature every spring. But this book is so much more than the cover seems to promise: I got caught up in the human drama of the characters' lives. I read it in two sittings, and I could barely put it down. And I'm a woman! Sokolove looks at these former high school stars--now black men turning 40--with a clear eye and a full heart. A great yarn."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I am not a huge fan of gory horror, so I'm always looking for a really scary movie. This is not it. Pointless T & A, unfinished storylines...just not scary like I'd hoped. This film just does not live up to all the hype (people had to leave the screening? Fainted? Hardly.) Not worth the price, just wait for regular release. Disappointed."
3,Was good,"Cheap ""B"" movie taken to a higher level.Liked it, enjoyed it, got my money's worth.I would recommend to people that wasnt a cheap thrill and something our of the ordinary."
1,S/M/H,"Don't waste your time or money. This turd of a movie should've never found it's way out of the toilet bowl. Trust me, the scariest thing here is the price of this stinker, @ $9.99, it's $10 too much! The one good thing about this movie? I saw it in the privacy of my own home, so nobody but me, myself & I (& the select few I saw it with) knows how stupid I am for renting it! :D"
1,Avoid This Disaster!!,"Please step away from this monstrosity, which rightfully deserves no stars. I only made it through 15 minutes of the film before trashing it. It is so poorly made, that it makes you nauseous watching the horrible camera work. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ANYONE!!! The positive reviews must be from people associated with this crap! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,caveat emptor,"Before I begin, I shall share a quote from the author of the Dictionary of the English Language, Samuel Johnson, ""Worth seeing? Yes, but not worth going to see."" I shall also forego the synopsis to avoid redundancy. In short, V/H/S amounts to a barrage of nonlinear free association. As others have mention in previous reviews, the frustration lies in the fact we have several intriguing storylines that never come into fruition. It seemed like a case of to many cooks In the kitchen. That and why what appeared to be digital footage was discovered on VHS tapes. Being a huge fan of bloody-disgusting.com i was a bit shocked to say the least."
2,Probably better in theory than execution,"Another weak attempt at first person horror, lots of potential but fell very short. Kind of disappointed because I loved House of the Devil so much."
2,Very disappointed,"With all the hype around this movie I decided to pay for the pre-release rental and I'm very disappointed. I've seen old episodes of Tales from the Crypt which were better.The acting is horrible in almost every single ""tape"" (save for the last two which I liked). Also, I know this was an anthology movie with different stories to tell, but I didn't realize they were trying to tell six separate stories in less than two hours. Maybe I'm not the right audience, but I when I did start to get sort of interested in a story it was over.As I mentioned I did like the last two stories. The Skype-style tape was interesting from the beginning and showed a lot of promise, but the ending was really out there.The last tape with the costume party gone wrong was a lot of fun. I wouldn't mind seeing an extended version of that while dropping one or two of the other stories."
1,Dumb,What a stupid movie. I would not expect Amazon to sell something like this. I watched about five minutes of it and turned it off.Was very disappointed
1,Waste of time,"I bought this movie on demand for $11.00 in hd thinking that this was going to be a really cool horror film that was going to be like creepshow... the movie comes with 5 different stories (I think it was five)... the problem here is that all 5 stories sucks a@#,they all suffer from bad acting, bad writing, and bad stories. If you want to see a good movie with 5 different stories check out creepshow and hell check out creepshow 2. creepshow 2 wasn't that great but was a hell of a lot better than V/H/S. But I will admit V/H/S was better than the direct to video sequel creepshow 3 that movie was a piece of s@#$ Overall not worth a buy maybe check it out if its free and you're curious but in the future if I see it on TV for free I will find something better on."
1,Horrible movie,"Wow what can I say? This movie was really bad,don't waste your money. Completely pointless,I wouldn't even recommend this movie for free. My 12 year old son could make something better in his school."
2,Typical of the low-budget horror,"The format for this is similar to other ""filmed with a camcorder"" movies like the Blair Witch Project. While the effects are good enough, it drags on a bit (I didn't finish the whole movie) and the subject matter is very dark. These type of movies are cheap thrills, but it begs the question of what we are filling our heads with. Disturbing enough for an adult; should not be viewed by a teenager (or younger), but suspect this is the type of movie they like and seek out on the video-on-demand format."
1,Waste of time,"I love horror movies and they're practically the only genre I watch. This movie however was a disgrace to the genre. I heard it was a good movie from a friend but when I watched it it turned out to just be another gory, stupid, no making sense movie. None of the stories were interesting and the major plot was disorganized and made no sense. Don't waste your time with this movie."
1,"""LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS""? What a lie","They should have an editor for the descriptions. Apparently they allow anyone to say anything they want if it will sell the movie. This was a high-schoolish effort to make a horror film, but then they put some shite about how it is so scary you might pass out. This is misleading advertising to sell a film that will never hit a theatre and it seems Amazon was out to fleece a regular customer out of their money."
3,Forget the price...,"Nothing has topped the Quartet Italiano's full Mozart cycle; and a close listening to both those and this CD reveals where Emerson went wrong. A Mozart quartet is a very gentle, delicate being, and yet the Emersons attack it going not soft and gentle but from quiet to loud in an instant, as if that communicates emotion. You can tell each of them wants to have their part recorded equally as others rather than as a single entity. In a word, they do not treat Mozart with the care he requires. Mozart's anger or angst was sublimated into his music, and his life, and always with an ironic light element to it. Here the Emersons just attack and think loud is identical to passionate, emotional. It is not. Buy the whole set in the Complete Mozart Edition, which I keep going back to even with all the recordings of these quartets I have."
4,The Horse and His Boy,"This book was the third book of the Chronicles of Narnia. It was about a boy named Shasta who was a slave of a fish trader. At his house one day came a Royal King. He had to go outside to sleep and he was alamermed by the Kins horse, who was tlaking to him. The horse named Bree wanted to escape from his owner just as Shata did. They escaped that night to the north. The horse told him about this place called Narnia were all the animals could talk. Sahsta and Bree went on there journey to Narnia. On there way there they encountered another talking horse named Hwin and her rider Aravias also escaping to Narnia. They went on there journey together. They got caught in a dilema with the Prince of a city called Tashbaan. They escaped from there to make it into Narnia were they met other talking anomals and rejoice with the creatures of this world."
4,Good adventure book,"I thought that this book is a good one because of the adventure that this boy goes on to be free. The adventure has many different parts and problems, and that's what makes it exciting. I didn't give it a fifth star because there are just a few talking and planning parts that could be a little boring. The action and the battling, I think, makes up for most of the boring parts though. This is probably a good book for almost any age of reader. It has a sort of fantasy type setting in some parts of the story, and a war type setting in other parts of the book. I would recommend it!"
3,The Horse and His Boy,I personally feel that this ia an awsome book. With very captivating writing and descriptive details. I give it three stars because he could have left out some of the conversations if you can call them conversations between Shasta(Cor)and Arvis. In the end he could have went into detail about Cor and Arvis' life together.
5,Excellent live recording!,"This is how the Beethoven concertos should be played - with majesty and grandeur. After buying this Pollini recording, I find other recordings lacking in these aspects. If you are going to buy one recording of the concertos, this should be it. The live aspect, I think, is not really noticeable. Maybe one or two audience coughs but that is to be expected. These interpretations of Pollini are too good to turn down based on the fact that it's a live recording. This set includes the DEFINITIVE recording of the 4th Concerto. I challenge anyone to find a better performance. Pollini knows Beethoven, trust me. I've listened to over 20 different interpretations and in my opinion Pollini's performances here come the closest to the composer's intentions. The Berlin Philharmonic does an excellent job with the accompaninent as well. Not to be missed!"
2,Really??,"Dumb. Lack of decent plot. The main actor was annoying the whole film, I was hoping he'd get assassinated...and Angelina's acting ability was lost on this part. I was very dissapointed."
1,A loom? are you serious?,"This movie is offensively bad. I mean really, really incredibly stupid. Watch it just to laugh at it. This movies success is proof of de-evolution. Who likes stuff like this? Finger painting monkeys could have written a better story. This is a perfect example of everything I don't like about modern action movies.I'd site specific reasons why I think this movie is so bad, but I don't want to ""spoil it"" (ha! like it could get worse) for anyone who hasn't witnessed the idiocy-made-flesh that is this abomination.You want to see a good action movie? Watch Dirty Harry. I know it's old and not as flashy, but it has things like acting and a story that makes sense. As far as something more recent, I didn't love Transporter, but compared to this it was poetic genius. Uwe Boll must LOVE this movie."
2,No plot,"What is wrong with having a plot? It would have elevated this series of action scenes into a movie. Even a thin plot would have been better than the miniscule one barely smeared on here. All that money spent on something that has no lasting power except to elevate the heart rate of some teenage boys, but which they will soon forget."
5,worth every penny,Angelia Julie is so cool in this movie. It's my favorite movie all the time. It's a must-see movie for every julie-lover.
1,What?,"I adore Angelina but this movie had to be one of the stupidest I had seen since I saw Hancock, which was worse. What was the summer of 2008, the summer of the worse, most lame movies ever? It looks like it was."
1,Stupid...Spoiler Alert!!!,"Stupid is the word for this movie. Good special effects and all. Even the ending almost had me as if I might be watching an original theme/plot. However at the very end it comes up with the most lame ending of all. The main character says ""I was once like you, pathetic.."" or something close to that. First of all, since when do regular people need to become assassins? It makes it sound as if being a mother, father, policeman, doctor, sound bad. He already has a special gift that 99.9 percent of the rest of the world doesn't have. Second, the laws of gravity makes it impossible to send a bullet travelling at high speeds to spin into a complete circle?!?! FART!!!!Morgan Freeman is a wonderful actor. I don't know how he got into this POS movie."
4,Not Bad,"My biggest beef with this story was that Angelina Jolie got top billing and as far as I'm concerned, she was just a secondary character. I guess her status gets her top billing even if she has a three-second walk-on. She has a substantial part, no doubt, but James McAvoy is the real star here, and he did a pretty decent job.The story was certainly not what I expected! I thought it was going to be a conventional cops-chasing-the-bad guy type of thing, but instead it was about super assassins, with Matrix-like super powers. That being said, the movie was a lot of fun.Though I like Angelina Jolie, I don't like the fact she got top billing while the real star of this movie was tucked in there behind her name. This is the nature of marketing and show business, I guess. Overall, still a good movie and a great vehicle for James McAvoy. Recommended."
2,could not get past the first 20 minutes,"Not sure why I am reviewing this as movies are so subjective and no one is right or wrong but boy, was this movie over the top. Way too far fetched for me. Way to un-realistic for my tastes...My fiance' and I both agreed at the same time...lets turn it off."
2,Gratuitous Violence,If you want to watch gratuitous violence and hackneyed plot this is the movie for you. Angelina Jolie has played so many whiplash women parts I'm beginning to think she isn;t acting she's just being herself. Boo!
3,Stylish fun - leave your brain at the door,"Fast and flashy, ultra-violent action fest with curving bullets, colliding bullets, bullets ripping through foreheads, big guns, little guns, car chases, breathtaking train sequence, you get the picture. For the most part, the cast is enjoyable although lead James McAvoy is very irritating. The film as a whole makes little sense and is mind-numbing unbelievable but if rip roaring special effects and action are your thing, you will probably enjoy it. Looks great on Blue-Ray!"
3,Hmmmm....worth a rent I guess,"Combine spectacular special effects, an original screenplay, well-developed characters, and a suspenseful plot line and you get The Matrix. Take all that out except leave in the special effects and you get Wanted. I will admit the special effects were fun to watch but all the f bombs and violence in the world couldn't save the lame characters and awful story that came with it. Believe me they tried. Rent it. Watch it. Have fun with it...and forget about it soon after."
3,Decent enough,"Decent storyline, tons of special effects, lots of killing. Just what you would expect. No surprises here if you purchased this."
2,This movie needs to be deleted - I have seen it in the loom,"The reviews of this movie seem to be roughly divided in two categories: 1. I like the action of the movie and 2. I think it's stupid. For me, despite some funny ideas and decent action (I liked the train scene close to the end), the movie certainly fits into the second category. Because there is just too much stuff going on where I didn't want to follow (mild spoilers ahead): the main characters believe that fate is written in a loom, bullets can fly in circles, some men can accelerate to 200 m/h by foot and slow down their subjective time but don't see crosshairs on the floor, etc., etc.My suggestion: save your time and money for better superhero movies like Spiderman, Batman, The Incredible Hulk, X-Men, etc., etc."
5,wanted,"Really enjoyed this movie. The action and special effects were well done and fit into the story. Also liked the themes of finding you destiny, living up to a legacy and taking responsability for your life. Great flick."
2,wanted,"The service was excellent. I didn't enjoy the movie. Wasn't very good acting and the plot wasn't very good, it rambled too much."
5,Ideas for Every Situation,"Maran Illustrated Dog Training explores a full range of situations, everything from what to do when you first adopt a puppy to how to train your dog to accept a new pet or even adapt to having a new baby in the house.

1,Olympus Mistake,This machine was purchased to replace an analog tape recorder for meetings. It was unusable both in sound quality and software design. It was returned and a Model DS-330 was purchased.
2,Disappointment,"I bought this record a year ago together with Hotel Costes 2&4 based on one of the reviews here on Amazon, however, I was disapointed and I am still very unlucky about this purchase. There are some bright tracts but it is boring and cheesy. Try those two HCs, they are excellent, clever, inspiring, including a lot of styles and rhytmes...."
1,Do not buy this machine!!!!!,"I have had this machine for less than a year and it has stopped pumping cleaning solution. I have tried to call customer service several times, but they just keep telling me to prime the pump, which works for all of 5 minutes (if I'm lucky). My only other options are to send it back to them and wait for a replacement (remanufactured) or drive almost 25 miles to the nearest service center. I have a friend who has a Bissell as well and the same thing happened to their machine. I will defintely shop for a different brand next time."
1,Another piece of Junk,"I bought this machine to replace a Bissell I THOUGHT my mother had broken. I now know that it is nothing more than a piece of JUNK. After less than a year I smelled a burning smell and took it in for service. NINETY EIGHT dollars later it was fixed but less than a year later I am faced with a broken machine. SAME parts! It doesn't spray and the power lifter has no power! As a matter of fact...it doesn't work at all! I would NEVER buy another Bissell product. This isn't a Target problem, this is a BISSELL problem. BE AWARE...DON'T BUY!"
2,Works well on mildly soiled carpets...before it breaks...,"I've used this machine three times in the year and a half I've had it. Although this machine worked well on cleaning overall, I still had to work by hand on higher traffic areas. It is heavy and sometimes difficult to maneuver for me. It certainly still beats a rentable version, or paying a professional carpet cleaner if your carpets aren't heavily soiled. Unfortunately, shortly after its first year of use, I went to turn it on and it would no longer spray detergent. My boyfriend is someone I would consider quite handy, and he has taken it apart twice finding nothing visibly wrong or repairable to fix the problem. I would not consider this product a reliable investment unless you're willing to buy a new one every couple of years."
2,Complete piece of junk,"This machine worked great when I first bought it. After five uses, it would no longer shoot out water or suck it back up. The belt broke several times. I clean houses for a living and it died on me and I had to rent a cleaner from a nearby store. Complete waste of $. Nowhere near me even sells the parts to fix it and I have to buy them directly from the manufacturer. Can we say 'scam artists'? Buyer Beware. Don't say that I didn't warn you."
2,Dissapointed,I bought this machine and it cleans great but the water tank LEAKS BAD!!! I took it back and exchanged it for another one thinking that it was just that machine. The second and the third one both leaked in the same place. Needless to say I don't plan on buying anything else with the word bissell on it!!
2,Interesting,"If Joan Jett knew how bad these sounded, she would have bought the rights to this recording and burned them. Its not even close, and she hardly tries. Better to have left this one as a ""shower"" session. Love her other works, am a fan."
4,Joan does some covers,"Joan Jett is a great performer and this project has all the ingrediants needed to be a winner. Joan is not a great singer, but her attitude shows through and she makes these versions her own. However, her cover of Dirty Deeds is probably the worst I've ever heard. In hundreds of garage bands I've played with, this song always comes up and gets played. Sometimes it sounds good, sometimes it was terrible. But that's a garage band. Joan next time do your homework. For one she leaves out over half the lyrics, and the backup chorus is so weak, it would almost sound better if it wasn't there at all. This version will have Bon Scot spinning in his grave for years. The rest of the album is great though, from CCR to Hendrix. Again except for Dirty Deeds, this would have been a 5 star album."
3,good collection of covers.,"""The Hit List"" #36 (1990).Last charting album by Joan. Joan covers 10 classics, she does a great job on the AC/DC tune ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"" #36 hot 100 #23 MSR, the Pistols ""Pretty Vacant"", nice reading of The Kinks ""Celluloid Heroes"", her version of ""Up From The Skies"", is good, could it be Joan's favorite album by Hendrix is ""Axis: Bold As Love""?, as she covered ""You Got Me Floating"" in 1986. And she does a wonderful job on the Modern Lovers classic ""Roadrunner"". 1991 brought us new material in ""Notorious""."
5,WWF Survivor Series,"This has to be one of the most important Pay-Per-Veiws in WWF history. It is the night that the Alliance (WCW & ECW, both of which are now owned by the WWF) went out of business. This is a must have for any WWF fan!"
3,WWF Survivor Series 2001,"Its nice to see that the WWF put extras on this DVD, something they have forgotten to do lately. Here are the matches and ratings.WWF European Championship: Christian vs. Al Snow - **1/4Tajiri vs. Alliance Commissioner William Regal - *1/2Championship Unification Match: Edge (WCW U.S. Champion) vs. Test (WWF Intercontinental Champion) - ***Steel Cage Tag Team Unification Match: Hardy Boyz (WWF Tag Team Champions) vs. Dudley Boyz (WCW Tag Team Champions) - **3/4Immunity Invitational Battle Royal Match: Featuring 22 WCW & WWF Superstars - **Six-Pack Challenge for the Women's Championship: Lita vs. Jacqeuline vs. Trish vs. Ivory vs. Mighty Molly vs. Jazz - *Team WWF vs. Team Alliance Winner-Take-All Elimination Match: The Rock, Chris Jericho, Undertaker, Kane, Big Show vs. Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Shane McMahon - ****"
3,A PLEASER,"This is my first outing w/Ms. Massey, and I agree it is a fascinating look at Japanese customs. The outsider status of an American-Japanes person is deftly handled. I particularly liked the problems Rei had with reading Japanese. It is perfectly understandable that a girl educated in the US would not be adept with Japanese symbols, if you think about it. I just never did. This affects Rei's everyday life, and Ms. Massey never lets us forget it. Not only did Rei have to solve the crime, she had to run around and get someone to read the newspaper to her. When she went out to dinner, she couldn't read the menu. This gave the story an added bit of realism.The mystery was not as well done. It was diffused by the romance, the family, the shop-till-you-drop (dare I say airhead?) personality of Rei. She put forth some offbeat potential villains, but didn't put in the effort to make this a rousing whodunit. By the time Rei solves the mystery, I didn't much care, and I don't think she did either."
2,"Great Idea, cheap execution","Great concept, good design. One problem. They filled it about 1/3 or 1/4 full, which means, you can cook about 2 hotdogs. I had to take the top off and add charcoal to make it useful for even a couple of people's meals. Cheapness destroys the product."
1,Useless item,These grills were useless. I bought several for a tailgating party. There were about 4 chunks of charcoal in each which did not even come close to lighting using the paper bag they were enclosed in. I broke open three grills and put all the charcoal together and lit it with some charcoal lighter. I will never even think about buying these again!
2,This book Read Like Fiction Because-------,"one cannot imagine how anyone could have lived this kind of life in ""real life"". I think the book is well written from the standpoint that the author leads you to believe for quite a while that there are separate people involved when in reality this lady was clearly a multiple personality; I found myself frustrated by Mr. Goetzke's inability to pick up that fact early on; this is a man who was the head of bank security no less. I found myself angry with the author as I would feel towards a woman who continued to take abuse and stick around for more; because of this I became disenchanted with the book and skimmed the last 100 pages because I frankly became tired of his descriptions of Lauren's multiple villainous characters emerging, while Mr. Goetzke indulged and tried to placate this lunatic. This book proves once again that truth is stranger than fiction."
4,"An hour-long ""Iron Man""","Imagine if Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" were an hour long, with scarce vocals, and with only two chords. Now a stoner metal classic, ""Jerusalem"" accomplishes this with one long, plodding track. Despite the mind-numbing repetition (or perhaps because of it), this album is fairly interesting throughout. Matt Pike's guitar tone is raw, massive, and very electric. This is the type of album where one can leave the room for a bit and come back without missing anything."
5,Through these fires,"I had never read this book before , it was a great Grace Livingstion Hill book. The book came in great shape and in a speedy manner. Thank you."
4,"Great Item, Need Size Description","The item came in the same colors as described. However, it is quite large (at least 4 feet by 3 feet). I wish this was in the product description. Other than that, the product is great. The poles at each end of the banner are even removable to make it just a flag. Overall, a good purchase."
5,Fun and beautirul Ty Angel White Himalayan Cat,"This cat was bought as a gift for a friend's child. The time was an important of this order; happily, it was sent and received most expediently. Thank you for your excellent service!"
2,Well ....,"I read this book with all the best intentions. At times, I had to force myself to keep reading. The book was an interesting tale of hardships and triumphs. Though I was not always interested in the book, it always drew a strong response. It is important to realize that people are not always who you think they are, the person sitting next to you might have some deep, dark secrets you could never imagine. Though I may not recommend the book, I am very glad I read it. The book will give you an insight to people's pasts, the likes of which you could never imagine."
2,I don't see it...,"I read this book for my book club, and I do not understand why it is so popular. I find the writing style to be elementary and fragmented. I have no connections with anyone mentioned in the novel, including the author. Overall, it was a disappointing read. Shocking and heart wrenching, but a far cry from literature."
5,Best book I've read this year!,"A fascinating book, I could not put it down. Haunting yet upbeat at the same time......a real gem!"
4,great book,This book was great. It offered an insight to how some poor people lived and why they lived the was they did. It also showed how if you are determind to make something of yourself there are plenty of ways to do so.
3,"Loved it, but found it hard to believe","You know I really loved this book, but I struggled to believe all of it. I would have to say, however, even if it isn't all true the author is an excellent writer and the story is thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Truth?,"I have a great deal of difficulty in trusting the veracity of this book especially since some of her 'memories' are of age 3. A 3 year old shooting a pistol at cans with her father teaching her???? Please!!! All the details, the book is so preposterous that I keep reading to see how much more unbelievable it can be. How could she possibly remember all the stuff she says happened??? I refuse to believe anyone could live this way. I consider it a work of fiction, not a memoir. It is just too, too fantastic to think that parents can actually be like this. If they are, then god bless my parents! They were sterling!I can't believe all the high marks given by other reviewers. Is this reality or one of those 'reality' shows?"
5,Fabulous Insight into Another World,"Jeannette Walls writes a captivating memoir about her and her siblings struggles growing up in the less than ideal world of poverty, hunger, and alcoholism. Her descriptions are raw and vulnerable. I could nearly feel the pain and frustration she must have felt. At the same time, her family's patience in dealing with their own family ""demons"" helped to inspire me to do the same in my own life. This book will catch you from the very first page. A definite must read!"
3,ok,i could never finish it. the story was too close to experiences in my life. great book thug. just personally could not finish it.
5,Wow,"I live in Bluefield WV and this book made me realize why so many people think West Virginia is hick-ville. This is a sad, trauma-inducing, wonderful book. I would recommend this to anyone."
4,Good read,This book was an easy read and enjoyable; no purple prose or ramble. The author writes very well. You can tell that she was a good journalist.
5,This one will stick with you..,"This book moved me in ways I cannot describe. The author is a shining example of ""if you put your mind to it..."" I was at times angry and at times inspired during my reading of this book. Just when you thought the author and her siblings would have stability, her parents took it away and chose to live a life that put their children in danger time after time.No food, no working plumbing, a home collapsing around them. It's no wonder these kids made it to adulthood.If anyone doubts the level of truth in this book, please note that the author's teachers and others in her life have verified her accounts. Perhaps this kind of poverty and loathsome parenting are hard to imagine...but if you care to see the darker side of America, this is it.Thank you Ms. Walls for helping me realize I just don't have it that bad."
5,Wonderful Book,"Absolutely wonderful story of a crazy family and their trials and dynamics. This book will make you cringe and laugh, all while you can't wait to find out what happens next. It is a well written, poignant, intensely personal, and engaging true story that everyone should read."
3,Probably won't read it again.,"I had to read this book for a college class, and in all honesty, it's not a book I would've read on my own.Walls' recollection of her childhood is amazing, although I imagine she had to confer with her siblings to verify dates and other information.While there were incidents involving her father that infuriated me, I had a hard time condemning her mother, who struck me as having an undiagnosed mental illness and/or disability. Through it all, however, I never doubted that her parents loved her and her siblings.The reason I gave this book three stars was I felt that Walls' story telling was rather dry. I don't feel that she painted the people in her life as being three dimensional. To me, they were just characters in a book, not flesh and blood.On the positive side, it opened up some interesting discussions in my class about the definition of homelessness and the intricacies of parenting."
4,A story of resilience,"I found The Glass Castle really hard to believe sometimes; not because I didn't believe the authors' account, but imagining how terrible some of the family's hard times were - especially on the children.The brilliance and eccentricity of the parents is just hard to comprehend sometimes - denying their children basic life essentials (food, water, heat) for some very illogical reasons. But, that's what makes the memoir so powerful.The Glass Castle is really well written and I'm really glad most of the children thrived despite their difficult childhood circumstances."
1,"Really a ""Memoir?""","This is a required reading for our bookclub. Frankly, it just didn't do it for me. I question the authenticity of all the ""memories"" the author puts into her book.While I don't doubt she had a difficult and emotionally abusive childhood, she certainly takes literary liberties in calling this a memoir. Perhaps ""historical fiction"" would better serve the reader as to its purpose.Not great, not even inspiring."
1,I thought the book was very boring,"Although the book was well written,I found the subject matter boring. I kept waiting for somethging exciting to happen. I think this book would be more interesting to women."
2,Foul,The easy read and quick humor sucked me in. But the extremely foul language and immoral scenes painted in my mind pulled me out. I could not finish the book.
5,"A Beautiful, Poignant Memoir","This memoir was entertaining and educational at the same time - no easy feat. It can be laugh-out-loud funny (though the event might not have been funny at the time) and gut-wrenchingly sad on the next page. The author doesn't want pity and doesn't seem to feel sorry for herself, but at the same time, she's realistic about how her upbringing affected her - an important journey for nearly all adults. I highly recommend this book!"
3,The Glass Castle,"The horrors of her childhood were completely believable to me. The child learned early that her wants and needs were less important than anyone else's, even a randy drunk's. The excuse that she was made stronger by these attacks on her innocence is not new.What I object to is the copout Martha Stewart Living ending. What happened to Walls's insight that those beautiful people's outsides harbored faults and problems on the inside? Perhaps Walls is, understandably, painting a perfect exterior to calm her interior demons."
3,Easy read,"So, I read this book very quickly, with the help of short chapters and constant turmoil for these poor children. Although I found the book very good I cant help but think some is possibly fabricated. The author Jeanette is partially molested several times and nothing is done by the parents except finding excuses to disprove the daughter. Also, I find it hard to believe that no one ever stepped in to help these poor children in there very apparent neglect at home. Not to discount if all is true the author remembers more detail of her childhood than I ever will. I would still recommend this book to a friend for a mouth dropping read."
4,Dysfunctionally Disturbingly Delicious!,"The Glass Castle was recommended to me by one of my friends that ALWAYS gives the best suggestions. Once again, my friend came through. The Glass Castle is a memoir about one disturbing family! Did anyone else seriously want to shake some sense in to Jeanette's parents? You will connect with the Walls' children and want protect them from their dysfunctional parents.I have since recommended The Glass Castle to several friends of varying ages and all have enjoyed. If you are in a book club, I think this book would be an interesting club read. You definitely should pick up The Glass Castle - you won't want to put it down!"
4,Thought provoking - hard to believe but it's true,I was astounded by the life of the Wall family and what the children went through and more importantly how they perceived their family and their life. The level of seemingly unnecessary poverty was unnerving at best.Well written book. I recommend it highly.
3,Good but......,"I know for a FACT that the portions regarding turquoise are false. I am well acquainted with turquoise. When it comes from the ground it looks like white chalk. It goes through a months long process, in many chemical baths, to become what we know it is. SO... even though this is a small portion of the book I couldn't help but wonder throughout the rest of it where the other falsehoods were."
3,Reminds me of growing up with my dear old Mom,"Somehow childern in abusive situations seem to maintain their sense of humor, despite what is happening around them and to them.An incredible memoir of 4 brave kids and their highly unique parents.I skimmed thru the book to get an idea of what I'd be reading, and was astounded by the abuse, as well as the bravery. However, once I started reading from page one, and I came to the part where Rex brutally killed their pets, I closed the book and returned it to the library. Enough."
1,"I'm surprised more reviewers weren't reminded of ""A Million Little Pieces.""",I see I'm not the only one who quickly questioned the accuracy/veracity of a child's encyclopedic memory. I hate being flim-flammed by such stories (especially since my family had its own Rex Walls) and would give the book no stars if I could.
5,Great Book - Arrived as promised,"The book, The Glass Castle, was a fantastic read. It is amazing what a child who faced so many challenges could become an adult with such a positive reflection on life and the ability to make due with the cards she was dealt."
4,Fascinating,"Glass Castle is a fascinating memoir of a young girl's difficult childhood. Written from a non-victim perspective, it demonstrates the amazing human spirit in the most difficult of circumstances. I highly recommend this book."
1,Minority Report,"I seem to be in the minority here, but I could not finish this ""memoir."" After the third (or possibly the fourth) ""accidental"" burning of a child, I had to tell myself that I needed to stop reading about this incredibly dysfunctional family. I had nothing to learn from them, except that somewhere, somehow, some authorities should have intervened to prevent this from happening (if it really did). If they stayed that far ""under the radar"" it is a sad commentary. I also read an interview with the author where she continues to excuse her parents' behavior -- sorry, that just won't work. These people are no role models, nor are they funny or even tragic! I love a good novel, a murder mystery, everything from Shakespearean tragedy to low comedy, but this did not show me anything from which to learn or laugh. I can only ask why so many people condone these parents' behaviors."
4,Resiliancy,It really is true that some things aren't as awful as they seem when we take into account the lessons learned from them. Even though Rex was a drunk there were plenty of good things he taught his children and he made an effort to be involved. The mother was emotionally absent and I found her to be more neglectful because of that. I compare this book to Running With Scissors but I enjoyed The Glass Castle much more partly because Jeannette Walls didn't try to make her circumstances humorous or absurd. Walls does a good job of recapturing her life's events through the mind of a child; she doesn't taint the story with the harsh judgement of an adult except for those times in the story when she was one. This was a sweet and quick read.
5,Good Reading,"The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls was a well-written personal memoirs story. It was just that...a story, which made it easy to read. Ms. Walls made her family come to life for me. It was a real story of survival in the USA, during some very lean times."
4,Great Memoir,"I thought this book was an excellent recall of an unbelievable life. I thought about (and still am) this book long after I read the last page. It is quite a testament to the resilience of children, and to how many little heroes we have running around in our midst. The author, and her sibling's, bravery to survive is stunning. A quick read, I couldn't put it down."
5,Captivating,What a wonderful book... I had mixed emotions with the parents. One thing that angered me was in the incident in the Zoo and the Mother's response to Jeanette when her uncle was acting weird with her. Also it saddened me that the parents never took the responsibility to give them food :(Such an awesome book!
5,Wonderful,This is the best book I've read in a long time. I suggest everyone read it at least once. Awesome
5,A Brilliant and Poignant Memoir of an Off-the Grid Dysfunctional Family,"Wow! There are over 1,200 reviews for this book. That's a great thing because this book should be read.This is a brilliant and poignant memoir of a family that lives hand-to-mouth. They are beyond eccentricity and quirkiness, virtually off the grid. One might even refer to them as outcasts or 'pariah poor'.How the author navigates her life, goes to college and makes her own family is an homage to resilience and denial."
1,"overrated book, it is not a novel and not a memoir","Poorly designed, narrated and definitely hard to believe. The most unbelievable part is her account with detailed conversation when she was 3 years old!!! a 3 year old remembers such detailed conversation... very far fetched.I was very disappointed with this book, it has no message, no focus, i felt numb after reading it"
4,Easier read than expected,"This was a book club pick and I was a little worried. But after starting it, I found it quite enjoyable. We had quite a bit of discussion comparing this book to Angela's Ashes, with most of our club thinking that was a much better book. A couple of us though really appreciated the way this book didn't try to over emotionalize everything, so you could see the lighter side of even the worst things going on. I guess, if you really liked Angela's Ashes, you probably won't like this as much, but if you thought Angela's Ashes was a complete drag (like I did) you will probably find this a great deal more enjoyable."
2,The Glass Castle,"Fair condition, but it took a long time to have it shipped. I had hoped to take it on a trip and it arrived much slower than it should have."
2,Not the kind of book you read for fun,"This book was sent by a great seller however, it is not an uplifting read. I can usually handle sad books but this book is just horribly frustrating from start to finish. Maybe this is what the author hoped to achieve and if so, she succeeded. However, I don't read in my free time with hopes that the books will depress me."
5,Clear-eyed and jarring,"Jeannette Walls has written a work of incredible power. Her ability to illustrate the incredible trials and demands of her childhood with a sense of control and even detachment is nothing short of astonishing. There is an edge to this writing that is very similar to intimate journalism and reads like the most perceptive of news stories. She manages to draw you into her life story without any level of self-pity or pandering, which any reader would forgive her for. The fact that she avoids such pitfalls is what makes this book such a fantastic read.Disturbing and utterly absorbing at once."
5,Glad I read it,"I first started reading this book at the counter of a burger bar. This woman walks by me, sees what I'm reading as says, ""that is a REALLY good book. You're going to love it."" It made be feel weird because this woman has no idea who I am or what types of books I read and yet, she was SURE that I would enjoy it. Well, she was right. I absolutely loved this book. This is a truly haunting story. I don't often say this but I literally could not put it down. It got to the point where I stayed up until 6 AM one morning just to finish!The recollection of a fantasy world that their parents created around them masked the children from a life of apparent poverty, constant relocation, hunger, and often abuse. It's pretty engaging to see how the children develop over time and how the story develops as well.Glad I read it. Hope to read it again."
5,This is a must Read!,"Jeannette Walls transports you into the steaming kitchen of her childhood within the first few pages and there's no leaving her side for the entire book. A true story of overcoming the odds, her memoir is more vivid than most any fictional accounts of surviving a seriously messed up home life. Just when you think nothing else can happen another twist leaves the reader stunned in disbelief.Most refreshing is the absence of self pity Jeannette Walls has for herself. Her pick-up your bootstraps attitude will inspire and awe all who read this novel. One of my new favorites!"
2,Unbelievable,"I had to read this book for a book club and couldn't be more disappointed. I don't know who I can't stand more; the mother, father or Jeannette. I saw her on The View and she was hard to believe there also."
3,Interesting read,It had me questioning if this was real or fiction at times. Very unorthodox family to say the least. Wow.
5,The Glass Castle,"Jeannette Walls was born into a very unusual family. Gypsy like, the family moves from town to town, leaving when financial or legal troubles catches up with them. Her father, the town drunk, works odd jobs as he dreams up a number of impossible inventions. Her mother, an artist, is unwilling, or perhaps unable, to care for her four children. Despite their poverty and lack of food, the children band together in order to survive. An intriguing tale of survival, the memoire is well written and engaging. It is an interesting portrait of an unusual life, one well worth reading."
3,Somewhat unbelievable,"As I read this memoir, I couldn't help but wonder if the stories and incidents were true. I'm over 40 and don't have many memories of being age 3, age 4, or age 5; whereas, Jeanette has clear and vivid memories of her early childhood. This is a story filled with terrible family dysfunction. While reading it I laughed and cried, was angry and felt pity. I rated it a three only because I thought it was a bit unbelievable, but the story was good and held my interest throughout."
3,Far Fetched.,"An interesting read. However, I would not consider this a page turner. Some of the stories seem hard to believe... such as cooking hotdogs at 3 years old? Take it with a grain of salt and you will most likely enjoy this book. I would like to slap her lazy mom though. Hard."
5,A great read,"This book will horrify you, amaze you, and inspire you. Jeannette Walls tells her story without an ounce of self-pity or judgement. I find most memoirs to be boring, written by egomaniacs. This is not like that at all! The Glass Castle is fascinating! Highly recommended!"
2,Glass Castle Review,"While I found the children of the Wells family to be sympathetic characters and I applaud their perserverance to achieve against all odds, I also found the book tedious reading in spots.I feel that it was written more as a catharsis for the author rather than entertainment for the reader. However, I do admire her loyalty to parents who deserved none."
