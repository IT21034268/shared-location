1,Muy poca informacion,"La informacion no fue suficiete. La informacion devio de ser mas detallada, definitivamenta comprar este libro fue una perdida por la mayor parte. Este libro pudiese ser excellente si tubiese mas contenido. Definitivamentte no lo recomiendo."
2,Que desilusion,este libro al principi parece bueno pero al analizar las recetas y hechizos que ofrece muy pocas son efectivas (como3 o 4 ) pero lo demas es un fiasco le doy 2 estrellas porque por lo menos tiene una lectura algo interesante y esperanzadora pero nada mas.
1,No lo recomiendo,Este librito no explica con detalles como hacer las magias. Es muy breve y pobre en su contenido. Muy poco creible. Pareciera que la autora lo escribio a toda carrera. Pienso que el lector merece mas informacion y respeto por el dinero que paga cuando compra algun libro. Gracias.
4,better for people than parrots...,"This cd is beautiful and relaxing...Unfortunately, my parrot who it was for, really hates it. He seems to just dislike all piano.However, my family and I all thought it was lovely, and I would recommend it for relaxation, meditation, etc.Hope this helps!"
3,Cute flip-flops,"I think they are adorable, but they hurt in between my toes and lack cushion/support. That's typical of flip-flops, but there are more cushiony options (Reefs, Crocs)."
4,Price listed must be incorrect,"As the previous reviewer said, the price on this item is outrageous! The only thing that I can think of is that it must be a typo. I just purchased this exact same item at Target and paid $7.99 (on sale). Regular price is $9.99. It is very cute, but I wouldn't pay $44.00."
3,$$$$$$,"Way overpriced! Child loves it, however, paying parent is Very disapointed in value versus price paid."
4,Very good book presenting subject matter in a logical manner,Book is easy to read through in 2 days or less. Gives good information especially if this is your first computer assembly book. Not overly technical but sticks to essential assembly procedures. Book should probably be priced less than $15. Book is not a debugging manual for problems with WIN95/98 installation.
5,James Fenimore Cooper: The Leatherstocking Tales II,"Excellent, high-quality binding, paper and typeface make this volume a joy to handle and read. The classic Leatherstocking Tales have never looked better. The time line and notes help place the readings in historical perspective."
2,Brief and Wordy in the Wrong Places,"Long on example narratives that are nice as inspiration pieces, but little more. The excellent aspects are the portions where it asks the reader to complete a task, but the instructions and the examples for how to accomplish the task do very little to guide you toward completing the tasks. YOu can figure them out on your own and still reach your goal, but what is the book for at that point? That being the case it could be a 80 page wonder rather than an ""Chicken Soup for the Leader"" type anchor in your bag or briefcase."
2,nice little book NOT SPANISH,Is their a publishing code in England that SAYS Spanish Edition but MEANS printed in a Spanish factory? This is the third and last Brittish book I buy that says Spanish Edition. It's misleading!
1,Boring,I really tried to finish this book but quit about 3/4 of the way through. I felt it dragged and seemed like something I may have enjoyed when I was a young girl.
2,Just ok,"The image quality is not the best, and the movie is 4:3. it does say so in the details, and it's my fault that i assumed that the widescreen cover photo meant something. but i feel i should alert others to avoid my mistake. it's a great concept, but for me on these things, image quality is everything, and this one is less than 100% sharp, and scenicic beauty in 4:3 feels really cramped."
4,Super time saver,"I am a professional carpenter in California, where extensive use of metal framing connectors is standard practice in both commercial and residential construction. This nailer proved to be worth it's cost purely in time savings. When the cost (to a customer) for a carpenter is roughly $70/hour, time IS money. The nail gun drives one nail only when the nail tip is placed in a hole in a connector, making for accurate framing. The reliability of Hitachi tools is well known, so don't worry about that. The only drawbacks are that it will not fire all nails in the nail strip (jamming reducer), and that it doesn't always drive nails full depth into engineered lumber (heavy beams), although this is more likely a function of the compressor."
3,Not Happy,"Hitachi used to make great tools. Sadly, I find they are going down hill across the board, which is really disappointing.When this worked for me, it was great, as per the other reviews. But it started malfunctioning, and the seals died, after about 2 years of light use. First gun I've had this happen with - on the other hand my Hitachi framing nailer (probably the best one ever built) has lasted through a decade with no problem.I'm not sure if my problem was a one off. I'm sure it is something that never would have happened to Hitachi in the past, and meets with the talk out there that hitachi is going down hill. sad."
4,Very Infomative,John Annerino gives his readers an abundance of information about the trails and geology of the Grand Canyon. My husband and I especially like the compact size of the book - great for tossing in a daypack while hiking the canyon.
2,Not durable; bearings going after just one year,Not durable; bearings going after just one year. Did work pretty well making smoothies though.
2,Better Off with regular baby book,"Sounds better than it is. I was excited about my first child and went on a buying spree. This one is kinda a dud. Sounds nice, great ideas, but poorly designed. I could do better with a word processing program!"
1,junk,"dont buy carter elec fuel pumps from napa, have had nothing but trouble from them,had to replace the last one one month and four days after it was installed,the one before that lasted about one year, the one before that did'nt work at all,been through four in less than two years.this fuel pump is for an 86 ford f150, napa replaced the last one, but you have to pay the labor no matter what, I'm not the only one I know having this problem, napa knows this product is junk and I'm sure carter does too, what ever happend to quality. I've had it with this product, dont want no more carter pumps or napas parts that they buy cheap and then charge top doller for. I'm tired of being ripped by these people.."
5,Fuel Pump,I installed this fuel pump on a John Deere Graden Tractor to make sure of a constant fuel flow to engine. I did not remove the orignal fulel bump that is Vacumm ran and the new pump feeds fuel to engine and doese not over load the old pump. Everything works as should.
5,Tire gauge review,"My husband complained that the pencil style tire gauges were inconsistent at reading tire pressure. For his birthday, I researched tire gauges. This gauge consistently was rated highly as being accurate and easy to use. The only other gauges rated as well were digital read outs. My husband prefers mechanical measuring devices. He has used it quite a lot and finds it to provide consistent readings. We are both very pleased with this product."
5,Very Accurate!!!,"It's simple! No high tech digital crap to deal with or hard to find batteries none the less. AutoMeter is also a well known name when it comes to any type of automotive guages.Very study, heavy feel, but not sure how well it will stand up if dropped.I'm sure this guage is very accurate as well."
4,Jeopardy-style facts.....lots of them!,"This book was recommended to me by my dad. Reader's Digest needs no introduction as a company, and this book further establishes its credo. The book is full of useful tidbits of information and is ideal for reading as a pastime. Its only demerit is that the information is slightly dated (to the mid-90s)."
1,Did this author actually watch any of the trial?,"All I can say is: ""the leaves were hinting at their autumnal intent."" Yes, this line is actually in this book."
1,No warranty - low quality product,"This product is of a low quality, the metal insert will pierce the fabric after a month of use.There is no warranty to the product."
3,Some shapes a little tough to use,"This product was great, except that they were so small that some of the cutters (the numbers in particular) were hard to use. They would be great if you're just using them for 1 or 2 of each number, but if you're looking to do numerous of one number, it could be very time consuming. I was wanting to do a whole bunch of 4's for a birthday party, and it didn't work out for that. But I was able to use the K and do a bunch of those, so overall, they were good."
3,"Huge bottles, expensive accessories","I originally got the bottles because they were one of the few brands that were BPA-free at the time. They also hold 9 ounces - the only brand I've found to hold that much. However, be warned that the nipples are expensive and cost $7 for a pack of two. And be careful when buying the three-pack box because they may not come with three ventilating systems. I had to buy an additional two vents for another $7. And my son has a hard time getting his lips around the wider nipple base, but he doesn't complain and still gets fed. While I like the size of the bottle, and I like that the nipples come in different sizes depending on age. But I'm not happy about paying so much for nipples and other accessories."
1,Vent system is faulty,"I've had these bottles for 6 months and they work OK except for one major flaw. The vent system doesn't work well. To get air to flow into the bottle, you frequently have to loosen the cap and this can lead to a messy leak. Dr Brown makes bottles that are BPA free, cost much less, and don't have venting issues."
4,Good bottles,I started out with the dr. Browns bottles but they leaked so much they were such a hassle. These leak once in a great while and are easy to clean.
1,melts when sterilized,"I sterilized these in the Medela bags as I have sterilized other bottles and they melted together! To add insult to injury when I returned the bottles to Born Free with my receipt and address, I have to date never received a response. I'm glad to see there are other pba free bottles for more choice."
3,Not Great...,"We didn't have spills, nor colic, and you do get used to cleaning all the little parts... but I have to say that in retrospect that these bottles were pretty underwhelming. We switched recently to the plain old Gerbers now that he's past the colic stage, and he's drinking faster with less post bottle throw up. We had wondered why he was so slow compared to the first kid (who was on Avent) but now we know. Hopefully Avent figures out the BPA free leaking thing for new parents."
4,Bottles are fine once you get used to all the parts,"We bought the Born Free bottles because they were the only wide nipple, BPA FREE bottles available at the time. Our son ajusted well to the new nipples (he had been using Avent nipples for about 8 months). In fact, he seemed to like them better. The bottle itself isn't too bad if you are just putting breast milk in it, but you have to be careful if you are mixing formula in the bottle. There is a slit in the air vent that gets blocked every so often even when you mix the formula side to side. Once the vent is blocked no air is allowed in the bottle and it interupts drinking which is very annoying--especially when you are trying to get your baby to sleep!"
5,Great bpa-free bottles!,"I am so glad that I ordered these bottles. I used Dr. Brown's with my first daughter, but after my second daughter was born I heard about the concerns regarding bisphenol-A in baby bottles. Whether or not these chemicals prove to be harmful is beside the point. Now that I know there is a CHANCE that these chemicals can leach into baby formula, I am not willing to take the risk. I got rid of all my other bottles, and now I am only using Born Free. The parts are very easy to take apart and clean, and the nipple is actually very similar to the nipple that is used with the wide-mouth Dr. Brown's bottle, so my daughter does fine with it. I highly recommend using these bottles - if nothing else, than for peace of mind!"
3,Sucky Nipples,I like that the bottles are BPA Free - I feel good about using them to feed my baby. But I don't like dealing with the extra vent parts - it's just more parts to wash. I tried using the bottles without putting the vent in and the nipples just collapse - so you have to use the vents. But overall I like these bottles.
5,LOVE these bottles!,"I originally purchased these bottles purely because they are BPA free, but they have so much more to offer. I had been using Dr. Brown's wide-neck bottles in the past and I was a bit skeptical when I decided to switch to a BPA free bottle; was I surprised! I have not had any problems with leaks and the anti-colic system is working great for my three month old who has had HORRIBLE colic in the past. They are also easy to hold and it doesn't take but a second to assemble (even when I have to make a bottle one handed!) I highly recommend these to anyone."
3,Expensive and Leaky,We have been using the born free bottles for 8 months and are annoyed that we have lost 3 bottle to leaking. The bottles have developed fine cracks in them that leak insidiously. These bottles have only been hand washed and barely/rarely dropped (baby doesn't hold her own bottle yet). For the price I'd expect something more sturdy. Truly appreciate the BPA free offering but could have gotten that in the mdedela's I had w/the pump.
5,The BEST Bottles out there!,"When our 2nd baby was born in 2008, there was a big movement towards BPA free bottles and I jumped on the bandwagon and went with these Born Free bottles as many moms recommended them to me. We had used Avent with our 1st and these looked very similar.Well they turned out to be not just good but FANTASTIC! They NEVER leak and the nipple is big and wide that it did not create confusion when transitioning from breast to bottle.Yes, there are more parts to clean than the regular bottle and they are one of the most expensive bottle out there but they are worth EVERY PENNY!When our 3rd baby was born, 5 months ago, I bought some Avent BPA Free bottles to try and they were a leaky mess. My husband even said he wanted to go back to the Born Free.I recommend these to anyone and everyone who wants an awesome bottle that will last a long time, is safe and doesn't leak."
5,"Switched from Avent due to BPA concerns, VERY HAPPY","We switched our 11 month old daughter to these bottles just this past week after all of the BPA stuff was publicized. She was on Avent bottles, which worked well, but we tossed them. These bottles actually work better than the Avent bottles. My daughter absolutely drains these things when she drinks from them. They seem to flow really smoothly and she isn't working too hard to get the milk. Great product so far, very happy."
3,a few things,"The mounting screws for this are very soft. I stripped them out. Replace with your own lag bolts.Installation time consuming, had to use a wrench instead of ratchet and socket due to proximity of lamp housing.It works as described. Nice warm yellowish glow."
5,lights up the night!,"a lot of light. Comes on at dusk, goes off at dawn I don't have to remember to cut it on!"
3,Sing Me a Mystery,"We love the Mystery Woman series, but this particular episode was not one of our favorites."
2,Sanding problems that I am encountering,"I spent about $400, for this tool, along with the contour attachmentsand a few other attachments and a good supply of sanding pads.I have only used it for less than an hour...and the Velcro hooks have worn off a good portion of the triangle head.At least on my cheap Ryobi pad sander, it was just the whole Velcro pad itself that was coming looseand I was able to firmly re-attach it with some 5200.I am stunned that I will have to replace the Fein attachment after such little use.I'm also having problems with the contour sander.It is eating right through the sandpaper, in about 2 minutes.I tried making sturdier sandpaper refills, by cutting some from belts made for my belt sander...but they still self-destruct with the concave tip I was trying to use. I had to sand by hand instead.I am working with Cumaru, which is brutal...but I don't think that should render the tool useless like this?The Fein Multimaster is 0 for 2 so far.I'm very disappointed."
4,Great Ideas,"Read the book cover to cover and enjoyed a fresh look at residential design. As an architect myself, it made me rethink some of my own design processes. Bigger isn't always necessarily better!"
3,Good player. Tough finding DC Adapter,"The player souded good and works fine, but trying to find the AY 3170 4.5V DC adapter has prooved to be very difficult, and it seems to eat up batteries pretty quick when I use it at work."
3,Olay in Shower Lotion - It's just okay,"After reading all the wonderful reviews, I just had to try it for myself. I understand they are not manufacturing this particular version anymore. Anyhow, I was not that impressed. The smell was so-so and I thought it left my skin feeling a little greasy. My daughter also tried it and felt the same way about it. I won't buy it again."
5,The BEST!,"I LOVE this product. I am in the water everyday and my skin gets so dried out (especially in the winter) but you could never tell since I started using it. My mother alwasys uses baby oil in the shower but I find it too oily and it leaves this residue but the Olay In Shower lotion is amazing. I use less body lotion and the scent is wonderful( my husband loves it too)! I also love the golden speckles you can see when the light hits my skin (it's just soft enough to glow without being overly sparkly and the quench and shea in shower ones don't have the sparkle so the anti aging is my favorite). I use about three a month so I like to buy lots and I always try to stock up on my favorite items because you never know when they might be discontinued(hopefully never, because I will use this 'til the day I die)!"
3,Album's aight,"The tracks are mad gritty. A lot of cats from the Brooklyn underground are up in here. The tracks are sort of mediocre though, the artists that appear here have much more in them."
4,"Eat Your Heart Out, Nancy Drew!!","Madison Malone is a heroine readers can relate to because her life isn't in perfect order and she's taking steps to make some much needed changes as this enjoyable book begins. Moving from Ohio to Virginia, she's confronted with the usual challenges of learning her way around, adjusting to a new job, and making new friends. However, Madison is faced with a darker challenge when one of these new friends is found dead in the lake near her home. Her fresh start appears to be in jeopardy as the police focus their attention on Madison as a possible suspect. In her typical determined style though, she doesn't allow this tragedy to derail her for long as she sets out to find some answers. Fortunately, she has the friendship of her handsome new neighbor, Navy Commander Tyler Collins, in her quest. It's fun to watch Madison navigate her way through this crisis and regain some control in her life by having the courgage to pursue a long held dream."
3,Believe In The Power Of Invisibility,"When you watch this film, take it for what it is worth and realize that at the time of its production a lot of campy pictures were made and some much worse than this. You have to be a big admirer of Ben Murphy's (and I am) and a child of a certain era to appreciate a government agent with the power to disappear who looks like he would be equally at home on the cover of G.Q. The friendship ol' ""Buffalo"" and ""Lazy Rider""(Ben Murphy) develop is fun to watch. When Buffalo is about to save Lazy Rider as his truck is a runaway, he informes Lazy Rider that he is carrying a cargo of eggs. Lazy Rider, approaching Buffalo's back door at 67 miles an hour and about ready to make contact says, ""I sure hope you like 'em scrambled."" Ben Murphy sure knows how to deliver a line!"
1,A Director's NIGHTMARE!!!,"This flick was so CHEESY and BADLY DONE that it has surfaced in my favorite Sci-fi channel show, Mystery Science Thteater 3000; poor Mike Nelson, Tom Serbo and Crow had to endure this turkey of a movie. I laughed my butt off!!!! THAT'S the copy I wish to purchase--the MST3K brand lollololol"
1,pretty but ugh,"it looks nice ,however it is flimsy. The seat and back feel like sitting on a hard cardboard surface. Needs to be more padded in order to be comfortable. Very disappointing. Not worth the money. Thumbs down"
3,Does it come with canopy???,I am planning to buy this item but nowhere it says whether it's coming with canopy or not..please let me know!Thanks!Bozena
4,"Good purchase, poor directions","The swing looks great and it holds two adults very comfortably. The directions for assembly were awful and things were mislabelled which made us scramble to find replacements for missing pieces. At the end of it all, it was a good buy- for the price!"
5,"Great, rarely heard side of Paul Desmond","I have long been a fan of Paul Desmond through his work with Dave Brubeck but I only recently discovered this 1961 recording. If you think you know Desmond but do not know this recording, think again - and buy this CD. More laid back and relaxing than Desmond's Brubeck work, this recording has become my soundtrack for relaxing evenings or long drives in the car. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
5,grab grab.. grab-grab...grab... grab yo stuff! AWESOME,"I love the soundtrack so much, I had to make my own off of the video (pretty bad sounding, on a non Hi-Fi CD)...Some guy on ebay wants $100 for it!!!! This is a must have... PLEASE REISSUE THE DAMN CD!"
4,"Bouncing arrows, but still good","I think this is one of the best-ever medieval war films. Charlton Heston's role (Chrysagon Delacroix) is almost perfect: Rosemary Forsyth (Bronwyn) is mysterious and gorgeous. Bors (played by Richard Boone) is taciturn, rough and also unforgettable. Draco (Guy Stockwell, Heston's insanely jealous younger brother) is my favorite character.Other than a few visual (technical) gaffs - like arrows bouncing off the siege tower draw bridge, and using modern-looking recurve bows - the armor and weapons and fighting is very satisfying. The mixture of Christianity in the presence of the old unforgotten Celtic religion is a tense ingredient that adds depth to what is essentially a simple story of ""boy meets girl"" and keeps her, even when his world turns against him over it."
5,Heston rules England,A wonder film taking you back to the middle ages. Heston plays a knight given a shire to watch over and while he is a good protector his evil brother seeks to take the land for himself. This a great movie for the entire family to view. differently a winner in my book
1,Broken in two months,"Worked great for about two months, then it stopped working completely-it would just not turn on. Very disappointed in this product."
5,Perfect for your OTR truck driver,My son started driving a truck about a year ago and didn't want a microwave in the truck because he didn't have a place to store it. This little unit is perfect for warming up food while he is driving.
4,Cooking in Your car,"I bought this stove for my son who is a over-the-road truck driver. He is amazed. He used to take left over meals that we would freeze for him and then nuke them when he got ready to eat. But depending on the weather imagine running back to your truck with a red hot tupperware in your hands, in the rain or snow isn't easy Think about it. Now he still takes the meals and in the comfort of his truck puts them in his stove and in minutes hot food, no running. Also no clean up cuz you put in a 3' by 8' foil pan in the stove and cook it up then throw it out. Cool huh? Anyway its a good product and he loves it. We give ita thumbs up LOL"
4,Bought this for a trucker,"I bought this for my dad, who is a trucker. He gets a lot of use out of it, heating up meals from home, and likes it because it allows him to save money and eat healthier on the road (as well as saving time because he doesn't have to stop as often)."
5,I like it alot!,"First do NOT order those overpriced liners. Go to Kroger or Ralphs and get 1 lb loaf pans 3 for Dollar! ANd then you always have a clean oven. That is really what this is. It is not a stove, it is an oven, not like a cheezy microwave that rubbers everything up. An oven that heats thoughly and evenly and even crisps thangs up around the edges which you wont get from a microwave. I like it alot! And the reviewer who said what they got was different then what is pictured, m ine looks pretty much like the picture. to the reviewer who said he got two DOA's I says is your cigarrette lighter a workin???"
1,Zero stars wasn't an option...,"This thing is junk. I plugged it in, installed drivers, and it looked like it was going to work till I plugged in a USB device. I tried cards, drives, and printers. Cards worked for a couple of minutes then complete PC lockup and no hope of coming home... Junk. It's not worth the postage to send back so in the trash and another lesson learned."
1,Died after five days,"Worked fine for about five days, and then one day the computer didn't recognize the card anymore. Tried plugging my USB peripherals into other hubs/ports and they worked just fine, so it wasn't the peripherals having the problem; tried switching the card to a different PCI slot and it still didn't work; tried using a different PCI-to-USB card and that worked just fine. Therefore, this card was the problem."
1,"I got one labeled as 2gb, but only 128mb inside","I bought one from Fry's Electronics in San Francisco Bay area. Outside it is labeled as 2GB, it is only read as 128 MB. My casio camera can't read this card. Don't recommend this brand."
2,Basically Improper,"If you have had little or no exposure to North American culture or media, this book would provide you with all of the fundamentals of the upper class. Beyond that, Lisa Johnson's advice seems largely based upon common sense or on how to not be lower class. Very little useful specific information is given. I also disliked the author's approach to meeting people. In the unlikely event that one does see a millionaire in the 7-11, it's just not the sort of place that one socializes and properly meets people. Yet that's just the sort of thing that is suggested by the author. The general lack of propriety in her methods is what makes this book poor instruction unless you really need the basics. Try Ginie Polo Sayles's book for something a bit more useful."
3,Informative book,"This book was pretty good but I would not read it twice lol. Common sense goes along way, but there are some new things in here that I never thought about."
1,Don't Bother- The Rules are Better,"This book is drivel. The author teaches you to approach men, chase after them, research their lives and backrounds, etc. I thought it would be an interesting book, but she actually fills the pages with advice like: give hints to let him know you'd marry him if asked, men don't like white shoes after labor day, and she even has recipes and word lists! The fact that she herself has not managed to snare a millionaire and her mother is divorced because her own father was cheating tells you just how effective her advice is in getting a rich husband and happy marriage. If you must read it, get it at the library, but don't pay for it. I wish I hadn't."
5,good lighting,"Circular light is excellent lighting which is not too bright or not too dim and no glare, but I prefer daylight instead of warm soft white because it is very hard to find on the market. It is soft white and better than nothing. I prefer circular light much better lighting than any fluorescent light bulbs because fluorescent light bulbs are too bright and glare and hotter."
5,Brilliant and haunting,"""The Country Life"" is one of very few contemporary books that has really captured my imagination, and, I hesitate to say it for fear of sounding corny, my heart. Something about this very awkward and self-conscious narrator will resonate with anyone who has been a dork growing up, and the central relationship rings true, if for all the wrong reasons. I wanted to reread it almost as soon as I finished it--I felt there was some kind of treasure there that I wanted to find again. Not for everyone, but if this books works for you, it will make your day."
3,Not enough Misty,"Swedish Wildcats makes up the majority of this two feature DVD. A 70's grindhouse sexploitation film is laughably, unintentionally funny now. Attractive girls with natural [...].New York Wildcats is inspired by the opening sequence of the original, complete with interesting body paint. It is short, too short. And not enough Misty. What Misty it does have is Misty as Precious, the world famous Peacock. Suitable only for a die hard Misty fan. You can do better with almost any of her other movies, except maybe Bite Me."
1,Another dead blog,On the first day of the trial I got an article dated 8/26/08. This blog hasn't been updated in almost 2 years.
3,Dawn Dawn Dawn,"How did Dawn change her mind so fast? In California girls, at the end she learned to like carol and said she wouludn't mind if she married her dad, but in this book, she had a problem with it and she booked her own flight back to connecticut. That was very sneaky of her and it does sound like something rebellious a teengar would do for sure. In fact, I liked that part the best even though I don't agree with what she did. I didn't care for the rest of the book."
1,Response to Author,"I was apprehensive about even reading this book, and I was right.The 'interviews' with Janis and Jim are cartoonish, 'feed me a line I'll feed you a line' Freudian foul ups, cardboard portrayals of both legends, and flimsy indeed. Read some real interviews with Morrison to see how different the character in these ludicrous interviews are and how subtle, unpretentious and sincere the real man was. The diagnosis is feasible, but so is any other diagnosis.Horrble."
3,research,"Unfortunately there are some problems with the period detail. In the late nineteenth century it would not have been possible to leave London by train after a morning meeting, travel to Princetown, make a visit to the prison and then be back in London on the same day in the evening 'but not very late'. It would be pretty impossible to do it even today."
5,Awesome Value!!,"This thing is built like a freight train and is incredibly accurate and repeatable. As mentioned in the previous review, it now includes adapters for use with wide insert plates. The first thing to do after mounting it is replace the MDF fence faces with hardwood ones and make several pairs so you can make them zero clearance."
1,BAD SEELER,I advice anybody to avoid buying from arabia bazzar website because i bought agarwood by almost $ 170. I paid them money but they did not send me the package. I have tried to find a phone to call them but they did not have one. They did have an email which is a silent email. I have emailed them more than one time but they did not reply to me so far. I ADVICE ANYONE TO AVOID FALLING IN MY FAULT.
4,Zigview SC,The producd does what it says it will do. Helps in tight situations there are times when you don't want your face plastered against the camera bodyThe zigview allows you the freedom to view your shot with the camera away from your face. Im using this on a Canon XTI where you have to look through the view finder.
4,Not the usual Betty Neels,"I go to this author for a gentle escape from a hard day. And she delivers it. As with many Harlequin writers, she had a formula but she truly shined when she broke from the formula, as here."
5,A Classic and a favorite,"The original story has Rapunzel getting pregnant in the tower. To change it wouldn't make sense. Personally, I feel that there's nothing wrong with sex and I would welcome any questions from my child, but this story hasn't illicited any. Giving birth to twins and raising them in the desert is essential to the symbolism in the story. I am grateful that this story wasn't tinkered with."
4,"Great pictures, classic story","Beautiful pictures tell the classic story of Rapunzel. It is best for kids 4 and older, I would say, as some of the pictures are a little scary. Otherwise, great book!"
4,Where's the Gloves,"Works great for what I need it for, working on Go-Kart equipment during the race was a breeze when you're pressed for time. However, Makita promised work gloves with this and they didn't send them, nor a note saying they're out of them so don't count on that, no big deal. However, a friend just found one at a store with 14-volt for $100 cheaper, so now I feel cheated. Oh well."
5,Tell it like it is!!!,"The book is written in an understandable language for the lay person. It provides plenty of examples and tables which back up what the author is saying. In addition, the author provides worksheets from his website which helps readers to calculate mort. payment, etc. The reader definately will have a knowledge of how to negotiate your interest rate and eliminate unnecessary fees. The author touches on the topic of credit which is what we all need to obtain a house. If you're tired of being abused by individuals in the industry, then this book is for you."
4,Saving on home mortgage,"book good as far as it went. For my purposes the amortization tablez did not go far enough, The tables stopped at $200,.000.00"
4,Good Blades,I use saws all the time for cuting base moulding for repairs these blades are fast and acurate. Much simpler than a hand saw.
3,Looking for Mr.Right,"Alice is a young woman in her late twenties who has been persuaded by her old school friend Natasha, to come to stay with her in Los Angeles. She gets a job as a publicist at an agency which handles celebrities and begins to experience, at first hand, the hectic life of an unattached young woman in LA, with all of its attendant perils of lecherous, self absorbed men, madly jealous female co workers and people with the intellectual depth of about an inch. She meets and falls for a charming Irishman but, in an insane effort to not let herself be hurt as she was in a previous relationship, she does everything to put him off. At this stage, I became very testy with the character and wanted very much to give her a big shove and tell her to wake up to herself and get on with it...I suppose that this means that this book was a bit too chick lit for me!"
2,Disappointed,First book by the Auther that I have read and I am pretty let down. I'm going to give another one by her a try though because this one had potentional.
4,"Well focused, highlighting Ilya's strengths, in fine sound","Downes is well focused and objective in his conducting. The result is a performance that might lack some of the thrills and spills of (say) Stokowski or Ormandy, but emphasises the work's symphonic strength and minimises any feeling that the work is simply too long. No prospect here of spilling over onto 2 CDs, despite being absolutely uncut, unlike some other versions (notably Stokowski who excises half of the score!). The BBC Philharmonic play splendidly. The recording from BBC's Manchester Studios is aptly spacious and well balanced."
2,Pheromone,"Im kinda dissapointed....it smells like my grandma's eau de cologne, and I think it's more for adult women, after 45, but for young girl (25-35) the scent is too heavy. But Im still using it, just because Im courieuse if its really works and I didn't noticed that it attracts men... It is just regular, a bit stinky parfume...."
3,LIGHTER VERSION OF NORELL,THIS COULD BE A SISTER OF NORELL BY FIVE STAR FRAGRANCE. A VERY GREEN DRYDOWN ON IT. THE POWDER THAT I LOVE SO MUCH FADES INTO THE ABYSS. I WANT POWDER NOT NORELL. I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF NORELL. ITS NOT THE WORSE THING IVE EVER WORN BUT NOT MY FAVORITE BY A LONG SHOT EITHER.
3,Tried it Don't Prefer It,"I have been looking for a new scent to try out. I seen this on sale and thought what the heck. I don't like this scent and I wish I could return it. This is a heavy scent. If you like Opium, Patchouli types of scents then this is for you. It would be a great value for you. It does last a long time. It is just not for me."
2,smells like bathroom,i thought about buying it after a lot of good reviews but the smell reminds me of a public bathroom in a clean restaurant which is not exactly what i was looking for in my purchase. Will not buy agian smells too much like olddddddddddd.You can judge for yourself but if your in your mid 20's i can guarentee this is not what you want to smell like!!!
3,Anne Mather,"Jason Tarrant hadn't wanted a teenage ward wished on to him - and he wanted it even les when the boy he had expected turned out to be a girl; an estancia in South America was hardly the place for someone like Alex Durham. And when Alex, in her artless way, began to throw herself at his head the situation looked like really getting out of hand..."
4,After 24 months,"I purchased this machine with the idea that I would give up my router table. I have and use both the shaper and the router table. The shaper I use for heavy cutting application with 4/4 and above projects. It eats wood - and in doing so cuts time required for any project. As a furniture maker my projects normally require some shaping. Under 4/4 wood the router table is the primary shaping power tool I use usless we are making repeated cuts as in machining flooring - then the shaper is the tool of choice. I have run about 4,000 brd feet through the shaper. If I had the need and was looking for another shaper I would purchase this one again."
1,Total waste,"I purchased this surgical binder and after one wearing I tossed it in the bin. It was difficult to put on and it rolled over after a short period of use.I was approached by a rep of the company to ask that I remove the unfavorable review that I had posted earlier. They proposed a full refund if I erased my negative comments.Against my better judgement and principles I agreed, but never did receive reimbursement even after filing a complaint with Amazon. Very poor business practice.My review will stay this time, regardless of temptation. This is not a product I would recommend, especially after finding far better alternatives that satisfy my needs."
3,Fits small,This binder is firm and comfortable but fits small. Could hardly get this medium (34 to 40 inch) around my 34 inch waist! Additionally it tore at side seams first time it was worn. Recommend buying one size up.
2,LIght weight three set deadblow hammer set,These deadblow hammers smell something awful. They smell like rubber real loudly. The handles are hard on the hands but they are the right weight for little jobs.
2,Ergonomically Challenged Clock,"I bought this clock mainly because of the quiet-to-louder wake up feature. That part works well, but the clocks design is stupid, in my opinion, e.g. a large button that shuts off the alarm till the next morning is next to the Snooze Bar, duh! And the Snooze Bar is relatively small.So, if you're one who uses a Snooze Bar, like groggy me, then move on 'cause this thing will make you late when you reach over and accidently hit the off button instead of the Snooze. I did get more sleep because of this clock, but the boss wasn't too happy. :)"
1,Don't waste your money,"At first I didn't like it because the green LED is so bright it's worse than a night light. When it sat on my nightstand and faced toward me, the light would shine in my face. Then ~40 days after I bought it, the alarm set feature went kaput. So much for an alarm clock. In the trash!"
4,Easy to use!,"I bought this alarm clock, becuase my trusty 20 year old alarm clock finally kicked the bucket. I promptly unpacked the alarm clock, threw away all the packing materials and instructions, and forgot about plugging it in for a week. When I finally plugged it in, the clock set itself. I have no idea how this works, but, work it did. You just have to set the knob for whatever time zone you are in, and apparetnly faries do the rest. You can set two different wake up times, and it is easy to adjust the alarm timer either earlier or later. You can select being awakened by either the radio or a piercing beep. (Can't sleep through that one, no matter how I try) I have no complaints, the controls are intuitive and easy enough for me to figure out in the middle of the night. I would give it five stars, but I am morally opposed to giving an alarm clock too much praise."
1,Shame on you GE,"I too was fooled in thinking that auto-time set meant from the Atomic clock in Boulder Colorado.It became apparant immediatly because the factory preset the time wrong (and no not because of the time zone switch), they had it :12 minutes past hour when it was actually :22 past hour.So the very first time I had to set it anyhow. I wanted the atomic feature to insure daily recalibration and accuracy.Oh well, at least twice a year when I have to make the adjustment for time change I am reminded to never buy a GE product again."
3,Adequate Post-Apocalyptic Thriller,"This is another in a long series of Post-Apocalyptic novels that I have read over the past several years. This is not among the best of this genre but it is definitely not among the worst either.First published in 1990 by ROC the story is told in the not so distant future. A king rules what is left of America. Edward III is the pompous sack of compost that rules what is left of North America. The disaster of our times has left much the land flooded and the landscape greatly changed.As is true in many of these books the Post-Apocalyptic society is riddled with pseudo-religious organizations. In most ways this is a standard adventure novel in the vein of ""A Canticle for Leibowitz"", although not as well executed.Rebecca Meluch has done an admirable job with this book and hopefully she will continue to improve. She has written at least two other novels as of this date, Sovereign and Jerusalem Fire, which I have not read."
4,its good for new beginers,atfirst i thought there are only less number of asanas.but later i recognized if we practice those asanas expecially women we can enjoy life
5,Beautiful Works by Visionary Tristan Murail,"This recording of Tristan Murail's Gondwana, Désintégrations and Time and Again is an essential addition to a music lover's library. Great orchestral performances combined with seminal works of the so called spectral school's leading composer. It is amazing that the electronic components were realized on archaic synthesizers such as the DX7 - Murail is one of the few composers to really understand and explore the possibilities of electro-acoustic music and who used his available resources (in the early 1980s) brilliantly. If you are like me, you will want to listen to this disc again and again."
4,Enjoyed,I enjoyed the series overall. There were a few places the character's action/logic was a little forced. You could tell the actions were more a need of the story than a normal response to the situation. The authors gender also shows through pretty clearly. I hope to read more from her and expect that she will get more polished with each book.
2,Still as boring as the first.,"Spoiler Alert!My bf wanted me to read the series... So I tried... Still nothing happening. Sonea gets picked on repetitively. For a while I thought she was like 13 or 14 since she acts so weak. My mind is shattered to remember that she is about 18 and being picked on by kids younger than her. And really? Just to torture someone, Regin also studies his butt off just to stay in the same grade level as her? Yea... right. They already talked about how hard it was in the first place for Sonea to move up a grade level and Regin just easily does it on top of picking on her throughout the first and part second books, as if he never studied at all. And does Regin's guardian Lord Garrel not get reprimanded for obviously helping Regin frame her for stealing? wth? This story has many holes in it and is ridiculous. I skimmed in order to finish the book because, like the first, it still drags on and is repetitive."
1,spend your money on a dewalt,"I bought this planer a couple of years ago and have regretted it ever since. The feed rollers cannot pull the stock through if the temperature is under about 80 degrees, you have to push and then pull the piece through. The knives must be made of very brittle steel,(typical of chinese steel) because they will chip if you give them a stern look. From what I can see this planer is just more chinese trash. I may post video when summer gets here of a D-9 Cat running this piece of junk over. Buy a DeWalt or any other brand you like but stay away from this pile of Delta garbage."
3,High Blood Pressure Information,I read through the book but found it did not have as much useful information as I expected it might.
3,just a ok book,"This book is just ok to read, but some of the information in here goes way beyond the average layman or ""dummy"".It is somewhat useful and informative but not greatly so.There is nothing wrong with this book, just nothing that great about it."
5,Great book!,I LOVE this book! This is my first Phyllis Whitney novel and I can't wait to read another! The only problem with this book is that she seems to drift off and talk about things that don't matter and soon i find myself bored. This is still a great book! It's creepy and fun!
1,Another Ego Trip,"I was going to give this book two stars, one for the effort made by Harrison, and another so that I wouldn't look like a chump. I'll look like a chump, then.I was happy to find Spilling Over hidden amongst the books I browsed at the bookstore. The art was cool. After purchasing and reading the book, however, the project as a whole made me a little nauseous--there was an abundant amount of egotism to swallow and a not-very-unique story told.Some artists and some authors develop an overbearing ME on the success of their work, which then becomes rather unpalatable to some people. And, I feel like Harrison is guilty of that sin in Brave on the Rocks. It's like...get over it, already. Evolve, already. Brave is just more pages of the first book.I don't mean to completely knock Harrison. It's that this art is just not -that- worthy. But, if you dig this style, and you simply want to look at more of the same, that's cool, too. Enjoy."
1,"Not the Best Book, Not the Best Writer","There have been some informed and insightful commentaries on the terrorism problem. This is not one of them. Gunaratna has no real background in Islamic studies or the Middle East and it shows. It might impress people who have no real knowledge of the terrorist problem, but it is likely only to mislead them. Gunaratna is a former intelligence officer for the Sri Lankan Government. With that war largely over, Gunaratna has jumped on the counter-terrorism bandwagon and is marketing himself as an expert on international terrorism. Whether you buy what he says here or elsewhere is up to you. Some of the inaccuracies in this book were highlighted in an article in the Australian newspaper The Age."
1,Trying to Sell Common Sense,Most of these recipes are either common sense or don't work. Stick with magazine recipes and modify them accordingly. The book is also too small and thin to be sold. Better make it a free pamphlet.
2,Quality issues,"This systems is the next evolution of the HT900 and HT920. Both of which had designed flaws. I spoke with a panasonic service engineer about the HT900 and he verified a popping noice coming from my sub was a know issue with the sub, but no recall was issues. After 3 months of discussion they replaced with 920. After owning a little over a year I had issues with the sub on this system also. There local certified repair company told me there was an issue with the design of the circuit board on this system. Different problem from the 900. They said they though Pansonic would replace but after numerous conversations they did not. They make good TVs but low quality Home Theaters in a Box and don't stand behind their product."
2,Bad casters,"This seems to be a fairly solid stand, but beware of the casters. The center portion is hard plastic covered with a hard rubber. I have one for my table saw and one for my shaper, about a month old and with four of the casters the hard rubber cover has broken off. I don't expect the other four casters to last long either. Unfortunately, the only casters I have found so far with the same hole distances are the same casters. Now I'm looking into replacing the wheels but need to determine the correct hole bore. I wonder if I can roll it around on the hard plastic wheels. With a 500 lb saw on the base, this is not the time to have to deal with replacing the wheels. Look for a base with solid rubber wheels."
1,Their caster wheels are junk,"Bought this base from Woodcraft; usually I find their stuff is well made and durable. HOWEVER, this piece of junk is an exception. I have a Jet Gold Series band saw mounted on it -- there's not a lot of weight to put much wear and tear on it, but so far, two wheels have crumbled, and it looks like a third is starting to go. While it's possible to replace the wheels, it can be a bit of a pain when you have equipment already mounted to the base. I'm going to keep an eye out for metal wheels, and replace them all so I don't have to keep dealing with the problem.If you're considering this base, save your money and time...go with an HTC or just replace the wheels on this one BEFORE you mount any equipment to it."
3,Install Mods,"I installed this item under a Grizzly 1022z table saw and had to perform the following modifications:I made up four 1.5 inch angle iron pieces 2 1/4' long, mig welded them to the bottom of the saw while the saw was sitting on the assembly extended outward to where I wanted it after they were bolted with the metric bolts to the Shop Fax unit. This really solidified the saw like a rock. Then constructed two 1/4"" spacer blocks for the rear wheels only so that after adjusting the front adjusters to raise the front wheels off the floor the saw would be level. Otherwise it is 1/4"" out of level. The plastic adjuster knob on one of the adjusters shattered but the bolt head that was left was sufficient to rotate the adjuster. I didn't really need the knobs anyway so I busted the other one. I'm happy with it now.JJK"
5,As Smooth as a Sewing Machine,"I love this saw. I bought it from Home Depot for $90 plus tax (price matched Lowes plus 10%). It cuts like butter and it is so smooth. I wanted one with a brake, but nobody in my area carried one and I had to have it that day. I really don't miss the brake and it is one less thing to break, so it all worked out for the best. The Makita 5007 series is a great saw. I chose this saw over Porter Cable, Milwalkee, Bosh, Skil,Dewalt, etc. I am a big Makita fan (I have the 10"" sliding miter saw as well). I highly recommend it!"
1,Er...uh...wow...,"I got this movie for my birthday this year since I am a huge Johnny Depp fan (love him in 21 Jump Street, Pirates of the Carribbean, Nightmare on Elm Street-even though he died!, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory...etc) so my friend and I sat down to watch this movie and we were absolutely confused within the first thirty minutes. It made zero sense, the characters were very over the top, that girl turned into a greaser (or whatever they called them) WAYYYY to fast for someone like her, I mean I know that it's supposed to probably be just some cool and funny pointless movie but all in all, it's right up there with Napoleon Dynamite for me...lame.The only reasons I gave it 1 star is because A. Johnny Depp is in it. B. They don't give you a choice lower than one and C. JOHNNY DEPP IS IN IT!But overall...not one of Johnny's best and definitely not one I recommend."
3,About as good as Hairspray,"Generally, I'm not that into musicals, and I wasn't enthralled by this one. It's about as good as Hairspray. If you liked Hairspray, you'll probably like Cry Baby."
5,Memories,"I used to love watching this movie as a kid. This was the first movie to expose me to Johnny Depp. I was very happy with the product I received, and how fast I received it. It's so cheesy and funny. Don't be a square. Buy it! Lol"
4,love the goofy movie,I remember watching this over and over as a teen so bought it to watch with my teenage daughter. My hubby watched it with us laughing. It is a goofy movie but enjoyable. Price is perfect.
4,Johnny can SING,"i like this movie a lot! i saw it the other day for the first time on WE *womens entertainment* they were having this special men we love and i was like ""OH YES WE DO LUV JOHNNY DEPP!"" i guess im obsessed... LOL anyway... this movie is stupid but thats what makes it so funny! Alison is a square... Cry-Baby Walker is a drape (punker type person)... they fall in luv but the other squares dont like that... they fight and in the end (naturally) it ends up like Happily Ever After. Johnny isn't exactly bad in this movie... its just cheesy but i think ANY and ALL fans of Johnny will appreciate this because its only like his fifth movie or so..."
4,must see,This film has been one of my favourites since i can remember. Johnny Depp is outstandingly gorgeous and the humour comes sure and fast. Not once did i want it to end and on many occasions i have caught myself singing and dancing along to the songs. A must see for any Depp fans...in fact a must see for everyone.
3,"Pretty good, but...","This movie isn't really all that good, sorry, I am a John Waters fan, but this movie ain't no pink flamingos. It has more funny parts than Hairspray, but Hairspray is more entertaining. And it's not as good as any of John Waters' 'Divine Comedies'.But about the cast, Ricki Lake was funnier in this than in Hairspray, and the music is better. And I think the girl that played Hatchet face is almost identical to Edith massey. John Waters has said he would like to produce 'Flamingos Forever'. This girl could be Mama Edie, but I don't know who could be Babs. I mean, Divine WAS Babs. Well, I don't know. Overall, this movie was just not as funny as Polyester or his earlier works, and lacks the 'Independent' feel that makes his movies loveable. ( or loath-able)"
2,Not one of Waters's best,"This film pails in comparison to the greats like Polyester, Desperate Living and Female Trouble. Classic example of Waters playing to the mainstream and losing his fans in the process.Still, the film does have some good merits like Rikki Lake and the ugly girl, and is definitely a million times better than Cecil B. Demented."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,"I love Johnny Depp and think he is a terific actor who takes on difficult roles and does them wonderfully BUT THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE, I hated it, in fact I did not get through the whole movie.It reminded me of a very badly overacted Grease. As good looking as Johnny is, that cant carry this movie. Sorry I bought it as I could have watched it for free on Comcast On Demand:("
4,Hmmm,The beginning of this book was dull and was dull until they finally hit the iceberg. Even when it did hit the iceberg it seemed like nothing happened. I didn't like the main character and I didn't quite get what happened when there was a wave or something. Anyways the characters in the book predict the sinking to much. It seemed like Barry went back in time or something cause he knew it would sink! The people on the Titanic didn't think it would sink! Get a little more realistic!
2,<(-_-)> SOS THE TITANIC <(-_-)>,"In the book S.O.S titanic some very interesting things happen to Barry. First Barry sneaks out of his first class cabin late at night on board the RMS Titanic and he drops his grandpa's glove in steerage. As he goes down to steerage to get his glove he meets the Flyne boys that are also from Ireland but had to leave because of his grandparents, they inevitably get into a fight and Barry has to get stitches. Barry finds his glove and also meets a girl Peegen that he really starts to like A LOT! But the titanic has hit an iceberg and is starting to sink! She has no life jacket and is trapped in steerage, he frantically starts looking for her and gets there Just in time, they jump off the ship. They find a flipped life boat after a few hours. The next morning another ship comes and rescues the survivors."
4,An excellent read.,"This book is an exciting and enthralling read. I couldn't put it down. The story is coupled pleasantly with the action aspect of the story. The relationship and tension between Pegeen and Barry is a wonderful additive. While I won't vouch for historical accuracy here, nor is this novel TITANIC, but it's definatly a good book."
3,IT WAS A N OK BOOK,"It didn't really capture me at the begginng , but it got a little bit better as it went along. When the ship was sinking I don't think the athur described it as well as it should be, but other than that I think it was ok."
1,Said almost nothing on Titanic,"I hated it. It said very little on the sinking, in fact, practically nothing! It focused on almost all made-up characters who easily proved to be dull and brainless and how they acted while the ship sank (amazingly, many of the 1st class women Barry met decided to be stupid after the collsion and forget to get on a lifeboat until it was too late). I wouldn't suggest this book if you wanted to get facts on Titanic; it's terrible"
5,Great Book!,I just want to say this is my personal favorite book and is recommended to everyone... I've read it 7 times so far... and it gets better and better each time...
5,My granddaughter's favorite,"I bought this on-demand video for my granddaughter who loves Dora. It combines her favorite mythical creatures, mermaids, and Dora, her favorite comic character. She has watched this so many times that she knows all the dialog and actually uses the Spanish words in real conversations. This is an excellent way of getting a young child familiar with another language that she can make her own."
5,I like mine,"I've had this stapler for over a year now. It has done everything I expected it to do. No misfires, no problems. Couldn't ask for more. After reading the reviews here I guess it comes down to luck. Do you feel lucky? I chose this particular one even though the salesman at Home Depot suggested I not pick it. Funny thing, however, this same sales person, when told that I was looking to replace a Craftsman pneumatic stapler, said that owning a Craftsman would be slightly worse than not having one at all. He was right. I was lucky and I'd do it again."
1,Microphones,"This unit is very good, but the microphones has failed on both units. I can not order a replacement,not a very good product."
5,Execellent buy for the money,I had my first opportunity to use the Pyle Wireless PA System. It performed great. I used the wireless microphone and a wired microphone. The sound was sufficiently loud enough for a group of 50 people to hear. The only downside I discovered was added additional wireless microphones. There was a lot of feedback that made them unuseable with the internal wireless microphone. I am going to try a better quality add on wireless to see if that makes a difference. I will be using the PA with a larger group and larger room this weekend. I may have more to say about that application. Bottom line good price and good quality.
3,high maintenance,"I like the price for this item, and it's very mobile--but there were no instructions, warnings or information for how to care for this item in the box; I need to know how far away I can stand away from the speakers etc., for the mic goes in and out: kind of annoying."
5,Excellent Sound System,"This is perfect for me. It has great sound. Even turned up really loud, it's still very clear. Highly recommend!"
5,WATCH OUT FOR VS6SP3 AND THIS CODE!,"I like this book. It is interesting the polar opinions on it: a few hate it. ISTM that they don't understand that the book is a work of clear pedagogy. These people seem threatened by something that is well-written, almost as if it punctures their cloud of confusion..Fascinating- these reviews. <paragraph> OK - the code doesn't work under VS6 SP3 because the TagContents string (which is what gets substituted in the template for sending to the browser) gets truncated. A workaround is: 1. put <WC@fix></WC@fix> at the end of your html template file. 2. In ProcessTag event code put: Case ""WC@fix"" 'then on next line: TagContents = Space$(32768)This fools faulty SP3 dll into allocating a large enough buffer."
2,not what I expected from Delta,"I've owned this saw for a little more than two months and have to say the saw performs well. It's the Biesemeyer Fence and table system that is part of a never ending problem (Biesemeyer is now own by Delta). All previous reviews found assembly problems with the side and out feed tables. Reviews that seem to have vanished? The cast iron wings tables are also anything but flush with the main table deck. I would check in to other saws if I had to do it over. The unisaw was a great saw, but feel delta has let thing go down hill."
5,Great Dinnerware,"I purchased 3 sets of the 16 piece Mikasa Italian Countryside Dinnerware approx one month ago. These are beautiful dishes and I'm very pleased with them. The sets came packaged very well. There was only 1 bowl that was cracked. When I contacted Amazon Customer Service, I asked them to replace the broken bowl but they wanted me to return one full 16 piece set. I didn't see a good reason to send back 16 pieces for one bowl. They finally agreed to credit my account the cost of the bowl which was fine with me. The Italian Countryside can be purchased as individual pieces so I was able to replace the bowl very easily."
5,A must read for those of us who want to remain free,"For those of us who know little to nothing about our Constitutional rights and would like to see how our freedoms are methodicaly being stripped from us, you must read this book. It is a masterpiece of research and truth."
4,I couldn't put it down,"I read this book in 1996. It was my first real look into the workings of our government, inparticular our income tax system. Most of the information is well documented and I was able to verify it through my own research. I've read other books since then and this one is in many ways the best. It angered me to find out the truth about income tax and I've been trying to educate others since reading this. I used Ms. Meredith's method to become income tax free and suffered no negative repercussions to date. However, I've since found other methods to be more straight forward and easily defensible. But, I still highly recommend this book for it's informative value."
2,Not a great how-to book,"While I enjoyed the beautiful photographs and enjoyed reading the book, I did not get a grasp of how to start and finish a project."
1,I wonder if the author knows any WASPS,"Nanny Diaries is a more accurate and entertaining peak into the lives of superficial and rich housewives. After reading this book, I wondered if the author knows any WASPS in real life."
4,Some of the best DBZ movies,"Before I bought this box set, I had seen or owned all 3 of these movies, but when I learned of the rerecording and such I decided to get them again. I really didn't like the voices in DBZ before Funamation took over them, so I was pretty excited when they decided to go back and rerecord everything before that point. The only problem with this box set is the changing of the original Japanese music. The music they have now is boring, and I like the music they put in the series, you can tell they just wanted to put something in quick. The old English version has it, and the Japanese version, on these box sets, has it, I just don't like watching movies in Japanese. But in the end this is a good deal for all, and these voices are better. I recommend this to any DBZ fan."
1,Not a Reliable Tray,When I received the package it was all torn up. I was missing parts. It is hard for someone to walk when Tray is folded. It is also difficult to attach and re-attach.
2,"lightweight tool, but is this supposed to shoot nails?","I bought this gun after reading the mixed reviews, but I thought I would still give a name like Bostitch a try. The problem I encountered was that the nailgun misfired half the time which made it hard to tell if my trim was going to stay on the wall or not. So I went and exchanged it for another one thinking that I might have better luck. After trying for a few more weeks I think I'm ready for a Senco."
3,My Review,"First things first i want to say i ordered this deck and this people had some kind of brain fart and took the money out of my checking account then put it back the next day.So im thinking i was gonna get the deck for free.Well i was wrong they took the money out agin later that day and charged me twice for shipping.When they put the money back into my account they didnt put the shipping charges back so when they took it out agin they hit me twice for shipping about 60 bucks total.Oh yes it geats worse i finally get the deck and you can guess it was the wrong one.Thats right it wasnt the one i ordered but i was in a hurry for a deck so i didnt say anything i just keep it.Well i had it for about 3 months and i noticed that the screen flip down wouldnt flip down unless i helped it like the motor was going out or like it wasnt strong enough.But other than them few LITTLE issues great buy if you are broke and looking for a bargin like i was.REMEMBER ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR""!"
2,Beware: Only 1 episode,"As they say, Funimation definitely saw me coming.This is a nice story and we enjoyed watching it. Then the disk ended after the 1 episode. :-( $25 for 25 minutes. A very steep price indeed. I didn't notice this when I ordered it. Who'd have guessed that the publisher would limit the disks to 3 episodes/disk, then sell the last disk with only 1? Obviously they COULD have put that last episode on one of the previous disks. Also, now that I look on Amazon's page, there is no running time that I can find. That's kind of tacky.Regarding my rating, I'm somewhat torn. Combine the experiences of watching one of my favorite series with that of getting ripped off by the publisher. That averages to... a 2.I will be thinking twice & thrice before buying more from Funimation. I can only assume that the company is having financial difficulties. Otherwise, why jeopardize future sales byscrewing your customer so thoroughly?"
2,Don't Recommend,"I bought this book for my daughter to do as a summer workbook between 1st and 2nd grades. The material in the book is poor. The exercises are odd and confusing for children. The quality of the pages is also very low grade. It looks like a group people put together a bunch of random and odd pages to throw together this book. I'm an engineer, so it's not like I don't understand math. This book is a waste of money (don't let it's cheap price tempt you)!"
3,"THEY WERE ""REFUGEES"" IMMEDIATELY","Dr. Cobbs, you know America thanks you for this expose on the feelings of people who have been raging quietly for centuries. Sir, ""entitlement"" for them would mean ""humanity"" for us. Katrina may have been that wake-up call telling us that the rage is going to still be going on in the hearts of some Americans because their entitlement is still far and shortcoming.This is a close and intimate read about a subject that should shame America but it doesn't. Cobbs hand is trying to strike a balance between the way it is and the way it ought to be. Very encouraging.--Margaret Opine"
2,Questionable,"Consists of examples, letters and legal documentation in the remote chance that you'll follow it and try to dispute paying any taxes. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't .. but if you want to risk fines, legal fees and jail time to fight the system , this book is worth a look."
1,WONDERFUL GRINDER WHEN IT WORKS,"I BOUGHT THIS GRINDER ON 3/22/02. USED IT ABOUT 10 TIMES AND THEN THE VARIABLE SPEED DIDN'T WORK. TOOK IT IN TO THE DELTA FACTORY SERVICE CENTER IN DAVIE FLORIDA. IT TOOK THEM 6 WEEKS TO REPAIR THE UNIT. I TOOK IT HOME AND USED IT ABOUT 4 TIMES,THEN THE SPEED CONTROL BROKE AGAIN. I CALLED DELTA HOME OFFICE. THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD SEND ME THE PART AND I COULD TRY TO FIX IT MYSELF. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER."
3,"Great information, terrible read","This book has loads of great information. The problem is that it's scattered all over and an extremely difficult read. The readibility level is very low.If you are patient and have a lot of time, this book's for you. If neither applies, look for The Course of Irish History, by Moody and Martin. It has loads of great info AND is a great read.I gave it three stars simply for the information it contains. My personal rating is one star."
5,Loved this book!,"I have lived in Cleveland for 10 years, and I truly enjoyed this book. Mark managed to actually put me back in time in 1948 when Rock and Roll was just getting started in America. His description of the World Series game that the Indians won that year was exciting, and I don't even like baseball. I loved the love story in the book, and I loved the way it ended.This book is not just a book about Cleveland. It's a book about an era in American history. It's about life in the 50's; the birth of rock and roll; politics of the time; and love, not so different from what you and I experience today.About the river: It's hard to believe that the river was so polluted back then when it's so clean now -- hard to imagine. We really have come a long way. Cleveland rocks!!!I hope Mark's next novel will come out soon.Come and see us in Cleveland!"
1,Warcraft 3 clone with improvements,"I played the demo for this game (hence why I can review it before it is released). Lords of Everquest is basically a Warcraft3 clone. The concept, the name of the buildings, even down to the sayings the characters say. Granted, the animation is better and Sony did improve on a few things from W3, but it is a clone. The interface is easier than W3, but I haven't seen any story scenes so I can not judge the climax footage vs. W3. Basically, if you already own W3, getting this game is pointless since it is the same thing. It is nothing like EQ, Sony just slapped that name on it trying to get sales."
5,Great beginers book,"As a mother just begining to teach the ""birds and the bees"" this is a terrific help. The material is age appropriate and interesting to read. The best part, however, is the Christian aspect. I know that our children will understand and respect their sexuality more because they will know why God gave them this gift and the value of protecting that gift. Thank you for the Learning About Sex Series!"
2,Disappointing performance and sound,"Pollini's recording of the late Beethoven Sonatas (28-32) is outstanding in every way, full of verve and confidence, with a realistic piano sound. This recording of early sonatas pales by comparison. It sounds like he was having a bad day (as were the sound engineers). Performances are cold and rather uninspired, almost rote, while the piano has a strange remote muddy sound as if the microphones were badly placed according to the room. Schiff's live recording is better although the piano sound is barely above mediocre, Brendel's live recording of the 90's perhaps better still (but you have to put up with applause). Kovacevich's Philips recording of Nos.5 and 8 (available in a box set of sonatas and concertos) has the most realistic sound, but there's no 6 or 7. His EMI recordings are too trebly, lacking the warmth that the Philips engineers gave him. Then there's the older recordings of Kempff and Arrau with whom you can never go wrong on Beethoven."
1,A Very Poor Text On Discrete Mathematics,"Any professor or department which recommends this book to students as the primary, or only text of the class is doing a dis-service to students. The text provides examples and explanations which are incomplete and contain errors. In many of the proofs, key steps are omitted by the author who takes for granted that students will know of his mistakes and make corrections. Any prospective students who see this book as the only text of a computer science discrete mathematics class, should imediately change from that class, saving themselves many hours of aggrevation."
2,Not a good textbook,"This is probably the worst textbook I've ever had to use. If you don't already know the topics, the book does little to help you learn them. It simply spews theorems and then shows examples (with little explanation). A few simple step-by-step explanations would go a long way to understanding the subject material."
2,Just plain confusing...,"This book is pretty useless when it comes to explaining concepts that it attempts to teach. It skips steps and fails to explain how to solve a lot of problems. I usually have to have a math tutor, or the teacher explain the lessons to me, because the 15-page sections in the book seem to get me nowhere. I wouldn't have a problem with discrete math if we had a different textbook."
1,I failed my class because of this book,I can not understand why our teacher decided to use this book?i am very disappointed.No one words...
2,Not something to rely on for teaching,"I am not impressd with this book. There are 54 pages of actual work pages, and only three pages on division. That is not nearly enough to teach division, let alone practice it. Some of the pages are way too simple, but on others there are a lot of 3 digit problems, which would not be a bad thing if they weren't crammed into small geometric shapes that the child is supposed to color afterward. 3rd graders should be too old for that. If I wanted my child to color, I'd buy a coloring book. I gave my child scratch paper so that he wouldn't have to try to fit his work into spaces barely able to contain the problems. This book is full of busy work for a child who already knows all the stuff in it. I will not be buying any more books from this series. Yes, you can teach from it, but expect to supplement heavily. At least it's cheap."
4,very interesting and enjoyable.,"I purchased this book so I could learn how to make Shoji screens, Lanterns and etc. It's informative and an easy read."
5,sun / heat shield,"Great product. Good materials used and the fit is perfect. I can install it in seconds. It reduces the heat build up in our cars and reduces the ""cook"" on the leather seats that direct sunlight produces. It seems a bit pricey, but I found it well worth the cost."
1,Not able to use on my iPod,"I purchased this to REPLACE my vinyl and old scratched up CD versions. Yes, I own the original vinyl AND the original CD release. I love the music. I wanted to finally add it to my MP3 collection of which I actually BUY all the music in. Oh, and I don't give copies away like the music companies say we all do......... anyhow, I bought this only to find that it's full of copy protection crap. So much in fact that this thing it totally useless to me. Instead of a happy moment I ended up with frustration. I wanted to put the thing on my iPod but no, I'm not ""allowed"" to do that. As i said, I now own 3 copies of this which I purchased. Nice to be punished. Anyhow, I'm sending it back and I'll rip from the other that I have or better yet, download it all for free since that's kinda what we're all being pushed to do. They make it harder and harder to do the right thing, in time it'll all just fall apart on them. Enjoy the cash, big brother, but it will no longer be mine."
2,Not Good,Bought it for my wife. She thought she was a big fan until she listened to it. We never played it again.
2,He is Ok,"so finally Taylor Hicks Album hits&it's pretty much what was expected. the Personality that worked on Tv doesn't come through on the Disc. Hicks has a Husky Whisley voice that works in places,but He isn't that deep of a Vocalist to truly make the material he is presented with sound more than a Hired voice on top of the Production basically.his material will work better on Adult Contempary,but He doesn't have that ""IT"" Song from this collection. he has the makings of a JourneyMan Artist. He might have some Hits,but on a whole if this is gonna be how he is presenting his work then Idol will more than likely be His Musical high."
2,I liked him on idol,"I liked him on american idol, but dont like this cd as much-hes sounds totally different and not the guy i voted for. and his cd isnt selling that great also-so i think alot of folks agree with me! sorry taylor maybe your next cd will be better!"
3,Taylor,I was greatly disappointed in this CD. I was a fan of Taylor Hicks from the beginning of American Idol but this CD did not do him justice. I think I would rather see him in person than listen to him on CD. Something was lost in the transition.
5,Taylor Hicks has it!!,"Taylor Hicks, Kelly Clarkson, and Clay Aiken are the cream of the crop.Taylor came along already seasoned and managed to maintain his style throughout ""Idol"". His first 2-song CD was fantastic and I think thatthis first album is quite good. Taylor was wonderful, although I do thinkhe is electrified by a live audience and might consider a live album somewhere soon down the line. I felt some of the songs were kind of weak on this album, but Taylor himself and the musical accompaniment was fivestar all the way. I look forward to many more albums and encourage him tostick to his style. To top it off, Taylor seems like a genuinely nice guy and I knew he was the one when he crossed that floor playing his harmonica for the judges. We love you, Taylor."
3,still waiting for Tupelo Honey,"I found the songs on this cd to be too boring and generic. I would still love to see Taylor do stuff along the lines of Van Morrison's ""Tupelo Honey""-- with more heart and less ""pop""."
5,Well worth the price. I recommend to everyone.,"It's been a long time since I've purchased a CD where I've enjoyed every song on it. This is one of them. I highly recommend checking out this CD and all it has to offer. It has everything from songs you can dance to, to songs you can feel the mood - soulful, meaningful, & full of feeling. This singers voice soars & has a richness to it that is hard to find. I think this musician will be around for a very long time. Classic."
3,I loved him on American Idol,"I listened to this CD and was sooooo disappointed until the last song, ""The Right Place"", a song with a soul vibe that Taylor owned.I guess Clive Barker is suppose to know what he is doing butTaylor Hicks is wasted singing over produced pop pap. Taylor is a great performer who has been pushed into the American Idol cookie cutter. What a shame. I'd love to have seen Taylor in his pre-American Idol days when he sang from his heart and blew his harp. I also want Taylor to be a roaring success because he has worked so long and hard to make it. This CD isn't his star vehicle but I'm glad I bought it if only to support him. He's got heart and soul and I hope he gets a chance to break away from the ""music machine"" and make a CD that is HIS."
3,Soulful but I thought it would be more,"I was one of many who voted for him on American Idol. I went out and bought his single release ""Do I Make You Proud"" and loved it! This cd is just not doing it for me. The last three songs are to my liking but the other songs are boring. This cd will appeal to my age group (30 - 50) and young teens surely won't buy it. Sorry Taylor but we want to see something more with an edge to it. It's just not covering worldwide here. I'm sure in the next album he will do better."
5,Wonderful CD!,"I love this CD!! The songs are perfect for Taylor's voice, and it is really fun. I highly recommend it-it is a nice change from all the Christmas music."
5,Love it!,"Usually I end up liking only a couple songs on a CD, but this one is a real gem. Taylor Hicks' voice and phrasing combine to make the most of whatever he sings. He chose songs that really let him emote and show off his unique voice. If I had to compare him to someone I'd say he reminds me of Elvis. This fellow will be around for a long time...I imagine his popularity will grow most from watching him perform because the whole package is thoroughly entertaining. This new release should cinch his success. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see him get into movies, too."
1,Too delayed,"First the good news. I have not laid out a cent because all the parts have been covered, but it was painful to prove to NEW when I purchased this, the verification of the model number, etc..The bad news. I have been waiting since October 2009 for the elliptical to be fixed. It is now April 18, 2010. Parts have been ""on back order"" repeatedly.I agree with the review on us doing our homework first. I should have. Avoid NEW Preferred Product Protection Plan AT ALL COSTS. You can do much better out there with others.Zero star rating. I wish I could use Amazon to pull some muscle."
2,Great idea but not ready yet for real use,"I wonder why the manufacturer sells something that obviously is not ready for market. The product is overpriced, difficult to use, and about as accurate as voice-recognition software."
2,Isn't It Ironic,"Isn't it ironic that one of Alanis's biggest hits, ""Ironic"" isn't represented here? Check the track listing that Amazon provides above."
3,Hits & Misses,"Alanis Morissette exploded onto the music scene in 1995 with Jagged Little Pill. The raw emotion and deep lyrics made it a major best seller and a classic. It remains Ms. Morissette's best moment and the songs from that album far outshine other the other tracks included in The Collection. The emotional drama that made Jagged Little Pill so great found Ms. Morissette confused by fame and psychobabble lyrics dominate her future releases. While there are some good songs like the haunting ""Uninvited"" from the City Of Angels soundtrack, the balance of the songs don't live up to Ms. Morissette's early promise."
4,More standards please!,I like most of her music but the song LET'S DO IT blew me away when I first heard/saw it in the Cole Porter movie a year or so ago. I truly wish she would do an entire CD of old standards like that or a CD of Cole Porter songs.
4,very good,the cd came early and was in great condition. i love the cd very much and will buy from this person again.
1,Skype better come up with something quick or they will start losing market share!,"Do not buy this unit. I have tested the VoSky, IOGEAR and now US Robotics and they are ALL junk. While the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate. I do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit. And why are the SO SMALL!? The are so small as to be practically useless. The IOGEAR unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons.Bottom line: Wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a Polycom and the Computer Calling Kit that is available through Polycom. (Even the Polycom Computer Calling Kit is analog! What is the problem!?)"
1,Bad quality USB speakerphone,This is a USB speakerphone of the worst quality I've ever seen. The sound quality is bad. My partner can hardly hear what I said. It is not the loudness but the echo. I will not recommend this speakerphone to anyone.
4,"If You Ever Been to Guilin in China, You have to see this Moive!","This movie is all about Guilin, Guang xi Folk Song... It was orginally shot in 50's or 60's, really long long time ago. That's why this DVD the picture quality is okay, which hence the 4 stars. And the color is added later on. The original movie is black and white...I have been to Guilin, this movie reminds me of Li RIver, Yang Shuo, all beaufitufl landscapes .. and beautiful Guang Xi folk song..."
2,cheap,i bought these cymbals for my 5 year old son. It served him well but the sound of the cymbal was cheap.
5,Thoroughly Gripping Novel,An exceptionally good novel. I savored it from beginning to end. We worth the time and effort to read. I was sad when the novel ended.
4,A great start got lost somewhere along the way,"Love science fiction - always thrilled to find something out of the ordinary, like a sci-fi story with a gay protagonist. McHugh does a great job describing a future world where China has become the one and only power, with all other cultures falling in its wake. Her take on the cultural customs that would emerge from such a scenario feels right on. The themes and obstacle experienced by Zhang are recognizable as concerns alive and well today - making the story believable and relatable.Unfortunately one can only take in-depth descriptions of surreal forms of architectural design so far and McHugh went a little past that. Still, I look forward to reading more from this author."
3,Nevermind.,"This was SUPPOSED to be one of the most unscience fictional books ever. I read on the author's webpage she was trying to be opposite to what science fiction readers expect. So we get a story with no plot, where none of the characters do anything important in the grand scheme of things, & nothing much happens. Yes that is more like real life, & perhaps this is the great American anti-science fiction novel she was hoping for, but a part of me says so what. Do you actually like said novel? Well, although I like parts of it ultimately my answer is no. I will give her credit for taking the road less traveled & doing a fair job of it."
2,One of the most un-science fictional books I've ever read.,"That includes non-sf by Hawthorne, London, Voltaire, & Dante. I decided to read it because I liked ""The Lincoln Train"" , a story that originally appeared in the Magazine of Fantasy & Science fiction, a great deal. However it didn't even readd like a novel since the different threads of the story only tenuously connected. Strangely, though I can talk longer about what I liked then what I didn't like. The part about the Martian goat farmer I loved. That's partly because it had the only likeable heterosexual male I can remember. I also loved the insights into Chinese culture. Even the parts in Canada were interesting. The book is quite real yet somehow ,for me, the book is less then the some of its parts. I can't say why it struck me that way, but it did. However if you like gay or feminist fiction I think you'll like it. I give it a 5 out of 10 actually."
4,We may retire the Nikon,"This is my first digital camera, and I am most pleased. It was purchased to replace a middle grade 35mm point and shoot, but it appears that it will be able to do far more than that. Everyone comments on the battery usage, and the advice to buy two sets of rechargables is good. One must learn to remove the lens cap or suffer the noise, although so far no apparent damage. I do miss having a UV filter and am waiting for Olympus to offer one so I can dispense with the lens cap. Some of the bells and whistles like panorama, macro, and bracket shooting are in reality quite valuable. Red eye prevention is good, but the delay is more than I would like. The manual can be printed from disc, but if you do that, get a good 3-ring notebook to hold it and make yourself a little index everytime you look something up. It's a good value !"
1,Horrible camera,"This camera was horrible. Picture quality was the only good thing about it.Batteries - I burned through 8 AA batteries in the first day! Think about it. It's like getting a laptop and having to plunk 4 D size batteries in it to use it. Any small mobile electronic item that does NOT come with a Lithium Ion battery should be avoided in my opinion.Lens cap - piece of garbageShape - VERY awkward in you handsAnd much much more...I returned mine and bought another brandFor the same amount of money look to other brands, you'll find that they offer all that this lacks at similar prices"
1,Disappointed in Amazon.com,"Ordered the item on November 13. The item was available in 24 hours.My e-mail said that I would receive it on December 24th.Looking around the internet, I found a Olympus 4040 which was about 36 dollars more. On Amazon.com, the same camera is [a lot] more. So I ordered the other, it's in transit, and I CXLed the Amazon.com order for this camera.It's a shame. I really like getting my product from Amazon.com but if it's not in stock I wish they would say that up front. They sent the memory disk that I ordered. Meanwhile it sits on a table with no camera to use it in."
3,Tristan und Isolde,"The voices are so beautiful, but the acting, esepcially in the love duet is so cold, and does not show any emotions, contrary to said words that express deep love."
3,Pucker Factor 10: Memoir of a U.S. Army Helicopter Pilot in Vietnam,Very well written and enjoyable. Not your usual action packed Vietnam book. The author describes all facets of his eleven months in the air war. I thoroughly enjoyed his writing style. Lots of laughs.
4,If you want to learn about 8 frame hives this one if for you.,"This book covers information you need to use an 8 frame hive. Most people use 10 frame hives and thus most information that I have found has been for 10 frames.If you want to use the 8 frame hives then get this book. I have this and other books do to the fact I am using a 10 frame, will be setting up an 8 frame, and a top bar hive.Don't make this your only book though. Learn as much as you can about keeping bees."
5,great router,"I have only had this router for a month or so now, but so far everything has been working smoothly and I am impressed with the quality of all the Milwaukee tools I have so far. I bought this router based on its high praise and it has lived up to all the acclaim."
3,Carlisle's French attempt,"I was excited for another record from one of my favorites from the past. However, Belinda's sultry voice is best showcased on english tunes. Romance, Parisan flair, and sensuality were all but lost. Quel dommage. A bit disappointing, but saved by ""I Love Him"", ""La Vie En Rose (english version)"" and some jazzed up acoustics."
5,Book,"Very good. I am enjoying it very much.It is very simple, basic and understandable.It gets to the core of the Word. Try toremember the verse through out the day."
1,Piece of Junk,"The stand is good. That's the best I can say. After purchasing this planer and using it maybe 3 times it stopped feeding the stock. I had to push on the boards to get them to move through the tool. Well, the local shop ""fixed"" it twice then I returned it. It never worked well. The blades are also [poor]. They nick very easily."
1,Boring,"I don't understand all of the rave reviews.There were too many characters. Several chapters in, I still couldn't remember the names of every single person featured in this book. It seems these women have no lives besides pregnancies and bitching at their husbands. Stereotypical and trashy, unflattering and slow. For being older women, they act like their daughters: high school girls who only value immaturity and superficiality. Seriously, I don't distinguish between the two groups.Besides that, everything else is just predictable and cliche. Would not recommend to anybody."
4,something of each of them in all of us.........,"This is a warm souled, heartstring tugging story of the deep friendships of five English women who form a book group. The women cope with the many challenges life throws in their respective paths and forge deeper bonds with each other. The books that they read for their group open an opportunity for introspective thinking and each novel seems to reflect some aspect of the challenges facing them.They learn to face and contend with life's unexpected turns, playing the cards they are dealt, although none of them are above stacking the deck to help each other or themselves!!This is a fun story about these very different women, different ages, different backgrounds and different needs.....yet there is something of all of them in each of us. This is the thread that Elizabeth Noble uses to weave her delightful tale."
2,not terrible,"I had just finished 'Angry Housewives Eating Bon-Bons', another 'reading club' novel, and enjoyed it very much. I saw this in the store and it looked similar so I decided to read it. To be kind, it was not nearly as good. I did finish it, and it did get better as I continued, but I could have easily misplaced the book and not missed not being able to finish it."
4,Just Wonderful,"I just absolutely love this book. I bought this with the Landscape part of the series, with the hope to get more water. This book has it. It has a wonderful selection of snow scenes and even frost!!! It then has several different types of beach and ocean scenes. The one thing that I was really looking for that this book didn't have, which is why I gave it a 4, was that there was no rain. There were plenty of fog and mist, which were wonderful, but not a single rain picture. They had a few rainbows, but no rain. I thought it was interesting, but perhaps its just really that hard to take a picture of rain. So if your looking for a book with rain, I would suggest looking elsewere. If your just looking for a great book with lots of water and sky, this would be my pick!!"
4,Getting Better vibes now,"Updated review:See below for my original review. Purchased a new item from another vendor (amazon had a 3-4 week lead time to replace the one I returned). Much better results. In fact, I purchased a second one so we could run full practices for our U9 advanced and U10 advanced teams. They've held up well over the course of 3 weeks with lots of shots in and around net.RandyOriginal review:When I received and unpackaged this, I was excited (along with my kids). This seemed like a perfect practice net for their team. Unfortunately, the metal seam on the back tube split before I even got the unit set up. It was completely unusable.I don't know it this was an isolated incident or not, but it was very disappointing.The netting material seemed of good quality, and the design is sound. The frame material needs to be improved."
4,Good Product,"Only complaint I have after about two weeks of use, is that the middle of the net is getting some sag to it and as far as I know it can't be tightened. This could be because I put it up and have left it standing in the yard rather than taking it down when the kids are done playing. Otherwise, well made good product. Update to original review. I've left the product outside in the weather and the metal frame is rusting and fading in color. Also the net now has a tear in it. I think if you do as the instructions suggest and don't leave the net standing it will be fine."
1,HORRIBLE!,I can not believe all the good reviews! UN-pleasantly surprised! I trusted these reviews and got the brush but it is AWFUL! The static it causes my hair is unmanageable and the bristles are SHARP and actually hurt my head. I am sending it back asap! You are better off spending a little more and getting something better quality that is NOT made in CHINA!
1,Cheap Knockoff,Ordered this brush because of price and reviews. Received a cheap knockoff made in China. The brush points are very sharp and hurts to brush my head.
5,AWESOME BRUSH,"THIS IS THE BEST ROUND BRUSH THAT I'VE EVER USED! PERFECT SIZE DIAMETER, EASILY GRABS THE HAIR AND GIVES A NICE SOFT RESULT."
1,Questionable,"Hello everybody. I bought this brush a couple weeks ago, and after reading the reviews, didn't find anything to bad about it. After using it, I found that it was a great brush. It styles very well. The only problem I found with it, this being the reason I gave it only one star, was that it smelled terrible. I didn't notice this for a while, but I did, it was awful. I tried washing it, but nothing worked to get the smell out. I am not able to use it anymore."
2,Short hair.,"I have a short hair, and this brush hurt my skin when I brush with it. Maybe good for some people have long hair, not for me."
4,Sad but compelling independent film from China,"Zhou Xun is one of the most compelling actresses working today and she grabs you right from the start in this film. She plays a young woman whose parents, intellectuals from the previous generation, have abandoned her for the most part, shuffling her off to live in near poverty with her granny and aunt. Then she's accepted into university, raising her class status momentarily, but falls in love with a truck driver, gets pregnant and her life unravels. There's subtle and deep social commentary embracing this extremely sad tale of family, love, and one woman's struggle to survive in modern China. I was very surprised by the script. It's softly brutal."
5,excellent analysis of globalisation and the alternatives,"""There is an alternative"" gives and excellent analysis of globalisation from an ecofeminist/anti-colonial perspective. Most of the contributors have been influenced or inspired by the work of Maria Mies and the subsistence perspective that she and her colleagues have articulated. While there are so many analyses of globalisation these days, the ecofeminist perspective yields numerous new insights. For example, see Claudia von Werlhof's essay ""Losing Faith in Progress: Capitalist Patriarchy as an 'Alchemical System'"".More importantly this book clearly demonstrates alternatives to globalisation that exist and avoids merely theorising. This is not surprising given that many of the contributors are leading activist-intellectuals such as Maria Mies, Vandana Shiva and Helena Norberg-Hodge. This book is essential reading to both understand the process of globalisation and to learn more about some of the alternatives that are already in practice."
4,Great Text on Retention Systems and Shoring,"This is a wonderful text on shoring systems, written by a contractor's engineer with a wealth of experience on the subject. The text is clear, concise, and well-organized. It contains sections on many common shoring systems, from sheet piles to soil nails. It covers soils aspects, structural details, and construction methods.The book is best as a guide to the many shoring systems available, their advantages and drawbacks, and construction methods. For that, it is invaluable--there is no other text that measures up. It does provide sections on design, but these are a little light, and should be viewed as a primer, not an authoritative design reference."
1,Delta 50-446 DUMB Collector,"Without a doubt, the worst accessory that Delta has tried to push on woodworkers. The slit opening clogs easily and often no matter what material is being planed. Overpriced and underdesigned, it certainly does not live up to the quality that Delta has been known for in the past. I can only hope that the new owners, Black & Decker, will try to come up with a real accessory that works!"
3,"Great guide to the cultures, but not the lingos","This fat little book is the only cheap resource available to a number of obscure languages of the South Pacific.It basically covers the languages of Polynesia, including those of tiny Niue and Easter Island, plus Fiji and a minor language of New Caledonia.Unfortunately, the coverage given to each individual language is very, very limited, pretty much restricted to hints on pronunciation and a few essential wordlists like numbers, plus basic phrases like greetings.What fills up much of the book is lenghty and insightful descriptions of the local cultures instead, with great tips on etiquette.However I couldn't help feeling those should actually be in the relevant guidebooks, not in this phrasebook!Still, the info included is interesting and there is nothing better, so this book is worth buying - just set your expactations right."
5,good pot,totally satisfied with this hard to find pot-I wanted something I could cook small amounts of pasta as well steam veggies in. Pot has a reinforced bottom to help in heating and a basket with holes small enough not to loose pasta
5,Star Kick Soccer Trainer,"A great product and kept the boys 8 and 11, entertained for many hours. Eventually we were wishing we bought a couple more of them as the adults also ended up taking turns."
5,Loves it,My daughter just loves playing w this. The great thing about it is she can practice by herself in a small area. She is 6 and it even fits her waist just fine.
2,Better if the ball stayed put,"I bought this for my 10 year old son. He loved it - but the ball won't stay in the straps. The product has four velcro straps that you use to secure the ball. He uses a size 4 soccer ball and I have spent time carefully strapping the ball in, only to have it come loose as he practices with it. The concept is great, the belt worn around the waist is comfortable but the straps don't hold the ball well."
2,Adult woman behaving like a teenager,"Wow, here we have a woman in her mid twenty's who can't think or talk about anything else than her boyfriend, or finding one for that matter.If the scenario were changed so that Jackie (the main character of the book) were living with her parents, instead of her roommate Sam and her job as copy editor to be high school student this might have worked find in the ""young adult"" genre.However I think most mature adult woman want more than this rambling on about nothing else than boyfriends and are pretty bored reading 281 pages about Jackie's dating troubles.The same thing also happened with MONKEY BUSINESS, where almost 30 year old business school students are displayed more like freshmen college kids living in coed dorms and being on a food plan.Interestingly enough I just found out that the author now actually writes books in the ""young adult"" genre, and I think teenagers might find interest in it, good that she found her true calling!"
2,Don't leave me hanging!...,"Jackie has fun friends, a great job (in my opinion), and her dating life seems, well, normal if you're in your twenties.I enjoyed reading this book until I reached the ""non"" ending and I feel like I was robbed!... No ""real"" ending, no Epilogue with a happy ending??? It left me guessing and confused, knowing Jackie, this could end up to be so many different scenarios, who's to say that she'd come back and end up with Andrew, she's just apt to find a cowboy in Paris & never come back.Now I'll have to buy ""Fishbowl"" to see if this story continues---what a great marketing ploy."
4,Cute!,"This is a cute, fun, humorous book! I am around the same age of the main character, and could relate to most of the situations she ends up in."
4,Now THIS is a cute book,"I'm getting so sick of this single-something genre, but this book, as well as Fishbowl, is pretty good."
1,mind-numbing,Perhaps its not appropriate for me to be writing a review of this book being that i dumped it in the garbage before even reaching chapter 2. I just felt the need to vent my frustration. this book does not have an ounce of wit or creativity. i rolled my eyes through all 27 pages that i read.
3,It's okay is the best I can do...,"I almost bought another of the author's newer books before realizing that she had written several other earlier novels. After reading the reviews, I couldn't believe that I had missed out on such a well-known chick lit author... Well, after reading this book it became very clear why I've never heard of her and why I will not be buying anymore of her books, save something major happening. The main character was just obnoxious. I loved Bridget Jones, but that was a one time wonder - you can't keep recreating it and I find the idea that most women are so shallow and man obsessed offensive. This is a WAY light read - so light it's not worth bothering unless you like subjecting yourself to an essentially plot-less novel with unlikable, whiny, silly characters. If you want good American chick lit, its out there, and it isn't this..."
3,decent,"This book was cute, although it started off a little slower. It took me a while to get into the characters and really want to pick it up and continue reading. One I the story got a little more interesting, it moved along much better.Jackie is a single girl in Boston, after having been dumped for Thailand by her ex, who doesn't necessarily want to be in Boston. She moved there to follow her then boyfriend, Jeremy, but he deserted her and Boston right before the big move. Jackie finds a home for herself and a small circle of friends and begins to push herself back into the dating world. Every guy she meets seems like the perfect guy, until she begins to date him. Missing Jeremy and all the while falling for his friend, Andrew, she wishes herself a boyfriend so hard, she her chances at a great new experience.Good book."
5,Cracked me up,"I read this book on a ""sick day""- it was a very quick read. This book, taking place in my own city, was familiar to me and made me laugh out loud many times. Jackie and her friends reminded me of my own. Many of her insecurities and mistakes were all too familiar, but she was still able to wade through them to find what was best for her. It will be one of my favorite twenty-something-single-grrl books."
4,A great summer read!,This book is a wonderful summer read to sit out in the sun by the pool for hours. Simply said; it's a fun book.
2,Buy this used,"Definitely a beach read. I was bummed that I spent the money on it. If you are choosing a book club book, this isn't it. It is very short, predictable and you'll be done discussing it in about 10 minutes. While I agree that the dating stories were funny and relatable, I found the stream of concsious writing style a bit confusing. There were times when you had to reread pages because you couldn't tell if the character was speaking aloud or thinking.Also, a bit of a pet peeve, there were at least three places where incorrect grammar and words were used. The main character is a copy editor...guess the copy editor at Red Dress Ink didn't find the book interesting enough to catch the mistakes."
1,How did this get published?,"I'm sorry, but this is sooooo BAD! I couldn't get past the first two chapters. The characters go on and on and don't really say anything. Overall, just very immature, and downright boring. There is no real story here, just a bunch of scenes about shallow people drinking or obsessing over every little thing. After reading the first Red Dress Ink, See Jane Date, I was looking forward to this one, but save your money. (...)This is a wannabe, that just doesn't come close unfortunately."
1,What shallow 13 year old wrote this?,"I just finished reading a few harder reads, and received this as a gift. I thought some light chick-lit might just be a relaxing change of pace. I forced myself through it, but only painfully.It is written in an open style, but not adeptly, so that it comes off reading like something a pre-teen girl might write... The attitude and shallowness of Janie, the protaganist, only reinforces the whole idea.I found the book boring, and insulting to women in the negative stereotypes that it perpetuates.If you are the type who obsesses over marriage and wearing the right thing-- hey, this book might be up your alley. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and go pick up some other book to scratch that chick-lit itch."
3,gel mat wannabe,"i was expecting a bit more sponginess from the mat. it is adequate, but not quite what i was expecting."
4,A Great Start,"This is my 3rd router purchace and in general I am pleased with my choice. The Router it's self is great and the depth of cut adjustment system is the best I have ever seen and I have looked at every router I could find. The quick release clamp is perfect and the twin screw adjustment has almost no play(apx..004"") with the clamp loose. The fact that the router is supported by the adjustments even when mounted in the table is my favorite feature. Now what I do not like. The case is a joke, no bit storage, the bottom falls out when you open it, the engineers really dropped the ball here. The only other thing it needs is variable speed. This would be the perfect table router if it were either variable speed or at least a six speed!!"
2,Milwaukee 5615-21 router vibrates so bad it's dangerous.,I purchased this router a couple of months ago and attached it to a MLCS router plate so that I could use it in my table saw extension. I used it yesterday for the first time and was very disapointed in the amount of vibration this router has. It is so bad the leveling screws for the plate vibrated completely out and the guide pin that I use when using bits with bearings vibrated out (twice) and over into the spinning bit then shot off into my yard. I never could find the pin. Also in order to use the height adjustment through the base plate you have to remove one of the handles because the screw holding it in is too long. No big deal if you leave it in a router table but a pain if you take it out to use it by hand. This router has some neat features but I wouldn't recomend this router until they solve these problems. I have seen several other reviews about the excessive vibration.
1,Not woth it,I purchased this book with the hope that it will help me plan my destination wedding. It is not worth the money as it is not helpful with anything. Each resort has very basic information (even more basic than what you would find in a travel magazine) and the black and white pictures are not good quality at all. A horrible buy. I am returning it as we speak as it proved to be a huge disappointment.
2,Pass on this one,"It's not just algebra, there is some statistics also. For the most part not well layed out. I would pass on this one."
2,really not worth the investment,"By using the internet and TI resources, you will find enough TI-89 algebra tutorials and examples that make purchasing this book unnecessary. Save your money."
4,nicel;y written nicely drawn,"A good refurence on period homes. Each structure has a profile drawing, plans for two floors and is well described. Unfortunately it provides no images for attick which Victorians often used for bedrooms or funrooms as well as storage or basement which often contained house coal furnace and storage as well as other facilities.A good find for anyone interested in homes of this most interesting period. I just wish it were complete."
3,The small handheld book for travellers,"I took this book just to get a translate from my chatroom experiences on Denamark sites. This small book maybe the fine to travellers, because of hidding size and its phrases. Good for me that want to translate, but better to Danish tourist if knows speak a little English and want phrases at hotel or other points of tour. To learn Danish or English could be another issue or book."
5,Best 2.1 Speakers Available,These speakers rock. I only turn the volume about 1/8. It's amazingly loud. The subwoofer produces a lot of bass. And the satellites are crisp and clear. Just what THX certification means. The price just can't be beat. Grab em!
5,damn!!!!!!,"well i listened to morningrise and didnt think thre same thing that i did about my arms your hearse this cd just clicked i mean still life orchid and morning rise were good but not as good as this morning rise comes close i list my favorite and down my arms your hearse,morningrise,orchid,still life just buy this cd and youll see what i am talking about"
4,"solid, though not at the level of ""morningrise"" and ""orchid""","In my view, this album loses a little bit of the epic, poignant feel of ""Orchid"" and ""Morningrise,"" the production being a little muddier, the classical guitar being cut out a good deal, and the songs shorter. But the clean vocals are better than in the past."
3,"oh, peth.....................","the musical quality of the peice is beautifull and rare, i for one think that the guitarists expecially kik ALL too much a$$........but the coarse growling of mikaell just doesn't seem to mesh with the dark and ethereal feel.....it conflicts rather than contributing and that's really the only thing keeping me from buying the CD."
1,i had enough...,"the first thing i heard from akerfeldt was his vocals in Katatonia's brave murder day. i was impressed by his powerful yet desperate voice (the best growling vocals ever!!!), so when i discovered his band opeth, i bought orchid, morningrise and MAYH without hearing any of it... so this review (and the star)goes for those 3 works. in either of those works akerfeldt's voice has the magnificent, despair and greatness of brave murder day... so that was the beginning of the end.I don't care if opeth's music is complex and delivered by great musicians, for me sounds very artificial and bored... opeth reflects virtuosity but that's not enough, they lacks attitude and soul.When i have insomnia i put opeth in my cd player..."
4,Have a Listen,A friend of mine saw CJ give a show in NYC. He suggested that I give the cd a listen and I really enjoyed it. Two of my favorite songs are Go and Turning the Beat; the most catchy on the cd. This cd is really worth your time.
5,"With this book my money, can stay my money & pass it on","I am approx 64 years young. At this stage of life one gets concerned about what is next, what could happen, How to protect what ""we"" have built.... etc.This easy to read book has shown me in layperson's terms that I can protect my families money from a prolonged nursing home stay.This book has also shown me it is NOT too late to plan even if a family member is ALREADY in a nursing home. This book weeds thru all of the confusion and myths surrounding this over-whelming hard to talk about topic.After reading this book it is crystal clear as to why Beasley has been appointed Chair of the American Bar Association's Elder Law Committee. Wake up America buy it give it away as gifts.....Take these tools utilize them, you will be glad you did!!!"
3,BITS AND PIECES,"Bits and pieces of 34 (UK) oldies mixed together into one long 48 minute medley. Background music for a party, if anything. Okay for what it is. (Each track is under 2 minutes.)"
3,Poorly Published,"The content of the book and CD is fantastic, see the other reviews for more info. Unfortunately, the binding of the book is useless, especially when you try to set it on your pianos' music stand and have it stay open. The first time I used it, pages started coming loose like they were never attached. I guess I'll keep it instead of sending it back, because I like the material, but I'll have to fix it to use it (huge waste of practice time). Really should have been spiral bound - buyer beware."
1,Shame on you BERKLEE PRESS ...,a book this size is impossible to negotiate on the piano stand - I today split my copy and now the entire book has separated from the spine binding .. there is nothing more frustrating than spending quite a sum of money on such a wonderful resource and now have the text fall apart ... in this modern day of publishing why didnt you ever consider presenting a volume this size in a spiral bound edition ... I am simply left with a mess which is beyond repair ...
4,Worth getting,"I'm a long-time Chris Isaak fan, so I was very eager to get this. It's a good collection, but I thought it should have included more of his earlier work. The new songs that were included pale by comparison; I was particularly disappointed by ""Let's Have a Party."" Chris has done much better work; this one seems like he's just coasting. The collection did remind me just how good ""Speak of the Devil"" was though. The video collection makes this worth the price and essential for most fans."
2,Best of Chris Isaak,Very disappointed with this cd. I thought this guy was better than this. Songs are bland and unimaginitive. If this is the best I definitely won't purchase any more.
5,Simply awesome,"I heard Wicked Games on the radio and fell in love with it. Then I bought this CD and fell in love with every song. Now I need to find all the rest of this talented man's CDs. I never write reviewers for music, but I just had to add my five stars to the growing list."
5,Superb,Absolutely beautiful - His voice is superb - I am loving this album and I would highly recommend for anyone who likes to hear a voice range that's out of sight
4,I should have purchased the Model 5616,"This machine is a very good tool and it did a job I needed to get done with plastic material but it is very loud! It has an aircraft-carrier-catapult start and it takes a lot of time to spin down! I should have purchased the Model 5616 with variable speed and soft start. It's a moot point though because I think I'm getting a Porter Cable Model 893/5 multi-base router kit for Christmas.P.S.: It's amazing how little attention is being paid to cutting speeds for different materials. Tool makers (i.e., drills, routers) should take a hint from microwave ovens and their programmed cook times for different foods ... if you get the metaphor). We need tools with accurate electronic speed controls delivering constant power."
2,Not Queens,"The production values are good, but the story and situations are really hard to swallow. The film is mostly about the relationships of the women, not the gay sons. It was confusing having so many similar-aged women, stories swapping back & forth, constantly having to identify which mother belongs to which son. The situations were far too ridiculous, without being funny. Three of the women are having sex with people that are extremely unlikely to happen in real life. Just not believable. The gay guys are portrayed as weak shells.Clearly this film concentrates on the mothers and could easily have been about straight children getting married. As a gay man, I feel insulted that the writers think writing the children as gay instantly makes the situation something to be laughed at. There aren't many films that I find difficult to sit through to the end, but this was one of them.Note: This DVD is actually 4:3 letterbox (they couldn't be bothered to make it full anamorphic widescreen)."
5,I loved it,The documentary was great. It wasn't one sided. It had both the atheist and biblical view. It allow the viewer to draw the final conclusion. I personally believe it was God's hand that protected Israel. God Bless Israel!
4,Documentary of value,"This movie/DVD provides an interesting documentary of some significant events that took place during the period concerning Israel, and therefore the entire world. Some miracles were described and every miracle of God is worthy of publicity. However, I didn't find the movie quite as good as others described it, I didn't find the portrayal of the miracles was very well done. However I would recommend the DVD to anyone interested in the things of God, but only partly for the miracles."
4,quick and easy bug spray,This is a really good product that has been out for a couple of years but is getting harder to find. The wipes are so easy to use with children and does the work without DEET. It is just as effective on my family as the DEET products and doesn't smell bad.
5,Love the show,"I have all the seasons and watched it more than once. Great show, interesting story line, very good acting. Definitely recommend it."
2,Horrible left 3/analog button,"Unlees they fixed this problem the reviewer above(Gregory C. Dibartolome) is crazy. Like the other reviewer stated about FPS games the left 3 (the click down button on the analog) only works in the center, or may also work up or down, but moving from one to the other cancels out the function, which makes moving in some games a frustrating nightmare. Particuarly in FPS and games like Mech Assualt. It basically renders the controller useless. I almost didn't buy it, but the reviewer above stated it works great. Not... Other than that, if you don't need this controller to operate the way Microsoft intended, or if you don't need to use the left 3 button it's a solid, well built controller. I'm sure Logitech has addresed the problem, but unfortunately the old ones are still out there, and the one I bought on here is defective."
5,The dog LOVES this toy!,"My brother and sister in law has a Golden Doodle, that has one of these that he loves. Well our puppy needed a toy, and got one of these as a gift. he just goes nuts over the thing, tossing it around the kitchen to get the treats out of it for hours on end. Great way to beat the rainy day boredoms for the dog!"
3,Archaeological Insights into the Custer Battle,This book would be helpful for research but it is too technical for the lay reader.
3,Yet Another Version of an Unanswerable Question,"I had hoped this would be the FINAL word on the battle, however, the author seems more intrested in confirming his preconcieved notion of how the battle developed. It may be correct. It may not. I just see too many ""ifs"" and ""it looks like"" to be considered anymore the ""ultimate"" conculsion than any other work. Fun to read, but the 122 years that have passed means it will never be fully answered."
4,Great Deal,"When my filter arrived it was in a plastic bag instead of the normal package, I did not mind this since it made it easier to open. You could tell it was new and it fit my vacuum. Also I got it for cheaper here, on the Dirt Devil website you have to pay $21.39."
5,excellent price,I prefer buying this online. To go to the store and hope they have it in stock is just a pain. The price at the store is more than I would pay online plus shipping. This is a wonderful product. I will continue buying it from Amazon. Thank you. Sherrie Siemons
5,Married with Children 2nd Season,I have to agree with most of the other people out there who have wrote reviews. Married with Children is a classic sitcom the same as Andy Griffith or I Love Lucy.... I am anxious to collect all of the seasons as they are released. I just don't understand why it is taking so much time for them to be released. I prefer the episodes with Jefferson instead of Steve but I would rank them all with 5 stars.
5,Carpet Fresh,This Carpet fresh is the best. You spray it on and it dries up quickly. Smells wonderful. You can't find it at all the stores. When I saw you could order itfrom Amazon I was so glad to find it. I didn't have to run all over tryingto get me a couple of cans. Now I know where to come when I need more.
3,The Ethics of Management,The delivery was good but I did not need this book after all. The instructor was more at fault giving me a printed paper with this order information on it.
4,Not as good as Apple's charger but it still works,"I don't like it as much as the Apple charge but it still does the basic job... It charges. It doesn't seem to charge as fast and it didn't plug in as firmly after a lot of use, but it didn't break like other cheap chargers I've purchased."
4,Excellent writer & great series!,"I really enjoy this author. I read her trilogy 'Greenbriar Queen' and looked for more. I read this book and enjoyed the characters and situations. The author creates a beautiful engrossing world which drew me in. It left me wanting more. I did find the second book, it's called 'The Giant of Inishkerry' and I found it in Ireland - published in 1992. I don't believe it was published in the US. The third book is called Emperor of Earth Above published by Headline. I wish this author was still writing."
5,Excellent History of Black Women in Dallas,"I had the pleasure of purchasing this book while visiting the Black Museum in Dallas during the month of August 2004. I was delighted to read about many women I'd always heard about while growing up in the city of Dallas more than 60 years ago. The pictures are great and the information was quite enlightening. Many people live and die without knowing that Black people have made positive contributions to the city's culture and the lives of it's people. My purchase today is a gift to my mother who also found the book ""very exciting"". It was wonderful to look through the book with her as she was reminded of her early years in Dallas, noting places that no longer exists, and recognizing faces and recalling memories. (Dorothy Foster/Oceanside, CA) Thanks."
5,Great Adventure / Self-Discovery Novel,"This is a great adventure novel. ""Owen's,"" journey around the world in a life & death struggle for survival to find the meaning of life is filled with incredible courage, passion, & hope for mankind. It will stand the test of time."
1,Mentirosos! Very inaccurate.,"The few good aspects of this book are completely overshadowed by the false and frustrating information that fills the gaps. Just a few of the many inaccuracies we found:-The book says money can be exchanged easily in banks. Of the many banks we went to and asked they all said that it is ""very difficult"" to exchange money in banks. (some do however).-Prices for sleeping and eating were way off!! Restaurants that were one fork ended up being the most expensive (and in most cases had the worst food for the price). Some restaurants listed were not even there.-At least one ""typical dish"" called Rondon that was listed in the book was not known by any locals.-Maps were inaccurate. Addresses were wrong and locations on the maps were usually on the wrong streets.-Bus information-There are no direct buses from Salento to Medellin.We used the book for three weeks around Colombia. It was helpful, but I expected much more from a book published in 2009."
5,I LOVE mine - SMALL,"Very happy w/ my Sam 4100 also. (2years - used every day) If paper jam using the manual paper feed on the front was suggested to tickle the reset mechanism. In 2 years maybe 3 paper jams.The production would seem to be winding down. Can't find a new one for a friend yet. I tried to filter google product results (minus ""refurb"") that he would get a full service life new one. Don't know about Vista compatable or mac. I LOVE mine - SMALL, quiet, good ocr, adequate software."

2,Subs suck,"The satellites have fairly decent sound, but at super high volumes (more than you'll probably listen to normally) they get a bit sloppyThe real problem with this set up is the sub. TOO much! I have the sub knob turned down to the lowest setting and I still have to use the EQ in winamp to get rid of the obnoxious boomy bass sound. I'm returning these and getting another setup with a better quality sub."
2,Flawed; defective,"I bought this based on reviews. The first one came dead on arrival. Amazon took it back no problem. I have the second one now and the left speaker goes in and out. I'm too lazy to send it back. Besides, I threw away the original packaging."
5,Great Price for Food,"As with any fish food product, if you find something that works, use it. I am using the bulk size container for the plethora of tanks in my aquatic laboratory... great price for bulk food that works."
4,Eddie Bauer - Surprising Quality,"As the owner of several American made multitools, I was somewhat skeptical when I received the Eddie Bauer as a gift. On closer inspection, I must say that the fit, finish, and quality is first rate. I don't believe that the strength is equal to, say, a comparable Leatherman, but then again for non-professional use it's more than adequate.I especially like the integral hex bit driver and scissors (always a nice option). All tools lock similarly to the old Leatherman system (move an implement to the 90 degree position to unlock the implement in use). The attractive well-made belt pouch houses the tool and bit accessories.All in all it's a good value, and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have the dough to go for a pricier make."
4,Works like a charm,I bought this receiver and installed it in a movie room for my mother and it works good. It has been in for about 6 months and no problems at all.The remote worked the dvd and satalite and even beleive it or not a vcr.would recomend yamaha receivers to anyone. I have a simular model at my house works perfect.
1,Parents BEWARE!,This magazine lures in young readers by putting familiar admired celebrities on the cover. In a recent article they discuss kissing. They also address girls kissing girls on page 81 of the feb/march 2012 issue.That is NOT appropriate for this age group and clearly this magazine has an agenda.I encourage parents looking for a nice magazine to consider Discovery Girls:Discovery Girls (1-year)instead of GL/girls life.
3,"It's ok, but not the best","Ok. I wouldn't buy this magazine for girls ages 7-12. It's not appropriate for this age group although it says it is. I had a subscription to this mag in the good ol 2003. The articles had a lot of good advice and was the age group it claimed to be back then. I turned thirteen this year and just read the Oct/Nov issue. It wasn't good. Last year's Dec/Jan issue had a How to Get a Boyfriend article and I was shocked. The writer was Jodi Bryson who writes most of the celebrity and fashion aricles. Either she doesn't know what the age group for GL is, or she's not aiming for 7-12 year old girls. This zine is not what it used to be. If you have a 7-12 daughter, DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE. I'm pretty sure that a 10 year old doesn't want to learn how to kiss a boy. . ."
1,13+...atleast,"Girls Life- The ProblemsGL used to be a very great. After a couple of years most of these Magazine's go down hill, but I was truly suprised at GL. There quizzes are sorta stupid and there are not any interesting articles. I personally despise Emma Roberts, and thought they wrote a poor article on her. There isn't a decent magazine ment for 10-14. American Girl is only ment to 8-10 no older. GL isn't ment for anyone younger then 13. I am a 12 yrs old, and I am shocked at GL. I am very mature for my age. Girls Life is just like Cosmo Girl, Tiger Bop, Lucky, Seventeen, you name it. Not ONE magazine has an article ment for REAL GIRLS, WHO ARE NOT BOY CRAZY. For now I recomend you don't read GL. It's totally disgusting for anyone under 12. I recomend Kraze."
4,girls life,I like girls life.it has articals about fun stuff serious stuff and happy stuff and just plain dumb stuff. mot of the things r really cool and always have hekpful articals.i really like it.Everything is great about it but i think they focas on fasion tooo much when must of the clothing u have to buy speical or can never find so it is just a big waste of paper that no one even looks at twice.But everthing else really is great for your everyday life(i guess)
1,Too Much About Boys,"I read multiple reviews online and figured I finally found a magazine for my 13 year that wasn't full of exposure to grown up issues like boyfriends, or BF as the magazine refers to them in numerous articles. I was excited about giving her an avenue to get some ideas about fashion and light make up applications but when I read the Dec-Jan issue-I cancel fast enough. It's sad because there are some good articles I would love her to read but everyother page made reference to boys; the magazine makes it OK for 13 year old girls to have a BF, discuss how to get a guy to like you, etc. It's a real shame some parents think a 13 yr old can handle all of this mess when they should be focusing on school and becoming responsible adult. Not kissing & telling, or more for that matter."
1,clothesed-minded,"Out of curiosity I wanted to see what was available for our youth.I was compelled to say how dissapointed I am at the segregated racist world we live in.Each cover shows a white, blond girl. They're pretty and covered in make-up. What is it this magazine is trying to convey?The United States is a multi-cultural country of beautiful girls from various ethnicities.Let us foster that beautiful unity in diversity & continue to inculcate this into our girls that beauty on the inside certainly makes one even more beautiful on the outside."
1,Ummm...,"Okay...when I saw the title of this magazine, I thought, ""Sweet! a magazine that deals with REAL LIFE issues!"" well...here, it is NOT the case. First of all, an article on how to be an amazing kisser?! Excuse me? If this is a magazine geared for girls around 11-15, why should they even put that in a GIRL'S LIFE magazine? All the girls my age that I know have never had a real kiss in their life. No, I don't have stupid or unpopular friends (not that it really matters), I have NORMAL friends. And second...the GL Cuties? What the heck is that about? Every single boy I see in this magazine is just about the stupidest, geekiest guy I have ever seen in my life. Overall, don't waste your money on this piece of mindless wannabe crap. I reccomend it for wanna-be, mindless 10-12 year olds who have no life ;-)(Oh, and to top it off, i'm in 8th, I'm reading Allure and Teen People with no problem!)"
5,Dream Wanderer is a Heartwarming Story about the Glory of Life,"Dream Wanderer is a heartwarming story about the glory of life. Dream Wanderer has mind-boggling, unique animals, creatures, swamps, deserts, volcanoes, plants, dinosaurs, castles, robots, a robot city, daring adventures, and very distinct, vivid landscapes as Joe Blake tries to escape the dream world that he is trapped in. There is more information listed under author, Boyd Thomas London, on AuthorsDen, which is linked here to Amazon."
5,Wonderful source for self discovery,My cousin bought me this deck and book and since then I have used it in many ways and for many reasons. I feel a real connection to this deck. It can tell me more about myself and others than any set of tarot I have worked with. This is a wonderful way to learn about yourself. It is a great way for self improvement and even my great friend who reads tarot at fairs has started coming to me in times of need because he feels it is more accurate. Wonderful book! Wonderfully written!
5,cards that will guide you through life,"For years this deck of cards has been my personal teacher, I take them with me wherever I go. Especially in times of great need, when you feel lost or hurt, the advice from the cards can turn your life around. I find that they are best understood after reading Lynn V. Andrews' books, as the information on the cards is quite condense. Beautiful pictures on the back !"
3,A Little Disappointing,"Yes, being addicted to the ""Dark"" series means waiting with baited breath for the next book and maybe getting my hopes up too high. The book is still a good read but has a blatently different ""feel"" to it than the other books. Maybe when the next book comes out it will gel the story together."
5,Legendary !!,Dark Legend was by far one of the best books in the series so far. Feehan has told Gabriel's story so well. His realization of Francesca as his lifemate was powerful. The book held my attention and I read it in one night. I can hardly wait for Lucien's story to enfold !! I would highly recommend this series for anyone who loves this type of book.
5,Can she not write any faster,"I cannot get enough of this author and this series, as soon as you read one novel, you immediately want more. As usual this novel is sexy, (steamy) a great love story, suspenseful and has a great suprise ending. I look forward eagerly to which story Ms. Feehan will reveal to us next."
5,Kept me reading,"I really enjoied this book. Christine Feehan has me captured by this wonderful series. In each book the central drama is developed and present us with new and charming new characters. Everything is conected and she keeps us wanting more and eager to the next book. I am a new fan of the Dark Series, I haven`t read all the issued books. Dark Legend is the last I read and I can`t wait till Dark Guardian arives so I can read it no stop."
4,Really good,"This bbok was really good. I loved to see the passion between the couple and the love of the brothers. It also introduced Skyler, which was one of my favorite characters. Although, the dialogues and phrasing can be a little repetitive."
4,great function and button layout,"the extreme pro is a great overall controller.with the all the buttons on the controller base,makes for less use of keyboard usage while in game play.i myself use this controller for fighter ace flight sim.the down side of this stick would be the over sensitve rudder control.in game settings will not overcome the issue of the rudder pot.i use this stick heavily and they only last about 6 months for me.then its time for a new one.ive tried all of the microsoft sticks and siatek,but this is my over all favorite."
4,Great,"Easy to use joystick. I don't like the fact that you have to have the logitech software running when using this joystick though. It sucks up some memory, although not much at all."
4,Nice Joystick,"I bought this to use with Microsoft's Flight Simulator X Deluxe, and it works great. Not force feedback, but has a real-feel to it."
3,Programming,"When I click on the Joystick, settings and equipment, the entire page does not show on my computer. The column for setting the roll and pitch does not show anymore. I am disappointed that there were not complete instructions for programming the Joystick for the Simulator. I am new to using a computer so need more instructions for the settings."
2,Basic joystick,"This is a basic joystick, it has worked fine so far (just a few uses), but I cannot recommend it. If I was a die-hard flight simulator player I would not be very happy with the quality vs. price, and would definitely go higher-end."
1,needs improvement,when i got it it it worked without a problem then about 3 days later the whole thing basicly shut down and some of the time it works fine. i have no clue if its the product or the company
5,Its exactly what it says it is.,"Its still working 5 years later. It is solid and reliable. Good value as well, I use it for FSX as rudder control because it has a twisty handle."
4,FSX CONTROLLER with VISTA,"Wore out the first one flying about 20,000 miles in about 1 1/2 yrs. From Flight Sim 98 to WWII Combat Flt Sim, it worked beautifully. Very satisfied with the control and bought another new one to fly the Flt Sim X. For the price, its a good buy and satisfies all my needs."
3,Sticking spots,"For the price I should not gripe. But, I expected better from Logitech. The joystick sticks at times and I have to add extra effort to move it. When it releases the airplane ""lurches"". If you can afford a better one then you should not buy this one."
3,LE 3D Pro,"Im new at using joysticks.It works well for the game i play. im still learning how to set it all up the way i want.Buttons are hard to set up ,i think."
4,Logitech Extreeme 3D Pro Joystick,"My Microsoft Sidewinder had so much deadband that it was unuseable after about 15 years. Time for a new one. I bought the Logitech because of the high rating. It works fine but is really stiff. Hopefully, it will wear in with use. I also needed the USB connector as my new computer did not come with a gameport."
4,good joystick,"I'm happy I bought it. Controls are quite soft, nice, responsive, and has a sturdy base. I've been using it to play my MS FS 2004. I'm yet to use it fully for my Merc Warrior. Though I'm disappointed that the throttle lever doesn't work for car racing games I've used it for."
2,Breaks down easily,"I've bought more expensive joysticks before, and i always came back to this one just because i liked the layout of it. The problem is though, i've gone through two of these because they tend to wear out pretty easily.I dont really use joysticks all THAT much, maybe i'd use one for 2-3 hours a week, but i seem to have to buy a new one every year. Eventually, especially with these logitech ones they get to a point one day where they get so far out of calibration that it's literally impossible to calibrate them back in.I guess in the future i'm going to just have to buy some high end joystick just so i dont have to keep buying new ones."
5,Awesome!,It works great on my macbook pro. I didn't have to install anything. I plugged it into my USB port and then the game i was playing even had presets for this joystick.
1,Good but Not Good,"Ive owned 4 of these Joy Sticks, they are good for a short while but have a problem after extensive use, and become useless after a while. Not recomended for Extensive continious use. The joy stick loosens and will not operate properly in FSX or combast Flight sim or online games. If you only play periodicaly then this is a good resonably priced joy stick. Ive never had one last more than 9 months from purchase."
4,Valuable resource,"An excellent book for someone with previous sewing experience, especially hand sewing. (You don't need a machine to make these garments, in fact, it's better to do it by hand.) I very much appreciated the background on Japanese sewing, however, the stitches are not as clearly illustrated as they could be, and would probably be very difficult to understand for a beginning sewer. As for the other illustrations, arm yourself with patience and re-read the explanations several times through.Overall I'm happy with this book after looking everywhere for traditional Japanese kimono patterns. I was able to successfully complete a kurotomesode (formal black kimono) thanks to it."
5,The ONE to read!,"I have read countless books and spent hours online researching ""gifted"" children topics. This book's format really put it all into perspective for me. I suddenly ""got"" my sons and have looked and dealt with them in a different way and as a result, has eased a lot of frustration in our family."
5,A fun book to look through,"This is a good book with lots of beautiful pictures. It's not something I want to sit down and read through, I'd rather flip through it and look for interesting things. The facts on the sides of the pages are the most fun to read."
2,HALLIWELL MAKES OUR DAY. AND NIGHTS. THIS DOES NOT.,"Just because it boasts the ""American Film Institute"" name (and just because Clint Eastwood penned the intro) doesn't mean this book is the ultimate reference tool it claims it is. There are too many omissions (no career info on Julie Harris?) and the type is much, much too small to be read or taken seriously. The photos are pedestrian (nothing new, really) and the book is much too heavy to make for ""easy"" reading. Stick to Halliwell."
3,"Full, but is it complete?","This compendium is absolutely crammed with all kinds of information about, literally, every aspect of film, no matter how obscure. Moreover, the pictures it contains are marvelous and evocative>Why, the, only 3 stars?Because I have serious doubts about its completeness! Quantity is NOT necessarily an indicator of quality!One example from early on: Within the first few pages we are treated to both a narrative and ""time line"" history of the early development of film, beginning in 1830.Yet there is no mention, whatsoever, here or anywhere else, of Willian Friese-Green!Who is he? If you ask the British, he is THE inventor of modern motion pictures!Superceeding even Edison's claim.Opinions vary as to HOW important he was to the process, but there can be no doubt that he WAS important! (See:-if you can find it-""The Magic Box"" [1951].If the book doesn't even include him, who/what else has been omitted?Anyway, get the book for what is HAS, but don't consider it definitive!"
4,Good Wine Key,"So far this is just what I wanted - sleek, simple, with the beer popper on the end - now let's see how long it lasts, durability is always the test of a good wine key. My only complaint is that the serrated knife leaves the foil looking sloppy sometimes."
4,Beautiful carrying case,It is a beautiful carrying case. Holds the binoculars well. I just wish that there was a separate compartment for carrying a cleaning cloth or maps.
4,It was a little great,"On a class trip to the Shelley Museum, the kids meet Dr. Victor and his assistant, Frank. Liza has just read a book about FRANKENSTEIN and she thinks Frank is Frankenstein's monster."
1,Humor book,"I love hearing Jeannie's humor but this book wasn't what I expected. So, I donated it to the library and hopefully someone will enjoy it."
1,Unintentionally Humorous,"The singers are tolerable but not first rate. Sometimes they perform their roles with some feeling, but this is usually in the style of the original cast. The original cast album serves as the basis of this album. The singers are just dubbed over the original, while playing to a kareoke style track. The instrumentation does not match the original, synthetic instruments are used, and piano is very prominent. You can frequently hear the original cast member singing underneath the new singer. For example in 'Springtime' when the orchestra is added back in after the Judy Garland segment you can hear Bart singing his lines. Also the singers botch a few lines: ""What did Delaware say to his troops as he crossed the Delaware."" This album is purely for comical value or for completists. Thank goodness its at a bargin price."
5,"great insight into the US Establishment, a must have","when referecing this book, read also the book FOUNDATIONS: THEIR POWER AND INFLUENCE by rene wormser and Anthony Sutton's WALLSTREET AND THE RISE OF HITLER, they as a whole give the overall expose on the American Establishment, their machiavellian activities and the eminence grise. - A REAL MUST FOR THE AMERICAN AND WASP LIBERTARIANS."
4,Important book,"Very important book to understand globalism and the new transnational forms of government, its origins, its rational, its implementation.Everyone who wishes to grasp how the transnational post-democratic mind works and perceives the world should read this book. Quigley is very honest as he state the new regimen as inevitable and already in fast implementation and although very apologetic of it, he is displeased by the fact that all those changes are been made disingenously and in secret.This book is the bible of globalism, read it if you want to understand it, and to understand how the world works nowadays...Quigley wrote it mostly because he thought people should have the option to choose and participate in all those changes openly...and not merely acept them passively and deceptively."
1,1940's zanies,"This includeds Nasty Quacks, Hair-Raising Hare, The Bashful Buzzard, Daffy Doddles, Little Orphan Airedale, Baby Bottleneck and Book Revue."
1,not worth getting,This book asks too many questions and becomes very tedious to fill out. Obviously written by someone who is not a grandparent.
3,Decent...,I wish it came with a roller of some sort to make it easier to apply it. It worked well though and stuck to the furniture without leaving any residue and protected it well during the move.
3,Iran,"Found this book very interesting because the author of book simply presented facts, and did not express his own view.The story was sad because Mr. HOVEYDA did not have a chance for a proper trial."
3,Under the Hammer,notation said book was is fair to good condition - which it was and that was okay but the book had pages missing. It was at the beginning so important facts about the investment scheme were missing. I was very disappointed since I paid more than expected to get this book.
3,Average read,"The first story was O.K. Someone who is a sports fan/player might like it better than I did. The second story was totally unbelievable. No-one would allow a minor to raise their brothers after the parent died, and they never explained how she or her mother could afford paying medical, funeral, mortgage, food, clothing, etc. for a growing family for 10 years which irritated me no end."
1,Too boring to finish,"I *always* finish a book once I start it... but not this one. I got about a third of the way through it and gave up after realizing that I didn't know or care what I had just read over the last couple of pages. Nothing ever happened, it was just people talking (or reading) about their personal philosophies of life and 'utopia'. Don't bother."
3,Great if you are just starting in paper crafting,"This book is great if you are just starting to dabble in paper crafting, but if you have been either stamping or scrapping for a long time this book doesn't have much to offer. I've been stamping for ten years or more and just transitioned to scrapbooking, I was hoping this book could offer more than just techniques but that's really all it is. Along with pages that contributors have sent in but there are no page layouts or explanations about how to create the pages pictured. So I wouldn't exactly call it an encyclopedia of scrapbooking, more of a technique encyclopedia would be more accurate. Coupled with another book like Imagine: Fun, Fabulous Layouts for Every Scrapbooker, would be a better bet for getting a more well rounded idea of what you can do."
5,Scrapbook,This is a great book and has alot of great ideas. I would defiantely purchase this book again.
5,No longer in print!,"I always try to find a copy of this book on Amazon as it is out-of-print. I always give it in conjunction with a copy of ""Goodnight Moon"" as a new baby gift."
5,Rollins is on a Roll,"Having read Rollins other books, with their alternate realities, I was eager to read this one. I was not disappointed. The plot is straight forward and the action fast-paced. The characters are standard without too much depth to them but enjoyable.The use of disparate bits of info, like rongorongo, a real undecipherable language found in Micronesia, the Devel Sea, a region of the pacific similar to the Bermuda Triangle and the mysterious megalithic buildings scattered throughout Micronesia and the legend of MU is interesting. Rollins weaves them together into an very enjoyable, entertaining book.But why does every modern hero have to be a ex-Seal? Why not Marine Recon or Ranger, both of whom have beat Seals in Armed Forces competition. But, since I am former Marine Recon, I'm biased.Anyway, get the book."
4,Another intriqueing one from Mr. Rollins,"Fast paced as usual. I'm glad I found this author. Probably recommended by Amazon. Decent character developement; they soon become acquaintances if not friends. Very interesting science in this one too. I will, sometime, refer to the books he references on the real science behind the story."
3,Read his other books first,"Well, This book is pretty farfetched. It is on the one one hand why I read it, following my pattern of ""serious"" and ""fun"". On the otherhand it had so many unbelievable plot lines and so much license was taken that the usual suspension of belief that accompanies pulp fiction was not even possible. I have read Rollin's two other books and like them both, but I think he strained himself on this one, couldnt come up with appropriate plot lines and hence cheated in writing this book. I can't say I would really reccomend this book, but if you enjoy summer thriller read's check out his other two."
2,Deep Fathom,"I am a huge fan of James Rollins, however I couldn't get into this book after reading about a third of the book I just put it down and went on to the next book. This is not the norm for me and Mr. Rollins' books. I've loved them all, and look forward to the next."
4,"Not my favorite of his books, but still a fun read!","While ancient mysteries, lost continents and an ocean setting usually combine to create thrillers that I can't put down - this unfortunately, was a bit hokier than the other books that I have read by James Rollins. Usually he does weave in an extraordinary element, but with ties to make it at least somewhat plausible. The ending, in particular, of this novel, completely fell apart for me. It completely fell outside the realm of possibility and just was too ridiculous in the way he tied everything together.However, the characters and overall premise are solidly constructed. It still is a fast and fun read - just not an example of Rollins' finest work. Also, this one includes more of a military and political slant that is less pronounced in his other adventure-thrillers."
2,The desired effect was not exactly what I expected,"I wanted to see if there was a better alterative than using a Sto-fen Omnibounce on my SB-600 Speedlight to get soft light (and to this day, nothing as compact and effective goes anywhere close to my sto-fen omnibounce) so I decided to try out the Photoflex XTCII Softbox. Immediately after setting up the thing on my speedlight, I was already expecting the worse. I had to boost up my speedlight a couple of notches stronger and I got some really bad looking shots. Thank goodness I shot in RAW because what turned out to be ""okay"" soft light from this getup, turned out to give me some really ugly lighting resulting in some really bad shots. I returned the thing immediately. If you wanna go compact but need a softbox, invest in a $12+ sto-fen omnibounce or just make one with a plastic milk carton. You can't go wrong."
5,Inspiring and moving.,"This is a book that tells the stories of women -- some famous, some you've never heard of -- who, at some point in their lives found themselves in situations that terrified them. For some, it was the emotional terror of doing something they did not believe they could do; for some, confronting an abusive relationship; for some, physically accomplishing something that seemed impossibly arduous. Hearing their stories makes you weep. Their courage is often so quiet -- no big fanfare, no publicity, no one else even knows about it. But, sharing those life-changing moments with them changes your own life. Many of their stories inspired me to believe in myself, and reminded me of the everyday love and compassion and commitment that makes humans heroic. I keep this book by my desk, and pick it up whenever I need a burst of encouragement."
4,Works,I replaced my inner 38 tooth Suntour GPX chainring with this part which was causing some slippage with a new chain. Works great now.
3,Nice to have,"Good compilation, nice to have, not a must have. Not disappointed with this book, just not a rave for me."
3,Not worth the price.,The story was okay but it lacked depth. It really couldn't keep my interest. It seemed that it was more about trying to be sexy than actually telling a story.
1,Pitiful,"Hands down the worst book I have ever read. As others have reviewed, full of gossip, obsessed with homosexual innuendo, patheic spelling and grammatical errors. Waste of time, not to mention money"
1,Cavet emptor,Caveat emptor. Know what you are buying. Make certain you read the return policy prior to ordering anything from this seller. ALL SALES FINAL.I do not recommend this seller.
1,It's about time!,"The menacing look on the Feld dude's face (gracing the cover of this masterwork) is an indication of the musical ferocity contained within. Quite simply, the man is a genious. He really sticks it to Hollywood on this one folks, it's all their fault you know! You know it's bad when MC Hammer of all people has to tell you to get over yourself. But I'm getting way off track folks, the music, the music. Words cannot describe it. Eargasm is the only one that springs to mind."
1,The TRUTH!,"I've heard Corey sing one of these songs on the surreal life tv show and thought he was kidding but he's taking this seriously. Wow! His distorted view of his ""singing"" and ""song writing"" ability is just about as bad as his ""acting."" There hasn't been a singer/song writer this bad since Eddie Murphy put out a music CD! How does a record company afford to invest money in making this CD when you know it's destined to sell about 75 copies?"
1,worst ICP joker card,"This is by far the 4th best (soon to be the 5th with the release of their next album) ICP Joker's Card. You have to be desperate for some rap to buy this album. It is trmendously terrible. The beats are extremely SSAAAAADDDDDDDD!!!! However, all other Joker's Cards are brilliant. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE."
4,I C FXCKING P's IN DA HOUSE,"ok, this album isnt' icps greatest, and if you buy it first, yer not gonna like icp that much. if you are new to them either buy the jeckel bros or milenko, once you get hooked on those albums, then you find yourslef loving each and every icp song ever made, then you buy this one. its awesome for peope who love it ICP!!!!"
4,Joanna Lee - A TV Pioneer,"Joanna Lee's book was a pleasure to read. A real trooper in the ups and downs of her interesting life - the book is also an inspiration to the women ""underdogs"" of the world. She never gave up on her dreams of writing, producing, and directing. A straightforward, amusing, and touching book. She is listed on another website as one of ""Ed Wood's Bimbos."" She was anything but. A clever and intelligent woman. She had courage, grace, and plenty of nerve. Her book takes you back to a time when America was very different and the nostalgia (both good and bad) is part of American History. Joanna Lee's book is a keeper and worth passing on to future generations."
2,Maybe it's my car....,"...but this was too big to use it properly. Another thing is the plastic on the feet allow the bar to slide, the feet actually slide inside the plastic."
1,Bad Discs Also!,"I also got bad discs! The 4th Symphony is a disaster. I have tried playing it on several machines with no luck.Fortunately, I purchased a copy of the 4th before they released the complete cycle. I made a CD-R from it and the 5th Symphony.Nevertheless, a definite bummer. I really like these performances."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Ridley, the author of the Soledad O'Rourke books, gives us his take on our favorite bunch of powerful posthumans.The Unites States government is still not happy with The Authority taking over, and tries to do something about it. Supposedly a normal human, they slip an agent into contact with The Authority on a pretext.Right, that trick never works, at least not with this bunch. Fool them once, quite likely you die not too long afterward."
1,Worthless! A total waste of time and money!,"There are not words to describe how absolutely worthless this book is. It explores the outermost boundaries of suckiness. It is not a collection of sex secrets but instead an asinine mish-mash of idiotic comments, most not even relating to sex. The author should have his writing/compiling priviledges taken away. There are plenty of good sex guides out there, buy one of those and do not waste your time with this one."
3,Maybe you could...,Yes this book is pretty much a bunch of random quotes from guys on what they like... I picked it up and had my boyfriend sit down and circle everything he agreed with and write comments if he thought it was warranted then I went and did the same. It was a fun way for us to explore each other and find out things we might not have thought about saying.just an idea...
4,Great Brush,I've been looking for a brush like this forever... this is the best one I've found yet. The bristles are the perfect length & don't snag my hair. The handle is very comfortable. The only thing that prevents this brush from earning 5 stars is that my hair does get snagged where the handle is joined to the brush head.
3,Good for Fine Hair...,"For $20, these Rubis aren't bad. For me, they are excellent at grabbing fine hairs but they can not grab a thicker hair at all. I have a lot of trouble using them for eyebrows. If you're looking to tweeze thin hair, these will work well for you. I will continue to use them for that purpose but I have to find a different tweezer for thicker hairs."
4,Delightful sense of humor,"Rossi has a sense of humor that he shares in his book. I laughed outloud. For a dry toast title, it was not too hard to read. By the way, if you are in a hurry, read chapter 13 first."
2,Load and Noisy,"I bought this fan because my PS3 ran hot, and now that it is attached to the PS3, in fit alittle akward. The fan worked great for about 2 weeks, but now it makes a very load sound whenever it starts up and last for a few mins sometimes. Im not sure what the sound means, maybe its about to go bad, but it has been happening for the 2 weeks, so ill see how long it lasts."
3,Nyko Intercooler,"Its a good product, quite a good idea. The noise factor of it is the least of my worries. I have only issue with this intercooler. I noticed that on days which were not very hot(I live in the Caribbean)the biggest fan would have moisture on it. It seem to be soo cool that it was getting wet. It is still a good product all the same. Works well for me. Although i think it should fit just as shown in the pic. Mine fits slightly off because of how it is designed. No biggy. Minor design flaw."
1,"Poor build quality, disturbing sputtering fan sound","I owned this product for almost 24 hours. In that time, it sputtered and coughed like an asthmatic trucker. After investigating the source of the sound, it seemed that the fans themselves were the source of the sound, and not from vibration or other sources. I double, triple, and quad checked the fit to make sure, but it was definitely the fans. For $29.99, I would have hoped that they could have done a better job. They do get a plus for the overall look of it, which is sleek, and the nice packaging, but a pig in a dress is still a pig. Stay away from this product and find some other way to keep your PS3 cool in your entertainment center."
2,Flaws,"Sure the main purpose of this is to cool your PS3, yet that is all the benefit to it.Flaws: poor electrical wiring1. It becomes the master switch for the PS3 instead of a switch to turn off the fans (leaving your PS3 on standby also leaves fan on)2. Terrible variable resistor (it does allow you to increase the speed of the fans, but you cannot turn the variable resistor all the way down to turn it off)3. Am assuming it is a series connection, which explains all these flaws. However, if it were in parallel there would be more content costumers.Thank You for considering my review =)"
2,..... dots....dots...,"So there I was thinking to myself WOW i'm going to get this super awesome cooling system for my PS3.. WRONG they send me what i thought was just the back 1/2 of the cooling system which turned out to be a completely differnet one. If I wanted a crappy cooling system I would have orderd the crappy one. I can't be bothered to send it back so its hooked up to my ps3 right now, does a decent job though.."
3,really noisy,this cooler makes A LOT of noise...but I deal with it since it keeps the PS3 from over heating....also it was difficult to instal. (I'm not a video game nerd...bought it as a suprise gift for my hubby)
1,Very sleek piece of garbage,"AVOIDThis fan is insanely loud, only makes a noticeable difference on the highest setting, borrows power from the consoles power supply which forces you to physically turn it off when the console goes into standby. Its like pulling the power cord out every time you go into standby. I hate this product and so will you. Stay away from it."
2,doesn't fit sony ps3 40 gb,"ok so this thing does not fit at all on a 40 gig ps3 and they are aware of this and there still selling these.they should atleast print something on the box about it not fitting on a 40 gb system but they dont.but i still have it on my ps3 but thats because its not on straight and the little clips broke off even though it wasn't fault because in the directions it says to push until you hear a click or something like that.well anyway this does work pretty well as far as removing hot air from the system,thats why i gave it a 2 star.but it doesn't fit right on my 40gig system! :( wonder if they'll send me a redesigned replacement even though the little clips broke off?"
1,Don't Buy!!!,"A week after I bought this thing one of the small fans in the back started rubbing and making a loud buzzing noise on top of how loud the thing is already. You cant just turn on your playstation with your controller, you have to use the switch. It is a waste of money, I let my little son run around with it and throw it, I need to get my moneys worth somehow, so what better way than a childrens toy"
1,Better buy a headset,"If by any chance you commit (like me) the really big mistake to buy this product, you may better start thinking about buying a headset that let you hear your games. This device it is simply noisy and the worst thing about it is that you can turn off the cooling fans, besides, I write to SCEA about this product and they told me that is not recommended by Sony."
1,After 3 weeks it's dead... AND IT WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY,"I bought this thing and the first two things I noticed were:-Its WAY too loud.-I can't leave the PS3 in standby mode.Then after 3 weeks I hear this HORRENDOUS noise coming from the PS3. The large fan on the cooler was making noise like a bearing was going out.Suffice to say, don't waste your money.EDIT - Talked to Sony Repair about these things based on what I had heard at my local Gamestop. DO NOT USE THIS DEVICE.. The use of it will void your warranty on your PS3. They apparently draw too much current and cause the power connectors in the PS3 to burn up."
3,looks good,"i guess it takes your big ps 3 an makes it bigger the fan is loud but it you play games loud then its ok you can leave your game on, but its easy to take off for non long gaming moments but over all close but no cigar."
1,But is it art?,"First, I have to admit, I'm not a big manga fan. Though I love some anime onscreen and dig the comics, this is not what I had in mind.Found out about Lone Wolf through a parody in Usagi Yojimbo and if that's enough to make me a wannabe just stop reading, cause I really hated this little book. The artwork was so gritty and coarse that you could barely tell what was happening and then everyone was dead. Wasn't difficult, wasn't artistic, just some blurs and then everyone is dead again. Plot? Near as I can tell its a guy and his kid who kill everyone they meet. That's it.Takes a lot to make me not finish a book, especially a comic. I made it maybe 15 pages into this one."
4,"Good enough, slow delivery","Remember these are very inexpensive, they work, but I find them a little awkward to shot (loading on my pinkie and pointing finger takes a little practice. The construction is okay, but i doubt it will last for more than a few months. Having said that it was darn inexpensive, so it is well worth the money.Not five stars because of the slow shipping, bough this and the screaming monkey for an office ""White Elephant"" gift exchange, but they showed up the day of the event and i only received them upon returning home from work."
5,Great Product,"QFlash products are superb. A bit expensive no doubt but if you are a working pro or higher end amateur/part-timer, Quantum is the gold standard for portable lights. This softbox is a terrific diffuser and light softener. Stongly recommend it over the on-flash diffuser options (the one that comes with the flash unit and/or the dome diffuser).Quantum now has a larger octabox which I would like much more owing to its 24"" size. That said, I haven't ponied up the $300 needed to buy one of these. Perhaps an enterprising firm out there will create a competing product that is reasonably priced--I mean, let's face it, the cost of manufacturing Quantum's softboxes is likely in the $20-30 range. The markup, therefore, seems excessive."
4,Very good album,"Lets not get carried away. This album is very good and I like it. However, it is not their best. Their second album is by far their best album. This album though has some really good songs. Staind is a good band. Their not ground breaking but their still solid. I wouldn't mind seeing them live in concert."
1,Same sh*t different name,"I read some of the reviews about this album just to get a feel for what people thought. And to the people who said ""what happened you guys used to rock"" or something similar to that I will tell you what happened. They got exposed for the complete frauds they really are. They made their sound alittle heavier in the beginning to draw in everybody, and then came out of the dark.They don't have alot of talent so they were forced to put out a pop record in order to still be played on trl and corporate radio. I don't care how you much you tune down your guitar, you can't hid the fact that you have nothing but a bunch of rock ballad crapola on this record. They will be playing at a county fair near you soon............."
3,Pretty much a dead band now,"Staind may as well give it up. This is there 2nd failure in a row. I hate to bash this band, but their prime is obviously over. Becoming a family man has clearly impaired Aaron's song writing writing and influence on the band's sound. Sure there is some good tracks here, but in a whole this album does not deliver at all. I will admit this music is better then their 2003 disappointment, 14 Shades of Grey, but its still not enough to keep me interested. Where is the anger? The depression? Its gone. Sure its here to some degree, but not as powerful or moving as the first 3 albums. Back in 99, when I listened to Dysfunction, I never would have guessed here in 2005 what Staind sounded like. Staind just doesn't have what i'm looking for anymore. I hope Cold's new CD isn't a let down too.."
3,TOO MANY SLOW SONGS,"YUP,JUST ANOTHER SLOW ALBUM BY STAIND.I LIKE THE OLD SCHOOL STAIND MUCH BETTER.THE ONLY SONG'S I LIKE ON HERE ARE ""FALLING""AND""RIGHT HERE"".AFTER THERE 2ND ALBUM BREAKTHE CYCLE,I LOST THEM.THEY STARTED WRITTENAND PLAYIN' TOO MANY SLOW SONG'S.IT'S NICETO HAVE A SLOW SONG HERE AND THERE BUT I MEANARE YOU KIDDING ME?WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOODOLD HEAVY RIFFS AND FAST SONG'S WE USE TO HEAR?[...]!!I WANT THE OLD STAIND BACK!!"
3,funny female philosophy,"This 12-Step Program is from another time of frivolous innocence where ""Go-get'em!"" was the rallying whoop & where women wore their egos like tiaras - lighting the way with humor & a prod(or nod) to reality.Cathryn Michon, the mistressmind of the whole Grrl Genius phenomenon & an award-winning stand-up comic herself takes us through her dozen steps, showing how to become a true Grrl Genius. Spelling notwithstanding! The Girl Genius Club played to sold-out audiences in Hollywood & featured some of today's top comediennes including Janeane Garofalo, Ellen Degeneres, Margaret Cho & Kathy Griffin.The Grrl Genius Guide to Life is a fluent feast of fast, funny, female philosophies which left me rather relaxed, once I came back up for air!"
3,The Code,Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors as Bandera but this movie was a disappointment. Luckily I bought it used and only paid $5.85 so I got my monies worth.
3,Good Movie not great,"It it worth buying for less than $10. It'll entertain you for the time it is being played. Note, do not buy the DVD version. I accidentally bought the DVD version first and never watched it. Purchased the Blu-Ray and then realized I had already bought the DVD version. The DVD version I have was at such a low bit-rate, I could have swore it was a gray market ripoff (it was a ""used"" DVD with a total DVD image size of 4 GB with the main video being around 2 GB). The Blu-Ray version looks a thousand folds better (I couldn't even watch the DVD version due to the low bit rate of the main video."
5,worth watching more than once,i rarely buy movies but was glad that i bought this one. i think that it is a good one to buy because you will want to watch it several times. Very intense. Not one you will sleep through.
4,Very good easy to read reference,"To be a good NT Administrator you must have a good reference for the registry. This is a good one. Packed with info, you'll learn something just about every page. Warning-Don't try to read it cover to cover.Kent H. MCSE, CNE"
5,Love it!!!!!!!,"This is such a handy way to store laundry,the best I've ever seen. Do not hesitate for a minute to buy this product. Well made and a great idea!"
1,Corn Syrup Contaminated,"Sad that another product has to use inferior by-products such as corn syrup. Hardly natural at all. One should learn about the process to make corn syrup. Once they do they won't touch soda, candy and other aduterated products."
1,This sandale is the most worst thing I have bought!,"This sandale is really hard to wear. When I open the outside of the package, the terrible smell shocked me. I really sure it cannot be ruber, it smells like a ruined chemical factory.When I wear it, the bottom is so hard that you feel like you are walking on a iron board.When I wear it for couple of hours, my feet smells like from a dead body.If you want a decayed feet, I strongly recommand you to buy this sandale."
4,Rainbow sandals,"I had a pair of these in the early 80's and they lasted a long time. This pair was very uncomfortable without some fixing done by myself. I had to line the nylon strap with moleskin for the first couple weeks. Without this, I wore holes in my skin on the top of my foot, after a few weeks the feet toughened enough that they felt very good and comfortable. I would recommend these cause once they are worn in, they feel great. Do the moleskin thing like I did and you will be content with these ""slaps."""
1,The author is so good yet this book is very bad,"Norman's writing is usually entertaining and informative. This book was hastily written. It is very short on useful insight or information. If you want to learn about design, there is nothing here."
4,informative; revealing,"It is hard to take issue with a man who is so deadly with pen and paper as Mr. Michener. His views are so compelling I find it difficult to counter them when in disagreement. Although basically liberal in output, he is by no means ""knee-jerk"" nor ""tax and spend""; indeed I would surmise to say that he probably voted for as many Republicans in his lifetime as he did Democrats. This book is not a typical Michener work; instead it is a simplistic yet well thought out essay on the problems we all face and ignore. Perhaps his failing health affected his writing; or perhaps his aim was to keep it concise for the masses; either way I found myself wanting more. However, all in all an informative work that should be read. Ideal for introspective teens who realize there is a world around them. Should be read with ""The World is my Home"" to gain a better understanding of his views in later life. Again, highly recommended for insightful teens and young adults."
1,Sports in Society: Issues and controversies with online learningoov,"The book was identified as ""used"". The book was in poor condition, very used, wrinkled cover, writing in margins and hi-lighting.This was disappointing since the book cost $8.99 with shipping."
3,JV from Flushing,"To inherit his father's legacy Sam Baranov needs a bride, a woman to keep house and bear children. He doesn't expect love; in fact, he doesn't believe in such a poetic notion. Which leaves him hard-pressed to explain why one glance from the new schoolteacher sets his pulse racing, or why her smile has him offering to teach the students woodworking. Laura Templeton has traveled to Alaska to make a fresh start, not to find a husband. But after meeting Sam, matrimony occupies all her thoughts. Until Laura knows that in a land which boasts rainbows at midnight, they have discovered a love powerful enough to wash away the mistakes of the past, a love to light their future together."
3,The Book's Obsolete....,"This book has one distinction: It is responsible for wiping out every advantage travelers ever had with the travel/hospitality industry. The first few people who used the tips probably prospered, but with widespread use, the airlines and hotel chains wised up and closed every loophole. It's a lot like that useless ""Free Money"" book you see sold on late night TV. If everyone knows about it, nobody benefits. E-books are the way to go for advice books. They're always more current. The information in books like this is two years old by the time it's printed."
1,Just Horrendous,"Apparently some books sneak through the editorial process untouched and eventually emerge as literary abominations, as is the case here. ""The Travel Detective"" is greatly in need of major revision or just plain euthanasia. Presented in a whimsical and ""organizational structure be damned"" style, this book buries whatever useful information it has in a maze of humorless humor (often in the form of pointless stories) and illogical logic. It basically boils down to an unending stream of adjacent thoughts, facts and rhetorical questions. Greenberg, along with his editor, should be embarrassed by this attempt at bookwriting and should stick to writing articles for magazines. I HIGHLY recommend leaving this book alone."
1,Don't,"If you have never traveled before now or taken close to zero plane rides, then this book is for you. Regardless, the content contain within could easily be edited into a magazine article."
1,Such a disappointment,"I concur with the many reviewers who see this book as lacking any redeeming value to any traveler. (However, it is certainly a tribute to Mr. Greenberg's escapades within the travel industry). I cannot believe that he passes himself off as trying to gain ""the best service"" by the way he treats those who work for the travel industry. Certainly with the new regulations in the travel industry, Mr. Greenberg's will likely end up in jail.If you buy this book-I have some swampland for sell."
1,Do not bother.,"Most of the ""tips"" in Mr. Greenberg's ""book"" can be obtained by talking to any frequent traveler yourself. Simply, the ""book"" does not deliver what it says it will. He talks more about the history of cruise ships than how to get a great deal on a cruise. He does not discuss how to get great service, he tells you how to make yourself a nusance with the people in the hospitality industry. Mr. Greenberg's negativity toward travel in general is also apparent. If you want to read a book on all the bad things about the travel industry, this book is for you. If you want to read a book about how to circumvent the ups and downs of the travel indsutry, you need to read another book."
1,Disappointed,"The full title of this book sounds great, but the book fails to deliver. Repetitive, boring, outdated and poorly organized and edited. Look online for up to date travel tips."
4,Worth it!,"This was written pre 9/11, so some of his kvetching about security measures and carry-on limits must be read with a grain of salt, but this is a great primer for anyone who travels regularly. I learned a great deal."
2,$ for common sense plus a few tidbits of good information,"I thought I'd get more out of this book than I actually did. Some of the suggestions seem like common sense to me--watch the airline arrival times to see if your departing plane is coming in on time for example. Greenberg also sounds a little too snide and know-it-all for my taste. This may be just a personal taste 'thing'.There is some good detail (good 'hidden' seats for example) but it seems to me that a lot of this information is already available or is easy to figure out on one's own. Try reading 'Frommer's Budget Travel Mag' regularly, for example."
3,Vacuum Gauge from Amazon,"This vacuum guage is easy to install and works very well and looks good. However, the included hose and ""T"" adapter are totally worthless. The hose collapes while the ""T"" adapter broke in two places with no stress on it - possibly could not withstand the engine bay heat. Buy the meter and throw away the included hose and adapter. Go to your local parts store and buy a decent hose and adapter for about $7."
3,AN OK READ.,"Took me alittle time to get into this book. Normally I can read a historic romance novel over a weekend but I was having trouble keeping my mind on this one. I found it to be drawn out and couldn't hold my focus. I don't think this was a ""freebie"" but I know I didn't spend much to read it and for that I am thankful. Now, some of you might enjoy it, so to each their own."
3,Pretty Good,"I liked it, but I almost got tired of waiting for the ""good part"". I persevered; it was anticlimactic. I was interested to see if the brother was guilty so I read on. Overall, it was a good read, but not great."
3,"the idea is great, but who's in charge of quality control???","When I read the online reviews for this product I felt tremendously appreciative of this whole concept. I was excited to get started with my own daughter.However, I was disappointed when I recieved this book and discovered that the 2nd clue from the 2nd hunt was missing as well as all the pages for hunts 3 through 8! So I paid for 50 treasure hunts but I only received 44. Not to mention that we really won't be able to utilize it until she's at the reading level to do hunt 9 since it's a leap from Hunt 1 to Hunt 9. I wonder has anybody else received a brand new book with pages missing?"
4,Sony CFDS01 CD Radio,"Not a bad box for the price. Not a lot of volume, but sound quality is good for a small room. Could have bought it at Sears for slightly less money."
4,Must listen from start to finish,"I bought this CD after seeing the band live at Crossing Border in Amsterdam. Their music is very elegant and vulnerable. Sometimes it sounds a bit too much like Radiohead, although they very much have a style of their own. I definitely like it, and it grows on you every time you listen to it. The only problem with the album is that you really have to listen to it from start to finish. The songs fluently blend into each other, perfectly matching the atmosphere of the preceding song. I find it hard to single out songs to rip to my computer, which is the normal way that I listen to music."
1,"Good idea, cheap materials","I bought this tripod because my regular one takes too much room in my backpack which in long trips is a problem. It's a great design, the head is very stable, more than some regular size tripods I have used. The problem is the cheap materias they use in the legs' nuts, they are cheap plastic and after the first two times I used it with the legs fully extended one of them didn't work anymore. Now is a dangerous unestable tripod for my camera if I fully extend the legs."
4,Golf Is The Best,Anybody who likes to play golf should get this Cd as you can listen to a lot of great golf songs. Bogey Bob is a great as it talks about a guy making bogies. Also another song is A Golf Lesson. All I have to say is if you play golf and like it very much than you should get this Cd. All of the the songs are great to listen to while heading out to play your round of golf.
5,The perfect journal for the traveling writer,"As a writer, I'm always on the lookout for little journals that can fit in my purses and book bags without wearing down my shoulder. Most of the little journals I find are spiral-bound, or they're wide-ruled, or they're just ugly.I am quite happy with this little addition. The leather is soft to the touch and the binding is strong (and the paper is not bound to the cover, so the inside pages bend without bending the outside spine). The pages are ivory, and while I would have prefered white, they are both thick yet flexible (i.e., they're not so thick that they crack, yet not so thin that every pen leaks through to the other side). A ribbon marker to keep my place would be the only addition to make this beyond perfect. I love the color (a deep red), and the heart isn't too girlie-cutsey.It arrived shrink-wrapped and in new condition. I'm definitely buying from them again when I fill this one up."
5,Very Nice,I bought this journal for a special purpose and when I got it I was very happy with the outcome. The cover feels soft and the paper is nice to write on. I was very glad I bought this.
4,book,"my son really likes the time warp trio books, we have many of them & all are great fun to read!"
5,Great Music,"In lieu of beig a great show there are some great music as well, does anyone know the name of the song at the end of the last 1st season episode?? Awesome song...."
1,Rescue Me - The Complete First Season,"I was really looking forward to watch these series, but after few first episodes in the first season I lost interest, its too strange for me, and I am somehow dissappointed in the quality of the pictures and they don't have subtitles not even closed captions.... :(I understand english, but I miss subtitle/closed caption option."
5,Rescue Me... the hottest show there is,"What Miami Vice was in the 80's, Rescue Me is for this decade. Rescue Me is the hottest TV show for this decade. There is nothing else that even compares to it in regards to drama, humor, and especially reaslism. Each character has tremedous depth, the cinematography is cutting edge, and the music will stay with you for a long time. I still have never seen it on TV, only on DVD. It will get ya hooked!"
5,great show I love it,"As A firefighter my self I enjoy watching a show that dosent pull any punches and shows it how it is. The men and women in the fire services are by no means perfect we all have problems just like everybody else. Its refreshing to see a show that addresses common problems in everyday life with a sense of humor. Of course not everything you see in the show is real-life stuff, but its makes for good TV. This show has actually brought many of us in the fire service closer together. When the new season premeries we all gather around the TV in the day room at the station and laugh and carry on. So for that I highly recommend it, what other show on TV these days has the power to bring a station full of grown men together from all walks of life and get them laughing and talking about real life problems. Only Rescue ME well maybe the L word. HA HA"
1,Uggh!,"Horrible. Silly. Nasty sexist, racist and all around bigotted humor masquerading as hardnosed television. Lesbian fascination should begin and end with Howard Stern. Anti-religious drivel is quite played out nowadays also."
1,Broke the Third Time I Used It,The blender does not chop up the ice. The ice just bounces off the blades. The third time I used it the motor stopped working.
1,Biggest Waste,"We bought this thinking it would be a lot of fun on our camping trip. Boy were we wrong! The first night it did not work at all. The second night I tried pushing the tip of the plug in a couple times and realized it was stuck, so after a little while it started to move a bit, and then it worked. The next problem came becuase the bottom of the base says you have to do one minute on and one minute off but the instruction booklet says something completely different. Either way after 15 minutes of cyclying on and off I had nothing but smaller peices of ice and a broken blender. Don't waste your 21.99 unless you just want to use the pitcher as an oversized shaker as we did!"
3,a good album but not great one,i bought three albums of this singer based on the gorgeous reviews. i would say they are good but really not worth those high praise. they are rather ordinary stuff.
4,Great price..quick shipping!,I received my cassette a lot quicker than I expected. It was in great shape.
2,OK READ,"I will make this short and to the point. This is not as hot as ther other ones has been. All 4 of these lady are top seller and on my top 10 list, but this is not far close to the great work I have seen from them. I must say I wasn't impressed with any of there stories."
5,the most beuatiful gloss,"This lip gloss is so pretty. I am so in love with them.I have been using them since they came out a few years ago and I have been buying them ever since. They are very shiny and sparkly and gives you a pretty glossy look. Everyone wants to know what lipgloss im wearing when I have it on, it really stands out. They have about seven different colors and I hope they will add more because I can't get enough."
5,After the Empire : The Breakdown of the American Order,"While I do not agree with everything Todd has put forward in the book, the main point he makes; that American culture is re-drawing its boundaries of social inclusiveness and how this is happening, rings true. Speaking as a knowledgable outsider; a Frenchman, economist and demographer, with long experience of English and American cultures, his observations shed light on why someone like myself, who came of age in the 60s, feels that we no longer live in the Country I grew up in. This is a very helpful read for an American who wonders ""what is going on here?""."
2,Meh,"It's okay. I'd probably get more from finding a wall to kick the ball to. If you have no wall anywhere because you live in the middle of desert, then get this."
4,The lady swings!,"Certainly Britain's equivalent of Diana Krall, Martin's voice is efforless, smoky when needed, and powerful when appropriate. This collection, spanning the entirety of her eclectic musical career, manages to squeeze in both haunting brilliance (e.g. ""Riverman"") and emotional ballads that effortlessly surpass classics in their grace. However, I like her best when she lets it rip in style - ""Partners in Crime"" is simply infectious!A perfect introduction to those new to Claire Martin. Although not all of her best moments are on the CD, it gives a good overall picture of her vocal talent. She certainly knows how to swing."
1,nice if it worked,"crucial online help useless,claimed product number wasnt their part,1 gig of two not ""seen""....64 bit mem sent for 32 bit os... since anything was better than 512 I just kept it....hassle to return. slot still shows empty...they fought me the whole way though I was pleasant and patient......I think it was just a bad day for me.---heed...Crucial fought me the whole way,even though I was patient and pleasant.ie its your fault. oh well..not gonna sweat it..gonna buy a voodoo anyways...so ill just give it free to one of my customers. and use someone else next time.I have installed over 1000 kits from other ""lame brand"" ie chineese with nary a problem and quick change out when I got a dead stick....which happens more often than people realize.things happen .. its how you fix the problem not whether a problem occurs."
5,Love this Song,How can you not love this song? I has one of the catchiest tunes that came out this summer...I feel sorry for the people that just can't get into the mood of summer sun.
4,"Nice collection, but very short","This small book contains (too few) quotations from more or less famous films. They are divided into categories such as Foreplay, Marriage, Propositions or Stolen Hearts. I think it is a great book, and very usefull if you need a quote to put on a card or in a letter (especially love letters come to mind), or whatever you do with quotations. The question is, however, do you want to pay ( ) for a rather small book? (It also makes a great gift, precisely because it is not a big tome but a small paperback.)"
1,It adds a lot of height,"Odds are, if you're getting these heel cups you're trying to prevent/correct overpronation and other foot problems, and you've already been advised to NOT wear heels. The higher the heel, the more the problems. I got these hoping I could wear them in some boots with about a 1.5"" heel... and when I put these inserts in it feels like I'm walking on a 3"" heel. They're comfortable for what they are, but I'm not sure I'm going to keep them because I'm not supposed to be walking on heels that high! (And if I were I'd want a really killer shoe to at least get some sartorial bang for my pain.)"
3,not very durable,One of the heel cups was shipped misshapened (packaging bent). It took quite a bit of manipulating and wear to get it reformed. Not as durable as should be for the price. Why so expensive?
2,Golden Age of Looney Tunes Vol. 9: Hooray for Hollywood,"I watched ""Daffy Duck in Hollywood"", ""Hollywood Steps Out"", ""Hollywood Daffy"", ""What's Cookin', Doc?"" and ""Slick Hare"". Those cartoons, few of them on Looney Tunes Vol. 2 DVD, are on this video."
4,"A thorough collection of symbols, signs, and signets...","This book has over 200 pages of various symbols, ranging from simple drawings to intricate designs. They are arranged in historical order, begin with various gods and end with hobo signs. Each chapter is preceded with a list of references (the signs are identified by number) and the symbols included are grouped like so:Symbolic Gods & Deities; Astronomy & Astrology; Alchemy; Magic & Mystic; Church Religion; Heraldry; Monsters & Imaginary Figures; Japanese Crests; Marks & Signets; Watermarks; Printers Marks; Cattle Brands; and Hobo Signs.There are over 1350 illustrations contained in this book, and all are crisply printed in black and white. Each section has a short blurb in front of it, but not an extensive history. This book would appeal to history lovers, graphic designers, and other symbol geeks. And for the price, it's worth buying."
3,Frabill Min-O-Life Aerator 1424 (Purchased on 03/25/2010),"I purchased two Frabill Min-O-Life Aerator 1424 (Purchased on 03/25/2010) but one of frabill having problem with noise instead of silence .

4,Works,"I use this to brush my teeth with. I have found that not only is it good for bacteria, but gives me whiter teeth."
2,Hard to follow instructions...,"I could see where the author wanted to go, and it's a good concept, but the ironic thing is that the first lesson of Level 3 is, ""How to follow instructions"". I'm 37 years old with 4 college degrees, and I had to re-read the instructions several times over to figure out what they wanted.We didn't start this curriculum from the beginning and dove into Level 3, so Maybe if you start with Level 1 it Might help?Also, it seemed that the instructions were a bit... sarcastic? Or, maybe it seemed that the author was ""talking down"" to the student. For example: [Not a direct quote, because I swapped it on PaperBackSwap.com...] ""Now, if you didn't get that, go back and re-read the last paragraph 3 times till you do."""
4,Breaks it Down,"My 3rd grade son has struggled with writing, so this book is a godsend. It breaks it down incrementally in a way that has (so far) kept him from balking. The length given for the assignments and the sassy - kid focused - language make him willing and able to do these on his own. As a college-level composition teacher, I find this book to be brilliant."
1,don't get it,"I don't get what is supposed to be so great about this series. My daughter did level 3 and four before we decided to call it quits. We both found it a pain to follow the instruction and methodology. Level four consisted of assignment after assignment doing things like making lists of items in rooms and describing where everything is located, such as the south wall, north wall and so on. We both found them very boring. It was very difficult also to see where all this list making and organizing of information, which didn't really feel like it fit us or would be our style of doing things, was headed. There was no feeling of having really learned something valuable or sense of accomplishment on having finished the books. We have switched to Saxon Grammar and Writing and are liking it much better. My daughter has written some essays that I have been proud of in just the first few weeks."
4,"Little ""gold nuggets"" make a excellent read!","Yes, this is a peak into the mind of Ginsberg. It may be more of a peak into his persona at the time the work was written, whether poet,bluesman, hippie,scholar, political activist etc. What makes it worthwhile are little nuggets found throughout the work which probably were unnoticed by most of us when originally published. I do wish this book had a complete table of contents (pagination) rather than just page numbers listed for the major sections. But, maybe it nudges us to search ""on our own."""
5,Unbelievably well made,"After being a VB fan for years...this wallet is not only very beautiful, but extremely durable. The convenience of the pockets, nook and crannies to be extraordinary."
4,The Hobo Lauren has everything!,I have been looking for a wallet that holds everything. I can easily organize my items and prioritize within my purse. It is so helpful as a mom because I get easily distracted. My favorite is being able to just open the center and use my license and choice cards. Outstanding clutch that you can also use alone!
2,cheap leather cheap wallet,"even though this wallet has an okay design and thefunctionality of this wallet is acceptable thiswallet has a huge major design flaw: it is madefrom cheap materials.even though hobo is supposed to some sort of companythat supposedly specializes in high quality leatherand hardware i found that this was not the case withthis hobo lauren wallet. the metal started to peeloff, the leather has already started to shed, andone of the inner pockets has ripped a little bit,i've only had it for 3 weeks!i am going to try to figure out how i can send thisone back...."
3,A Bit Old Fashioned,"This book is not the most accessible of grammar tomes -- it's sort of old-fashioned, academic and dense in its language, and not laid out in a particularly clear way. It lacks bullet points and sub-headings and leaves you to find information in the solid blocks of paragraphs in numbered headings."
4,A *must* read for anyone doing business online,"StrikingItRich.com could very well be classified as a ""motivational book for online marketers""! With all of the get rich quick schemes and scams, it is indeed refreshing to find real stories, about real people, and real successes in the online world.There is ample variety to demonstrate that there are still multiple opportunities for building a solid revenue stream from an online business. Each of the profiled companies were doing a very respectable amount of business online. Even so, the unspoken message, the one that I believe online businesses will find most valuable, is that if *these* companies can make this kind of an impact on their bottom line, then there is hope for the smaller merchant or businessperson that is not looking for a 7 figure revenue generator, but would be quite content with a 5 or 6 figure addition to the bottom line.I fully intend to give this book to every one of my online clients. I eagerly await Part II."
2,A very boring book,"I have heard of about 10 or 15 of the companies mention on the book cover, but I learn nothing new. It's just a lot of boring interviews with internet start-ups. And there's nothing in there that you can't find by surfing on the net."
1,These are stories about struggling websites,"Most of these sites are rather homespun efforts and hardly suitable for inclusion in a book titled 'Striking it Rich.com"" There is no indepth analysis or commentary on the marketing strategms. I was rather let down by the book."
1,This guy is a joke.,"I find it disturbing that people consider this narcissistic repetitive user of long words a ""philosopher."" His undulations to the scintillation of the deification of civilization made me nauseous. I feel bad for the great authors whose names he dropped, but worse for those who are forced to endure his tours."
1,cliche...,To cut it short..a waste of time especially author's time. Hardly anything You didn't know (girls like to play with dolls and boys don't like to play with dolls) a lot of stating the obvious..boring boring and once again boring. Not reccomended at all.
2,Unsatisfactory,"Perhaps I have been unlucky and acquired a CD not typical of the Chandos production quality but my copy is dreadful. The second movement of the B flat Sextet sounds like La Folia being played in the deep end of a swimming pool.Not good at all. The unda maris affects aside, the performers seem to do well with what, by Brahms's standards, is rather indifferent material more in the vein of Louis Spohr than the mature Johannes Brahms."
4,Fieldmaster,"Price on this is very good. I have seen it go for more than double.Yea, it isn't a $300 tripod but so what.I did get a scare when mine arrived and I could not separate the 'split' center column. It finally came apart but I had to use a couple pairs of vise-grips and of course that trashed the column. It looked like the inner threaded insert had gotten more thread cement than intended at the factory.I emailed sunpak and did not get a reply, so I called them and left a voice mail for 'Gloria'. She called me back a few hours later and after I told her what was going on she took my name and address and said she would send me a new center column. About 4 days later it arrived in the mail and it works perfect. Very happy with customer service."
4,Lightweight treker pod,"This is a light weight hikers pod, doesn't work well with a heavy slr or heavy large camera, but it is the rave for the small lightweight digital cameras....... it's all the pod you need for a small lightweight videocam or digicam. Works great."
1,"not worth it, even if you think it's a bargain","i bought this tripod because i thought the price was right and it had the features i was looking for. when it arrived, i was not only unhappy with the quality and flimsiness, but the screw to mount the camera immediately fell into the body of the tripod to be lost and gone forever.. so i returned this tripod and will continue to search until i find one worth buying that i know will last longer than five minutes out of the box."
2,Sanyo 2500 Ma Batteries,Have had three failures out of two 4 packs. The 2700's ok as are the enloops. Will not buy these anymore. Cannot refresh with Maha C9000 charger.
2,"Interesting premise, dull and wrongheaded execution.","Just a few comments: The author failed to make his characters compelling or believable, even in a fantasy setting such as the one featured in this novel. Meaningless, overly cute dialoge abounds. Ridiculous vampires, one of which, as written, is so astonishingly boorish that finishing the novel might be something of a chore (the other two vampires are merely boring), take up too much of the novel's time. Quizzically, the author tries to force a comparison between the two male vampires and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.I do not understand the jacket comments praising this novel. Most claim that Lord-Wolff has done the miraculous in reinventing angels, much like Anne Rice did for vampires. But there are only four angels in the book, one of which isn't seen after the first chapter. Seriously, if one third of all the angels in heaven fell to earth, as the novel implies, one would think the writer would present a few more of them."
5,A real collector's item!,"This edition, printed in Hungary in 1989, is a suede hardcover, with a cardboard slipcase. It contains 30 plates selected by Eva Boros (author of the postscript) and photographed (in sepia tone) by Alfred Schiller."
3,Worthwhile for the version of Summa alone.,"If this is your first stopping-off point listening to Part, you might find it more rewarding to begin with some of his more recent recordings or the better known works such as Tabula Rasa or Kanon Pokajanen.However, this CD is certainly worth trying if only for the recording of Summa, (track 5) which is undoubtedly the best version that I have found to date amongst his work."
1,Blender does not run at constant speed,"I had problems with this blender ever since I got it. The blade never run at a constant speed at any spead level like the demo HP3 did. I attempted to get my money back a month after I bought the blender, but the company would not honor its warranty. I continued to use it and after 6 months the blade seized up liquifying an apple and it leaked oil or grease from the blade bearing into the mix."
3,"Tripod for very light cameras, just 1kg weight limit.","this tripod for its price is great, everything is plastic excepts for the ball.the ballhead is a no-way for me, even if you put a standard DSLR with a standard lens, the ballhead just keeps slipping, bear in mind, the maximum weight is only 2.2lbs or 1kg. some lenses are already 1kg."
2,Should Have Purchased the Duplexer,"The Ricoh CL3500N that I purchased didn't have the optional duplexing unit. I figured that would be fine, as for the few jobs I have that need to be duplex, I could do it manually. WRONG. I've spent all afternoon fighting with the print drivers to get it to collate and manually duplex. Apparently I need to add more memory to get the collating working right (it works for Word but not PDF), and just give up on manually duplexing (it just jams when I run the paper through the second time. HIGHLY frustrating. Otherwise it prints well (although it does seem to guzzle toner...) I think I'm going back to HPs."
4,2001UT,"As indicated in the product description, this plate fits perfectly a SunPack 2001UT tripod. The only thing I don't like about it is that the ""ring"" in the back of the plate (the piece you turn to fix it to your camera/scope) is very loose, with the consequence that sometimes it is a bit of a pain to fix the plate on the tripod (because the ring will dangle underneath and won't allow you do fix the plate easily). But perhaps my plate was slightly defective. The original plate I got with the tripod doesn't have this problem."
3,"Excellent content, poor editorial efforts by Ace Books.","I have enjoyed Isaac Asimov's works for 28 years and was delighted when Roger MacBride took up the challenge of the Caliban series. I've only read part one of Utopia so far and find the content is riveting robot reading as always. However, I have found well over 20 gramatical and typographical errors so far. Take page 48, third paragraph; ""The govenrment seems to moving with unseemly haste."" A be is missing. And another on page 185 second paragraph; ""Wouldn't 'Good morning' would be a trifle more accurate."" Too many woulds. The book reads like it was written by a robot experiencing a first law conflict disorder."
3,The Curious Case of the Campus Corpse,"This isn't a top notch 70's horror flick, really, it's more a mystery than anything. During a hazing incident one young man (Charlie Martin Smith) appears to have died. What takes place then is an elaborate cover-up to protect the guy that was supposedly responsible for the death, which becomes more and more complicated as time goes by, until the guy can no longer deal with this ruse.This is a rather talky movie, and it takes a very long time to get to the payoff, which is a rather strange twist ending which I didn't see coming. It's entertaining enough, I guess, in a time-wasting kind of way, but I wouldn't run out and recommend it to everyone I know. As always, some may like it more than others. 3 out of 5 stars."
5,No leaks & No Cracked Cake!,"I began making cheesecake a couple years ago using springform pans and smoked up my kitchen due to fat from the crust leaking out of the pan into the oven. I purchased this pan with a bit of fear that the problem might be worse because of the loose, disc bottom, but because of the beautiful performance of my other Magic Line pans I was hopeful.This pan did not disappoint in any way! Nothing leaked from the pan. The graham cracker crust baked perfectly. There was NO hint of browning or cracking of the cake. The cake baked perfectly and was easy to remove from the pan.I plan to buy the square cheesecake pan as well as two 6 inch round pans. I cannot recommend it highly enough!"
2,THE APOTHECARY GOES SOFT,"Sadly this is probably the weakest of the Apothecary mysteries: there are, as always in this series, vivid and authentic descriptions of place and customs and some well-drawn, quirky characters. But unfortunately these play second fiddle to the romance between John Rawlings and the Countess. Too little of Joe Jago, Sir Gabriel and London, and too many Heyer-ish flirtatious exchanges take the edge of the story. Let's hope DL will be back on form next time!"
5,Wonderful,These are wonderful toys. We gave our dogs the hide a squirrel toy last year at Christmas and needed replacement squirrels.
2,Not exact type,The refill was a disappointment. The refill toy was MUCH smaller than the original. Probably will but a whole new toy in the future rather than getting the refill. Disappointing.
2,Chewed Through Quickly,I was hopeful when I read the reviews that my two 30 pd dogs wouldn't chew through these immediately. Unfortunately they disemboweled them really quickly and got the squeakers out. So if your dogs are major chewers like mine they will chew right through this in 15 minutes or so.
5,Tuff Toys!,"I bought these squirrel toys for my two 70lb dogs. I bought them in april 2012 and here I am leaving feedback to tell you these dogs have tried to tear them apart and guess what, they are still together. The toys are great for dogs and will keep them busy for many months. The price is worth it!"
1,Blech.,"I LOVE meringues generally, but these were awful. The cocoa had a sort of... burnt flavor to it. I also think these cookies made me sick to my stomach, which caused me to be concerned that the egg whites had not been baked at a high enough temperature to kill bacteria. (Obviously, if this was the case, it may have only been the one batch...). I ended up throwing most of the container out.I love Miss Meringues Mint Chocolate Chip flavor,which I recommend as an alternative to these. They're a bit richer tasting with the chocolate chips, so more satisfying. (No, have never had stomach aches after eating those...)"
3,"Modeling German Armor, Kind Of...","This book covers all the areas one needs to know when modeling AFV's painting, dry-brushing, photo-etched parts even diorama building. It's chapters and writing style is laid out in a logical and easy-to-read manners. Sometimes just how the author achieved certain results really could use more detail (I'm still baffled as to how to apply a wash with an airbrush). The biggest problem I had with this book is that it has very little information on the uniqueness of WWII German armor. It does not cover German camouflage schemes, the wide array of colors used or the various kind of extra gear one might have seen on a German vehicle. I does cover the application of zimmerit but fails to detail the different types, such as the waffle pattern, and on which armor it would have appeared on. On how to model armor this book is quite useful. On the particulars of German armor this book is not as useful as implied."
4,"Finally, the Truth Be Told...","This book discusses the true origins of the white race and the other Non Africanoid Races of man. Matlocke describes and reveals the hidden meanings of the symbolism in the bible. He uncovers the veiled truths that have remained secret until just revently. It is no wonder that a few people gave him bad reviews, either these people belong to fraternities and organiZations that strive hard to keep the sanctity of their secrets, or they are too stuck in their current paradigm to accept the disturbing reality that Matlocke has uncovered. This book is recommended to anyone who is interested in true world history, and anyone who is wise enough to find fault with the currently held, popular view of history."
5,Neat ideas and how to instructions,loved the new ideas and instructions on how to do the mosaics in this book. Now all you need to do is get to the hands on part of it. Excellent
3,A mixed bag.,"There are interesting ideas here, to be sure. But neither the overall conception nor the actual performances are entirely successful. The dancers, especially, seem to lack the virtuosity necessary to pull it off. Worse yet, the performance of the score feels unrehearsed and sloppy. Why can't we have a DVD of Neumeier's version?"
5,A real beauty,I loved reading this book to my daughter and she loved having it read to her. She loved searching for the hidden cats on every page. It is a beautiful story and beautifully illustrated.
1,This author has NO credibility,"Yourdon was one of the Doom Lovers who predicted that Y2K was going to be The End Of The World As We Know It. It wasn't. Instead of slinking back into obscurity like he deserved, he comes up with this unreadable tome on 911. Dull, fatuous and poorly written, this stinker will only appeal to the tinfoil-hat-wearing crowd hoping for the world to end.Truly dreadful..."
2,Tacky,"These sandles are tacky, the jewels and buckle is huge. I will not be wearing these and wasted my money on them."
1,Rutherford County Line,Well....i don't know what movie the other reviewers were watching....but this is EASILY one of the worst movies i have EVER seen. Sheeeese!!
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Less than ten uses since purchase (Aug 2012), and the wires fell off.Grew tired of buying slicers from supermarket,cheap plastic that fell apart after a few uses, so I purchased this item. Mistake."
5,Stunning,"This is a beautiful and tragic portrait of Africa. The photography is just stunning. Once I started watching, I could not turn it off."
1,Falls Way Short in the Recipes Department,"I thought this book was going to help me out in trying not to over gain as I did in my first two pregnancies. The information was good but then I tried to make one of the recipes. It has ingredients listed but doesn't tell you where to add them. As far as I have seen it doesn't list a cooking temperature once in the whole book. I was able to make the macaroni & cheese but I had to guess at what to bake it at and when to add certain ingredients. This book was really a disappointment to me. Do not buy it, you'll just waist your money!"
1,"Good-bye, This Universe","The plot/goal was not enough, Drizzt's intro's to every sectionare dull any more, I did not like the elf he introduced in this story, he should not have returned Wulfgar as the story is going,there is too much sexual innuendo( the first books hardly had any), I don't like the direction or lack of it in which the story is going, the heroes have done everything, and the character developement seems to be making them all the same character. These books aren't any fun any more."
1,sooo disappointed,"This book had to be one of the most disappointing I've read. After reading Servant of the Shard (and enjoying it immensely), I expected more challenging things for this group of heroes. But this seems to be almost a segway book, builds a few characters that need no building, they have a fairly run of the mill adventure and a slight subplot. On a sidenote...I don't really like how Drizzt and Cattibrie are coming together, kind of seems like a half backstab thing, reminds me of that movie Pearl Harbor (Wulfgar is thought to get killed, Cattibrie falls for Drizzt, Wulfgar comes back etc).. only twist is how Wulfgar found someone else in previous books, but it still [stinks] in my opinion."
3,Disappointment,"Salvatore's action always makes me read about his books.But in this one i have a confusion.Didn't Ellifain know Drizzt in Starless Night?And after all if Drizzt is an acquantaince for her,why did she want to kill him?I can understand the vengeance in her,but she knows that drizzt saved her in the ambush of the drows.There is a struggle in these good,two books,i think."
4,The trick in the bag,This is a tool in my bag that will make remote lighting much easier. All I need is my 430EX and one light stand with this clamp and I've got the photographers best friend.
3,Not meant for every flash.,"I picked up a couple of these and when I placed my 580EXII on it. I found the flash sat way too high. This stand is not meant for larger flashes. Adding a radio receiver makes the flash higher. I uploaded two photos to show the hieght of the flash.I tried using the head both ways but the result is still not what I want. I don't trust the shoe either. It likes to pivot the flash. I may keep it for a smaller flash but for my 580 and even the 430EX II, I need something aligned better and more stable."
5,Shoe Mount Clamp,Well made. Gives you the option to position your strobe and umbrella exactly where you need them. Good fit and smooth action. A great improvement over the ball/clamp fitting I was previously using.
3,"titillating title, superficial treatment","Perhaps I was hoping for something in the vein of Diane Ackerman's Natural History of the Senses or Michael Pollan's Botany of Desire; works that, while not scholarly, have a bit of depth and are at the same time engaging and entertaining.The Sex Life of Food is not in that category. To me, it read like a collection of superficial factoids punctuated with rather obvious observations and conclusions."
2,Forced politics,"The author cannot resist leaving out her political biases. Basically, Republican presidents eat baby food while Democrats eat grown up food with gusto. I can't believe I actually supported the livelihood of such a limited mind."
5,Gripping...,"I thoroughly enjoyed Stratch Line and would recommend it to everybody. I'm ashamed to even say that I was reluctant to read it initially, and had it not been a selected reading for my bookclub, I probably would not have. I found the historical aspects a bit confusing. I'm not history or civil-rights buff, but I though the term ""Afro-American"" was coined during the civil rights era, not during the early 1900's. Other than inconsistencies such as that, the book was engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat from the first page through the very last. Looking forward to a sequel about Jack."
5,One of my ALL TIME favorite books!!,I am an avid reader and I have to say this is probably one of the BEST books I have ever read. The story is so vivid that you can actually see the scenes as you read. Tremain aka King is an awesome character with so much intensity you can't help but be drawn to him. A definite page turner!!!!
4,"The ""scratch line"" is the mirror of our hopes and fears","There comes a time in all of our lives when we must face who we are. There comes a time when we must ask ourselves, ""What must I do to improve myself and to improve the conditions surrounding me?""If you are not prepared to face yourself, if you are not prepared to stand at the scratch line and face your most ardent opponent, yourself, then you do not want to read Guy Johnson and you do not want to know his hero, King LeRoi Tremain. They will not allow you to slumber in your shackles. They will not allow you your smug security while those around you suffer from bigotry. They will not say ""well done"" until mediocrity is no longer in your vocabulary or in your thoughts.If you do not want to know what it is to be a man, and pay the price, do not read Standing at the Scratch Line."
5,"COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN, MADE ME FEEL SO PROUD!!","KING REMINDED OF MR.MAN IN ROSEWOOD. WE NEED SOME BLACK REAL HEROES THAT STAND UP FOR WHAT THEY BELEIVE IN. AND THAT WORD HE HATED. SHOUT IT LOUD AND CLEAR!! I'M A NOT ONE, NEVER HAVE BEEN ONE AND WON'T ALLOW MY FAMILY OR FRIENDS TO USE IT. MR.JOHNSON MUST WRITE PART 2. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS FIRST SON."
2,Not much for the money.,"I bought this based on customer reviews and label marketing; I would not spend the money again now that I have the lights. I left the one light that worked in, and then installed the new ""Ultra"" light in to see any difference. There was very very little difference. I would save the money and get the cheaper OEM lights."
3,came w/ the truck,"when I went to replace theswe laqmps, I discovered they were exactly the same . Great Upgrade!!!!"
3,"Great lighting, No Life!","I purchased these replacement bulbs for my 2003 Dodge Ram Pick-up truck. Some improvemnet over the 9007L's that it came equipped with, but not enough to justify the much higher price. What the web-site doesn't tell you is that the life of the bulbs is only 25% of the regular 9007 bulbs! Sylanvia tells you that on the back side of the packaging. Put that on the front and I would have stuck with the less expensive bulbs."
4,LIGHT NOT AS WHITE AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE,NOT A BAD LIGHT BUT NOT AS WHITE AND BRIGHT AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE BUT BETTER THAN WHAT I HAD........
3,"Better, but still looking.","These bulbs are definitely better than OEM, but still not as brite or white as Sylvania would lead you to believe. If you are looking for a replacement bulb that is an upgrade, then these will work fine. If you want true white, or even light blue appearance, these are not for you."
5,Great high-quality bulbs,"Bought these for my 98' Escort. The ones that were in it were each a different manufacturer and had that typical yellow color, but these truly are white, bright clean white and light up the road nicely.Do not know about their lifespan, I try to use only my park lights during the day and these only when it gets darker/harder to see"
5,Bright???,The Sylvania SilverStars bulbs. Definitely a bright bulb at a very good price. Worth the money.Just hope they last as long as my stock ones...
2,Burn Out Very Fast,"I bought a set of these for both cars. Wow they are bright and do help see at night. Its brighter than hi beams, but they last maybe 1 year of avg. driving that's it! That's way to short and a hassle to pull the battery and replace with old set that are 6 years old and still work, stock OEM ones."
3,"fine lights, but don't help a 2004 Dodge Ram much","They are nice bulbs, but don't last near as long as factory bulbs, and the headlights in a 2004 Dodge Ram are so poor, that not even these bright bulbs help. I had to mount off road lights to use with my high beams, to take care of the problem. I'm sure these bulbs are fine for other vehicles, but there's no hope for factory 2004 Ram headlights."
2,Deceptive Advertisement - read the fine print.,"After installing, I was reading the packaging more closely and saw that they compare brightness between used & worn out standard bulbs versus brand new Silverstar Bulbs.And, they are much lower life bulbs (which actually was disclosed in the literature).I'm not impressed by the Apples to Oranges comparison!"
3,So far so good but . . .,"This is an edited review. I had a pair of these lamps installed in my 2006 Ford Focus. I tried to install my self but found it very difficult to do due to very little clearance. I since have found out how to do so that I did not have to take the car to a repair facility when one of the lamps failed after less than two years of service. I am a 'seasoned' driver and require every lumen I can get so I am happy with the increased output of the lamps but had hoped to get more life from them. They are not cheap by any means but if you need the extra light as I do they will do the job. Yes, I replaced with the same lamp and would do so again now that I found a way to change them myself. A hint, use a lubricant on the ""O"" ring when trying to seat the lamp into the headlight assembly and yes, saliva works well."
4,Brighter...Yes,Definitely better than the standard halogen bulbs. Not as bright white as they sound though.Would I purchase again? Yes.Would I recommend? Yes.Money well spent for a brighter bulb replacement.
2,Not so bright.,Could hardly tell the difference between these and the stock headlights on my 1997 f 250. Not impressed.
5,Excellent RoboDemo Instructional Tutorial,"I agree with prior reviews! As an independent computer consultant, I'm always looking for ways to learn new software applications economically and this was it. I downloaded Macromedia's RoboDemo 5 trail version (includes eLearning) and easily completed all lessons. This tutorial-formatted book contains clear progressive exercises. As my personal Final Exam, I was able to author a movie in which I repurposed a prior Word-based multi-document Software Lifecycle Quality Assurance methodology, a complex subject. (And, in doing so, I re-introduced myself to the value of story boarding!) This is a great companion to The Essentials of RoboHelp HTML X5!"
5,Wealth of tango,"Three hours of world's best argentine tango dancers. Almost every dance is new in terms of choreography. The wealth of steps and figures is beyond belief. Several new couples are fantastic, while the ""regular"" stars are shining even brighter. Excellent addition to my collection of tango videos."
3,"Some satisfaction, but more disappointment","This version (2004) was mediocre. It seems to me that most performers here are dull, struggling and uninspiring. They are trying very hard to get some new and exciting stuff on the stage. Unfortunately, the harder they try, the more miserably they fail. Fabian Salas (who produced this DVD), this time, seems to be totally lost in his Nuevo style. His partner, uselessly, tries very hard to save him, but to no avail. Other performers are not much better. Gavito, as much as I like him, just stands there doing nothing (we kind know the reason now - sad!).Fortunately, thanks to Reis & Cionci and arce & Montes. Without their superb performances, this DVD will be a waste. The footwork of Reis & Cionci are spectacular and the Arce's sacadas and Montes's ganchos/adornments are magnificent. They saved the show."
2,Visually distracting,"While I thoroughly enjoy seeing Russell Brand in films (especially when he plays Aldous Snow), I think he should leave the comedy stage to more adept British comedians, such as Eddie Izzard and Rowan Atkinson. He's not a terrible comedian, but he makes a better actor/singer. That, and the HAIR! My God, I couldn't quit looking at his crazy hairdo long enough to listen to what he was talking about. When doing stand-up, it is necessary to work harder on what you say than how you look. Izzard pulled it off because he was more animated than his outfit and makeup. Plus, Izzard was more well spoken. I'm not trying to put Russell down or say that Eddie Izzard is the best comedian to ever grace the stage; just that Mr. Brand might want to work on his material a bit more and tone down the rock star image when doing a stand-up comedy show."
1,Bought it and was not satisfied.,"First one lasted 3 days then quit working. [...]That one never worked right out of the box. Koolatron didn't respond to my emails about the second unit. I wouldn't recommend this product, nor any other product from this company."
2,small,much smaller than i originally thought would be. unless you are 2 inches from it you can feel no warmth.
1,It does not blow out even warm air.,I purchased this item and I have not even used it because it just blows out cool air. I does not even heat up at all. Very dissatified with this product and feel I wasted my money.
5,Still great!,"THis is the one we ran home for every day! while special effects have come a long way since Dark Shadows was on, the story still grabs you and holds your attention!"
1,Gary Puckett & The Union Gap Young Girl/Incredible,arrived in 10 days in used condition paid for new
5,Fascinating book!,"I first checked this book out of the library, but it was so fascinating that I HAD to own it! Angeles Arrien really knows her stuff -- even if you are new to Tarot (as I am) you will find this very interesting. The deck I was most familiar with was Rider-Waite, but I believe these interpretations, which are so involved and derived from so many different sources, could help you interpret any deck. This book explains a great deal of numerology regarding the Tarot, so if you like numbers, this book is for you. It helped me a lot. Yes, it is large and technical, but I am so glad to have it as a constant reference book!"
5,inspiring and insightful book,"I used this book many years ago when I was learning tarot. It recently came back into my consciousness when I began teaching tarot. I believe it's the most comprehensive and informative book I've known, especially since it focuses on the famous (or infamous) Thoth deck of Aleister Crowley. The layers of knowledge and the intricacies of interpretation are without compare, in my mind. I am delighted to have it back in my life. I have complete confidence in anything written by Angeles Arrien, and trust both the research and the intuitive treatment of her work."
3,It works.,"It works okay, but if you are expecting to receive a cable with two ferrites like the picture, forget it. Mine came with one. Not worth the trouble to send it back though."
1,Need Help,"Appears to be a well-made product. But I need a little help. I connected the double male ends, one each to my PC and LCD TV. The screen of the TV reads 'no signal.' There is also a female port on my PC which I haven't utilized. Do I need a different cable? I notice some with a Y splitter, two male, and one female connection.Also, I don't have HDMI. I didn't care for the high monthly bill for what I considered little programing that I actually liked. Does this matter? It's a new television, with plenty of ports and Viera capability. It's this one.Panasonic TC-L32X2 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV with iPod DockUPDATE:The problem was the product. It didn't work. Ended up buying a much more expensive one from Best Buy. Guess I got a bad cable. :("
1,No workie-work,"Didn't work for me. I was trying to hook up a PC to my LCD TV. The TV did not recognize that the PC was connected. Plugged in an equivalent cable from Staples (which cost 6x), and it worked fine. I made no adjustments to either the PC or TV; just changed the cable. I have to conclude I was shipped a dud, and for the $[...] I paid, it's not worth the cost to send it back. Pity, as other reviews looked promising. Alas, it didn't work for me."
1,Doesn't work,The description led me to believe this would be a cable that would be recognized both by my computer (Lenovo X301) and my television (Toshiba) for display of images on the computer or for streaming video. It did neither. The cable was not recognized by the TV at all.
1,Poor quality,"Poor picture quality. Would not fill the entire 32"" screen. I figured I'd give it a shot for the price. I ended up going to Best Buy for a better quality cable."
4,Standard Cable at a Killer Price,"It's a DVI cable in its purest form. Black, generic, it works.My only complaint is that the cable is a bit stiff, but this is a $3 cable, not Egyptian silk sheets raided from the Crusades. IT""S GONNA BE KINDA STIFF Y'ALL!"
1,Blurs Screen,"I didn't know that a vga cable could have this kind of effect on the resolution of my screen. I needed a longer cable so I got this one; when using this cable the screen blurs text, you can see it ghost across the screen, it also causes the screen to be dimmer. I changed back to my old cable and it looks perfect. This is a horrible cable!!!"
1,appears to be very poor quality,"This cable appears to be of very poor quality. It created ghost images when I used to to hook up my laptop to an external monitor. It didn't work at all with my TV. The TV simply couldn't find a signal, even though the laptop was putting it out. I ended up sending the cable back and buying one elsewhere that works fine.This was actually my second try on Amazon. The first one I got was the ""Standard 15-Pin VGA Male to VGA Male Cable"". Both ended up being the same exact product as far as I could tell, and both had the same problems!"
5,Great Product,After years of use this cable still works great. The quality has been excellent and you can not beat the price. I highly recommend it.
1,Did not support 1920x1080,I purchased this from CE Compass - which was the current top option on the day I purchased - and it does not support 1920x1080 (1080p) - the best resolution I could muster was 1600x1024 which was awful.
1,Terrible picture,I installed this on a new Dell with Windows 7 and the image was like I was looking at a tv from 1940. Contacted seller and was told to check video settings which I already did. They then would not respond back so I filed a A-Z claim.
2,VGA HD15 Cable,The cable that I bought look like a fine VGA cable. I plug this cable into my media center and into my HDTV. The result was a yellow picture. Replaced the cable with an old shorter cable and the picture was perfect.
1,REALLY BAD CABLES!,"Tried to use with Windows 7 PC and Acer 22"" monitor. Does not allow automatic adjustment when plugged into monitor and for some reason, no matter what setting I put the resolution at, it looked really bad. Another item that was so cheap, it's not worth the time ane effort to return it. AVOID!"
3,Inferior Cable Shipped,"Abacus24-7 shipped me an inferior Monoprice cable that retails for about half the price of the Cables To Go 28012 cable that I ordered. They said that Monoprice was the only brand they offered, and refunded my purchase price (except for shipping) and let me keep the cable. However, they kept advertising the Cables To Go 28012 cable on Amazon for another 10 days, and didn't stop until I complained."
2,bad connection,"The cable seems to be ok, but the image sometimes gets colour distorted, mostly because there is a bad connection in the computer side. The connector must be too cheap so you need to move it a bit until the image on the tv is ok. I didn't expect it to be that bad.."
3,"Cheap, and it works, but poorly","The price is pretty good, but you get what you pay for. The securing screws are difficult to work with, and picture quality flickers and smears noticeably more than the cable that came with my Samsung monitor. I'll go back to my old, shorter cable and keep this around as a backup."
1,Good but not great for me,"Well don't know if it the design of the plug or what but this product dose not work with my samsung 52"" t.v but with my small 19"" lcd t.v the item does work so ya not sure if the design of the plug is what might be keeping it from making a good connection or what. But does put out good picture on my small tv."
3,NOISY,"I have another Cavalry drive and did a search to find out if others have the same noise complaints and found these reviews. I'm surprised (although perhaps I shouldn't be) to see how the positive reviews truly were planted by company reps -- I didn't believe the prior poster who referred to company shills but when I looked at the other reviews of these people, I see that they were giving as many as 4 5* reviews to Cavalry products on the exact same day. Absolutely shameless."
4,".this is a beautiful,sleepy grower","Of course i got this as ima big wilco fan, and own a record store of my own...ive also found that i love the stuff john stirrat does on his own,, from his one solo vocal spot in wilco( the awesome "" RIPPLE "" on AM) BUT I FOUND MYSELF FALLING ABSOLUTLEY IN LOVE WITH THE autumn defense ALBUMS TO..AT first this sounds like a nice,gentle, simple little album of sweet country,singer songwriter stuff, but after listening to it on and off, here and there during the year i have now found myself in love with it...as i have also found myself loving the AUTUMN DEFENSE records....highly reccommeneded"
5,Excellent for Fine Hair,I have fine hair that is color treated and this shampoo-conditioner combo is excellent. My hair has never been so shiny and manageable- not to mention less flyaways and smoother cuticle. I would definitely purchase again!
4,Well Worth the Time,"Fans of Lester or Soderbergh will probably gain the most from this quick read -- an insightful conversation about making films and the creative process in general, accompanied by an entertaining diary written by Soderbergh before his acknowledged commercial breakthrough with ""Out of Sight"". Perhaps the most hilarious and witty moments come when these intelligent and engaging subjects veer off track and discuss such subjects as creationism, confidence and computers. Fans of Soderbergh's ""Schizopolis"" will particularly enjoy the author's several self-effacing moments, as well as the book's introduction. With the release of the restored ""Hard Day's Night"" and the upcoming ""Traffic"", this is the perfect time to get into the minds of these two visionaries...."
5,Easy education; impressive results.,"I had no idea I was so creative. Weekend projects not only added value to our [] starter home, they saved my marriage (and my wallet!) I am anticipating more great ideas and simple tips from Ennis and would gladly pay double for another book if it means more home equity in the future. Thanks for sparking my interest in home renovation."
2,Bulkier than expected,"First, the pros: The quality of this ""card"" is good. The material and stitching are heavy duty, and the springy frame indeed springs. I haven't had the Lastolite long enough to test, but it looks like both the gray and white faces can be cleaned of eventual miscellaneous spots well enough.The cons: For being basically a glorified windshield screen, this is expensive. I bought this small size specifically for the anticipated relative compactness when folded up. In that, I am disappointed. The Ezybalance itself folds into a pancake about 5"" in diameter, and 1.5"" thick. When put into the included zippered pouch, which is unnecessarily bulky, the stowed away size is about 7"" dia x 2"" thick. That, when trying to pack compactly, is huge. Huge enough that the thing probably won't get packed, no matter how well it works, when space is tight."
3,now what?,"After reading the reviews of this product, I ordered it anyway. Though my husband didn't care for the black and white episodes, I thought they were all great. My dilemma is that I'd like to order more Gunsmoke DVDs but don't know what to order so that I won't have a lot of duplicate shows."
5,Paramount Does It Right!!,I urge fans of this show to buy this because judging by the episode list of this set and the extras it seems to truly be a best of release. I am so glad Paramount is doing this because they seem to be proud of the shows they put on dvd. And I believe these are not double-sided dvds. Awesome!! Keep it up Paramount!!!
3,For Gunsmoke fans,this compliation of some of Gunsmoke's classics is a good bargain to the show's fans but I would recommend start buying the complete series versions first.
5,Highly recommended,"Agree with the other reviewer and I will add that these ""stories"" are brief in length, grouped by subject matter such as the ascetic life and a few are not readily understandable to the average reader. However, most are priceless and have been used for centuries to instruct those who seek to God"
4,A comparable alternative to the Kloss Tivoli,"The name ""Specialty Radio"" is a little weird, and sounds as though it was translated verbatim from the Japanese.But we've been enjoying this handsome black monolith for several weeks now, both as a radio-- and as an amplified speaker for an iPod. It has a rich, slightly boomy sound-- which even at low volume is very listenable. I think Sony has done a good job in simplifying the operation of this black box. Though it could have used a little cleaner treble at the top of its range, the radio's sound reproduction is not very far below the Kloss Tivoli. Though to my ear the Kloss has a brighter mid-range. Unless you're a serious audiophile, you'll probably think this radio sounds fine.By the way, this radio has a built in clock-- but it is NOT an alarm clock, so if that's what you were hoping for, look to another model."
3,A flawed but adequate product,The first thing I noticed about this radio was that the display light never shuts off which could be an annoyance for some. Second there are no radio presets and the volume control knob is in the middle of the knob array rather than the top. Radio reception in my application is adequate but not impressive (I am the top of a mountain with line of sight to all stations). The worst flaw is that the sound is not just warm like other radios of this ilk but is in fact boomy. This makes it fatiguing to listen to. The build and finish are very good and the radio is attractive and stylish. I could only recommend it in the $50 price range.
1,Buyer Beware!!,This applies to all Hitachi 5year warrantee tools. The NEW replacement plan begins on date of purchase and the Manufacturers Warrantee takes precedence. This translates to the replacement plan expiring before the manufacturers warrantee which means you get $0.00 payback on this plan. For other products it is an excellant plan but should not be sold with this product or with any tool that has a manufacturer warrantee longer than the life of the replacement plan.
4,Great reference guide,By far the best guide available about tramping opportunities in NZ. The track guides are pretty accurate and provide a good overview of what to expect.
4,Oooh la la,"This is a great perfume! I would only recommend wearing it on special occasions, or when you're going out. It's a strong smell, and I wouldn't recommend wearing it for day-to-day purposes. But truly a great scent to wear for a special occasion."
2,Precocious Nonsense,"I foolishly believed all the 5 star reviews and was quite intrigued by the first track - 'Big Picture'. It starts off with ambient car travel noises then fades into a minimalistic song consisting of just primitive guitar and distraught vocals. The packaging of the album is also novel but it belies the quality of the rest of the album. It is in fact rough as guts but not in an appealing way. The manic vocals become very annoying within the first 15 minutes and there is no compensating quality or novelty in the song structures - the words may be interesting but require to much effort to follow. I have a 'two song' rule ie. if I can't find two songs on a CD that I can readily listen to, then I sell the CD. I will be selling this 'Bright Eyes' CD."
2,Let us look before we pucker to kiss,"C'mon people. This album is kind of indulgent and incomplete. Honestly, it's an isnult to the fans. Oberst went from a pretty cool musician to a mass-pleasing emo whiner. Fevers and Mirrors is a masterpeice, no doubt. This album is descent but very jumbled. You will buy it and force yourself to like it more than you reall do, then it will probably stay on the shelf for a long time."
2,Morrissey lives on!,"If you're over 24, don't bother. Really. If you're not, mark my words: one day you'll be embarrassed."
3,Broad scope of Oberst's narrow view,"This weighty album finds Bright Eye's at his most eclectic with lush, sometimes over-produced instrumentation guiding the tortured vocalist through his trademark soul baring lyrics. The songwriting, while perfectly competent, even eclectically intelligent, does often become mechanized under it's plodding pace. Also, when Oberst fails to restrain his need to convey his awkwardly exploitive, emotionally fragile demeanor in the most bluntly pathetic manner it can often cheapen and disservice his overwhelming talent for such a young folk prodigy. Despite many overbearing faults this is an impressive effort that hints at the potential this artist has still only begun to hopefully realize."
2,I thought I would like it...,"I like many of the ""others who bought this cd also bought..."" artists. The Shins, Postal Service, Spoon. Bright Eyes is different. It is sad music, but I don't get the feeling it is genuine sadness. It seems very fake. I think he is whining to appeal to sad cool indie kids."
3,"Interesting, but s-l-o-w-w-w-w!","I bought this book in an airport and tore through the first 150-odd pages on a flight from Dallas to Boston.I enjoyed and admired the imagination required to create a true-to-itself world completely covered in water (sort of the ""ante-Dune), but, after being freed from the forced concentration of the airplane, I was completely uninterested in returning to the book.NOTHING WAS HAPPENING.I'm sure I'll get back to it at some point, but it isn't calling to me.The characters were obscure, hard to get close to and, in some cases, downright annoying (when one of them died - has he committed suicide? - I have to admit I was a little relieved; one less whiner to keep up with!).This book is certainly not bad and not without merit. But, judging by the way most of the sci-fi fans I know devour books, this one seems to be a tough hunk to chew.I'd love to hear a contrasting opinion; I need a reason to finish the book."
3,Grant writing for dummies....as a reference,"This is a good starter book, but it does not provide quality resources for you to practice the skills gained. You should build your skills with quality templates, references, wording techniques. I would caution readers to move on to a good intermediate work like Government Funding and You. This book will provide you with the skills to put together a quality grant with the potential LAND that grant. This book is an excellent start, but Government Funding and You is a crucial next step."
4,Sweet,As has been posted before about this item. It can be overpowering when placed next to other speakers. You have to tone it down for it to match with the othe rspeakers. All in all it is a good center channel speaker.
4,Nice product,Fit the vcr tapes perfectly. I ordered just one to see how it worked. Ordered 2 more for my other vcr tapes. Random colors or print is ok with me.
1,Like a two-hour root canal,"There is no chance that you will ever confuse Larry Kramer for Eugene O'Neill or The Destiny of Me for Long Days Journey Into the Night.Kramer's drama reads as badly as it played. It whines, nags, carps, complains, accuses and self-pities its way to an end that can't come soon enough. This work is so excrutiatingly tedious, and embarrassingly pompous, that if it didn't have the celebrity name of Larry Kramer attached to it you could be forgiven for thinking that this was the script of a play your kid brother produced in the garage.Woodsman, woodsman, spare that tree."
3,Heavy,"Extreme reading for scholars. Have your dictionary available and be prepared to read sentences and paragraphs more than once. The author is way up there on the intelligence and information scale, but the delivery is difficult for the average person to grasp. I got through it and gleaned out ancient wisdom, but it was a workout. Perhaps I am the one who is ""out of shape."" :^)"
2,Slightly interesting,"(Surprisingly large number of reviews for such a poor book.)I didn't know much about the evolution of armored vehicles and armored warfare theory, so at first I found Mosier interesting. (I thought the Pershing, Tiger, and Centurion appeared much earlier in the war than they did.) But it soon became clear that he was building straw houses to knock down, and when he dispenses with the entire Eastern Front in one paragraph (""A consideration of the Eastern Front lies far outside of the purpose of this book."" p. 176), I'd had enough.Mosier also has an annoying habit of overusing parenthetical expressions and ironic statements, so, at times, I wasn't sure, without rereading, whether he was stating his own case, weak at best, or his opponent's. (Whew! See what I mean?)I would not recommend this book for content or style."
1,A writer out of his area of expertise,Attempting to capitilize on the success of The Myth of the Great War this volume is truly not worth the read. Mosier has no conception of operational realities on the battlefield. He doesn't understand tactics either. On top of this he doesn't know much about military equipment. This leaves him with no platform of knowledge to stand on and write a book about how the tactical applications of military equipment affected operational realities in World War Two.Don't bother with this book.
4,At the top of his genre (better than Josh Groban),"I bought this CD along with Josh Groban's debut CD. Mario Frangoulis is clearly the better of the two. While both singers have beautiful voices, Groban lacks the power to really belt it out the way Frangoulis can. This (among other things) is the difference between a pop singer and an opera singer. This CD is not opera, nor was it meant to be, but at least Frangoulis has the voice. Also, because he is multilingual (he is Greek), he doesn't sound stiff or silly when singing in Italian or Spanish the way many American singers do. My only wish is that Frangoulis would stop recording so many silly pop songs and record material truly worthy of his vocal talents."
5,Above the Rest,"I think that Mario Frangoulis is better than Josh Groban or Andrea Bocelli. His range is fantastic and his voice is so pure that it just speaks to your soul. He is reminiscent of the three great tenors, Carreras, Domingo and Pavrotti. He is the best of both worlds...pop and opera. Bravo Mario!"
1,Wasted money,"My daughter screams if I try to feed her these. She honestly says, ""Yuck!"" Next time, I will buy one to try out instead of buying a whole pack of 12."
1,"Almost expired, don't buy!!!","I received a case of these (12 count) on April 4th. They expire April 12th. That's plain ridiculous. Won't be buying again - giving me a touch over a week to use them when they are a CONVENIENCE item for 90% of parents, not a regular meal item that you use daily. Not worth the $ savings - I'll buy the equivilent in beechnut at a certain national chain for $1.06 per meal and have a long expiration over this.Be warned, you are gambling on expiration with these."
3,Not a huge hip hop fan,"I gotta say i only went out and bought this because i am a huge Linkin Park fan and I wanted to see what Shinoda was capable of without his original band backing him up.I think that he should definitely stay with the rap/metal hybrid genre, but hopefully this album will make heaps of people go out and buy a good Linkin Park album (go for Reanimation if you like the rap stuff, a few Black Thought songs on there)anyways this was a great album, but i think Shinoda's rapping needs to be balanced out with someone like Chester Bennington's vocals"
4,Decent,"This is a pretty good album. The comparison between it an Linkin Park is simply inevitable. Based on its own merits it would possibly score higher, but if any of the previous Linkin Park albums get a five-star, and of course they all do, this doesn't stack up.Mike Shinoda is in good form and some of the stuff here is very well written. In fact, songs like track 6 remind me of Eminem. That's not to say he's copying Eminem; perhaps it's natural for them both, as competent rappers, to tend towards the same goal.But about this vs Linkin Park, the musical marriage of Mike and Chester is simply unassailable in its superiority. Linkin Park has the equation well fed and for me its combination of rap and rock ends up producing a better product.If you're a fan of LP, you'll like this album, but DO NOT expect it to be up to par with any of the LP albums."
4,Amazing CD.,"Mike Shinoda is really impressive in his first solo album. Remember the Name is a great song, very catchy. This CD though, as good as it is, is annoying at times. It seems like 13 or 14 of these songs are about how everyone was dissing him, saying he couldn't make it, or whatever. Ok, Mike, you did it! Good work. Now shut up about how everybody in the world wrote you off and told you that you couldn't rap."
5,Amazing,"This CD is so good. I am a rap fan and this is at the top of my playlist for the sick beats and good, tight lyrics. My favorite songs are Kenji and Out the Back."
5,Doggie in Denim,I bought thois for my 2 pound teacup Yorkie and it firs him perfectly. Love it and I bought the matching dress/harness for my larger female.
1,Won't open after a year.,I've bought this type and won't open anymore after 1 year. New batteries and green light indicates it should open but would not. Sentry is unreliable. Don't buy Sentry or else regret it after a year.
1,Better buy a hammer too,"After 3 short months of infrequent use (opened it once a week at most) the safe stopped working. Just as everyone else indicates, you get a green light, you can hear the actuator attempting to open the dead bolts....and.....wait for it.......NOTHING. After doing research and calling support, their solution is to bang it just below the keypad with a hammer. You read that correctly, the solution is to bang it with a hammer. Well my safe now has about 30 dents in it and it hardly opens. Yes, I'm incredibly persistent and cheap, but I've had enough as it hardly opens now. Time to invest in a Honeywell. I hardly leave reviews, and a bad one is rare, but 1 star is too generous for this product."
1,Doesn't open,"I'll add my voice to the chorus of people who note this safe doesn't open. That's a bit strong - after fifteen minutes of typing in combo (correctly) dozens of times and banging on the door to try to unstick the mechanism, I finally got it open. I didn't mind that it's really heavy when I bought it, thinking it would last a lifetime. But having to replace after a few years is really unfortunate - going to be very difficult to dispose of. Now I need to find a replacement that will hopefully be a bit more reliable."
4,Nice product,"This is a nice globe. Good quality. Looks good illuminated. Just make sure that you consider whether you want an illuminated globe. I like the idea, but it is not conveniently portable. You always have to consider the cord. If an illuminated globe is what you are after, this is nice. The black is a nice contrast."
4,Mostly serves its purpose,"I have a Sony Ericsson Z520a and bought this as a replacement for the name brand charger I got with the phone. While it does charge, I am unable to get the battery charged to more than 98%. I am unsure, however, if this is because my battery is less effective than when new. But, all said, it serves its purpose."
1,Wrong battery,"This battery does not fit the camera I purchased. The camera comes with a battery, so why did you try to sell me another one, one that does not fit, no less? I have returned the battery but have not heard back from you on the return. It has been two weeks."
5,Wiggly wonderful!,My son owns every Wiggles DVD that has been released in the US. This DVD contains a great selection of Wiggles songs & will be a hit for any Wiggles fan.
3,Mostly songs on DVD,"I was disappointed when my daughters first played the DVD to find that there were very little skits. The DVD is filled with many songs - too many in my opinion. My 2 year old was not that excited about watching the DVD where she always asks to watch one of the Wiggles episodes. Side note, who is Sam? My older daughter and niece were baffled."
5,THE BEST of all songs!!,My 2 year old loves the songs the best from the shows! This is an entire dvd devoted to just the songs/dances! 30 of them!! Perfect!!
2,not so good,it wasted my money just to buy a book but other prices were high it wasnt something good to read
3,Get what you pay for,"This is an okay tripod. It works fine--not great, not awful. If you're on a budget and just looking for something simple, you'll probably be thrilled with it! I'm not sure if mine lost a piece or is suffering from regular wear and tear, but is no longer functional. The piece that supports the camera has no tension and the camera just 'flops' over and can't be aimed/lifted. It worked fine for probably 6 months to a year, but now I need a new tripod."
5,Great for price,"It's a little short. You have to bend over or take a knee at it's maximum height. But for the price, it holds my Nikon D90 well."
4,Good Tripod For the Money,Solid tripod for the money -- good value -- good product. Not the best but can't be beat for the price I paid.
5,outstanding,since I've been using amazon it have been outstanding & arrive on timeas shedule keep up the good work
1,Worst tripod - don't buy,I bought this tripod two weeks before. The legs are shaking when I extend. I'm unable to take pics from this tripod. It is similar to using our hand instead of tripod. Please don't buy this. You can pay extra $5-$10 and go for some other model or brand.
4,"Good, basic tripod, great value","The Sunpak 2001UT tripod is a good basic tripod, esp. for digital cameras. The reason for my saying this is that this is a light-weight tripod, and its maximum load is about 4.2 pounds. This is sufficient for digital cameras that do not use interchangeable lenses, and also for SLRs or digital SLRs that use a lightweight lens. So, if you have a 300mm telephoto or zoom lens on your SLR you MUST get something heavier and sturdier. For others whose camera (plus lens) is less than 4 pounds, this lightweight tripod is perfect. It's pretty good quality, easy to use, has a quick-release camera plate (so you can take the plate with the camera for that quick handheld shot), and is light enough to carry with you anywhere you go."
4,Should be taller,"This is a nice tripod but the attaching wingnut is hard to access (for me) and it should extend higher. I'm 6'5"" and another 6-8"" of height on this would be nice"
4,must have item,"great for getting rid of flares, as well as protecting your lens element. I bought this to protect my Canon 28-135mm lens."
4,Halfback Tough,Halfback ToughThomas J. DygardThe book that I read was halfback tough. I gave this book a 4 out of 5 stars because the book was about my favorite sport and it was a good book about how a kid had to work his was up on the football team from the bottom to the top.My book is about named Joe Atkins that had to change schools because he was always getting into trouble with his old friends. At the new school he tries to start a new life and to become a better person. As that happened he was trying new things like he went out for the football team. He found out that if you go out for a sport you have to maintain eligible. Once that he started to pay more attention in class and became a better student and wasn?t always getting into trouble. Then he became on of the best football players at the school he played wide receiver. This book was an okay book but the only things that had interested me the most was when it was a football game or something to do with the football game.
3,This book wasn't that good.,"I didn't really like this book because it was boring. It wasn't that interesting. The language was hard to read. But the book had some good parts. The football parts were the best. Other than the football parts, the book [wasnt that good.]"
4,VeryPLEASED,"I ordered this for a program at school the top looks real buttons( they are not, there is velcro under them to actually attach the shirt) and all the hat took my son a little getting used to he is 7 and wore it as big as possible and it was tight on his forehead at first. The quality for the price was great.He wants to wear it for halloween(at least for now)."
4,My son LOVES this set,It looks pretty legit. The belt that comes with it is one step above crap though. Splurge and buy a new one. The shirt is velcro so you have to take special care when washing it and caring for it. Could easily be updated to working buttons. The material is great. This is now the second time I'm purchasing this outfit because he keeps outgrowing it but insists on having it back. I'm sure I'll be back in a few months to buy the next size up!
1,I had a VERY bad experience with the Price Pros,"I ordered a Halloween Costume for my son on October 14, I was suppose to receive it on or before the 21.. Well they sent me the wrong costume, and they said they would correct it by sending me the costume I ordered.. well here it is the 26 and now they tell me the are out of stock on the costume I ordered for my son... And now I have to scramble to get him a costume.. They have RUINED my sons HALLOWEEN.. I will NEVER buy another thing from them again.. In fact I hope no one else does either.. And I hope they go BANKRUPT!!!"
4,Well-researched account of little-known killer,"Harold Schechter's books are great, and in my opinion Deranged is the best of them. 'True Crime' books tend to be overly-sensational or poorly written, this is neither. This is a very shocking book, I'm surprised that more people don't know about Albert Fish. After reading Deranged, I have looked for other books about Fish and have been unable to find a single one, yet his crimes are about the most brutal I've read about. The fact that he preyed on children makes this absolutely terrifying. As fascinating as it is horrific, this is a must-read for crime buffs."
2,"Bizarre subject matter, tedious reading","Deranged is Harold Schecter's true crime history of the fascinating, horrifying life of Albert Fish. The reader must be prepared for graphic detail, which is often scatological and consistently perverse and disturbing. On the surface, Schecter falls short of creating a suspenseful nonfiction novel. His arbitrary historical anchors and tedious inclusion of irrelevant details detract from the coherence of the story. Even so, the extremity and depravity of Fish's behavior create an original, unforgettable glimpse into the workings of a criminal sexual psychopath. I recommend this book to true crime buffs who have not yet heard much about the case of Albert Fish because there are no other books on this subject that I have yet located."
2,Gross!,This case is a complete dirt and lint magnet. It is not ideal for a woman who would keep it in her purse.
4,so far so good,"serves its purpose in protecting the Z22. also, the sillicon material provides great traction on smooth surfaces....just gets a little dusty...otherwise great value for something not fancy and practical"
4,In Response to T.A. (I had to delete my first review to write this one),"Wow, I think some people are out there to criticize other reviewers rather than the artist. Just because I don't particularly enjoy Amanda's music does not mean I am an incompetent trumpeter who is blabbering about nonsense (I have been playing for 7 years).I will admit that when I first wrote the review I had less experience to listening to many diverse styles of music and thus my review showed some bias. However, Amanda still does not compare to the trumpet greats such as Maurice André, Wynton Marsalis, Rafael Mendez, and certainly not Sergei Nakariakov. Her technique is brilliant, her tone is full; yet, she is lacking the effortless musicality that is inherent in these masters of the trumpet. I am in no way saying that I play better than her but what T.A. said ""I think he can play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" shows how shallow and bitter she is to other critcism."
1,"These are MINI - Not for vehicles, for ATV or smaller","These are titled Compact Chock Set, thus thought they were just compact. Howevver when I received the box said ""MINI Chock Set"". They are MINI, and box says only for ATV or smaller. Don't buy they for a RV or trailer, etc - they will be too small."
2,Review of Condition of Item,The DVD was not made well...a great part of the movie skipped...so I was very disappointed... Love old movies...so if the condition was better would have loved it....
1,Poor Prodict,I am waiting to return the tri-pod. When I recived it it was broken and waiting to send it back to the company I got it from. This is telling me the company that Amazon is in with is not a good company. Until I get a reply my feelings are the same.
2,Too much words without use,"I got extremely tired of this book after just a few pages. Why are 15 sentences needed to describe how to turn on the tap water? Why use 500 words to say that someone was poor. Also, I got extremely tired of the description of how the fantastic he was to for a short time have to live almost like poor people. The contempt for the people living together with their chickens and cows were palpable.In the end I only had to read a few sentences for every page, the rest was just overuse of ink. The chronology was in shambles, no real structure used when trying to describe historical events. And just the idea to meat the vietnamese General Giap, one of the greatest characters, while stoned got me really pissed off.Think of this book as a ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", but less well written, placed in Vietnam on how the author and his buddies got stoned all the time and had vietnamese running around buying opium from them."
5,"Superb Music, Superb Performance ...",".... which I've already reviewed, since it's available in a two-for-one release, combined with a full CD of Boccherini's symphonies, performed by Ensemble 415. Above all, it's the sublime Stabat Mater that you WANT to hear, even if you've never heard of it before now. Grab whichever release you find avaialble at the right price."
5,Simple and Dynamic!,"I have read a number of books dealing with positive thinking and creative visualization techniques, and while I thought they were good, this book makes me want to buy copies for everyone I know! The explanation of why it works is fascinating and the techniques are easy to understand. What I especially liked was reading that we don't necessarily have to believe the affirmations in order for them to work. A whole load of frustration and guilt rolled off my shoulders at that moment. So...read! Apply! Enjoy! Succeed!"
5,Awesome To The MAX!!!,"who remembers dominoes?? I mean real dominoes...not just stacking them up and knocking them down dominoes...I'm talkin straight bones! in a world of virtual reality, cyberspace, and even still TV, there's something nostalgic and unique about taking a set of dominoes out to a park on a sunny day and just enjoying life. Very rarely will you find a game that can bring all ages together, and for that, I salute to you, dominoes."
4,ferrite beads,"The cable is the beefiest modern monitor cable I've seen (cable says ""Bailiheng"").Note: The ferrite beads on the ""C2G / Cables to Go - 28011"" are huge; they won't thread through some desk or monitor stand holes."
2,Multiple order mistakes,"The product they sent was not at all what I ordered. You are going to get what you pay for (an inexpensive, cheap cable). Instead of the sturdy 6 foot cable with the heavy connector they depicted, they sent me a flimsy 4 foot cable with the standard, cheap blue connectors. After I wrote a poor review they contacted me to make it right and sent me another cable, but the second cable was just as cheap as the first! The only thing different was that they gave me a 6 foot cable this time instead. I can understand one mistake, but twice in a row tells me the company is flawed. Pay a buck extra to save yourself the hassle."
4,I found it very useful.,"I read this book as a supplement to my more general preparation for the exam. Don't expect to pass the exam by only reading this book. It is a GUIDE and should be used as such. It helped me focus on issues that were vague in my mind and it helped me summarize my knowledge of Java that I acquired over thousands of hours of practice. I didn't try the practice exams, so I can't comment on them. But the exercises throughout the book are very good. The only really negative point I would mention is this excerpt: ""I expect that you know how to do things like write a simple ""Hello, world"" program and ... You don't need to be an expert to begin studying for the exam ..."". I guess most unhappy reviewers got caught by this commercial bait. All that's missing is the ""Get Java certified in 21 days"" jingle. Appart from this I was quite satisfied, the book met my expectations."
3,Very helpful but keep your eyes open,"This book was very helpful and after studying it about 10 hours I was able to pass the programmer exam. However, the book is full of errors. Some of them very critical errors that can seriously confuse someone who isn't paying close attention. If you use this book make sure that you verify anything that doesn't make complete sense because it is probably wrong. It is useful as long as you take what it says with a grain of salt. Hopefully in later printings the errors will be corrected and it will become an excellent book. However the current errata on the book's website isn't even close to complete and there is actually an error in the errata itself"
3,Insufficient by itself,"Other readers have pointed out that there are errors in this book. Indeed it is true, even after you apply the errata available at the web site. But the biggest problem is what this book leaves out. There is almost no coverage of type conversion, an important topic; nor is there mention of String pooling, making his coverage of the == operator for the String class misleading. Many other areas are equally lacking in coverage. Yet, this book has the best sample exams.For some, the answer is to get the Heller book; for others, it's just as good to turn to the free Java Language Reference which gives the nitty gritty not covered by Boone. And don't forget to supplement with the many great online discussion groups and such."
4,I did get certified...,"I did get the Java Programmer's 1.1 Certification after studying this book (on first try, no additional classes). Well organized and nice layout for studying and the '2-in-1' is a great bargin compared to other Certification Guides. I personally did not find many errors in the text not mentioned in the online errata. Practice tests are similar to actual test, although there should be maybe 5 practice tests, rather than 2.Reason for -1 star: CD-ROM was pitiful. It was only ~100k of information most of which was links to the 'pay as you go' courses. Needs to have several dozen more code examples and practice exam questions, otherwise, don't bother looking at it."
3,"Usefull for Java certification study, but full of errors.","This book is very helpfull as a tool for studying for Java certification. The material is concise and the reader can learn a lot of Java in a short time. But beware! This is another of those ""race to be first on the shelf"" computer books and it is full of inaccuracies and plain typos that stick out like sore thumbs. Many of the errors are corrected in the on-line errata available through the publisher's web site. But many errors are not mentioned and have fallen through the cracks."
2,didn't work,It didn't work. But Amazon refunded without question.It may have been a nice analog meter if it had not been broken.
1,"""Small"" ball is VERY big","I was very disappointed when I received this, but it's too much trouble and costly to return. I have a small mixed breed dog, and this ball is about 1/2 his size - which way to big for him to play with or pick up with his mouth. I do like the material, but that's it. After it came I checked the description and it does say 6"" diameter, so that is accurate - but come on, what small dog has a mouth that big??"
4,"Great series, wrong version.","Zoids: Chaotic Century is one of my favorite animes. When I saw the DVD at Borders, I nearly blacked out. It was only 15 dollars, so I bought it. As soon as I'd gotten home, I popped it in my DVD player and was practically in Nirvana, but was a bit disappointed.The downside of this DVD is simply that this is the edited English dub, meaning that that the DVD was in kids' format sadly. There should be a bilingual version, and the episodes on this are some of the most questionable ones to be aired on CN, they should have left them undedited. These are great epidsodes, wrong version. If you want to watch Zoids at its best, download the Japanese version, it's better."
4,1869 version of Romeo and Juliet Overture,I was delighted to see Tchaikovsky's original 1869 version of his Romeo and Juliet Overture. One can see why he revised it. It is a neat recording for anyone looking for rare Tchaikovsky recordings.
2,Nothing ULTRA about it,"Except for a whiter colored light, they did not extend the range of vision in any way from my OEM lights (which are around 10years old)."
2,Didn't improve visibility,"I put these in a 1997 Oldsmobile LSS which had never had the headlights changed and about all I could tell was that they were a bit ""whiter"" in light. They were no brighter that the 15 year old OEM Low Beams. Very disappointed in the advertised ""Up to 40% increased down-road visibility and rated at up to 50% brighter light than standard halogen headlight bulbs"". I would say I have no improvement in visibilty and maybe 10% brighter than the OEM's, but I attribute this to the fact that the headlights were 15 years old. FYI, the lens on the Olds are in very good shape and not fogged."
4,"Great Light, but not very long life",I have been buying these for a few years now and the price on Amazon just can't be beat. They increase your light output at least 3x what stock headlights put out. The only problem with them is that if you have a car with daytime running lights they will only last about 6 months. Using them only at night they will easily last over a year though.
1,Not worth the money,I found no significant increase in low beam light output although the high beam was worth the money. There is a light deflector coating on the low beam lamp and another on the headlight casting. I even removed the coating on the bulb with no significant light output.
1,Regular High-Beams are Safer!,"We may be glad we can see the road better with super-bright headlights, but if we are unable to dim them when there are oncoming drivers present, we are presenting a safety hazard to others. There is a reason that drivers are only supposed to use their high-beam lights where it is very dark and there are no oncoming drivers: super-bright headlights are a DRIVING HAZARD! They blind oncoming drivers temporarily. In city environments, where streets are well lit and one is not likely to hit a deer, there is really no cause to use super-bright headlights. But if you really can't see without super-bright headlights, why not just use the high beams your car came with and dim them when someone else is on the road? You might save yourself from causing an accident!"
3,Pricey for such a short life,"I drive 100 miles to and from work a day. I leave at 4:45am and obviously its still dark every morning. Traveling by interstate and secondary roads, visibility is a HUGE concern. While intially these bulbs work OK, they really didnt impress me for brightness or range. I bought them on Nov 18 2011. On January 15th 2013, the passenger side failed and had to be replaced.These bulbs arent cheap and experience taught me they dont last very long either. I should have listened to the reviews about the bulbs quality and lifespan before buying. I wont make that mistake again."
2,Not that great.,"I returned these because I did not see much improvement over the $10 pair from Walmart which were the 1 step up from basic level. Yes they are white, but that is from the blue coloring on the bulb which take away from the brightness. Also they burn out faster so I felt it was a waste of money."
2,not worth the effort,"I replaced the headlight on my 2011 Ford Superduty, Not worth the time and effort to replace. The Ultras are no brighter, they do shine a little more to the side , not much. When they burn out I will install factorty bulbs back in ."
4,Rebate Info,"If you happen to buy two sets of Silver Star lamps because, say, you want to install a complete set in your car, be aware that the rebate limits each household to one rebate. In other words, order them separately (free shipping over $25) so you have separate receipts to send in for rebate (one for you, one for your buddy or child at a different address...I hate to see a rebate go unpunished!!!)As for the Silver Star product, I like the light produced, but life is a problem, particularly when I added a relay system to run them directly off the batteries of my GMC diesel. (GM has an annoying habit of undersizing the headlight wire and switch, so you have a 2 volt drop from accessory circuit to lamp, and eventual switch burnout if you use a slightly higher power lamp.)"
5,Worth the extra cost,"I was extremely apprehensive about spending so much for headlights, but the first time I turned them on, all my doubts disappeared! I drive past a nature reservation every night from work and it is *huge* spot for deer. I am always terrified driving home at midnight....These headlights are like my own personal zone of daylight!! I have no worries whatsoever now about not seeing a deer on the shoulder waiting to run at me"
1,I'm Burned Out on 'em!,"I have had two sets of these bulbs in my 2001 Honda Accord. The first set was the Silver Star standard bulbs. The first bulb burned out in 4 months. The second bulb blew a few weeks later. About a year later, the guy at the auto parts store talked me into trying the new ""Ultra"" Silver Stars saying that they were much improved. he was right. They lasted 50% longer. The first bulb burned out 6 months after installation! I was disgusted and pulled the second one out.I ended up putting the bulbs that came with the car back both times. Those bulbs are now 7 years old and still going strong.I say, don't waste your money unless you need them for a very special road trip."
4,Great lights,"Lights look great definitely stand out at night, light up road more, just wish they made the bulb size for the fog lights on my car. Extremely fast shipping!"
2,"""Ultra Short Life Span""","I have installed theses bulbs in my 2005 Toyota Corolla. The First set was in for 12 months when the first bulb went out and while I was looking for the receipt the other followed within two weeks. At this point I thought maybe I was wrong on how long they were in, So I decided to buy another set and this time I kept receipt in my glove box. The first bulb went out in 13 months after install second bulb followed 10 days after. They do have a nice white light if you can afford 35-50 dollars every year. I will not be buying these again."
2,"Excellent Idea, Terrible Execution","These headlights are very bright and great while they work. Unfortunately to get the extra light output, bulb life had to be sacrificed. Expect about 12 months out of these bulbs and consider yourself to have won the lottery if you get 15 months out of them. Figured I'd try them out but for how expensive they are I'm not going to replace my headlights every year when the OEM ones last 4 to 5 years. Not worth the extra light for the money."
2,Good lamps if you can get them cheap,"Unfortunately I paid the full list price at a local store and in fewer then six months the bulb had broken. Only then did I realize they have a life span of hundreds, not thousands, of hours. At list price it would not be worth it compared to lesser quality but longer lasting and cheaper bulbs. However, when purchased with rebates and deep discounts this could be a good value as long as you don't mind replacing it frequently.For someone who rarely drives at night these are recommended."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought these for my wife's vanfiguring they would light up our dark roads better. i saw no real appreciable difference in lighting. They lasted 2 years and were shot. Buy some other brand!!!
2,"Bright, but not for long.","Got the bulbs in December of 2008. Great improvement over OEM. However both bulbs burned out this week, August of 2009. Headlight bulbs should last more than nine months. Not sure what the deal is. Buy with caution."
2,Short life span????,"Ahhhh C'MON!!!!I was going to buy these headlight bulbs - UNTIL I read most of these reviews and checked on some other material.--- 8 - 12 months!That is DEFINITELY not what I'm about to purchase. I've been driving for quite a while and know what is and what is not a bargain. These do not appear to be a bargain (for me).I know Sylvania wants to make a profit but - 8 - 12 months AND they start to dim even before that. I also do not buy the line that one should change out the lights every 12 months. At the ""VERY"" earliest, I would suggest, 'MAYBE,' every 24 months.But it is finally time to change mine out - I've had them in for a little over five years and they are dimming (I've been lucky I guess in the longevity of these bulbs - Honda Accord V6).I am really glad to have read all the reviews and am just not about to shell out for these at this time...."
4,High Quality Dive Computer,We bought two of these wrist computers. Oceanic has a well known name in the diving world and we are very pleased with the functionality of these computers. It has been a little difficult to get the online owner's operational tutorial that is available through Oceanic. Other than that these make a super back-up dive computer for our primary dive computer.
4,"Love,Love, Love Michael Kors!!","My favorite scent by Michael Kors..This signature scent turns heads where ever I go!! Not to strong or light but subtle and captivating!.The price was fair to reseonable, would love to get a even better price but definately worth it!! Enjoy.."
1,Beware!!!!,"Doese not even come close to making 84 outfits,there are not enough decorations. My daughter was very disappointed and this toy did end up in the trash!!!!"
3,"Good for individual investors, less useful for professionals","Focused on real estate deals in the <$2MM category, this book offers a treasure trove of helpful tips about how to work the angles to create maximum wealth from real estate investing. Especially useful are sections on goal-setting, negotiating, dealing with banks, and secondary financing.The book is less useful for development professionals dealing with larger developments such as office buildings, apartment communities, etc, as it omits extended discussion of the institutional players. Both individuals and development professionals will find Zuckerman, Real Estate Investment and Acquisition Workbook a useful adjunct, with development professionals perhaps more intested in Brueggeman & Fisher, Real Estate Finance and Investments than this offering."
3,"Bland, but informative","A good reference book for funding your real estate projects. Not very motivating, but a good tool to have in your library nonetheless. There's got to be better out there, I just have'nt come across it yet."
2,I was disappointed.,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I paid quite a bit of money to be able to read this book, and I wish I hadn't. I was expecting a machaivalian hero, but Domineco was just plain evil with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. He was a rapist, a brutal murderer and a spoiled, cold brat.The book was told in first person from the heroine's perspective and because of that all we could do was be victimized by the ""hero"" and muddle about in the dark looking for the ""romance"" in this romance novel. It was a gruesome book that made my skin crawl. Only the last five pages were what you would expect from a romance novel.I can take a difficult read, I don't need flowers and hearts to be satisfied by a romance novel, but this book was just not good at all."
1,Not worth the money,"The minute I took it out of the box I knew I would return it. And that was before I even opened the book! The pages aren't numbered but it appears to have about 25 pages in it. Taking the price into consideration that comes to almost $1 a page. Additionally, inside there are many blank areas to write your ideas on so ultimately I was spending $19.95 for a note pad. Too bad. Everyone else seemed to love the ideas the author presented. I couldn't get past the feeling of being cheated to even read her ideas."
5,Handsome Watch,"The Skagen Titanium #342XLTTW is a handsome, streamlined watch. The most striking feature is the flow of the band into the case."
3,"Beautiful watch, but has some problems.","The watch is really nice. I like the colors; the titanium is a sort of silverish grey/tan and the white on the dial is also a little bit grey or off white.The face is large, so make sure you want that.There was one problem with it though. After a day of wearing the watch, my husband discovered that one of the pins is not securely placed in the setting. i.e. one side of the strap could come off at any time. It took us a long time to fit it in properly (NOT as easy as it sounds, since you are dealing with a titanium strap). It is surprising that Skagen should ship out an improperly assembled product!"
5,Absolute proof that 1914 is a LIE!,"This book is not for light reading.The facts contained in it are overwhelming, the depth of research is impressive.If you still believe the JW story of '607bce -> 1914' after you read this book, then you simply have not read the book.Don't judge this book without reading it."
5,Excellent gift,I bought this as a birthday gift for my father. It does and excellent job and my father enjoys it immensely. It was the perfect addition to all of his chef gear.
5,ice cream maker,"Arrived as expected and in the original box, unopened. The product is like most ice cream makers. Works properly and makes good ice cream (if the recipe is followed appropriately, of course). I used to have an old wooden one. I like this much better."
3,It works,"This is my first ice cream maker and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on one. As usual, I refer to Amazon reviews for product selection, and thought this one would suffice. It does. Making ice cream can't be rocket science, and this one does the job nicely. I would suggest it to anyone."
5,Works great!,"I've used it to make a few batches, it is working great! Hasn't had an trouble yet. Very happy with it!"
2,Ice Cream Makier falls short.,"This ice cream maker is not all that it reports to be. Takes forever to make and the machine does not ""automatically"" shut off when it is finished. Also, the ""change in sound of the motor"" that is supposed to be heard when the ice cream is done does not exist."
4,Automatic Ice Cream Maker a big hit with my family!,I am truly pleased with the performance of the Hamilton Beach ice cream maker. I used it the day it arrived. The price was not bad either. The same item at Targets was $15 more.Thanks for the prompt shipment.
1,terrible machine,I was so disappointed in this machine - I used exactly twice before it broke -- We followed instructions to the letter and it broke -- the motor broke -- it doesn't mix ice cream very well-- it is made of plastic which breaks --
3,ice cream maker,Almost everything is fine about this product.We used it once and it seems okay for now. The only reason we didn't give a 5 star is the cord is way too short. Whats up with that Hamilton Beach? What's it cost for 2 more feet of electrical cord? These manufacturer aggravate me when they do such stupid things and try to cut cost. Charge me another dollar for a decent length cord you bunch of clowns. Absolutely ridiculous
1,Dead on First Try,"I'm exceptionally disappointed in this product, given the good reviews. The motor stalled out on the first batch we attempted to make. we tried testing the motor alone, and it stalled without anything connected to it. My son is exceptionally disappointed, as he was so looking forward to homemade ice cream."
4,Good Kid's Fantasy,"""The King in the Window"" is an excellent young adult fantasy novel. It describes France well, and gives a sprinkling of French words. It has a likeable protagonist, Oliver, who is not brave or clever but who must learn to be a king. The plot, involving history, literature, modern technology, glass, mirrors, window-wraiths, and Alice in Wonderland is quite original. The themes of finding strength and bravery are traditional but timeless. I did not find it to be particularly exciting--there was no sense of danger, and nothing bad happened. Still, it kept me turning the pages, eager to see what would happen next. The characters were also sometimes annoying. But overall, a good read. It would be best for a middle-school age audience, for which it would have the most novelty. It is long for readers younger than that. A fantasy-loving adult could enjoy ""The King in the Window"" as a diversion, but it would not have much impact on them as a story."
2,not the same...,came on time but despite its claims this off doesn't work nearly as well as the benedryl brand. it took way too long to start working and when it did it only slightly removed some of the allergy symptoms.
1,nausea after usage,"I dont notice any positive effects, however, I feel nausea the next day after usage.therefore, I dont recommend it."
1,Don't fall for this!,"6x16 tea bags - an 89% saving...Sounds too good to be true?!? Well, it is. Instead, you receive only 1 box containing 16 tea bag and no response from the seller upon my request to either supply the remaing 5 boxes or to provide a refund. The shipping costs more than the product! Don't fall for this one."
4,Good price and quality,Shipped fast and price was good for the quality. Wish they made more heavy duty one for a little more money. Would reccomend this product.
1,Awful,These are suppose to be free of dyes and perfume and they stink!I've requested my money back.Do not buy these they smell awful.
1,Horrible Allergy to this product!!!,"I have been extremely ill for 3 months now. Been to ENT doctor, regular doctor, and have had MRI, Cat Scan; and everything was negative. I have an allergy clinic appt. next week, but I already know what the problem is. I washed my bedding and a dryer sheet got stuck in between the sheets, and my head swelled so badly, that I was suffocating to death! I have had head swelling and gland swelling with my throat closing off for 3 months now, but this was the worst this morning! OMG! It's the Bounce dryer sheets! I will never use this product again, or any other dryer sheets. Just horrible! If I had money, I would sue them for sure!Bounce Renewing Freshness Fabric Softener Sheets - 250 ct"
2,I was sent out of date product.,"I've ordered these beef n cheese sticks 2 times. The first time I was sent product that was almost out of date, and missing 1 of 36. The second time I received product that was almost 2 months out of date. I am very disappointed."
2,Patricia C. Wrede,I like most of Patricia C. Wrede books but this one was very boring and lacked a good story line dont get this book.
4,I enjoyed it.,"I will have to disagree with the professor. For a young adult book it served its purpose as entertainment. I do not believe it was meant to be scholarly work. I hope the author writes more books. She has a way with words that makes the reader visualize what is going on. The one thing I will say that kind of bothered me was how quickly the characters solved their issues. Other than that, I loved it."
3,revision is misleading,It is a great book but I ordered it for a certain song that was in the first edition. That song had been removed from this edition. That was disappointing
2,scientifically unsound,"Even if cutting edge science and metaphysics are somehow connected, E.Laszlo does not manage to explain this connection adequately.Many of the scientific theories he takes for granted do not meet with the acceptance he presents them to and many of the ""experiments"" he presents are dubious.He gave me the impression his book is based on four or five books of popular science, which he uses to describe cutting edge scientific theories in his own words and which he mixes with metaphysics, taking large leaps of logic.What disturbed me the most is that he kept referring to ""waves"" without actually saying *what* is being waved....The book becomes less and less scientific as it progresses to the last chapters, where he writes about Near Death Experiences and Past Lives."
2,A theory of nothing,"This book was a big dissappointment. This first third of the book establishes some of sciences greatest puzzles. This was an OK summary. The rest of the book deals in vagary. The author introduces the idea of the zero point field as the answer to everything. He talks of the idea of an evolving universe without any substantive link to the zero point field. He purports that the thought energy in our brain disturbs the zero point field and that this distubance can be decoded by others (eg. telepathy). None of this is proved in anyway nor backed up with any thing other than conjecture. The author wallows in half explained ideas and jargon. This was an awful read and I definately do not recommend it. The zero point field may indeed explain alot of the unexplained in physics, but you definately won't gain an understanding of that from this book."
1,Case broke the CD,"The first time I used the CD, it was difficult to remove the disk from the case. Somehow I managed without cracking the disk. The yoga workout was great and I eagerly looked forward to working out with Rodney again. On my second try, I wasn't so lucky. The disk cracked and no longer plays in my CD player or computer. So while the content might be stellar, your use of it may be short-lived due to the overly tight center button that holds the disk in place."
5,Scavenger Hunt,"I love this movie. It is by far one of my favorites. I can't watch it enought. No matter how many times I see it, it never loses the humor. I really wish they would put this on DVD. I can't believe they haven't yet. I have had 3 copies of it and I have worn out all 3, and am trying to get a 4th. I can't even think of a movie that can come close to Scavenger Hunt. The actors are great."
4,Just a fun movie for the whole family!,"I have loved this movie since I was a teen-ager. This is one that I have been looking for to add to the collection of videos that the whole family watches at Thanksgiving. You will laugh til you cry. P.S. Arnold Schwarzeneggar makes a cameo appearance in this movie as, what else, a fitness instructor!"
2,Mistakes,"Similar to the 4th edition, the Coverage of the theoretical background of topics is good. However,mistakes in example problems make it hard to follow, especially for undergraduate students. Also, section properties used in some problem solutions are not all updated to the 13th Edition of AISC manual. The book needs to be reviewed thoroughly with additional numerical examples."
2,Many errors,"Like another reviewer said, this book has a lot of errors. I have been using the 4th edition paperback in class for about 2 months now and my class has found more than a few errors. It seems like everytime the professor assigns some problems out of the book, he has to change one or more because they are wrong. Very frustrating. Additionally, the problems in this book are designed for the old A36 steel. Otherwise, this book seems to cover a lot of material and is pretty easy to understand."
2,Crabbe is no Carr,"I chose to read this book because it was favorably compared to Caleb Carr's 'The Alienist', a book which I loved. I would like to prevent any other readers from making the same mistake.Crabbe sure knows a lot of information about the Brooklyn Bridge, but his delivery needed some more editing and polish. I found his attempt to write accents, and what he must suppose was southern use of language, was laughable. It was also frustrating to read several pages of irrelevant story, for no better reasons than to impart more statistics and facts about the bridge itself.Please do not read this book because of the comparisons to Caleb Carr. Read this book because you think the plot sounds interesting, or you like the cover art or anything other than the comparisons to 'The Alienist.'"
2,what's wrong with film studies,"This book has no higher mission than to keep its nose clean: it has no argument, no vision of British cinema, just a lot of fashionable covering-of-bases to protect its vacuity. When it stoops to an actual film, the reading is staggeringly flat. I suppose it is meant to be sold to undergraduates somewhere or other, but need they be treated so demeaningly?"
4,exceptional worldly jade book,"Extremely great book on the subject of jade. Book even includes the very rare today ""Wyoming Jade""...should be a book devoted to that subject."
4,......for car emergency,Gave as a gift for son and daughter. Came...2 in a box.I tried one with the charger and it indicated it was charged.I like the idea of a car and AC charger.....and plug in via cig lighter if needed.Dual --flasher and LED flashlight.good to haveTime will tell.Cheap insurance if they function when needed.The key is to make sure they are always kept up with a good charge.
5,Fun!~,These little babies are really great! They are both great binoculars and camera- great for bird watching! Or.... anything else you choose to use them for- inexpensive for what you get -
2,bad fit,"For the price, this camera s pretty decent. I took a few pictures with it and they came out decent, The only real gripe I have about the this device is the way it was designed. I can not get it to properly fit to my face so that I am looking out both scopes at the same time. Due to where the camera sits there is not enough room for the user to adjust the width or the binoculars. Either you will end up looking through the right scope or the left but never through both. Unless your head is wide enough. I am impressed with the clarity of the view. Which is crystal clear. If I was able to get it to fix properly, I would have given it 3 or 4 stars."
2,Meade Capture View,"The binoculars are actually pretty good, but the digital camera is the worst I've ever seen. I can't believe they would put such a lousy camera in a name brand product."
2,Meade Capture View Binoculars,This is a very good pair of binoculars with a very lousy digital camera attached.
2,SAD,"Internal timer with no controls? No 'OFF' switch. Turn it and take pics...great. As long as you keep taking pics all is well.If you loose track of the 2 minute window..it turns off! RATS No way to extend the 2 minutes? Looking thru binocs you have no hint (is the camera on or off?)PROBLEMS:1) Internal timer-that can be fixed with a firmware download but if you extend the timer to 30 minutes..ya can't turn it off.Well you can by removing the battery cover. And that's another problem.2) plastic battery cover.A toy .Not long for this world3)no cover for memory slot or USB port or lens covers (5)4) Beeper? What beeper? I can't hear any beeper.5) Battery labels? + and - are confusing for first timeJust turned it on,took one picture..it turned off. Turn it on, take another picture,set it on the counter..it turned off??????Grrrrrrrrr"
4,Excellent product with good summaries of key ideas,The book provides a quick review of key ideas and events in world military history. A good buy!
3,CUTE BUT BEWARE OF SHIPPING!,"The material is thinner than it looks in the picture and runs large. My dog weighs 11 lbs but her usual small size was about three inches too large around the body. My main complaint is the shipping method. I ordered this dress and the biker one. The biker one did not say ""back order"" but they sent it separately. The biker one was on sale for $5.95. However they shipped it not only separately but in a box 15 times too large, stuffed with wrapping paper, and charged me $8.95. I don't dare exchange the dresses for a XS for fear they will send them in a crate strapped to a camel! PS: The biker one is adorable!"
1,It's only Rock n' Roll,"This is, without a shadow of doubt, the worst book on Rock n' Roll that I have ever read. I am suprised that it is still in circulation. It is full of errors of both a technical and research nature. Mr Brothers, for example, completely misquotes the Black Sabbath song 'Paranoid', as well as many others.The grammar is shocking and the authors inability to understand context reveals him to be a man of limited musical comprehension. Add to this the fact that it is grossly out of date and you have yourself a real shocker."
2,Never again,"The display looks good, but it really isn't what i expected. It was hard to construct to the point i didn't use it. I wanted to use it as my secondary one for traveling, but it was not travel friendly. I have to screw in sections to build it together, where as my other one had latches and fit right into the other sections. It does come with a travel bag, but who wants to use it if it takes 20-30mins to build, or take down."
4,WONDERFUL!!!!,I have seen this video a couple of times now and it is just wonderful. Being from Australia I have always had a fascination with New York which is what tempted to watch this video in the first place. It is great!......I loved it!
2,Disappointed,"This is the first item that was very disappointing. The diamonds do not have much sparkle, actual cloudy and they didn't even look the same size. Had I had more time, I would have returned them. The color and clarity ratings were definitely incorrect.Anne"
5,Great Soap!,"I like this soap a lot, don't know about the defatting but it smoothes you skin and it is good for stretch marks and cellulite."
2,Completely outdated!,"considering the 1999 Declassification Project by the U.S. gov. yielded 24,000 never before seen documents on Chile from 1970 on, many of the issues concerning the Allende & Pinochet years in this book are outdated and come off as uninformed. Get The Pinochet File by Peter Kornbluh instead."
2,Outrageous shipping!,"Yes, the lites work, but you pay 3 times the cost of the lite for shipping! (for EACH lite bulb!)Same rip as other lighting companies on Amazon. It's cheaper to buy at your local hardware or box store!"
1,looks and smells like dog food,"i bought this at walmart for my son who is very picky with his food, but will at least give things a try. he put this in his mouth, chewed, made a grossed out face and was holding it in his mouth with his mouth opened looking at me like he was going to cry. i finally smelled it and i couldn't get myself to try it, because it really didn't smell plesant. i tossed it in the trash."
4,this book is a time-saver,"Written with simple language. But technically detailed.Everything of described within can be found on inet in forums, etc. But it takes only a couple of evenings to read this book instead of weeks of googling."
2,I wish...,"I WISH THAT I HAD LISTENED TO SOME SELECTIONS BEFORE BUYING. I REALLY ENJOY DELIUS' MUSIC..BUT, THIS IS A POOR CD AS TO ""HEARING"" DELIUS' LOVELY MELODIES; INSTEAD, IT IS HIS WORKS BURIED BY SINGING."
5,Its a cable,"What's there to review? Its a USB extension cable. It does exactly what its supposed to do; no more, no less, no problems."
4,Good for handbook for golfers,I found the book easy to follow and motivational. It shows the salient elements of getting fit to play golf. The best feature I found was the diagnosis he offers. If it hurts here after a round of golf do this exercise. I used to get a pain in my inner thigh that I got rid of by doing the prescribed exercise every second day for three weeks. While I haven't read every book on the market I found this one satisfied my requirements so I didn't look further.
5,FABULOUS!!!,I needed a polisher at work...one with power. And this has it. It is exactly what I needed at a great price!!!!
4,"Graphic, yet informative...","I enjoyed Deviant from Harold Schechter very much, and having read Fiend and Deranged, I can easily say this is my favorite among the three (he has also written 2 other books, Bestial and Depraved, if you didn't already know). Although I would have liked a more detailed description of Gein's childhood, I thought the book was very graphic yet informative, and was an enjoyable book to read...and even learn from. Although the subject of necrophilia may not be everyone's cup of tea, Schechter did a good job comparing the Gein case to that of several other historical cases...A must read, overall..."
4,Not A Compilation,"2 Milt Jackson Savoy sessions from the mid-1950s on 1 CD. Frank Wess flute or tenor saxophone on OPUS DE JAZZ, Lucky Thompson tenor saxophone on JAZZ SKYLINE. Hank Jones was the pianist on both. The Jackson - Thompson session produced another album - JACKSON'SVILLE"
3,Great Airbrush but misleading picture.,I love the Paasche VL airbrush. This is the second one I've had. The first lasted for years until it was lost in a move. It feels very comfortable in your hand and sprays all paints even cheap acrylics cleanly and evenly. The only problem I had with this purchase is that it didn't include the 3 oz. bottle that is shown in the picture that was also included in the last set I purchased. It would be 5 stars but for that.
5,Simple Bang for the Buck,"Got to admit, a great product! I've got a great Home theater system, but these are superb for the PC! Nice sound for games, music, and the like. Nice option to hook-up to TV for bedroom, or other area of home."
2,"Very very bad design. They sound terrible even for $75, that I paid.","First of all, I want to say that I have been having these speakers for more than a year in past.First, it's the most ridiculous design I have ever seen. Didn't notice that when I was buying unfortunately.Cons:1) Mid-range speakers are pointed downwards (???). Question: W T F ? Of course you can expect lose of mid range frequencies because of that.2) you might think because these speakers have 2 tweeters each, the high freq would be nice.. no way, they managed to fail even here.3) Subwoofer is simply terrible, the worst I have ever experienced actually.These speakers' ""red"" price should be $30. IMHO.Now I am a happy owner ofKlipsch RB-61 II Speakers, of course this is a different price range. But just wanted to suggest for those who can afford. These are the best speakers I have had so far."
3,Rent before you buy!,"Not enough can be said/done to educate the casual reader about Fado/Amelia Rodrigues within the confines of a review. Thus, let's proceed with the rationale for giving this DVD only 3 stars:This is a live recording from a concert Amalia Rodrigues gave in the '80's in Japan. The image doesn't seem to look well on the traditional TV's aspect ratio. Japanese captioning adds to the sense of frustration of the non-Japanese viewer. Amalia's performance is rather ordinary, and camera work and sound are barely acceptable as presented on the disc. If the producer of this DVD had done more than to transfer from a Japanese master video tape straight on DVD it would be too bad for his effort since it doesn't show.Too bad for those who approach(ed) this edition with an above-average sense of anticipation; disappointment looms around..."
2,Awful experience- Don't buy from Winsome Wood,"Don't buy this island! The wood is high quality, but the quality control is AWFUL. Parts kept arriving broken and needed to be replaced, no less than three times. Finally when we thought we had all the pieces unbroken, we put it together only to discover that a piece we thought was fine was actually cut too small! So, after a month of dealing with Winsome Wood and their ""fax only"" part replacement process, I gave up. I am now the owner of a lovely kitchen island with a missing back. So it's against the wall. I AM furious, but I have a one year old and I simply don't have the time to be on hold forever with this company, find and fax more paperwork, or take apart the table to insert the missing piece.It's a shame, because if people at Winsome Wood would simply pay attention to their jobs (quality control and packaging), it would be a great quality table."
4,"Good for the money, but a few issues.","As mentioned over and over, there will likely be one broken part. Mine had the same small 'crush' seen in the user photos. I was able to glue it and it looks okay. If they know this is a common break, they should package accordingly. Also, the plywood panels are 'printed wood grain'. It's not overly noticeable, I just don't like it. T he rest in good, pretty natural wood, the plywood should be real as well.As for the complaints on assembly instructions, I found that if I made sure I inventoried and identified all the pieces before I started(there are on or two that would be easy to confuse), assembly was EASY. And they even have an inventory list and tell you to do this!Once assembled, it is a sturdy, good looking table. And the wheels are exceptionally strong. Most other tables use plastic, these are metal with bearings! I'd buy again."
3,It (...was bad)..,"im sorry but i though that there would be more to the book than just what happens to perfect little superstar brit who hardly ever does something wrong... i thought there would be more of a point or drama to the book than just ""when brit was 4 years old she was already singing.."""
1,This Book Lacks Depth,"I was hoping to get a more in-depth book about Britney whom I've been a big fan of since she started out. Though this book does give some good insight into Britney the woman, I would have liked more."
2,Talk about cheesy,"I thought it might be fun to read a book about Britney, but this was terrible. They should have taken more time writing in stead of squeazing that in between performances. Basically the most of the book is sickeningly sappy. To give them credit it isn't too conceited and Lynne seems to have some good advice, but overall its pretty much common sense. She should have waited another year or two before releasing it. It would have been good if there were a tiny bit more depth than this. I advise you stay away."
1,"It""s a great book to read",this book is about britney and her family and how she grow up so i think it's a good book to buy and i look forward to hearing from people about it and what you think the book is. it's not just about her and her family it's a lot more then that i well not say anymore to you people go out and get it see ya britney spears your single for your upcoming new album it's good iam going to get the new album when it comes out and i have the other one you mad lastyear see ya britney spears
4,Good encyclopedic reference on Backtrack,"I found the book to be quite useful. It's easily understood and can be easily digested by a beginner.If you are looking for a tutorial on pen-testing, this is not it. This is an encyclopedia on various pen-testing tools which are found on a Backtrack CD. You can use it as a reference, but I wouldn't recommend it as a textbook on hacking. One regret is that it describes an older version of Backtrack (before 4) so some of the newer tools are not covered. But nonetheless, I've often referred to this book to get useful insights into some of Backtrack utils.[...]"
3,Skimping on storylines,"If you enjoy Speed Racer, this is an essential part of the series to have as a die-hard regardless. However, most of the episodes are only one part episodes. They wrap up much too quickly. I say get the other volumes if you like the multi-part episode series. The two-part storylines are needed to make a good plot and development. There is only one two-part series on this DVD. And the collector's car isn't anything special to look at. It's just a neat little bonus to have I guess. If you want a better looking model car, Johnny Lightning brand is the ticket if you can fine one."
4,I wish I had this car 35 years ago !,"I agree with the other reviews regarding the limited number of episodes, but rather than give us 16 episodes on the last disk, they decided to stretch it out a fifth and last year. They should have reduced the price. The die-cast Mach V was a nice touch and I do wish I had it when I was a kid and the show was on TV, and I could really enjoy it. But to another reviewer's point, the back wheels do not move as easily because it is a pull-back car....you pull back on the car, the wheels wind up, and then you let go...the car moves on its own.I also am giving the DVD 4 stars due to the limited number of episodes, but like all Speed Racer episodes, the content rates 5 stars.Go Speed Racer, Go !!"
5,Fast and Absolutely Intense!,"Hardwick, is one of the few black authors out, today, that gives you what readers are truly looking for- ORIGINALITY. His books are fast, suspense driven, eventful and the twist and turns in each are unpredictable, so much so, that you eagerly turn page after page anticipating the next move. I thoroughly enjoyed, Supreme Justice. I felt obligated to purchase Double Dead and was just as pleased. His style is like a gush of wind on a wintery night! It wakes you, enegizes you, and startles the mind ! I can't wait to read his next effort."
5,Strikingly Done,"This is the second book of Mr.Harwick's I have read. He is right on. I was raised in Detroit and he certainly hit the conditions and feelings of the city, sad to say. His list of characters was great and the plot never slowed. I will now continue to read all of his Novels. I would highly recommend this one."
4,Great Book,"I am a member of a book club and my job is to find quality books, for the club to read. We had never read anything by Gary Hardwick, when I heard him promoting his book on the Tom Joyner Morning Show. I'm so glad that we decided to read this book, because it's truly one of the best books that our club has read. The book has it all, a murder with a twist, an unlikely friendship, feuding brothers and a marriage with real problems. (Just to name a few!)It's a page turner that really keeps you guessing, while entertaining you. Who needs ""Law & Order"", ""The Practice"" & ""NYPD BLue"", when you can read SUPREME JUSTICE!My only problem with this book, is that I read it to fast. So, I guess I'll have to do a little research on some of his other books, to present to the group."
2,Good Plot ....but lacked detail,"I have mixed feelings about the book. My overall rating is 2.5 out of 5. I think the author had a very good storyline with several plots going on simultaneously. This made the book very suspenseful. However, I believe the author had two weaknesses (1) I do not believe the author was descriptive enough when writing the love scenes between the Mashall and his wife. In other words, the author lacked depth in describing the romantic aspects between the husband and wife. There were parts of the book where it clear that a man is writing.The author should be able to describe the scene so that the reader can feel the scene whether they are male or female. (2) The vocabulary used was not challenging and at times seemed too simplistic.However, overall I think the book was provoking enough to keep my attention...I read 200 pages in one day!"
3,Too much detail,The book is over 800 pages and while the research seems through it is a hard read as one experience after another with many similarities described. I found myself skipping parts to get to the meat of the book. Seems very well documented.
5,I found Gilbert's book particularly tough going,"I found Gilbert's book particularly tough going. At times it becomesa seemingly endless list of atrocities committed by faceless Germans,Ukrainians, Poles and others upon the Jews. Its narrative style is""matter of fact"" and unemotional, which if anything makes it an eventougher read. Anyone who picks up this book is unlikely toexpect anything less than a very disturbing read,this book gives you that and more. My onecriticism of the book is that at times it appears anecdotal, due tothe authors attempts to describe the fate of individuals.This is a near impossible task given the intended scope of the work.For me this detracts from what is otherwise animpressive book."
2,All reviews must have been written by the author!!,Not a good book for technique and selection of illustrations. Much must be considered in colored pencil and I learned nothing from this book. Thanks
5,Great Buy,"I'm very happy with my new tripod.It's good & sturdy and has a few extra features that my older tripod didn't have.Plus, the price was much less than I expected."
4,"Solid tripod, good value for money. Many features make it useful in all situations","Happy with purchase as what was promised was delivered. All around tripod will get great use for great price. May upgrade eventually to high quality, lightweight, but not until the activity goes backwoods and the much higher expense proves necessary."
3,Cheap crank handle,"I've had this for a few years and it's given me mostly good service. I only use it in a studio to photograph art, so no rough treatment or lugging and banging around. The plastic crank that raises and lowers the platform the camera attaches to has had a small plastic piece broken off that causes the handle to pop off of the tripod when you try to turn it, necessitating grabbing the top and pulling it up/pushing it down by hand before tightening the ring that holds it in place. I've also replaced the quick release platform for the same reason: breaking off of small plastic parts. If you're more professional, I wouldn't count on this for something that's expected to take wear and tear."
1,Needs a better locking mechanism on the legs,"Used this tripod 3 times and by the fourth use one of the locking mechanisms to hold the leg from sliding up and down just kept popping open by itself and the leg would slide.The tripod is very sturdy when it worked the first 3 times, unfortunately they overlooked this flaw in the locking mechanism.I would stay away from this. I'm not sure of any other mechanism to lock the legs in place as i have not looked that extensively into other models yet.Maybe i just had a faulty as it seems everyone else gave it good reviews. Would be interested to see if anyone else had this problem."
2,Disappointing Birthday Gift,"I ordered this tripod as a gift for my son. It arrived promptly and seemed to be in good shape so I did not remove it from its original container. When my adult son opened the package he observed that the crank handle seemed fragile and its mounting appeared cracked. By later in the day it had fallen off! I was very embarassed, as I thought I had purchased a quality gift. I was wrong. My son was polite and said it would work OK, but I'm looking for another product to replace the cheap poor quality gift that I provided him. Maybe I should shop elsewhere!"
2,R8169 chip based cards stopped working with this Switch,"I've yet to figure out why, but a couple of months ago my computer lost all network access when talking with this switch until I change to 100MB, and even then that wasn't consistent. Same reaction to both ports on my PC. I haven't added anything to the switch to cause this trouble, nor have I used new drivers. The switch must have gone bad (bought less than a year ago). Others on the net are having similar troubles. Sad."
1,Great for a Month - Then Giga Part Died,"This thing worked great out of the box. Bottom says v2.1There was no noise, heard no fan like others discussed.Today I noticed that all the computers hooked to it had dropped to 100 Mbps. I did a bunch of solo debugging, then got Linksys on the horn. They determined the same as me, it is in its death throws at 1 month. 10/100 works but for some reason the gigabit quit working. So now it is as worthless to me as the other collection of 10/100 switches that I parked in the attic.Oh, and now I'm having trouble finding my receipt in my pile of techie receipts so looks like I wasted $80 on a 10/100 to replace my 10/100 so that my video studio computers could communicate quicker with each other and the video storage NAS'.Bah!"
1,Do not buy this.,"I purchased this unit for a remote area of our offices to replace an older 100Base-T unit. It slowed the area to a crawl. Testing showed that traffic was flowing at 1/3 the speed of the old unit. I have been trying for the last week to return the unit, but PC universe does not reply to email and calls just go to a ""mailbox full"" message. Fulfillment of the order was good, but customer service is NON-EXISTANT."
3,Sweet romance,"This the first book I've read from this author, it was a sweet romance ending could of been a little better"
3,Chosen as the Frenchman' s Bride,There was too much conflict in this book. To start off so lovingly and then to have most of the book on conflict was n it to my liking.
3,E18 ERROR MESSAGE! SERIOUS PROBLEM CANON IGNORES! YOU ARE WARNED!,"I am changing my original review, unfortunately I can't reduce the number of stars accordingly. After owning this camera for seven months (admittedly it takes great pictures) with no warning the lens no longer extended and I got an ""E18"" error message. I did not drop the camera or otherwise abuse it. It turns out this is a serious problem that has affected thousands of Canon users on dozens of models over the last few years. There is even a class action lawsuit. I am sending the camera in for warranty servicing but based on other consumer's experiences my hopes are not high as Canon tends to blame the consumer rather than admit they have a serious problem. So do yourself a favor and Google ""Canon E18"" before buying this or any other Canon digital camera."
3,S80 Discontinued....Now look at the much better Canon PowerShot G7,"As a suggestion...take a look at the newly released Canon G7. More features, faster operation, better optic lattitude and sells for about $520."
1,Old and in the way,"Why clog up the site with obsolete equipment from years ago? This might have been a good buy in its day, but it's way past it prime now. Unlike classic film cameras, there's little point in old digital stuff."
2,Not worth the price,"I bought this camera based on glowing reviews by other owners. I don't agree. This camera is cute. It has a really nice screen and controls. The fact that it has a wide-angle lens was a big plus for me as a realtor. However, the picture quality stinks. I have to spend forever with Photoshop to try to get the photos to be acceptable. In the end, my little cheap Minolta Dimage X that I've had for years, takes MUCH better pictures. Sadly, I found out too late."
1,I never received the camera!,I would love to review the S80 Canon Powershot digital camera but I never received it!
2,The Canon E18 error,"I bought the canon S80 a year back. During the new years party yesterday i got the E18 error. The lens won't retract or extend after this. After researching this error, i am pretty annoyed about it. In nutshell, the camera is as good as trash now. Listen to the other reviewers and at least search for ""canon E18 error"" before you buy any canon camera. On the positive side, this camera took good pictures till it worked."
3,Not Happy,"I purchased the kindle edition of this book and I must say, I was very disappointed. The test are interesting and enlightening but in the kindle edition I was unable to read some of the test. I suggest if you want to buy this book, order the paperback version."
3,Fan died after 2 years.,"Installed in an older Pentium D Dell XPS400 that had a 300 Watt PSU that had also died. The Antec worked very well until the fan decided it did not wish spin any longer. FWIW,this machine had very rarely been been turned off. Thankfully it was still under Antec's 3 year warranty. Moving parts do die."
2,Emits Noise,"This unit emits a high-pitched electronic buzzing sound when the computer is running. It's not loud, but it's right at the frequency range where it's annoying and hard to ignore. I tried two different units and both had the exact same problem. I did a little searching and found other reports of this issue, so it's not just my setup. This is very unfortunate because other than the buzzing sound this unit works great, runs cool, and the cooling fan makes almost no noise. This would have been the perfect unit for my purposes, but because I am in a quiet home environment and can't endure that buzzing sound I have to look for something else."
5,Great power supply,"I bought this power supply after I had the cheap one that came with my case go out on me. This thing is rock solid and has never failed me. It has plenty of cables for anything that you need, I have a large case so they long and many cables were great. Another plus is how power efficient this thing is. I recommend buying this power supply and foregoing a cheaper one as the cheaper ones usually go out after a short period of time or are not very stable."
5,Essential reading for potential home buyers.,"I wish that I would have read this before I brought my home. All the facts and things that you need to know, written from the point of view of the actual homeowner, and not the industry beneficiaries, who are looking to cash in on other's ignorance.If you are considering buying a house in a homeowner's association, and you do not know what CAI stands for, I strongly suggest that you read this book. Because if you do not educate yourself prior to buying, I can pretty much guarantee that you will be ignorantly donating your hard earned money to the CAI without even knowing it.Don't take my word for it, read the book. It's a small investment to save you from years of potential misery at the hands of a few property managers and collection attorneys who know very well how to help themselves to communities reserve funds while your money is in the hands of a few ignorant board members who will gladly give it all away in the name of power.An essential read."
4,A very extensive list of Egyptian expressions,"This is a huge resource for students of the Egyptian dialect. A lot of the expressions are not that common (seeing as there are so many). Also note that all the expressions are in Egyptian and not modern standard Arabic. The book is extremely diverse, some of the phrases are proverbs from the Quran and yet others are vulgar phrases you might hear on the streets of LA. A definite buy for a non native speaker of Arabic going to Egypt."
1,Hella Gar-Bage!,This cd sucks homie don't even waste ur money just watch tv or listen 2 the radio 4 laffy taffy other than that they deserve no hype or deal!
1,Is there anymore tickets for the 1 star train?,"I agree with everybody that hates D4L. Actually I am a fan of anybody who hates D4L because they listen to good music. D4L is a BIG disgrace to hiphop and 'Laffy Taffy', 'Betcha Can't Do It Like Me' are amoung the worst songs. Don't waste your time with this at all. This CD shouldn't have been released to the public ears. Needs work...MAJOR work."
2,typical rap......money....cars......women.....sex,D4L is no diffrent than everyone else.. they all sound the same they all hop around the same.. they all act the same.....if u watch a rap video there all the same...one is in a suv on big rims... ugly girls in lil shorts .... wavin 100 bills around ....and they all got big ball caps on and sun glasses and pants pulled around there butt crack.. laffty taffy has to be the gayest thing ive ever heard.
3,Itz aight,"I gotta agree with everybody else on here about the lack of decent lyrics but there are some tight beatz up on this album. Laffy Taffy ain't all that but tracks like Bankhead, Can't do it like me and others make up for it. If yo lookin for somethin to bump to I'd recommend this CD but if it's lyrics and talent u'r looking for, pass this one up!!!!"
1,Are You F***ing Kidding Me?!,"Why? Why in the hell would ANYONE buy this type of stuff? Even to dance to. This album isn't good for anything. Why the hell would you buy it? Just... why? This... this isn't even crap... It's below that. This album doesn't even deserve a 1 star. I'm wondering what deaf ears are enjoying this... There is not one good thing I can say about this group. Overnight success is about the only thing... and I'm wondering just how in the hell that happened. This album, no, this group needs to be thrown in a junk pile. What happened to good music? ANYBODY CAN BE RICH IF YOU CAN PUT STUFF LIKE THIS OUT AND GET PAID OVER A QUARTER!!! I'm serious, if these cats can go platinum, Mentally ill children can too."
2,Are you serious,I could think of a milloin things to spend $15 on and this album is not one of them. I was sadly disappointed with this album. Holla when it's gangsta
1,"Please, no.","Down For Life and whomever at their label that signed them and thought that ""laffy taffy"" was a good idea needs to be dunked in a tank full of piranahs, castrated and doused with gasoline while we all shoot at them with roman candles.They are the epitome of the outright suck that permiates the music industry these days."
1,a disgrace to hip hop,"There was actually a time where hip hop was above great and acceptable. Now after the deaths of 2Pac and Biggie (I'm not a fan of Big, but at least he had talent and great rhymes), hip hop should be called piece of s***. Thx to morons like Nelly, Lil Jon, DFB, Yin Yang Twins, Chingy, and a slew of others, I can't turn the radio without hearing such nonsense. D4L is no exception. ""Laffy Taffy"" is one of the most dumbest, unoriginal, overrated ""song"" ever. What is so great about this? Nothing. I haven't heard the album yet, but from judging from other reviews, I'm sure this is a horrible album. Where's real hip-hop? ATCQ, Public Enemy, Run DMC are examples of a great group. If you have a brain, please spend money on the artist I listed above."
2,Over-Priced,"after gettin over the sticker-shock, I HAD to put in the car right away, IMAGINE my disappiontment at the lyrical skills of this group, bangin bass thouI guess if you want to listen to BASS this is your Cd, If you want lyrics get some Eminem."
1,Doesn't work in the US,I am a huge Jim Carey fan and was so excited to buy this movie. It wasn't until it is home and opened that I realized it doesn't work on US DVD players. :(. Have a movie I can't watch. Disappointed
5,Great for kids who love dogs!,This was a GREAT summer read for my 9 yr old - she loves dogs and LOVED the stories of the shelter dog heroes! Nice format for this age b/c she could read all about 1 dog in a reading time block rather than have to come back to it day after day. Great stories!
5,Excellent Book!,"I loved this book! It was a quick, easy read but the stories brought tears to my eyes. Very well written!"
5,Songs to Remember,These are the wonderful kind of songs that you will remember and sing for generations to come.
2,not cuisanart,the picture is clearly a waring pro waffle maker and not cuisinart. I am wary to buy another waring pro because the one I have stopped heating after a year (maybe 15 uses)
4,Unusual orchestral exhuberance,"I am enjoying getting better acquainted with Hindemith as a composer.The orchestral work is satisfying and well-done.You can hear echoes of Mahler, Beethoven, and Brahms, and yet it is unique.The use of a large orchestra, with wide-ranging themes, is Germanic but also contemporary in its idioms.I cannot say I love it, but I find it stimulating and fascinating to listen to."
4,Good but not perfect,"I've owned this oven for over ten years. It is true that the heating elements warp but that has never affected the performace. What does is mine oven runs hot like 50-75 over temp. It took me awhile and a few burn dishes to think about putting a oven thermother in. Now I just turn the temp down 50 evertime and all is fine. I wish I could calibrate the temp. but was told it couldn't be done. what I really like about this oven which seems to seperate from the rest is the low temps, Mine has a defrost and a dehydrate setting. I find defrosting meat in the toaster oven does a better job than the microwave, especially on chicken. I'm also often drying things, not food, that have gotten wet. After ten years of service the timer finally stopped working, but online I able to buy a replacemnt timer for $17 so I did."
1,Horrible little gadget,Beware there are only about four channels on your FM dial that will pick this up and my area has broadcasts on all four - so its useless. Will return.
1,WILL NOT FIT 08-10 CTS,"Used the Amazon part finder to purchase this product for my 08 Cadillac CTS. When the package arrived it stated fits 03-07. Contacted the manufacturer and found out they stopped making this product after 07. Thanks to Amazon for making the return process easy and painless, however learned a valuable lesson. When using part finder make sure you check with the manufacturer first to ensure it fits your model year."
3,Classic Camp,"A well-made B-movie with a bountiful supply of nudity,lesbianism, and monster molestation. If this appeals to you keep reading: quality of the actors ranges greatly. The basic plot centers around the disappearance of women and the main character played by Tracy Keijster investigating the disappearance of her sister. Catholics be warned: contains material that could be offensive. Lastly, don't go expecting original screenplays or ideas as the director stated that he wanted to take a potpurri of his favorite films/scenes and create an homage of sorts."
5,Crittermom,A wonderful book about a sad part of American history. Highly recommend this book. Hope this little girl is resting well in Heaven.
2,Left me wanting more,"I should have read the subtitle closer - *HOW* to stop wasting our brightest young minds. If there was any indication of *WHY* to stop wasting bright minds, I slept right through it. If noone understands *WHY*, there's no reason to care about *HOW*."
3,Long on what's wrong and short on suggestions,"A better title would have been simply Genius Denied. The book is long on examples of what is wrong and short on suggestions about how to make things better.I don't think anyone involved in teaching or parenting the gifted is unaware that gifted kids are not reaching their potential; unfortunately, however, I don't think many of us have great ideas on how to improve things. I think we need ideas on how to improve things.I am eager to check out the website for the book. The website provides a list of books g/t kids love. That is my next stop."
1,No rant for Slant,"I did not enjoy this book. My recommendation to you would be not to waste your time with it. There isn't much of a plot. There are too many characters with no substance to them. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Finally, at the end there is the assault on Omphalos but it wasn't enough to suit me."
2,A Literary train Wreck,"Throughout the beginning of the book, I though the million different plots would eventually run together and be understandable. Wrong. I kept tellin myself ""it's slow to start, it will get good around page 100"" then it was 200, then 300, then the book was over.Not that all the plots were bad, I like the sentient computer and people sleeping their way to a better tomorrow, but some plots I didn't quite catch on. I even wondered why the techno-whore plot was included. I think it's part of the whole disturbing ""aren't i naughty?"" trend in modern SF, but that's a different rant.there were, however some good things about this book (hence 2 stars). the reactionary state of Green Idaho was an excellent concept and was underdeveloped. Also, the computer (whose name escapes me) had so much potential too, you could write a whole book on those things alone.In short, not too impressive. there's about five or six books trapped in here that keep bumping into each other and falling over."
1,dont buy,ok i bought this gun because of the low price thinking it would be decent1. it has no power i shot myself point blank and all i felt was a little sting2.it jammes way to much me and my freind were in war and they rush us i pop up and cap one with my mk23 and he stops but my freind goes to shoot and the gun jams he getts shot and we lost3.also during another fight i was using it and i shot and the top flew offHORRIBLE DO NOT BUY
4,good but bad,"This gun has a horrible paint job and looks really bad like its about to shoot 2 inches. Then when you shoot it, its really powerfull, and pretty accuate"
5,Saved me money in the first chapter!,"Loved this book! It saved me money, time, and hassles in just the first chapter.We travel a lot in our business and these ideas will really help me minimize the cost, while maximizing our comfort. Plus I learned lots of new, creative ways to make the most of all those frequent flyer/ frequent hotel clubs we belong to. It's a jungle out there!And I liked the personal stories, tips, and tricks about traveling first-class with a young family. On a reasonable budget! It will be great to offer these same kinds of amazing experiences to my own kids...Thanks Jay and Theo!"
4,Gemmell Is A True Find,"I came across Gemmell while trying to search down another author named James Silke (Death Dealer novels). Although Silke has written nothing else than those primal books I read years ago, I've found that Gemmell has stepped in to fill that void for me. Sometimes I feel that Gemmell's works lack the structure of the most lauded prose authors, but he more than makes up for it in pure characterization and his embodiment of a rousing, dynamic, fantasy yarn. His tales are a seamless amalgam of Tolkienesque high fantasy and Howardesque sword and sorcery. READ as much GEMMELL as possible. You'll be happier for it. In fact, my only TRUE complaint is that I can't seem to put a thumb on what SEQUENCE to read my Gemmell novels! Other Gemmellites agree on this one? :-)"
4,My first David Gemmell novel,"This is the first book by David Gemmell that I have ever read and I am more than pleased. I rarely rate books as high as four stars and almost never five. I am a pretty harsh critic.This is a terrific story, everything you could want in a fantasy epic...love, glory, honor, betrayal, hate and raw emotions. I have been looking for a good fantasy author for awhile now and have now found him. I plan on buying every last one of them.My only beef with the book is that it is too short. Another couple more hundred pages and my four star review would have been a five star one. A story of this magnitude needs to be longer and told in the upmost detail."
3,Spanish Workbook,"This Spanish workbook immerses you a bit too fast. They randomly throw words and verbs at you in no particular order. It's very confusing to someone who has no background in Spanish. Once you've already taken a little Spanish, it's a great workbook. But don't try to use it as your only guide."
1,COMMMENTS ON INSTANT IMMERSION SPANISH,EXCELLENT CHAPTERS WITH GRADUAL ADDITION OF NEW WORKS AND GRAMMAR. NOT TOO COMPILCATED FOR THE BEGINNER.
2,Recolored for your disappointment,"I can't stand the computer recoloring of the entire Conan series by Dark Horse. While anything past volume 4 is dubious to be reprinted at best, the slick gloss paper piles the ink up on the page making the art just seem garish, destroying any reason I have to read past Barry Windsor-Smith's run.Seek the now out of print Essential Conan."
4,For Garbage Fans only,"This was a pretty good cd. It is live songs from there self titled cd. The sound quality is alright. There are some repeat songs on here but they are from a different night of there tour. Its for true fans only though, and not worth the price of $47 that is being asked."
4,Whoever said introspection is a bad thing?,"On the surface, these reviews are nearly scathing enough to pronounce an impending doom of this highly original and genuine rock ensemble, especially since they attacked the dreaded ""sophomore slump"" head-on with their best endeavor yet (""Shine A Light""). I see this release as simply more insular and emotive than its predecessors. Whereas ""Shine A Light"" was more daring and eclectic, ""Tournament"" is sprawling and brooding, almost like a story that needs a climatic finale to make the plot worthwhile, but never actually comes to fruition. From a personal level, after being so enamored with their previous efforts, this is a welcome progression. Granted, it's not perfect and the quantity is substantially less, but the music is as triumphant, engaging, and mercurial as ever. Cheers to The Constantines on this fine album."
3,living language russian - basic-intermediate,"Great detail, but lacks needed exercises (text) and repetition (cassettes). I am disappointed in that regard and have learned more Russian from smaller, pocket-sized texts from other authors.Also, not enough conversational Russian. Sorry, but repetition (i.e., practice) makes perfect."
1,Absolutely Worthless,Let's see . . . throw a few dozen random words at someone. Make sure those words have nothing to do with each other. Expect that person to memorize them all. Start putting those words into sentences (which you throw at them and expect them to repeat in a rapidfire method) and expect your poor unsuspecting victim to not give up and throw the book against the wall!!!!!!This is NOT the way to learn a language. This series offers nothing but frustration. GO ELSEWHERE!!!!!!!
5,Best Camera Cases!,I have this camera case for my HP camera and it is by far the best case. It is really strong and the yellow insides help me locate small storage cards.
3,"Good contents, old book","The book was what I expected, however, the binding fell apart rather soon after I received it. I'm all for recycling used books but now I have peices of the book laying around."
1,I don't know about this,The reviews all say it works well. I am an avid diver and used this on two dives at the surface with small waves of less than 2 feet. Also at a Manatee snorkeling trip to Crystal River. Sorry NO GO.. water gets in and the purge valve at the bottom leaks. It is awfull. I went back to my basic Scubapro snorkel (old reliable) and I'm fine. Sorry this famous brand for me can stay famous in the closet collecting dust.
1,Destroyed my Critter,"The draw rod (the metal tube that draws liquid from a container) was just a tad too large. I didn't have the muscle to either remove the old rod or insert the new so asked my husband for help. With difficulty he was able to extract the old rod, then carefully and painfully tried to insert the replacement rod. Alas, the rod broke off after the first bit of insertion. That bit is now jammed in the unit with no way to remove it and my Critter is essentially destroyed. I would suggest that unless there is a reason, the original rod be left in place and just the tip--probably all that is really needed--be replaced. I'm not sure why a new rod was part of the kit, as it is just the tip that wears down and needs replacing. And it is always nice to have a new gasket."
1,Not the best Clarke,"As a reader has already so eloquently put it 'Gentry Lee sours Clarke'. I couldn't agree more. Admittedly, the original book had characters that were none too interesting, but I would much rather have an exciting story that moves along at a reasonable pace than read some character development for page after page. The rama series steadily declined after the original book, something which may or may not have been due to Gentry Lee's involvement, who can say. All I know is that by the time I got to the last book in the series (Rama Revealed) I was lucky to finish it. Admittedly all of the books have an interesting contribution to add to the whole Rama story but they get less and less enjoyable as you go down the series."
4,Boring! Not like Arthur C. Clake at all.,"I can't give it less than a 7 eventhough I hated it. I have to admit that it is still a decent book. (I couldn't have written it). It seems that Clarke spends more time nowadays trying to paint a picture of the future that is perfectly politically correct and devoid of any particular prevalent religion. That is fine, but I think he spends too much time on that and not on telling a good story. He will write 50 great pages on Raman exploration and then 50 on a particular characters personal life, complete with memories of their childhood and their philosophy. I agree with another reviewer below that said that this book seems to have been written mostly be Lee. I have loved Clarke and read his books for years and this one spins off track. Don't read it page for page. Be ready to skip over 20% of it"
3,It's not that bad; Good for those who really CARE,"The bottom line is, this book is good as long as you're one of those people who really enjoyed the first book and want to know what's gonna happen next. I would say that a LOT of the plot is complete ... and, sadly, many of the characters and subplots are completely irrelevent and unnecessary... Frankly, I could have written better. HOWEVER, once I reached the last third of the book, I honestly did find it very engaging and interesting. It was the first two thirds of the book that made it difficult to continue reading... Hope that helps some people when considering this book. I'm getting ready to read Rama III, so here's hoping it's better."
1,Overlong and boring,"This book is nothing like Rendezvous with Rama; it isboring, overlong and does not read like an Arthur C Clarke novel.It appears Lee did most of the writing and unfortunately it shows. My recommendation: Skip it."
2,quite disappointing,"I enjoyed rendevous with rama, and therefore thought I would like this book. No such luck. The writing is really bad and the characters are one dimensional. About 50 pages into it I realized that around 30 pages were missing from the book. I put it down, disgusted, but not disappointed. I'm glad I didn't waste my time finishing it."
4,Almost there,"I've read the original Rama many years ago, perhaps even when it was released in 1990, but still the story was fresh, deep in my mind, enough to keep me under Rama's spell. Still, this #2 sequel was quite dissimilar, unbalanced, despite being so interesting you can't keep your eyes off off it. There was this character developing concern, but if it offers you at least one or two plausible human beings on one side to the other you have two or three that could never be aboard the military spaceship or even be my neighbours!... Too many flashbacks of the 12th/13th or whatever centuries (! ) and that religious issue that somewhat unfocused our attention off God's marvellous creation: Rama! Looks like half of a book, half a story... needed more and more Rama, but still it's a very catchy tune overall. Onward to The Garden of Rama!"
1,What was THAT?,"A pile of soap opera dreck. The only book that I not only put down unfinished, but actually flung across the room. Did Clarke actually WRITE any of this?"
2,Gentry Lee Stinks!,This wasn't even close to what the first one was. I had to skip the the 1st 15 chapters they were too boring! But still read this.
4,"Really, It's Pretty Good...","I love Arthur C. Clarke, most of the time. I loved ""Rendevouz"", but felt that it was a little too austere. The sequels went the other way and I welcomed the change. I think blending a good character developer like Gentry Lee with a high concept genius like Clarke gives us the best of both worlds. I can't give it five stars because it isn't the best SF I've ever read, that goes to Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Mars Trilogy"". That probably tells you something about my biases."
1,"All Lee, no Clarke","This book and the sequels were clearly written by Lee. And it shows. The character development is too long and completely unnecessary in many instances. The villains are transparent. I was dissapointed that Clarke decided to sell out on his his brilliant RWR. It could have been so much more than this transgalactic soap opera. Do something else with your time, this book and the ones following this are not worth of your time."
1,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to this book, since I really enjoyed part one, but I wish I had read the reviews before I started reading it. This is nothing like the first book and does nothing to expand on the first book.Quite a bit of the book was spent on the characters having flashbacks. If the past lives of the characters were that interesting, then why didn't the authors make a book about that and title it appropriately, instead of selling me this book, misleading me into thinking it was to be about Rama? I was disappointed."
1,More of a soap opera than a sci-fi book,"Having read the first Rama book, I was looking forward to learning more about the Rama culture and technology through their second starship. To my dismay, the book was more like a soap opera between the human crew, with Rama taking a distant second in importance.In fact, it takes 1/3rd of the book before they even get on the ship, with almost nothing to show for it. Even after that, there are many boring conversations (almost unrelated to Rama) that that wash out the few islands of interesting reading."
4,Relive the Experience Over and Over!,"I saw La Nouba last July, second row, during my visit to Orlando, FL. How I felt watching this amazing show cannot be described with words. My only complaint was that there were WAY TOO MANY THINGS going on at once on that stage. I didnt know where to place my attention. I bought the DVD to remember this great experience, and with the hopes that I could appreciate the show better. Like some other reviewer commented, the editing is done very akwardly. The scenes switch from one to another so fast that I couldnt concentrate, hence my dissapointment came. The show itself is fantastic. The clowns are nothing but hilarious and the performers beyond perfect. This DVD is an amazing way to relive my experience over and over again!"
3,disappointed at the circus,"I adore these productions, but this one was a little flat. The acts were fantastic, but the clowns and other stuff that went on in between left a lot to be desired."
4,Great take along book.,I gave this to my hubby for Christmas and he is enjoying them. It's a great size for traveling light.
4,Safe and Tasty,"Our little grandson loves his Gerber Sweet Potato Puffs. Sprinkle some on the table before him and he'll immediately start grabbing for them and putting them in his mouth. I like that they dissolve so readily, making them a safe non-choking hazard. The taste is actually pretty good though to me they taste more like orange than sweet potato.My only complaint, and it's not a major one, is that there is more sugar in the puffs than sweet potato. Yet, with only one gram of sugar in a half cup serving, this minor sin is forgivable."
5,Gerber Graduates Banana Puffs,I love these. My daughter goes crazy for them. I have to make her stop from eating them all at one time.
2,"Very delicious flavor, the cream puffs with spices","Bananas taste very delicious cream puffs, after the openings have a very strong taste of the banana flavor, the taste is very light. The shape of a box in his pocket contained plum puffs, filled with very full.Amount to enough.Delicious strawberry apple."
5,luv it!!,"I really like this spatula. The silicone is only across the turning edge but no problem with it coming off-so far and I've had it 6-7 months. The rest is all stainless-which I prefer. I always enjoy shopping at Amazon especially on the products that have free S&H after the first $25.00. They also have an offer on a lot of products called 4 for 3. When you buy 4 products that qualify, the cheapest thing on the order is free. I always buy 4 items at a time and get 1 free, and then with free s&h it reduce my total by quite a bit. The last order I placed totaled about $78.00, but when I got the lowest priced one free($17.99)+ free shipping(12.95) I saved about $30.00. I always love a bargain and usually get one at Amazon. Don't think I've ever had to return an item either."
4,"Doesn't have the ""icky"" decaf flavor.. but great taste!","I'm usually disappointed by decaf coffees because you can taste immediately the icky decaf flavor... this one doesn't have that, it's actually quite good. Being from Italy, I was very familiar with Illy Caffe', which is also really good, but I was also pleasantly surprised when I tried their decaf."
5,Very cute story for teen readers.,"Fourteen-year-old Becca Howard made a miserable failure of herself trying out for the school production of ""Grease."" When she hears about the Pop Princess competition, it's not something she would normally go for. But when her friends dare her to enter, she has no choice -- and surprisingly finds herself really getting into it. She never thought she'd get anywhere -- and ends up getting to travel to London for the finals! But as the competition, and the practice for it, begin to take up more and more of Becca's time, she finds herself neglecting her friends. Can Becca have a chance at winning without betraying who she really is?I highly recommend this really cute book to teenage girls, who will enjoy the contemporary pop culture themes. Fans of Cathy Hopkins' ""Mates, Dates"" series will love this new series, ""Truth or Dare."""
3,A very narrow view on valuation with free cashflows,The book gives a good in depth review of the assesment of cashflows. But the main think it lacks is an indepth perspectief of the issues at hand.
1,Does not reflect the real-world techniques,"This is a typical example of how the MBA schools (like mine) ask students buy books written by McKinsey consultants when (not surprisingly), that firm is one of the companies that invests more in MBA schools... sounds suspicious?This book does not reflect the real life issues that professionals in Wall Street, face when performing a valuation. The links between strategy and valuation are very week exposed via a few kindergarten charts."
5,Buck for buck...the Best!,"I just found the original paperwork for my first CRITTER purchase, dated 9-27-95. So, I've had YEARS to see how this puppy works and holds up. It's extraordinary - period. I can't think of another tool of ANY sort that can compare with its intended use to cost to performance ratio. I have 3 units, currently, and have orderd others as gifts for family and friends. I'm kinda' retired, now, but, in my business years...if I couldn't have INVENTED this gem...I woulda' LOVED to have been involved with its marketing and sales - WITH - a piece of the ""action,"" of course! Buy it...and LOVE it!"
3,Simple recipes not simple ingredients,"Seems like many great recipes, but many ingredients that aren't found in the regular supermarket, especially if you live in a rural area like I do...so I haven't been able to try many of them."
4,Authentic Italian cooking,"This is a book consisting of many good recipes. However some of the ingredients are hard to find or know if you are not familiar with Italian cooking. Mario Batali's style is no nonsense, straight to the point. The recipes are unique, not the typical spaghetti dishes. A good buy for Mario's fans."
2,NG--Not Good,"I want a cookbook that is serviceable. I used B's holiday cookbook and this one several Christmas' back and spent A LOT of time both shopping for and preparing multiple courses. The first one (from the holiday book) was very good, and I was thinking, ""yes, I'm glad I bought both of these books."" But everything else I served--from both books--was just so-so. I'm a pretty good cook, and I can wing a lot and improve what I don't like, but I didn't find anything else in either of these two books that worked for me. It's just not the kind of cooking I enjoy, and other than a spark here or there, the recipes don't ignite."
2,Mario the Italian Wanna Be,"If you never grew up on Italian food or if you are not a Italian born, there's no way one can regognize the true authentic flavors of real Italian food. You can certainly try to immediate it, but its like comparing Leather to Pleather. I see Mario multi talented in his huge glossary of fancy words that describe history and perhaps description of foods in a high ranking cooking university. He is best suited somewhere in northern alps of Italy teaching Italian foods to the very elite and most sophisticated snobs who would be very interested in learning Italian Mario abstract-style and maybe paying a few hundred dollars for a fancy odd meal."
3,Fun to Look Through-Not as Fun to Use,"This book is enjoyable to read, but not as useful as I had anticipated. Many of the recipes just don't use ingredients that I can easily find or even care to use like rabbit, squab, pheasant, frogs' legs etc... That said there are some good, practical recipes-just not as many as I hoped for. I'm Italian and grew up around delicious homemade Italian food, just not the type of dishes Batali creates. Batali's recipes are indeed authentic, but not necessarily tempting. There aren't enough pasta recipes, but plenty of meat and seafood recipes in the book. Unfortunately this book spends more time on my bookshelf than in my kitchen. Try to look at a copy before purchasing this one."
2,"Good Chef, but the ingredients are to hard to find.","My husband and I love to cook, we watch the Food Network all the time. We love to try interesting food. If you have limited space in your kitchen, don't pick this one. Many of the recipes are the ""once a year"" type requiring too many unique ingredients. We've used the Emeril's and Naked Chef many more times, weekly. We're hoping that one of the other Mario cookbooks is a little less limiting in ingredients."
3,Informative but frustrating.,"This book offers an informative, but ultimately frustrating, look at the house-building process. Locke certainly seems to know what he's talking about, and in a perfect world, you'd be able to follow his advice and still come in under budget. In reality, you're likely to encounter contractor resistance (they're not all Lockian craftsmen) and a final cost that is a great deal higher than expected. If you're building a half-million-dollar house, or if you're willing to settle for a well-built 2BR cottage instead of the typically built 4BR Colonial you'd envisioned, you'll probably find this book invaluable. Otherwise, it might leave you vaguely dissatisfied, as you'll end up with a pretty good idea of how well-built your house is not."
3,Many good points but dangerously dated,"This book offers many common-sense bits of advice. I had some problems with the combination of the author's total self-assurance (do this, don't do that; this is good, this is no good) combined with the fact that this book is so far behind contemporary code that you could run into real trouble taking it too seriously. But he's writing for people who are watching the building process, not lifting a hammer."
3,Mistaken purchase,"Actually my 5 year old great granddaughter purchased this. It is one of her favorite shows. She does watch it, but I didn't purchase it on purpose...she accidentally did it. Still though it was a good choice. Had no problem with the video. Downloads so even a child can do it."
3,The fire's not real hot,"I thought the film was slow moving but absorbing for me. It's not for everybody. Reading the description makes it sound like these two crazed sisters set fire after fire causing death and destruction. No violence. No gore,etc.The sisters were interesting characters."
5,Some of the best Oaky,How can you describe Oakenfold?? A legend to trance music... I'll admit all of his stuff isn't that great (especially his newer stuff including Creamfields) but none-the-less Oakenfold brings a unique trance style that is unmatched by other mainstream DJ's. Global Underground OSLO is one of the best DJ mixes I have ever heard. If you want to have an intense night of dancing to some intense house-ish trance this CD is definitely worth it. From start to finish it keeps you engaged in the music - never a boring moment. The vocal trance that is also mixed in is the cherry on top (may be bias! - i am huge vocal trance fan).If you are an Oakenfold fan and want something better than Creamfields or Bunkka -- THIS IS A MUST BUY.
3,this record is the best in the year 98,"paul oakenfold is a one a best dj around the world,this record is cool because the songs are a mix from diferent countries,interesting............."
4,Good product but watch for slight of hand,"After much searching for a lighter, easier opening/closing ladder I found the CT416 at Amazon for the best price. Ordered one, got free shipping. It came in a battered Lt wght box and a corner foot was damaged. Had to return it. That was 3 weeks ago. Now it is nearly $50 higher plus paying freight. The photo shows two options but neglects to say you don't get them for that price (unless you scroll to the 'also bought' section). Still impressed with the ladder, just don't like the slight of hand game. Guess I'll do without."
3,The firs review is not reliable.,"I have not yet read this book, but I must indicate that the first review is not reliable. The Japanese writers he recommends are not scholars. They are so called commentators or popular writers."
4,Good Little Oven,"This little oven pretty much does it all: toast, bake, broil, convection bake. It can be used instead of a larger oven as long as you can fit what you want to cook inside - it is not much larger than most toaster ovens. The controls are fairly intuitive and seem like they will hold up well, however, the door seems somewhat flimsy and quite a bit of heat escapes through the glass."
1,23 Minutes of Luxury Hotels and Fluff,"This is NOT the only travel video on the Philippines, but it IS the worst. A lousy 23 minutes of fluff showcasing the most expensive resorts in Philippines and a fashion show nobody cares about. Only buy this if you have money to burn. By the way, it's on a recordable (purple) DVD not factory pressed. If you can find them, check out the Globe Trekker or Video Visits travel videos."
3,Three Generous Stars,Better than usual by these bottom feeders. Three good ones; guess which. Don't buy.
3,Need update,"I read this book finally. It's fun to read bio of Steve Jobs at this time. Since the book was published in 2005, I can't find anything about iPhone, which apparently is much much more successful than iPods. I think the authors need an update.From this book, you will know Steve Jobs was a bad-tempered jerk. But anyway, this is how Steve was. Man made mistakes.The other thing I learnt that Steve was lucky enough. He could have been a big loser on Apple, NeXT and Pixar. But how can I say? There was always someone to help."
2,Poor Plagiarism of Earlier Books,"Save your money. Buy used copies of Michael Moritz's ""The Little Kingdom"" and Young's earlier book ""Steve Jobs: The Journey Is the Reward."" Both are better written, are more accurate in important details and read less like ""The Washington Star."" And contain more than three-quarters of what you can read here.Steve Jobs *IS* an icon. He's also an egomaniac and a control freak. But no one can honestly argue with either his impact on both the computer and animation industries, or his success. A real biography of Jobs, one that provides insight instead of breathless titillation, still needs to be written.Any success for this book is Jobs' self-inflicted wound. Without his much-publicized efforts to suppress the book, this clinker would already be in the remainder bins. Recommended only for Apple Computer history freaks and as a student's example of plagiarism."
1,Waste of Time,"This is a poorly written book. It is biassed toward Steve Jobs and tries to be sensational by exaggerating some events. There are sentences, which are very unfair to Mr. Jobs.One third of the book is about Disney Corp. !! Why should we read about the fight in Disney Management in so much detail? It could have been explained in few sentences.The second act of Steve Jobs is poorly written. The stories are taken from magazines. The book doesn't inform us about the new management team at Apple and their relations with Steve Jobs. I am disappointed.Therefore, don't waste your time and paper. There must be better books about the second act."
3,"Good product, Bad Seller","I ordered the Palm Z22 4 days before Christmas and requested they send it in time to receive it by Christmas Eve. I was ecstatic when it arrived two days before Christmas. I was very dissappointed, however, when I opened the package and saw only the Palm Z22. No, directions, no manufacturers box, nothing but the item. The description on Amazon said it was like new and had all the miscellaneous things that it comes with when bought new. My wife was happy when seeing the Palm Z22, but it lost its luster when seeing there were no directions or anything else with it.The product works fine and my wife likes it. Just wish they would have included what they said they would. I paid $5 less than what it costs brand new."
4,Big helper,"This is a great product. I have wanted something like this for a while and have never owned a pda. This is very easy to figure out and use. Nice size. I use this for ebooks and it's great to take on trips instead of taking 5 or 6 full size books, just down load and read on this great product. It's fully compatible with mobipocket. My only complaint is that I had to return the one I ordered from Amazon. I wanted to use the ebook capacity for a trip and ordered it two weeks before departure. It still hadn't gotten there so I went to Staples and paid a little more but had it for my trip. For something that according to the computer was ""in stock"" I thought that was ridiculous."
1,Unfortunately this product didn't last,"Just like the review posted on February 22nd, I got my Z22 as a Christmas present from my family. It died 28 days later. Amazon quickly sent me a replacement which 4 days later had to be ""hard booted"" (see Palm on-line reference). Afterward the Calendar/Contact software got corrupted. I returned it as well."
5,Better Than Expected,"When I bought this entry level palm 2 1/2 years ago, I thought I would use it for a while and then move up to another more expensive model. I never have. It works great. It has had very few problems, and nothing that couldn't be fixed with a reset. When it does reset, it saves all my information anyway and only asks to reset the time. It charges in full in a short time with the wall plug, and I do that but once a week. It backs up to my laptop and syncs with my Microsoft Outlook. I bought the hard case, which has saved it from many falls. I also purchased the splash shopper and I love it. I have my grocery list on me at all times, and save a lot of time by not having to run home for it. When I am stuck sitting around, I play solitaire. I had no idea of the life expectancy of this product, but it has served me well."
1,Price way to high!!! READ THIS FIRST,IM SHOCKED...I rarely do this but....they should be ashamed of themselves by this price mark up! Go to PALM itself and the item is only $99.00
1,Obsolete in 2009 and It Breaks Easily,"Why on earth would anyone pay $300 for this obsolete technology? I bought mine a year ago and it's already broken. Now that I have a iPod Touch, I moved all my Palm contacts over to Outlook which the iPod Touch can access.This Palm Z22 is a useless piece of you-know-what."
4,Palm Z22 Redoux,"This is my second Z22. I guess I dropped the first one once too often (oops!). This one came with a silicone case to protect it from my lack of dexterity. Seriously, I like this product. It's easy to use and very versatile. Hopefully I won't need to buy a third one!"
4,Z22,"Z22 is smaller than my previous Palm Pilot (the Zire 22), but seems to be more reliable and has a clearer screen. I miss the options on cases, though."
1,Not able to hotsync with vista desktop,"I was not able to hotsync the z22 with my Windows Vista desktop computer, despite having downloaded the ""fix"" from palm support. I noticed someone else had the same problem, but the review was buried on page 4 or 5 of the reviews. I'd get another product if you have Vista."
1,Palm Z22 easy to use but not that useful,I received the Palm Z22 as a gift and was very excited to end my use of pocket calendars and slips of paper. I spent several hours entering in all of my contacts and inserting lists of things I wanted at my fingertips. I thought the time investment would be well worth the organizational payoff. You can imagine my disapointment when after only one week of Palm Z22 ownership my unit died. It would not even power on (yes I plugged it in to make sure the battery wasn't dead). I think I will look into getting a Blackberry instead.
2,Z22 Palm under expectations,After several years with a messy time organization; I decided that getting a electronic organizer; it could help and I bought a re-furbished unit.I have to say that couldn't get my goal since I found it is adding another step to this process; like dealing with batteries what exhaust quick; wires and so forth. I am not that kind of person. To be honest; I think screen is too little for over 40+ years old people; difficult to get used to writing symbols even with the keypad on the touch-screen. By the other-side buying a refurbished makes me return the first one because it didn't work and stall.
4,A good bit of functionality for the price,"While I'm not a huge fan of Palm's ""deal"" pushing in the Addit program - I'm a pretty big fan of most everything else. To its credit, Palm included neat little extras in Addit including free news from Reuters every time you sync. It's certainly not the NYTimes - but it'll do in a crunch. Addit (as of 12/18/05) also provides access to a few basic games including Solitaire which I'm sure, for some, might be a deal maker. But note that the included mix of programs and other content in Addit probably changes from time to time.As for the device - the basic form lends itself to use by relative novices in the PDA world, like myself. And this is exactly what Palm intended in the design and manufacture of the product. They succeeded admirably. I acclimated to both the physical handheld and the Palm OS in short order.For less than $100 - I doubt there's a better no-frills device on the market with so much to offer.M."
2,Not so good,I had the Z22 for 2 months before it crashed. I emailed Customer service and they were helpful. I did a Hard reset and all was well for a few days now it crashes about 3 times a week and I am going to send it in to Palm for serviceing but am buying a HP Ipac to replace it and will use the Z22 as a back up.I am not planning to buy any morePalm PDAs for a while.
3,palm Z22,"A handy PDA. Too bad the Splash software is not part of the product. I am used to the ""To Do"" list for various stores I shop at regularly. I add items as they come up and when I finally stop at that store, I quickly pick up those items and don't get home and think I wish I would have remembered that item.Nice compact size and very easy to use with Outlook."
1,It won't start after 3 months from purchase,"Palm terribly disappointed me. I bought a Z22 on late april this year and a couple of weeks ago it wouldn't start... and the warranty is for 90 days only... do they know that they broke down often after 90 days?! It is a big coincidence.As I've seen in Palm's support page it's kind of a common thing for this lame product to stop turning on. There it says ""We recommend you purchase a new Palm device."". Yeah right, as if I'll buy another Palm product!Lame product qualityLame warrantyLame support"
2,Disappointed.,"I have loved using the Palm Z22 for a number of years. When my old one died, I thought I could replace it with a used one. Wrong! This one is so old that it won't let me enter a date later than 2010 - so it's basically of no use as a calendar. Very disappointed with it."
1,Stranded Again,"Call me a glutton for punishment. When my first Palm died after a mere 12 months, I tried again. The second one lasted about 6 months. My thought is that the battery system in Palm is defective. And since you can't replace the battery yourself, you are out of luck when you can no longer reboot the unit.The handwritting option never worked at all on my first unit & just a little on the 2nd. If this is what attracts you to the Palm - don't bother.I did like the way it interfaced with the PC so you could type large amounts of information instead of using the stylus, but overall I am very very disappointed and will look for another company for my next organizer."
2,Small and limited,"I found the Palm Z22 small and limited compared to the other Palms I've used. Now that I'm retired I thought this smaller version of the Palm would be fine. But I miss the larger screen and capabilities of the Tungsten, and may end up going back to it."
1,Major problems attemptine to use the E book reader,"I bought it to be able to read E books but so far have been unable to nake it work. Nowhere is there any place that even list the E bookreader on it althought it show up on my computer, saying it will be installed at the next hot synk. Most of the space is a bunch of worthless games, with no way to delete them. It has proved to be as useful asa cheat note pad and a cheap calulator. JUNK!!"
3,Z22 meets expectations,"I went from an M500 to the Z22 and found the Z22 to be comparable with some positive and some negative differences.Positive: 1. Z22 USB connection is easier to use than the M500 cradle. 2. Z22 is smaller and lighter.Negative: 1. I've had the Z22 for about 60 days and I've had to ""Reset"" it at least 5 times. Problem is that if I let it time out rather than close it, the on/off button doesn't work - I have to press the reset button on the back. 2. Z22 Grafiti uses different characters than M500."
2,be aware,This is a good product but the battery life is not good...less then three weeks if not plugged in frequently.
2,Defective 3 times,"In all, I got 3 of these from Amazon--2 I purchased and one replacement. None of them would program. I was on hold with the Palm Service Center for an hour one day as they tried to walk me through the set-up process again. In the end I was told the problem I was having was common to this model--the date and year won't change from their default. I'm still waiting for a refund on the last one. Amazon made it easy to return and I appreciate that.I have an older model that I really like using. I think Amazon must have gotten a bad batch from the Chinese manufacturer."
4,One con to consider,"This is my first PDA and I've had it about a week. Mostly very happy. However, when you synch with Outlook it will only synch one Category for each Contact. This may be true for all Palms and may be fixable with a different synching program, but so far I haven't figured out a fix. A drag, since managing my Contacts was the main reason I got this."
1,Not worth the money,"I have this, I think it was $129 brand new. The problem is, the battery is hardwired so you can't replace it. I have to charge it after I do something simple like look up an address or phone number, the battery shows an immediate 50% loss in power. My old Sharp organizer from 1998 would still be working if it hadn't been dropped. Yes, this Palm Z22 is a great disappointment. Now I can't find anything from Sharp to replace it because they have been discontinued."
2,Product Life DISAPPOINTING,"My first Palm, Palm V, lasted 6 yrs before the screen crapped out...thought 6 yrs was great! And I developed a dependence on my Palm...if I had to choose between a cellphone & PDA, I'd pick the PDA, as it is my life.I then got a refurbished Tungsten which crapped out a week out of warranty. (Sorry Charlie)I then purchased this Palm Zire & after 2 yrs of decent use, the screen is unresponsive (even after following their suggestions on Tech Support). While the product served my needs, I have the expectation that I shouldn't have to constantly shell out money for a new one.I'm not sure what I will do next. Palm has certainly lost my confidence.As others have said, Buyer Beware."
1,Not worth the money,"I ordered this item because it was described as a quality gift basket that you could ""share"" with friends and family. And the reviews I read were outstanding. However, when I got the basket it was extremely small. It was smaller than my toddler's Easter basket! The food packages were so tiny that they could not be enjoyed by more than one person. Most of the basket was paper filler. The basket itself was slightly warped (not too badly) and the bow was made of cheap paper and was much smaller than that in the photo. I can't imagine how they justify charging this much money for something so small . . . not to mention the shipping! I was very disappointed. Thankfully, I had the item shipped to my house so that I could see it before I gave it as a gift. Needless to say, I ended up getting something else. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Not as advertised,"I foolishly purchased this photo album after reading the previous reviews. What a disappointment!!! First of all it came damaged. The last binder ring was detached from the album. The quality is pretty flimsy to fall apart that easily. One of the above reviews mentioned that it was beautifully crafted; I think thats stretching it. The picture above is of a glossy brownish/reddish color. Instead I was sent a white album that looks more like a notebook. I was better off purchasing a binder and adding my own refills. It looks pretty cheap but you get what you pay for. Funny thing is that after purchasing from this particular seller, I looked at other albums they have listed and noticed other reviewers mentioning that they are notorious for sending a poorer version of what is listed . Go Figure :0("
1,Product was not what I expected.,"I thought this photo album was the type to hold 8X10s in the slip covers, but it was just the standard magnetic page photo album. This should have been clear in the description, but it was not. I over paid for this considering you can get this type of album at the local Walmart for about $5. The shipping was outrageous on this item as well. I paid more because I thought I was getting a premium product."
5,Great addition to my Ranger Crew!,I ordered two sets of these for my ranger crew. I just ordered a third set They are built well and do their job. When you pull really hard on them it feels like it may break (I am a big guy) but no breakage and has helped distribute weight on several occasions that could have been very dicey and great to hold onto. Highly recommend and the price is great! They come in pairs!
3,Bought two and one leaked at the swivel after about 4 days of snorkeling,"Bought two of these for my kids for our trip to St. John, USVI. After about 4 days of snorkeling one started to leak at the swivel. Swivels on snorkels are probably not a great idea in retrospect. The other one is working fine at this point. A little disappointed but the place we stayed had extra snorkels so we didn't lose out much luckily. Would probably *not* buy another of these but would buy the version that has the corrugated tube (which I own, an old one without the swivel, and has never failed me)."
2,Disapppointing,""" A Song of Lunch' is a terribly sad waste of acting talent--Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman star in this attempt to bring to life a pretentious poem about a couple once intimate who have gone their separate ways for a dozen years and now meet for lunch in a restaurant they used to enjoy when they were together. It is a study of age and change and loss; the man in particular has never recovered from the the breakup of this relationship. Poignant though it is, the man is so determinedly narcissistic that he corrodes any sympathy the viewer might otherwise have developed. Except for the luminous Emma, there's no reason to watch--poor Alan Rickman gets to do noting but look semi-conscious for an hour."
5,Wonderful for your hair and smells good,"I enjoy using this product. It is just what I have been looking for in a hair conditioner. Less tangles, makes my hair soft and smooth. It is the best and coming from a grandma over 55 that says alot. I have long hair to the middle of my back it is curly hair that gets tangles everyday.Now when I comb my hair it doesn't break off and I loose less hair. Thank you for creating this wonderful hair conditioner."
5,Truly Enjoyable,"It is Harry Pearson of The Absolute Sound that I must thank for turning me on to the music of Sir Malcolm Arnold many years ago through his printed recommendation of the composer's Symphony No. 5, which I purchased many years ago as an import LP and now enjoy on CD. Symphony No. 3 is an intense work that seems to look inward, while Symphony No. 4 is more outgoing, featuring a battery of percussion instruments that add propulsive punctuation to the musical text. Arnold's symphonies feature a unique blend of hummable melodies and intense, brooding passages. If you enjoy orchestral music but have never heard the symphonies of Sir Malcolm Arnold, you are missing out on something truly enjoyable. This Chandos CD is a good place to start."
2,timer problem,"This is our second round with the same oven. The size is convenient and fits toast or flour tortillas nicely. Toasting is great right up until the day you set fire to your toast. This day seems to occur about 6-12 months after purchase. The timer goes Kaplooey and forgets to shut off... in fact, the only way to turn it off is to pull the plug. On both occasions, we have been paying more attention to our children than the toaster. Not good.Would only recommend this toaster if you are a prisoner of style and space, and are willing to throw the thing out when you smell the charcoal."
2,Nothing Special Anymore,"Sadly, the new Piranha blades aren't nearly as good as the original designs. The original tooth profile with its curved inner surface produced such smooth cuts that you actually got ""shavings"" from the cut and not sawdust. They also cut much faster, especially rip cuts, than the new designs do.This current 18 tooth blade is essentially a ""disposable"" and has no standout characteristics at all. It's too bad, because the originals competed very well on the level of the Freud blades."
4,A Lighthearted Read!,"This was an enjoyable read but definitely not one of my favorites of Bauer's books. I loved A.J.'s passion for her photography and her relationship with her father, but I felt some of the other characters were a little too one-dimensional and not as fully developed as they could have been--especially Peter. It was a good storyline, but again, I don't think it was as fully developed as it might have been. It was a fun read, but this is probably my least favorite of Bauer's books that I've read so far."
1,Disappointing,"I liked Joan Bauer's other books (Squashed and Best Foot Forward), but Thwonk was no where near as funny or organized as her other novels. The main character, ""AJ McCreary"" was incredibly useless and annoying. All she does throughout the book is complain about how horrible her life is, and she always ignores other people's advice when they try to help her. At the end of the book, AJ doesn't change. The more I read the more annoyed I became. Overall, Thwonk is not worth reading."
4,So that's what happens,"At last I know what happens to a mosquito that bites the Count. I thought it just went on and on doing the same thing forever, but became harder to swat, being stronger and faster.Seriously, I'm under the spell again of Ms. Yarbro's words and character. The only problem I have is that just about everyone in the religious life is in it for greed or power, and more time is spent on one-upmanship by formality or insinuation than true piety. No one becomes a bishop or a simple nun for love of goodness. The only goodness usually found in the novels are that of the Saint himself who always gets victimized himself for showing humanity. Thanking a slave for service was the height of suspicious behavior. Could everyone have been that bad?"
2,"Same story, different time period.","I used to love Yarbro's St. Germain books. I devoured the first 8 or so. But after a while, I got tired of the perpetually persecuted vampire, who gets himself involved with a damsel in distress while fighting religious authority amid political upheaval.Although I tend to agree with what seems to be Yarbro's negative opinion of religion, this particular book -- in which stigmata is presented as a real phenomenon, without explanation -- was the final straw. It baffles me how one can condemn religion while at the same time showcasing one of its biggest frauds as being a real occurrence.As much as I love the historical detail she puts into her work, I wish Yarbro would write St. Germain in the present day. But then, her formula (see above) wouldn't work quite so well."
5,"If you want to learn C++ , especially games.......","This has to be the best book I have so far. Very easily to understand. He is in-depth about every line of code (you will never say ""what does that code do?"" All of the code on the disk works 100%. I recommend this to anyone wanting to learn C++, even if you have never used it. And a very big plus, if you need questions you can contact the author and he will help you out."
5,Great product for price!,"I recently moved to the US and so have been buying everything from scratch. I did a lot of research into good dining tables and eventually ended up buying the Cappuccino Apollo 5 Piece Dinette Set. I have to say, I'm really happy with it. It looks great and arrived very quickly, in good packing.Assembly was straight forward, although time consuming (I find Allen keys very frustrating as I'm quite capable of using a screwdriver).Overall, I highly recommend this. Despite being low cost, it does look very elegant and more expensive than the price would suggest."
3,Black Indie Films To Check For,"Thought provoking and definitely not for those with short attention spans, this flick is one to see if you like intelligent AND humorous black movies. Yeah, the production values aren't big budget hollywood but the story and good acting of the lead characters more than make up for it. Check this one out for something different."
5,"fun, psychedelic, and it rocks","Got to balance my negative review of their ""The Beat Goes On"" as I also got this LP this year and I love it! Very entertaining, good music, psychedelic 60s heavier (for the time) rock. I recommend it to any VF fan or one who's not familiar with them. Good stuff."
5,Flashlite FL 45i Monolight,"I love this item because it's inexpensive, lightweight, small and reliable. When my main light broke down I used my Flashlite FL45i Monolight and it worked beautifuly, it saved my day. Now I own 4 and I can use them as main, fill or backlight mounted on the Studiohut AC Flash Light Stand Swivel Mount with Umbrella."
3,"zombie fluff, but superior to the original House of the Dead","This is a good popcorn movie. Don't expect deep plot twists, emotional character developments, mind-blowing special effects, or any of that jazz. This is what sci-fi channel does best - Saturday night popcorn flicks with friends."
2,not as good,i liked the first house of the dead. house of the dead 2 on the other hand seemed to be a made for tv version . My personal opinion regardless of special effects/makeup which weren't all that bad . the story line was so so to poor.
2,she is a Continental Knitter....,"I really wish that I had known she was a ""Continental"" knitter. I'm just a beginner and I have learned/been taught to knit English and am totally confused watching her knit. I asked for (and was given) this DVD for Christmas along with some sock yarn for a couple pair of socks and I am so lost watching her knit........ I wish there had been something on here stating how she knits.. If you are more experienced maybe the different technique won't confuse you but wow....I'm lost. Very disappointed...I really want to learn to knit socks!!"
5,knitting korner socks 1,"since I got this book I have learned to make socks and have made many for gifts, what fun it is."
5,Circular Socks made easy,"I believe Nenah has created a great atmosphere and a good tutorial for making socks. Nenah has beautiful manicured nails and some Jewelry. This did not take from me learning how to make socks, neither distracted me. In SOck number one you make a sock at a time and it gives you one option of making a heel. Wait for Sock Number 2, which I think is a good DVD as well and you learn something different. I have never made socks until now, and I started right away. The resale of this item is good, it is a great investment in my opinion!"
2,Really pretty poor....,"The only things good about this book are the serial killing sequences. The author introduces so many different characters and side stories that it is not only hard to follow and maintain interest, but also very, very boring through many sequences. I almost stopped reading it before finishing the book several times, but decided to skim through it for the better parts and for the ending. BTW, the ending was pretty droll and predictable. I did not find myself emotioonally attached to any of the characters and really didn't care what happened to any of them. To me, this is the sign of a pretty poor piece of writing."
5,WOW!!,"I'm impressed! I thought by looking at the size of the book it would take me quite a while to read it. It did not. With each sentence, each paragraph, each page that I read I was pulled deeper and deeper into the story and characters. I found myself hating and feeling somewhat sorry for Thomas Bishop and speaking of-- the ending totally blew me away. I read the same page of the ending three times all the while saying to myself ""OH MY GOD"". After getting so caught up in the cat and mouse chase and into the personality of each of the characters, if the ending doesn't shock you to pieces--nothing will. I am most deffinately looking for more Shane Stevens books. To all the people who reviewed this book and gave it such a high rating - THANK YOU. You are the ones who made me decide to read it and I hope many more Murder Mystery readers will pick it up, also. You will not regret it at all!!"
3,solid research but too long and not interesting,"There's no doubt Stevens did his homework. He got all of the facts straight and came up with a solid plot but he mistook quantity of words for quality.The 1st chapter for example lays the foundation for much of the book but it's written so dryly. I hoped it'd pick up after this...Unfortunately the following chapters weremuch like the 1st, lots of information but boring writing..Sure the crimes were described in gruesome detail..this was interesting, but other than that, the book seemedlike it was just cranked out in order to meet a deadline..I was sorry I wasted my time on this...Michael"
1,Exactly what you'd expect--Absolutely awful.,"Sub-par, even taking in the fact that it's a fifteen-dollar VGA camera. The only feature that worked with any regularity was the webcam, as the custom (and difficult to install) software for the camera installs it as a regular Windows capture device, and uses a proprietary program to extract pictures taken. The modes were confusing, the pictures were always dark, and you never truly know if you've taken a picture (it beeps either way). I thought I'd use it to take pictures for Craigslist listings (and for those you don't need high quality), but the pictures weren't good enough for even that. As for the fact that it's a semi-useful webcam--well, better webcams can be had for the same price. Not recommended for anyone. Note: Very difficult to find the driver for Windows Vista, and camera software mostly does NOT work, even with the driver."
5,Rosemary Edmonds Translation of Tolstoy Credible and Musical,"This translation (forget any attempt at adding to the praise of my favorite novel, as the closest I can say is one must read the book in the way they should attend Handel's ""Messiah"" atleast once in their life), Rosemary Edmond's masterful and careful version as from its 1963 appearance, may still be the most accessible and, dare one say it, compact. While many from the previous generation become familiarized with the Garnett and still others the later of 1970s, this one offers some clarity while never editing the text down to an ad reducto abridgement. Some day some one will offer a nice compendium to the original manuscripts from their entirety, providing a score which when played whill be something like hearing a newly-discovered Bach concerto. Strongly recommend"
5,A perfectly isosceles novel,"Through Tolstoy's mastery of device, confutation, and liminality, we are graced in this age with easily available wisdom from a great sage of the ""Pleh"" era. By weaving alternate strands of recontextualized violence and thoroughgoing renascence, the author has brought before us in a new, brilliant manner the age-old conflict between X and Y, or, as Turgenev once put it, between cat, dog, and lamppost."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The flap on this pet door lasted exactly one week before it tore off. The plastic flap has small holes across its top, through which metal screws secure it to the metal frame. They do not put grommets around the small holes, so the plastic ripped off within one week. We have two dogs, so we bought the ""heavy duty"" model for multiple dogs (it has a metal frame, rather than a plastic frame). Both of our dogs are older, so it's not as though they're particularly hard on the flap. Conveniently, the manufacturer embeds the replacement part number in the plastic flap, so you can easily order another. If you choose to buy this door, you might as well get 51 extra flaps, one for each week of the year."
4,Good product,Just finished installing this doggie door. Easy install. Would have given this 5 stars but the hardware was plastic. I broke 3of the four nut& bolt installing. Luckily I had some misc. Hardware in my garage. So I highly recommend getting metal harware before you start the install.
2,door,THE FRAME IS MADE OF PLASTIC NOT ALUMINUM I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED IT BUT ALREADY RETURNED ONE THAT IMAGE AND MEASURMENTS WERE DIFFERENT FLAP WAS NOT VERY AIR TIGHT DIDNT THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE REALLY AIR TIGHT BUT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER I MADE ONE ON MY OWN THAT WAS THIS GOOD ALSO COVER FOR NIGHT OR WHEN YOUR AWAY IS NOT SECURE COVER BARELY STAYS ON WIND WILL BLOW IT OFF ALTOGETHER NOT PLEASED
4,Rubbermaid Turntable,"Moving into a new, and smaller kitchen poses frustrating problems for an avid spice user. The only cabinet logically available for my herb & spice collection is a wedge shaped corner unit. The opening , being smaller than the rest of the cabinet, does not allow for lining up the jars in plain sight. But 3 Rubbermaid Turntables solved the problem, and holds all my blends, mixes and singles!"
2,"Cheap, flimsy, but does turn NOW","Wanted to use this for my old, classic scrabble board, to make it rotatable. I wanted one big enough to cover the 14 inch board, to minimize tipping and maximize stability. I had memories of Rubbermaid products as being decent quality, albeit a bit overpriced.This turntable turned out to be close to a piece of junk. Cheaply made, flimsy, and not very smooth with rotation. I didn't need super quality for this application, but the rotation would constantly hang up. A turntable that doesn't turn well !!! Then it fell apart on me. During reassembly attempts, I inadvertently reversed the rotating part, and VOILA, it works better and smoother: ""Accident - Mother - Invention"".Rubbermaid: shame, shame."
3,A little flimsy,"I had one of these that I bought several years ago from Bed, Bath & Beyond that I had under my bathroom sink. I piled my lotions and hair products on it. It beats digging around for them when all I have to do is turn the lazy susan. I thought I would get another for the other bathroom. Although both are Rubbermaid this one is more filmsy and not as sturdy as my first one but it will still work. It did come with a huge black mark on it that was hard to get off. I had to use one of those magic erasers on it to get it off."
3,could've been better,"There are some good fight scenes and a good story in this one along with widescreen and 5.1,but it shoots itself in the foot with that way over the top asian film humor,dont get me wrong I like alot of the comedy/Kung Fu films just not this one becouse they go to far not taking the film itself serious.If you want some funny Fu get ""drunken master""the new or old one there both great or Snake in the eagles shadow.I cannot recommend Shaolin Drunkard."
3,not as tough as I thought,"first time I used it the strainer bag ripped in the corner. after I figured out the tincle strength I haven't ripped another, however I will probably double bag next time."
3,Box isn't large enough for device,"While the clip-on light seems to be adequate, the box in which it is supposed to be stored is too small to hold it."
4,Present for Hubby!,"I purchased this for my husband, and he thought it was great. The only draw back are alot of the games are not the normal type you would play so they just go to waste. But other than that it was worth it for the price."
3,FE Review Manual,"There is nothing rapid about this review manual.It is more than 1000 pages and as large as a city phone book! However, it IS comprehensive."
2,FE Review Manual,"The book does not explain concepts too well. It is good for review only, but if you have to learn something its pretty worthless. Also, its big claim is that it follows the order of the FE provided equation book, but I found this claim to simply be false. It seems to go in a random order and decide arbitrarily how many questions to ask for each section."
4,FE Manual Review,I have gone through about half the book so far in my attemp to study for the FE exam. The book is very good in its layout. It follows the FE guide book pretty well also. The information in most of the chapters is adequate to answer the sample problems. Although there are areas that assume that you know some basic formulas. It is suggested that you get out your college books for reference. Manipulating and transposing of formulas is used on a regular basis also. You will scratch your head wandering where they got the formulas! All in all it is a very good book and should give you the knowledge to pass the exam. Good luck.
5,Fast delivery - a real lifesaver,"My son had only 3 weeks to study for his FE exam. I ordered this book and he received it within 3 days. He won't know for a few weeks if he passed the exam, but I know having this book helped him to feel much more confident about it."
5,Good review manual,This review manual was shipped in a timely manner and is exactly what I need for exam preparation. It is a good general reference too.
1,Not the best...,"I purchased this book along with the Mechanical specialty study guide. I've only been out of college for 6 months, but I still found this book to be confusing and unhelpful. Its basically only good for practice problems because the review sections are WORTHLESS. Even in the practice problems throughout the book I found numerous typo's and mistakes in both the problems and the solutions. I haven't tried any other book to compare it to, but there has got to be something better..."
2,DC meets D&D,"I don't know, maybe Ed Hannigan played a lot of Dungeons & Dragons in his childhood. But League of Justice, one of the Elseworlds line of DC stories, definitely has its root in a host D&D; and early 1980s pulp fantasy novels.Four normal kids -- three upstanding young camp counselors and a ne'er-do-well thief and junkie -- are inexplicably summoned to another world where knights and sorcerers and monsters fight for supremacy. After being rescued in the forest by a Jack o' the Green variation on Green Arrow and his mystical Bird Lady, the four are forced to set out and seek various heroes -- the Batmancer, the Amazon Princess, the Hawk Lord and others -- to fight the evil Sovereign (Superman) in a bid to save the kingdom.Hannigan, working with Dick Giordano, supplies the art, which is good, solid stuff. But the story is hokey. By the end, I had to wonder how many plot points were resolved by the roll of a 20-sided die.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor"
1,Incomprehensibly Worthless,"OK, for all you young whippersnappers interested in checking out some old geezer 60's rock in the form of Vanilla Fudge, here is the beginner's guide: ""Vanilla Fudge"" and ""Near the Beginning"" are both pretty swell and well worth a few listens. ""Renaissance"" is middling OK but not essential. ""Rock and Roll"" is pretty awful. And ""The Beat Goes On"" is downright unlistenable tripe. If you are a Fudge completist (are there any such people?) buy this if you must but do not under any circumstance expect to hear anything remotely good or interesting. This was an insult to the intelligence when it was released and today is downright laughable. Just read the track listing!By all means check out some of Vanilla Fudge's good stuff (real cheezy but still in a good kind of way). But this one is a mess. Be forewarned."
2,"Nice idea, bad story","Although the idea of a sentient virus trying to take over the hegemony in the universe is a nice idea, the people remain flat and the surroundings rather vaque. The story is more the story of the idea than an elaboration put in a believable world. I would not recomment this book to readers who like depth in characters and color in surroundings."
2,Action but no thrill,"A fill in the blanks thriller. Good guys? with lots of money seek revenge and then try to avoid retribution. An obvious first of more to come, but it hasn't hooked me."
5,AWESOME!,"I can't think of any other word to describe the dvd. Meatloaf is such a great performer and those in his band compliment him so well, especially his back up singer Patti."
2,oh stinky,"Don't waste your time with this dreck. go get Dan Zevin's ""The Day I Turned Uncool: Confessions of a Reluctant Grown-up."""
2,It was okay,"The essays were decent, closely observed, but all in all, a waste of time, both mine and Ms. Daum's."
1,A disappointment,The promotional statement about this book makes big promises about how it will make a difference in your career that it doesn't keep. I used it and found its advice was relatively worthless. I don't think the authors must be operating in the same environment that I am. I got much better advice from one of my teachers and some more experienced therapists I met at a chapter (AMTA) meeting.
4,The saviors of rock have arrived. It's about time.,"I caught this band live (accident, went to see another band) in LA. Wow. Most bands, in a small space, with a small crowd, stand around and suck. These guys tore the roof off the Troubador. On a Tuesday. The live show is about 50X better than the cd, but the disk is still totally worth it. They didn't play my favorite song from the disk - Sunk - too low enery for their kicking live show."
4,Works fine,"Seems to work great as long as you scrub twice across your grill, and don't keep scrubbing for over a minute over a hot grill until the plastic base melts."
1,Totally Dissatisfied,"The first try was with brown rice, so I expected the time to be longer. The ricecooker totally overcooked the rice, with scorching at the bottom. The second tryI used white rice and monitored the cooking and time closely just to see when the switch would would go off. At one hour and fifteen minutes I manually moved theswitch up to turn it off knowing that the rice was already way overcooked. Same as the first time, overcooked and slightly scorched at the bottom.Total waste of money, and good rice. Retailed for $20, I purchased it on sale for$10. (I guess they were getting rid of it - for good reason.)"
3,Sounds familiar...,"This book was pretty good, with an ok plot and characters...for someone that didn't read the ""Mates, Dates, and..."" series. The books are practically the same. Cat sounds alot like Lucy, who also lives in a house with a big family, has a crush on her friends older brother, and meets a new friend who is gorgeous, just like when Lucy meets Nesta, in ""Mates, Dates.."". The books are so simular that it's easy to mix the two books' characters up. If you don't mind a little confusion, then read both series, because if you like one, you will like the other."
2,they dont relate,I have to say this series is horrible. there so stupid and they dont relate to real life. They bore me. i would rather read something more intersting like the gossip girl series or the hard cash triloigy.
5,Great read,Loved this book it was extremely interesting and only wish there was a sequel. I'm a reader not a writer so have no more to say only that it's a clean book with no trash and I loved that too.
2,Does not fit the albums it is advertised with,"I ordered 3-ring photo albums, which I love. This item pops up as recommended. It does not fit the albums I ordered. Why would you advertise these items together? Makes no sense. Of course I returned them."
4,Pages for memories...,"Here is the only realiable Refill for a PMV-206, and it is as the original that came with the album, so it a winner! Suggest you pick this item up if you want to add photos to your 206 album.."
1,extension post not threaded,"The additional sheets seemed to be what was expected, but one of the extension posts was un-threaded and therefore unusable and as a result the sheets could not be added to my album. This is a don't buy."
3,Not for Stainless Sinks,These may work great on soft metal but they don't last on stainless. We are installing dishwashers in an apartment building and this is not the tool to drill the holes for the air gaps. I t lasted about 10 holes.
4,VMWare + Windows makes my Mac even more productive,"Bought this version of Windows to go on my Mac to run virtual in VMWare Fusion. Its works perfectly, better then on a windows work station!"
5,Fantastic!,"I have the entire Circus Days series (started with volume three) and lemme tell you; this is some GREAT stuff, and this volume is perhaps the best. Don't be turned off by the shoddy packaging (compared with even PEBBLES it falls flat), but dear god...OK...this isn't really like Nuggets. It tends to not be as much ""garage rock"" as it is eclectic and tuneful. That, to me, is a GOOD thing, and you've got some remarkable variety here. ""What May I Not Know"" (or whatever it's called...can't see the tracklisting) is absolutely AMAZING...at parts, it almost sounds like Jethro Tull! You get the feeling here that MANY of these songs could've been hits...they just weren't, perhaps due to underexposure.So there. It's great. About the only song I don't like, in fact, is Ice Cream Man, so feel free to ignore that..;)"
1,not at all helpful,"This book was written to promoter herself and to drive up the cost of vintage clothing. Save your money, do your research online and go buy a dress at a thrift shop!"
3,Calvino does naturalism,"In a lot of ways this seems to borrow heavily from the naturalism of so much of 19th century lit. You've got a character stuck in a dreary urbanized world, but instead of just wallowing in the ash and grime of industrialization, waiting for him to be defeated and destroyed by his urbanized, regimented existence, Calvino waves this cyclical narrative that shows how one person still manages to find these little moments of everyday beauty, tenderness, and humor in what is otherwise a grinding, monotonous existence."
5,"Put some spice into your life, buy this book!","I wish that ""Herbs & Spices: The Cook's Reference"" by Jill Norman had been the first book (on this subject) that I had purchased. I have several other books on herbs and spices which are now gathering dust on my bookshelf. I am going to donate them to my local library as I find Ms. Norman's book is the one that I turn to whenever I want to know more about a specific herb or spice. The book is well organized and beautifully illustrated."
4,Very Cool Reference Book,"This is a great reference book. I like how it gives just the facts about the herbs and spices and not just a bunch of complicated recipes like other cooking/food books. (It does have a few recipes towards the end.) Also, it is in a very conversational writing style and can be read like a regular book. The only down side is it is a huge book so it can be overwhelming. I didn't know there were so many herbs and spice and so many variations."
4,Great reference on herbs and spices!,"I am thrilled with the photos and details that this book contains. Each herb and spice covered also covers the variants available, such as Basil, Lemon Basil, etc.A wonderful reference for any cook wishing to be more creative in their use of spices and herbs."
5,Perfect Combination,"I ordered this book after much consideration. I have recently been struck with an intense love of mixing herbs and spices in with my cooking. I live in rural Nebraska so the spice variety is a little less varied but wanted to learn all that I could about cooking with herbs and spices and how to grow them if I wanted to. This book is laid out beautifully and has great information. I love the ""Culinary uses"" section for each herb or spice and the information on how to select items from the store, how the taste rates, and the pictures are just fabulous. As a new person to the realm of spices and herbs I am delighted to see that this book meets my needs. I only wish that the book would tell of the medical uses of certain herbs and spices are. Guess we can't have it all however."
5,great!,"This ring is great! i Have had it since last April, and no problems so far. Its cute, and light weight so i can barely feel it, for those of us who are bothered by rings. SO far no warping and still looks new even being worn every day."
5,Perfect for Me!,"I have fairly big/wide fingers, and everyone noticed this immediately the next day. I have other rings and they hardly ever notice them. But they sure marveled at this one! I loved how it made my fingers look slimmer, and longer too. The shipping was fast and quick, so don't expect to wait long to have your friends and neighbors marvel over you and your new ring."
1,Finger Turned Green with in 24 hours!,Not happy! The reason is becuase my finger turned green in less than 24 hrs after having it on my finger.
5,Stepping Back in Time,"If you want a picture of what life was like at the turn of the 20th century, the games that were played, the values that were held, the topics that were important or relevant, and the simple activities that friends and family created together - then you'll appreciate this book. A friend loaned me her copy and now I'm buying my own to add to my historical resources collection. I know I'll refer back to it when I'm looking for ""old time games"" to play with my grandchildren or to draw from for a historical presentation. ( The publication date is 1909, so the games and activities in it were played over 100 years ago.) It was great fun to read and very interesting. It was like stepping back in time. 5 stars!"
5,nice read,"a nice love story, not as ""action-like"" as some of radclyffe's books. but it's awesome in its own way. (i don't know what i'm saying.)anyway, totally recommended for slow, enjoying-time kind of read. just great!"
4,Contains rare Christmas tracks!,"Certainly, it's nice to have this on CD - all the tracks are extremely rare. But, it's all mastered from VINYL - even the 1974 comedy tracks. Just thought you should know....Track listing (1974 comedy LP):1. That's Rich2. The Dirty Old Man3. The TV Man4. Frigid5. Kelsey's Nuts And Bolts6. Agony and Pain7. Me and My Shadow8. The Happy CookerBonus Tracks:9. I Was A Teen Age Reindeer (with Daws Butler) (1959)10. Why Don't You Go Home For Christmas (1958)11. The Office Party (1959)12. Delicious (The Laughing Song) (1958)"
3,One big laugh on this album,"I bought this CD mainly for the last cut on it, titled Delicious. A local radio station played it and I almost drove off the road laughing so hard. The rest of the album is humorous and is very reminiscent of the way comedy was done way back when I was a kid. It might bring a smile or a chuckle if you're in a good mood. On the other hand, Delicious was different. After I heard it, I searched the Internet for anything like it and found nothing available. Laughter can be so infectious and that's what this is. It was worth the price of the album just for this one track."
5,Saying goodbye to old friends,"The King of Queens is the most underrated show of the last decade. Everybody Loves Raymond was great, but K of Q was a much funnier show. The chemistry between the three main characters--Doug, Carrie and Arthur--makes for countless laughs, even when no dialog is spoken. The show strikes a special chord if you grew up middle class in the New York area. I have been an avid fan for from the beginning and am so happy that we don't have to wait too long for the final season to be released. Buy all nine seasons and you will always be among friends."
3,Disappointing.,"The delivery of this item was impressive. Although, the statistics are not as good. It says it is .38x. Basically the lower [.#x], the better. I wanted an upgrade from the fisheye lens that I had bought a while ago from a different company, which was .42x. Of course, I was expecting a greater angle bend with more wide conversion, however, I was disappointed. It did not perform like my previous fisheye did. I took off the Macro lens to see if that made a difference, and it made a huge difference. There was mkore conversion. But without the Macro, the threads of the fisheye is maybe 1mm less than my camera's, and did not catch threads, so I can't just use it alone, even so, if I use it alone, I would have to zoom in a little to get the sides of the fisheye out of view. I am forced to buy an adapter. Either that, or use this fisheye which isn't as good as my old one, which, to me, is not logical at all."
5,Valentine light strand,"I wanted to create a ""valence"" of lights over my living room drapes for February. Rather than just red lights, I wanted to use hearts. I found this strand. I needed to use two strands connected to give a nice scalloped, valence look above my sheer curtains. I left them on for ambiance all of February and enjoyed. 'The red glow was warm along with some warm white lights I had against another wall. (this review is asking me to review the product as a toy -- it is not -- it is a light fanciful light strand -- There is no particular educational value; ""durable"" is relative obviously, as a light decorative light strand on the wall, it is fine -- somehow the category is off ! But I enjoyed the lights for the purpose I bought them for, so hence 5 stars -- lol )"
4,THEY DO CARRY ON,"Carry On Cleo is perhaps one of the funniest and best of the Carry On Collection. This technicolor film has all of the ""Carry On"" cast including guest appearances by Jim Dale and Francis DeWolf. Cleopatra never had it so good. If she did, she would have died laughing."
4,Works well,Does not leave dust. Solution dries good. Does a fair job for your quick-and-dirty effort to clean your sensor lens.
1,You get what you pay for,"As they say, you get what you pay for. I received the table with one of the edges cracked and a crack in one of the legs. For the price (I bought it on sale) I figured I could live with it but the table has a strong sour smell. Not sure if it will go away with time but all in all a pretty disappointing purchase. If not for the above would have been a nice little table.Update: In fairness to the seller, they did refund my money in a very timely manner. After a few days the table still had a very strong odor and was unusable."
2,Create floating flakes,"This lit reasonably well and burned clean, but when it burned, it discharged burned paper like flakes that floated into the food. I have had more success with the Koko charcoal for my ceramic cooker."
4,Nourish,This DVD is a quick introduction to the world of thoughtful eating. The narration is easy to follow and understand and it touches on many important topics.
3,"Way Demented!! - ""The Warrior's Way""","Looking for a film that's a ""tad"" different? Ha Ha - well, search no more and check out ""The Warrior's Way""!This flick is a crazed blend of ninja marital arts, American western, murder mystery, sick comedy and a Fellini film.I'm not even going to try and describe what it's about - just trust me that it was made in New Zealand and features top-notch production values, state-of-the arts photography and some of the coolest and goofiest EFX ever! It's a daft amalgamation of many films you've seen and like none you ever have. This one will put a smile on your mouth!"
5,What a Samuri Jack Movie would have looked like.,"Very unappreciated movie. We love this movie and have seen already a few times. Don't know why it crashed at the box-office. It is very much a Samurai Jack story in tone, script and visuals. Dong-gun Jang could easily have been Samurai Jack and his master could easily have been Aku. The quirky characters in the run down town of Lode (somewhere on Highway 49 between Nevada City and Stockton though the scenery looks nothing like it) are reminiscent of the harsher town folk that Clint Eastwood would run into with a much lighter touch. The Colonal is almost as scary as the Joker. The soundtrack is beautiful but can't seem to find it to purchase. Watch...movies like this get a second chance at life in the dvd/streaming market...then maybe they'll release the soundtrack to us."
5,a must see,"First, let me say this film is way over the top as many modern martial arts movies are these days. The way Ninjas glide and fly through the air for example. If you can except it for what it is (entertainment) I think you'll enjoy it. The scenery is artsy- the way the sky looks and the setting is in an old dusty traveling carnival type town that is bullied by a bunch of outlaws. I don't know who the main actor is here but he was amazing. It's violent and gory so not for young eyes. 5 Stars.If you haven't already, also check out a movie from 2004 called Kung Fu Hustle, parts are comedic but the martial arts moves and fights are eye candy!"
4,Ospf Anatomy of An Internet Routing Protocol,A clear and concise description of the protocol for the novice and experienced veteran. Good study and reference to keep while implementing the protocol for any developer.
4,A little heavy...,"I bought this so I didn't have to walk downstairs and make a second cup of coffee with a second filter in my melitta cone filter. Well, it's not exactly filled the purpose. It's very heavy, even empty, and of course, it takes twice as long to fill as it does a single large mug of coffee. That's not the fault of the carafe, of course. I'm just impatient. But it worked just great when I had a luncheon for a dozen neighbors, although then it was not large enough and I had to refill it three times. You're probably wondering why I didn't just make a pot of coffee in my coffee maker...but I couldn't find that after moving three times."
2,Very disappointing,"I had heard good things about this album from a friend, and I had like earlier Boo Radley's songs I had heard on radio, but this album disappointed me. Perhaps it's just that there's not enough in Martin Carr's voice to sustain interest over the whole album, but the album struck me as a rather bland confection. I've listened to it five times now and it's not getting any better."
2,golf short game by wood,check print date before buying. Tiger changed his swing completely after this book. Still a good value but a little dated.
5,"Far more lighthearted, easy-listening than other albums from Dufay","DuFay Collective are, in a word, brilliant, basically the Pink Martini of the music of the period. Their music never fails to transport you back in time. However, for the most past, medieval music isn't something you plug into the CD player on long drives between cities. This album is an exception. The focus is on medieval dance music of France, England and Italy, and the pieces are light-hearted and ""catchy"" enough to keep me entertained on replay for hours at a time. There are no vocals to speak of in any of these pieces, but the degree of excellence in each performer's command of their instrument is patently obvious. It's a highly recommended compilation that any medieval enthusiast should have in their CD case, as well as something any fan of ""World Music"" would wholeheartedly enjoy."
3,Neocon HEAVEN,"It's a universe where things really ARE black & white, the enemy really IS worthy of no respect or sympathy, all civilians are morons, all progressives are closet traitors, and ""political"" admirals are color-coded to easily distinguish them from REAL military heroes.The irony is that the chief difference between ""us"" and ""them"" (the latter being the Arachnids) is that THEY have no liberals, no progressives, no moral qualms, no sympathy for anyone different from themselves, no ""humanist"" qualities whatsoever.It's unintentional satire, I think. Does someone out there believe the real world resembles the Weber-White universe in any way?Aside from the politics of it, you can start anywhere in the 800-page ""brick"" and be sure that the next 100 pages are JUST like the previous 100 pages."
1,Boring,"Rushed to get the book within a few days of release, however, took 3 months to finally finish the book. the reason= very boring, the only interesting parts were the paragraphs discussing bug tactics. you can read one chapter and guess what will be in the next chapter.the story becomes unilateral with the only tactics employed were the huge numbers of ships, missiles etc.the bugs lacked numerical, technical and tactical advantage. on top of that the ""Shiva option"" really gave the allies an edge that was not needed."
1,Junk,"Installed in my new house Sept 05, died Feb 06 and replaced, died again Oct 06! Try something else!"
3,Not sure about this one,"Ok when I listen to Gary Rossington, I expect to hear bluesy boogie, boogie guitar licks. Now I don't expect it to sound just like Skynyrd, or RCB, but you are what you are. I'm all toward a musician growing and progressing musically, but there is something just not right about this recording. It just sounds a bit too polished, to typically 80's. I love the 70's Skynyrd, and some of the new Skynyrd too. But I just can't get into this. the best song of the cd is the live version of ""Don't Misunderstand me"""
1,Vanilla Sludge,"The joke was already over - and, to be truthful, it wasn't really that funny a joke to begin with. Vanilla Fudge weren't really the worst of their breed, but if you want one good Vanilla Fudge album stick to the most recent best-of disc and take an amazing pass on this one, especially, for any number of reasons - not least of which is, the best track on the album (""Some Velvet Morning"") is included on the newest best-of. Unless, of course, you're masochistic enough to need every last side-long cut of the 1960s (and if ""Break Song"" isn't the most exasperatingly punishing of the lot, I don't know what else to say), or sadistic enough to need evidence that the only thing Vanilla Fudge really had in common with Cream was a name suggesting cool summertime treats. If you're that desperate for the one original Vanilla Fudge album which won't drive you out of your mind, try ""Renaissance""."
5,welding rods,Just as good as the name brands. Probably made by them with a different nameStrikes easy with good fill
4,"Good, left a bit to be desired","I found this book to be very interesting and informative, a good read for both students of the occult or anyone interesting in reading about the darker side of magic.I did find that it left a bit to be desired in the way that there are gaps in some of the text, gaps which would have contained important information. Aside from that a good read, better if one has companion texts that are mentioned in the book."
3,The Book of Black Magic,"Provided you can sift through the large amount of text this can prove a useful reference tool for most occult studies. The section regarding the art of necromancy leaves a lot to be desired. As to the '72 Spirits of the brazen Vessel', how much can you trust the opinion of a 'Christian Demonologist'?"
1,Mossy Oak Steering Wheel Cover,Mossy Oak Steering Wheel Cover. Bought it for a F 150 and it was too small
5,Were has this Book been My whole sales Life,"This Book is a must Read if you ever want to be successful in any kind of sales. I have been doing mortgages for as longs as I can remember. And I can honestly say that what I've learned and the first couple of chapters I have not learned in six years of getting knock on my butt thru trial and error. I have made very good money in this industry but it has cost me a lot of time and money. I would be retired by now if I would have read this book years ago. This book makes so much sense it's scary. (Why couldn't I put these ideas together??).If you don't make or stick to any New Year Resolutions, Please do yourself a favor make it your Business to read and understand this book. Because if you are in Sales it is your Business. To the Author: You have saved me from the horrible world of ""Loan Officer Burn Out"". With your teachings I have found a new Love For my Profession. Thanks Dave the Marketing Master."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I found Peter Sam's book to be a tremendous disappointment. The book itself is 300 pages long with a nice glossy cover and a table of contents that promises to get into all sorts of interesting things. The book did not measure up, however, to my expectations.Well over half of the book is devoted to a series of appendices with outdated information that appears to be taken out of old directories or websites. And the insights contained in the body of the book are few and far between. Most of the suggestions are fairly superficial and obvious (e.g., establish networks).I won't buy this book again, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought the book thinking that it would provide useful guides in international environmental consultancy. But the book contained very little useful information, plenty of outdated information, and large chunks of the text are superficial that anyone already in the consulting business would already know. There are some factual erros in the text and some stereotyped description of people and business in developing countries. The book is a waste of my money."
1,very poor,"Sterling Silver 9mm Wide Celtic Knot Cross Spinning Spin Ring (Size 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)this ring WAS a spinner ring. the darkened part was gone within days and the ""spinner"" inside section broke and fell out in 10 days. there has been no response from e-mails to the company yet."
5,FANTASTIC,"This book is outstanding. My fiancee picked it up and my first thought was ""great a book that is going to say I do everything wrong and she's always right"". How wrong I was. Eric and Leslie start out with a bold assumption-- that marriage can be great and that people need to strive for a fairy tale marriage instead of hoping to get by. They take the reader through all the important ideas and give practicle, real world tips to put it all into action. I'd give this book to any couple you know who are going to be getting married soon, it could be the most important book they read on marriage."
4,Simplicity is best,"I replaced my mobo chipset fan with this and have to say that i'm pretty happy with both the noise reduction and its ability to cool. I just installed the thing and have had my computer on for a while and the mobo temp is perhaps +1C higher than with the fan (maybe the thermal paste needs time to set?)The settings where a bit hard to get correct, but this certainly wasn't the most difficult replacement I've done. Overall, the worse part of the process was removing the motherboard - but once you have this baby on there, you'll reduce the chance to need to remove it again."
4,Quality product but monitor motherboard temp,"The heatsink installs easily if you have any mechanical aptitude at all. My motherboard temperature runs a little higher than I wanted but the quietness of the system is amazing. I have a quiet cpu cooler and a quiet power supply on my system. Again, all computers should be this quiet. I think this heatsink will benefit from a case design with dual case fans or at least a an blowing across the heatsink."
1,Not UL certified?,"Does not specify whether it is UL certified, as the other similar item here on Amazon does.A very important label, if you want to TRUST the product."
4,so far so good,"I'm not all the way through the book but so far it's a good one. It explains the rules of grammer and is easy to understand, a great second level book."
3,A collection of conspectuses.,"This book is, above all, a collection of conspectuses about various classical authors' views on the factors(most related to the development of a distinctly Western mindframe) that triggered the commercial and technological dominance of the West from the XVIIIth Century on. By doing so, the author misses the opportunity to investigate more closely the actual political and economic factors at work (""Imperialism"", for instance, and not only in the Leninist sense). Also, his remarks on the authrors selected are sadly banal and add nothing new. To be used at most as an undergraduate textbook. Too bad that Macfarlane didn't write nothing that could compare to his works on English individualism and and the role of marriage in pre-modern England."
4,Dora dora,"The girls just love Dora, I could care less.. Daughters love this disc and chose to watch it pretty regularly."
4,Work fine.,Work well. Fairly easy to install. I put them on my van. One caveat is a right angle drill is helpful as the tires get in the way of wheelwell screws and the frame doesn't have a whole lot of room either. One tip is to buy extra 1/4 x 20 bolts and bolt the braces to the frame through preexisting holes. It's a lot easier than drilling the frame and you're less likely to hit one of the lines routed through there. I suspect that my Ford van was predrilled as there were hole in the prescribed spots.
3,"A bare bones guide, pricey for what you get","Barely 70 pages total, this book consists of a number of not always clear photos, a few diagrams, some history and some info on how to make yourself a suit with a few tips on using it. Paladin Press books are always a little pricey for what you get, at least Amazon gives a good deal.I found that the author seems to favor adapting BDU's (military uniform shirts & pants)and poncho's by sewing a variety of materials onto them. He gives some instruction and tips on that as well as suggested lists of materials. I guess this little book is all right but I'd like it to have been about twice as long with more information on making suits and a LOT more on using them."
2,No mid-foot flexibility,There's a tiny elastic gusset on the inner edge of shoe which does not allow for enough flexion when walking. I found wearing these shoes to be painful.
3,Intermittently effective,"We got this lock to keep our toddler in our high-rise apartment (front door automatically unlocks when opened from the inside). It works about 65% of the time, but quite often, it seems to not fall into place like it should when I lock it. So, voila! The door opens without much resistance. Also, sometimes it is quite difficult to unlock. This could perhaps be because of the white paint coating? If I were going to buy a lock again, I would try one without the white coating -- not as nice looking, but perhaps more effective? Either that, or I would just try a different product altogether."
5,Songs...,"both march of the pigs, both closer to god's, fixed, x-rated t-shirt and badge setwhat more could you ask."
5,Love this Sangria set,I was originally looking for a large glass pitcher to serve lemonade when guests come over. This is such a good find at Amazon and now I used it for every drink that I can serve cold. This set looks great at any party or table setting. The glasswares are not thin like others and sturdy. It is classy and looks a lot better than the plastic containers. It also comes with 6 nicely shaped glasses and sometimes I use them to serve desserts and icecream soda. This is a very versatile glass set and the price is right. I am happy with this purchase and would recommend this product.
1,Look for better item,"After about 2 years I had to update to better one.The pages just kept falling apart and I am very careful about my books and albums.I prefer pioneer screw album, refillable."
2,Not my favorite,"I got this dishsoap because it was the best deal on Amazon. Now I know why. The soap is pretty weak and takes more than other brands to get the dishes clean. It IS all natural, so if that is important to you that would be a positive. To me, a better deal would be a stronger soap.The packaging was also very poor and beat up. Every bottle was dented when it arrived (though thankfully none were leaking).Back to Dawn for me."
1,KEEP JURY IN ENGLAND,"I COULD NOT FINISH THIS BOOK. I HAVE GREATLY ENJOYED THE OTHER INSPECTOR JURY MYSTERIES AND WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED.. MY THEORY IS THAT THE FAULT LAY IN TRYING TO SET AN ENGLISH MYSTERY IN THE US. THE INTERIORITY AND SENSE OF PLACE THAT SO CHARACTERIZES ENGLISH MYSTERY DOES NOT WORK IN A SETTING LIKE THE US. FROM THATSTEM ALL THE OTHER DIFFICULTIES WITH THIS BOOK-- FLOUNDERING AND LOST - BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS ARE NOT AT ""HOME"". AGATHA CHRISTIE COULD PULL IT OFF BUT WHEN POIROT WAS IN EGYPT, FOR INSTANCE, HE WAS SURROUNDED BY ENGLISHMEN WHO HAD IN EFFECT ""BROUGHT' THEIR PORTABLE WC'S ( LIKE THE ENGLISH DID IN AFRICA) ON THEIR ""SAFARIS"". (sorry about the capitals - just noticed it)"
2,Disappointing....,"I've been a fan of Martha Grimes a long time and have read all of the Richard Jury series in order. I've loved every one that I've read until this one. It's very confusing (and also uninteresting)to me and I know the history of all the main charactors...anyone who reads this as their first time Grimes mystery will be very disappointed.... Start at the beginning of the series with ""A Man With a Load of Mischief"". This will catch your interest right away and get you hooked on the Richard Jury/Melrose Plant saga. Make sure to read all the Jury mysteries in order..the others are MUCH better than this one !"
1,Confusion rules,"As others, I have read several other novels by Ms. Grimes and have enjoyed them very much. However, this one had me confused from the beginning. The plot made no sense even when the events were solved. In addition it continued to be confusing that the story kept going back to England for no apparent reason. Everyone is entitled to swing and miss now and then, hopefully this is an isolated case. In any event if this is the first Richard Jury mystery you have read and were disappointed, take another shot, I'm sure you will be happier with the result."
1,not durable,Seams ripped out on first or second use on black version. Had 3 sets over couple years. blue lasted a couple weeks.
3,Much Smaller than Sized,"Suit is supposedly XL/XXL. Not even close compared with other things sized the same. Could barely get it on and off. Construction / quality lookd good though. Unfortunatley, because of size, Ihad to return. So, if you really do wear an XL or XXL, don't bother with this. If you are a Small or Med - buy up in size and you should be happy."
3,Better then Nylon,"I owned two other sauna suits and this one held up the best for the price. The nylon ripped with 30 minutes of my first workout, lunging. The material it just a ""light"" and ""movable"" as the nylon ones but last longer with out ripping. Unless your gonna spend over $100 for a profession boxer sweat suit this one is the best you'll find for value.You will retain heat, and sweat (alot)"
1,Rehash of the OJ simpson Trial,"I have hundreds of books in my private Library. This is one of the very few books that I threw in the trashcan. The book started off okay, but when it got to the trial it got very bad. I didn't watch the media circus of the simpson trial and I'm sure not going to read about it. I have tolerated an author's personal crusades slipped in to a story for a page or two. However this author's crusades fills several chapters and probably covers several more. I don't know because I got feed up at chapter 18 and threw the book out. I feel that I should sue the author for defrauding me by claming that the book is science fiction."
2,Mediocre at best,"This book is social commentary thinly disguised as science-fiction/mystery. There's nothing wrong with that per se; combining sci-fi with social-political views goes back at least to H.G. Wells, to a lesser extent to Jules Verne, and for all I know even before that. There's a catch, though: the sci-fi story must be good enough to stand on its own, without the political trappings. Such was the case with ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Time Machine"", etc. Such is not the case with ""Illegal Alien"". The reader is subjected to a steady stream of the author's liberal political and social views, along with a wearying succession of pop culture references. In short, if you're a left-wing kind of person -- to the extent that you'll put up with a mediocre sci-fi yarn just to get your dose of liberal politics -- then this may be the book for you. All others, steer clear. And maybe re-acquaint yourself with a real writer like Wells."
4,Alien OJ trial shows us human society's best and worst,"Robert J. Sawyer has created some fascinating science fiction over the years and ILLEGAL ALIEN is some of his best writing to date. The science fiction aspects are overshadowed by courtroom procedures and random (but fun) pokes at the US judicial system -- and yet they are at the very core of the mystery being played out. One of the best aspects of Sawyer's books to date is using the ""alien"" to expose the human condition -- and show us how our society is as bizarre as any alien society could be. That is shown here in profound and sometimes humorous ways that can be read between the lines of the story. An enjoyable read, sometimes contradictory, yet still worthy of note. Recommended."
3,Pretty good read,"I tend to be a ""big picture"" reader, meaning that I do not pay significant attention to details... a story, for me, either flows or it doesn't.In that context, this book is quite wonderful... as it is a great page turner. I read it in one sitting. However, when compared with numerous readings over the years, Illegal Alien has not struck me as one of the more memorable stories, nor particularly well written. The book is a great blend of mystery, court drama, and sc-fi... would make a fantastic movie with the right screen writer.Worth a read if you are looking for interesting blend of genera, or if you are stuck at an airport."
1,May no longer be active,"On the first day of the trial I got 10 articles, the most recent of which was dated 2 weeks before. During the rest of the trial I got nothing. Maybe the blogger's on vacation, or maybe he stopped doing the blog. The articles I got on that first day were all informative, so the blog will be worth subscribing to if it goes active again."
2,Only Nile Spice soup I hate,"They are all good, except this one: It isn't a real 'cream of potato' style soup, but an ultimately failed attempt to make it taste that way. This is the only type I wouldn't buy again."
3,A Nice Starting Text Book For Fiber Communication Engineers,"The book starting from the evolution of optical communication system, the basic theory of the wave guides including the optical fibers, introduces us the whole image of the fiber communication systems, which includs the light generation, propagation, revceiving, manipulation.... The optical links and networks become the high level topics of the book. It is really a good starting book for fiber communication engineers because of its systematic organization, explicitive language."
3,"A ""list"" of improvements","If you're looking for a techie's ""how to"" book, keep searching. This book provides a very fundamental ""list"" of new enhancements and features to Windows Server 2003. Hence the title, ""Introduction"" to Windows Server 2003. It is very basic and I found myself lulled to sleep. I give this book 3 stars because I blame myself for not awaiting a more hands-on book that can take you thru the installation steps, configuration of different services, etc. If you're a total newbie and want to read up on what this product can do, this is the book for you. However, you can most likely read about these things in a much annotated version in any tech magazine that'll soon be reporting on Server 2003. However, you do get a 360 day evaluation copy of the product. So its not ALL bad."
1,NOT SUPPORTED BY MICROSOFT,"I bought this book thinking that I could get a 360 day free trial as is advertised on the cd that comes with the book... Suprise.. Microsoft will not give you a valid activation key.. The only thing you will get is 1-2 hours of being transferred all over microsoft support groups.The book itself is fairly good if you are not fimilar with their product, but Do Not purchase this book for the ""Free trial"" software."
3,adult coloring book,Bought this for an adult friend of mine who enjoys coloring. She liked it very much!
5,It doesn't matter who you are,"What I'm trying to say is that if you care at all for yourself, you will read this book now.You're not obligated to believe in anything it says, although the footnotes on p.388-423 might convince you otherwise.You're not required to believe anything the author says, unless you care about your health.If you don't want to die of heart attack, stroke, get cancer, or any other disease I suggest you read this book. The whole world suggests you read this book.Even if you read only 10% of the pages in this book, you will be affected.If you care about truth in any way, shape, or form, then you should read this book.If you care about your life and the lives of those around you, and don't want your loved ones to die of heart attacks or strokes, then I suggest you read this book.If you are interested in learning more about why birth defects occur, then maybe you should read this book. Then again, you might not care. (But still, some people do.)"
1,Questions on the whole subject,"Why is it ....................when the third world countries, who are basically vegans, when they can afford it, they desire meat ? Why is it............the affluent people in the world, they can afford choice, try to make the rest succomb to their ways of thinking ? I see all this noise in diets happen in last 10 - 15 years, how did we baby boomers get this far by eating so wrong ? What is the boomers goal....be the healthiest person in your Alzheimer's unit ?"
2,For a limited audience,"As someone who was very excited to understand the background to the Nag Hammadi find, I was disappointed that this account was fairly limited. It glosses over the period of translation and presents a dated view of the contents of the codices themselves. This perhaps was the greatest letdown of all - this is a reprint of a 1958 publication. If you are seeking new information and analysis on this topic then I would consider Elaine Pagel to be my reference of choice."
2,Damaged Goods,"I was a bit nervous ordering a ""factory reconditioned"" model, but was reassured by Amazon's liberal return policy that I had nothing to lose for trying. I ordered the item and it arrived 2 days later. Upon opening the box I noticed that the little protective plastic cover that fits over the thermostatic display was detached and broken. I thought that I could ""live"" with this, but upon further examination I discovered that the bottom of the unit was bent so much that the paint was coming off and that it would be impossible to attach the wheels. This damage DID NOT occur at the hands of UPS (The styrofoam protecting the unit was intact). Delonghi has a very dissapointing quality control over the outbound ""Factory Serviced"" units. Not recommended. Just buy the cheaper model and figure out what dial setting works for you. They all work the same way."
4,Come on everyone!,"I've received this unit in a pretty good condition. There were some small scratches, but other than that, it's in a perfectly usable state. Perhaps maybe just my luck. Thermostat works well, time doesn't change as other reviewer experienced. Overall, a keeper. I am sure Amazon would take it back if i would call them."
2,"Good product, bad packaging","I ordered 2 of these heaters and arrived today in the most beat up boxes I've ever seen. I was skeptical of ordering after reading the many bad reviews here, but I did anyways. I fault Amazon and the way they packaged the product to be shipped. First of all Amazon is shipping these heaters in shipping boxes 3 times larger than the product and amazon added very little packaging material to secure the product from shifting. As a result both boxes arrived smashed to bits, the little air filled packaging material was lost somewhere during shipping, along with my paperwork and while I had one heater survive the trip the other heater looked like it had been in a head on collision and I am in the process of returning this item to amazon. Whoever at Amazon that packaged these heaters up to be shipped surly did not care in what condition they would arrive!"
4,Awesome CD,"I remember working with Lisa back in '98 as she was dedicated to her music. Hearing this CD after all these years brought back good memories. This CD is awesome - especially track 2 "" I would walk through fire "". I wish her the best in all she does."
5,So Sweet,"My mom cried when she got this, normally there is only a mom/daughter break apart, but this charm captured the three of us prefectly!"
3,Interesting but a bit slow...,"I bought this book because I am interested in history and what really happened with the plague. I started reading this book and realized that even though parts of the book were interesting and read like a novel with a story line, there were also very slow parts that I skimmed over. I think it is a good book for history or medical majors, but not great for everyday people looking for an interesting read. A bit slow and plodding for my taste."
4,A painstakingly detailed approach,"The book gives a well documented narrative about landscape lighting design process. One can easily see auther's vast on hand experience in small details. Through case studies one can discover a tried and tested method she has been practicing. It gives really indepth view on not only design and installaiton but also maintenance and common faults. It would have been perfect if there would have been an inclusion of LED technology in lamp, luminaire and practise section. And how she manages lighting power guidelines with conventional technology of halogen. Overall I would say this as an essential reading book for landscape lighting."
5,Another banger from Nile Spice,"Great for lunch, beans and rice pretty much says it all. Spicy and delicious."
3,Very sweet and tender love story.,"This was a really sweet read. I loved the dialogue between Lance and Sarah. From the start you can tell they're going to be great together. The behind the scene stalker story was rather lacking, and almost didn't seem necessary to the overall story, as if it were a second thought and then down played. For me this book started out raring to go and then sort of fizzled toward the end. I loved the characters, I just wish the conflict would have been better developed. And I was disappointed that the heat that was in the first book, was kept to luke warm and behind a closed door in this one. It almost seemed as if Ms. Britton did a re-write to remove the sizzle. Perhaps that was a prerequisite for the NASCAR affiliation? All in all, I did enjoy this very sweet and tender love story."
3,Disappointing,"My first Pamela Britton book was DANGEROUS CURVES. I really liked it and looked forward to this book, but this book is not nearly as good. All the reviews here seem to love it due to NASCAR, but I found it to be a let down. There was also editing errors which I found distracting. It did not live up to my expectations at all. I will give Pamela another chance. I hope the next in the series is better!"
