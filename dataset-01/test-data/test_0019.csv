4,Great book for techies,"This is a good book if you are involved in IT security. Although some of the plot is a bit too simplistic, overall it gives a good account of what could happen."
5,All Classics,"I have the Avon paperback first edition from 1971, it's falling apart from re-readings over the years. While not all the styles may be to all tastes, there are no duds in this collection. It's great to see it's available again. Highly recommended. By the way, if you don't mind paying a small fortune, I think this and the two companion volumes (edited by Ben Bova and out of print elsewhere) are available as a leather-bound set from Easton Press."
4,Fun read for sci-fi buffs.,"Galactic spanning civilizations that distribute news on bulky, printed papers! Moral quandaries about inflexible physical rules as they apply somehow differently to Women (capital W!). The 1940's and 1950's were a different time. Unbounded optimism about man's (maybe not Women's) place in the universe coupled with oddly anachronistic views of technology (let's 'go find a phone' in this space station!) is just plain fun. Time to grab my fedora and fly to Mars!"
2,"Strange, but not entertaining","Babel-17 won the Nebula award for best SF novel in 1966, so I read it eagerly. It was a strange story, but not satisfying. There was much emphasis on language by the main character, a poetess. If you want to read a strange story, there are others I would recommend over this book: Blood Music by Greg Bear, Songs of Earth and Power by Greg Bear, Manifold Space by Stephen Baxter, and Manifold Time by Stephen Baxter are all off-beat, but very good. Sheena 5 is an intelligent squid in Manifold Time. Hearing the thoughts of cognizant squid, seeing the character development of a squid, is a real treat. Babel-17 was not a treat."
3,2 much in 2 small a space,"1 great segment -- the heroine, poet & linguist Rydra Wong, watches a space battle on a giant screen -- very vivid, very flashy. But the rest is just 2 much detail, 2 much happens, 2 much is crammed in2 200 pages. I've read it 2wice, & still think Delany needed more room -- which he wasn't gonna get from the original publishers back in '66. EMPIRE STAR and EINSTEIN INTERSECTION R better, tho this won Delany his 1st Nebula Award...."
1,Gutted after 3 bites,"My dog went straight for the squeaker but in the process tore the stuffing out of the goose's belly. It was over in a couple of minutes. And my dog isn't terribly ferocious (he's a 50-lb dalmatian/terrier mix). We've had much better luck withDoggy Hoots Crackler Woodland Raccoon, a stuffed toy that he loves and that has survived 5 years even with tug-of-warring."
2,"Sadly, my dog is too powerful for this toy","My dog is in love with this toy, so much so I have bought three. Unfortunately, she can't have them any more, she can destroy it in a matter of minutes now. All she has to do is see it and she goes nuts, but she rips the little feet off and then guts it. Great toy for a dog that isn't determined on making the kill :("
5,A Fun Toy,"We have two adult labrador retrievers who absolutely enjoy toys like this one. The feet are generally the first to come off, but that's only because the dogs chew at them. I suppose they are a distraction to the dogs overall pleasure of having this toy. If your dog is a chewer, this may not be the best choice. This toy does have a squeaker in it, so it is important to give it to your dog under supervision. If you leave it with your dog, I can guarantee the dog will work the squeaker out by chewing enough on the toy to rip it open. Nevertheless, a great toy for a dog who simply loves toys like these. Jakks Pacific sells these are rock bottom prices. You can't buy these AKC toys for as low as this seller does."
5,#1 toy,"I got my folks a miniature schnauzer a couple of years ago, and gave her this toy hedgehog (which was then bigger than she was!). It was her very first toy, and she quickly pulled out almost all the fur. After some time, I found another, and she glommed onto that one just as quickly. She's got other toys she loves, but her hedgehogs are are absolute favorite go-to toy. I haven't been able to find one anywhere for a long time, so was thrilled to see one here!"
2,Very small toy -- not recommended for medium or bigger dogs,"I wish the description had specified the size of this toy -- for $7.99, I got a toy that measures approximately 5 inches -- far too small for my 45-pound dog to play with. If you are used to buying the larger, more standard sized AKC Outdoor Series dog toys, please note that this specific item is the small size. I've never returned anything to Amazon before, but I might return this item."
5,Great dog toy,"My little dog loves her squirrel. Plays with it all the time. Chews away to make it squeak. It is her favorite toy.Great buy, good price."
3,cute but only lasted for about 5 minutes,"Dogs will be dogs so you need toys that will stand up to brutal chewing. The Flying squirrel was cute as can be, but our 9 month old had the rope gone in about 5 minutes. Well it was fun to give her and we do still have the squirrel."
3,Appears smaller than its stated dimensions,"Given the rather large size of the small chipmunk, I thought the small fox would be perfect for my 50 lb dogs who sometimes enjoy small furry things. This toy appears so diminuative, though, I was taken aback. The stated dimensions say that it's at least 8 inches! So far, they've shown little interest in it, even though it's a great looking toy--for a Small Dog!"
4,"Dogs Like Them, But a Hairy Situation","My dogs stood up on their feet for 2 minutes straight while I was taking the backing off both the SMALL and LARGE sizes of these squirrels that I got them. They loved them at first sight. They continued to love them. However, there is some of the tail hair coming off and I find wet blobs of tail hair near the dogs and toys. So I am a bit concerned about that and the thought that they could swallow some of that material and it could be bad for the dogs. So I watch them more carefully as they play with the toy. I am considering washing them in the washing machine a few times just to get all the lose hair off and hope for the best that I do not totally ruin it. Very inexpensive online."
1,Not for long,This is one of two animals we bought for our dog. The squeaker broke in just a few hours on this one. Very disappointing.
2,"Cute, Fell Apart Quickly","My hound dog loves to play with stuffed animals. I was hoping for this to be a little bit well made since it is intended for dogs, but he had torn apart the seems with his ginger chewing in a matter of minutes."
5,My dog loves it!,"Skinneeez are my dog's favorite toys. He loves chewing on regular stuffed dog toys until he makes a hole, and then starts pulling out all the stuffing, which we find all over the house. The Skinneeez are not stuffed, so he can't do that, but still loves playing tug with them, and they are really tough."
4,Well-made,"I bought this for my shepherd-rottweiler mix who is driven bonkers by our neighborhood squirrels on a daily basis. i thought it would let her take out some of her rage from the pesky critters. i think it has held up extremely well considering she usually tears apart a toy until the stuffing and squeaker is out. She hasnt even tried to mutilate this one. It still squeaks and hasnt ripped or torn and we've had it since Christmas. Every now and then she carries it around the house and likes you to throw it for her so she can retrieve it. I also boughtKyjen PP01056 Hide-A-Squirrel Pet Toy, Largewhich both of my dogs like."
2,David Talbot's Mr. Right Now,I was disappointed after watching the DVD. I would have liked to have known that it was an on-stage play instead of the movie I thought that it was. This was not made clear or stated.
3,Good info - poor writing,"This book is a classic example of a potentially valuable resource nearly destroyed with poor prose. The well-studied Mr. Storing produced an almost unreadable book through the use of awkward sentence structure and the liberal intermixing of his prose and quotes from founding fathers. He main literary abuse is convoluted sentences, such as ""In reply to all of these objections, the Anti-Federalists complained, they were told, . . . ."". Simple declarative sentences would have made this a wonderful book., and not an exercise in frustration."
4,Intergalactic Dentistry brought right to your bookshelf...,"A simple dentist is just doing his job when he ends up operating on an alien. He impresses the aliens so much that he is kidnapped to train dentists on the aliens' home world. This book is excellent, and indeed an interesting journey for imaginative minds. One of Anthony's best single books in print."
4,Dental,"I thoroughly enjoyed this read. If you are a Piers Anthony fan, a Xanth reader...you will be pleasantly surprised to hear the voices of another type of character. In any case...its hard to imagine that he wrote this so early in his career, but one can certainly see his early promise."
4,An Interesting Flavor of Life in the Middle Ages,"The Gies have made a career out of filling a niche in the medieval history market. Life in a Medieval Village gives a very detailed view of everyday medieval life to the casual reader. As a result, they walk a fine line. Some casual readers may find the text to be dry, and to lend too much detail to seemingly trivial matters, while specialist historians may find the work too general and superficial (not scholarly).I find their work to be engaging, and to provide a fairly good picture of the subject matter. In terms of medieval studies, it's useful to provide a general knowledge base prior to more detailed analysis.I recommend this book as well as their other works."
5,"Excellent moisturizer, fantastic results!!","After having enjoyed the bodylotion of this Lavender line, I decided to try the moisturizer. I did not regret it. At the age of 40 my face became more dry and I started suffering from hyperpigmentation and fine lines.Not anymore, a week after using this moisturizer I noticed the difference. My face has brightend, my fine lines have disappeared and the moisturizing is making my skin more soft and youthfull. I can't live without it! It also turns out to be cheaper than all the big brandnames I have used before.PS: Since the moisturizing is a bit heavy, you just need a tiny amount."
4,Ehh,"Well I thought the product would be much bigger cause the box picture just makes me thing its huge. Guess I should of known 2oz is not much. The smell of the product I like, it smells like a field of flowers. Now I haven't seen anything different with my skin I'm not sure if my skin was already soft or what but I still like the product."
3,I laughed,"This kind of movie is meant for an afternoon of laughs, and it delivered for me. I fail to understand those who would like movies to tippy-toe around racism. Race jokes help to remove the power from the unmentionable in this society. If you enjoy this kind of thing, you would not be dissappointed. It looks like the actors all had fun making this one. Thankyou. Why do I give only three points? It is not high art, and that is OK too."
1,Wish I could minus stars - one is too much,"I thought I would be nice and rent this movie for my girlfriend who happens to a hair dresser. We made it twenty minutes into this horror before she insisted we turn it off, which was fine with me because at the five minute mark I was preferring the eternal lake of fire to this absolute drivel.If there was humor in the movie it must be subliminal. I highly recommend this movie to twelve year old and under girls who love the whole ghetto craze that is now popular. Also to the brain dead who would laugh at anything."
3,Lady's version of Barbershop!,"After the brothas' got their chance, the sistas' get to show off their stuff. Queen Latifah continues to show her worth as an actress with this funny and entertaining comedy. I thought the ending was sort of a let down. However, this film is still a good one!"
3,Fluff piece but enjoyable,"Queen Latifah plays a hairstylist tired of working for her pretentious boss, starts her own place and deals with problems as they come along. I think Queen Latifah wants to break down stereotypes and is telling the audience not to judge people so quickly. And she's talking to everybody. Black and white people. You have a southern white woman who can dance with the best, a black guy who might or might not be gay, a gay man who isn't what he seems and so on and so forth.I thought this was a fun movie to watch if you don't want to think just watch. And Kevin Bacon is wonderful as Jorge, the gay beauty shop owner. I bet he really had fun with that role!"
4,"""Down It Latifah's Way""","""Queen Latifah"" is in the house with her fabulous Hair Salon. She returns back to the set as ""Gina"". *Beauty Shop* is a spin-off fromBarber Shop 2. If you enjoyed watching *Barber Shop 1 & 2* then you will enjoy Beauty Shop. Check-out how the women do it there way.IT""S ALOT OF FUN!!!!"
2,Isn't funny,"Even with a really great cast, Beauty Shop fails to deliver. It's not funny at all. I was expecting more coming from so many big names."
3,It works OK,"The adapter seemed to be what you would expect for the price. I am concerned that the plastic threads to mount to lens may wear out after a few usages. It does take a bit of experimentation to get good results. Once the adapter is set, you may want to put some tape on it to keep it from rotating. I copied a box of 601 slides in about 4 hours, my first try, and in reviewing them, to get good results, you will need to make individual adjustments on each slide."
3,Works ok - needs +2 close-up with it for filling the frame,"I have Sony A33 and think this would be helpful for Nikon dslr users.The slide copier works with 18-55mm lens at 55mm on Sony A33. The images are ok to good quality (not great). Slide doesn't take up the whole frame. I used a +2 close-up filter/lens on my 55-200mm lens so it would focus ok (can't without it) and I could zoom in to fill the viewfinder (about 70mm) or zoom more to crop the slide. The rotating end with the slide is stiff and have to hold the other end when aligning slide. This is cheap China plastic stuff. My slide duplicator from the 90's for film or full frame dslr's is metal and has a zoom built in to it, much better quality feeling. As stated this slide copier does work (don't expect much for $30), but has issues."
2,Problems,"I was having problems with my Optecka HD2 inserting slides untll one of the four guide/tension spring inside the slide slot broke loss and fell out of the duplicator. After disassembling to see if I could reinstall the spring, no go. I did discover that CHEAP is not right word for Optecka build quality. Without the spring getting in the way of the slides the duplicator is usable. (I may remove the other upper spring)If you can find one for $15 or less, buy it."
2,Good idea but poor engineering,"I found this item to be worth the money to digitize my valued slides, after much fooling around to make it work, but of ""dollar store"" value when it comes to quality engineering and practicality. To focus on each slide you must be able to turn the camera focus ring, which then turns the slide holder off its horizontal plane. If the holder pivot point had slightly looser toleraces it would be easy to adjust that part with two fingers. Instead it takes both hands to avoid torquing the camera lens. I finally left the ""contraption"" one thread loose on the lens barrel, placed the slide holder end on a solid horizontal surface and was able to focus that way with probably 80% focusing success. If you want to fool with it you can get satisfactory results, just don't be in a hurry. I think the price for this copier as is should be more in the $9.95 range. If the person who developed this is reading, you have a good idea but it needs refinement!"
3,"Not bad, could have been better.",The movie starts off kind of slow but gets a little better as time goes. It does give you a grim prospective at what the Soviets went thru during their time in Afganistan and how they cope with the situations brought on by a hostile enviroment with equally hostile enemy. Not a bad movie to add to your collection but could have been produced a little better.
5,Good story and great bluray,The story is nicely done with really good bluray quality. Must buy for war fans.
3,Russians gone amiss,I found this film to be a bit redundit despite it's supposed histoical nature. The redundancy I am commenting on is the ' last stand' type of heroism and the buildup is a bit crude and same ol' same ol' cliche' that is used over and over. I suppose this IS the case for combat films but this is lacking in debt. I did enjoy the film but there are far better out there.CA
3,GREAT MOVIE BUT NOT TRUE HD VIDEO,THE MOVIE WAS GREAT AND I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE STORY OR THE PRODUCTION. BUT IT IS LISTED AS A BLUE RAY AND ONE WOULD ASUME THAT BLUE RAY (BD) WOULD BE A 1080P RESOLUTION. IT IS NOT. IT IS 480P WHICH IS ONE STEP ABOVE NORMAL NTSC 480I. I WAS GOING TO COMPLAIN TO AMAZON BUT FOR THE FEW DOLLARS DIFFERENCE IN THE PRICE IT WASN'T WORTH IT.
2,No good !,"I purchased this movie on seeing the previews ! It looked really good a great war movie ! I was very wrong ! The movie I knew was in Russian and that is fine, I like foreign films. However the acting was poor, more comic than depicting anything realistic. The movie was boring taking almost the full hour before anything significant happened. Even then it was just stupid, a plane taking off gets hit by a mujahadine surface to air missile and then returns to its landing strip only to run into petrol drumms that lined the airstrip ! I mean really how lame. The fight sequence was poor, just all unrealistic situations. You can watch this once I guess, but then forget the 2 hours of your life you just wasted. If you want to see a better Afghanistan film from a Russian view point get 'The Beast of War' its older...but much better !"
1,not for me,"After reading the reviews, I thought I'd take a chance with this movie. After about 8 minutes, I turned it off.9th Company is rated R, but so isBeneath Hill 60. Yet both of these movies couldn't be more different with respect to language.The R rating is for strong bloody warfare, pervasive language, some sexuality/nudity, and drug use. Not family friendly at all. During the first 8 minutes, you'll notice the language right away; from that point, I knew it was all downhill.There are quality war/military movies out there, but this is not one of them.To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on ""Listmania! Lists""."
4,Good one - definitely don't pass this one by!,"This is a true story of the author's father, whose passion for rocks (even when other people teased him gently about it) eventually led him to become director of a museum and, in her own words, ""probably the happiest man I ever knew"".I love this one beyond belief. It's very sweet and nostalgic.I will say that it's probably better suited for the older end of the 4-8 range. It's a bit wordy, and some of the details about their lives - much of the book takes place during the Depression - are going to go right over the heads of the younger ones."
1,Terrible transfer!!! Do not buy this!,"I have about 4000 DVDs and have seen bad transfers in my life. This DVD is one of the worst. The color is washed away, it is fogy and it is in 1.33:1 but should be in 2.35:1. I just started to watch the film and don't know if I will watch any more. So if you care for picture quality (like I do) then stay away from this DVD. I'm writing this short review because I wish someone had warned me about the transfer before I bought it."
5,Inspirational Read,"""The strength to live a life of nonconformity is a virtue."" I think that quote sums up this book very well. It's about getting the life you want and not simply accepting the life that falls before you. The book is funny and witty, it has moments that caused tears as well. It left me wanting more. I think that anyone would enjoy this book. It's a quick read and Pam has an amazing ability to draw the reader in so that they can experience a little piece of heaven as well."
4,A Deliberate Life,An inspiring story told with ease about the challenges and satisfaction of life in an Alaskan homestead in the harshest yet most beautiful conditons. The courage to attempt that life and the determination to succeed are so understated that the reader's own conclusions reinforce the truth.
5,"A treasured classic with beautiful fashion, women, and powerful men","Ok it is definitely a girl's movie but the storyline rings true to me of the escapades of Hollywood. I loved it. Really hope to see this in a DVD format cause the quality of the VHS tape is bad. Romance, spectacular fashion and beautiful people make this a perfect setting for Jaclyn Smith."
3,Better than the first two parts.,Unlike the other two novels B-boy blues and second time around. This novel had a story line. I really enjoyed this one.Too bad it can't stand alone from the other two
4,Industry Standard,"There are a few products with more features and probably a few that easier to use but you probably wont find anything with both. I couldn't find anything more recent than 2004 so they may have stopped making this but at least for now, this has all the features I need for the time being."
5,Family Lawyer 2004 Home and Business Deluxe,"I love this product. As a matter of fact, I had an older version which I used quite often and decided to update it as it has the most recent laws by state. I have used it to prepare Wills for myself and several family members, for Bills of sale for vehicles and boats and many other legal documents. It is extremely easy to use since all you do is select the document and run through a questionnaire, then the software prepares the document for you. It has saved me alot of money in legal fees."
5,AJ's Family Lawyer 2004 Review,I have just recently used this product to update my personal medical records and etc. The software is truly in depth and easy to use with the built in interviewer process.
2,Many Technical Problems,"This could have been a great software program to own. There are several useful forms no matter what your situation is and it is easy to use except.....it won't save certain files. And if you get an error under a user name that user profile is corrupted so you have to start all over. I gave the product the benefit of the doubt, that I had possibly done something wrong, but when I tried the same files on a different user it did the same thing. Even when I set up 2 new clean users it wouldn't let me switch back and forth. I am ditching this version and getting the 2006 version hoping they have worked out the technical issues."
2,Not the best book for audio,"I bought this to do some professional studying on a long drive. The audio quality, reader, etc. is good. The audio chapters match the book's chapters so navigation within 10-15 minutes is difficult. The biggest problem is that the book depends on graphs and illustrations and often refers to them in the text. There are frequent, ""As you can see from the chart..."", ""Notice this pattern's similarity to the last..."", etc. Just not a good book for translation to audio."
4,Ms. Brown keeps surprising me with her amazing talents.,"Only Sandra Brown will put together the most unexpected couple, step mom & step son. But the story was so beautifully woven that I don't mind at all the weirdness of the situation. Although Caroline was married to Rink's father, she had been Rink's lover even before she got acquainted with Roscoe. Only years after Rink left her to marry somebody else, did she chose the father. For those who are familiar with SB's other books, the relationship between Caroline and Rink resembles Schyler & Cash in ""Slow Heat in Heaven""; the secondary characters, Mary Jane and Steve are Janellen & Bowie in ""Where There's Smoke"" only for Mary Jane and Steve, SB went deeper with their love story. Quite a treat for the readers. Two romances in one book - you won't be disappointed."
1,Over-achiever,"This book starts out with promise, and kept me wondering what really happened to the lovers that kept them apart. Other than the supsense of finding out what really happened between Caroline and Rink, there was nothing good about this novel. The secondary characters seem pointless, as if Brown only included them in her novel to fill space and add more pages to this book. With character names like Rink, Roscoe, and Granger, Brown tries too hard to make this into a romance. There is no distinguished climax to this story, other than Caroline becoming pregnant. I was always taught in English class that stories should have climaxes, and shame on the publishers for not noticing that there is none. It was a big let down to receive this book, which kept me in supsense for a while, and read as nothing came of it. The characters aren't very likeable and Caroline is not the heroine one might expect her to be."
4,sony street style walkman,this unit woked good. i used it for working in the yard. I have a small to medium head and the unit stayed in place like i had hoped. reception isnt that great but for the price it worked well. Im going to be considering the mp3 walkman in the future.
4,fast paced sampling of Irish dance,"The video is best if the viewer has some background in Irish dance. The video moves extremely quickly if you are unacquainted beforehand with some steps. There is a sampling of both soft shoe and hard shoe. You can dance in your socks for the soft shoe reel, but you will need to buy your own hard shoes for the second part of the video."
4,star trek TNG Gold shirt,"''Geordi give me a full inspection through trial and error of that uniform.""""Well Captain, It holds up great not too tight,but of course I ordered an size larger to eliminate such an probelm."" The color is more darker and is accurate to starfleet uniform regulations.""Is there any flaw to this uniform?""""minor sir, the collar seems to have no colored pipeing around it and my visor picks up loose threads now and then."" The main consird on my personel behalf is the pips that come with it are not pips at all, but some kind of paper which needs to be Iron on.""""Well what do you think Number One?""""It sounds good for somthing you would wear at an party or to play around in, but if your really into the code of starfleet then I perfer else wear."""
5,HOT,This song like the name says is hot. Snoop made is best song in my oppinion. R&G is JUST A MASTERPIECE.
1,Drop It Like It's NOT!!,If I could rate this zero I would. This is snoop's dumbest song ever. It doesn't even make sense. Don't Buy This
5,Sisters In Song,"When I first heard the second track on this cd- titled, The Center of My Life, I began to cry from the beauty of it. I felt it directly in the heart chakra. I reach for this cd time and time again. It is simply from the heart and channelled from GOD.There is so much peace from listening to it."
5,The second best movie ever made,"The best movie ever made is a magical little film known as Carnosaur. This sequel is a credit to that name. It is very unoriginal (the plot is a huge rip-off of Aliens) but it is enormously entertaining. It has interesting characters, good acting, good (and fun) special effects, and a script that works. The best thing about this film though is the setting. The uranium mine where this film takes place feels genuinely prehistoric. You can actually picture dinosaurs roaming about the mine quite naturaly. It seems like the perfect home for the modern dinosaur. The mine is also delightfuly creepy. Anyway, the bottom line is that Carnosaur 2 is the second best movie of all time and it must be seen by EVERYONE!"
3,Somewhat Better Than The First One...,"CARNOSAUR 2 opens w/ an electrician in an underground facility being killed off by an unseen monster. Next, there's a scene in a bar (located in the same facility) where more deaths are caused by off-camera creatures. A special team of electricians is brought in to fix the damage done at the subterranean complex. Unfortunately, no one has bothered to inform them that this is a top secret military / government operation, and that there just might be a gaggle of hungry, man-eating dinosaurs on the loose! Our heroes find out soon enough, as they become tasty dino-treats. Will anyone survive this reptilian holocaust?? John Savage (The Killing Kind), Cliff De Young (Pulse), and all-around-tough-guy Don Stroud (The Amityville Horror) do most of the heavy lifting in this slow-building sequel. The finalé has a cool T-rex vs. earth-moving machine battle that (almost) makes the whole thing worthwhile. Best viewed while heavily sedated..."
2,The End shed all their technical proficiency and decided to be an ambient emo band.,"In a nutshell, The End shed all their technical proficiency and decided to be an ambient emo band. For emo, its really good music. But coming from their beginnings, this is a severe disappointment. When Transfer Trachea Reverberations From Point: False Omniscient, it was one of the most awesome recordings of that style for the time. Within Dividia was a step down, but still was gratifying. Elementary is such a turn for the worst, I don't know how it can be justified. For an extreme band, this deserves no listening or stars at all. For an emo band, this is better than the eye-liner boys. But if that were the direction they wanted to go, they should have changed their name."
5,The Leadership Solution,"Jim Shaffer, in this work, really connected the dots for me! His premise, that it all starts with effective communications, is dead on! As a former CEO and whose time is now spent as an outside director for a number of companies and as counselor to large company CEOs, this work is both relevant for today's leaders in today's warp speed economy and timeless in its approach.Shaffer has crafted a very readable, yet content rich handbook for anyone either presently running a company or with dreams to someday run one! (In fact, this work is an excellent handbook for CEOs wanting to develop ""bench strength"" on the management team. Simply use Leadership Solutions as the textbook for a company-run academy for those up and comers selected for bigger jobs in the company's future. So many books are long on theory, short on application. Shaffer's approach is exceptionally practical...and applicable. It can be reread time and again."
5,The Most Clever Book I Have Ever Read !,"This mystery book is written in such an original style! It never stops surprising you until the end.David Ellis is by far one of the most interesting writers of crime novels,he is the most clever and entertaining."
4,Page turner,"This is the second of David Ellis' books that I've read and enjoyed this one as much as the first. The characters are interesting and developed so that you can identify with them. It is written in reverse order which made it challenging to read and remember from one chapter to the next. A very interesting concept. It took some concentration to keep the thread of the story going, but it was interesting enough that it was enjoyable to do so. He is one of the better writers and glad I found him."
3,in the company of Liars,I read mostly mysteries and similar and David Ellis is one of my favorite authors so I am always glad when there is a new book out by him.
1,Literary device didn't work for me,"I put up with the reverse chronology for about 70 pages. Too much work, frankly."
1,Thin and Thinner,"Perhaps if Mr. Ellis had written this corny simplistic farce in Chinese, we could have not only gone back in time, but sideways (as in right-to-left)."
1,I gave up,I frequently check reviews of novels at this site but have never written a review myself. I couldn't resist commenting on In the Company of Liars. I've reached page 134 and have decided to call it quits (although I'll read a couple of chapters near the end to see if I've really missed anything). The reverse chronology approach is maddening. This was the first David Ellis novel I've ever read; I fear it will be the last.
2,OK,"This latest from David Ellis is a good trick in form, turning the worked-over linearity of standard thriller lit inside out, upside down and backwards. It's fascinating to see the storyteller work around his gimmick so carefully. It's too bad that style and any chance of curled intrigue took such a back seat in the process. ""In the Company of Liars"" is burdened with cliches. The prose is wooden and reminiscent of the laziest crime writing. Thank goodness it was at least a little more than the sum of its parts."
4,Great bag and a great deal,"I bought this bag together with an extra battery for the same price a battery by itself cost at Best Buy. The bag is big enough to hold the camera and a couple other small lenses as well as accessories. It is not large enough to hold more than one big zoom, but can hold my 70-210 okay."
3,Strange...,"A very quirky novel, sorta sci-fi, with tongue-in-cheek writing that interacts with the author and reader. A samurai cat goes into hell to kill off Satan and find his sidekick. From there it gets real strange... :-)"
4,Sold by Best Deal Supply,if you buy this product from amazon will come in clear jewel cases not in black jewel cases.. see the photos.
1,heores of might,Wasn't able to play in my computer as it would not load. found that I can't rate as didn't play it.
4,Why you should and shouldn't by this game,"Why should you buy it:It is slightly cheaper than the more complete version of the game: ""Tribes of the East.""It has the word's ""Don't Panic"" printed in large friendly letters... okay I'm kidding. :)You like playing campaigns, or single player (The campaign isn't bad.)You like the Heroes of Might and Magic series.You like turn based RPG games with lots of stories.Why you shouldn't buy it:They fixed very few bugs after it was released (If you can't stand bugs, don't get it)They made a complete version of the game that is much less buggy: ""Tribes of the East""I'll now leave it up to you to decide if you want it or not."
5,A good sequel!,"BACK OF THE BOX:Based on the chilling story, 'Children of the Corn' by Stephen king, REVELATION is the next shocking chapter in this ever-poplar series of sspence-thrillers! When calls to her eccentric grandmonther go unanwered, Jamie Lowell is shocked to discover that her grandmother's last known adress is a condemned tenement building overrunned by ncontrolled children! But as Jamie slowly uncovers the truth behind her grandmother's mysterios dissapearance, she merely disturbs a powerful evil that now wishes to destroy Jamie as well!When I saw this movie for $4.00 on VHS at my local thrift store, I took it home and expected the worst. I popped in the tape and was amazed. This sequel had almost nothing to do with the original, bt it was a great film! The special effects cold have been a bit better, but it is still a good movie! But only rent or buy it if you are a DIE-HARD COTC fan!"
2,Carnosaur,These movies are definently low budget films. It's not that I think the movies are all that bad but they could have been a lot better if 1 they had better acting and 2 there was a better budget for affects and so forth. I recomend you get Jurassic Park if you want a really good movie.
3,"Hey, look at that! ANOTHER one!","Okay, I LOVE both the Jurassic Park movies. Carnosaur 3 delivers, but in NO way like the Jurassic Park movies. Carno3 was aiight,the special effects were kinda stiff and unconvincing, and the acting wasn't all that. (Except Rick Dean. He was AWESOME in this movie! I'm glad Jon Winfrey brought him back from Carnosaur 2 as a different character.) If you want my opinion on the SPFX, I think they shoulden't have shown the dinosaurs. They should have shown just the shadows, or hands, or just an eye or something. That goes for Carno2 as well, but not the original Carnosaur. NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING could have been done to help that movie! But, anyway. Yeah, the SPFX suck, but they're very, very fun, and the gore scenes are, well...uh, GOREY, but that's cool! That's VERY cool! If you're gonna see this movie, watch it in the dark. It'll help the movie ALOT!"
1,Waste of time,"Get out of NMT program while you can. There are no jobs in the field!!! :( Even if your mid way through the program, GET OUT! You're waisting your money and life."
1,Sadden,I was very disappointed to find out that the movie WILL NOT play in the United States and is formatted to work only in Asia :( So we are unable to watch it all
5,Great Inspiration Fiction,"If I could give this book 10 stars, I would...I found it to be quite heart warming and different from the regular run-of-the-mill romances...The beginning of the book was eyecatching and it kept my total attention until the end...which happened to be at 2am in the morning...Kudos to Ms. Kate Welsh...Keep them coming!"
4,Kubrick liked this,"Stanley Kubrick always wanted to make a movie of this book. See the the massive Taschen book ""The Kubrick Archives"""
2,You'll Wonder Why,"I do have to admit that I did laugh out loud a couple of time. But mostly I wondered why I was reading this book, other that a relative recommended it. I think it's an acquired taste..."
3,Great Story Behind the Story,I first read this book almost forty years ago and was truly entertained but a lot has happened since then and on my second reading I found it just ok. Don't ask me what changed my mind. Life has a way of taking the shine off of most of everything. One of the most interesting parts of the book is its history. The author's mother found the manuscript after he had died and she began a relentless search until she found a publisher. Mother's love.
4,A good laugh,"This is one of the greatest written ""humorous"" books I've ever read. I have that in quotes because it is also quite sad. I especially liked the interaction between Ignatious and his mother. I was a bit dissapointed in the ending though."
1,Talent? What talent?,"The amazon review says that had the author lived, his critics and fans would have had the opportunity to determine if his talent was genuine or a fluke. Oh, really? Who said he had any ""talent""? What I found in this book was pure amateurism -- in plot, character development, atmosphere, you name it. If Dunces demonstrates genius, then the Three Stooges are on par with Chaplin. The amazon review also says this drivel cannot be easily dismissed. Again, says who? This is one ""book"" I plan to forget as soon as possible."
3,Dunce indeed,"I enjoyed some of this book's humor but after working in the social service field all my life what some may find funny I found tiring and based more on reality than some might believe. There are hundreds of men out there who fit the the main character's profile who have frustrated more than one well intentioned caseworker not to mention the ""dunces"" families. There is comic genius to this novel but how much is creative writing is at issue. Nick Hornby's a ""Long Way Down"" made me laugh a lot more and had much more to say!! It's sad the author died but I sense his genius was overblown by critics based on the circumstances of his untimely demise."
1,If I could give it less than one star I would,"Bought this for $1 and feel like that was too much. Supposedly it one some book award, but I can't see why. No plot,crude, unsympathetic characters. Not worth your time."
5,All Time Favorite,"I AM CURRENTLY FINISHING UP MY FOURTH READING OF CONFEDERACY. I LOVE TO GET INTO EACH CHARACTER WHEN READING IT TO MY WIFE. I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED HARDER WHEN READING ANY BOOK. IT ONLY GETS BETTER EACH TIME. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT ON FILM, BUT I CAN SEE IT PLAYING IN MY HEAD EACH TIME. AWESOME.IF YOU HAVE NOT READ IT, YOU MUST."
2,"Man, what tough going !","What a slog it is trying to get through this book. I'm nearly there (I've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this)... the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends, and the mostly rave reviews it's got here. Ignatius Reilly, the main character is interesting enough (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring, I find myself flicking on the pages to see how far I have to go before the story gets back to Ignatius again. I keep thinking ""OK, the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon""...there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the Pulitzer Prize. I'm at a loss to explain its popularity."
1,the moron was masturbating!,"I like comedic books, dark comedies, and the like. I picked this book up because it was referred to with one of my top 5 books:A Fraction of the Whole. I found nothing funny in A Confederacy of Dunces, no relevance to Fraction of the Whole, and when I read the part where the moron is masturbating I threw it across the room. This is not even dark humor, it's disgusting, the characters were utterly pathetic creatures, wastes of space and a despicable example of the human condition."
1,Insufferable even for a book nut,"I read voraciously; I almost read for a living in almost every genre there is. I'm not one of the majority of Americans who read an average of one book a year. At least you know where I'm coming from when I say that I barely made it through the first 30-40 pages of this tome. It reminded me of old high school friends who constantly tried to make faces or hoot out tiresome jokes or recite plays on words that left the rest of us either groaning in disgust or avoiding the person entirely.I have no idea how this won a prestigious award or garnered so many positive reviews. Maybe our tastes have sunk this low that Toole's suicide somehow places him in that rarefied air of the great ""misunderstood"" writer who was really trying to communicate complex truth in seemingly ridiculous narrative. No, I think it was a foolish man writing foolishness."
5,Hilarious,"This book gets better every time I read it. Toole develops the characters wonderfully and the dialogue is tremendous. Ignatius is a man born in the wrong century and he gives a good funny critique of this one. Although Fortuna spins his wheel down through most of the book, at the end it takes an upward turn. This is the only book J K Toole wrote as an adult so savor this one fine read. There is an e mail discussion group on this book. Order this one now. You will find yourself reading and re-reading this classic."
5,Delusions of Adequacy,"Delusions of Adequacy describes anyone who fails to find humor in this book ....The few parts where the book is stretched out a bit much, some of the journal entries of our working boy, can be skipped over without missing a thing.I've read it twice - recently and 7 years ago. It was a riot each time.Sincerely and with kind regards,- The Central Scrutinizer"
2,my review,"After reading A Confederacy of Dunces I was really disappointed in the book. The novel was supposed to be humorous. However, as I started to read more into the book I felt really annoyed with the characters in the book, and with the book itself. A theme that the author, John Kennedy Toole, tries to display is that the characters are foolish and unhappy because people in society aren't helping one another and that is a major reason why they are unhappy.The characters, especially Ignatius, annoyed me because they weren't unhappy just because no one was helping them, it was also the fact that they didn't try to do something for themselves and be happy. Few people today in society will help someone so they can make their lives happier. My opinion is that this is a book that I could not read over again. I do not recommend this book if you want to laugh all it did was irritate me."
5,"Just read it. How it escaped me all these years? Not sure. Had a friend recommend it, then I devoured it.","Ignatius J. Reilly is the best main character I've come across. It took me around 50 pages or so for that ""ah ha"" moment. Once you start to place all of Ignatius's idiosyncrasies, you're in for some very special laughs. I was depressed when the book had to end, because I was simply enjoying too much, and have never read anything quite like it. You may also enjoy Charles Bukowski, if you like this book.If you have tastes that differ from top 20 best seller list, 5th grade reading level stuff, this is for you. If you really want to know that this book is great, give it to someone who only reads Dan Brown type novels, and they will despise this...then you know you've got something great!"
1,An affront to taste & decency!,"Amazon's system of applying a star rating to ""A Confederacy of Dunces' is an affront to taste and decency. They must be thrashed immediately! And me too, for writing this."
1,A sick story,A Confederacy of DuncesI chose the lowest rating becausethis book is a complete waste of time.Why was it published?
1,Dull and Insulting,"I found this book very bland. I suppose it is supposed to be a humourus book, but I often began to wonder, not knowing anything about the author, if there wasnt more truth than fiction in this book. This has been one of the worst books I have read. I would never recommend this book to anyone."
1,There is only one good thing about this book.,"If you need to add words to your lexicon, this is the book for you. It will not entertain you, it will not make you feel smarter, it will not make people think you are smarter...after they read it too. The lead character is the type of person everyone can hate. The plot line isn't even started until the 90th page. It is filled with long-winded diatribes from the exceptionally iratating lead character. [...]"
5,The best - literally - I've ever read,"From the characterizations to the dialog to the wit - this is it. With lines like ""The Smithsonian Institution, that grab-bag of our nation's refuse"" to ""the air conditioning... exhaled the Levi's carbon dioxide and cigarette smoke and ennui"" you know this is no ordinary novel. Funny, serious, tragic, entertaining. You will simultaneously loathe and love the protagonist, one Ignatius J.Riley. I'll overlook some obvious plot loose ends, ...the book was published after his death."
1,"Ah, no.","Obviously there are two camps of people that reviewed this book, those that loved it and those that hated it. Not many in between. I'm not sure where the camp of lovers are coming from. This book was not funny. I repeat . . . not funny! I didn't laugh once through the first half of it which is how far I could stand to read. It portrays a pathetic fat slob of a jerk that deserves all the bad that life deals him. It's slow, it's pointless, it's really hard to understand why this is a popular book. Please read the one star reviews as well as the fives before quessing if you'd be a lover or a hater. Yuk."
4,Good therapy?,"There are few joys more special than laughing uncontrollably in places you really shouldn't. This book wasn't just a great read, it was great medicine."
5,I've read the one-star reviews,"I'd like to address the criticisms in the relatively few one-star reviews of Dunces. Yeah, it's a story about a fat guy and his drunk mother. But if you didn't discern the love that Toole had for these and the other misfits in the book, you weren't paying attention. Great literature can take many forms, one of which is the loving and skillful portrayal of one's characters, farts and all. Is The Canterbury Tales disqualified due to its obsession with flatulence? No. Do we ignore In Cold Blood because of the unsavory main characters? Of course not. It is my life's mission to turn 100 people on to this book."
1,a dud,"Although I'm usually pretty critical of books, it takes a lot in order for me to give a book only one star. I picked this one up because it had won a Pulitzer and I was going to New Orleans soon and wanted some relevant (fictional) reading. I don't deny that Toole had some ambitious aims when he began this book--and yes, I agree it's a satire. But I didn't find it that effective because I could barely recognize humanity in these people. I usually think of satire as a social criticism involving humor and exaggeration. This book is filled with exaggerations--but I really didn't find it funny at all. Moreover, I could see what types of connections the author was trying to make with his critique, but I didn't find them at all compelling or even believable. In fact, I found the casting to be trite and ill-formed and am forced to agree with previous reviewers in saying that the majority of the book seemed redundant and annoying."
1,Can't understand the positives on this one,I was really looking forward to this book but then found myself force reading to finish it. Part of the problem is that I really took a dislike to the main character - a completely worthless individual who all you learn from is how not to be. If you like to be inspired by stories this is not for you.(I didn't even find it amusing - are fart jokes really worth a Pulitzer?)
1,The worst book I've ever read also,"Hated every page. Boring. Impossible-to-like characters, annoying dialog, and very little plot. I suspect that Ignatius J. Reilly describes the late author; he was indeed an extremely unhappy young man. I hope I never pick up drivel like this book ever again. That this book was given any literary prize whatsoever is flat-out astonishing."
3,I've read better,"I was surprised this won a Pulitzer. All of the main characters are repugnant & lame. I was rooting against them all, except in the last part when I was rooting for the lesser of the evils."
3,Good,"As much as I hate to divide a novel into neat compartments, this one surely deserves such a treatment. The undeniable core of the famous book - inhabited supremely by Ignatius J. Reilly - represents some of the finest imagination and humanity put to paper in American literature. Nothing like a deliciously insane, absurdly overeducated, overfed main character to pillar a story. Ignatius is elegantly drawn, his every movement and word perfectly, wildly entertaining. The other parts of the book sag and bore by comparison. Jumbled, ugly, dead-end dialogue, an abundance of overly silly misadventures and a story arc that never snaps to life."
5,Great book,"It's a great book, really funny, makes you laugh all along. The main character is a complete freak that loves to make other people lives a complete joke, but he really means it.Really recommend it, gives you an idea of the life on New Orleans around the 60s.Dont doubt it. Buy it!!!"
3,"Decent, but Doesn't Live Up to the Hype","It's generally considered a comic masterpiece, and although I found a good deal of it amusing I also found it somewhat troubling. Underneath the humor author John Kennedy Toole's portrayal of all the characters is kind of cruel, taking all of their negative traits and highlighting them as strongly as he could. The implicit view of the book is also bleak; even if the characters weren't all fools it wouldn't much matter how well they would try to accomplish anything, because they would still be subjected to luck and forces outside of their control. The book's humor is a kind of schadenfreude."
5,"Oh, Fortuna, you wench!","I have never been affected by a book such as the influence this book has introduced into my life. I loved Ignatius, and I am so depressed. I have just finished this book, and now I am without Ignatius, Miss Trixie, Myrna, et al. How will I go on? Oh, Fortuna, the wheel you have spun sends me spiraling down into the depths of apoplexy and discombobulation! I am incomplete without the wisdom imparted by Ignatius, and I morne the loss of John Kennedy Toole. I will make it my life's mission to spread the word of this work. I am so wrecked right now, in distress. And to think, it was written with a cliff-hanger ending. Oh, Fortuna, you wench!"
5,Don't we all know someone like Ignatius,"During high school there were always people who had their own special version of looking at the world. That Ignatius is 30 doesn't really matter. He is one of those guys who try but fail, who think the whole world is against them and that they are the chosen one to end it. Yet they always get into the wrong situations.This book is great! Hilarious situations and great descriptive writing. Too bad he only wrote two books..."
1,Maybe I Just Didn't Get It,"I've been accused of having a sense of humor outside the mainstream. Reading all of the reviews below makes me believe this may be true. I don't know why, but I just didn't get it! I thought the story was stupid and boring. I got about 2/3 the way through and just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Oh well, different strokes, as they say..."
1,NOOOOOOO! SPARE US!!!!!!,"I didn't like this book and I finished it out of determination. Personally, I found the plot slow and ripetitive, the characters more similar to jonsonian humours than real persons. The atmosphere of the whole book reminded me of a famous Italian comic strip ""Alan Ford e il Gruppo TNT"" (Alan Ford and the TNT Groups). Italian readers know what I'm talking about and will see this is no compliment. I grant the author a deep knowledge of medieval culture, though, and a good hand at mastering his own mother tongue. I wonder whether, had he lived, he would have written something really good."
5,"Definitely a ""read again"" (and again and again) selection","Although the ""protagonist"" of this novel is a uniquely obnoxious guy-you-love-to-hate, I found myself growing quite fond of the pompous, over-educated, under-achiever, Ignatius J. Reilly less than half way through the book. In fact, all the characters that populate Ignatius' world are extremely flawed but somehow likable. Make no mistake, you would probably not want to have any of these folks as friends or family, but they are certainly fun to ""watch"". Ignatius is totally oblivious to the wave of chaos he creates everywhere he goes. Sometimes I felt it would be more appropriate to cry at the situations Ignatius created, but I always wound up laughing instead. Indeed, I laughed out loud almost the entire time I was reading this book. Love, love, LOVED it! Definitely a ""read again"" (and again and again) selection"
2,I'm a dunce for sticking with it,"This book was recommended to me by a good friend, and I trust his literary taste. At least I did until NOW. True, I listened to this book, and the reader was just passable. My biggest complaint about this book is that there are exactly zero characters that I warmed up to (Just thinking about that - UGH!) or wanted to hear from or wanted to know more about. I understand it is supposed to be funny - but trust me, this book is not funny like the early Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum books. It is not funny in any way. I admit it, I just don't get the attraction!"
5,A+ of a Book,"Easily one of the finest pieces of non-fiction I have read. This captivating story makes its characters members of the household. Intricately twined, the multi-story-lined text will be one you will want to read again and again."
2,hooey!,"All you ranting people chanting ""TEN!!!"" must have read a different book than I did. I guess I just had a hard time laughing at a fat person and his drunk mother. This book made me incredibly uncomfortable. I am not surprised it won the Prize, the story about the death of the author even won me over before I was mired down in the dull goings on in the actual book. Toilet humor? You could call it that. But not very GOOD toilet humor. I will watch the South Park kids if I want fart jokes."
1,would give this book a negative 5 stars if possible,So glad to see I'm not the only person who hates this book.Not much more can be said about this terrible book then what my other fellow 1 star reviewers have said. it's all true and I agree with them all. I got this as a library book because of my book club. So dissapointed! Glad I did not pay for this piece of junk!This book is NOT FUNNY.Hate Hate Hate Ignatius! Such a loser! I got a headache halfway through chapter 2.I tried and tried to keep reading out of repect for the Pulitzer Prize rating(and my sister who picked this book). Hoping beyond hope that the books characters would redeem themselves. Never happened.I personally like to read books that are interesting. I cannot stay interested in a book where I absolutely cannot stand the main character. It's like Catcher in the Rye all over again. Ick!
4,for fans of Joesph Heller,"The charector is a little too annoying, and maybe that makes this book so appealing to others. If you enjoyed ""Catch 22"" you should find this pleaseing after you get through the first third of the book. It definantly takes so time to pick up speed but finaly manages a strong gate through the end. Given the circumstances the book was written under, (a story as interesting as the book) this is a nice book that takes place in an time period of New Orleans that is rarely painted.The charector who lives in a self absorbed world where he could solve any problem if only anyone would listen to him, stumbles in and out of fringe social circles and environs haphazardly leaving a wake of confusion while remaining ignorant of his butterfly effect all the while.This would be a great introduction to dark humor and irony for a younger reader, but this may take a bit of pateince if you already have a firm background in Vonnegut, Heller, and the like."
4,Hilarious Satire,"It's Ignatius J. Reilly versus the French Quarter. It's Ignatius J. Reilly versus the erotic Myrna Minkoff. Ignatius is a severely overweight man with an intolerable problem with his pyloric valve. One wrong emotion and it clasps shut and traps odoriferous gases inside his gigantic body. A wheel of fortune spins to define Ignatius' next move. He is forced, for the first time, to work for his money in lieu of sponging off of his poor mother. The real world is cruel to him, but eventually he finds his calling as a hot dog vendor, pushing a cart with the words ""Twelve inches to paradise"" scribbled on it. This is the story of man who cannot be accepted and therefore cannot except. John Kennedy Toole was a genius of the novel. He writes as a contemporary Charles Dickens. His satirical style is serious yet hilarious at the same time. A Confederacy of Dunces is by far the greatest representative of society in the United States of America. One can do nothing but laugh out loud."
3,okay..,I bought this movie because my son has become obsessed with Land before Time. I got tired of watching the same 2 over and over again so I ordered about 5 different ones.My son loves LBT but I cannot tell you much about this story because this not one of our favorites. He is allowed to pick out which one he wants to watch and he hardly ever picks this one. So I cannot tell you much about this one as it was not that memorable to me. I do think it is kinda cute but just not a competator to some of the others.
3,It's Gravitation,"Art is one thing that throws me off a Manga. And the art is horrible. Though alot more graphic then the Anime (which is upsetting), I think the Anime wins hands down. The Manga is lacking in a few things and it's confusing but still worth it for a Fan of Yaoi."
4,Garth Brooks Story,"Have you ever wanted to know more about Garth Brooks, the country legend? If you have, then this is the book for you.The author shows that Garth loves people and loves performing for them. She includes interesting facts and finds justice to many rumors. As a person interested in music, I was pleased this biography told of how Garth started out as a music artist and of the trials and tribulations he had to go through. The author also included stories of ordinary people who have met Garth, and have witnessed what a great and caring person he is. She also wrote about the real life struggles of Garth and his wife, like each having to work two jobs to make ends meet.Although I enjoyed the book, I thought the author could have included more feeling and drama into it. She also could have included less statistics about his albums.After reading this, I have more understanding and admiration of Garth Brooks than I have ever had before."
1,Big thumbs down,"They could have done so much more with this game. For those who are fans of the franchise, you understand that it has a very cinematic feel which is missing from the game. The gameplay is clumsy and is difficult to get into without any backstory. Save your $$."
4,Happy Face :D,Great game for all Transformers fans! The game is based on the Armada series not G1. Great story concept with fun extras. Some of the voice actors are different from that of the cartoon. The game is really hard *coughcheatcodescough*
3,Mama Mia!!!!,Let me start with this brief summary.PROSGraphics-10 out of 10Levels-10 out of 10Storyline-10 out of 10CONSCamera-1 out of 10----------------------------------------------------------------
3,Wrong Spice,"I bought this CD because I enjoy exploring Music. Most of this CD however does not agree with me.The mixing sounds off; if not off, the spice is wrong for this type of serving.I definitely will NOT explore the balance of this series."
4,Knife is great but belt case is not,"Great knife! I really like the way it is built - rock solid, great fit and finish and good quality steel that seems to hold an edge very well. I also like the blade lock on this knife as it is just as easily manipulated with either hand, and it is very quickly deployed and safely locked into place with minimal effort...just what you want in that moment an emergency requires a good, solid knife. The only problem with it is that it comes with a very cheaply made ballistic nylon belt case, which is much too large for the knife, and which comes with a flimsy, and easily breakable plastic belt clip. Mine broke within a week. Without a belt clip on the knife, you are forced to either carry this big knife in your pocket, or fork out more bucks for a decent belt case for it. Overall, I give the knife 5 stars, but the case only gets 1 star."
1,sizing inaccurate,"There were some warnings in the reviews,but I fugured adult xlarge meant just that. Wrong. The xlarge adult is woefully too small"
4,Not my usual scene,"Usually I love mystery/thriller/horror novels however a friend leant me a couple of Jackie Collins and I must say they are a perfect distraction and change. Her books are sexy and have so many sub stories running through them it enthralls you to find out whos doing who of hollywood. I always have this feeling that I should know which character represents who in real life because I'm sure some of the characters are based on real people ! They really draw you in and make you think about the characters I often say to myself ""No No don't do that you numbskull argh !"" Lovers and Gamblers has a surprising ending and the main character really gives everyone something to think about when he handles a bad situation. I also like how Jackie Collins really differentiates between sex and love."
3,Tuneful,"The songs are tuneful and several have two versions, Hebrew and English. Judy Rubenstein's voice is pleasant enough, although I found her Hebrew accentuations to be sub-par. But I listen to it fairly often as I try to learn the songs for the Seder."
1,Songs of the Seder or Dirges of the Seder?,"This CD sounds like it was designed for a Passover Seder just after a funeral. Passover should be a joyous, exciting and fun holiday. Many of the songs are usually uptempo, uplifting and inspirational. ""Songs of the Seder"" slows everything down and turns exciting songs into dark, slow, sad pieces. Hee Nay Mah Tov, Go Down Moses, Dah-yay-noo and others all sound as though they are on the wrong speed. We were extremely disappointed with this disk, particularly since we read such nice reviews of it on this site.By way of comparison, try Cindy Paley's ""A Singing Seder"" which is full of life. fresh and exciting."
5,Heyer is always a great bet!,"Although she cannot be called a great mystery plotter (the murderer is highly unlikely and there is a dire lack of clues), her characters make up for any defects. The lovely dispicable Randall, is hilarious one of my favorite Heyer unheroes. I prefer her Regencies but the mysteries are highly palatable as well."
3,So-so,"I only read the mysteries of GH if my library has them, but they are all rather unsatisfactory to me. They are full of despicable people, i.e the widowed mother in this one, but you knew she wouldn't end up being the murderer, though I sincerely wished something bad would happen to her. And the real killer, in all of her books, is always someone outside of the circle, even though the inner circle are packed full of motive. I also wished something bad would befell Guy, the selfish, idiotic son of aforementioned widow. Plus she always throws in a romance, which I do not need or like in mysteries. Her characters are cliches. The reason for the crimes end up being rather obscure and then the book comes to an abrupt halt."
4,a fun to read mystery,"Although Georgette Heyer is primarely known for her Regency romances, she was also a writer of my classical English mysteries. This one is certainly her best. Although the plot is not exactly brilliant (hence only 4 stars) the characters are up to her usual standards, esp as the odious hero Randall who you love to hate and hate to love. Very entertaining, not only for Heyer's many fans..."
5,Easy Transaction,"Found this transaction to be just perfect - the price was excellent, shipping was fast and I'm happy!"
3,"The same idea as the first, without the rawness and sparkle","The music for the second installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean, ""Dead Man's Chest"", is similar in style and presentation to the first. The key difference here is the loss of raw energy, sparkle, and surprise that the first film and its music had. The result is something that fans of the film will adore, but those of us who weren't so impressed by the second film will see as just another part of a mediocre attempt to recreate the magic of the first. Hans Zimmer isn't without great scores, though. I would recommend the score of ""King Arthur"", a powerful score featuring a lot of choral underscore and great action music. Much akin to Pirates in feel, with more originality and drive."
2,Not a very interesting book,"I didn't like this book much, but it looks like some people do. It has some good points, but on the whole rather flat. I've read better ones."
3,it grows on you,"I basically agree with the review by Encompassed Runner below: There are both pros and cons to this bible and that review summarizes them very well. The main problem I had with the bible was that some of the colors look very similar, especially in dim light. At first, all the colors seemed to strain my eyes. However, in time, I got used to the coloring system and now I really enjoy it. While I too have a system for marking the bible, it is nice to have one so thoroughly and professionally marked. The type is very clear and the references are good. I have gotten a lot of joy from searching the bible based on a particular ""color"" or theme. I found my bible at a deep discount; I would not pay full price for one. If you find a good price, get one!!"
5,Another great one,I had to dig deep in the Mingus oevre to find this and as always Mingus doesn't disappoint. Well worth your time and money. You might want to follow the previous reviewer's advice and do the iTunes download so you get that last 5 seconds of the last track.
5,Tim & Melissa fans,It's a wonderful movie that's still relevant today. You can't always go home but sometimes every once in a while you can and everything works out just fine.
5,A lovely christmas movie,"I had watched this movie on tv, loved it then, when I found the dvd on Amazon, I had to have it...I received it in just a few days after ordering, have already watched it, am so happy to have this in my collection, a movie to watch anytime of the year, if you haven't seen this movie, try it."
4,GOOD BUT NOT WORTH $31.00,I really like this movie. I've become a fan of Melissa Gilbert's movies as an adult and this one doesn't let me down. A nice holiday movie for anyone who still believes in the miracle of love. BUT..... it's not worth the outrageous $31.00 that sellers on Amazon are trying to sell it for. Shame on them for putting such a high price tag on this movie! I guess greed isn't reserved for executives in large corporations anymore.
2,GREEN LIGHT,Futuristic bomb focuses on sexy space pirates and a glowing green ball that turns people into zombies. Hon hum. The production values are low low budget. The acting atrocious and everything about this film reeks. I felt sorry for Steve Railsback whose once promising career has finally hit rock-bottom.
1,It was horribly boring.,The book stunk. EEEWWWWWW. It droned on and on about one thing. Like 40 pages of the book focus on fried eggs. Ughhhh.
1,This book wasn't deserving of such high regard,"My rateing should drop the average down a bit. I thought that the book showed little in the area of creativity, and the only interesting parts were when the story of aunt Ida unfurrled. I thought that the series of events between rayona and the preacher would have led to more of a dramatic conclusion then never hearing of him agian. I don't see why this book got any praise except for the fact that people are suckers for books about the trials and tribulations of minorities. Don't asume that I'm a racist, because really I'm not. I don't have any problem with the main charectures being indian (and rayona being mixed), but it shouldn't be aplied in the rating of the book.-- In my opinion this book would have only made two or three stars at most had it been about some white family. It shouldn't be that way."
1,Boring,"Boring. The idea to write from the three characters point of view could have been a good one, if something exciting had happened to any of them. I kept waiting for something but all it did was drag on and on."
3,Not too bad,"Readable: YesInteresting: A bitProfound Effect: NoneEntertainment Level: LowI didn't particularly get into it. It wasn't a bad book, but there was nothing about it that held my interest. The woven story aspect was fine. The plot was a bit interesting. Yet, there was nothing that pulled me in or made me want to keep reading."
1,This book was not good,"I read this book for my ""cultural expansion"" unit in english my sophmore year. The story was one of cultural stuggle, and generational understanding. The author delt with the topic in a way that tried to make the reader empathize with the main character, but made the character make so many unintellegent decisions that i found it hard to empathize with anyone in the book. This book also tried to portray the native american culture and show how it has decayed over the last few decades. While this is all well and good, the author made me feel as indifferent as a history book for their cause. Do not read this book."
5,You will probably read it twice,"This is a story that is told backwards in time. The story starts with Rayona, a mature 15 year old girl who seems to be trying to raise her irresponsible mother. Christine, Rayona's mother, speaks next, and the reader learns of her struggles growing up rebelling against her unaffectionate mother. Finally, Ida, the grandmother is allowed to defend her self, and tell of the secrets and betrayals that shaped her life. After finishing the novel, I was seized with the urge to reread it (which I have), because each irrational action of the mother viewed by the younger generation, is later explained. And in the end, I was amazed by the masterful tapestry Michael Dorris has created, and I was deeply moved by the integrity and strength of all three women.I wrote my senior thesis on the unrealistic depictions of Native Americans in popular media, and I was floored by the realism and the matter of fact presentation of the lives of the three women here."
2,I think this book was overdramatized.,I had to read this book for my english class and i hated it. It was incredibly boring. It did not have any relavent content in the first 100 pages and everything else after that was just extremely unrealistic.
2,None too fun...,"Apparently, I'm not the only person who was forced to read this for an English class. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't all that great, either. It would have been much better if it had ended after the second section--you had a decent enough sense of closure there. But no, it has to go into this utterly irrelevant and pointless third part. Not a great read, I feel. Sorry, Mr. McD."
5,Wyatt Earp Expanded Edition...,I consider this movie to be the most accurate movie ever made about Wyatt Earp's Life. This was the only movie which I was able to recommend a few years ago to my Kid's School history Dept.Russel's Tombstone was great entertainment and had a lot of factual props and clothing but Costner really nailed the history with his movie.I am looking forward to the Wyatt Earp DVD and will be ordering it in the near future. I hope that the DVD will have additional scenes and especialy will include more of the Ringo Character which seemed strangely absent from the original release.I have installed a link on my Tombstone History Discussion Forum: http://disc.server.com/Indices/39627.html to the Amazon ordering page and would encourage all to order this historic DVD.
4,"""One picture is NOT worth 1,000 words."" Costner","Considering al the variations on the Wyatt Earp ledgend that Hollywood has pushed on us, this is at least an attempt to tell the man's story minus the crap. Compared to ""Tombstone"" which relies on traditional Western habituals like guys beating eachother up for no reason, this movie is pretty tame. But, after all, Wyatt Earp was just a man caught in his time who died in Los Angeles, with William S. Hart as a pawl bearer. Watch it for the story."
5,Wyatt Earp,"DVD plays beautifully. Only problem I had with it is that there is nothing written on the DVD itself, except for very small print around the outside of the hole in the middle of the DVD."
3,A Bit Disappointed,I had hoped that the characterization of Wyatt Earp would unfold from its promise of a complex character. The pacing and length prevented me from showing it in one of my classes. Wyatt Earp kept me out of that Field of Dreams.
3,"Not sure if this film exists in HD DVD, but some sell it as such","While I like the film (that is why I purchased it), what I was sold was an HD DVD. I was sent a regular DVD by ExpressMedia."
3,Good not great,"This movie is not the best, but is an accurate and interesting depiction of Wyatt Earp. If you are fan of his like me, I think you would enjoy this movie."
5,"Wyatt Earp, Part I and Part II","I bought both ""Tombstone"" and ""Wyatt Earp"", they both have something to add to to this epic story base on real people and historic events of American history in the time of the old west. This kind of movie gives me insight and great respect for those who were brave enough to face the adversities and misfortune of an untamed frontier riddled with lawlessness. Through all that life could deal out Wyatt Earp managed to find himself with respect and honor and being truly blessed in the end, wins the hearts of many. I highly respect and would have been honored to know the man. This story was long over due to be made with modern film techniques that really bring the story to life while still making one wonder.... What Really Happened?"
2,Way too long.....,"Not realistic.....Wyatt Earp dunking Doc's head in the water? Don't think so! And a lot of it boring. Wyatt Earp was no saint I'm sure, but his character was so obnoxious at times I was almost rooting for his enemies! Enough said. Bad western...bad movie."
1,Thank God for Fast Forward,"This had to be the longest, dullest movie I have ever watched. Though to be honest I did fast forward through a great deal of it because it was so incredibly boring. Way too much Kevin Costner! Dennis Quaid was okay as Doc Holliday, though Val Kilmer was much more fun and interesting in Tombstone. Lewis Smith as Curly Bill definately could have been developed more. He's a gorgeous guy and should have been in more scenes and given a few lines to speak. His character was spoken about amongst the leading characters quite a bit leading the viewer to think he was 'important' though his character never developed in this rendition of the story. In Tombstone, Curly Bill was definately a major character and I just wish Wyatt Earp had done the same instead of making the viewer wonder what all the talk was about."
3,EARP LEGEND DECONSRUCTED,"There's a lot to like in Lawrence Kasdan's deconstruction of desperate western heroes in the epic WYATT EARP Two-Disc Special Edition (Warner).This admirable, sometimes pretentious attempt to capture the complex, multi-faceted character of lawman and criminal Wyatt Earp (an uneven Kevin Costner) from Wichita to Dodge to the showdown at Tombstone's O.K. Corral does not always work but it sure looks great. Dennis Quaid is memorable as Earp's lethal pal Doc Holliday.This is the 190 minute version. The twenty two additional minutes that are in the extended VHS version are presented separately here as ""lifted scenes."""
5,Great Movie,This is a great movie - two discs long. Great experience with this one - buying from Amazon.com.
4,Modern combat as viewed from the division command level,"Rick Atkinson was assigned as an embedded reporter with the command element of the 101st airborne division for the 2003 Iraqi war. He spent most of his time with the division commander, general Patraeus and his staff. This is not a chronicle of heavy combat, but an interesting look at what it takes to deploy, supply, and direct a division into combat. There were many problems to be overcome. Sand wrecked equipment, sometimes food and water were in short supply, and the Iraqi soldiers continually changed their methods of attack forcing the US forces to adjust their tactics. The command also had to take advantage of opportunities as they were presented, but be cautious due to the nature of the 101st; light infantry without heavy weapons or armor. Though not on a par with ""An Army at Dawn"", it is an insightful look at the responsibilities and decision making processes at the top."
4,Great For Drives To Work,"After reading a glowing review of the full book in the NY Times, I sent this CD to my son, a naval officer on active duty. He's well read on defense and security issues. He told me that he thoroughly enjoyed listening to this going to and from work. He told me that the author is the reader on the CD and does a fine job. The chronological narrative permits one to start and stop without losing much in comprehension."
2,"Decent, but flawed","Mr. Atkinson is a gifted writer and this is a very readable book. As a military professional, I appreciated his conspicuous respect for the soldiers, officers and enlisted alike, with whom he lived and travelled. Embedding with the 101st Division HQ allowed unique access to the Division's General Officers, which yields an interesting perspective on their leadership styles and concerns sometimes at the expense of what might have been a more comprehensive account. I would give this particular effort 2.5 stars with the main downside being the author's clear and present disdain for the national command authority's decision to go to war in Iraq. I do not argue that the decisions made should not be scrutinized closely, but Mr. Atkinson addresses them only with matter of fact (and mostly contemptuous) comments. I enjoyed his writing enough to find An Army At Dawn in the library and am glad I did."
2,Disappointed,"After reading ""The March Up"" and ""Boots on the Ground"" I found Rick Atkinson's, ""In the Company of Soldiers"" a profound disappointment. Though it is well written, it lingers with a dull spark of high expectations. It is further dampened by Mr. Atkinson's petty observations about President George Bush. If readers desire a solid story, I am inclined to direct you to ""Blinded by the Sunlight"" and ""A Fist in the Hornet's Nest."""
4,War,An excellent book. Rick Atkinson really knows how to research a subject. To read his books is like being there
3,Reasonably good read but Wash.Post biases peek out,"This book is reasonably well-written and describes the Iraq invasion from Division and Brigade command staff position exclusively. According to my 101st ABN son, who was there, it is factually accurate.It is thin on soldier's perspective.He just has to gratuitously insert typical Washington Post-reporter biases against the Bush administration. Where they are snuck in make no sense whatsoever in context but reflect that he apparently felt he had to do it to keep his credentials as a liberal reporter intact.He is advertised as a military historian.I've read John Keegan and he ain't no John Keegan."
1,"He's dead, Jim.","This game, as well as all City of Heroes games, should not be sold or purchased. NCSoft shut down the game and Paragon Studios that ran it on November 30, 2012. Amazon needs to pull all City of Heroes games from sale because it is a product that no longer works."
2,Broke on third use,"Let me be brief. I used this on the day I bought it for drilling twelve 5/8"" holes and it had great power. but three and a half weeks later as I used this for the third time to screw in four long screws, the trigger lock got depressed inadvertently and now it does not unlock. But the funny thing is, the unit does not stay on like you would expect of a trigger lock. Rather, when the variable speed trigger is depressed, it goes straight to high speed bypassing all the lower speeds. ARRG! I have to take this in to the factory repair shop now which is quite inconvenient and then I have to go pick it up in a week. Since I had this less than a month, you think B&D would just exchange it for a new one and fix this thing on their own time, but the service center rep that I talked to on the phone said they would not do that."
5,Great book,My daughter loved it.Would recommend it to anyone. Very satisfied with this purchase. very informative and easy to follow. Thanks
4,Not as good as the book,"Its a good movie, but not near as good as the book. I do not like it when storylines are changed. It was a good thing I read the book first because the movie leaves out a lot of background information."
4,Another Great Nicholas Sparks Story,"I loved this movie because the script was very similar to the book. I like the idea of writing the screenplay before the book is written. This story is filled with many emotions, a great story, and Miley Cyrus exceeded my expectations in her performance."
2,Not worth my time or money,"In one word, depressing. Okay okay. I liked the storyline overall, but it was just not my kind of movie. It was just way to sad and when I watch a movie I want to come away feeling good. Not like I want to go curl up in a blanket and cry. Although my friend I saw it with loved it. It's just my taste."
1,TOO. MIUCH.,"I always knew Miley Cyrus was cold-hearted, but this movie lets us know she contains no emotion. Or a heart. Or a soul.Miley plays ""Ronnie"", a teenage girl who goes to live with her father, and everything becomes nauseating along the way. Miley can't even act her way out of a paper bag more than she can sing, and don't get me started on ""When I Look At You"". That had to be Auto-tuned in order to manage her scattered vocals and long notes.The movie takes the romance from the Nicholas Sparks novel and pairs her up with Liam Hemsworth. Every girl who might have been head over heels with him might have lost their interest now thanks to this movie. The way she and Liam kiss each other caused me to lose my lunch.And then, spoiler alert, the father is dying. So is Greg Kinnear's career."
3,Marginally Okay,"Well, I had high expectations because I loved the novel. The development of the characters was weak in many areas. The pastor plays a major role in the novel and is given very little credibility in the movie. The father's and brother's characters were well done, all things considered. I think they should have chosen someone else besides Miley Cyrus for the main character role. I just don't think she is silver screen material."
3,Go away Hannah Montana!,"This would have been an amazing movie that me and my pals enjoyed to the extreme except for 2 reasons! The reasons are that it had way too many close ups of Miley Cyrus's dentist's nightmare and the fact that it was just a tad depressing! Most of us do not love Miley Cyrus and her behavior so me and my pals felt that she hurt a good concept! My other point is that no one wants to leave a movie theater feeling as sad as we did! So if you want to be annoyed by Miley and bawl your head off for 2 hours then go ahead and buy this. If not, read the book! Ive heard it was pretty good!"
2,Disappointment,"I was so excited to see this movie because the book was awesome! I quickly found the movie boring, and I wanted to turn it off. It barely followed the book, and skipped a lot of good plot lines. I was quite upset about the whole thing, and really wish I wouldn't have bought the movie in the first place. It was a waist of money. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend the book, because it was better. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the male actors in the movie. Miley Cyrus was not good at all... and I was a Hannah Montana fan, but the movie was so bad...definitely not even as close to being as good as The Notebook."
5,loved it!!!,i loved the book!!!! even though i love the movie i think the book is even better. either way both are very good
3,Greg Kinnear,"I actually bought this movie because of Greg Kinnear.I wanted to see him mellow and more real and this movie does that.It's a beautiful, thought provoking and very Nicolas Sparks. He really likes stories with heart."
3,Not sure,"I really enjoyed the movie, but was not satisfied with the service I received. It came in a cd case and it didn't say that on the details."
4,Sursplingly good,At first I didn't won't to see Miley Cyrus in some teenage romance story. But it happen to be good. And I enjoyed it. What is sad is she is going down Lindsay Lohan path which is very disturbing. But all in all the movie was really good and it was sad that her dad dies in the movie. Buy it or rent or check it out at your local library. I just hope she remember what it is like to be a good star and don't had down the path of corruption.(that's another story.) But a must see film.
4,Good old musical,"This is not in the same class as Singing in the Rain or 7 Brides but it is a solid musical from another era. Lots of great songs, singing and dancing with a story that doesn't get in the way of the music."
3,Not all there,"My kids thought it was a riot, but any fan of the original musical can't help but being shocked and disappointed that so many of the original Bernstein numbers were cut or substituted with pallid Hollywood fare. Great cast, good fun, but it could have been soooo much better."
3,It needed a bit more,"This is a very entertaining film, great views of New York in '49, even a Walgreens on a corner. The colors are vibrant and it's great to watch such talent perform. So why 3 out of 5? The DVD should have had more. Widescreen would have been nice. Maybe an interview from the archives (Sinatra, Garrett, Vera-Ellen or Kelly must have said something about this film in a TV interview). Even a film historian could have added some depth to the work. Films like this won't be seen again so why release the movie with a special features list that barely covers the talent involved? I suppose, as with West Side Story, there will be another release with more background. A special release version. Fun movie."
5,on the town,I got these movies for my Mom and she loves them she is 79 years old and doesnt get out much so all she has is movies she likes i get them when i have some extra money not often enough shewatches them over and over so thank you for low prices
5,One of the Best!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a really great movie. I think this movie is better than An American in Paris. The movie is about three sailors named Gabey (Gene Kelly), Chip (Frank Sinatra), and Ozzie (Jules Munshin) let loose on a 24 hour leave. On a subway Gabey sees a poster of ""Miss Turnstiles of the Month"" named Ivy Smith (Vera-Ellen) (he thinks she is some high society girl) so they spend the day looking for her. On the way they run into a cab driver who has eyes for Chip named Hilde (Betty Garrett). They also meet a gorgeous anthropologist named Claire (Ann Miller). Anyway this movie is awesome! It has a lot of great music and Ann dances great during the song ""Prehistoric Man."" There are also some great shots of New York. They really don't make movies like this anymore which is a dirty rotten shame! This movie is a must see!"
3,"Not bad, but not for me","This is an unusual and cleverly conceived children's book that strings together a series of tales and legends from English history. Unfortunately, I doubt modern kids would find the traditional stories engaging, despite the charming premise of an ancient and magical creature bringing them to life for a group of children. As an adult, I found it too light to keep my attention."
3,heartbeat misses a beat,i have been a ds fan for many many and have all her books i have to say this book is a miss not to say it wasnt a good story it was but there was way way to much of a pity party with the main chairtier itdidnt set well with me having such weak female lead just missed
2,storyteller,"I have read most of the Danielle Steel books. Some great and some not so. This one had me wondering why Adrian was so secretive. She did keep her baby against all odds on her part, but loses her husband because of it. In the end she finds a wonderful guy, Bill, in the supermarket, at first a friend, a man divorced from his dancer wife, with kids of his own. They discover that they have many values in common and over time become closer and closer."
2,Same old Same old,"Well, this game is fun for the first 2 minutes of play. The single player is just that, single player. You will get tired of it quick. The multiplayer is where this game couldbe great but they gave us just DM. Well any of you that play FPS gaes online alot know that just DM wont cut it. The programmers where to lazy or in to much of a hurry to work on more MP game modes and decided that eventually some mod makers would do all the work for them. Whatever they did, they shortchanged the buyers of this game. Enjoy."
5,Yes there is Peace and Quiet in Chicago,"A wonderful book, with great descriptions of places to go to avoid the rush and tensions of the city. I thought that other cities could also have books like this. In fact, I was going to write one for Prospect Heights and for Boston.Chicago's 50 Best Places to Find Peace and Quiet (City and Company)"
4,Principles and practice of structural equation modeling,Great book to use as a supplement to the LISREL 8 manuals. It's easy to read and provides references if you need to investigate a specific issue in more detail.
1,Disappointed - no captions,I bought this for Dead. Holstein to watch an it does not have closed captions so I am very disappointed. It was a waste of money!
2,Tell Warner Brothers to release the WHOLE film!,"The people who assembled this DVD should be ashamed of themselves - the whole film is not there!One of the most hilarious scenes in the original version of Magnum Force was when the crooked cops are chasing Harry around inside the (very dark) hull of a ship. Every time a shot was fired down there, there would be at LEAST six or seven loud, cartoon-like ricochets. The fact that this might really happen when all of the walls and ceiling are solid steel does not take away from its comic effect. Well, when they remastered the film for DVD, they took all of the ricochets out!They also cut out some of the sting operation where three hoodlums hold up a convenience store."
3,"Dirty Harry Callahan (II), with best Direction and storyline in all the Dirty Harry films! Adele Yoshioka is hot!","Dirty Harry is back and a strange thingis happening! Crime is going wwaaayyydown as vigilante cops (David Soul, KipNiven and John-Boy are killing criminalsoff on orders of nutty (and vulgar!)HalHolbrook. Poor Felton Perry! The latestDirty Harry partner to get cacked.

He hada different one in first and third in-stallments!"
4,"The Queen, the Bear, and the Bumblebee","My infant son loves this book. The pages are vibrant with colour and the pictures are wonderful. The rhyming is at times forced, but overall, it is a wonderful book to play with voices and I think the message is quite clear. I look forward to reading this book over the years to my son."
1,NOT satisfied,"I bought this product that it would have good quality, but no. There is a lot of background noise, which probably means poor materials. Also the noise canceling is weak. I can still hear a lot of noise in the background. I should have shelled out for a more expensive one."
1,Simply do not cancel sound at all.,"I've owned various noise cancelling headphones, from expensive Bose Quiet Comfort to cheaper models. I've had $60 noise-cancelling headphones do a great job at cancelling noise. I know how noise-cancelling feels, I know what to expect.I bought these on my way to the airport as I had forgotten mine... I wasn't risking much for the price. They are comfortable, I like that they nicely feet around the ear. The sound quality is decent. The noise cancellation absent.In fact, activating noise cancellation will actually INCREASE noise by adding a white noise. In the airplane, I tried switching it on and off... all I could perceive was a shift in the frequency of the woosh, but the volume of the noise was lower when noise cancellation was turned off.I don't know by which stretch of the imagination these can be called noise-cancelling headphones. If you don't care about noise-cancellation, you can buy a higher quality regular model, if you do, by all means stay away."
1,Broken,I have had these headphones for less than a year and have had problems since a few weeks after purchase (right after the return period). They now only work every fifth try.
5,chimaira + slipknot = diecast,"these guys are incredible.. i bought a chimaira sweatshirt online and when i got it i was sent a diecast sticker so i checked them out... i like almost as much as i like chimaira the whole cd is great... if you like chimaira you must own this... and see them live if you get the chance.. i saw them with hatebreed and they sound sweet live... if you are unsure you want to get this cd download ""in the shadows"" and you will be won over"
1,Does not work with Windows Vista,I bought this AT-1655CS for my new Vista PC but couldn't make it work. I've called Sharp and they do not have any date/plan for a Windows Vista driver.
2,Difficult Company to Deal With,The product was fine. But it took 3 emails to Amazon and finally a phone call to get the shipping information straightened out with the vendor. Will not do that again.
5,Excellent buy!,"I am very impressed with this case! It fits my Sansa e260 perfectly, it is well constructed, it protects my mp3 very well, and it has the right openings in the right spots. For the price it would be hard to beat. Keep in mind if you buy, that it has a belt LOOP, not a clip."
2,"It all went down hill after ""Evita...""","Okay, the PICTURES are pretty...I was fortunate enough tohave purchased the soft-cover edition, thereforesaving my money that would go directly to ""Sir"" AndrewLloyd Webber's account (And by the way, when did HE becomea ""Sir."" All he does is write weepy musicals...do yourememeber ""Aspects of Love?""... neither do I, honey!)"
5,Brilliant!!,"Really good product, absolutely to buy if you really want to understand how your Mac Os X works...interesting for everyone which like Unix-like systems!!Be careful with the edition since I bought this one valid for mac os x 10.2 instead of the new one, good for version 10.4!"
1,Why???????,"While other girls in high school were paperwalling their wall with Duran Duran, I was using A Flock of Seagulls. They were my favorite band. Love the first album, love the second album and love the third album.This CD is their 4th album. At the time I couldn't wait for the album to be released. I rushed to the store and bought it and excitedly listened to it. After that I sold the album to never check out any of their new music. It was a real disappointment. You still couldn't pay me to listen to it. The only song I like is ""Whole lot of loving"" and may be the only reason I will ever consider buying the CD -- used. I wouldn't pay full price for it.A friend said she saw some interview with them about how much the better the music is without Paul Reynolds playing the guitar. If that is true, then the band is definitely wrong. I am sorry, I cannot recommend this album to anyone."
3,Why in a rush?,"I've read Virgin's Triangle, and somehow i can relate to what Giselle feels, though I am much youger, i know what young people feel and go through when it comes to sex, I've lived in Trinidad and know all about carnival and those other matters, but i still ask myself why in a rush for sex? Otherwise i found these book very descriptive of it's environment, place, and theme, and i think the author Kevin is going on the rigth track to becoming a great writer, and hope to read another interesting book from him, but what i like the most is the change, since most caribbean stories tell the story of a little girl or boy growing up in a small village, and Kevin's story goes a step further into actually portraying what changes and feelings young people encounter not only in Trinidad but all around the world."
4,dance dance dance,"Follow the Leader is a popular song in the Mexican Riviera. At the hotels, the cabana boys get on tables and teach everyone to do the dance. It is the same idea as the macarena, but for the most part the movements are called out in the song. It had hundreds of adults up, laughing and cheering for more at a workshop I attended."
2,Not enough extras,"First let me say that I love Stargate Atlantis. I wouldn't hesitate to buy a season as it is released. But I am disappointed in this pilot DVD. I expected much more in the way of Special Features. After having purchased it, I now wish I had waited for the entire season to be released. There's not a whole lot going on in the way of special featues, except for a short preview of season 2, which isn't much at all and a preview of the video game. I think it was kind of lame for then to release this premiere like this. I'll definitely continue to watch the series but I won't be suckered in to buying the show piece meal any more."
2,2 and 1/2 stars,"I did not connect with this film for the following reasons:1. There was a lot of talk that seemed to bog down the pace. Granted, cultural and literary references were plentiful and cleverly integrated, but I too often found the dialogue tedious.2. Many of the plot situations were over the top and just not that funny to me---a tribal roasting interrupted by skin heads??? I felt these silly plot gags were at odds with the often deadpan pseudo(?) intellectual dialogue. The tone of the movie veered from one extreme to the other.3. There really was not much of a plot, which is ok with me if there is sufficient character development. But I didn't find much character development here either. Lots of characters, but what do we learn about any of them? Not much. I saw them more as ""type."" It was hard for me to care about watching any of them."
3,indie to the core,"An outrageously indie film that attempts to make death meaningful or to make a meaningful film. The movie is funny and sad and reflective at times, but on the whole, seems rather disjointed. Overall, it's a good overlook of the existential struggle that 20-somethings face about life, relationships, and living arrangements."
4,The Dash is a great bag!,"I am a fan of the Skip Hop bag. I ordered it b/c I loved the concept of it being a 'stroller bag' and it has not let me down. I love how it clips onto the stroller and its perfect for mall / shopping trips! The bag is a lot deeper than you might imagine and you can really stuff a lot of stuff into this bag. I can carry 3-8 ounce Dr. Browns bottles, along with a Deer Park water bottle, and ALL of my daughter's stuff for a daily outing(diapers, wipes, ointment, change of clothes, etc) in this bag with no problem. It also comes with a waterproof changing pad. Its really a great bag -- well made, sturdy, durable and still fashionable! The one I have is brown with a pink trim. I think I might also get the Expo bag that Skip Hop makes as well."
2,Skip Hop Dash-Canvas Olive review,"The bag is great! Lots of pockets are nice. However, Amazon failed to send me the portable changing pad that goes with the bag! This was big selling point for me to buy the bag, and they didn't even include it with the bag. I was disappointed with Amazon's performance."
5,One of the best 'rock' docs of all time!,"This documentary is fascinating on so many levels: the kitschy early 80's animatronic story, the biography of their creator (you MUST watch the extras for more of his story), and the interviews with the fans who still love Rock-Afire. It's a must-own because you can watch it again and again and again and still want more."
5,Great snack food,"I ordered the Vigo squid in ink as well as several of their canned octopus flavors, the price was so good that I wasn't expecting top shelf but thats what I got.They were all great tasting and well packed with meat, I'm about to reorder. The delivery was faster than I expected. I'm well pleased with my order."
5,Great shoe rack,I received the shoe stand about a week ago. Assembly was fairly simple. The rack is weighted and chromed and was very sturdy. Our porch was filled with an assortment of summer and winter shoes which included his and hers. After assembly I loaded the rack and the porch was quickly cleaned up and functional. I liked this rack so much I just ordered another. A quick turn of the trays make selection very easy. In my opinion this is a great buy.
4,a little wobbly,The item is stable but seems a little wobbly. The base is stable but the little individual metal parts that hold the shoes are slightly wobbly. I used it for women's size 7 shoes and it works. I put the shoes on in different positions and at different heights and it doesn't fall over and the racks turn easily.Overall I am happy with it. It takes up very little room and looks decent too.
1,18 pair revolving shoe tree.,Poorly designed. Will not hold 18 pair of men's shoes plus the revolving trees will slide down the pole because of the weight of the shoes.
4,your shoes are on carousel #3,"This is a great concept for the man or woman with more shoes than closet space.I live in a suit five to seven days a week, so my shoes are in one of three places at any one time: on my feet, at Kimmel Shoe Repair for shining (Indianapolis' killer shoe service), or in my closet. If it's their turn for the closet, they're on the 3-tier shoe tree.If you play your cards just right, you can spin the thing for easy access. It holds a lot of shoes.That's the good news.The bad news is you'd have to pay a whole lot more than this price for a revolving shoe tree that would (a) hold lots of shoes, (b) revolve for each access, and (c) not go wobbly on you from time to time.Yes, it goes wobbly. It's nothing you can't fix up with the enclosed wrench. But you do have to fix it up. That means dispossessing it of its shoes, which more or less defeats the purpose.It's a cool concept, good execution, mediocre performance."
1,not even 1 Mpixel product,"This is not a good quality product. Do not expect even fair pictures. After I bought it, pictures was not coming good. I thought ""it can't be camera, probably I am making some mistakes"". I tried everything for one week. No progress at all. Finally I invited one of my friend who has 2 Mpixel Minolta Camera. We set the tripod. We took same pictures with two different cameras. You should see the differences. His pictures far better than mine. (If anyone want to see them I can send via E-mail and all other pictures I took.)Battery life is another story. It does not hold any battery even Ni-MH.Costumer service is not satisfactory. They deliberately does not discuss the quality. All they talk is ""policy"". I wonder ""is there a policy about sending inferior product and labeling it 4 megapixel"".Now, I have to pay restocking fee. Instead of getting an apology, it cost me money and lots of time."
1,"battery killer, poor pics",If you like purchasing batteries then this is the camera for you. You cant even download all your pics onto the computer before the batteries die. The camera does not even come with a wall plug in so you have to spend more $$. I have had this camera since Christmas and I dont like using it because of the battery issues. Save your $$ on this product. The pics dont even look good the quality is worse then my old 2 Mega pixel camera
2,Georgette should stick with the Regency period,I have tried several times to read the other novels that Miss Heyer wrote outside of her Regency novels. I have not been able to get into either her other historical periods or her mysteries. They really lack the charm of the Regency novels.
2,Complaints,"I have traveled around the world. This travel guide leaves much to be desired. My largest complaints are: (1) it is much too large in size to be easily carried in pocket or purse, and (2) it doesn't even indicate Metra/CTA stations on the maps."
5,Will it be relased on DVD in the USA?,"I have been a fan of this show and I was hoping to get it on DVD here in the US but I see it is available on DVD in a region 2 format which will only play on DVD players in Europe. I was trying to find info on which company is issung the DVD (example : BBC, LTW ect.)to contact them but I have been unsuccessful as I would like to add this to my DVD library. If and when it is available in the US and you are into crime/action TV shows then get this you won't be disappointed but until then I just have to wait and see."
4,another solid performance,"No doubt, Paul Weller is the Mod-God and any fan must own this album, if only for the title track, The Bottle. At first it seems like it is being played at the wrong speed, but if you stick with it, it is one of Weller's best tunes. Track 2, is a nice tune, a bit unlike Weller's classics. Track 3 should have never made it onto the album. All-in-all, worth the price. Fans in the USA are eagerly awaiting the new release, Studio 150."
5,An Excellent Book!,"This was a very good book covering all white responces to the dragon in good amounts. One criticism of this book was made by a reveiwer who said that it should cover the Accelerated Dragon. But, that is a different opening (and, if you'd like to study that, there is a different 'Starting Out Book on it). The book gives very honest opinions; unlike other dragon books I've read, it isn't trying to convince the reader to play the dragon, and so won't hesitate to say a certain line of the dragon is bad. This book doesn't give huge detail, but it's a 'starting out' book, so it's certainly enough. I recommend this book!"
5,PJ! PJ! PJ!,"This is a fantastic record! It returns PJ back to her roots. The spartan sound works with these songs. I recommend this highly. If this was her debut, people will be frothing at the mouth about how good this record is!"
2,Her thinnest veil yet.,"Listeng to this album, you realize what a charade it all is. For someone so good at reaping havoc at her best (Dry; To Bring You My Love; Stories from the City, Stories frm the Sea), and at least being intriguing at her most murky (Is This Desire?), PJ Harvey (the band, but specifically Polly)sure does exhaust its vocabulary on this record. Despite a handful of really nice tracks (The Letter; Pocket Knife; Shame), the album really comes off as something streched and contrived at times, which is not a criticism I would have ever expected to be able to give her. Stories from the City... was slick and lyrically easy in some places, but the whole of the record was remarkably strong. This one actually feel like LESS than the sum of its parts to me though. I just don't buy into it like I usually do her music. And could someone please explain Cat on the Wall? Why, PJ?"
5,Uh Huh! This is good!,"From ""The Life and Death of Mr. Badmouth"" to ""Darker Days of You and Me"", this is PJ Harvey's most outstanding work. This work reminds me of Janis Joplin and Patti Smith mixed. The best song on the album is ""The Letter"", a unusually dancable song filled with strange sexual innuendo and the catchiest hook I've heard for a long time. If you like Joplin, Smith, Bjork, or other slightly offbeat music, definately check this out. Definately worth a try."
2,the demise of a truly great talent,"why is it that musical genius so rarely lasts? i could not agree more with the austin, tx review... pj harvey has lost it. check out ""bows & arrows,"" one of the b-sides to The Letter... it is one of the worst songs i have ever heard committed to CD! i have been fanatically devoted to pj harvey for the last several years, but now i fear it is time to move on, for good.p.s. only one thing i disagree with in austin, tx's review... you are being too generous in your assessment of why so many people rate this album so highly... i would say, it is for the same reason so many critics proclaimed Stories her masterpiece... because most music listeners out there are tasteless idiots!"
2,Not the PJ Harvey sound I fell in love with,"On the surface it seems like she's gone back to her early days of gritty raw sound, but the songs are just not up to par. ""Cat on the Wall"" and ""The Radio"" have got to be the worst songs on the album; annoying melodies/hooks- discordant with no resolution, no buildup/climax/suspense, it's like random whining. I have nothing against minimalism, but the riffs are uncreative. ""The Letter"" is not bad, ""Shame"" is catchy/melancholic, wished it could have been developed more. If you're new to PJ Harvey, get 'Rid of Me' and '4-Track Demos' instead."
1,A horribly shallow and pretentious record,"The entire of this album could be summed up in the sound of a once-talented rock and roll heiress laughing as she passes what amounts to four years' worth of bad demos and horribly-produced rubbish off on her faithful and blinded fans. A true mistake and cause for someone to be dropped from their label HARD. I can think of nothing more insulting to truly talented musicians trying to make it out there than to have something like this on a major, and to have its cover art disgraced by a logo THREATENING me not to COPY the thing (as if anyone else would want it) is beyond mind-numbingly hilarious. A true disaster in every way."
4,eh,not what i expected...sonny stitt stole the show. everyone else was mediocre at best.would i reccomend this .....probably not.thank you
4,Review of Stormbringer RPG Sourcebook,"I was very pleased with the condition of the item. Though it was a bit beat up around the edges on the outside, it was pristine within. All of the maps and images are intact. I'm a huge fan of Michael Moorcock and his anti-hero, the albino Emperor of Melnibone, Elric. I enjoy roleplaying and have done so in several different settings. Now I have a chance to take my friends and I on a voyage through Mr Moorcock's Young Kingdoms. It makes me incredibly happy."
5,A MUST GET!,Do you like pictures? Forever Spice has got it! Do you like reading? Forever Spice has got plenty of it! Do you love the Spice Girls? Need I ask more? This is a must get for any true Spice Girls fan!
1,"""support for S & M/torture--Bush would love it""","I like mysteries, etc. even those with some violence, but I found this highly disturbing: considering the issues of the day, itexploits torture, sexualizes it (oh so subtley) and leaves for theun-doubtedly unending sequels the ""punishment"" of the villain. Icannot help but feel total DISGUST for the writer who has somereal skill and accomplishments (does NOT need to do this). He does NOT help society look at the pros and cons of torture (?46%of us think ""some"" torture is OK!!!????) but encourages us to getsome kind of vicarious feeling from the long drawn-out descriptions--feels really ""sicko"" to me. As a volunteer in a library who does not believe in ""censorship,"" this is the oneexception I have run across. (We had choices of audio-tapes & Isimply could not recommend this one). With ratings of ""5"" I fearfor our future (along with everything else currently going on)."
1,Look elsewhere!,"Coming from France, I was used to using drying racks and wanted to purchase one for items that cannot go in the dryer -I was getting tired of decorating my house with hangers every time I did laundry.I didn't want to get a wood rack, but was unable to find a European style rack either, so I settled for this one. Well, this is proof that you should never settle.After just a few uses, the chrome finish has rubbed off from the tubes where they expand, resulting in rust stains on my clothing!I've finally found European style racks -read powder- or plastic-coated- available for purchase in the US. They do cost a lot more than this rack, but at least I won't have to buy a whole new wardrobe as a result of using them."
1,bubbles,I have purchased bubbles like this in the past and they were wonderful. I recommend purchasing them from the store if you can find them. I think these had been sitting around too long and they didn't work. They were a sticky mess and not one bubble was catchable. I spent a lot of money on one tube because I couldn't find them in the store and I ended up throwing it away. I would not recommend.
5,Awesome!,This has been a fun incentive for good behavior in my classes when I sub. They are eager for the end of the day if they have enough points to play and they usually do!
3,"bubbles, bubbles",This is a cute little gimmick which produces fun bubbles. Unfortunately my little one tired of it easily.
3,An Interesting CD,"This CD is quite interesting, I really like the remix of Bob Marley's Sun Is Shining, I Also think the Remix of Grace Jones' Pull Up To The Bumper is well done as well. However, The other remixes on here do not equal the intensity of the first 2 tracks. I enjoy Ring My Bell by Anita Wells but its all pretty much down hill from there. The other songs are average but they lack the ability to grab your attention like Sun Is Shining does. I do recomend this CD, It is a great departure from what we usually hear on the radio but It could be alot better."
2,Cover art & title are a little misleading,"This is a pretty good book, but not if you're expecting stories from the current era of NASCAR stars, for example, Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Most of the stories relate to the older stars, and that's fine, but considering the cover art and the lead in for the title, I expected a little more of the ""new"" and a lilttle less of the ""old"" stories."
1,Boring,"I forced myself to keep reading and made it to page 106. I had to put it down. The writing is all over the place and the characters are weak. I thought the story had potential, that's why I kept reading. It just never got better. I read alot and I normally don't put a book down but this one was unreadable in my opinion. Thankfully I bought it bargain priced!"
4,Fun historical fiction,My students really enjoyed reading the book while studying Ancient Greece. They had heard of the show/ books but had never read it.
1,DJ clue-less messing with good music.,"Nice selection of artists, how could you mess up a cd with all of these stars? Well, DJ clue must have solved the mystery on how to do just that. His obnoxious yelling is painfull for the ears. This is definiteley an album to leave on the shelves."
5,The soul has its rages,Dogs are the true observers walking up and down the world. May we be dogs for moments and lapse into small insights to languish ever so slightly and come back to tell of it as eloquently as Ferlinghetti!
4,Like them,"One of the pins is closed to tight for me to stick in my hair. But overall, good hair pins."
2,Tough little barettes,The metal holds tight. I think this would be better to hold a bun of hair rather then holding peice away from the face because they get stuck and rip the hair.
1,A wast of Money,This product is a wast of your money. Don't buy it. They won't even go into your hair!
3,Laanguage of Flowers,I didn't really enjoy the book. It was pretty joyless. I need a little positivity in a story. I'm sure some people enjoy the book however.
1,Flowers but No Piictures,"The Language of Flowers: A NovelI was highly disappointed when I received this book. It had no pictures of flowers and it was in order of flowers not a meaning. I wanted a book that showed the flower and then told what it meant, love, sincerity, passion, etc."
3,Not recommended for abandonment/divorce loss,"I feel the title of the book is misleading. Most of the book seems to concentrate on womens adolescent loss from fathers who have died, and not much on abandonment issues. Much of the book is the author's personal experience from her father's death. I would not recommend this book to women who have lost their father through abandonment/divorce. Yes, loss is loss, but there are different issues surrounding a father who leaves the family vs. the finality of death."
3,Disorganized presentation; hard to find specifics.,Have found other books that cover the information about broodmares and early foal care in a much more effective and organized manner. Found the information too oriented toward opinion and not based enough on documentable fact.
1,STOP RIGHT HERE!,"Take it from me (the Praga encyclopedia), buy the US version, there's more tracks. That being said, you could always help out someone who is contributing so much to the world of music and give him some extra cash. Just had to let ya know the US version has more tracks."
2,"A few ""A's"", and lots of ""F's"", almost make a ""C""","When this group rocks, they wail -- reference cuts #1, #2 and #13. Other than that, having listened to the CD several times, and been a popular music fan all my life, I'm not sure what I heard except a bunch of kids playing around with electronics. Many groups have experimented with new musical forms, themes, lyrics, and so on, over the years, sometimes with results that have a significant impact either immediately or over time. Far from being a trendsetter, this CD, in its better cuts, temporarily entertains, while overall, it costs much more than it is worth and resells at a very steep discount."
5,aptly named!,"I PROMISE that ANY fan of rock music will regret each and every day that they had to live without this album in their collection. These guys have defined the core of what rock is all about...these days, it's getting harder and harder to find a band that just wails away on their guitars as one big, monolithic unit that jams like there's no tomorrow. Instead they rely on overdubbing and recording pieces instead of the whole. God made Neil Fallon's vocal chords for the very purpose of fronting a band like Clutch...and I can vouch for their cohesiveness, having seen them live recently. If you ever get the chance, take it! I don't have much more to say, other than you won't regret buying this album, or for that matter their stompin' previous effort, The Elephant Riders. ROCK ON."
5,Classical Masterpiece,"This is one of the best plays I've ever read! I had seen the movie, of course, and knew what to expect, but somehow reading it was even better. Having a general idea of what was coming also made some of the smaller jokes more evident. Trust me, this is one you don't want to pass by!"
4,Good chance for reading it,I took the chance to read it because it was for free. Never read it before and I really enjoyed it!
5,Essential Wilde,"Funnier and more entertaining than you ever thought reading a play could be, and absolutely more relevant now than ever, The Importance of Being Earnest is Oscar Wilde at his best. Thankfully short ( you can read it in an hour or so ) and filled with brilliant, biting humor."
4,I thought it was a good book.,"I thought this was a good book. I read it with my 10th grade class. It had a few good models of comedy in it.I don't have much to say about it, but I must go write an essay on it now."
2,Quite amusing,"This play is quite amusing and it is not very difficult to read. I think it does not earn more stars because you already know at the beginning how this play probably will end. Sometimes I had to wonder about the stupidity of the personnages, I mean they act in such a stupid mannor. I do not like the end because the author did not think about a fitting end before writing the book and so I had the impression that he just invented the end. This play is quite amusing to fill up time, but it is not so good that I would read it twice."
2,Not so funny,"I have decided that since so many people are obviously blind to how dumb this play is, I should write a review to enlighten anyone that might read it. The humor is dated and because of that, very boring. The situations are completely inconceivable and it makes no sense! The characters are flat and serve no real purpose. I suggest that no one else ever ever read this play."
1,General Books Problem...Not the book,"I ordered this for my daughters birthday and Amazon delivered right on her birthday. My daughter is a huge Oscar Wilde fan! Unfortunately, the book was full of garbage text. It was printed by General Books the day I ordered it. I then requested a replacement. Once again, it was printed the day I made my request and it contained the exact garbage text that the original order contained. Here is an example of the garbage text that this book contained...(Jk*he$. HeL*) This was all throughout the book. Then half the book looked like some bizarre glossary that didn't even belong to this book. The entire book was worthless both times and I requested a refund. I can't give a proper review on the book as it was unreadable!"
3,"Quick, at times silly read","Wanted to read some Wilde and started here. I expected it to be funnier but was entertained enough the “Bunburying"" of Jack and Algernon as they would say (living a double life I suppose)."
4,Good primer for dog sitting,"This comprehensive book offers a lot of substance regarding the dog sitting business. By studying the content, I am able to consider possibilities that are more extensive than my limited thought process. I did find a need to gloss over non-computer-age references. It's a fundamental book."
2,too much of a business text,"This book is not what I expected. Too much emphasis is put on employees, i.e. hiring, training, motivating, even nutrition for your employees! Most of the books information could be found in a generic business text. I wanted a book that explaines what is it like to be a professional pet sitter, more real life experiences, good and bad. I'm still trying to decide whether this is the right occupation for me. This wasn't helpful."
3,Colorescience matte powder,It is a good sunscreen however amount does not come out too easily and amount is hard to control. If you have sensitive skin this product is not for you I tended to break out somewhat. It is pricey and DHC has a better loose powder sunscreen at a much better price.
5,Great with small children,I really like this product. I use it on my two year old to get into the places where normal sunscreen can't go. I use it on the top of her hair (she does not have very thick hair yet) and in her ears. I use it on myself also (mostly for the face)... It is convenient to throw in your bag so you always have sunscreen with you!!
5,well lets see,you see they say its by a bunch of whacked out acid dropping drug using hippiesbut if you look at the back of the book and see where the book credits are you would be surprisedall diff books cross referenced like that of the dark night of st john and other famous religious things
3,biased editor,"The editor belabors his viewpoint in his commentary, detracting from this reader's enjoyment of the poetry. His interpretations of each of the poems are narrow and very limiting."
1,"""NOT VERY INFORMATIVE ""","THIS BOOK DOES NOT EXPLAIN IN DETAIL ABOUT THE BALL PYTHON, I HAVE LEARNED MORE FROM THE INTERNET THAN I HAVE FROM THIS BOOK. IT DID NOT ANSWER ANY OF THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT I HAD AND I ENDED UP PURCHASING ANOTHER. ALTHOUGH IT WAS SLIGHTLY INFORMATIVE, NOT ENOUGH WAS SPECIFIED"
3,Hair powder leaves flat,"I was really excited to try this product that I have been hearing rave reviews over for a long time. I promptly recieved the product, and immediately tried it, only to find it difficult to use (it seemed to spurt in places like spray paint). I was however able to blend it in somewhat, but it just didn't seem to do the job like advertised."
1,Flimsy is the only word that comes to mind...,"I have been using Rotting pens made in germany for 15 years this was the worst one I ever held. Cheap quality for big bucks! The inner tip is bent and it SHREDS paper into cotton, the ink cartridge takes 2 minutes to get into to refill. Cleaning the 'heart' is almost impossible. And the ink is blotchy and GRAY! (possibly the one I ordered was old) but with poor quality penn it came as no big surprise to have bad ink to match.For a professional artist this was a total bust, for someone using this for 'handy pen' for notes, it might do.Just be wary of sellers, when buying this item. Mine did NOT communicate at all, and refused to give me refund even after the pen was returned. I had to file A-Z and pay return shipping. NOT WHAT I WOULD CALL SATISFYING PURCHASE IN ANY WAY...."
1,Optical Block problem,"I've had this Sony KF-60WE610 for about 5 years. The optical block failed after about 2 years and was replaced under warranty. But in early 2009 (just after Sony's extended warranty), the optical block failed again leaving blue pixel dots all over the screen along with a blue haze. No TV should fail after such a short period of time, and yet this problem has been experienced by thousands. I expected this TV to last for decades just like all my other TVs. And Sony refuses to back their product. I for one will NEVER purchase another SONY product."
1,Do NOT buy this model!,"I'm so disappointed in this TV!! We had a fantastic picture for 3 years, and then like so many others our optical block started to go. We got in touch with Sony and they agreed to pay for the part, we had to pay labor which worked out to be around 300 bucks. After that the picture was great again and now 3 years later, the block has started to go AGAIN!! We've had this TV a total of 6 years and have replaced the bulb twice at 200 bucks a pop and the optical block once and twice if we chose to do it again. We certainly are not. I can't tell you how miserable it is to pay for HD TV and watch all your favorite football games in total blue.Here's our lovely TV the first time it went out.[...]And it looks about the same this time only it's a square shape instead of a circle. I'll never, ever buy a sony TV again."
3,NOT SO SURE YET...,"I am giving this a 3 stars because the smells do not really feels natural, the way I see is like I have smelled this before, so nothing new, maybe for some people is good,but not for me. I still think is an ok cologne."
1,Contains cancer causing methylparaben,"Methylparaben, which is readily absorbed through the skin, has been found in large quantities in human breast cancer cells. In addition, when skin care creams containing methylparaben are exposed to UVB rays, cell death occurs and there is massive stress oxidation, which can cause disease and cancer. I wouldn't put it on my skin and, as a skin care professional, I say not worth it."
1,"Pucker up, these mussels taste sharp!",The sauce these mussels are in is awful. It is very ascerbic (tangy/bitter). I had to first run the mussels under water before they were palatable. I agree with the other reviewer: it is very hard to open the can even though its a pull top.
4,Clear and concise advice on bringing up your children,"Very clear writing and presentation. Part one is handled through simple, every day life type of questions with an answer that shows how the Montessori method applies. Part two and three cover the needs of your children and how can you help them; both are also very focused. An easy book to read, very enjoyable, that will not take more than a couple of hours to finish; however you will find re-reading parts of it as time goes by. An excellent companion to parents of young kids (2 to 6 years)"
5,September 11th and the return of Christ,This book reads smoothly. It discusses a very interesting points of the future events as explained in the Bible and Islam. It gives a different view of Jews and Israel. It explain very well the Christian-Zionest movement and how it is seting the stage for the Antichrist. It talks about the correption of Jews in Israel and how this will triger the wrath of God on them. Finaly it describes the Big Battle (Armageddon) that will take place between Muslims and the West.
2,trash Disc1; keep Disc2,"Had this been a 1CD[disc2] release, it would've gotten 3 stars. As such, I have to rate it as a whole 2CD compilation - 2 stars. Disc1 lives happily in the garbage dump; while disc2 I ripped, deleted 1/2 tracks, then gave it away.Stand out tracks are by Alvaro Pierri #8 and #9. The rest is either solo classical guitar, or mixed with annoying percussion."
3,Fascination with the Spanish Guitar,"I have never reviewed an album before. And I was fascinated with the Spanish Guitar. Everyone in our household seems to enjoy listening to this CD. We had to play it a number of times...and then it began to ""grow"" on you."
1,ITEM WAS DELIVERED AS PROMISED However the unit itself failed later,"My item was delivered as promised, on time and undamaged. I experienced no issues at all with the ordering or shipping process.The unit itself burned out after a few months of use. I never cranked the radio or listened to it at an uncomfortable level. I smelled something burning and then the speaker stopped working. This was the 2nd LA360 I had. The first one burned up after 4 months."
1,didn't work,ordered this for my mom and we put it on a couple of rugs and it sucks. we were at walmart a week later buying a different product.
5,It sticks,"Product really works. I have a super thin lightweight rug in the dining room and this product holds it in place. Before it slid around everywhere, now it hasn't moved an inch since i got this."
3,Helpful,"This is a great product for area rugs over wood, but found it useless for rugs on carpet. I had tried another basic brand at a large well know store but couldn't get the backing off. Had to toss it. The backing on this product came off easily."
4,"Please Give the little guy a break,he's worth it,trust me","Undermine is,like all of the ""Jungle planet"" Decepticons,a lizard.the other jungle planet decepticons are Scourge,Brimstone,and Wreckloose.Now undermine is a very sturdy little dinosaur.he may not have the best poseability,but he is loads of fun to play with.His robot mode head resembles a knights helmet from the middle ages.in dinosaur mode,he transforms into a nasty (in a good way) little green Spinosaur.His ""cyber key gimmick"" is actually very nice,you insert the key into his back fin,and a big grey,nicely detailed blade slides out of the fin.this little guy is a very nice figure,worth the money,and i highly reccommend him to any transformers fan"
4,Book about myself,"Very pleased. One corner of the cover was a little crushed, but that could have happened in the mail. Can't wait to start writing in it. Book"
4,Good little book.,Very nice. Simple questions for grandparents to write about their memories. Pages aren't too big. It was good for the purpose that I needed.
3,Its size is a problem,"I bought this book for my grandmother after carefully reviewing several other autobiographical writing aides. I have to admit I was disappointed when I received the book. The questions are good, but the book itself is very small. If I'd noticed the dimensions of the book that are listed near its photo, I might not have purchased it. Each of the 201 questions gets one side of one page for answering, and the pages are roughly 5x8"". It is almost impossible to imagine that the kind of rich, detail-laden anecdotes we hope for (and that we want to pass on for generations) when we give this as a gift could fit in the space provided. Though not ideal, I ended up buying a small notebook for my grandmother, along with the book, that she can continue her answers in."
4,A great workbook for self-discovery and family history,"This book asks excellent questions relating to several different periods of a person's life. Most of them are generic enough that they can be commented on, providing insight to whomever ends up reading the final version. This is not a book which can be completed quickly - many of the questions relate to ""middle age"" with grandkids, etc. (things I have yet to experience). However I believe once it is done (even in partial form) it will be something nice I can leave behind for my children and maybe grandchildren to read and gain insight into my life."
5,WOW,"That's all I can say... Wow. I received this CD for Christmas, and I honestly, very sad to say!, didn't open it for about 3 weeks because I went back and forth about whether or not I should return it to get something different! Oh, my goodness! I'm just so incredibly thankful that I didn't! This has to be one of the best CD's that I have in my collection. It's filled with passion and true talent. I wouldn't be surprised if Michael W. Smith is like the next John Williams or Patrick Doyle. His work is absoutely incredible. This could totally be the soundtrack to the ""Patriot""! People actually ask me if it is! Do buy this CD."
5,Beautiful,"Just when you thought that the ever-successful Michael W. Smith couldn't get any better, he stuns you with yet another curve in his musical success. I didn't know how this album would be so I decided to try it simply because I love soundtracks and I had heard that this is supposed to resemble that kinda feel. I was shocked at how wonderful this thing is. It is woven beautifully into a masterpiece of ballads which include instruments ranging from violins to cellos and pianos to bagpipes. It has everything a movie score would. I think he should consider writing for movies because if this is what his debut album sounds like I can't wait for the follow-ups. Go buy it now!"
5,Brief Cognitive Hypnosis,"This book needs to be utilized by every therapist who has trained in both modalities. Knowing how to blend these two therapies can make an important difference when dealing with traumatic events, or dealing with chronic addictions, or both. I highly recommend Brief Cognitive Hypnosis, as another powerful tool in the therapists' tool box."
2,there are better,"I was expecting more old school hip hop when i got this CD. Instead you get alot of electronic boogie, which honestly is not that great for breaking too. There are no well known tracks like Run DMC's its like that, Afrika Bambaataa's Planet Rock, Wildchild's Renegade master, or any Rock steady crew songs. I personally like to break to Bomfunk MC's, or Freestylers and so would recommend those titles over this one. Nevertheless, some of the songs are quite good but the album as a whole is just not worth it. The songs are so similar and many are just remixes. Any aspiring Bboy should not get this CD."
4,No SPX effects here....thank God.,"A cinematically beautiful film. A mosaic of sympathetic characters, raw emotions and the roads they all intersect on. A deeply emotional tale of regret, rejection, liberation and ultimately finding forgiveness and rediscovering that one true love. A film that will be as relevant in 10 years as it is today."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.,"I could only view the beginning of this film because it consistently froze up on me. I didn't like it at all. I felt that the writing was bad, some of the acting unbelievable. I usually don't like to give very negative reviews, but I feel that I wasted my money on this. Perhaps if I could've seen the whole film, the rest of it would've been better & I would be able to give it a higher rating."
3,Something besides what looks like the authors review.,"This would be a good book if you're buying a vette,to determine it's originality,but a restoration guide it is not."
3,Some exellent tips presented,"This book for the most part does what it claims to. It helps the reader design better. The focus is on signs although I found it useful for business cards, posters, anything that involves type. I found it useful in that the author breaks things down...for instance you must decide what is the most important part of sign and that should be read first, but you simply can't just put giant capital letters for this purpose. Naturally the author explains why that is not very effective with some decent visual aides. The book focuses mainly on type only and it is all in black in white. He does try to talk about color but it seems kind of silly as you are studying designs in grayscale!"
2,Dated. Not what I was expecting,"I was looking for more in terms of layout that are FRESH...new and modern style brochures and website design wheras this was more of lettering and signage from the 80s. This book is black and white and although the author is great at manual lettering, I work with digital graphics and fonts. I commend the author's caligraphy skills, but if you are looking for something more along the lines of digital art/print art layouts, this is may not be the book for you, and definitely not for $25. Maybe $10. If you are looking for new and fresh, I recommend Layout Workbook by Kristin Cullen."
4,"Good, but...","Good but lacks a little something. A little something called grit. It's there in 4-5 of the tracks, but the rest don't cut it. Best tracks are 'Butterfinger', 'Attica', 'Changes' and 'Purdie Good'. Some cool electric piano playing on these, and there are about 2 more tunes that you can like, the rest are cheesy fillers. Get Rusty Bryant's or Johnny Hammond's 'Legends...', they're much more satisfying, and come back for this later."
4,Great compilation,"Archie Shepp was always one of the more accesible of the 60's ""new wave"" jazz saxophonists. This CD gives a nice overview from his excellent ""Impulse"" period. It would have been nice to trade a cut from Four for Trane for one of the Fire music cuts. Still that is a very minor criticism. Both New Thing at Newport selections are included, which is nice. The three cover versions on here are his best - especially his bizarre take in The Girl from Ipanima. A great way to discover this unique sax legend."
5,Great Christmas Present,"I ordered this through Amazon for my son for Christmas,and he was totally delighted! The CD arrived just a few days after I ordered it, in plenty of time for Christmas. Thank you!"
5,Unique Christmas music,"My son-in-law is a not a big fan of Christmas music, however he does love Jethro Tull as do I. We ordered this for him and he really really likes it. It is very good, with a good mix of music."
3,Solid not great,"A slightly different Christmas fare to the usual carols -which if you are like me drive you crazy after some hours.I wont repeat the track listing - the first couple of tracks I was surprised by - they were good, engaging but also capable of being background music (not something that I would ever have though Jethro Tull could do). A solid generally well arranged album although I find I loose interest in the middle (Last man at the party?) before reengaging for the remainder.In short a good buy for tull afficionados and recommended for anyone after something a little different for the festive season. You won't upset your grandparents with this:-)"
5,Good Read,I received this book as a Christmas gift. The first Nora Roberts book that I've read. Before reading this book I was mostly into Mystery thrillers. Now I'm definatly reading some romance novels. I really enjoyed this book and am now reading more from Nora Roberts.
4,What an ending or is it for the Quinns?,"Seth IS finally home.....I read that a one or two people thought the book focused too much on the Quinn family and not enough on Seth and Dru. I could not disagree more. As always, Nora tied up all the loose ends and gave the reader a chance to visualize what the Quinn family was like today. Then she spent most of the story doing what romance novels do and that is keeping the reader gripped wondering if the two main characters will work through the tragedy and live happily ever after.I also read that some thought her use of profanity was too much and not needed. Again, I disagree. The reader needs to put personal views aside and look at the characters. Nora lives in Maryland and by my guess has spent time in small rural watertowns eating crabs and listening to the locals. So, I would guess that she has a pretty good understanding of how to create ""real life"" characters. I hope the story continues...."
4,Good - but not her best,"Seth is, naturally, a compelling subject, and one that Nora's fans have waited for with major anticipation. The book, like all of Nora's work, is good. The characters are good, the prose interesting, the interactions believable.I liked the book for a number of reasons (not the least of which is revisiting other characters), and I really liked the characterization here. Unfortunately, I found the plot to be a bit...um... canned? Usually a Nora Roberts book grabs me and won't let go - this one was much less compelling in the plot, particularly (it lacked the usual tension that characterizes her books).Still, a very good read."
2,For the novice,"Great if you are a starter in military recruiting programs. Some of this information you will hear when you are at school. The rest you will see/learn as you go, but it's nice to have it all to digest up front. As stated it really does not bring the skills beyond basics. If you want that go to the sales management people. Ziegler, Covey, Magee and the gang."
3,Historical Document,"The audio quality is hideous but it's all we have. Historically this is such a significant recording that one must set aside the technical flaws and just appreciate how important this concert was. I believe Duke learned alot from the performances and came out of it a bit wiser, but perhaps jaded. Im sure it affected his approach to the ""business"" of music. Thankfully, in the end, Ellington proved them all wrong."
4,"A Quick, Powerful Work","This is an easy read, but one that will stay with a reader long after the final page. What struck me upon finishing it is how it really forces one to examine identity in fiction. For instance, the work throughout largely explores how Martin Guerre's wife struggles to identify (and identify with) her husband. She is clearly drawn to be the center of the story. However, towards the end of the book, there is a shift and one realizes that, while she may be the center, she also has to react to others and their equally important decisions about self."
2,"Same first name, very different voices","This CD, which is a different artist singing the anthem written for Charlotte Church, the now 15 year old singing sensation from Wales, is very poor. Not only is the recording itself very poorly done, but the artist should have saved herself the embarrassment of trying to imitate Ms. Church. Ms. Russe clearly does not have the vocal tone, quality, or pitch of Ms. Church and therefore should not have recorded this CD. Better luck next time, Ms. Russe."
3,show bom,"um cantor com muitos sucessos uma boa voz com grande companhia, blu-ray chegou em bom estado, músicas que ficaram marcadas por muito tempo"
5,Think History is Back? Think Again!,"The September 11 attacks only vindicate Fukuyama's claim thathistory as he treats it - the history of development of ideas - has come to an end. Terrorists have no ideas, have no vision, it cannot be supplemented by hatred and destruction. Although...Is it ideas that shape history or something else???"
4,"The new world view - not true, but, intelligent","The book is written by a very intelligent man, and presents the idea that Liberal Democracy is the peak of human social development. 1st of all, democracy, ...and even representative democracy is impossible to achieve, given human greed and pride. The autor addresses this, but fails to acknowledge that the super-greedy are practicing a new kind of imperialism where the world is conquered through ownership. Vestigial democracy is very valuable to the super greedy, as it gives them ""legal"" claim to aquisition far beyond their needs, even to the point of crushing the vast majority of the world's population into a functional slavery. Author argues that, regardless of flaws and weaknesses, liberal democracy is the best we can do. Maybe that is true. Frightening book -- feels heavily agenda'd. Definitely a valuable read."
3,A flawed work,I read this book because it was so prominent in The Icarus Syndrome and because many of my friends were so impressed by it when they first read it. This is one of the most important tomes of the neo conservative movement. It should be noted that Fukuyama has looked back this work as flawed. He believes that Iraq was a huge mistake from which our country might very possibly not recover.
2,usb connection,"Unit was dead on arrival. I could see the drive about could not access, format, or initialize the drive. If it had worked I am sure it would have been fine."
4,Gets the job done for those on a budget,"I had a hard drive that was failing so I removed it from my PC. I wanted to pull some pictures and documents from it without re-installing it. This kit is perfect for that. If you wanted to set it up for a longer more permanent storage option you would need to invest in a hard drive enclosure. If you've ran out of internal connections or if you just want to quickly access a hard drive, this kit fits the bill."
4,I had better when i worked in IT,"This isn't the best one I've owned but it's simple and it did the job. It ran an old 4700 RPM ATA laptop hard drive straight from USB.The first time I plugged in the USB then plugged in the HD... that was bad. Don't do that.1. Plug in the drive to the converter, make sure it's snug and on a flat surface where it won't get damaged.2. Plug in the USB, preferably to a USB plug on the back of the computer (if accessible) because they're just more stable.3. Wait a while for the drive to spin up (if applicable) and you're golden.It comes with a bunch of cables that can be useful for system builders ... or drives that need the juice (as it was intended). Good luck."
1,did not work for me,did not work for me ... plugged it in and win xp said unknown device .i plugged it in to all available usb ports but still unknown usb device. :(
4,Does what I needed,"As far as the functionality, this does exactly what I needed, which is to be able to extract data off a raw drive or put it on. I use it to upgrade the drive of a Tivo or just pull off computer data. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the power supply could be better integrated with the interface. Overall, a handy thing to own for any geek."
4,Works great!,"I purchased this product after my laptop hard drive crashed. I was able to hook it up to the old SATA drive and recover my data!The only thing I can say negatively about this product is that is has way too many wires, and the instructions leave a bit to be desired."
1,Fried my drive,"Used this as part of an upgrade process. Fried my drive, drive board sparked then smoked. Thankfully, I had a second backup of my data."
1,!!! Hard Drive Fried !!!,Step 1: Plug into a SATA hard drive.Step 2: See smoke coming from the hard drive.Step 3: Throw product and hard drive into the trash.
1,BUYERS BEWARE,Everything appeared to be in order until I opened the package to find the cable that goes from the USB adapter to the actual hard drive was missing. Not very useful as a paperweight. Do no buy from this seller.
1,Will Fry You Sata Drive,"If you want your SATA drive Fried than this is your Tool. I have been in the computer business for 27 years so its not like i do not know what i am doing. as soon as i plugged the power adapter in to my sata drive and plugged it up there was nothing but smoke pouring out of the drive. and yes you guessed it, the drives is toast now and will not work at all.The IDE connection works fine. have not checked the Laptop connection and will not since i will be returning it today. i don't want anything sitting around that will fry devices."
2,It only work for my sata cdrom and not working for all my ide drive,"I expected it to work on IDE and SATA, however it only works on mySATA CDROM. I tried on my old IDE drives, it all not working.I tried different jumper setting on the drive, still not working."
4,The power connectors are a little tight.,"This has help me with a lot of machines that our company was just going to trash. I could take out the HD and test it with this gadget and format it and use the HD if it was good, or discard if it was bad. A very easy process. The SATA to 4 pin power connector was a little tight though."
3,workes great except power supply,This product has worked great on all drives tested. This Includes 2.5 and 3.5 in. IDE and SATA drives. The only problem I had was that the power supply was dead on arrival. Hopefully this is not typical.
5,Very charming and thorough book.,"This was the first book I got from American Girl when I was little, and I really enjoyed it and remember being quite impressed with it even back then. The illustrations are cute, and the texts/lectures are quite useful. The author tries to convey lessons in different ways and in a manner in which girls would be more receptive to them, including through quizzes and games, all of which are all good common sense. Topics covered include everyday manners, greeting people, hanging out with friends, using good manners in public, staying polite but firm in your personal safety, eating at fancy restaurants, etc. The tone is not the least bit condescending, but personable, like many of the American Girl books, I would later come to discover. There is a newer edition to this book (A SMART GIRL'S GUIDE TO MANNERS), but the text is all the same excepting an addition about online safety and ""Netiquette"" (with Instant Messaging and emails, etc.)."
1,Not Worth the 40 dollars,I do not believe that Richard Lueptow is selling this book. Did he ever use it? Do not waste your time with the book. Use theSolidWorks on-line help instead!!
3,A difficult job,"This wasn't a bad movie. Far from it. All involved did a fine job, considering the herculean idea of putting Moby Dick to film.Gregory Peck did the best he could, although he was probably miscast (he himself admitted it). Perhaps Anthony Quinn would have been a better choice. And I can't really see Richard Baseheart as Ishmael.Moby Dick is one of the most difficult books to put to film. This is hampered by the fact that few people truly understand the underlying meaning of the book - and no film has ever hinted at this. You may wish to read my review of the book for clarification ([...])Perhaps someday someone will produce a film worthy of the greatness of the book."
4,Classic!,The actors and the story. But nothing compares to the book. My 11 year old son enjoyed it too!Beware of Capt. Ahab!
3,Moby Dick,The DVD appeared to be a copy of a copy but was still good. I remember seeing it at the movie theater many years ago and the DVD was still good.
4,GREAT BOOK,"""A Touch of Wonder"" is a classic. I bought it back in the early90's for a college psychology class and have re-read it amillion times since then. You can read this book back tofront, front to back, middle, anyway you choose. Each chapteris inspiring and insightful and I highly recommend thisbook to anyone who wants a new lens on life. To learnto appreciate what life is really all about."
1,disappointed!!!,I ordered this CD thinking that there would be at least 10 songs on it. There are three. Two are the same. What a disappointment. I could have downloaded them from ITunes for far less.
4,Silky Soulfull Sweet Voice,"Tasha's World is a very good album, it's their debut album and I'm anxious to hear more from them.If you like nice soul/R&B; like Angie Stone, Jill Scott or Erykah Badu, you will like this album!"
3,"Good, but has too much portrait for the content inside","I bought this book and it's fine but has details the deserve some attention. First, if you see the portrait, where says ""fighting the trompowsky, Torre....etc"" and when you go to the very first page, the phrase has now the word Stonewall. Also gives the impression that, has a entire chapter talking about the Stonewall, however if you see the content page, there is no chapter about Stonewall, it just only a part of the Rare Lines chapter. I've started to look for some lines against Stonewall, and only it has a very small portion about some stonewall formation (p 137) and only have one game talking about stonewall. The book really advise player like me of how to handle d4 desviation but this book has too much portrait for the contents inside."
2,Too Expensive,Unless you need to build an entire Office solution using Access and VBA the Microsoft Office is just a gouge.Plus I hate the Ribbon. Bring back menus and toolbars.
2,Vista doesn't measure up to XP,"Having suffered through Office on Win98 - ME - 2000, I was actually pleased with Office XP. Vista is a letdown. Two major oh-no's:- The help is useless. Searching for a unknown term or reference produces a long list of possible articles, but the searched term may not show up in any of them. I don't have hours to puruse through mindless unrelated articles. XP help highlighted the searched term; it worked fine. Why did they ruin it?- The location of various menu items is scrambled. I don't mean 'rearranged', I mean scrambled. Drawing in Word or PowerPoint is an exercise in frustration. It's one menu to create an object, a different one to flip or group, etc. I'm sure the new arrangement makes sense to someone, I'm just not sure that someone is playing with a full deck.I'm still looking for redeeming features. I'll update this if/when I find some."
4,Great Improvement over other releases of Microsoft Office,"I have been working with Microsoft Office since it was first released by Microsoft. But this is the best release so far. Once you get use to the new ribbon interface, the products flow so much better. The ribbon interface is the best upgrade to the Microsoft Office products. I use the interface in all of the products except of course in Publisher were the old interface is still in place. It is much easier working with the ribbon interface because all the tools that you need are right in front of you."
1,Microsoft employee use Macs,It took approx 60 hours over two month to sucessfully complete the installation. I had many problem with Microsoft of the past comflicting with Microsoft of the present. When I shared my frustration with employees at Microsoft I learned many of the employees at Microsoft use Mac for their home use. They suggested I Buy a Mac.At one point I just wanted to return the product. The seller was great and he was willing to take the product back.
4,MS Office Prof. 2007 Upgrade,"I am finding that it is not so diffucult to navigate my way around the new programs of Excel, Word etc. Opening up files - it tends to be a bit sluggish. On the plus side I found Word 2007 seems to do a much better job of lining up indents. In Word 2003 our indents were sometimes off by a half space which bothered us."
4,Used for university class reference,"We use Intro to Java Programming by Liang for class, but our instructor always refers to the Absolute Java book for better examples. After paging through this book i can already tell the better explinations and code examples."
2,Very frustrating book!,"I don't understand all the good ratings at all. While the author should be commended for tackling some advanced items such as copy constructors and their use, the presentation is poor. As the reader goes through code samples, he/she is invariably sent to a previous chapter for part code as the author, for whatever reason, couldn't be bothered to include. One of my favorites is Display 5.20 on p. 305. the code is for an equals method with a superimposed author comment, ""The complete definition of equals is given in the answer to Self-Test Exercise 37, and is a better version that the one given in chapter 4."" Huh? Why bother putting samples at all. My advice is buy the Deitel book,Java How to Program (early objects) (9th Edition) (Deitel), then find some supplementary info on Copy Constructors, Clone, and overriding methods in the Object class."
2,"Lexar products usually pretty good, BUT","You may find the Lexar USB 2 Multicard Reader does not work with your computer. Or if it does work, it works erratically. Lexar is way behind the times on providing drivers for both Windows and Macintosh. In Mac OS X, the operating system -- supposedly -- should mount a disc without a driver for the card reader. In practice, this sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.My suggestion: if you know what kind of card you will have to read (Compact Flash, Smartmedia, etc.), get a reader specifically for that card type."
2,Works for a while,I'm on my 2nd one of these and they both developed some sort of short in the cable. I have to wiggle the cable and turn it upside down and sideways for for it to be on. It's just not a coincidence that this happened twice. BUY ANOTHER CARD READER! Don't bother with this one or else you'll be buying another one in a few months.
1,Not reliable,"Reads all of the CF cards I have tried, but does not read SD cards. Even Lexar Extreme SD cards don't show up. I figure it would at least work with their own cards. Wasted $15, stick to Sandisk and Kingston"
2,Does not work with large SD cards,"Buyer beware. This reader does not work with large SD cards. I could not get it to work with a new 4 GB SD card. My 1 GB cards work fine, but anything over that will probably not work. I confirmed with with Lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet."
2,doesn't work with FujiFilm xD type M cards,"Tried to use FujiFilm 1GB xD cards, type M, doesn't recognize them. Still trying to resolve situation with Lexar, they say that despite package claim of xD compatibility another reader model RW023 is needed."
4,a little dark,"this book is very good, but i think it's a little dark. but anyways it's only a book! a very good book. just stay away from magic shops!"
4,rich with good material,"I like this CD by Kim Richey a lot, which is interesting because it's not really the music I've usually been into. It's best described overall as alt-country, I guess, with folksy aspects. It's a low-key album with simple music and simple production. The songs are good. Indeed, if the second half of the album had been as strong as the first half, this might have gotten 5 stars. Here's my favs:Those Words We SAidJust My LuckEvery River - cool, crunchy guitarI'm Alright - good slow tune with banjo pickingI KnowThe Circus Song"
5,Nothing like it!!!!!!!,"I have volumes 1,2,3,4 and 5 and can't wait for another to come out. RAD & QUICK put these mixes together soo well. I travel alot and these CD's always go w/ me. I couldn't wait to get them on my Ipod. Everyone I let here them can't wait to copy them even before the CD is finished playing. These guy's are from Cleveland, OH. usually when a cd comes out I get them at CD and tape outlet in Columbus, OH.(home of the BUCKEYE'S baby!). If you get a chance to buy any of these CD's GET 'EM they are classics for any mixed tape fan!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Several standouts, some filler","This is my first Covenant CD, I wasn't sure what to expect. The sound is really darker synthpop with some overtures of industrial.Covenant is definitely the best dressed (as in wearing suits onstage) band out there. They really shine on the punchier dance floor anthems, it's when things slow down that I find them just ok; I much prefer VNV nation in that area.That being said, ""Like Tears in the Rain"" gets things off to a great start, very danceable. Things turn average until ""Helicopter"", a really interesting tune. ""Tour De Force"" gets thing moving again.If ""Dead Stars"" can't turn you onto Covenant, nothing will. It's a dancefloor anthem, very dark Depeche Mode. ""One World One Sky"" is a great followup, but things weaken on the closing ""Still Life"" and the silent ending track.All in all, the strengths here outnumber the weaknesses and I will definitely check out more Covenant in the future."
3,United States Of Mind: Covenant could have done better,"Covenant has always been known for their intelligent, simple, and somehow addictive industrial music. ""United States Of Mind"" is a bit of a change from Covenant's style they've become known by, as it favors more of a synth-pop sound. Some tracks stay true to their heritage, such as ""Like Tears In Rain"" and ""Tour de Force"". Although some tracks seem sort of empty, because they lack intelligent lyrics or an uplifting beat. If you're looking for an album to introduce yourself to the sound that made Covenant famous throughout Europe, buy their previous album ,""Europa"", instead."
2,Tedious,"and boring. The characters are one dimensional and the language is flat (maybe the translation loses something). I've only finished half the book and someday, if I ever run out of things to read, I may pick it up and finish it."
5,No Surprises Here!,Alan Jackson is one of the best country singers of all times. This CD just goes to prove that Alan will always have what it takes! I have to say WWW.Memory is my favorite!
3,HUGE Grip,"This is a very comfortable grip, but adds WAY too much size to grip for me, and reduces Feel as an expense.....High Comfort level, but comfort and feel are often misinterpreted as the same characteristic when they most definitely are not"
2,Not as good as its previous version,"Needs work. The counter box hangs so low is can be difficult to run against many surfaces. Also, the counter has trouble resetting. The handle is curved to be ergonomic, but what happens in the field is that it gets off kilter within a couple of uses and then is REALLY uncomfortable in the hand."
2,Stop her before she writes another,"A buddy lent this to me to read on a trip. I had read her other Japan book and thought it was horrible. This one has improved little, although this time she did not spend page after page reporting on what the Armed Forces radio was playing. She has turned into a Japan explainer of the type we had years ago and thought we were rid of when the ""revisionist school"" became accepted. Well, now we have a quasi bike story and a quasi chrysanthinum club J-apologist hybrid. Overly long, nothing new or deep about Japan. Not much a a travel tale either. ..."
5,Buddy Holly Story & La Bamba,"Both great stories of two legends of rock 'n' roll.A must for collectors of documentary style, but with events from their lives from those who knew them best. Great price & Quality!"
1,It CHIPS Baaaaadddd!,"I really liked the look of this dinnerware. I bought a ton of it, service for 12 and lots of completer pieces. It is all having to be replaced with something else. It chips worse than any dishes I have ever used."
4,Great Item,I recently got this card after hearing the horror stories with the Linksys cards. I love this card it give me great coverage all over my house. I am using it with a Linksys router. Great Buy!
2,"really, really disappointing.","This book suffered from disjointed writing, unfinished teasers and lack of love in the love story. The ending was horribly abrupt, the plot was both hackneyed and ridiculous and the characters .. what a disappointment.Ms. Forster seemed to want to paint everyone with such a bad brush that we couldn't help but love our heroine in contrast. It didn't work. The sex scenes were rather hot - quite nice in fact, but not enough emotion in them to convince me that these two should be in love by the end of it. Mr Forster gets a star for realism, not having a virginal heroine, and incorporating child who isn't a vision of sweetness and light. She loses 3 stars because by the time I finished I said to myself ""wow. That was bad."" and immediately put it into my giveaway pile."
4,Loved it but...,I bought this book while away on vacation knowing nothing of this author. I loved the book but was disappointed that the ending was so abrupt. An epilogue would have been appropriate. This will not keep me from reading Ms. Forster's other however.
2,Too small and flimsy,"This product is, in my opinion, not worth the money. It is too small to properly fit the cart that I have (which Amazon advertised as an option for my cart), doesn't attach well to the cart, and it is made of rather flimsy material. It cost me $14.63 after shipping, and it is not worth it."
4,good for weekly grocery tour :),We bought this about a month ago. It's big enough to carry weekly grocery needs.
2,Bummer,"The cart isn't what I had hoped for. It goes in a straight line just fine, but it doesn't turn corners at all. I have to pick it up and place it in the direction I want it to go. The wheels hook together with cheap materials. I wouldn't buy this one again!"
1,Bad Reception,"All I can say is don't buy these phones. The reception is not good at all. We have the base unit set up in the bedroom. If I go more than 40 feet away I start to get noise, static, or whatever you want to call it when talking to someone. We've had a 900 MHz cordless phone with the base unit set up in the same place and the reception was always good. Also if your talking on one of the phones, someone else cannot pickup the other phone and join in on the conversation. I returned these phones 1 day after I bought them."
1,Spotty at best,"I own this system and have owned VTECH phones in the past - this will be my last. Sometimes the phones connect; sometimes they don't - seems to be their choice. I also have an (older) Panasonic system in the house which works great all the time. CAVEAT EMPTOR - you get what you pay for here - poor quality and spotty connections. On the plus side: when they do connect, the sound and voice quality are excellent and when operating, the battery life does seem long."
1,Stopped working after 4 uses,This hot pot took about 30 minutes to bring water to a boil. I didn't mind the wait but it stopped working after 4 uses. The light would come on inside the unit so it was receiving power but it would no longer heat. Very disappointing.
2,Don't accidentally leave it on with no liquid!!!!,"I accidentally left the mug plugged in less than a minute after pouring out the water and smelt burning and then unplugged it immediately. The next time I tried to use it, the water leaked out right away and discovered the interior bottom of the mug was all melted around the heating element. When it did work, it took forever to boil 8oz of water. Get what you pay for I guess: cheap price but cheaply made."
2,Not worth it. Takes forever.,"It took over 20 minutes to heat 12 ounces of water for a tiny little bodum of coffee. The lid doesn't close watertight, and it snaps on and off, rather than screwing down, so be careful when you pop that cap off a pot of boiling water. There has to be a better device than this one. I didn't find it before this last camping trip, but I will be searching diligently between now and the next one. I'm giving this hotpot two stars, because - eventually - I did get my cup of coffee. I can't give it more, because the thing takes too long, isn't safe, and would be hard to clean if I were going to ever use it again."
3,What?,"After waiting all these years for the release of this series,I would hope that it would be re-mastered. However, This is just a release of the syndication version of the series. But when I watched the ""Stolen Costume"" episode! the copy is so bad and worn out (with the wrong opening titles!) that it makes me wonder what the! And Gary Grossman commentary to boot! Hay Gary! I BET YOUR VERSION IS BETTER THEN THIS ONE! What! Are you kidding!Thank god I still have my memory of the series from the 50's! Yes it was a round picture tube, but it was uncut and pristine! With the original titles!And the end titles of Unknown People with the wrong sound track! And poor video! And the 70's Warner Brothers logo! What! I could go on!But! Who cares!Warner Brothers Don't!"
5,Faster than a speeding bullet,"More powerful than a locomotive.Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.Look! Up in the sky. It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman.Yes it's Superman.Strange visitor from another planet who came to earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.Superman. Who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands.And who, disguised as Clark Kent mild mannered reporter for a daily metropolitan newspaper, fights a never ending battle for truth, justice and the American way.I've never seen it. HA.Can't wait."
4,Relive your youth!,"Get this for your very own even if just to remind yourself of your innocent days as a kid. I don't believe I know anyone that didn't love George Reeves (no relation to Christopher) as Superman. These episodes have a certain charm all their own. Before we became so sophisticated we thought Superman was really the bomb. I must say though, even as a kid, I could never understand why nobody could see that Clark Kent was Superman. All he did was wear glasses as a disguise. I still think George was pretty darn good looking back then.Your older kids may think Superman is lame but the younger kids might get a kick out of it. All of the Superman episodes are kid friendly. You may have to explain the concept of watching tv in black & white though ;) They are still fun to watch and you'll be surprised how much of it you remember. It's wonderful that they finally put these together for us. These will go fast. New viewers will enjoy also. Better pre-order one today!"
1,THE REAL SUPERMAN,"THESE ARE THE REAL ADVENTURES OF THE REAL SUPERMAN. GEORGE REEVES IS SUPERMAN,NOT CHRISTOPHER REEVE. NO BIG BUDGET PRODUCTION WILL EVER OUTSHINE THE GENUINE ARTICLE. LONG LIVE THE MEMORY OF GEORGE REEVES!"
4,"Powerful, charged music","AFI started out as a pretty standard hardcore band with a bratty-sounding lead vocalist and power chords galore. In the past years, though, they've definitely become a good, solid band, drawing on various genres of music to crank out good, solid tunes.They've got stuff on this CD that'll make you slam-dance, stuff that'll make you sway your head, and stuff that'll make you just sit back and close your eyes. Though maybe not as head-banging as the tunes from All Hallow's Eve, or as dark as Black Sails, The Art of Drowning is nevertheless an excellent collection of music for punk fans, rock fans, or just music aesthetes.If all this makes some folks think that this CD is a little wussy, don't be misled. This stuff rocks. Really rocks. But it definitely has a certain refined (or should I say, developed) sound to it that makes it more than just noise."
2,The Art of Drowning is a great release!!,"... The art of drowning was a great release. It got old. fast. real fast. Davy Havok's voice got really obnoxious and agrivating. I really dont like this anymore. If anyone wants my cd and you know who i am, i'll give it to you. I would also like to dispell what I said before about liking blink 182. i dont. i kick myself for liking them. if you want to here some good punk rock, dont turn on the radio, travel out to a decrepit, yet ""cultural-full"" neighborhood. find a small record store/club listen to the music. enjoy. bye."
3,good buy,"this album is good, it is quite commercial and that is unusal for method man but a lot are realy hating on it, i dont think they liked him switchin it up, but the album has good hits and is worth getting, check www.methical.com aswell if your a meth fan, and again its not going to be a classic but its a good album..."
5,Off Da hook!!!!!!!!!!!,"Who ever said that this cd was horrible,does not no music.This is also my first Method Man cd.This cd is great especially the 2nd called""The Prequel"".It's short but it's great.I recommend it to everyone who likes Method Man."
1,6 years! For this????,So finally after 6 years Meth drops his latest. What an utter letdown. This is album is weak. What happened Meth? I hear things that this is not the album you wanted to release but still I could do better. WEAK!!! So angry. Lets just hope Meth can release some of the tracks that were cut by Def Jam. Go the indie way Meth and release the album YOU want. RZA did with Birth of a Prince. Come on.
1,What is this?,"If I could give this album 0 stars or a negative rating, I would. This album is terrible. What happened to the Method Man I once knew? It sounds nothing like the Wu, which is a bad thing. The production is so bad, I can't even stand to listen to the songs. C'mon Meth, you're a Wu member, you have RZA, Mathematics, and Tru Master to get beats from, you don't need P Diddy and Missy Elliot, who are horrible producers anyway. If you can't get production on your album from your own crew, because of your record label, then guess what? LEAVE DEF JAM. There are a few good songs on this album, including The Motto and The Turn with Raekwon (Which is the only RZA produced track). I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this album, it's not even worth the 9 dollars I could buy it for at Best Buy. If you are a fan of that classic Wu sound that Meth once brought, buy the new Masta Killa album. Now that is a great album. For all the real heads, don't buy this garbage."
1,I feel sick...,"One RZA track?! One RZA TRACK!!!! This is not a Wu-Tang CD. ""The Turn"" is the only original production on this entire thing. The other tracksby Puffy and Jelly Roll (uhhh....) are horrible. I can buy a Lil' Flip album or something for this garbage. I've been with Mef since 94' but I'm finished, sorry can't support this."
2,Garbage,"We waited 6 years 4 this album 2 come out, but it sounds like it took him 6 days 2 make. Some people like it, but I think it sucks and it a HUGE dissapointment"
3,Meth's third installment of the Tical,"Meth's third installment of the Tical had many fans scratching their heads as to how will he come out for his latest album. Many were happy, yet many were disapointed. Def Jam are the ones that need the fingers pointed at them as for they were the ones that were behind the creative control of this album. As far as the album goes, it has some cuts that keep your head banging and there are some that the album could do without."
1,Who let him do this ?,Yall get it right.....someone told him this was worth releasing someone told him this ish was hot. Why has this happened ?Lord I need answers. I can't recommend buying this because I'll be in hell burning for lying.
2,DISSAPOINTMENT,i have been waiting for this cd for the longest time and finnaly got it today.It sucks. the beats are horrible and ruin what should have been a five star album. only good songs are the motto and whats happenin.every other song sounds similar and all sound like redman beats and not the old fashion wu beats that i was hopeing for.rza only did 1 beat on the album and even that beat sucked.oh well time to wait for kiss of death in june
2,Disappointing.......,"I was so hyped when I heard that Meth was coming out with an album two years ago. But, after waiting two years for this album, this is HALF ASS. The production is so out of control that no tune or song really exists. The only good tracks are The Turn, The Motto, Afterparty, and We Some Dogs. There are also too many f-ing guest spots! I wanted to hear Meth rip tracks up and for him to actually make good songs, but no. Instead, this album had to go mainstream. You won't find gritty, dark, raw tracks here, like what Method Man has made in the past. Just flashy, beatsy crap. I cannot believe Meth said he was satisfied with this album because now, I truly believe the Wu is gone."
2,2 Stars,"This album was basically garbage i am not a huge Method Man album but i was really lookin forward to get this cd. But when i got it i listened to it and was just disappointed. Only one single was released from the album ""Whats Happenin"" feat. Busta Rhymes which slowing died on Bet. A Second single was never released because there wasnt another song on the album that was any good. ""Rodeo"" a song feat. Ludacris was ok. But I would not go buy this album. I would stick to his first album Tical."
2,not the cd meth wanted...,"If you follow Wu closely, you know this cd is not the final product Meth wanted. We all know Def Jam controls the artists and doesn't allow the artists complete creativity. Rza had reportedly produced around 10 tracks, and in Meth's contrack they said he could have RZA produce a lot of tracks if his albums went gold, which they did. Mainstream people may like this, but true Gods know that this album would have been amazing if Def Jam weren't such control freaks. Only song I like is afterparty with ghostface killah. Buy Masta Killa- No Said Date, due out on June 1st. Going to be an amazing album."
4,Caroline B. Cooney is great!,This is a really suspensive book. I've read this series of the vampire stories. I love all of Caroline's books and trust me. this book is worth reading and you'd wish you buy it.
1,This book needs to be DONE over. Translation or transcription is bad.,"The Place of Pleasure. Volume 1 needs to be pulled and re-transcribed. The book would probably be good if there were not so many spelling errors or typos in the translation. U's are replaced with V's and vise versa and both ENGLISH and American English words are misspelled ""ladyes"" ladies? I am not a good critic, but this book is really difficult to read because of the mistakes and I was only 10% into it.Hope this helps, I love classic literature and read a great deal of it, but I think this is more of a transcribing problem then it is a writing problem. Please check this out and if I am wrong, that this is how its supposed to be, then I am sorry, classic or not, it is poorly represented."
3,Decent but not what I expected,"I lament buying this album on a whim but from listening to the sound samples it sounded pretty good. For the most part, this album is all repetetive guitar solos that just don't do it for me; nothing especially catchy that sticks with you. One minute the band is sonically rising to a guitar squealing climax then 2 seconds later it somehow switches to an out of context ambience. Sure there are some decent songs that don't resemble a ""dime a dozen"" club jazz band such as ""Blues Alley"" and ""Chi Town."" As for the rest of the tunes, they just lack a characteristic that would set them apart from other rock/jazz fusion bands. To me it seems as if the members of Jing Chi were to say one day 'hey lets switch to jazz so we can be cool.' Try Carl Orr's albums ""Mean it"" and ""Absolute Freedom"" if you are into great jazz/rock/funk music."
4,Great costume,I ordered this costume for my daughter 's presentation. She was doing a biography of Buzz Aldrin for school and it was a hit!
5,This book is a real gem!,"Kate does an amazing job of sharing the hard lessons she's learned doing landscaping over the years. She also writes in a style that is very enjoyable to read. Even if you aren't in Northern California there are lots of great tips related to design, drainage, irrigation and planting. I found this book a real gold mine of tips and tricks, guaranteed to make any landscaping project go easier."
4,a new take on the paranormal,"this book strays from the inhuman, demonic from hell type of thinking. it goes into quantom physics, and the rip in time, big bang way of thinking.the only thing imight question is his photos of ghosts. ir lights give off a host of lightrefraction, dust e.t.c. all in all a good read. not for your pop ghost hunter. i book that gives one pause to think."
5,Great New Info,"I definitely disagree with all of those bad reviews. I agree 100% that the body has the ability to heal itself and that virtually nothing a doctor ""sells"" you can help your body heal itself. Let's face it, the medical and pharmaceutical industry is a business. They live off of people getting sick. Now that we know the truth, we can stop this monopoly once and for all."
5,confessions of a medical heretic,Believe it - you have been dumbed down for all your life into believing that drugs and surgery are the answer to your health problems. But it is all about the money!!!
1,Up Jumped the Devil,"This author has some issues to deal with. I couldn't get past the first 1 or two chapters in all three of his books on Kindle store.I agree, completely with the other one-star raters.Maybe he only wants to sell to black readers who have a false stereotypical view of whites in this country???Save your money -not worth the time or $, ""Hidden in Plain View"" & ""Don't Believe Your Lyin' Eyes"" are the other two."
2,"It's not how good it is, but who you know in the business","I read UJTD for two reasons. Someone suggested it was good reading. Secondly, as an aspiring novelist, I like to see how I measure up. Obviously a subjective assessment. But isn't this a subjective business anyway. I thought it was boring. The Androgeneous One was lucidly a drag. Super hero beat reporter? Wasn't that underdog and/or Clark Kent."
5,OEM Trigger Gun Feels Like New,My original Karcher trigger gun lasted about five years. With this OEM product my pressure washer now performs like it did when it was new.
3,"Kindergarteners at The Potomac School, McLean, VA","Our young reviewers enjoyed this sweet story about a grandpa and his grandkids, and agreed that this read-aloud for young children will make the listener feel good. Including both grandsons and granddaughters allowed each kindergartener to identify with one or more of the interests the pair shares-fishing, hiking, camping, singing, reading. Although some would have preferred lengthening the narrative with swimming, tennis, baseball, and corny joke telling, most of these five- and six-year-olds thought this short tale was long enough to convey the love between the generations. The rhyming text and repeating phrase, ""with me,"" were a hit with our students, as were the photo album styled ink-and-watercolor illustrations. The predictable ending disappointed discriminating audience members, who suggested introducing the grandmother on the last page to add an element of surprise."
2,not a good brush for feet,"I was looking for a brush that I could use to clean my feet. I remember when I was young, I had a similar one like this one. However, I tryed to use this brush to do my feet, after applying water and soap, it began to turn red, so I had not use for it any more. I purchase two, so I will use the other one to try to clean something down in the house. If it don't fall apart."
2,"A ""Walk"" though a forest","If you are searching for the sounds from a *walk* in a forest, then this disc is for you. My preference, when I am sitting in my media room, is to immerse myself in a sound field that resembles a *stationary* position, like sitting by an ocean, or hearing a realistic portrayal of rain or a thunderstorm. And this is where this disc falls short.Although most segments sound pretty realistic in isolation, when you listen to the disc from start to end, you quickly get the sense that a sound engineer has ""faded in"" the sound of a brook and then later ""faded it out"" to give you the impression of walking past it. These ""fade ins / fade outs"" occur through the disc, and this is why it falls short of scoring top marks.Depending on whether you seek entertainment or realism, you will either like this disc, or you will be somewhat disappointed by it."
1,Long and awful...,I agree with other reviewers. Neither of the two main characters was likeable at all. They spent the whole book arguing posintlessly about leaving each other. The book could have ended 200 pages sooner and it would have been alright with me. Terrible.
4,"Nothing new, but still worth a buy","Once I heard that this band sadly broke up, I made sure to get my hands on a copy of ""Can't Breahe"" before it got too rare. I'm glad I bumpedit up on my priority list, because it really actually is a pretty good album. Nothing at all groundbreaking, it's just a nice hard rock album that doesn't try to do anything more than just rock, whch is refreshing sometmes. Nothing special, just straight up rock."
3,Not bad compared to similar artists,"I'm not a big fan of the hip-hop influence that's become so common in metal today. Most of the bands are too over the top or focus too much on the hip-hop side for my taste. Boiler Room has its roots in New York hardcore, so they approach the style a little differently. The lyrics are darker and they play heavy, not just loud. It's kind of like Machine Head's ""The Burning Red"". The singer has an awesome voice when he's not screaming or whispering. So, for a debut album, they did pretty good. They could use a little more variety in tempo and songwriting. And where the heck is ""Low Society""? That song freaking rocks! It's an old Boiler Room song that didn't make it on the album."
1,poorly sized,"nice looking gloves but absurdly small for an XL. If you have large hands, these gloves will not fit, period. I regularlyuse an XL and I could not even get my hand in, much less get a feel for the glove."
2,Not Quite,"I wonder if Muffy's therapist suggested writing this book. I had great hopes from the title and her bio,but this is more a personal essay on her own childhood and relationship with her mother than a book on 'slacker' motherhood. While I agree and enjoy some of her ideas, it wasn't the book I'd hoped. This is NOT in the 'Girlfriends Guides' vein, it's more a personal bio and idea of raising her own family."
1,"boring, condescending and just plain irritating!!","OH - I get it...slacker is tongue-in-cheek for ""Oh Muffy, you're doing a GREAT job"" UGH -- give me a break. I don't really know any moms who read parenting books. I guess the world is full of them and they are all judging me. hm - I say ""Who cares?""...We all do the best we can. This borrowed (thank goodness) book infuriated me and I didn't crack a smile once. More of a biography of her family and home life. She didn't really talk about parenting all that much - just herself. I recommend Erma Bombeck (like others have said) or David Sedaris for a REAL humorous look at life."
2,Cynical Look at Parenting,"Played as a humorous book on parenting in the press reviews I read, I was disappointed that ""Slacker"" lacks any traditional humor. It is a cynical look at everything that is wrong with parenting guideance and marketing aimed at parents today. Her attitude seems to be that children should only get the bare minimum in terms of attention, praise, and support.Some of her points are valid, such as the alternatives to giving into every toy whim in ""Toys Aren't Us"", but I found it most hypocritical for someone raising her children via a nanny to be giving advice on parenting. I am suprised with her don't-child-proof-life attitude that she did not just leave them home alone to fend for themselves!For real humor regarding parenting, borrow your mom's old copies of Erma Bombeck's works!"
5,Welcome Humor on a Stressful Topic,"The Slacker Mom book was like a breath of fresh air in the life of a guilt driven try-not-to-be-slacker mom. The author asked and answered questions that I've always had about surviving my children, and having them survive me without damage. I think this book can give you a view of motherhood with the saving grace of a little distance and humor. Read it and laugh, then go enjoy your kids."
3,Good shoe,I bought this shoe for the flexibility of the style. It is great in color and style. Although I did wear the shoe shopping and it made a blister on my little toe. I think once the leather gets a little softer it will be a fantastic shoe to wear any time. Bandolino is a great shoe.
3,somewhat satisfied,"I purchased this product X2 because of the price. I thought what a bang for the buck, however when I received the product one of the black ink cartridges did not work. No matter how many times I ran the maintenance cleaning system on my printer, the cartridge would not print. I inserted the second black ink cartridge purchased and it worked purfectly. So I am happy, somewhat."
3,Remanufactured Lexmark 82 and 83 Printer Ink,The #83 (color) seems to be fine.The black cartridge just did not work in the printer.May not be connecting properly - don't know.
2,PRODUCT IS MISLABELED! BEWARE.,"The title of this DVD is correct: ""None But The Lonely Spy"". However, it is a B/W film that does NOT feature Ken Clark and Bella Cortez, and it is not ""FBI Appelle Istamboul"". I don't know where Sinister Cinema pulled this cover image from, but it is not associated with ""None But The Loney Spy"" - which is film that you will receive."
1,Useless Product,Terrible product from a truly awful company. Do yourself a favor and just don't enter the world of frustration that is Pinnacle Systems. I hope this company goes out of business soon.
4,A Great Return,"This is the second Capstick book I have read (the first being ""Death in the Long Grass""), and again I was not dissapointed. In this book he takes the role of the safari client--having retired as professional hunter--, and gives us more of an insight on what it is like to be the client on a big game hunting safari in Africa. He vividly describes the sights, sounds, smells, and the very essence of the Dark Continent."
4,Worth the time,"Julie Morgenstern has created an easy-to-read book describing a complete program of organizing your life. I like the book's set-up because it is also easy to read in segments, even out of order."
4,"Good time management book, but...","Morgenstern has a somewhat unique take on time management, making the comparison of organizing your space to organizing your time. While this comparison is helpful in understanding the need to fit your activities into a container of time and to ""toss"" activities out of your schedule, at times the analogy seems stretched. Overall though, the tips for streamlining tasks and managing the various activities of life are helpful.NOTE: This reviewer is the author of ""Never Be Late Again, 7 Cures for the Punctually Challenged."""
2,"Absorbing detail, just way too much of it","I greatly appreciated the absorbing depictions of the everyday life of a slave during this period. It felt believable and engrossing. However, the book should have been half the length. Scenarios, thoughts, daily life details are repeated over and over. By halfway through the book, you will know all you need to know and can stop reading. I wish I had."
3,Could have used a little editing,"I didn't give this three stars because of the controversy around racism. It's historical fiction, fiction being the key word. And I didn't really pick up that tone from it at all. I thought it was an innovative retelling using what information we do know and filling in the blanks from there. The reason I gave it three stars is because it contained all sorts of things that I felt could have been cut from the book and it wouldn't have mattered. I almost gave up on it in the second section. I'm glad I finished it, but it was a little tough to keep interest in it."
2,If you value your data look else where,"My company got several of these drives, and the biggest problem we have had with this is data being corrupted. You think files are on the drive and safe only to find out they are corrupt. I would avoid and go with Western Digital or Seagate USB solution."
4,OH THOSE SECRETS,"Here's another sizzler set in Hollywood, this time in the 1930's. The lives of the movers and shakers in TABOO are a roller coaster ride of sins and secrets and of unattainable happiness. Gage's two main sufferers, Kate Hamilton and Joseph Knight, go through the melodramatic motion of uniting then paying the price for it. But it's Eve Sinclair, the child superstar, who really makes TABOO a delicious romp. Her cold-hearted volcanic temperament will make any fan of Valley of the Dolls stand up and cheer.-----Martin Boucher"
5,www.valderbeebeshow.com,"marriage and motherhood before risking all of her earthly and emotional possessions as she answered a calling in her heart that continued to say, ""There is more for you in life."" Creating a legacy for her family, she brought her great-grandmother's (a slave) syrup recipe to life as Michele Foods. The syrup became a metaphor for the birth of the person Michelle became on her journey of building a business with few resources and little knowledge of the product or the food industry."
5,This is the best movie ever made!,"I love this movie. The songs are wonderful. I could sit and watch this movie everyday. I showed it to my friends and now whenever I see them, they are humming or singing the songs. The best movie ever."
5,I love it,"I truly am enjoying every episode of Married with Children. I did re-package the DVD's, making them easier to find. I also cut and pasted the content sheet on each jewel case so that I knew which episodes were in each DVD. Great value. I would recommend it to anyone. Note: When I viewed them on TV originally, I thought they were somewhat risque, however, now compared to what is shown on TV, they are mild and funny."
4,Good Price for these TV Classic Episodes!,"No frills packaging or ""special content""...just the episodes. I love it! The only thing that sucks is that the original theme song is not included, but you don't really need it to enjoy these episodes. If you are a true Bundys fan, you'll hear the original theme song in your head during the opening credits :)"
2,Not for foreigners without english knowledge,"The package of the DVDs is poor, and the information that is subtitled, like we see on Amazon description on ""Format: Box set, Color, DVD, Full Screen, Subtitled, NTSC"" is wrong. Dont have any subtitles at all. Badly made menus and poor image too, unfortunatly. Ive seen lots of bad movies and bad series being released around the world, but this series never got the treatment it deserved. One of the best shows ever and got this very poor treatment by Sony. Hope someday we get a proper release."
2,Just a collection of previous releases,"While a complete series collection is always a good thing, the most important thing to keep in mind is that it still has the flaws of the previous releases. The theme is still missing and replaced by generic music, the episodes are still cut and are syndicated versions, and price is a few dollars more than buying the seasons separately. That will probably fall over time.A good deal if you're a fan, but nothing has been fixed. All the discs are still the same from their original releases. No theme, cut episodes, et cetera."
5,Classic!!!!!,This is a classic cd. Years ago this was my first album by Mr. Hayes. It is a pleasure to have it in CD format. The music has wonderful orchestration as well as the great brass section not to mention how he tells the stories in his remakes of other songs. I highly recommend this cd.
4,Superb soul of the highest order,"This is a truly fantastic soul album that is easily enjoyable by all and is a requirement for any eclectic music lover.The only minor gripes I have with this album that prevent me from giving it five stars are: the last song ""By the Time I Get To Phoenix"", which is an overly long and thoroughly self-indulgent spoken-word piece, and the mediocre mastering (since rectified by the Mobile Fidelity Koch SACD release, which is unfortunately not playable on normal CD players) quality.The first three songs are absolute masterpieces, well worth the price of admission."
5,Soulful * Must Have,"If you're from this era, you must have this AND Black Moses. They do bring back the memories. :)"
4,Solid buy,"I bought this edition of Historical Geology for two bucks. It's an older book at this point, but the vast majority of the book still has relevant information. I'd really reccomend it for some one just looking to brush up on information with out having to pay textbook prices."
3,Travel Ease,"Sounds like a great product...exactly what I'm looking for. Except, can't there be other colors than black? I'm not buying black. I'm waiting for Navy blue to match my luggage; burgundy to match my son's luggage; multicolored for my sister; forest green to match my mother's luggage."
3,Transfer,"The transfer leaves quite a bit to be desired. The picture (video) portion is only so-so though at one point I was thinking it might have come from a VHS tape but I am not sure of that or how the transfer to DVD was made. I really think the picture quality could have been better. The sound also left a lot to be desired and there was a background noise from beginning to end which did not help intelligability. I am adding this to my movie library as I enjoy the story , as simple as it is and to compare it to the 1951 version with Debra Paget. I will try this on an upsampling Blu ray player and hopefully get some visual and audio improvement. Considering it is 1932 I am happy to have this edition."
3,Paddle,"Inexpensive...weapon retention is moderate to good but not the best...the build is on the ""soft""side so you have to adjust it's position over a whole day of carrying but all in all for the price it's a decent rig....I wouldn't necessarily recommend for concealed DUTY..but for the everyday person should be all good..a better option for more money would be one of the rigid molded rigs...but the soft comfort of this holster is a bonus..."
4,Singers ego got in the way of metal might,"Saxon should have been huge in the flood of the NWOBHM, but singer Biff Byford's ego got in the way. He claimed that they were better the both Maiden and Def Leppard, I think not.With that said this is a good showcase of their songs. Remasterd and with two bonus tracks [*] this is a great cd that shows what this band can do. Metallica opened for them in San Fran in 1980 during their ""Denim & Leather"" tour. So thay have been around.If you are looking to get into this band try this as well as ""The Eagle Has Landed"" Parts 1 and 2, and ""Wheels Of Steel"" if you like good 80s British Metal you will like this."
5,REVIEW,This is one of my most favorite cd's by Kirk Franklin. This is child hood up-bringing old school gospel. It took me a while to find it but I finally did. The company I ordered from sent this to me within a week. AWESOME!!!!!
3,kirk franklin cd,"Love Kirk Franklin, but the song selections weren't that good and he's not singing most of them. Would not recommend this album to anyone"
1,it's never s easy as you think,"I purcashed the new NIS 2005 to replace my older copies of sameit won't un-install what it needs to by itself, i was on a help chat for 4 hours, trying to re-configure my computer, constantly re-installing and un-installing. now i have complelty removed all my anti virus and security software. and have nothing but a mess. if the box says it works for windows 2000 it should work without having to find on-line patches and fixs that take up your day and make your computer crash"
3,I did not like it as much as I thought I would.,It was not as much music as I expected. It was boring and I ordered 2 by mistake. Live and learn.
5,beautiful,"I'm kind of new to meditation (just a few years in) and after doing guided meditations for a long time, and always being drawn to the meditations that had Tibetan Chants in the background, I thought it would be interesting to purchase an entire album of them. This is perfect- for some reason these chants spark something inside me.On a bit of a side note: when I played the songs for the first time (I purchased all three mp3s) I could have sworn I heard some of this before. I realized that these may be the songs that the Beastie Boys sampled on their song ""Bodhisattva Vow""."
5,Good stuff,"It might take a listen or two to really appreciate this. My friend introduced me to it once as a ""meditation time"" chant. Basically we both will once a year find a nice comfy couch, lay down, chill out, and listen in the dark to this chanting. Its quite interesting to listen to if your open minded about it. For me it has some sentimental value, but I'm sure others could find it enjoyable as well."
1,"this is a novel, not history","I am compelled to comment because of a previous review that called this book a ""study"" and believed it to be an accurate representation of people, place, and time. This is a novel, nothing more. Cooper represents his own time period's thought process within the writing of a Gothic novel. If you want to know more about the Mohawk, Oneida, and Mahican people please read a more recent history and do NOT rely on fiction."
3,Three and a half stars.,"This book has a powerful tale. It is just difficult for modern readers to read. Once I got used to his style of writing I liked Cooper's plot and characterization. I fell in love with Scout and Chingagook. I didn't want anything to happen to them. This book is a classic because it puts a story in the context of a time period and does it well. Again, its only downfall is its language, but that goes with the territory."
3,Off and on again reading,"This is possibly a very good book for readers who are interested in this type of reading. I just couldn't stay interested, I may go back as I have several times and retry reading, but not for awhile."
1,Mark Twain was right!,"I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished. It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading."
5,An action packed book about one groups journey in the U.S.,"I really enjoyed this book because it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It really captures how dangerous life really was in the late seventeen hundreds. Also, how indian tribes didn't like each other. The title ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is really what the story is about."
4,Another Age,"A famous classic written in a style that would confound most writers today. The use of language, vocabulary etc. shows a grasp of the English language that is unheard of today."
3,Endurance test,"I would have to say that I expected more from this book than I got in the final analysis. Still, I am glad I read it. Wonder why they had to change the movie so much from the book?And, of course, it was much too long-winded for a reader, like myself, that does not ""skim"".I thought the ending was a bit too abrupt, especially when considering the marathon pace of the rest of the book. Perhaps Cooper meant this to be taken so...Also, The insight into racism was astonishing for something that was written in the 1800's (NOT the 1500's like another reviewer mentions)."
1,never read but have too... sounds boring,i have never read this book but i have to and i must admit that after reading what others' people opinions were of it i don't want to read it. thank you!
4,Slow start but perfect ending.,This Doctor who story starts out slow but definately redeems itself later in a conclusion that gives insight on the enemy of our enemy.
4,A much underrated and oft-forgotten Dr.Who thriller,"This story is a fine example of Dr.Who at its Gothic best; a small cast, as suffocatingly-claustrophobic setting as one could imagine, and Tom Baker at his best, just weeks before both he and the series topple into wide-eyed parody in later more self-indulgent adventures. Paddy Russell directs with a surprising flair for the material and Terrance Dicks delivers a sharp, character-driven script. The monster of the piece, the amorphous Rutan, has been much criticised but is actually quite a disturbingly-alien adversary; the episode ending of part 3 - the creature's blood-curdling cry sounding in the night - is one of the last spine-tingling Dr.Who moments the show was able to deliver. All in all, a superb story, showing why Dr.Who was always at its best without struggling to come to terms with spaceships and rayguns."
3,"No flix, distracting logo","This watch was advertised with the flix nightlight system, which it does not have. I like the other features, however my biggest problem is with the logo on the watch face. The silver & red logo is very distracting & makes it hard to read the date. You cannot see the bright reflective silver in pictures to be able to tell it would interfere with seeing the display easily."
5,Wondeful Heathen Music,"Very moving songs, wonderful lyrics, and a great testement to the Gods of Nordic spirituality."
1,Bad quality and customer service,"After the 6 month of possession, this TV went down miserably. Oneday, while I was watching the tv, I heard the 'pop' noise from the speaker and the picture went out. After a second or two, when the picture finally came back on, I noticed the semi-transparent vertical streaks across the screen. The artifact was like watching the tv through a screen door. The picture still goes out time to time but the vertical streaks remain the same.Toshiba tried to have someone come out to repair the tv for 3 month without success (couldn't find a repair shop near by Topeka, KS). After I filed the complaint to AG's office and BBB, Toshiba finally decide to give me a refund but it will take another 4 more weeks.When this tv works, it works great but now I have serious doubt about this product and Toshiba's customer service (one of the worst I've ever had). I just hope that nobody has to go through what I have been going through for the past 3 months."
5,YEP!! ONE of Harley's BEST!!,"GREAT, GREAT recording. Always great lyrics, etc.They are ALL great songs but my fav is ""Saturday Night at the Fair"".WOW!(Note: if you're not a fan u should become one. Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel music IS original but in the vein of Ian Hunter, Bob Dylan, David Bowie...)"
5,Emergency Dialer,This item was literally a lifesafer. We were the primary caregiver of my mother in law and she lived in an adjacent town. We set it up to call my wife and myself.It was a very reliable device andserved us well. You do need a phone line in the house to use it.
3,A decent read - not very cerebral,"David Hagberg is a good writer. However, some times the plot leaves a lot to be desired. In this particular book, many times the plot has big gaping holes and implausible scenarios. At times it is hard to believe that experts in the military\intelligence arena could be so dumb. The hero, McGarvey is likeable and cool. The story started off well and the trouble in post cold-war Russia is believable. However, it could have been developed much more intelligently. Looks like Hagberg simply did not care enough about certain details, which matter to habitual spy-genre readers. Not being able to blow up the train - COME ON!!!! The french girl is hopeless.Still an absorbing read (exploits readers who are so caught up with the genre that they would gobble up anything), enough to pick up another ones of Hagberg's works, and going by reviews there seems to be better stuff from him, some of it writing as Sean Flannery."
1,It's the thought that counts,"Somebody gave me this book for a gift, and I really have to say it's the thought that counts. I've read two other books by David Hagberg, in the hopes that he could get one right just by the law of averages. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed. I can name many other authors who are more than adequate substitutes for him, books that make you think(Tom Clancy, Larry Bond, Stephen Coonts, Len Deighton, John Le Carre, Frederick Forsyth, just to name a few). If you want to read a book about a resurgent Russia, read Icon by Frederick Forsyth. The bestseller lists are a good acid test for the techno-thriller genre. If it doesn't make it there, it's probably not worth reading."
2,Ho Hum and not very believeable,"Read several books by this author. His character, Kirk McGarvey, is weak and the plot of the story is not believeable. If the book was rated by the word or number of pages, then I would rate higher. This is a 500 page book that could be condensed into a about 200 pages without losing anything.Bottom line would be to save your money and wait until the book shows up in a ""book trade"" used paper back store."
2,Not as good as his others,"This would be the third novel I've read by Hagberg featuring ""super-spy"" Kirk McGarvey. I wish I knew what this guy was made of. Runs 10 miles per day, drinks with every meal, smokes up a storm, has the patience of Mother Theresa, tons of cash, beautiful women sent to spy on him, master minipulator of men, fluent in umpteen languages.You would think even in a state of poverty and difficult times the military could stop a train. For a french ""spy"" Jacquline is pretty sad. Elizabeth is horrid at best and manages to do in a few commandos and fight off the East German lesbian. At least Ryan gets fired. Don't waste your money, I just told you the story in 500 less pages. By the way, the best part of the book is the Tarantula, his bi wife, and Chernov/Bykov. They are the anti-heroes and they almost make this book bearable-almost."
2,More complex than necessary; Handle flimsy; Bulky,"The egg wave can do a bunch of cool stuff, but I tossed it aside when I saw a $2.49 microwave omelette maker at Target. It's much better for cooking eggs flat, for breakfast sandwiches. And it takes up far less space. Get the Egg Wave if you want scrambled eggs. Otherwise, get something else.Also, the handle is flimsy and useless. The packaging tells you not to put more than 2 egg waves in the microwave at the same time, so why would they sell you 4, and a handle, too? Go figure."
1,messey,not what expected very messy to use had to clean out the micro wave when used so will sell it on my next garage sale..
1,Stick to Comedy Central,They are good on TV but the game is terrible. Worst game I ever played. Has nothing to do with South Park
1,buyer beware!!!,I ordered this book and never recieved it from the seller... i sent several messages and they never replied either.good thing it was only a fews dollars!!i will never make a purchase from international books again!thanks for reviewing my comments..
4,Review #1: The Amadeus Book of the violin,"This book is splendid, talking about the history,playing and the construction of Violins. This Book reveals secrets about the old Italian varnishes, eyewitness accounts of Paganini's performances, bow making, and Ideal thicknesses for places on the bridge. Also, a comparison of different f-holes, string making, bow holds, harmonics, how famous people tested thier strings,the ""bach bow"", and experiments conducted on the violin are also included. A must see to believe! Indispensible!Way too much to type here!"
5,Excellent Artists,I love Kirk Franklin music. I have all of his CD's except both of the christmas 1997 and 1998. It's very good that he is keeping the younger generation off the streets with this new project he is doing. Now i see people that i thought would never sing gospel are now singing it. Keep up the great work and god bless you all.
5,You'll Leave THIS Planet,"Ever stumble upon an album that seems to be one idea from start to finish, and any change in sequence would destroy it's power? I own maybe four of these. The Burner was right on with this theme. Leaving this planet is what I put on to burn-n-churn thru over an hour's worth of intense work. If you have to purchase just one Charles Earland album- THIS is the Masterpiece. Thank YOU Charles- R.I.P."
5,Daughter's favorite!,My daughter is now 12 and everytime we go through her books to give some away this one never and will never make the cut. It's in our house to stay. Love it!
5,STRONG AND POWERFUL,"Amasing, strong and powerful. What else can one say about one of the best writers of the world?"
2,Not recommended.,"When my original Nvidea video card (the one that came in the computer)went bad, I replaced it with a ATI video card. After 2-3years when I again started having some video problems, I purchased the same Nvidea card that came in the computer and replaced the ATI card. The video problems I was experiencing evidently was not caused by the video card. The text on the screen (e.g., labeling of short cuts on the desktop)with the Nvidea card was so much inferior to that seen with the ATI card that I put the ATI card back in. I recommend spending several dollars more to get a better video card than this Nvidea card."
5,"Funny name for perfume, but excellent scent!",I had a very small sample of this perfume and decided I loved it so much I wanted a big bottle. My husband found this for me as a birthday gift and I use it almost every day. The scent is not light and to me smells like fresh air after rain with flowers.
5,Objective Story,"While I always thought I knew the story and the mythology of the Olympic Hockey Team for the first team everyone involved with it was treated as a human being. Even with all the human foibles that the author describes everyone comes across as even greater. You realize how great the US team was. In addition the Soviets are seen as human beings not the monolithic communists that have been previously portrayed. After reading the book you come away with a love of hockey.Even if you think you know all about the Olympic Hockey Miracle, Think Again."
5,A must read for all hockey fans,Gave this book to my husband for his birthday he read it in 2 days. He said it was one of the best written books about the USA 1980 Team.
5,Great Hockey Story,"I reommend The Boys of Winter for you to read. It is a great story of the 1980 hockey team.The goalie on the team, Jim Craig, tells the story. It is from his perspective. So he also tells you what it was like behind the mask.There are a lot of flashblacks in the book. Herb Brooks died in 2003, so his funeral is also included . It also goes into the lockerroom to see what life was like in there. It is a great story and I definitely recommend it for you to read."
1,Piece of Junk,"I liked this little timer when I first got it. It has lasted me a whole 5 weeks. Wow! What a quality product. (sarcasm!) When you push the buttons to set the minutes or seconds, the timer goes crazy and counts up at a rapid rate that you can't stop. The start and stop button now only works about one out of 10 times. Don't waste your money."
1,"Timer is much, much too quiet!!","The design of the timer is beautiful, but if you cannot hear it when the time is up, so what good is it!!! I can bearly hear it when I am next to it. Not Good!!! I would not buy another!!!"
4,Pleased,"I'm quite pleased.Only wish it had a clip, to clip in my blouse or pants. It has a ring where one can put a cord to hang it around the neck, but it's a little heavy and bothersome around the neck.Also wish it had a button for hours (it only has minutes and seconds. Seconds????)But it's ok, i like it!"
2,Buttons fall off after three uses,"This is another piece of money-eating plastic - don't buy it!! I should have gone with the Sunbeam model my mom has been using for 10 years.After just a few weeks of light, occasional use, the minute button has fallen out completely and can't be fixed. CDN: we did not drop the timer, jab the timer hard, or otherwise do anything but use the timer as directed. It's not even directly over the oven, so heat is not the issue. Your product is terrible. For $2, this might be acceptable. For $10-$12? Forget it.Avoid."
4,Arrived super fast; but alarm is TOO loud. Not good for test-timing/studying,"I got this so I could time and improve my test-taking skills. NOT for cooking. I ought to have verified prior to purchasing, but it's a shame I cannot ""silence"" the alarm...On the good side, it arrived extremely quickly"
1,Timer resets itself when I don't want it to!,"There is no way to turn it off so in order to save the battery you will need to take it out after each usage and my timer keeps resetting back to 00:00, soooo frustrating! If I set it either to count-down or count-up it will go for a few minutes and then it just goes right back to the 00:00, it is not reliable."
3,timer works ok,Bought this for a hearing impaired relative of mine. It works fine but the sound is not loud enough for them.
3,sound,"The alarm sound is not loud enoughWhy should the numbers be shone when not in useI know it might not use much battery power,but why not have an off switch."
3,Disappointing volume,"The timer part of the unit is great but the loud part of the described ""loud and long alarm"" is completely false--it is just too quiet to be effective or trustworthy. If you have any music or other sounds going on or are in the next room when it goes off good luck hearing it. Some reviewers mention the same problem and suggest putting in your pocket but with the protruding buttons I quickly found it was too easy to change the settings. But the ""long"" part of the alarm is accurate--a full minute of the sound seems way too long (unless you can't hear it, of course). It will do the job for the moment but I am disappointed..."
3,Component Design TM15 Big Digit Timer,Timer has large digits as described but the alarm volume is too soft and difficult to hear if not in the same room as the timer.
2,"If you are looking for a loud timer, this is NOT FOR YOU","The display on the timer is bigger than most, but the sound leaves something to be desired. I wanted something loud so I could hear it from 15 feet away - this was not it. The timer is okay for when you have it next to you or 5 feet away, but not really so good when it's further than that."
1,Never shuts off,There is no on / off switch on this timer. It will destroy batteries by the dozen. Avoid this product.
2,NOT LOUD,"I purchased this timer because it's supposed to be 'loud' - I have a two story home and my old alarm could be heard easily when I was upstairs. Not so with this one. It is not loud...it also will beep for a short period of time then turns off! I'll use it, but maybe have to stick it in my pocket so I'll be able to hear the alarm when it goes off! My search continues!"
5,My Favorite. Excellent.,"I own several timers and this is my favorite. The numbers are large and easy to read without my glasses. The end-of-time beeps are loud enough to hear in another room, even outside the open back door. The timer counts up while sounding end-of-time so I know how long it's been. It resets to the last time used and is easy and quick to reset. Highly recommended."
2,Alarm Barely Audible,"I suspect that the reviewers who said this timer's alarm was loud enough were less than 40 years old. For me, a 67-year-old, with the standard high-frequency hearing loss, not only was this alarm not NEARLY loud enough, but it is about the same frequency as my tinnitus! Nice big buttons and read-out, but it is going back anyway."
3,Not very loud,"I bought this timer because the first feature listed was a loud alarm. Not so, in the unit that was sent to me. It seems to be well built and all the other features listed are true. I did not return it because it is much better than the West Bend timers I have purchased that fall apart after a short period of time and have a soft tinney alarm sound."
2,"Decent book, geared towards beginners who don't want to get too technical","The Good: I like the format of this book; lots of pictures and lots of very short sections to work through.The Bad: The problem I noticed is that it doesn't present a very technical look at C# like an Apress or Wrox book would do. But that's ok, I guess, since the Visual Quickstarts are made to get a beginner up and running quickly. The other part I found interesting is taht the book covered advanced subjects, such as Delegates, Events, Inheritance and Interfaces, without first taking a deep look at the UI components. For a beginner I think things would make much more sense when learned from UI down.The book is definitely geared towards beginners, but I would have a hard time recommending it to my beginner friends due to the short amount of coverage given to building ASP.NET UIs."
3,Great graphics & premise.... babysitting level broken,"I think the graphics & storyline in this game are great. I love everything about the Playmobil line, so it was nice to have the world come to life.My only problem with this game is the there seemed to be a glitch involving the babysitting scenario. Laura was supposed to get something for her baby sibling to stop it from crying. Well I got the item & the baby stopped crying, but Laura's mother kept repeating, ""They baby is still crying."" It wouldn't allow me to advance to the next scenario."
3,not perfect for a Mac,"I installed the 5-port USB card in my G5 Power Mac, and it worked immediately. It didn't need a special driver. For ease of installation I give it high marks.The big problem is that my Mac won't go to sleep if I leave a flash drive plugged into the card. The Mac gets stuck between awake and asleep, and there's no way to wake it besides powering it off and back on. This problem is not specific to the SIIG USB card. Most USB cards have the same problem on a Mac. Do a search for ""macintosh usb deep sleep problem"" for more info."
1,Waste of time and money,"Absolutely terrible. I could defecate on this thing and it would probably work better. I spent five hours trying to get it to work with many headaches and curses. I was thinking the whole time it was a problem with my PC. Finally, after trying everything humanly possible (including updating my BIOS) and calling my motherboard tech support, I realized it had to have been a hardware issue. I tried everything (including switching it to different PCI slots) and everyone I asked was just as stumped as I was. Online knowledge base had nothing specific enough to even remotely help me and this company provides NO PHONE TECH SUPPORT, which is an automatic sign to me that the company is crud. I'm returning this piece of junk and getting an IOGEAR instead."
4,A classic reminder of the Soviet system,"As in his more famous ""Life and Fate,"" Grossman does a brilliant job getting into the minds of a variety of Soviet characters who are forced to deal with Stalin's brutal system and its aftermath. It is enlightening for those of us in the West to realize that, unlike the Germans after the fall of Hitler, the Russian people never had ""closure"" with their even bloodier past. Grossman shows us the thinking, not only of the released prisoners of the gulag, but the soul-searching of the men and women who denounced them or who merely stood by."
4,trees make good houses,"They've always had this great sound going for them, but they really find a voice on this album and bring the songs into sharper focus.Where the debut had a few songs which seemed trite and by-the-numbers (i.e. ""Kicks in the Schoolyard""), and the preceding E.P. was a little blurry for all it's sonic payoff, ""Birds Make Good Neighbors"" gels extremely well as a whole. The songs feel carefully crafted and recorded yet still come on like a sugar rush."
3,Only if you want to Show,"This book is an excellent reference book to anyone who wants to learn about the history of the PWD and how to show and breed. I adopted a PWD from a pound and know nothing of the breed before we got Cheech. I am glad this book was there to give my a general backround and some tips, however, I still would like to know more."
3,"Good book to have, but...","lots of show-dog filler. If you have your PWD as a regular, fun pet & not as a showdog, there are many pages in this book you will just be skimming over."
5,Personal Inspirations,"I had been looking for this cd for a while. I had one about 8 years ago and it was stolen from me. I am in a cd club, but could not find it in my search. I am very satisifed with my cd."
1,Dull,"This magazine seems to be all advertising. The articles written about places to visit are obviously written by people getting kickbacks from resorts, hotels and airlines, something we all wish we could get.Who can afford a hotel room for $2000 a night???Skip this magazine, the articles are dull, uninspiring and completely unrealistic to the average person.Try Frommers ""Budget Travel"" magazine instead. Much better!"
1,Bad folks. Liars. Don't fall for it.,"Needed the item by the weekend. Traded email with them on a tuesday - they said if I ordered a DIFFERENT Item, i'd get it shipped immediately. So I did. Saturday comes...nothing is here. email them""sorry, shipping is 2 to 7 days, please be patient""In other words they talked me into buying a different product KNOWING I wouldn't have it when I needed it by. Its shipped FROM CHINA.Don't beleive these great reviews, these people are bad bad bad."
4,Not a mystery at all..but still good,"If you picked up this book expecting a good mystery like The Rosary Murders, you will be greatly disappointed. However, if you're interested in a pretty decent character study of 4 young people preparing to enter the religious life, then you might enjoy it. In the last 10-12 years, Kienzle really hasn't written mysteries but rather character studies set against a Catholic background. Taken on that level, this is one of his best in the last few years."
3,"Very, very good adventure game","I don't play many games, but this one intrigued me - it had an interesting story, excellent graphics, and incredible cut-sequences. I'm not too far into it yet, but so far the story and the main interface is immersive.The main problem with this game is in it's ""alternate"" user interfaces, for the game actually has four modes: adventure, fighting, shooting and swimming. An somewhat uneasy transition takes you from one mode to another. Shooting mode is a traditional first-person shooter; however, it's one of the worst I've ever seen. It's fortunate you don't have to spend much time in this mode. Adventure and fighting modes are adequate; not the best I've seen, but they don't detract from the excellent story.Overall, I'd recommend this game."
4,A book to read if you are new to the Southeast.,I enjoyed Praying for Sheetrock very much. We are new to the Southeast. McIntosh County in Georgia is just north of us. On the tours and walks we have taken of this area we would hear you need to read Praying for Sheetrock. After reading you understood more about the County and its residents. I believe it is a book that everyone should read if they live along the coast of GA.
3,tried but could not finish,This story did not grab me. It seemed to wander and I gave up.sorryI did love the authors book.. 'without you there is no me' 5 stars for that
1,Never belive everything you read.,"Never belive everything you read unless you lived it. I wish I had a dollar for every different opion of how things were in McIntosh county in the 1970's. Anyone can write an opion but that is what it is ""an opion"" nothing more nothing less. People have a lot easier time beliving the bad things about people than than the good. Someone might go to McIntosh county and ask around about the late Sheriff. Opions will vary. Maybe each person who lived in McIntosh county during these ""bad times' should write a book. I live in McIntosh county and although I was very young during this era I have a hard time beliving all the Bull in this book. If you read it wear hip boots because belive it or not as the pages turn the Bull rises."
1,Kaurismaki's masterpiece,"This movie excels with unconventional attributes unseen in Hollywood movies these days - superb acting, true, honest characters without glamour, attention to minute detail in screenplay, sets and careful selection of music. This is what real movies are all about."
2,Lowlifes on the low key,"Plusses: interesting faces; quiet, caring interactions between characters; nice music when present; warm take on the Helsinki underbelly in summer.Minuses: predictable situation comedy, artificial plot with little symbolic saving grace, incompetently staged revenge scene, unsuccessful attempts at imitating David Lynch's style, persistent doubts that the film's losers could survive a Finnish winter.Give it a try, considering that others like it, but don't be surprised if you're disappointed."
4,salvation army in finland,"This film illustrates what I love best about being half finnish myself. Life in Finland is slow, people are taciturn and barely able to communicate. This shows the difference of Finland from the rest of Western Society - AND Eastern society. I think the music shows the minor key tone of living in the Northern climate, where the brain slows down to a crawl and survival means staying warm and dry against the odds. Knowing Finns as I have, I can understand why this movie is funny to them. Life plays out slowly and on a wave of timing that is unique. But they still manage to do the right thing - work, take care of each other and even fall in love."
3,Not what I expected,"The color says it is Chocolate? It is more like tan. It also says that it is machine wash on cold gentle cycle? Mine has tag that says ""DRY CLEAN ONLY"" If I had know I would not have ordered it. It is too much of a hassle to return it now."
5,A comprehensive introduction to Plato,"This collection of essays written by a host of outstanding scholars of ancient philosophy in this generation may well serve as a comprehensive and dense guideline to the philosophy of Plato and the contemporary viewpoints concerning the arguments presented by Plato. I am especially impressed by the excellent introduction written by the editor of this book, Richard Kraut. It is so well-organized, sharply presented and teemed with useful materials that I find it to be the best short introduction on Plato I ever read. And the structure of the whole book is also well balanced that the essays of which it is composed nearly touch every controverisal problems concerning Plato's philosophy and that those problems are all more or less treated in a appreciable way."
1,"Skip this one, buy a different Elmo","My two year old loves Elmo BUT this story is a dud. This is a joyless production with none of the zip, humor and heart foundin many other Sesame Street videos and DVD's. The songs are just not good - Charles Durning mumbles a boring little number and Harvey Fierstein's ""musical"" number seems as if it was written five minutes before taping. Their is just no quality to any of this. The rest of the characters on Sesame Street becomes depressed because every day is Christmas and they cannot get on with the lives. I'm afraid their feelings are contagious. Buy Elmo in Grouchland - lots of story, good songs, humor and very cute."
4,good when i was little,I loved this movie! when I was up to 7 now Im ten and it warms my heart seeing other kids watching it.And now I can say I hope tey are enjoying it i sure did!
2,Xmas every day? Does this movie ever end?,"Although some of the classic Sesame Street sytle is here, this is way too long leaving the viewer wondering if this tedious story will ever end..and a grumpy Santa to boot! What my kids remember most? That Elmo shatters his snowglobe(no I'm not giving away the story.) Now, every single snowglobe that has entered our home in 3 years gets the ""wish,wish'wish"" and thrown on the pavement treatment. We just got Tim Allen's Santa Clause. Pick that over this! The magic is real and the plot keeps moving at a wonderful pace. Humor far excels Sesame Street's also. If you liked Elmo in Grouchland, you'll probably like Elmo Saves Christmas. We didn't like either."
2,My Son Won't Watch it.,"I purchased this movie for my 2 year old son after finding out that he loves the movie ""Elmo's Christmas Countdown"". I was hoping for the same result with this movie, but was disappointed to realize that he does not like this movie at all. He sits through small parts of it here and there but has only watched about 10% even though I've played it in full at least 6 times. I'm not surprised because this movie takes place on the set of ""Sesame Street"" which he also doesn't really like to watch."
5,Love it!,I love this movie. It is a great one to watch with young children during the Christmas season. Shipped on time.
1,TRASH,"Before a year in my car, the low tone went damage, this product really sucks... don't buy it. It's from India, not a real German made product. DON'T BUY IT!!!:("
5,If you like Coldplay. This Is For You,I love Coldplay. And now I love Embrace. Wow. That's about all I can say. This cd is very much in the same vein as Coldplay but a little more rock. The songs are amazingly catchy.I stumbled upon this and I can guarantee you I will be getting their other cd's. Do yourself a favor and pick this up now.
1,I Hate This Kind of Music,"I heard a song by this band at a cafe and someone said it was by ""Embrace."" I don't know the name of the song I heard that day, but it sure ain't on this CD. I hate the kind of music that's on this CD. Apparently they have a huge following in the UK, so don't pay too much attention to my opinion. Some people must love it. But I HATED it."
4,Now Watch Me Rise Up and Leave,"I was first introduced to Embrace by some one who compared them to Coldplay. Aside from being British and mellow, emotional music, there really isn't much in common musically aside from Gravity that takes off the signature Coldplay guitar crunch (and coincidently was co-written by Chris Martin). With the multiple layered music and danceable tracks, The Stone Roses might be a better comparison.On their latest album, Out of Nothing, Embrace shine whenever they go for the layered vocals/choral approach to songs such as Ashes and Someday. The added layers give a sense of grandeur that seem to be missing from today's pop landscape. The slower songs, such as the title track, do bring down the album a little bit as they don't pull these types of songs off like Coldplay. Luckily, most of these songs do change tempos to make the songs better.Best Song - Ashes"
5,Excellent uplifting music,This album starts with an upbeat uplifting song which grabs your attention very quickly.. and doesnt let go after that. The lyrical style of the lead vocalist creates an album with a very positive feel and is highly recommended.
2,experimental failure,"Every dj experiments with new sounds and styles. But for a true UK trance DJ....pop??? Oakenfold breaks loose of the traditional trance euphoria previously released in such titles as 'tranceport' or the 007 global underground series, and takes on a new twist. Mixing wack beats with funky lyrics, he manages to spit out a new sound, but I didnt go for it. I would reccomend anyone to pass on this item. If youre looking to hear some of oakenfolds best stuff, I'd reccomend 'Planet Perfect presents another world.'"
4,"Not the best ever, but a great album nonetheless!","I normally don't write reviews, but after that crazy angry kid dissed this very good oakey album, I had to share my opinion of it. This cd is very eclectic, which I personally don't have a problem with. Maybe for a small minded person this is an issue? I also think comparing BT and Oakenfold is idiotic. They have completely different (and very good) styles. People that are more into traditional vocal trance will adore Southern Sun and Hold Your Hand. Southern Sun has been stuck in my head ever since I bought Bunnka. Its similar to Chicane's Autumn Tactics, another absolutely gorgeous song. Anyway, buy it, you won't regret it, I know I don't!"
4,No Trance but still good old Oakenfold,"Oakenfold made a name for himself through the trance world and did it incredibly well. He is the man when it comes too ""trance"" music. Him and John Digweed rule that buisness. Now, Oakenfold has branched off into his own music and its incredible. There is no more trance on ""Bunkka"" but it is an insane, cocaine-driven ride that makes u just want to close your eyes, get some water, and lean back and just enjoy. This cd is a must own for the Paul Oakenfold fans. The only reason why i had to give this is a four star review is because there is no trance which is a disappointment but he brings up the hopes to higher expectations than what you could ever think of. Paul Oakenfold has done it again. Enjoy."
1,I was quite disappointed when I heard this Cd.,"Paul Oakenfold, thought to be one of the best DJs in the world. I didn't have to think twice about buying this cd. When I heard all of the cameos on this cd, I was very mad, (I edited that). I listened to the first track, it was not what I was expecting, when the track switched to the next song, I was confused, I thought where is the mixing? Then I heard the rest of the cd and realized that I had been scammed by Paul Oakenfold. Over time he had impressed me by making flawless cds in the past, then I heard this disgusting waste of plastic and I doubted his mental state. As an avid Oakenfold fan, and a fan of good music I suggest not listening or buying this cd. Even though I'm not from England or Europe, I still know what good trance music is, and this is definately not one of those cds."
3,Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot???,"WTF?Why is it that of all Paul Oakenfold CDs released, this is the only one I loathe? Granted, there are some noteworthy songs here (I thoroughly enjoyed [Ready Steady GO], [Zoo York], and [Hypnotised]), in all the Cd leaves more to be desired. [Southern Sun] I can only stand in small doses, [Time of your life] is decent at best, and [Starry-eyed Surprise] is more pop and less dance. [Get em up]was a nice song to begin with, so it would be pretty hard to mess up its remix. [Hold your hand] is aiight in small doses, But everything else on this CD just SUX!!!!And Nelly Furtado/Tricky's song [The Harder they come]really disappointed me.In all, this CD is Average at best."
5,Creative and Absorbing,"Oakenfold's ""Bunkka"" is an great blend of musical styles and it features a great array of vocalists from Perry Farrell to Ice Cube among others. Many of the tracks here are trance in nature and may not appeal to those who prefer a harder beat, but each has a flavor its own. Overall, Bunkka is a strong and original CD and worth the money!"
1,"Pathetic attempt at a ""Movie""","Wow. I've seen better 10 minute videos on You Tube. The dialogue via subtitles are from a high school play. It's almost a parody of some very bad sci-fi movies. Below-amateur writing, production, directing and editing. I watched it twice with theatre and then movie production people. We all had a wonderful time- CHORTLE! SNEER! GUFFAW! SNICKER! Even Ernie Fosselius' ""Hardware Wars"" was superior to this tripe. Serious students of film will barf at 19.25 minutes.On my list of ""The 100 Worst Films I've Ever Seen."" This is one of those DVD's that you can use as a signaling mirror if you're lost on a deserted island."
4,Good fun...but don't think too hard.,"I felt a need to provide a counterbalance to the previous (2 star) review. If you recognize the limited resources used in this movie (five actors...total!....and what had to be a VERY low budget) I think you can appreciate how much they accomplished in spite of their limits. Very few movies involving time travel ever make sense when viewed en toto, but that doesn't stop them from being an enjoyable ride (Donny Darko, anyone?). Reminiscent of the books ""The Man Who Folded Himself"" by David Gerrold or ""Croyd"" by Ian Wallace, the movie ""Timecrimes"" repeatedly folds back on itself until the viewer is lost in an Escheresque mobius strip of events. But in this case think too hard and you kill the goose. I enjoyed it very much...but don't ask me to explain it!"
1,Not sure about the movie but quality was really bad.,"I wanted to try this service for the first time and this movie was hard to come by anywhere else so I was happy to find it on Amazon. But the quality was pretty poor, not sure if this is how the service is in general.Also it was dubbed to English from Spanish as oppose to being subtitled and that I can't really sit through. It would have been nice if that was communicated before I rented this cause I would have never spent the money on such junk.I still want to see the movie. Hopefully I'll find it somewhere."
2,Nothing spectacular,I was pretty disappointed with this book - I had the murderer picked in the first 50 pages and found the overall story to be extremely predictable. I thought the characters were too simple; the good were very good and the bad very bad. There was very little depth or complexity to the characters or plot. This was the first Nora Roberts book I've read and it will be the last.
3,Last few pages ruined story.,"All the way through, the book was really good. I LOVE the name Kincade Lavelle. And I really liked all of the characters, especially Faith. There always seem to be great secondary characters in Roberts' books (Like Farley in Black Hills). The plot was good and so was the romance. I was very satisifed as the very end of the book neared.But in the last few pages, when you find out who the REAL murdering creep was, it ruined everything. when the identity of Hope's real murderer is tossed at you in like the last four pages, it isn't clever, it isn't good. This overall good story was ruined and left me very disappointed. There were no good clues leading up to make you believe he really was the killer. Roberts just kind of put him there, I suppose as like a final twist. Well, it stunk because it's unbelievable. Not even a spectacular kind of unbelievable, it was stupid. Completely stupid."
3,Call me a wimp but...,"I love Roberts' humor and writing style BUT I don't like to read books, particularly romance, that contain scenes of child abuse or sexual perversion. The graphic rating on these is not as high as her work as Robb but it's NOT her ""Born in"" series either. Please, can this type of book come with a warning label? Sort of like a the parental advisory found on CDs. If I want to read a description of how a child screams while being beaten by father's belt or how many times a rape victim gets smacked about, I'll start reading the horror stories in a big city paper."
4,Sometimes you can go home again,"Tory Bodeen was beaten by her father who said she was evil because she could feel and see things that 'normal' people couldn't. But Hope was her friend and she coped until Hope was murdered and Tory 'saw' the whole thing happen as she recovered from another beating. No one believed that she wasn't there with Hope and escaped while Hope was being murdered when she lead them to Hope's body the next morning.Years later Tory returns to her home town to open a gift shop and to reconcile herself to the loss of Hope. But many in the town can't forgive or forget including Hope's mother. However, Cade Lavelle, Hope's older brother, finds that Tory is what's been missing in his life. He refuses to let her shut him out even when someone seems to be trying to force Tory to leave or die.A good story, strong characters with believable motives. Even the supporting characters are interesting and multi-dimensional."
1,thumbs down!,"I was expecting this book to be very good because I know that Nora Roberts is a popular romance writer. ""Carolina Moon"" was the first book by her that I've read and my expectations were not at all met. It was extremely overdramatic and most of the time I would feel like rolling my eyes. The conversations were much too lengthy and didn't always reveal very much and the characters were too horny. They made it sound more like lust than love. The ending was pretty abrupt and also very unrealistic. DUMB. I'm not reading another Nora Roberts, especially after having read that most of her books are the same plot and characters over and over again."
3,Good up until the Scooby Doo ending,"I was enjoying this book and found it a good suspense read, however, I was a bit disappointed by the scooby-doo type ending. I won't ruin the ending for you readers. I'll just say Roberts pulled that out of thin air with no clues leading to it. You could never get to that conclusion based on the things she tells you throughout the book and she tries to wrap up the real ending in the last 5 pages (I could just hear the scooby group explaining the impossible to solve mystery in 2 minutes). I also feel the author left some loose ends (like between Margaret and Tory). It is a surprise ending, but aren't all mysteries supposed to be like that? This ending was just totally out of the reader's reach, came out of nowhere."
3,great book.. but,"I loved this book, the reason for the three stars is the very predictable ending. I've only read a few Nora Roberts books, and already its obvious that in most if not all, there is either an engagement or a wedding being planned. The thing that bothered me in this book is that the wedding is being planned only days after main character's mother dies. Their relationship was never very good, practically non-existent, but it still bothered me how it was almost brushed aside. Also, people change so fast in these books.Other than that, the book is very good, it grips you from page one and doesnt let go until the end. A real page turner."
3,An OK read,"Nora Roberts has always been one of my favorite authors,but lately it seems that she is not at her best. I used to look forward to her novels, but now I can take them or leave them. Although this book's villain was surprising, the ending was lackluster. I think Nora is putting her books out to fast and can't really get into the storyline or her characters like she used to. I hope that she gets her gift of talented writing back, before she loses a devoted reader."
5,Try GHOST MOON if you liked this!,"I just finished Karen Robard's GHOST MOON. I didn't even realize their names until I finished the book. What I liked about this one was Roberts goes into detail for every character, unlike Robard who only mentions the killer every once and a while. I loved both of them and if you liked this one try GHOST MOON. They both made me make sure my doors are locked!"
3,Carolina Moon,"""I killed her or was it an accident?"" Will Tory ever tell someone. The story is call Carolina Moon by Nora Roberts. Tory is now a grown women, but she feels that her friend Hope is going to hunt her for what Tory did accidentally or not 11 years ago. Now Faith, Hope's twin sister is trying to find out the truht. Cade, Faith's brother is falling in love with Tory, but will he ever find out that Tory was with Hope the night of her death? I recommend this book if you like mystery with realistic books."
2,Confusing photo,"The photo provided is very deceiving - it looks like you are getting 5 PACKS of bags. In fact you are receiving 5 individual bags. I was surprised to receive only five bags for the price charged - making them much more expensive than what I could purchase at a home improvement store or even the grocery store! Will not make that mistake again. The bags are high quality lawn bags, but I can buy the exact thing (and same number) for less than half price at the grocery store."
3,"Good heavy-duty bag, but 4.8x more expensive than Home Depot!","These are pretty standard heavy-duty yard bags. They stand up, are easy to fill, and heavy-duty enough that the bottom doesn't rip out. For that I give them 5 stars.However, you can get EXACTLY the same thing (with a different printed logo) at Home Depot for $1.88/5 pack! That's 4.8x more expensive! I've tried lawn bags from Fred Meyer, Ace, Home Depot, and Amazon. HD and Amazon are the thickest and heaviest - but what a price difference!I ordered these because I was being lazy and had not conducted a careful price comparison. If you don't live near a Home Depot, these are a quality product, but you can absolutely find much cheaper alternatives elsewhere."
1,Oster false advertised the batteries and their life...,"I've used oster clippers for years with various results. The best of their corded ""golden"" clippers get so hot that you burn an animal with the blade and the new fanned ones are no better. These new cordless clippers are the pits. The batteries don't have enough power and no life at all. They actually go dead on their own in a matter of weeks. So, when you get the urge to clip your pet you must first get the sweet little case out to find dead clipper batteries. So then go get the old plug-in variety, clip the dog and take some pictures by the time these expensive good for nothing ""professional"" clippers are ready to do something. Forget about it! The dealer told me to forget about warranty on the batteries too! And $44 to replace them? - forget about it! They will need to do something about the batteries but hold your hat for the price for that!!! Did I say: FORGET ABOUT IT?!!!!"
2,breaks easily...,"I agree with the reviewers who mention that it breaks easily. It broke about the second time that my son transformed it. He's 5 and not hard on toys. We managed to glue it so that it still transforms, but it definitely isn't the easiest/best quality of his Transformers."
4,A descriptive review,"This is my 3rd review so i'll make it good. The transformation is a bit frustrating because you'll think you have it all right until you notice a piece not just right. The reason I rated the educational value a 3 is because it will teach you some engineering skills.Now onto the body. The legs: one of the more difficult parts of the transformation.You have to pull some parts of them in some interesting positions.Not to terribily hard but a bit frustrating.The arms: The one thing I do not like is the arms get separated too easily.The cannon arm especally proves my point. Everything else is just fine.Jet mode: Now this is where the frustration kicks in. Like I said earlier, you just never seem to have it right. If you mess up here,whatever you do, do not throw it down on the floor and start screaming mad. Just do the best you can and leave it at that. The end"
2,"They work, but they are not quite IEEE standard","They are what they are - a bag of 100 RJ45 connectors that someone probably bought a volume purchase on and split them up into lots.These connectors work but they are not quite IEEE standard - plugging them into IEEE standard hardware (ie my CISCO router) doesn't produce that reassuring 'click' and they wiggle around in the slot slightly loose. I know it's not my equipment at fault because it's CISCO equipment and all of my branded cables click in fine.It still works, and I'm even using these at 1Gps so they are fine. But I'm guessing the are cheap ""copies of copies"" - someone has casted a remold from an existing RJ45 rather than using a reference spec connector.For home use it's fine but I wouldn't use these in a critical set up."
4,Good router,"I used the linksys wrt55ag for about a year, and finally got fed up with the constant drops, and problems with some vpns working with it. I tried netgears ag router, and it had problems with my vpn. This one worked great outta the box, no configuration issues, no vpn problems, no disconnects and good speed. Of the 3, its hands down the best."
5,Mandatory Study for Any Serious Chinese Medicine Herbalist,"This is the only really useful English language translation of the SHL, written by people with a command of both Classical Chinese and English. And if you study it you will find it immediately clinically useful, esp if you already have some experience.How many USA or for that matter Chinese, Japanese or Korean herbalists actually understand how to use Gui Zhi Tang?This book is the beginning of Chinese herbal medicine, in terms of what remains of classical texts, and as such should be part of the education in all the schools. Of course, sadly, it is not.I dont think the 1 star review on this page really even merits comment; the nicest thing one could say is its misguided; but foolish might be more accurate. Agree with all what the publisher in his review has to say."
4,great,I ordered the book for my wife who wanted to have a guide line for her work out and she loves it
3,"Fabric ""sheds"" and frays","Well, it certainly does the job as it is waterproof, however, just after one wash the fabric begins to, for lack of a better word, fray. I would not purchase this product again."
2,I Just Don't Get It...,"I have never understood the fascination so many have for this show, I've seen it performed, watched the DVD, and have the C.D. I've spent hours trying to figure out why someone would call this ""good musical theatre."" I have seen more than 20 Broadway shows, own hundreds of musicals on CD and DVD.I have tried to really like this musical but, it's over dramatized, stupid, and lacks EVERYTHING someone would want from a musical. The characters are slow, stupid, there are a few comic moments but not enough to make the story a thought provoking jounrey. I haven't found a song yet on this CD that I truly enjoy.""No One Is Alone"" somehow manages to stand out but that's the only song I would listen to more than once. All in all I'd consider listening to a differant Sondheim classic for this is just simply not his best..."
1,AWFUL!,"If you are interested in listening to Sondheim's wonderful musical Into the Woods, DONT NOT BUY THIS CD. Bernadette Peters ia far more animated and charismatic as the witch (in the original broadway cast recording) with Vanessa Williams in the revival recording seriously lacking. Also, Jack's mother has no rhythm, and the other parts are so far behind the spotless caliber of the original cast. This cd is a waste of your money. Invest in the original."
2,Bernedette Is Better!!,"""Into The Woods"" is a nice show. Bernedette Peters is a much better performer and is a better Witch than Vanesssa Williams, but the supporting characters (Jack, Little Red, Wolf) aren't on the original CD. Jack is basically the same on both CDs. Little Red is less annoying in the revival (YESSS!) and the Wolf is funnier in the revival.The worst performer is Jack's mom. She sounds like Julie Andrews after her vocal tragedy. I think the orginal is funnier, has gusto and does justice to the role. The new mom is discracefull.I didn't care for the narator. I thought he sounded too soft and not old and baggy in ""No More.""I did enjoy Laura Bennenti more than the orginal. But no one can be better than Joanna Gleason as the Baker's Wife. She is the tops and the new one isn't.In all, buy the Original CD! Not this CD!"
3,"Not bad, but far from good.","The revival on Broadway was actually excellent. The sets alone made up for the lackluster cast, which is what you'll hear in this recording. The essential voices are just not there. Vanessa is good, but Jack completely tramples on his beautiful song. After hearing Malcolm Gets (check out Barbara Cook Sings Mostly Sondheim) sing the Jack song, it would be very difficult to find anyone who can even come close to that stunning performance. All in all, this album is not worth getting just for Vanessa, she's terrific, but she's not as playful and piercing as Bernadette."
4,"Into the woods and out of the woods, a great ride!","I think this revival Broadway show is excellent. It is amazing! Unforgettable! The new version of the CD is also overwhelming fantastic.I think the little riding hood played by Molly Ephraim was great, just as innoncent as she can be. My favourite, Jack, the sad young lad played by Adam Wylie was a bravo, his voice really fitted how I imagined Jack to be. All the casts are great, but Vanessa Williams didn't do as well as I expected. She's got an excellent voice, but her role (the witch) was a bit distracting, considering the witch is evil and she didn't really bring out that sense of villian...only she looked a bit silly. She still did a great job in the singing, but her acting throughout the show was not as great as her voice.Overall, the show is excellent and the music is awesome, no doubt you'll forget the ending of ""Ever After""."
5,Maybe I just prefer revival recordings..,"I quickly went out and bought this recording after I was upset with myself for missing the show's run here in L.A. I hated myself even more after listening to it. Wonderful orchestrations and the cast is incredible. It's as if this recording manages to express more of the character's traits and personalities. We can read more into what type of people they are throughout the show, without having to see them acting it out on a stage. Vanessa Williams really is terrific. Sondheim just keeps getting better!"
5,"Raptor's Prey ""The heartaches of War""","This was a very profound telling of what the War of vietnam was like for the people who were in country and what they went through, there are some very humerous parts that everyone who has served in the military can share in some of those experiences. Having served on Destroyers and Aircraft carriers and Major Relay Communication ships doing tours during vietnam, nothing like the heartaches that the grunts endured. This book is very compelling and should be read by everyone as it will help appreciate the need for people to realize the problems caused by war. This was a superb book, dedicated to the authors fellow comrades and is a complement to the author. well done"
5,Not a toy but for model builders only,"Although this is in the toy category, it is not a toy for children but for serious model builders. I do not recommend it for children."
3,Gerald,I have always enjoyed listening to Gerald. I am very glad that he recorded this CD before his passing and I just love My Song
5,Concerning the Heritage Press Edition of 1950,"Heritage/LEC had a lot of fun in developing an intelligent, dignified, and yet evocative design for de Quincey's classic.A bilious, swirling variation of marbled paper appears on the book and the slipcover (is opium green?) Book is bound with severe black cloth at the spine. Red page edges, 2 color type throughout and 12 full-page Gay gravures."
2,Smells cheap!,"Its not what I expected, it smells like cheap 5 dollar perfume, dont waste your money on this one, its not worth it...Just not a pleasant scent"
3,Title...,"Fix the title Amazon, so the game can be searched for. I not trying to be overly picky, but that was really annoying..."
5,Great Album,"I can't imagine anyone perfecting the 'super chorus' more than Killswitch Engage has done with this album. While I agree with the sentiments of some other reviewers when they say they were hoping for more of an evolution than a continuation in sound - after a few listens of Daylight Dies I'm not complaining at all.This album rocks - every song a near-perfect blend of aggression and that 'melodic power' KSE has become famous for.Yes, I wish there were more solos, more complex arrangements, etc. But the album is so good those gripes are easy to overlook.Very well done, and worth picking up for sure. I do hope their next release is something new and different - I can't see how they can do this type of sound any better."
2,lost something along the way,"Im sorry if this pisses off rabid KsE fans but these guys just lost it after they lost Jesse Leach. In many ways this sounds exactly the same as the previous disc. I think they reached a pinnacle with Alive or Just Breathing and have not surpassed it since. Although there are some hints of progression and maturity I must say overall the disc fails to hold my interest,probably because in spite of itself the ""metalcore"" scene finds itself oversaturated with bands that all sound the same. Ive seen some defenite and dramatic changes with certain bands as they released newer material,Dry Kill Logic and Chimaera immediately come to mind. But unfortunately,this one just doesnt do it for me. Dont get me wrong,it doesnt suck,but Ive been a metalhead now since the 80's and its going to take a bit more than a few subtle time changes and some more mature chord progressions to impress me. Check out the new In Flames,The Haunted,Children of Bodom."
3,KIllswitch Disengaged,"I picked up this album with optimism that KsE would deliver once again as they always have in the past. Whether it be ""Alive or Just Breathing"" with the raw energy of a young KsE or ""The End of Heartache"" with the emotionally driven metalcore that has since become KsE...the beauty and energy was always there. That being said, ""As Daylight Dies"" was an inevitable turn for KsE. The Energy is gone, the beauty is gone and the only reason I'm going this three stars is because of the songs ""My Curse"" and ""The Arms Of Sorrow."" Other than those two songs, this album lacks everything that the last two definitely had. I even found myself laughing at this effort thinking that they cannot be serious with songs such as ""Break The Silence."" If you want good metalcore then go pick up KsE's ""Alive or Just Breathing."" Don't waste your time with this release."
2,It Died Alright,"Well to start off, I first got into KsE when I saw them co-headline with In Flames back on their Touring for your Escape tour (so the End of Heartache had just been released), and thought they were awesome live so I picked up their album and was disappointed from the beginning. Awesome riffs here and there but the lack of solos was beyond disappointing as were the singers vox.This album falls into a lot of the same pit falls the last one had, decent guitar work, decent screaming, energy abundant, but without solos I find this record to be a failure. Nothing new here, unless your a die hard fan then you have some new songs. But if you weren't a fan before, this won't change your mind nor should it. Should you need to give a KsE album a try, may I recommend ""Alive or Just Breathing"" over this. But ultimately, the -core fan that I am, go grab any Darkest Hour, Heaven Shall Burn, or Unearth record instead."
2,KsE doing what they do best . . . again,"As Daylight Dies, or Killswitch Engage vol 4 as I like to call it, is everything you'd expect it to be, which is why it's so disappointing.The KsE secret formula:1)Pounding Guitar/Bass work2)Angry growling3)One anthemic, big voiced chorus4)Alternating scream/sing patters in the third verseKsE are one of the most capable metal bands around, but this never ending rehash of formula and material is getting old. I knew what this record was going to sound like, minute for minute, before I even bought it.Change is the only constant, unless you're killswitch engage, and that is why I can't recommend As Daylight Dies."
1,This is perhaps the most boaring book I have ever read.,"I had to read this book for school. The story that is there is good, but way too discriptive. It would have made a good short story, not a loooooong novel. The whole first page is about a cloud of smoke. This book is incredibly overrated. Anyone who wants to read this book, don't. Read Where the Red Fern Grows instead. It has the same theme/moral/whatever, is much more exciting, and dosen't drag you kicking and screaming through page after page of describing pansies and trees."
1,Cruel people,"Boring, slow and v hard to read! Hunting, hunting, hunting..... killing animals and again killing. I bothers me a lot!!!"
1,Not a point to the whole book. WASTE OF TIME,"I really hated this book. The first half of the book has no point and the second has no point either. I would not reccomend this book to anyone. In the book, the boy talks like a hic and they are extremely uncivilized for 1920. They had electric guitars back then!!!"
2,"Slow, but a good moral",I think that this book is very slow and confusing. I am being forced to read this in the 7th grade. I guess it has a good moral of getting through a lot of hard choices in life and I wouldn't recomend this to many people.
3,Used to be great....,"I love sardines, and I believe that the best sardines are the one from Portugal....but the one from Spain are pretty close. I bought these before, when they were made in Spain. Not anymore, now are made in Morocco, but of inferior quality compared to Season's... Definitely a big drop in quality, the flavor is different...This purchase was the last one, I will not buy them again."
5,Mind energizing,"This book set me on the road to becoming an engineer - ME, 1958. It was an exciting and mind blowing revelation on what was possible."
3,a decent phone for its price,this phone is better than the older V3 motorola phone. It has a much better screen resolution and responds faster. But the interface takes a little time and effort to get used to. But on the whole decent phone for its price.
1,not what I ordered,"I received the tabletop only with no base to attach it to. Also, the tabletop is white with red bird instead of red with red bird as advertised on the website. Bad deal!"
5,Gives great ideas for how to keep a class efficient,"This book is one of the most informative books that I have read addressing how to keep a class on track. It gives ideas for class interaction, homework, quizzes, group work, and others. I have found his ideas very helpful, this being my first year of teaching. There are also two more books that follow."
1,One of the WORST Assassination Books Ever...,"The only reason this book rates 'one star' is because the option of 'zero stars' is not available.This book has to be one of the all-time worst books written about the assassination, right up there with the likes of 'Case Closed' and 'Final Disclosure.'Like 'Case Closed,' Hartwright's book is full of lies, deception, and misinformation.In addition, it is poorly written and contains multiple grammatical errors.The book also engages in bashing of liberals, homosexuals, Jews, Israel, and President Lyndon Johnson, just to name a few.Hartwright contends that Oswald supposedly acquired a high-tech 'exploding' bullet and intentionally loaded it as his third cartridge out of four. Any experienced assassination researcher would realize how ridiculous that theory is.Don't waste your hard-earned money on this volume of trash..."
4,Nicely Updated,"I like most of the updates to office. Not thrilled with the ""tabs"" but got used to them."
4,MS Office Small Business 2007 Full Version,"I love the MS office products, although upgrading to the 2007 version was easy, I am finding the learning curve for the newer versions a bit more cumbersome than I'd expected. So be ready to do things a little different and keep your owners manual or your help button at the ready. I found it easier to just look for help than to try to figure it out on my own."
1,fooled on Microsoft Office Prof,I was under the impression I was to receive a full version of Office Prof 2000 instead I got a key number that has to be used with a new computer that is not over 90 days old. I have an old Windows vista that had the trial verson but the computer was purchased at Sam's as the display so it was over 90 days old. I spent right at 200 dollars on a key number I can not use. I have emailed the company and I have not gotten a response as yet 5 weeks now. My husband bought a laptop 6 months ago but never tried to use the office and I tried to use the key on it with no luck so I guess I am out 200 dollars that sucks. The company needs to say it is for OEM (new computers) before they sell it to people that do not know what OEM means.
4,as advertised,"Perfectly compatible with my 8820. It's even got icons on the mute and power buttons. Hard to beat the price and quality.It does tend to slip open partially during removal from pockets, but it's not a deal breaker for me."
4,pleased,got this for a friend. It was good quality and did the job it was suppose to do. if you need better protection buy otterbox
2,Worked great for a while then the handle broke clean off.,I used it to make fresh salsa for most of the summer. The handle kept cracking more and more after every use until eventually the handle broke off.I will be looking for something a little strong next time I guess.
3,Doesn't work on Windows 2000,"Be careful, it looks AWESOME ON WINDOWS 98, BUT doens't install with Windows 2000. I had to return it, but my friend loves it becuase he has Windows 98 and it runs great."
5,Excellent tool at the right price,"I use this refractometer for hard apple cider and wine making. Very simple to use, pretty accurate (don't expect to be able to read to the tenth of a Brix) and comes in a good box convenient to carry and protect the device.Highly recommended for the price."
2,repetetive,"very little variety in housing styles, they are all modern boxes. i agree with someone who wrote that this is a coffee table book. i.e. not useful for much except flipping through the pictures when you're bored."
1,save your money,Empty square boxes; cold and modern. The flat roofs would never work in the northern climate.
2,Ehh? Could be bigger.,"I am a minimalist to the fullest, but this book simply lacks depth. The ""blueprints"" are hardly viewable, let alone descriptive. Most of the structures resemble eachother and are spare, without furnishings or signs of life. I would recommend the book, ""PREFAB"" by Allison Arieff for bigger pictures, broader concepts and more in depth explanations. I suppose they were making a point by making the size of the book compact, but the few times I was impressed with a structure I would scour the three or so pages devoted to it and then it was over, leaving me wanting much more. Try classics like, ""Pierre Koenig"", by James Steele or ""Julius Shulman: Architecture and Its Photography"" by Peter Gossel. Ta Ta"
1,box of dirt and pack of nothing,"well, kitty didn't get any catnip. followed directions and i still have a container of dirt. first amazon ordered product that was not what was advertised. what a shame. poor kitty."
1,Worst Amp and Service EVER,"I would've given no stars but apparently that isn't an option. I bought this amp a few months ago, and it performed adequate, so I figured I would keep it instead of pony up more dough to get another one. And then randomly it stopped working. After two months of usage I could no longer turn my stereo on loud enough to hear it. It would continually shut off. So I asked to return it, and they complied, and now that I have shipped it back to them, I am only getting a partial refund. This is a joke. I would never buy any electrical equipment from this seller ever!"
1,I would have enjoyed it ........ if i was three years old,"I was extremely dissapointed with this game it's an unrealistic game with situations that are dumber than hiting a real hornets nest with a stick. It is to easy at the begining but then to hard 75% into the game I'm still stuck in Columbia mission 8. (I mean landing on occupied enemy airbase, come on!) The way you are 40 times stronger than the other jets with un realistic weapon effects (ie Destroying a building with guns) will leave dedicated flight sim players so dissapointed they'll cry. If your going to buy a flight sim buy Falcon 4.0 and dont buy Top Gun. (Trust me)"
2,Subpar,"One cup of coffee away from a psycho ward or one cigarette puff short of nuclear meltdown, James Woods is always a fascinating study for an audience that thrives on the unpredictable. This movie could have used more of his patented bug-eyed nuttiness. As it stands, Woods plays the role of unconventional cop in pretty conventional fashion, which, coupled with a murky, uninvolving script and slack direction, amounts to subpar and generally uninteresting slasher fare. There are moments of genuine quirkiness, as when he seemingly ad-libs a cynical remark suggesting that sex rather than sensitivity is what motivates his interest in Lesley Ann Warren. But those moments are few and far between, and I suspect this film went from production directly to video release without a commercial run. Woods should give up the lover-boy fling and stick to his specialty--being the edgiest guy in Hollywood. That should be enough for anyone."
3,Just get it at Home Depot,"Item arrived as advertised, except the extra flints. Next time I buy it locally so I don't have to worry about incompetent workers packaging products without all the items."
4,Read Product Features,"It says right in the product features: ""Does not include extra flints"", for all you people saying ""product not as advertised."" You should read what your getting before ordering. Don't go by a picture."
4,Great Service!,I ordered this for an iMac G4. The memory I received worked well for a week and then had some problems.I shipped it back to the vendor for a replacement without any hassles. The new memory is flawless!Thanks go to the seller CalvinNHobbs from a satisfied customer!!
5,I gave this as a gift..,I gave this to my older sister and she really LOVED it. I thought it was a really great idea. she hasn't used them yet but when she does i will defiantly up date this review
4,Treasure those hands,"I received the first set as a baby shower gift for my boy - some 5 years ago now. Bought a second one for my second son - one year left to do. Grandma jumped right in and bought this for my daughter who is turning one soon. The process is simple enough. I did find at first it took several tries to get the consistency correct, but was easy enough to fix. The biggest challenge came with getting the toddlers to coorperate... found those couple of years, with some help, naptime was a good time to make the handprints. My boys would sleep right through the ""procedure""..."
4,"Very cute, but don't follow the package instructions!","This product worked well for me, however the directions that come with the tin are wrong. It says to add 1/4 cup of water and stir for the first tin. It should say add 1/8 cup water and stir! The first tin is so tiny, 1/4 cup of water turns the plaster into soup! I ended up having to take some plaster powder from the 2nd year tin in order to get it the right consistency! The finished product turned out well though and overall I'm happy with it.A tip: Wipe some Pam cooking spray on your child's hand before pressing it into the plaster. It really helps!!Good luck!"
3,Good quality but wrong color,"This box is well made and a good size. However, the color is very different in person than online. The box is very red, more like a cherry finish. I had to return it since it didn't match anything. If you don't mind the red color, it is a great desk tray."
3,Wood working could be better...,"This could be a better product if the maker paid a little more attention to the finish quality of the wood. The box looks to be oak with a mahogany finish, and is indeed reddish. It looks nice from a distance, but the edges and saw cuts are quite rough. There was quite a lot of grain tear-out around the semicircular cut-out on the front of the box. The edges appear not to have been planed or sanded at all, exhibiting obvious grooving from the saw.However, the joinery is accurate, and the parts fit together well. The bottom of the box is covered with felt, which is a nice feature. The box has a solid and sturdy feel, and the finish is shiny and looks like it will be durable.So, highly functional, but could benefit from a more critical eye regarding the woodworking."
1,Nothing trickle about it,"I purchased this because I thought it was a trickle charger, instead I find it needs to be monitored. The name is mis-leading, I returned it."
3,not quite ready for the big leagues,"i like this thing. it does exactly what it says it can do. but it's not ready for automobile batteries, particularly if you are trying to raise the dead. i don't know what 1 amp looks like, but it's not much."
1,Red Top or red meat?,"I mix Met-Rx Plus with regular flavored rice milk in my blender and pour it on my cereal with if I can get them, fresh red currants and rasberries. I like this product because it also gives me a great amount of calcium.Since red meat is said to be a good source of protein, I don't have to eat so much meat to get the protein for my weight training workouts. I also have the chocolate powder for my evening meals. Except fo the hassle of washing my blender twice a day, I think I'll continue drinking Met-Rx."
2,Picture It! Publishing Platinum 2002,"This program has been a big disappointment to me. I have Picture It 99, and it is great. But I thought an upgrade would be good. I want to work with my digital pictures, including the ones that are already stored in the Picture It 99 program. But I can't find out how to move those picture over to the new program. And in Picture It 99, I can put in one word for a Search, such as ""Mexico"" and it will bring up every file with that name in it. I can't find out how to do this with the new program. Every thing I have tried to do has been a failure, and the built-in Help doesn't help, as evidently I can't find the desired capabilities because this program has LESS features than the previous one.I believe it does have some new features such as Illusions that might do great things with pictures, but I can't bring up my pictures to use the new stuff. So again it is a disappointment."
3,Better than Suspiria,"After wasting my time watching Suspiria, I decided to give Argento another chance with this film. Opera was much better, in my opinion. This film has one of the best kill scenes I've seen in a movie yet (the knife through the jaw is great)! A few slow spots, but overall, a decent and entertaining film."
4,goo but over done ending,loved it then as opera went on i hung in there then came the end and i was falling asleep which i questioned cause the acting was good the suspense was good yet i was falling asleep this movie should sell for a dollar seriously deep red was better !
1,"If you've seen one Argento giallo, you've seen them all","Dario Argento's ""Opera"" is a skillful piece of filmmaking, as are the vast majority of his movies. The central problem with Argento's giallos (and most giallos in general) is this: I've seen it all before. Basically, Argento hit upon a certain style (both in terms of plot and technique) a long time ago, and he's spent three decades repeating himself. If you want to experience Argento, you should START with ""Deep Red"" -- and you should STOP with ""Deep Red."" ""Opera"" is tedious because it's just like all of Argento's other giallos. If I want to see the same movie over and over again, I'll watch ""Deep Red"" again; watching ""Opera"" is a waste of time."
5,"Beautiful, Captivating","This is a beautifully written mystery, definately one of Christie's best. Hercule Poirot is in his prime. The end of the book is positively horrifying, as it should be. I really could not put this chilling book down. Every mystery fan will enjoy this fabulous piece of work, and will also be shocked by the outcome in the end"
5,Review,"Excellent read and very informative. Makes me sad how other countries embrace the contributions of the Black race and the US erases it. Pathetic that our children, black and white, don't know the contributions of all races."
4,WARNING-READ BEFORE BUYING,This game is NOT GOOD-its the worst resident evil game-all other resident evil games are VERY GOOD-I am not just saying this to prejudice-it is a trully bad game.-very long loading times-online cant use a headset-takes forever to set up online-to hard to control-controls are very bad-to hard to shoot and use items-to many glitches and freezes alot-there are also many other problems
3,Residential Evil Outbreak,The game play takes too much time on loading every time screen change to go to next room. It lack of feel of horror which previous Residential Evil 2 & 3 had. It is OK because it has improved grphic and movement of character. Game is too short.
4,Let the nightmares begin!!,"Although I'm not very far in this game, I cannot stop playing! Time has no meaning when you have a great game like Resident Evil: Outbreak! I've slept a few hours in the past 3 days....The whole Resident Evil series is great, and this is NO exception! I have to say, I was a bit leary after ""Veronica"", but this game will not dissapoint lovers of the ""classic"" R.E.(like myself). The graphics are top-notch, game play is smooth, and scary as it gets! BUY THIS GAME, turn out all the lights, turn up your speakers(Amazing in surround sound!), and let the nightmares begin!"
4,Bad,"Heard of the new Resident Evil for the PS2 and got all excited, then I played it. Graphics are good but not the greatest in the series. There is no storyline what so ever, no explination or backstory on any charater, but the killer of this game is the horrible loading times. It felt like i spent more time in loading screens than in actually game play. Do your self a favor and rent it first, like I thankfully did and will pass up buying this game, and wait for the, what i hope to be far better Resident Evil 4."
4,Awesome game overall!!!,The game resident evil outbreak has farly surpassed all the other games in its series. However it does have some thing wrong here i will list all the benefits and all the wrongs!Pros*Alot of zombiee action and shooting*Keeping others supplied and alive is pretty realistic (Even though i do not enjoy it)*New zombie moans and groans keeping the zombies cooler*Arsenal of weapons*New music for better gameplayCons*Keeping others alive i think is very difficult and annoying but like i said realistic*Ammo is harder to find realistic but frustrating*You die quiker*your partners die quicker than you*less puzzles*And last but not least harder controls than the other games in the series!!Overall capcom really did the best out of the series than other game series!!!Great game capcom
5,A must have!,"I've always been a huge fan of Resident Evil. This is definitely a must have in the series, it's not a money maker or a quick fill in. Outbreak tells the story of the civilians of Raccoon City trying to escape the unexplainable nightmare. This game brings new light to the Resident Evil franchise. Online play makes the game so much more real. People do what they want to do and respond how they want to respond. The environments are breath taking and the game play is unmatched. It's the only Resident Evil I've played that has a good reply value, with 8 playable characters plus 31 characters to unlock. It's not just online either there's a scenario mode which you can also unlock new characters, levels, movies, photos, music, and a couple other things... he he! All I have to say is play it for yourself, you won't be disappointed."
2,"Great Graphics, Great Cutscene, HORRIBLE GAMEPLAY!!!","I played this game for maybe 40 minutes before asking myself, ""what's the point?"" The game is non responsive, un logical, and completely boring. I will say though, the graphics are AMAZING and the opening cutscene is maybe my favorite cutscene of all time.Anyways, I'm trading this in for a PS2 copy of RE4 today, and I expect most people will want to do the same."
4,great... but not what i was waiting for.,i waited and waited for this game. When i got it i felts so excited and could barely wait to get home to play it. It was so great but a little repeditive. It is still good (the best RE in my opinion) just not what i was expecting... well maybe RE 4 will be better. (...)
1,Rent before you buy,"This game has impressive graphics, but it's unbelievable how many hold times there are!!! Every single time you change a room, there is a hold time. I felt like I was waiting half the time and playing the game the other half. I actually want to play more of this game, but I don't want to deal with waiting every minute or so when I have to go into another room. Get rid of the countless hold times and this game is great. They should have put more time/effort into this game."
3,a satisfying EP,"Boards Of Canada have refined their sound from MHTRTC, but not their song structures and compositions. Once they establish their grooves and melodies in their tracks, nothing much happens. You may call it minimalism, but you can call it lazyness, too. This a pleasant EP, but it is far less rewarding then their previous full-lenght."
2,life is short,"I bought this item because of the cast, and it is admittedly a pleasure to watch them in performance. But there are too many excellent heist movies and TV series out there (the two ITALIAN JOBs, THE STING, $ with Warren Beatty, even a near-noir morality tale from the pre-Code Thirties called THE WRONG ROAD, and such box sets as MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and HUSTLE) that this one can't compete. It's not only slow, but slow in sewer full of liquid offal--not the most pleasant place to spend one's movietime."
5,The Possibilities,"If Sonny Rollins had continued in this direction, he might not have been eclipsed by John Coltrane as the most influential tenor saxophonist. This album is one of David S. Ware's personal favorite jazz albums. East Broadway Rundown is also free and an excellent cd but what makes this one different is that it is live. Sonny Rollins has been deemed by critics to be at his best live (after seeing him live, I would support this). Also, with the members of Ornette Coleman's groundbreaking quartet (except of course Ornette) backing him up, the album has the same manic energy and unpredictability of early free jazz. It still is grounded in hard bop, because Sonny Rollins while wanting to absorb the ""new thing in jazz"" was still somewhat of a traditionalist. However, this is his most creative and innovative playing and is a standout among the myriad of albums he has recorded."
5,Unbelievably good improvisation,This is one of the most exciting improvisational jazz sax albums you will ever here. This album contains Rollins suspended between melody and sheer bop improvisation. An extraordinary album of freedom and excitement - possibly the best Sonny Rollins album you will hear.
5,AN ALBUM FULL OF BEAUTY AND DEPTH!!,"This album is different from Jack's more commercial sounding ones. It sounds almost a bit classical. The songs range from romantic and beautiful and outright sad and heavy.This album has a lot of depth in both the singing and arranging. And of course LeGrand and is a fantastic composer!If you just discovered Jack Jones, this may be a bit heavy but if you're a serious fan, GO FOR IT!"
3,"An ""ok"" book.","My girlfriend is a rape victim and I was looking for a book that could help me help her, understand her, without me going insane--it's very tough :(I kind of liked the book (that's why 3 stars), but it lacks information that focuses on ""friends, family and loved ones."" Granted, each little topic has a small section for such people, but it's not enough.If you're looking for an [I'm the partner of a rape victim and want to know what to do and how to react from a psychological, intimate, and love/affection point of view] book, then this one is clearly not what you're looking for."
1,"John Waters fans, get over yourselves...","I get it that this is a cult movie for afficionados of John Waters.None of that changes the fact that it has not aged well, despite the fact that Tab Hunter IS kind of cute.Okay, I do kind of like the ""odorama"" gimmick. But that's not enough to redeem this seedy, pseudo-subversive film. I do understand that the obvious charges against it -- sad, sorry, sexist, stupid, stereotyped, shoddy, etc. -- are beside the point; the response from defenders can only be ""DUH!"" Of course that's the point. Outrage! (with a capital O!!)But really is that enough of a point? No, I don't think so. This bizarre and tired film will deservedly sink to oblivion with (not very much more) time -- and good luck to it! I wouldn't wish watching it on my worst enemy. Life is too short to spend ANY of it on such low-budget dreck.I definitely recommend against wasting your money here!"
5,Cuddles and Francine make the film a classic.,"I had not seen the film, only little clips from You Tube. I knew I would like the film. I saw it and immediately I fell in love with the characters and the story. Divine is once again great, especially as Francine Fishpaw and Cuddles is superb and in my opinion underrated. Both actresses uplift the film to vast proportions. Divine is very Elizabeth Taylor mixed with some flavor and the character Cuddles is hilarious, her dialogue is worth buying the film in itself. I recommend any John Waters fans to buy this, it's a must have for anyone's DVD Collection."
4,Nice gift book for teenage girls,"I purchased copies of this book (signed by two of the featured girls locally!) to give my 14 year old nieces on their birthdays. I wrote each niece a letter saying I hoped the book would inspire them, etc., and sent them off, fingers crossed. They both LOVED them. In fact, one of my niece's friends asked where she could get a copy too! The profiles are so diverse I think every girl can find someone to relate to. A nice gift book that will be browsed often."
4,TuneTie's Rock,These things are the best way I've found to carry around my iPod headphones while avoiding a serpentine mess of cords in my pocket. Highly recommended.
2,Stick with the videos,I was excited to get some books for my little Backyardgigans loving guy. But...we purchased a few books and they just aren't all that great. It tries to flow like the tv show and it just doesn't work in a book format. It's too wordy and boring. I would skip the books and stick with the music and videos. The music is what makes the Backyardigans great!
2,Teenage Live Journal,"I was disappointed. I bought this book because it was interesting for me to read what a New-York poet can tell me about Queen poetry, Queen meaning for the world. But instead it I found a live journal of 12-years old teenager who even cannot tell what he want to say. Today I eat my soup and thought about Brian May. Looking to my picture disk -how are you, Roger? And this kind of thoughts from the beginning to the end. If it's good tribute from American writer -my condolences to modern American literature. Queen didn't deserved so poor tribute. Shame."
3,Scarpetta books are getting harder to read.,"I just discovered this series a few years ago. I enjoyed the first few books immensely and thought Cornwell had a good series started. However, I took a long hiatus from the series before picking up this particular book. I find the protagonist hard to relate to and the Lucy storyline not relevant to the plot in any way. I have to agree with some other reviewers when they said this would have been a good place to end the series. I will continue to read the series for now, but am finding them increasingly harder and harder to get into."
4,"Good reading, you will learn something about ""Fire""","I have read every book by Patricia Cornwell. Point of Origin was interesting for me because I had no idea of what goes on to determine how and where a fire starts. As for the story, it was her typical style, but I had some disappointments regarding Dr. Kay Scarpetta's relationship with Benton. But maybe she and Marino can hook-up now.....LOL. I guess I will have to wait for the next book. If you are a follower of these books, do not hesitate to read it. bye"
2,Too much angst mars Scarpetta series,"Having read all the Patricia Cornwell's previous Kay Scarpetta books, I was nonetheless ambivalent about starting her new one, Point of Origin. Although they are dark of necessity, the series had become depressing because nothing good ever happens to anyone! All of Kay's relationships -- whether with coworkers, her sister and mother, significant other Wesley Benton, investigative sidekick Marino, or beloved niece Lucy -- are fraught with tension and mistrust. Everyone seems depressed and unhappy, including Kay herself. And for good reason -- life is always dealing Kay, her friends and family, a low blow. Before I started this book, I told my husband that if something good doesn't happen to somebody in this one, I wouldn't be reading another one. I closed the cover today -- Kay Scarpetta, adios!"
2,so-so,"Although the book may have been well written, better than a lot of the drivel out there, I was disappointed in PC. Do relatives of gays/lesbians really dwell that much on the subject? Who cares? I think I liked Lucy better when she was an unbelievable child prodigy.This book would have been better if she could have just come up with an original villian. The forensics and investigation of the fire scenes were great.I have read Cornwell for years, but if this doesn't pick up..."
5,I couldn't put it down!!,"Ever since I read my first Patricia Cornwell novel, which happened to be ""Body of Evidence"", I have eagerly anticipated her books. I then read ""Postmortem"" and every one since. I cannot tell you how much I love her books. ""Point of Origin"" was wonderful. I read it in two days. I couldn't put it down. Her style of writing makes you want to start reading it all over again. When's the next one coming out again?"
3,Scarpetta needs a break,"I enjoy the novels of Patricia Cornwell. When one comes out, I rush to buy it. After this one, I am not so sure that I will be in such a hurry next time. I feel sorry for Kay Scarpetta. She has no husband, no children, and an all-consuming job that no one in their right mind would want. After this novel, I feel even sorrier for her. She should have gone to Hilton Head. That was her first mistake. She should get some psychiatric help after this book. She is always putting down Marino, but that guy, at least, knows how to enjoy himself. Kay needs a life, a new man/woman, and a new career (teaching college or something). She's burning out."
2,Enough already.,"This is my last Patricia Cornwell book, or at least the last ""Kay Scarpetta, M.E."" book. Patricia Cornwell makes this character so pretentious it's hard to concentrate on the plot. I really tired of reading long descriptive passages about her perfectly appointed house, her car, the vintage wines she drinks, Benton's watch, and on and on. The story lines are usually interesting and exciting, but not worth suffering through endless accounts of Dr. Kay's wealth and privileged lifestyle ad nauseum. Not only is everything she has the best, most expensive, rare, etc., but things are described in minute detail. This is not Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Goodbye, doc."
2,This was one of her goriest books ever!,"I have read and loved Cornwell's books from the first one she wrote, but with each one she seems to be losing her touch. This latest one was the times because of the unnecessary blood and gore she seemed to find necessary to throw in just any old time!!!"
1,Very lacking in knowledge of arson and fire investigation,"Ms. Cornwell should have stayed with the field she knew best...the FBI and forensic pathology. In this book, she has moved her characters over to the ATF National Response Team. No reason is given, and we are supposed to believe that Kay, Marino et al were allowed to this elite team since Lucy joined ATF. In addition, she makes it look like the ATF National Response Team runs to nearly every fatal fire around. This, I can assure you, is not the case. Other faults include having ATF agents baffled by how a fire started, even when a piece of magnesium is found at the scene. Come on...Give the ATF some credit for having some brains.She also showed her lack of knowledge of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in almost every area where PA was involved.In total, the book was a fair read, but was so off the mark with factual items, it made it hard to believe anything."
4,Intriguing,"We found 'Point Of Origin' another one of Cornwell's excellent reading of and about Scarpetta's intriguing case load. Again once we got started we couldn't stop. We went from Hornest's Nest to Point of Origin so we know we are missing inbetween as some of the story didn't make sense and we had a feeling we had missed something. (Benton's & Scarpetta's affair and Benton's marriage breakup.) Hopefully this author will continue this story (no bodies found!) and now the 3 main characters will continue on with the struggle of trying to make a difference in their world. We won't give away the ending, but we all felt Kay's pain like we were right there at Hilton Head Island. Great reading 4 Christmas or 4 a gift."
1,Point of Origin,I too feel that her books have gotten progressively less intriguing and a LOT more disgustingly descriptive. Definitely not a great literary feat!
2,"Faithful Reader, yet still not pleased..","I'm a faithful reader of all of Cornwell's novels, and as muchas I love her characters Marino, Scarpetta, Lucy and others, I thinkthe cast and storyline has been beaten a few too many times. It'd be refreshing to read some new characters with a new plot, though I don't mind the medical part of it at all :)"
2,Dr. Scarpetta's funk dampens this novel,Perhaps the author is depressed about something. It seems so because Dr. Scarpetta is so down in the dumps about life and everything around her that she drags this novel down with her. The woman is having no fun. She ought to change jobs and get a life so readers won't go away from this one so unhappy. The pace is slow. The climax unbelievable. Ms. Cornwell's new love of flying helicopters obviously flew parts of this book into places it should never have gone.
4,If you like suspense.........,"You will love this book. Patricia Cornwell does again in ""Point Of Origin!"" I have always been a fan and have yet to be disappointed in her series. This book is full of twists and will definitely keep you guessing. The ending is very suprising and some what disappointing at the same time. I love Kay, Lucy, Marino and Benton and am sad that we are now minus one of them. I will continue to read Patrica's series of books and highly recommend that you buy this book."
2,Point Of Origin,"I have read and enjoyed a few Patricia Cornwell novels.Point Of Origin seemed rather flat in comparison. I never really got pulled into this story and the ending fizzled. The reason I jumped onto Amazon today was to look up her earlier works I may have missed. I wanted to get back to the ""good stuff""."
5,Excellent!,"Loved it! No disapointments here, Patricia has once again weaved us thru the labrinth of murder and mystery. Scarpetta is a fantastic character, Lucy is great! Marino is great! and very very sad about Benton, she brings you so close to her characters that you feel like you've honestly shared their entire lives. If you haven't read this book, I would definitely recommend it, and her newest book ""Black Notice"" is even better."
1,"Scarpetta, Snap Out of It!","I can't believe this is the same person who wrote Post-Mortem. If there has ever been a more pathetically depressed character than Kay Scarpetta, I sure haven't read it. She used to be so interesting, and now she just cries and drags her tired self around, worrying about her neice to the point where I want to scream. I was truly hoping Lucy would turn the gun on her aunt and end the series. Everybody she writes about is tired, sick, depressed, paranoid, and a constant target. And what's with the helicopter chase? Why must Cornwell turn Scarpetta into an action hero? Can't we just have a good forensic mystery without terrorists, plagues, NY Times Front Page Headlines, and ridiculous action sequences to end the books? Read Post-Mortem again, if you've forgotten how good she used to be. Please Ms. Cornwell, give me a book that doesn't make me want to kill myself after I've read it."
2,POO.....correct term for title and what I thought of it.,"This has to be one of the worst PC books I've read. The characters have become shallow and caught up in personal problems that weigh down the book. I am most disappointed in the way PC handled the whole plot of Wesley Benton. KS had lost her touch in this book....why so concerned with Lucy...why the lack of concern and care for Benton???? Please, PC, hear what Amazon readers are saying! Handle the characters with more care. Whatever personal problems you might be having....leave them out of KS lives. Find a way to undo the Benton plot....SMILE"
1,A potboiler of no distinction,"This was my first Scarpetta novel; it will be my last. A flimsy plot: as another reviewer has already said, not ""intellectually challenging."" The characters are not credible: the women are overachieving amazons, the men are all cardboard cut-out cliches; even when the heroine's live-in is murdered, there's little genuine sense of loss.... The arsonist's methods take far too long to figure out -- a pointless ""mystery"" (I'm a Fire Marshal). The motivation of the serial killer is clinically wrong, an unabashed lift from ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" where the motivation was also wrong.... (See John Douglas, ANATOMY OF MOTIVE.) The final confrontation, fought with handguns between helicopters, is not credible, either -- in fact, downright Hollywood ""silly"" (I'm a pilot, too). The novel is a waste of time and money."
1,Unreadable,"I loved Patricia Cornwell's first couple of books, but this book is just awful. The writing is dreadful, and the plot? She's sleepwalking through this one. Has Cornwell become so powerful that her publisher dares not edit her manuscripts? If you want good mysteries that are also well written, try Lisa Scottoline or Dennis Lehane. Give this one a pass!"
1,Beyond Boring,"This is my second Patricia Cornwell book, also my last. Kay isa totally unlikeable character. She is self-involved, arrogant, humourless, and totally one dimensional. I could never understand why Benton (hate that name) would be interested in her.I agree with everyone else's reviews on the gigantic plot holes.Also I find it very hard to believe that a ME would get so involved in every case in the state. I have never heard of a criminal blaming the ME and then going after her.I kept reading just to finish it and was so disappointed I said never again."
1,I'm crossing this author off my list!,"If you make the mistake of starting this book, don't kid yourself into thinking that if you keep reading it's got to get better. It just gets worse. The writing is so bad I wonder if she's really the one who wrote it. It's extremely violent (worse that her other books)."
2,Too much,"I've read all of the Kay Scarpetta books and maybe I've just gotten tired of them. Granted the series is about a forensic pathologist, but this one was just too twisted and too morbid for my tastes. No more tormented Lucy, no more persecuted righteous protagonist, no more buying Patricia Cornwell novels."
2,Too much,"I've read all of the Kay Scarpetta books and maybe I've justgotten tired of them. Granted the series is about a forensic pathologist, but this one was just too twisted and too morbid for my tastes. No more tormented Lucy, no more persecuted righteous protagonist, no more buying Patricia Cornwell novels."
1,A tedious unsatisfying romp with Scarpetta.,"The book is mired in techno babble research that Patricia Cornwell must have spent hours investigating to get correct. But the story line suffers immensely. And worst of all, the final confrontation doesn't really exist between Dr. S and her nemesis. One can almost see the word ""Sequel"" flashing on the last few pages. Very disappointing, tedious and time consuming. A reader of such books wants in addition to learning processes and procedures (which PC has downpat) an exiting suspense driven story. This really fails to deliver.Having read the review from readers vs publishing concerns, it is interesting to see how places like Booklist praise the book to high heaven while the consumer out there yawns."
5,this book derserves more than 5 stars...there are NO words!!,"This was PC best work yet. You need to have a stomach for it. She shows how the mentally ill can manipulate people, how the legal system excepts certain criteria. I love medicine though I honestly could NOT perform autopsy. I give credit to people who can perform this task with great detail as there is always as story as is stated in this book and PC others as well. I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels that details are a part of life. To the people who felt this story was old - I can only suggest you actually go out and look around at the world. Go to the mental hospitals and prisons. Open your eyes...I salute Patricia Cornwell....!"
5,OUTSTANDING! One of Cornwell's best.,I'd put off buying Point of Origin because of the mixed reviews but broke down when I needed a good holiday read. I could not put it down and read it in less than a day. Cornwell is back in form. This is one of her best.
2,BORING and predictable,"I don't plan to bother with any more books in this series. At least in this one, the reader was not subjected to as many detailed descriptions of Dr. Scarpetta's culinary prowess, but there was still a lot of self indulgence. Having killed off Benton, no doubt Lucy and Marino will go down the tubes before too long. Cornwell and Scarpetta have exhausted this theme."
2,slow and disappointing,"The pace is slow and when the mystery is solved, the result not very original. There was not much motivation for the actions of the bad guys in this book. Maybe I should have read the earlier Kay Scarpetti books."
2,When will PC go back to what she's good at?,"Since ""Body Farm"", I was always full of hope when I picked up a new book by PC. But yet again, I got disappointed. What really makes PC's book interesting is how she made use of her professional knowledge in pathology in dramatic plot. It seems that now she has turned her attention to politics and romance, which she is definitely not good at. If she doesn't go back to basic ASAP, her name will vanish in the best seller list very soon."
2,Glad I got it at the library for free...,"Well, at least I wasn't TOO disappointed. Since the last few Scarpetta novels left much to be desired, I was not expecting much out of this one. But - I loved her first three so much, I kept thinking maybe she's pulled it back together. No such luck.I cannot imagine that a reader could understand this book without having read the others before it. I am so sick of Lucy and her chronic problems, and the rest of them, too. I didn't care if she killed a major character off. The book was empty. Give me a break.I enjoyed the ealier books because they were exciting, and scary, and you never knew what would happen next. The last few are just tired, like Cornwell har run out of ideas - or maybe she is exorcising demons of her own. I am bored with the series. END"
1,A boring disappointment,"Having been a devoted fan of all of Patricia Cornwell's novels, I was excited by the prospect of a new addition to the collection. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Dr. Kay Scarpetta appeared incredibly one-dimensional and was insufferable in her ""holier-than-thou manner. I kept expecting Marino to keel over from a heart attack (probably in the next one) as she harped on his bad habits. The relationships among the characters were worn and tired. All in all, a waste of money in the hardcover edition."
4,The plot that will keep you wondering.,"Patricia Cornwell wrote yet another masterpiece. Like all of her other books, Patricia kept me on the edge of my set througout the whole book. If you want to read a book that has an undescribable theme and plot, then Point of Origin is the book for you. Dr. Kay Scrapetta is once again a magnificent character, and is the true heart to this story. Patricia Cornwell's use of details and imagination is the heart and soul to this everlasting story. Thanks Patricia, can't wait for your next book."
5,FILM,AN AWESOME FILM. JUST ANOTHER REASON AS TO WHY GILLIAN ANDERSON SHINES IN ANYTHING AND EVERYTING THAT SHE DOES. THE CAST OF COURSE IS ALSO GREAT.
4,Tuns of funs,"I searched relentlessly for a fun multi-player shooter, and that search ended when I found this freakin' awesome box of nutbaggery. I've never enjoyed a game so much. One of these days, I'll actually try the single-player mode."
5,george carlin,great loved it would recommend to friends and family a very cleaver man indeed if you had more in new zealand on sky tv more people would see how funny this guy is
4,1974 show at Montreux,"This is not a long album. Little Milton takes up less than 10 minutes of it in his two songs (Let Me Down Easy, We're Gonna Make It). Chico gets a single cut, the first cut ""In View"" (12:20), in which he smokes - a nice opening to the show. The last 3 songs are King in fine form in this vintage 1974 show at Montreux - could have offered us more, but it's better than nothing."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This is definitely not a ""feel-good"" gay movie.. its a glimpse of a sick and twisted person exploiting a drug addict for his pleasure. Not a movie you walk away from feeling good about seeing it."
3,No complaints until it broke - lasted 13 months,"I loved everything about this toaster oven until the circuitry caught on fire last week. It went out almost as fast as it started (no extinguisher needed, but that's the end of our toaster oven. The convection feature was good, but I don't think it really sped up cooking times that much (but then it's the only convection oven I've had so I have no comparison)."
2,Not so good,"First off I would like to say I have been a huge Blink fan for years. This album has a couple stand out tracks, such as ""It's Hurts"" "" The Adventure"", and ""Good Day"", despite it's bad lyrics. However, for the most part, the songs are melodically devoid. It's almost as if Tom decided to pay more attention to all the crazy sounds he could get on this album rather then actually worrying about the songs structures themselves.You can put all the crazy synth effects you want in a song, but if the core of the song stripped down is bad, then it's a bad song. Hardly a song on here has any interesting hooks, or envokes any emotion. They are all just very mediocre.It amazes me that people can say this is better then Blink, because it doesn't even come close. Two heads are better then one, and the Mark and Tom songwriting team isn't going to be beat by Tom alone."
1,So Progressive!!!!!,"God this album is progressive. Some of the songs go over 5 minutes long and I love it. It's not crappy like Opeth or Dream Theater but it's awesome. Man what beautiful guitars. I'm an experienced guitarist who still can't play this stuff quickly. Forget Opeth or Dream Theater, Angels and Airwaves rules!That was more sarcasm. Angels and Airwaves try to be progressive but fail misreably and can't compete with Opeth or Dream Theater."
3,Its OK,"Well I love Blink 182 and Box Car Racer and figured why not with this CD. Now i wasnt going in with any ideas or thinking that it was going to be a clone of blink, but I still didnt like the style and sound. Its and OK CD but nothing like Box Car Racer was. I would rather have a new Blink or Box Car CD out than this. Listening throught the cd there are some good songs but for the most part the song all sound alike which i really do not like. Having heard Tom's new band it makes me wonder what Mark's new band (Plus 44) is going to sound like hopfully it will be more impressive than AVA has been."
3,When will this song end?,"Unfortunately, unlike +44's When Your Heart Stops Beating, this cd has little to no variety. If you're paying attention, you'll surely be able to tell one track from the next, but if you're not, you'll be wondering ""when will this song end?!"" Each song is beautifully written, but there's definitely not enough variety to keep me listening. I'd rate each song individually a 4, but overall this cd gets a 3/5."
3,Repeats itself,"This CD was a dissappointment in my opinion. I really love a couple of the songs on it, but all the songs sound the same. After listening to the whole cd it started over and I didn't even know it because they all sound alike. Like I said I like the sound, and a couple songs are great, but it's not worth the 13.99 new price. I would preview it first before purchasing, if I were you."
4,Music 5 stars - Vocals 3 stars,"I am not and never have been a fan of Blink 182. However, I heard the Adventure and immediately ran out to buy the CD.Musically the CD is fantastic. Layered and full sounding, excellent lyrics etc. People are comparing it to U2 but it sounds more like old school-progressive rock than U2. Another plus is it goes for a unique sound and certainly does its own thing.My only issue here is either you like the vocals of Tom Delonge or you don't. I fall in the latter category - the words seem over pronounced and he comes off as a bit whiny sounding. I guess if you already liked Blink you were used to his vocal style.If you are over 35 (Like this reviewer) and want to hear this type of music, go buy an old Dream Theatre CD."
5,GREAT! CD!!!!,"This Cd is absolutely awsome!! This Cd blows Boxcar Racer out of the water, dont get me wrong i like Boxcar Racer. I think its all and more that Tom Hyped it up to be!! A must get for those true blink 182 fans.."
3,just good album,"Its a good album. I'm not a huge emo fan, but it touches on the alternative genre enough to entertain even non-emos.It would be a 4 or 5 star album with a different singer and a better lyrics. Delonge just isn't a good vocalist. I'd suggest to him become a producer, he just doesn't have the range or chops. His voice stays in the same octave the entire CD.The lead guitar is great. Ripped from old school Edge, but still sounds great."
3,Not fit for almonds,"good for hazelnuts and walnuts, but almonds not so much, the nuts slip out and you have to hold the nut tightly to crack it."
5,Tallis-----Beautifully Sung,"The Tallis Scholars remind me of my 11 years of choral singing and the special ""ear-traing"" that comes with it.What a joy these 2 Cd's are !"
3,Think agian you HALF-WIT,"My review isn't about the movie itself but really about the other revews. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie, I thought it was ALOT better than the second one but not as good as the orignal, wich gets me to my point. After reading the other reviews for this movie I have to disagree when people say the first 2 were ""wittiy"". Sure the second one seemed to be more of a comedy but I think it is totally inapproiat to say Return Of The Living Dead 1 is ""witty"". I mean come on it has to be one of the best ""zombie"" movies ever made and most definatlly the best cult classic to this date. So please next time somone even thinks of calling this movie ""witty"" think agian you half-wit."
3,Good but cheesy.,"This movie starts well, but it gets cheesy toward the mid-end of it. I find this movie to be scary and gory as it should be. I own George Romero's collection movies and I still find them more serious and realistic than this one. Overall: GOOD. (actually more like 3-1/2 stars)."
3,"This movie is not meant to be taken seriously, obviously.","This is a zombie movie with a cheesey love story attacted to it. I gave it three stars cause it has a lot of nostalgia for me. I saw it when I was 15 and was into gory horror films (which it is a very gory movie.) But now that I'm 21, I see that this movie was pretty bad as far as acting and plot goes. Return of the living dead part 3 was made in 1993, so there was a lot of instances where they would try to tye it to pop culture. For example, the main charactor's name is Curt and later on when he's in the sewer with Julie and the homeless man he says wants to go to seattle and start a band. That's a pathatic attempted at trying to be hip. Also self-mutilation was coming up to the surface around that time, and coincidentally Juile can only stop the hunger by hurting herself. Also the ending is predicable. Only see this movie if your into sappy, cheesey love stories and huge amounts of blood and guts."
2,Very bad sequel,"This movie had very few zombies (except for the end), and the zombies were all weird looking, not like normal zombies. And the main girl zombie can talk and run. A zombie does not run! This movie gets 2 stars because of the zombies that raid the scientific complex thingy at the end."
5,an orginial zombie film,"This has got to be the most orginial zombie film ever.No world wide zombies,just a handful of zombies roaming the streets.And one of the most hottest zombie chicks i have ever seen.Also a great ""gothic"" romance.A living boy still in love with his dead girlfriend.I find that to be really really sweet."
2,a needless sequel,i liked the first2 rotld movies but this one is not as fun as the others.There are few zombies in this movie but okay special effex if you are watching the unrated version
3,Majestic soul music...but not the best!,"Andina tyle of music sounds very pretty in my opinion but not every single song is going to be great. Alma Sonidera is an album which carries some good songs but I was not too impressed by the whole thing. Two of the groups that are in this CD, Los Papis and Grupo Maravilla, are few of my personal favorites but the song selection for each are not at all thier best work. I do not know how they end up picking a song from each group that is not good. My favorite songs ended being track 8. El Verde De Tus Ojos - Las Estrellas Andinas, and track 11. Usted Que Haria - Amor Y Pasion. Both are groups I never even heard of. If you love cumbias andinas then you must buy this album but do not expect something special."
3,chaplin 57 classic shorts-BCI DVD,"a good set for the money. there are 5 double sided discs and one single disc with a Chaplin documentary hosted by Burgess Meredith. There are shorts from 1914-1918, mostly of low to medium grade quality with less than satisfactory music scores. and also, features such as ""the kid"" and others. if you want quality, i suggest the restored sets from ""image"" and the like.but this is a lot of Chaplin for a little money. not bad."
4,An engaging romp,"Both my 12-year-old son and I enjoyed this movie. Great actors/actresses who looked like they were having fun filming it. The movie looks a bit dated vis a vis technology, but it's still fun.If you're looking for enjoyable entertainment with a bit of suspense, I would recommend Sneakers! :-)Tim WarnekaLeading People the Black Belt Way: Conquering the Five Core Problems Facing Leaders TodayBlack Belt Leader, Peaceful Leader: An Introduction to Catholic Servant LeadershipThe Way of Leading People: Unlocking Your Integral Leadership Skills with the Tao Te ChingHealing Katrina: Volunteering in Post-Hurricane Mississippi"
4,It makes you smile!,"Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Ackroyd - you can't go wrong! And this film doesn't! It's funny and smart filled with great one-liners. Just thinking of Dan Ackroyd as the paranoid conspiracy theorist makes me smile. It's lots of fun for both men & women, that's why I got a copy for myself and a copy for my dad. Put on your comfy slippers and enjoy ""Sneakers."""
4,Acceptably Entertaining Movie,"This is a pretty good ""spy""-tech movie. Robert Redford leads a cast of security experts: Sidney Poitier, Dan Ackroyd, River Phoenix, David Straithairn. The crew get caught up in a series of plot twists that would ruin the movie if I were to even begin to talk about them. I'll just say nothing is as it seems. Trust me."
4,Great Movie!,"This movie has it all: action, suspense, comedy. It's a feel good movie on top of that! My only criticism is that the big ""suspense"" ending completely falls apart (storyline-wise, that is)...one minute they're surrounded, the next minute they're all alone to make an easy escape. But don't let that get you down! Buy this and enjoy one of River Phoenix's last movies. Well acted and lots of fun!"
4,Never heard of this,Was unaware that this movie was ever made. Maybe it is the title??? Could have picked a title with a bit more intrigue and glamour. Had the potential to be outstanding then fizzled
3,FIlm Doesn't Cut It...,"Sneakers is a wanna-be thriller with a story line that is a mish-mash of government intelligence agencies, computers, encryption, spying, blackmail, and so on.Computers in large institutions give me headaches not entertainment. Robert Redford usually makes quality movies, but this one fell short. The components of the plot are cliches. Without any good roles in the script, even this all-star cast couldn't salvage it.Maybe I should point out that most other people liked this one!"
1,"Bad product, surprising from Mt. Hagen","One of the worst instant coffee mixes. The fat does not blend and floats on the surface. Buy the Mt Hagen instant, instead, and add your own sugar, milk and maybe, cinammon. I returned this product."
2,try something else,"It is of very flimsy and cheap construction. The design is not well thought out, for example the cover falls off easily, leaving open circuits exposed. There is no slit, so that it is necessary to remove this cover in order to insert the card. It did not work for me at all. I tried several different computers.Regards,proclus[...]"
3,Not very sturdy,"It works well to transfer images from the Smartedia card to the computer but it is certainly not sturdy enought to belong on a keychain. The cover for the card is difficult to attach securely. That said, it does work well to transfer pictures from the camera card to the computer without using the camera."
2,I was expecting something more academic & less anecdotal,"The author makes good points and appears to know of which he speaks. He is unbiased and concludes largely that the difference between the jews and palestinians is (largely) a factor of ... P.R. I was, however, expecting a more academic approach to the issue instead of the author's own personal observations and reflections on history. The text read as if you were talking to the author ... which leads me to my next point ...I have a background in editing and proof reading and was really, really, (really) distracted by the author's writing style. He never met a hyphen, elipses, or parenthetical that he didn't like. I would give him more stars if the publisher provided a refund for the time I lost due to the (extreme) overuse of punctuation.(Sorry ... but I could not find a place in my review for a ... hyphen)."
1,dishonest and disgraceful,"Cramer is intellectually and factually dishonest in his portrayal of the situation. He presents a particular view that sees only from that one, incomplete, perspective. Sad, but typical, that many people will not care to examine the issues much further, but that will not stop them from talking as if they know it all! I would not give it any star at all, but am required to give it at least one."
2,Interesting - But Unabashedly Biased,"For someone with still unformed opinions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I found this book to be a dangerous primer - unabashedly biased and shockingly slanted. While the writing style is engaging and intersting, the message is almost propagandistic. Only the Palestinian side is addressed with any sympathy - Israeli victims of terror are ignored and it is plainly unbalanced. It appears that most of the reviewers' on Amazon are letting their political opinions interfere with their objective review of the text. Needless to say, the issue is quite heated and this book does nothing but fan the flames. If you already have strong opinions and don't want to be bothered by a book that presents facts on both sides or has even the pretense of journalistic integrity, then this book is for you."
1,Agggh!,Same problem here... I was hoping to see Ep. 11 but like the above complaints it was Ep. 10 all over again. I hope this issue can be resolved.
4,What a nice surprise,"My husband and I watched the first episode of Season 1 on a whim. What a treat. An intelligent, warm and sincere program that reminded me of ""Mayberry""...moved 50 years into the future and in a small Irish town. The characters are true to themselves and the stories are not (generally) predictable. If you like ""Downton Abbey"", ""Keeping Up Appearances"" and the ""Vicar of Dibley"", you time with ""BallyK"" will be richly rewarded."
5,An Exciting Modern Classic,"I picked this book up not knowing what it was about, just knowing that it had won the Pulitzer. I have now read it twice; the first time I read it I thought very highly of it, but the second time I read it I not only looked at it as one of the greatest American Classics of our time but I looked at it as a fun, early 1900's, college book. One part of the book I exspecially liked was when Martin confesed to both of his girlfriends that he was engaged to both of them at the same time! I love it! Sinclair Lewis was so ahead of his time with that episode! This is Lewis' finest work, a homage to the art of medicine and the spirit of a young man searching for himself and his career. A must have book!"
4,Developing Character,"A period piece of early twentieth century America, this book still remains a worthwhile read in spite of typed, flat, and cardboard caricatures of the players in the story. The sometimes didactic discussion of `doing the right thing' is timeless and worth consideration by any generation of readers. The tension of what is right versus what is good in Arrowsmith's science and medical profession can be teased and tested beyond that parochial domain. Every reader's battle with that tension will find a thorough airing of important considerations for their own lives through Arrowsmith's saga."
2,No Audio CD,"This item appeared in the description to include an audio CD for listening comprehension, but I received no CD. The book is in good condition."
4,Even the Stars Look Lonesome by Maya Angelou,I was very satisfied with my purchase of this book and also with the delivery.
5,In appreciation....,"This is not the first time I've read this book, but it's been many years and I am a different person than when I read it last, so it was almost new to me. Reading Even the Stars Look Lonesome feels like being gifted with wisdom from a treasured elder. One story in this collection about one of Dr. Angelou's marriages that ended, particularly sticks with me. Also, the love with which she writes of her own mother is so very poignant. Her relentlessness in looking at her own truth and the truth of our nation's history will forever be an inspiration to me. I think it was a very good idea to start the year off reading Dr. Angelou."
3,Poster,"the poster came in about a week, but when i got it there was a crease going up and down the right side but other than that it was ok"
3,Rachael Squires's Review,The film was really good but the picture quality was quite poor. Maybe they should've put a bit more digital techology into the picture.
1,Very disappointing,"Saunders-Garcia combo doesn't work. Bass work, I'm guessin' by Phil Lesh, is the highlight."
1,Discolors Quickly and Badly,"Mine discolored on first use, and is now barely readable. How dumb is that, for an OVEN thermometer to discolor from heat??? It looks like there was some liquid or something on the inside because the discoloration is splotchy, and I don't otherwise know why steel would immediately discolor. It is now virtually impossible to read while in the oven (maybe that's why they use the oil reservoir, so you have time to yank it out of your oven to actually read it)."
1,Very difficult to read in F,"I was very disappointed with this product. The picture shows only F, but describes C also, which is fine.The problem is that the C in on the inside of the dial and F is on the outside which is under the rim of the thermometer.Were I to bother to read it anymore, I would have to get down on my knees with a flashlight, and this is with theoven door open. It doesn't match my old thermometer in degree reading, so I still don't know how hot my ovenis running."
4,"Good, but not what I needed","I was looking for natural sounds to play on headphones to make the sounds of cubicle city at work go away. For me, the worst conversations at work aren't those that are too loud or even held at normal sound levels. Instead, the worst are the whispered conversations. I don't want to hear what my co-workers don't want me to hear. In an effort not to intrude on their privacy, I try not to listen. The harder I try not to listen, the more each whispered syllable seems to go into my head. Even if I don't hear well enough to pick up more than a word out of every ten or twenty, the whispering destroys my concentration. I needed something to drown out everything.This CD has nice sounds. If I wanted something to simulate nature, this one would be good. Unfortunately, the simulation includes simulation of quiet moments, and those moments would let the sounds of the cubicles back into my head. If that's not a problem for your needs, you'll like this CD."
3,Multi-Disciplinary Explanations of Love,"Montagu edits this volume of essays on love, written by a variety of scientists, physicians, and a theologian in the early 1950's. Among the authors are Abraham Maslow, Pitirim A. Sorokin, and James Luther Adams. The editor writes that these essays find their purpose in ""helping to liberate the love that is within, to enable more people to understand, feel, and enjoy the great power that is within them, the need which they have to give and receive love"" (v). Montagu believes that inquiring into the various meanings of love may give clues for understanding love and the capacity to express love more adequately."
5,a story of the early pioneers of Tasmania,"Just off the continent of Australia lies the island of Tasmania. It was to this pleasant land in the year 1840 that Jan Halifax brought his lovely young bride, Harriat Bracken. Theirs had been a quick and stormy courtship. Overriding the restrictions of the conventional clergyman'. family into which the beautiful Harriat had been born, Jan wooed her and carried her away to face with him the adventures of Van Dieman's Land, as Tasmania was then called. She was equipped with no knowledge of what lay before her, but she loved her husband. That was enough. Wild Orchard is the story of how they strive to wrench a home out of the stubborn, discouraging ""bush"", and establish the name Halifax gloriously and solidly--in Island history. Fire swept away their promised house but friendly neighbors and willing workmen helped them build again. Ex-convicts were their servants, and the lawlessness of a raw country sometimes frightened the gently bred Harriat.78"
2,A long way from his best,"I am generally a fan of the various Griffin series, but I just can't like this book. It's the first Griffin book I wasn't really eager to get back to reading.I think my biggest problem is the fragmented way that two stories are being told. We get a few pages each in different locations telling what's happening on an operation in Europe from several viewpoints. That's fine and somewhat normal for Griffin. The problem is that these snippets are also interspersed with some reports on what's happening on a different operation in the Pacific. With minor exceptions, the only connection is that they are occurring at the same time. Neither of them depends on the other in any way that I could see. This organization both detracts from the flow and reduces the space which could have been spent on either operation.It also seems that this series isn't as well developed as The Corps and Brotherhood of War."
5,Excellent series of essays on Aquinas.,Great reference book. It is a pity that it is so difficult to obtain a copy. I purchased the book when I was studying Aquinas and the Book of Job. Several essays cover the topic of God's Providence. Good cross sections of opinions expressed. Excellent reference source.
3,Good deal if cheaper,"I bought this item from another site and paid much less so it was a good deal for the money but its not a great NAS. SimpleTech is liquidating this model so that they can release a new version with the iShare feature found on the 500GB models. The RAM seems to very on different units. Some have 32MB some have 64MB. It ships with an old 1.02 firmware. If you hunt around the net you can find the 1.09 version, which supports powering down the drive. Out of the box the drive will spin forever; you have to configure it to spin down after a timeout. Version 1.10 supports iShare but SimpleTech won't release the new firmware to the purchasers of other units. If you hunt around, you can find a modified version of the 1.07 firmware that lets you telnet into the device. Its sharing is basic but it works on Windows, OSX, and Linux. It has no support for FTP and has a web interface that doesn't work very well."
5,"For the hip hoppers, and chic hipsters alike.","Pepe Deluxe craft beautiful hip hop inspired fusion with a touch of big beat and a dash of European electronica. I love hearing Europeans' interpretations of traditionally American music. Hip Hop has remained a very localized style of music, having been only touched upon by foreign musicians (i.e. mc solaar, dj krush for example). Pepe Deluxe, a trio of producers/DJs, are very much in touch with hip hop culture. Maybe TOO in touch at some points! Really, the skills are undeniably incredible, and the musicianship is top notch. DJ Slow, one of the three, is a European DMC champion and an amazing one at that! A track of his was featured on part 2 of the ""Return of the DJ"" series on Bomb Hip Hop Records. I highly recommend this album to hip hop purists and club goers alike. Its THAT good."
5,Bad kittiy,I love this cd but i think that vol.1 was better! my best friend from salt lake showed me this cd and now i hav all the cds! and every one should have it to!!!billie jo
1,what happened?,"dont know why but her material has gotten progressively worse over time. this was downright painful to listen to. I was embarrassed for her. If you make the mistake of buying this, you will hate this garbage. Not only did i order the dvd but i downloaded it from itunes as well. The copy on itunes will be deleted and the dvd will be re-gifted. Thank God I didn't take the plastic off."
2,Very average,"This CD sounds quite bad IMO. Very unrealistic - and closer to synthesized sound than the real thing. If this was recorded on real beaches, the recording engineer messed up badly. Having said that, I guess its fine a (distant) background sound, but if you really want the relaxation benefits, spring for something better."
3,I love Nature Sounds,"I love Nature Sounds, especially the Ocean!I also have the Sounds of Nature Series by Chuck Plaisance. His version ofOCEAN WAVES (Sounds of Nature Series)is supberb. 3-D sound and excellent quality. I like the entire Sounds of Nature Series. On the Sampler you can hear excerpts from all 20 albums.Sounds of Nature Sampler."
2,another budget release for Flock of Seagulls...,"Well, I bought this one because there's one song from the ""Story of a Young Heart"" LP, which has still never been released on CD, and that song is Never Again (The Dancer). All other songs have shown up on various Flock of Seagulls collections. This is the track listing:1. I Ran2. Space Age Love Song3. Telecommunication4. You Can Run5. What Am I Supposed to Do6. The Traveller7. Never Again8. Electrics9. Over my Head10. The EndIf they'd just release that final album on CD, we wouldn't need all these stray hits collections floating around..."
2,Not enough words,"If you have a good professor to guide your through, this book may be ok. If you're on your own - forget about it."
5,Glee Season 3,This season was excellent. It was funny and kept me laughing throughout the whole thing. I really do like the fact that the musicals that are done here are from all different genres. I adore this show.
5,Love Glee,"One of my favorite shows - amazing music, so funny and touching all at the same time! Amazon Instant Streaming is the perfect way to watch it!"
4,Michael,"Michael was a great episode. I'm truly a fan of Glee. It showed very clear, and you were able to fast forward or rewind easily."
3,Better than the first two...,"The story was a bit tighter this episode than the last two...and the negative attention wasn't as strong. As a grade, I say C...just average. The fun the first two seasons provided has not been evident this season. The only promise is the new dancer with the dark hair...was beside Mike Chang during his solo...this guy has the same dance energy that Brittney S has...I hope he returns. As for the acting, there isn't much. Mr S looks so forced...the bright acting spot was Emma. I may give one or two more episodes a try before I stop viewing."
3,Of Silent Springs and Loudly Prophecies,"With this comedy masterpiece, Rachel Carson launched a thorough and successful assault on pesticides commonly used in agriculture. After nearly 45 years, DDT is no longer used. Every organism on the planet has what was once considered a lethal quantity of it in its cells and the human ones are still alive to whine about the worms in their raspberries.Should you read this book? Yes. It's a thought-provoking indictment, and, like The Jungle 60 years before it, helped shape the world in which we now live. I only wish that all you young, unshaven tree-huggers would understand that panic-peddling is a business just like everything else. Some want to sell you books, others ""organic"" fruit and others still want to ride panic where politics failed them like a certain secretary of vice presidency or whatever it was Gore did in the 90s."
1,Awful,"If you want to be in the worst mood you've ever been in for no reason at all, I highly suggest reading this book."
3,Silent Spring,This book was okay. It would be great for outdoors people. Great description on the spring setting and wildlife that comes out in it.
3,Not what it's hyped up to be,"I'm sorry but I have to do this. Silent Spring is not the masterpiece that everyone says it is. Yes it might be considered revolutionary FOR THE TIME but reading it today seems compeltely pointless.Silent Spring is one of the most repetative books I've ever read. The only part where it was interesting was when she went off topic to explain the inner workings of the cell. All 300 pages could literally have been summed up on the front and back of a single sheet of paper. In this day and age, there ARE better ways of becomming aware of polution than putting so much time into such an outdated book.The entire book is about DDT and how it affects the planet. The point that DDT and other chemicles will turn up in unforseen places if dumped somewhere is hammered into the reader thoughout the whole book. And that's really all there is to say. If you want to learn about polution, go to a more recent and refined resorce."
1,Way too bias,"This review will be short, this book presents a one sided argument in a completely emotional manner rather than a factual and scientific manner."
2,didn't like it,"I have bought used book in good condition before , but it was not like others, it is a wavy book, even it was so before mailing or it became so during the mailing process, I didn't like that!"
2,"Good Message, but very redundant","The book starts out well enough and gets the point across. Pesticide use is causing a lot more problems that it is solving. That's great it really is, but every chapter sticks to the same formula and it became increasingly difficult to pick up the book. If it weren't for the fact that it was required reading for my American History class, I would have never finished it."
3,NN,The watch works fine but the band is wider than I expected so it is not as comfortable as is would like and it looks a bit clunky but it is easy to read and set. The blue is VERY blue so it is has a very sporty feel and less of an everyday look.
3,Nice for just a watch,But the buttons are difficult to push & I'll be darned if I can figure out the stopwatch feature. I have had many Timex Iron man watches and never had to read the manual. This one is more tricky. It does look nice and the price was right.
3,TIMEX WATCH..TAKE A GOOD LOOK BEFORE BUYING,"tHIS tIMEX WAS WAS JUST OK. iT LOOKS KIND OF BOYISH ON A WOMANS WRIST. i FOUND THE SET-UP HARD TO DO DESPITE THE CONFUSING DIRECTIONS. i ALSO COULD NOT FIND HOW TO SHUT OFF THE WATCH FROM BEEPING EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR. mY HUSBAND IS A LIGHT SLEEPER, SO i HAVVE TO BURY THE WATCH IN A DRAWER FILLED WITH CLOTHING TO MUTE THE BEEPING EVERY HOUR.iT DOES FIT FINE, AND IT DOES HOLD UP TO BEING UNDER WATER, BUT THESE 2 COMMENTS ARE THE ONLY POSTIVE THINGS i CAN SAY ABOUT THIS TIMEX.LOOK BEFORE BUYING PLEASE!PAM FROM CALIFORNIA"
3,Nice watch but it's not Unisex!,This is a nice looking watch and very functional but there is nothing Unisex about it. This is a Woman's watch. The 1st day I wore it to work bunch of my co-workers started making fun of me for wearing a woman's watch. So I never wore it again!
5,A great introduction to Asian philosophy,"This 1969 sourcebook is the culmination of a Neo-Confucian researcher's work. The late author's philosophical leanings do not necessarily detract from its authority because he's relatively forthright about his opinions. Chan's work is commonly cited not only in the West but also in Taiwan and Hong Kong, despite the fact that wave after wave of archeological findings have illuminated these texts since this book's publication. The cloth edition of Laozi found in Mawangdui, Changsha in 1974 redefined Confucian scholarship, for instance.This work is probably the best introduction to Chinese--indeed, Asian--philosophy I can think of. For more intensive research I like the carefully annotated originals from the Hong Kong series Zhonghua Shuju ([...]). They are conveniently organized and offer a wider variety of perspectives."
4,Philosophy Book,This book is listed in several later works as a source. Have gone through a few pages and have found it helpful.
2,Paradise County,This is the first work of Karen Robard that I have been disappointed in. The characters were lacking something. I could not finish this book. I have enjoyed most of her works.
1,Horrified and Disgusted,"If I could give this less than one star, I would! I usually love Karen Robards' books. I have several of her books that I reread at least once a year. This one is horrifying! When I got to the villian pouring kerosene on a dog in preparation to set him on fire, I threw the book across the room. Two weeks later, I ripped the book apart and fed it into my new cross-cut shredder. I love books and this is the first and only book I've ever felt compelled to destroy so no one else had to read it. If I want something disgusting enough to give me nightmares, I'll read true-crime books or watch the news. Reading books is supposed to be an enjoyable escape, not something that you spend weeks trying to get out of your head every time you close your eyes. Especially disappointing is when the book is written by one of your favorite authors and it's supposed to be ""romance."" My advice: If you love animals and hate needless torture and cruelty, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
3,Not her best.,"Since the story is a mixture of espionage and romance, a lot of names are revealed. I had to reread the passages in order to keep track of them. So this is not something you'd want to read in bed. Damien and Emma are the faint reminiscences of what Ryman's other characters have been. However, the dialogues are too played out, and the exposition is a bit shaky. I still don't get the love-hate relationship between them. But overall, Ryman's curry-like description will work like magic."
3,Great Book But No Answers,"This book was to be a newer version of a Numbers Power book that we wore out. In many ways it seems to be just that but there are no answers to the problems in the book. To check someones work we need to do the problems ourselves to make sure the student's work is correct. Yes, it may be a good exercise for the tutor but it is very time consuming."
2,Could be better !,"I was a bit dissapointed when I received this book.In text it is absolutely great : a lot of detail in the different stories, and no ""secrets"" are held back.But, the quality of the book, and certainly the pictures, are very poor quality : it looks like they are black and white copies of copies of pictures.So : if they can add color pictures in this book (and a lot more of tem), then even with a higher price for it, makes it a better read."
4,"Buy it, Use it, Love it","I first used this book in a school in Moldova where the program was based on the intergrated skills approach. Students wanted grammar and the administration wanted communication. This book met both of those requirements excellently.Because of the nature of the activities, they can be used by students at various levels with equal enjoyment.The book is arranged by particular grammar structures which makes it easy to choose the activity most appropriate for your instructional goals during that class.This is one of those ""living on an island teaching EFL"" books that you don't want to be without."
5,Takes care of ice,"Got this product for my wife before Christmas. When we got home from a three-week vacation, one of our cars was covered in New England January ice. So I was able to fully test this product. It did make my life easier. It took me a couple of minutes to blast through as thick as 1-1.5"" of ice buildup on the front and back windshield. The ice scraper came out intact of the fierce battle. It's not effort free but it definitely does go hard at work for you and performs much better than a regular scraper."
3,Good 2nd scraper for thick ice,"I've had one of these for four or five years. It's very effective on thick, tough ice. It will penetrate smooth ice which other scrapers hardly scratch. After severe use, the edges haven't nicked. But as others have noted, it isn't very sharp and it doesn't conform to curved glass, so it doesn't do well with thin layers of frost. Suggestion: keep one of these in your closet to pull out when there's an ice storm, but don't rely on it as your only scraper. (And do keep in in your closet, not your trunk, because it's most valuable after ice storms which make car trunks and doors inoperable.)"
2,Not as helpful as it looks,"I got one of these for Christmas a couple years ago, and it was disappointing. It works pretty well on heavy ice, but on the normal everyday frost it wasn't as good as the average scraper. I was also hoping for a little more durability from the cost of the item, but it really only lasted a season for me before it didn't scrape cleanly. I didn't buy another one and I'm back to just buying a cheap scraper every season."
2,history buff,"The author could have added so many details that were factual and actual events and, yet, were so compelling and riveting. This book lacked substance and depth. You don't really experience the life or the personal conflicts that played out in the French court. It was also too sympathetic to Marie Antoinette and highly unbelievable. There were also so many missing pieces that could have explained more clearly what led up to the revolution. I know this is a work of fiction but the true historical events and figures that took place were much more interesting than all the fictional events and characters the author created."
3,The Diary of a Queen,"I read through some of the reviews here before I began reading this book and was, frankly, quite hesitant. As far as some of the simplistic language, I think the author was trying to catch the true essence of Marie Antoinette. She was not a highly educated girl and so wouldn't be writing long, labrious sentences. She also was a very sheltered and naive girl, even selfish. However, we have to remember the times and the possibility that if any other queen had been on the throne, they would have probably lost their head as well.I have 2 main objections to this book: 1) I really would have rather had a more historical fictionalized version of this book as opposed to a full diary account and 2) Amelie. She is the most crude, horrible, inhumane person I have ever encountered in literature (OK, a little drastic). I would have loved for someone to have shot her or stabbed her before Marie was dragged back to her cell."
2,The Hidden Diary lost me...,"I couldn't finish The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette by Carolly Erickson. I found myself skimming and not feeling I was missing anything. It was too simplistic in tone and content for the immense complexity of the French queen's life. As she aged, her diary didn't reflect sufficient corresponding maturity. It would a good young adult fictional biography, but it does include some mild sexual activity for parents to be aware of as what might be age appropriate for their child.I've read Ms. Erickson's non-fiction, so I was disappointed in this, her first novel. I found Erickson's non-fiction biography of Marie Antoinette more satisfying. It read like a novel, was more factual, and added depth to Marie's character."
4,still a great product,"Publisher is still a great work horse for creative publications -- new version is just a tad cumbersome -- and, at the same time, somewhat easier. Go figure. In addition to the church newsletter and various graphic projects, I actually design many of my quilts with Publisher! It's so easy to manipulate graphic images and text selections."
1,Havahart Mouse Trap,Difficult to set the trap; too small to get hand in to put food on tray. I would not recommend using this trap.
5,Chipmunks,"I left the Havahart cage outside in my garden, and in a matter of 2 weeks it caught 3 chipmunks. They were destroying my garden. Finally it is chipmunk free. I placed a piece of apple in the trap and that did it."
5,great catch,Excellent product. Every time it's set properly it delivers. Proves that there's more to Littiz than chocolate!
2,Cage Trap for Mice and Rats,I ordered the havahart 1020 Two Door Cage to hopefully trap rats that were under my shed. Unfortunately cage is too small for rats. Cage was easy to put together and would work fine for mice. Fortunately rats are gone (outdoor cats and or raccoon paid a visit I guess)
4,Worth the price,"Trigger works well, though can be touchy to set-up. Slathering a bit of peanut butter on the trigger plate works well. Seems to have caught a few mice in a few days. Make sure to take the little guys far far away so they don't come back. Even more important with chipmunks, etc.Overall worth the price considering it is reusable and able to safely transport the trapped animal to a new home."
3,Didn't pass the comparison test,"I previously rated the Kness Tip Trap, so there is more info.there. This trap looks good and should work, but it didn't catch any mice. Setting the trap doors is a little tricky."
5,Havahart 1020 Live animal Two - Door Mouse Cage trap,"This trap is very good caught many mice still using it, mice cannot damage it. Would recomend buying it. Can use one door or two."
3,small size defeats gravity,Because of its small size the closing mechanism doesn't work as well as the larger size traps. I experienced varmits eating the food and not activating the release mechanism. Or maybe I didn't load it correctly.
4,works well,"Works well, have trapped several mice and relocted them . I would recommend to anyone who wants to avoid killing the cute little creatures."
3,Live Animal Two Door Mouse Cage Trap,"Can't seem to catch too many rodents with this trap. Some of the little critters are captured, some seem to escape."
1,Too Small/Don't Waste Your Time and Money,"Though the larger Havahart traps may work, this one is simply too small to get the bait on the tray and for the trap to stay set without accidentally tripping. We've tried using this on multiple occasions to no avail. I strongly recommend using the old fashioned tried and true traps. If you catch field mice indoors with these traps and then set them free outdoors in the winter, they die and slow and painful death. With the traditional bait and kill traps, at least it's a quick demise..."
1,Havahart Mouse Trap,We could not get the doors to stay open. Any amount of vibration closes them. And I just had to buy 2 of them.
3,Made in China,"I haven't used this trap, just received it. However, I was sad to find it was made in China. I had assumed Havahart was USA.I gave it a three because you have to give a rating to make a review, and I did not want to give high or low numbers for something I have not tried. I would give a five for disappointmentI have bought two other traps. The Kness Tip-Trap 109-0-001 Live Capture Mouse Trap is marked Kness Mfg Co, Inc, Albia, Iowa U.S.A.. The Smart Mouse Trap. a green plastic house, is made in Mexico.I just set a Tip Trap. I will try The Smart Mouse Trap in my oven (made unusable since mice made a nest in the wall insulation) as soon as I get the proper bait.I will be sending back the Havahart. They eat dogs and cats in China. I draw the line at buying 'humane' products from thereUpdated 12-12-11 I caught 23 mice in three weeks with the Tip Trap. Then I adopted 2 wonderful cats from the humane society, and the mice have moved on"
1,HARD TO SET,"These traps are hard to set, if you do get them set chances are they will go off when your placing them on the floor."
3,"Frustrating first set up, but eventually functional.","This product does what it is made for, after some slight realigning of the trigger mechanism. I ordered six units and five of them required the wire that leads to the bait tray to be bent one way or another in order to prevent the trap from being either incapable of triggering or from triggering within seconds of placing it. The bait must also be balanced on a specific side of the tray in order to make the trap work at all. The U shaped door locks have a slight tendency to fall off which renders the trap useless. So far I've caught nineteen mice so they work fairly well and are certainly reusable but very frustrating to set up the first time, though subsequent times are not nearly as frustrating."
3,"Dented product, great service","We ordered two live mouse traps. One of them arrived in great shape. The other was dented badly, completely unusable. This did not happen in shipping as the boxes (both the Amazon box and the smaller Havahart box) were in perfect shape. Luckily, when we got on the website we found that it was extremely easy to return the dented trap and a replacement trap arrived very quickly."
1,who invented this piece of junk!!!,Seriously does this even work???This piece of junk has a two rods attach to each door going over each other. So principle is the mouse will shake the cage and the rods will close the door. But its extremely poor design. Locking mechanism is super hard to set. Sometimes it either gets stuck and doesn't close and sometimes it just closes by wind blow. Wasted my money on this piece of junk.
4,"Sizes run small, but they are GREAT footwear","I ordered these for a scout backpacking trip, they are lightweight, and comfortable. I never thought I would wear these besides the trip, but I found myself wearing them around the house, they are very comfortable."
5,"~ ~ ~ If you're looking for RELAXING music, I cannot recommend this CD enough!! ~ ~ ~","I can't decide which of these CDs I like better: Deuter's Wind & Mountain or Deuter's Earth Blue. When I was pregnant, I was looking for relaxing music to labor to and I found Deuter's music at Amazon.com. I am SOOOOO glad that I found his music, because now whenever I hear those soothing sounds I am immediately taken back to those precious first days with my beautiful daughter. We played these CDs non-stop the following days in the hospital while I recovered and when the doctor came in the room, he said to me, ""This is the most relaxing hospital room I've ever been in. I don't want to leave!""Lately I've taken to playing them in the car. I've found them to be a wonderful way to have an enjoyable relaxing trip. What a great way to fight stressful TRAFFIC! I can't recommend these CDs enough. I'm on Amazon tonight looking for more to add to my ""Wish List."""
1,False presented item,"I'd give it 0 star if possibleIt is TK32A, not TK32 as stated in the title.Returned"
4,Bang or your buck.,"I've always thought Marilyn Manson was pretty good band but didn't know what CD to get. This was a good one to start with. Great songs by a great band. 17 songs, they pretty much put as much music on there for you as possible. I highly recommend getting this. Plus, the artwork is pretty cool too. It had all my favorites plus a few I didn't know. Check it out, you wont be dissappointed."
4,Mind Numbing Rock Music,"Manson proves he is very talented. Just listening to his cd is Mind numbing. Good Solid rock music, with great covers and lots of meaning behind the lyrics. Just sit back and actually listen to what he is saying in his music, and you will understand how his mind works."
1,IF YOU LOVE {MARILYN MANSON}-THEN YOU WILL /LOVE/ THESE GROUPS!,"IF YOU ""LOVE MARIYLN MANSON""-THEN CHECK OUT THESE GROUP'S AND SINGERS:[VANILLA ICE]-[M.C.HAMMER]-[JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE]-[WILL SMITH]-[BRITNEY SPEARS]-[PINK]-[BACKSTREET BOYS]-[N`SYNC]-[MANDY MOORE]-[JESSICA SIMPSON]-[98 DEGRESS][BECAUSE {MARILYN MANSON} IS A ""JOKE"" AND A ""FAKE"" LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I MENTIONED]!I ALWAYS SAY TO PEOPLE IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT MARILYN MANSON'SHOUSE IN BEVERLY HILLS & AND HIS 100,000 CAR'S. YOU WOULD THEN KNOW IS A ""RICH CLOWN"" TRYING TO ""FOOL PEOPLE"" HE IS A ONE OF A KIND HARD-CORE SINGER![MONEY WILL CHANGE PEOPLE NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE]!(NEW YORK,NEW YORK)"
2,Distinct lack of good Manson...,"This CD makes a better coaster. All it has are:the worst songs on Holywoodsome songs from Grotesque (which are all bad)two of the few bad songs off of Antichrist Superstar (Tourniquet's good, though)It's only worth buying for Long Hard Road Out of Hell and Tainted Love. Not necessarily because they're good, but because I can't find them anywhere else.Manson hasn't made a good heavy song since Portrait of an American Family. Lest We Forget doesn't have Dogma, Misery Machine, it doesn't even have Cake And Sodomy. At least it has Get Your Gunn and Lunchbox, which are okay.In summary: Don't buy this, buy Portrait of an American Family to rock, and either Antichrist Superstar or Holywood to get some depressing songs."
4,"suspense,drama and exciting!","okay, even though this movie didn't do so well, and probably not a lot of people saw it, and it went out of print, i thought it was ""GREAT"" everyone who is anyone should check this out!!!"
2,Clunky,"This was purchased primarily for the calendar function and address book. It is slow, requires more key strokes and requires that my Dell Inspiron 1100 have additional RAM. It will not do certain functions necessary to preserve an accurate record of appointments when the appt. is recurring and I want to edit one or more of the series. It restores all previous edits to the original series status, deleting any individual appt. edits. It also deletes records older than six months according to what colleagues have said. BUT, it hasn't locked up my PC like the very user friendly Palm OS did, resulting in whole days worth of lost scheduling."
4,MS Outlook 2007,"Amazon shipped this item a few days before it was due. The software was new, unopened and worked exactly as advertised. It was also quite a bit cheaper than retail."
4,"Pretty, pretty good.","It does just everything I need a personal info manager to do. Deal with e-mails, keep a calendar, a journal (captain's log?), Post It style comments, and a contacts list. The e-mail portion (most important piece) can delay messages sent and create HTML letters. What it can't seem to do is ""on the fly"" autospelling.The next biggest drawback is the price. At $100 it's way overpriced for a standalone portion of Microsoft Office. In fact, if Microsoft priced it at $50-$60 more people would have it installed on their PCs. I thought selling the product was the point of this capitalism thing."
3,PROBLEMS!,"Oh my gosh what a pain in the arse. It says on installation that there's an option to keep all of your older versions of Office software but it apparently DELETES Microsoft Outlook XP Pro entirely. This was the free trial software from Microsoft's website.This wouldn't be so much of a problem except that now I can't create new emails or reply to emails. I've been on hold with Microsoft Customer Support and was misrouted to support for Excel so I just wasted nearly 45 minutes.Microsoft is a DISASTER. Can't live with em, can't live without em.I actually purchased Outlook 2007 from amazon.com but I'm wondering if it was a mistake...Oh, and if you have a dual-monitor system the new Office 2007 software might not work with some of the extremely practical software features of your video card (switch monitor, single-monitor maximize etc.)."
3,Microsoft office 2997,"I like the software but there are aspects of it that I was not aware of--like needing a special internet service in order to use all the features.It would have been nice to have had this pointed out in the reviews--if it was there, I never saw it."
4,MS Outlook 2007,"I upgraded from Office 2003 to Office Home 7 Student 2007 to take advantage of newer PowerPoint features. I discovered that the new office didn't include Outlook. When I tried to install Office 2007, it failed, as it couldn't find a certain file. Checking with MS, it turns out that that file was in use by Outlook 2003. So in order to do the upgrade, I had to upgrade to Outlook 2007. Fortunately, I was able to buy both upgrade packages at below the Office Professional 2007 price.Having said all that, I installed both packages without a problem. I found Outlook 2007 to have the same functionality as 2003, but presented on screen more efficiently and attractively. I now can see all items on one screen - messages with auto preview, calendar, to do list, etc. The colors assigned to different items also make what's on the monitor much more interesting.Bottom line on my expectations:Functionality is a meetsApprarance/format is an exceeds."
2,Wasted Time,"Have constant problems with this product. It will not close - sends error messages but problems are not corrected. More often than not when you imput data or try to access information you get the message ""not responding."" I'm just glad the developers of this product were not responsible for developing critical hospital patient care programs as most patients would have died a long time ago."
1,Disappointed to the Extreme,"I cannot ereally rate the product, because I never recieved it. After more than six weeks of waiting I received an email notfying me that I would be rebated the amount of the item less shipping since I had sent it back. Want to bet if I'll ever use Amazon again. Don't hold your breath!!!"
1,Stick with 2003,"Horrible. I recently upgraded from Outlook 2003. I never had a problem with 2003. Outlook 2007 freezes 90% of the time I use it, locks up on downloading email, and frequently has to start in ""safe"" mode because it claims it was not shut down properly. Tremendous waste of time.are the features better than 2003? I don't think so. Although I can't really say for sure --- I have such a hard time using it that I haven't had the chance to explore the new features. I do know that it is much more difficult to assign categories to calendar entries, and the shortcut keys are not the same.A quick internet search shows that this is common. I recommend sticking with 2003 as long as you can. It's easier to use, and more stable."
2,Locked in Concrete,"Getting the case opened to access the Outlook CD requires a sledge and a strong arm.Furthermore, the Microsoft product code is glued to the case, so you better save the parts"
3,The Lhasa Apso: An owner's guide,I found the book helpful. I would have liked more on an adult dog. My dog is a 2 1/2 year old Shelter dog. And I am a first time dog owner.
3,"White noise, yes, but more like static than rain","Read the reviews and hoped for the best, but found that much of the ""rain"" in this recording does indeed sound more like static than the pleasant drip of a spring rain. Nevertheless, it's still relaxing as the thunder sounds fairly authentic, and the bird and animal sounds are nice. I suppose mother nature just can't be replicated authentically!"
1,dont work,"The glasses only change the color of the object- from white to yellow ,but you can't see cleaner and sharper.It didn't work for me.I returned them."
4,good for the gym,Fits my small arms. Access to wheel. Have no plans for moving in and out of holder. Perfect for my needs.
5,PERFECT!,"I was looking for a case and armband combo, and this is it! The case lets me carry it around safely and when i feel like going to the gym i can just strap the armband on without removing my ipod. The case is rubbery and will prevent scratches and probably absorb minor shocks if it falls. The strap fits my little arms, doesn't hurt, and allows for any type of exercise. It'd easily fit some big arms as well.A screen protector came with this, though, which wasn't listed in the product description. I guess that's good! I'm not taking off any stars for it then, since it was a bonus, but honestly it DIDN'T WORK. The edges of the screen protector are squared instead of rounded like the ipod screen, so there were air bubbles in each corner when i applied it.Buy this!! :)"
2,"Ehh, nothing to write home about","I purchased this for a really cheap price, which is the only reason I give this thing any stars at all. The sticky plastic cover that it came with to cover the LCD screen and touch wheel bubbles and looks awful. The case itself is fine, however the band that goes around it is an awkward, bulky belt. If you don't care about aesthetics, it does the job, but unfortunately makes your $300 ipod look like you picked it out of a garbage heap."
2,Not the best option for active people,"This product says ""sport"" in the title, but it really isn't designed for use while being very active. I run on a treadmill at the gym and the sleeve leaves the Ipod far too floppy on my arm. It really bounces all over the place and becomes an annoyance. The quality of the sleeve's parts are great, but the design is poor. If you ride a bike or are only lifting weights it will do the trick, but I would avoid it if you are doing anything more."
3,You get what you pay for,This silicone case wasnt exactly what i was looking for but nevertheless gets the job done. It is kind of cheap and leaves the some of the ipod exposed such as the screen and part of the back. The armband works fairly well and was a lot more comfortable than expected. I was trying to get a bargain to protect my ipod by purchasing this product but now i realize I should have just paid the extra ten bucks and gotten a quality product. oh well...
3,It's ok.,"I guess this gets the job done, but I didn't like that the screen cover was a separate piece of plastic that goes on the screen and that the whole thing has to stretch over the iPod. The arm band is ok - kind of wide though.It's also a bit thick so I cannot attach my microphone to my iPod when this rubber cover is in place.It's ok, and it will help to protect my iPod - just realize that it is a rubber case that you stretch over the iPod and that the 'screen cover' is a separate piece of plastic that sticks to your screen."
2,Honey In the Horn,"I ordered this for my book club and it took over 3 weeks to receive it, consequently didn't make the book club review. The story is interesting, especially for those familiar with the NW. Does drag on but descriptions are humorous and vivid."
5,It's always nice to have a battery when you want one,"I have always used Energizer and they have never let me down. Ordering these in a 2 pack of 16 count means you will have to do the remote battery shuffle when one set dies. Stick these away somewhere out of the way and you will most likely always have them available to you. I find myself using more and more batteries, so it is always nice to have a bit of a stockpile."
2,Batteries from Amazon?,"I bought these because it looked like I was getting a good deal. When they got here, I noticed they are a couple years old. Disappointing because I bought these for the shelf life."
4,Good Batteries,What can I say energizer batteries kick but they last a long time and if you recharge them (special charger available on amazon) they will last longer. For me it was the great price that got me.
4,They work well,"This is a review of the D-size battery packI bought these for a flashlight. They work decently, but the flashlight doesn't seem as bright as it did with the previous set of batteries. Unfortunately the old batteries got tossed before I got to see what kind they were. Anyway, these batteries do work and the flashlight is working again, it just seems slightly dimmer than it was.Not sure yet how long they'll last, but that's why I got an 8-pack! They do so far seem to be holding up well for use in a flashlight that gets used briefly on a daily basis.Bottom-line: I don't have many devices that require a D battery, but I am glad to have these on hand for when I do need them. If you need a pack of D batteries on hand, grab these."
3,Open packaging,"Sold as ""new"". Both battery packages had been opened and resealed in seran. Batteries tested as charged, but still raises questionsOn the other hand, for the price I can't complain"
4,Basic D batteries,I bought these for 2012 purposes or just power outages. These are probably one of the more versatile batteries and you can use them in many ways if you know how. I am probably gonna use them for back up for my lanterns but they seem great and you are getting quality batteries from energizer.
1,Stale,"The batteries seemed to be old or stale. They didn't last very long at all. I used them in my trail camera, which normally is pretty easy on batteries but these were down to 2 bars after a week. I get better results from dollar store brands. Disappointed."
2,"""Brand New"" Batteries Leak","The package came with a few leaking batteries (pictures uploaded), and what first comes to my mind is that they have been in that package for a long time. I didn't get a chance to test the remaining batteries. The appearance is ok, but I'm not so sure about their quality once many batteries were covered by a white powder and some viscous liquid (I presumed is the battery acid leak). Lesson learned, next time I'll consider getting fresh batteries at a local store, where you can check expiration date, package and batteries conditions, etc before you buy it."
2,Batteries,"After I ordered these I found that a previous order had batteries that were essentially ""dead"". Too late to stop this one, althought they were fine. But why buy batteries I have to check individually every time. Not worth the trouble."
2,Great concept - Weak treatment.,"Okay, here's the deal. I'm looking for a great way to study for the bar. A thirty or sixty day cruise sounded like a great option. I wouldn't buy it again though.Although this is a fairly entertaining read, It's a bit pricey - it's privately published so you're probably not going to find it at your local bookstore. I was disappointed by its size, scope, and overall treatment of the subject.Best bet: if you happen to see this book at a garage sale - pick it up. Don't pay full price - you'll be disappointed."
4,Useful,"This text book has been very useful and necessary in order to complete quizzes etc associated with the class. I would recommend this book to anyone involved in any form of social work, including the medical field."
1,Dreadful,"Word 2007 is a perfect example of why you shouldn't try to fix something that was never broken. Instead of improving Word, they made it ugly and just plain annoying. An experienced user can figure out how to use it...but the hunting and searching for functions that used to be a snap to find is a frustrating, time-consuming waste. The toolbar is now a ""ribbon"" cluttered with icons instead of quick, simple pull-down menus. I wish I'd done more research, and I'd have ordered an older version of Word with my new laptop. THIS SYSTEM SUCKS."
1,Not for business use!,"The license prevents you from using this product for any commercial use, even non-profit business use. Do not buy this product if you have any intention of ever using it to make money."
3,Not satisfied with Amazon,"I recently ordered Microsoft Word and Home from Amazon. My intent was to review the product by clicking the ""one click"" order option. To my surprise, instead the item was ordered and sent without varification if that is what I wanted to do.Actually, I wanted to order the Office package that includes other programs from Microsoft for only about $20 more, but Amazon would not allow me to change or cancel the order within one hour after I clicked. BE CAREFUL, AMAZON HAS DESIGNED THIS FEATURE SO YOU CAN'T UNDO IT !!!!This is also a non returnable item !!!!I am not happy with Amazon, although the software is excellent, I did not intend to order just the Word version and would have gladly paid the difference to get three more Microsoft programs.Following the Amazon links for returning, they suggest I resell the item they hadn't even shipped yet!!!I use many different on line ordering systems, but have never had a bad experience like this one."
4,Microsoft Word Home and Student 2007,"I was unhappy with the site selection process. After selecting the first item on the list, I determined that despite the lower cost, the delivery time I required was't there regardless of shipping method selected. I ended up paying a slightly higher cost to get the next day delivery I required."
4,A looong stretch from Word 97,"Replaced Word 97 with Word 2007 and it was quite a stretch. All I wanted was a word processing program for basic wp--what I really wanted was Word 97 all over again but couldn't find it. The new version is like going back to a familiar forest after 10 years and finding it overgrown and difficult to navigate. A lot of the stuff I used constantly in 97 has been buried with what for me is a lot of useless features--like replacing simple autotext with building blocks. And some other features aren't supported any more, such as opening multiple dox from the desktop. But I persevered, discoved how to use the Quick Access Toolbar to simplify the main toolbar to a usable minimum. I could wish for more backwards compatibility (a phrase that MS probably uses as a curse) with W97 dox, but this is okay, considering it was 10 years ago. Surprisingly usable once you get used to it. A recommendation--if you have PATIENCE!!"
4,Eh....,I like Macs but I had to get this particular software to run on Windows. It's cheaper than the business edition. It does okay.
5,Impact with accessibility,"I have an affection for comic books but haven't kept up with the various graphic novels. I heard a radio spot on this book and was intrigued. The story has a real emotional kick that I suspect will be relevant for many people. I read it for Father's Day and couldn't help but reflect on the message that this has about the decision to have children as well as the many other thoughts that are expressed about how we choose to live our lives. Variously introspective and contemplative about the world condition, the book grabs our interest with both ideas and art. Highly recommended."
2,Ok,"There were a few funny parts here but for the most part the movie was not that good. If looking for a lmao movie, this is not it!"
1,Skip the Sequel,"The original Games People Play was an excellent book. This one is verbose, poorly organized and the author seems more interested in being witty than conveying information. Has Berne's early success gone to his head? This book is not written with the same discipline and focus as his first book which is pithy and informative. If you want to explore the subject of Transactional Analysis further, this is NOT the book to do it with. His first book is ranked around 5200 on the Amazon sales chart... this one 360,000. There's a reason for that. Skip the Sequel."
5,John Bush Rules!!!!!!!!!,"Unlike this New York Wigger Clown who probably wears his Yankees hat sideways and says yo yo dawg. And was too much of a coward to leave his ID. The fact is without John Bush today it would be Anthrax who? With John in the band they rock harder and more melodic than they ever did. He should just stick to M&M and F-off. P.S. Armored Saint is 10,000 times the Heavy Metal Band that Anthrax will ever be!!! And if any more members of Armored Saint go over to help Anthrax out because there members keep dropping like flies then they should change the name to Anthrax Saint!!!"
1,Did I receive a CD that someone else returned?,"The music is beautiful, but I was really surprised with the poorness of presentation. The CD jewel case was badly damaged. The cover fell off as soon as I removed the plastic wrap, and the bottom corner of the case was completely missing. It's all an enigma -- the shrink wrap was intact and there were no small pieces of plastic anywhere. Perhaps this was a returned CD?But back to the music - it is relaxing. There are only a few songs on the CD, which explains the low price."
3,Run of the mill Hawaiian instrumentals,"This is a CD of stereotypically Hawaiian songs orchestrated with laid-back to slightly upbeat rhythms. Not the best of Hawaiian albums, but quite listenable. The supposed wave sounds are more of a surging and waning hiss, the kind of sound you'd get from one of those ""white noise"" machines. The songs aren't as long as the track listing says, though. They end early, leaving ten seconds or more of only the ""waves."" Still, the combination of relaxing songs and the ""ocean"" sounds makes it a good CD to try to sleep to if you have noisy neighbors.If you want more of a variety, including more upbeat songs, I would suggestWorld's a Stage: Music of Hawaii, by George Kulokahai & His Island Serenaders."
5,Righteous Kill Review,This was an excellent movie with 2 of the top actors in the industry (DeNiro and Pacino). A must see!
2,Jon Avnet is in a rut,"After teaming with Al Pacino in ""88 Minutes,"" one of the dumbest and most ridiculous movies of the decade, Avnet follows up with ""Righteous Kill,"" which is not nearly as bad, but leaves a lot to be desired. The movie leads you along a certain path, only to reveal at the end an unexpected turn. Yes, it's unexpected. It's also kind of ridiculous. One and a half stars."
3,"Could have been a lot better, but OK as is","I enjoyed this film, although you can figure out the ending about half-way through. I really enjoyed Pacino and DeNiro, but they're too old for these characters. Pacino gives a flambouant performance, which is fun, but that you only see when a director has no control over him! He literally steals the show with his mugging. In fact, he's about the only actor in the film that seems to be enjoying himself."
4,Decent,"No, this is not ""Heat Part 2"", but it's not bad. Deniro and Pacino are really good actors and work together well, once again. There's a decent amount of action and intrigue but not enough for five stars. Because it was kept to a respectable time, given the material, I'm tempted to give it five stars -- there are too many three star movies that would drag on another 20 to 30 minutes just to meet a two hour ""standard"". It's good for an evening viewing, especially with busy schedules."
3,Righteous kill,"I agree with the reviewer on here who said this would have been a decent cop flick if it were not for Deniro and Pacino which increases the audience's expectations. These two guys are probably the best actors of their generation, but something just doesn't click well for them. Maybe it's because they are better off playing arch enemies (HEAT) than friends. I thought Walberg did a really good job and so did Johnny L."
4,I thought it was pretty good,"The truth is DeNiro and Pacino have both made some very humdrum movies in recent years, but this isn't one of them. Yes, DeNiro has seemingly played this role 1,000 times before, but Pacino's character has a bit more originality. Both are jaded NYPD vets, but still with a few good days left in them. The bad guys, except for 50 Cent, are all pretty forgettable. And though Brian Dennehy plays the cop boss, he isn't given much to do. The movie is all about DeNiro and Pacino. The pacing is quick, and the dialogue is relatively smart. Enough twists to make this worthwhile."
1,Boring and Predictable,"I only saw this movie once several years ago, but I remember it clearly. With this caliber of actors involved in the project I expected a good movie and was excited to see it. About 45 minutes into this stinker, I looked at my wife and told her that it was obvious that the Pacino character was the killer. After sitting through another hour of redundancy, I was correct.When you are 1/3 of the way through the movie and can guess exactly how it will end, that is the sign of a terrible movie. For two actors that are this good to be in a movie this bad, they better have gotten paid well."
3,Rent it.,This is definitely entertaining. De Niro and Pacino are great. It's a clever story and there are surprises. But it just doesn't have the greatness that would bring you back to it and require you to watch it again and again. Rent it. Stream it. I don't think you need to buy it.
2,This movie is horrid.,"I rented this movie to watch Deniro and Pacino. Carla Gugino played an interesting, if limited, role as Deniro's twisted girlfriend. Her predilictions make the age difference work. John Leguizamo (sp) and Donnie Wahlberg are completely wasted talent in this poorly written piece of absolute crap."
4,we bang screw in TN,yo wut it dew? dis cd is off da chain i had 2 buy cuz song number 2 wuz da first chopped and screwed cd i ever heard n since then thats the only music i listen 2 now so if u like chopp n screw music u should pick this cd up
5,Tha Best Yet,This CD right here is blazin Its better than the last Lone Star Ridaz CD. Its got some better beats and better rymes. I suggest that all yall pick this up
1,Flip it? You mean stick it....,"I received this flip it for christmas after I asked my parents for a hoover brand. At first, I thought it was great but then it gets clogged up very easily and the stuff it doesnt pick up gets blown all over. I have a toddler that drops food and a dog that sheds so I thought I would love this for my WHITE (shows every little mark) kitchen floor & My hardwood floors in the rest of the house. I wouldnt recommend this item. Theres tooo many flaws.Just imagine trying to clean out the clogged mess...not a pretty or well smelling sight :( Sorry Bissell, Try Again."
1,What a waste!,I can't believe how excited I was to purchase this vacuum only to be disappointed. The vacuum had no suction...my daughters Barbie vacuum works better. The wet portion of this machine is not any better...definitely not dry ready to walk on. The only good thing about this machine is that I it was easy to take apart and return to the store!!!
1,This thing doesn't suck,which is a big problem if it's a vacuum cleaner. The first time I used it was to clean up after a haircut. It would have been easier to use a broom and dustpan.Steer clear of this one.
2,Very Very Dissapointed!!!!,"My hubbie is in the army and we just moved to on base houseing, and we have wood floors.. We got a puppy and my wet jet just wasn't doing the job.. So i was going to get a floor mate.. While at the store i saw the fip it for cheaper and was like oh i like that!!!!! Well i got it home and used it. I wouldn't have minded that sqeegie didn't work that well, but was REALLY upset when the vaccume blows debris around and when it does suck it sounds like something is getting stuck! So it is going back in the box and back to the store tonight and i am getting the floor mate.. IF THEY HAVE ANY LEFT!!!!!!!!"
1,Bissell Flip-It is a Waste of Money,"I purchased the Bissell Flip-It about 6 months ago after a friend recommended it. At first, I had the same problem other users have reported, the vacuum blowing dust, dirt, and hair away from suction head. I reported the problem to Bissell and they sent a gasket that prevented the exhaust air from blowing forward (I still believe this is a serious design flaw). Even after making this change my wife and I find the Flip-It to be a poor vacuum; our $19.95 Eureka ""The Boss"" bagless does a much better job. The wet cleaning is marginally better but we think it takes less effort to use towels and floor cleaner to clean our Pergo flooring. We gave the Filp-It to the thrift store two weeks ago and don't miss it a bit."
2,Still seeing streaks,"I have had this unit for a bit over a year, and I try not to use it too often. I have tried both the brush and the pads, but still get streaks. If I want to rid of the streaks I have to go over an area with a towel to help prevent them. I have laminate floors, have used it with and without the laminate floor cleaner. If anyone has a trick to this, let me know."
1,Bisssell Flip it Mop,"This mop flips OK but the suction part for drying up the wet floors is useless. As soon as you hit a bump or tilt the stick backwards too far or sometimes for no reason at all, the suction stops and you are left with a soaking wet and dangerously slippery floor. You have to switch the unit off and start the motor again for the dryer suction to engage but by then you have already left wet floor sections everywhere which you can't see unless you are in direct sunlight."
4,Bissell floor cleaner,"I really like this floor cleaner as I have six dogs living in y house , who go in and out of doors all the time. I have found that the sponge does get a little wet, so what I do after I have completed a floor ( especially on my Laminate flooring) , I just remove it add go over the floor with the Flip - it sans the sponge to vacuum up any leftover water.My floors have never been this clean, with so little effort. it is light weight, easy to clean."
1,don't waste your money,"What an absolute piece of rubbish. I only paid $40 and I feel like I got ripped off - I've used it twice, now the vacuum part doesn't suck (literally...figuratively it just plain sucks)."
4,L.A. Woman is worth buying,"It's got three real good songs on it: Love her madly, L.A. woman and Riders on the storm. Most of the songs are good on this album and this is worth buying even if you aren't a Doors fan. Good music that you can relax and listen to."
2,Remixed and repolished,I have owned this album for about 6 years and I know it pretty well. I recently purchased the 2007 version and have to say that even though it sounds very clean (no tape his) it seems they have also smoothed over the feel of the music. I don't mind that the song versions are slightly different. I prefer the 2000 version. It feels more alive even though it has less detail.
5,180 Gram LA Woman=High Definition Doors,"Ordered this Lp from Amazon supplier Go Hastings, and despite being beat to crap on the way, the LP itself arrived undamaged. The quality of the 180 gram pressing was supurb. The defintion and clarity was 1st class. On ""Cars Hiss by my Window"" the vinyl is so quiet I thought I was playing a CD. Morrison's voice was made for analog."
5,"The Doors LA Woman, 1970","This Doors album is different from really all the other ones for one its more of a blues rock album than all the other psychedelic albums out there(morrison hotel exception) anyways its a good album. Some of the key tracks on here are, love her madly, LA woman, riders on the storm, been down so long, the changeling, etc.all in all its a good album and i would recomend it for any doors fan around"
4,This is more like it.,"After some lemons The Doors give us a peach. This is probably the album they would've wanted ""Strange Days"" to be. This is alot more polished than thier first album, but still has a dark haunting sound. ""Riders On The Storm"" has become one of my favorites as it's got a thunderstorm in the mix( I can listen to them all day, ""LAmerica"" has a Sabbath riff written all over it one of Morrison's better trances he's been under, The rest of the songs are hit and miss, but after 4 studio albums that didn't follow up from thier debut this is a far cry better. With the maturity on this album it makes me wonder what would've happened had Morrison not have died."
4,The rating is for the original mixdown,"This is not 1971 mixdown, which presumably was approved by ALL four members of the band and reflected their original intent.Remixing, while making it more satisfactory to the ear accustomed to current trends, compromises it's value of what people liked and bought for the last 39 years. It would been a better thing to remaster the original recording and, if space permitted, add as many remixes that showed the alternate benefits of what it might sound like recorded today or reveal hidden aspects that may have been deliberately buried in the mix as part of the 1971 mix for the benefit of the curious."
3,stay with the old CD or album,"There is definitely a change in the way the album sounds. I am listening to Riders On The Storm right now, and the ending is very different. I think if the album were cleaned up or something along those lines for hiss or tape defects (wow and flutter), then I would recommend it highly for that reason. However the remixing of the tracks may take some time to get use to.The two bonus songs are interesting. In fact, the second one ""You Nead Meat"" is pretty good!If you still have the old CD or LP, don't through it away. I still hate it when band memebers have to go back to the studios decades later nad try to rework the magic that was already there. For me, the old magic on this current reworked cd is tainted!"
5,Adios Jimmy. Sorry to see you go.,"L.A. Woman, the last of the Doors studio albums is perhaps their best. The songs are rad, yeah. Whatever, it gets me off. However, fans should know this: if you go into the bathroom and chant 'Mr. Mojo Risin' five times Jimmy will appear and stab all of your enemies. Now, go buy this album and exact your revenge."
5,Fantastic,What can I say about this great box-set Rick was truly one of the greatest rockers ever.Disc one shows what a great early rocker he was. Disc 2 shows what a great pop crooner he could be. Disc 3 shows him once again revealing another side as a country-folk-rock singer. man this guy was versatile. Just a fantastic collection.
4,This is a good starter book.,"It is a good book, and it explains how the arcane society bagan. It is a little of a hard read. If you read this book first you will not continue, but I read 2 others and got hooked, so I needed to know how it starts. If this is the first Amanda Quick book you have read, put this down and read others and then come back to this."
3,FROM CARTOON TO 3D!,"They did a good job bringing Liberty City from cartoon to 3D but they should've left it as Brocklyn, Kings, Brix, and Manhaddan bordering the Garden State of New Guernsey instead of changing it to Portland Island and Staunton Island bordering Shoreside Vales! The protagonist is none other than silent Claude Speede who's shot by his girlfriend Catalina Villasenor during a bank robbery, left for dead, arrested, sentenced to 10 years, and busted out of a police convey headed for Liberty State Pennitentury! He doesn't talk! He'll take any job to make ends meet! He's known to kill his bosses after they hve no more work for him! I hope he gets killed in a later game!"
2,I agree with the majority. Tom Clancey it ain't!,"Well I have read all of Clancey's and they go from great to ""Politika"" or ""Why did I do this?"" I agree with other comments about either he didn't write this or maybe he did the outline. Good luck next time Tom, I won't be buying your books without hearing about them first, I want to know that it will be good."
3,Is this Clancy?,"The storyline of the book is good but very underdeveloped, as well as seemingly rushed at the end. This book may have easily gone on longer (I breezed through it). The book is actually an advertisement for Politika--The Video Game. I felt very used after I bought. Looks to me like Clancy wrote a sentence and helped this book's (and the video game's) sales soar."
3,This one ain't THAT bad!,"Apparantly this book is not liked by every Clancy-admirer. I liked it though. It was definately not written by Clancy himself: he needs more words to tell a story and the sex and violence are more explicit than in his own books. It is a fast read, the plot is exciting and not every hero is invincible (things that can't be said of Clancy's latest work ""Rainbow Six""). One point of criticism: if Clancy gets so much help from other people to write a book (see the Preface), he should be able to find a person who can speak and write the Russian language properly."
4,Interesting,"This book was a good book to read in an afternoon, but it needed some more length. It was great but it was to short. It had awesome details and action. It is very interesting about what might happen if the president of Russia did die. I recommend this book to anyone who has an afternoon to not do anything."
1,This was a waste of paper. Politika.,"I anxiously read this book, hoping to tide myself over on great Tom Clancy material until the next great book of his is released and lo, this was what I read. It was horrible! I could have read any other book by Clancy. Gee another disaster hits America? Sum of All Fears? Clancy probably just cut and pasted this story out of his hard drive. The characters are one dimensional, the plot is laughable, and most importantly, I was unsatisfied with the reasons enumerated by the author as to why a corporation would need a militia. I read through it laughing at a California business getting its paid goons killed in Russia. Why? I asked that about the plot and ask that about my purchase."
1,don't waste your money on this one !,"I have much enjoyed - pondered and reread - the 'real' Tom Clancy series: since the beginning of the Op-Center genre, have been very disappointed. They are short; low on concept and content; and lack any interest in the way of ideas. Mr Clancy's name is on the cover: but the content/concept of this latest one is persistently and disappointingly low grade and is of the ""breathless hero/it will all turn out OK in the end"". Please, come back the 'real' Tom Clancy - you have talent - and please plase do not put your name to this disappointing pap ! Let Mr Greenburg have the ??kudos. Reader - don't waste your money on this one"
3,It's not THAT bad...,"While I admit, this book is considerably worse than other Clancy books I have read, but I think some reviews were a little harsh. Well, what do you expect from a book based on a Stargey Game...?"
1,Zzz... Zzz...,"I had high hopes when I bought this novel. The concept immediately enthralled me; the idea that the death of Boris Yeltsin creates a power vacuum, which resurrects the old Cold War hostilities between the west and the east. It is such a compelling concept that I couldn't help but buying it.The first few chapters did not disappoint, as the plot moved quickly and set up much suspense. After the beginning, however, this disintegrated and the novel degraded into a sleep stimulator. By half way through this garbage it became a tedious snooze fest only useful for inducing a catatonic like sleep or as an ineffectual paperweight!This novel was such a disappointment, mainly because it had so much potential. Shame on you Tom Clancy for getting my hopes up and then crushing them!"
2,Promising start but withers quickly,"This was a major misfire from TC. Is this the alter ego of Clancy? It reminds me of Spielberg:the good Spielberg who makes Schindler's List, ET, and Saving Private Ryan; and the bad Spielberg who makes The Temple of Doom and The Lost World. This book takes a long time to move along-unless 100 pages is acceptable to you-and only sparked my interest due to the New Years bombing. This isn't as bad as the newer Rainbow Six( which bites a lot). I just miss the old Clancy:the one who gave us Red October, Patriot Games, Red Storm Rising, Clear and Present Danger, etc. Come on Tom; no more power plays to make a quick buck are gonna work here."
2,Better read ICON,"This book is not exactly very bad, but it is quite weak. A shallow story, weak characters and not well written. I had the impression that the author, opposite to the REAL Clancy, didn't alwyays know what he's talking about. Dear guys at RED STORM: I'm getting tired of books with Tom Clancy on the cover but not inside. I think that even Mr. Clancy didn't like the book too much. Look at the editorial. In his ""Op-Center"" series he always thanked his ghost-writer for the ""invaluable contribution"" to the book. This time, in POLITIKA, he only thanked the ghost-writer for the ""valuable contribution."" Quite a down-turn, isn't it? Mr. Clancy, WRITE another book on your own and stop launching boring spin-off series!END"
2,"Not bad, but...","This book was not too bad, although, none of the Power Plays, Op-Centers, or Net Force series have really appealled to me. I think Clancy should stick with the original series centered around Jack Ryan, first, and then John Clark (Rainbow Six). I think Tom Clancy should continue with the original series but now have Ding Chavez as the main character. He is young enough that several books could be written about him without age becoming a factor."
2,I need more,"I like this better than the All Cardio Step DVD But not as much as The ""15 Minute Work out for dummies"" That Gay Gasper does. I wish there was a better routine to the exercises."
2,Disappointed,The video is strictly for beginners--which I should have known. It is slow slow slow. Makes the work out go on for what seems like forever. I am returning to 8 minute abs and arms legs and buns. It too is for beginners but does not waste the video time the Dummies tape does.
1,worst exercise video,"Because of the title, I expected this to be a low impact, easy to do aerobic workout so I was dissappointed to find out it is not. Also,it goes from step-by-step instructions on how to do the steps, which is extremely slow so you can't get your heart rate up. Then it switches to full speed ahead when you are actually doing the excercises like they are supposed to be done, so for me it was like there was no warm up. I'm not in excellant condition, but neither am I a beginner, but I was huffing and puffing after just a few minutes and barely made it to 10 minutes before I had to stop because it was not comfortable for me. So, I think that it should be explained in the product description that the workout is high intensity. Maybe they should title the next one ""for Dumber Dummies?"""
5,cute durable book,"My granddaughter loves Dora I bought this book for the shape - I did not expect it to be some cute and fun for her. She loves the glitter pictures and flaps in the book.She was 18 mos when I got it for her and still brings it to me at almost 2 to read it to her, and as she plays with the flaps she can do them easily herself. I bought this book for her to have fun with and it has exceeded my expectations."
1,Not Good!,"I too waited for this book to come out and I was disappointed! This story was not well developed at all. I mean how and when did she fall in love with Tony???? I could see some sort of development of love with Joe. Her family was crazy, then throw in the mix of her friends and I was confused. It seems like there should be a part two to this book. Lizette here are some hints for a possible part two, develop the love story between The two main characters. Since Dawn is moving to Miami, develop a relationship between her and Joe. Let us see how Tony's family and friends handle his relationship with an African-American woman. These are just some suggestions."
2,Pretty bad...Two stars b/c I finished it in one day,"Well, this was a disappointment. I am an avid fan of MOST IR stories and this one did not make the cut. First off, I wholly agree that the two main characters were kept apart for too much of the story. Just unreal. And when the ILYs came, I asked myself ""why?"" Too much time was spent with the other guy, Joe."
4,very enjoyable read,"This is a first book by a new author. I read the reviews and was shocked that people could be so cruel. I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading more from Lizzette G. Carter. Everyone has to have a starting point, this is hers and it was enjoyable. Keep writing Lizzette, I look forward to reading your next novel. And, I'm hoping for a sequel to show where this couple ends up now that they are together."
4,"Good, but with reservations","A good graphic form for Lovecraft, except for the miserable story of Lovecraft's life. I wish they had chosen some of the more powerful Lovecraft, like Dunwich Horror or Call of Cthulhu, instead of the stories they did choose. All in all, a decent comic, but not as good as it could be."
5,Great Movie,"I started watching this with my Grandma when I was little and have wanted to buy it ever since. Great, fun, and entertaining. I love this movie."
4,Thoroughly AWESOME,"This is a great movie. Having Mary Tyler Moore, Julie Andrews, and Carol Channing ought to tell you how good it is. I love the cooky music and dances. This is either something you love or hate though. I tried to get my friend to watch it and she hated it. It is so silly and stupid that I found it hilarious. My friend just thought it was stupid and annoying."
4,Hollywood's Roaring Twenties,"This is a film for fans of Julie Andrews, Carol Channing and Mary Tyler Moore; big splashy musical numbers; the Hollywood romantic view of the twenties. The costumes are ""really spiffy"". Not much storyline, but if you let yourself go, this is a lot of fun. Warning: This is NOT a racially sensitive film. The reflection of the Asian community will make you cringe."
5,Raise your skirts and bob your hair,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, besides ""Luv"" with Jack Lemmon.Just the small lines you don't catch the first time become more visible the second, or third, or fourth, or..., the 98th time you've watched it. My roommate and his boyfriend and I would watch it 2 or 3 times a week. ""Raspberries!"" exclaims Muzzy, while flying with Baron von Richter up to meet Miss Dorothy, Millie, and Jimmy.When Jimmy did the Tapioca, I couldn't stop singing it for days. It stuck in my head. When Judith yells, ""Soy sauce!"" that sticks in your head, especially if you eat alot of Hawaiin or Chinese foods.Jimmy in drag is hilarious. We had to pause the movie until we stopped laughing.You will love it."
4,Ummm..... can I tell you how much I love this movie?!,"""Welcome everybody! Welcome!"" Yeah...welcome to one of the best movies this side of Saudia Arabia! Thoroughly Modern Millie is so much fun to watch over and over! Its hysterical and a fun musical. The cast is great- Julie is great as Millie, and Mary Tyler Moore is incredibly hysterical as Miss Dorothy, Carol Channing is simply the best as Muzz (Razzzzzberries!), and Beatrice Lillie is so off-the-wall as Mrs. Meers, the house-mother with a love for the Pacific Rim. This spoof made me laugh so hard and my friend Bonnie (who introduced me to this movie) and I quote the wonderful lines all the time! (""Don't worry Miss Dorothy, the kids will soon forget your dress is real lace and ask you to dance."") Everything from the dance sequence in the elevator to the ""tap-tap tap-tap-ioca"" to ""SOYYYY SAUCE!!!!"", to Baron Von Richter and his loop-de-loops (they do wonders for the inner ear, ya know!), the movie is non-stop fun. Go get it ahora mismo!"
4,Quite enjoyable!,"Not really a big fan of Blur's (w/ or w/o Graham Coxon) or of Damon Albarn's, but I don't mean to say that this is a terrible cd. In fact each of the songs is good, never mind if it's a bit esoteric sometimes (sample: ""It's got nothing to do with vorsprung durch technic you know""). Plus most of the music is pretty upbeat, and the styles are surprisingly diverse that make for a really fun listening. This is a great way to introduce yourself to Blur. You'll never get bored with it.Suggestion: for perfect driving companions (especially if you're set for a long drive) get this cd, along with ""A Secret History"", (also a best-of cd) by the Divine Comedy (this is the third time I'm actually ""plugging"" this!)"
2,the father of spin:edward l bernays & the birth of PR,"The book is entertaining in parts and provides interesting information to someone who has no prior knowledge on Bernays. But considering the impact Bernay's ideas & work made on PR and spin and consequently the American way of life, I found the writing style to be rather flippant; and the book, as a whole, skimpy. From the research material available and the interviews which he had conducted, Tye could have written a more substantial if not a scholarly piece, irrespective of his sentiments for Bernays the person. Perhaps, that was not his intention. However, Tye did make a bold claim with his title, and I naturally expected more from his book."
2,another dirty magazine,its just another dirty magazine The only redeaming part of it was it really hurts no one and it gave my son a stiffy
4,Banabila - VoizNoiz,"A bizarre little album that came completely out of leftfield and stayed there. Voiz Noiz is cut-up, abstract trip-hop -- if such a thing is possible. The majority of the album is composed of seemingly random vocal snippets, complemented by beats and music. The effect is jarring, but also strangely compelling. A few of the songs seem oddly freeform, without much structure; since the run times on the tracks are so short, however, the scattered nature of the songs don't outstay their welcome. ""Mono/Metro"" is probably the most traditional of the tracks, while ""Where?"" is a striking and fascinating mixture of vocals (such as they are), silence, and piano. Definitely for those who crave something different."
3,The Tornadoes without George White are not the Tornadoes,"The Tornadoes releases post George White, their original sax player are just not the same band. Having seen and heard them many times in the early sixties and again in the nineties I can assure you, that Mr.White was the fire, the spirit and the spark plug that got the rest of the band fired up. Without him they just seem to be vapid and mere shells of the original band.George, wherever you are, we miss you. You were always the driving force behind the band in any live performance."
2,Where's George White,"This CD is allright but without the soulfull Sax playing of the origional sax player, George White, this band no longer has it. The groove, charisma and overall spirit is missing without Mr. White, who can be heard on the origional Bustin Surfboards release in the early 60's. Where's George! It's just not the Tornadoes withou him!"
5,Great Compilation!,"The Eagles are amazing, and this has to be one of the best compilations ever made! Most of the great pre-Hotel California album songs are on here, including my favorite song by them, ""Witchy Woman"". A must have!"
3,"This is okay, but it's missing a lot...","This 1971-75 compilation is just average. Like its continuation (Vol. 2), this has some of the Eagles' best songs from this time period, but has too many missing. ""James Dean"", ""Ol' 55"", and ""Midnight Flyer"" are nowhere to be found here, and ""After The Thrill Is Gone"" is stuck on the second compilation. Grab ""Eagles: The Very Best of"" instead of this and its sequel. It has all the songs featured here, and many more."
5,One of the staples of classic rock,"It is not difficult to see why this is the greatest selling album of all time. The Eagles, with their catchy beats and great lyrics, have a far reach. They apply to many, many people: fans of country, rock, and pop alike (to name a few). What really makes this a great album, however, is not its universal appeal, but the sheer power of its tracks.This album, of course, highlights the greatest hits of the Eagles' first albums. And what a great ride it is. From the opening moments of 'Take it Easy' to final seconds of 'Best of My Love,' the Eagles deliver. The only reason any fan of classic rock or pop should not own this album is if he or she owns all of the Eagles' studio albums from this period. Otherwise, the Eagles' greatest hits is a must have for any collection."
1,Hotel Catatonia,"The fact that this album is the biggest selling catalog item to date really says a lot about how much the United States cherishes mediocrity in music. And no American artist is more cherished than the Eagles.Taking their cue from far superior bands (The Flying Burrito Brothers, the Byrds, The Band, etc.), the Eagles were certainly country-rock's first and most successful mercenaries, sucking all life from the genre, and, at the same time, making Gram Parsons turn over in his grave (though not technically, thanks to Phil ""The Human Torch"" Kaufman).If you want a truly great album, try ""The Guilded Palace of Sin"" by the Flying Burrito Brothers. Believe me, it's so much better than this tripe. The Eagles have far more money than they know what to do with already. Their thoughtless, condescending, mindless songs make up a shameful catalog that should be burned in effigy (as well as physically)."
1,boo,"The Eagles are the most boring cliched band. There is much much better American music out there, such as The Beach Boys and Creedence Clearwater Revival. I couldn't believe that this was ranked the best selling album of all time. It's sickening."
4,Easy to listen to and showa the eagles at their best,"Before the 1976 release of ""Hotel California,"" one of the groups most beloved songs and albums, the Eagles released a buch of pretty mediocre albumw, having only one or two really nice songs. This compilation takes all the neccessary songs--all hits!--and puts it on one disc. While other artists on their greatest hits albums will put fan favorites and such, this album is only putting on the hits, so your bound to recognize everything even if you don't listen to the Eagles. This album will let any new fan see why the eagles dominated the charts and it goes by rather quickly and easliy so you won't get board. Fans may not like this as much because it doesn't contain Hotel california, New Kid in Town, Life in the Fast lane, pretty maids all in a row and heartache tonight--all release on a second volume of the series--but this album is still good. i'd recommend buying both the albums together as Amazon offers."
3,5 stars for the music - 1 star for the packaging,Its hard to believe that this superb music comes in a cardboard sleeve.Its a shame for The Eagles.
4,Reggae for a Pop Mentality,"An excellent disk for those who like variety in their CD folder. This one has not left mine since buying the disk over eight months ago. Many tunes are recognizable hits pop radio will touch on from time to time (""Red Red Wine"", ""Can't Help Falling in Love"") and many pleasant surprises for those who have not exactly kept up with the band over the years. The cover of the Doors ""Light My Fire"" is a standout with its catchy shuffle beat, and the enchanting ""Kingston Town"" is a delight for the reggae fan. A warning though: the version of ""Can't Help..."" on this disk is not the usual pop radio version, but still enjoyable in itself. A refreshing retrospect of a band who have stayed with the style that made them popular, and truly seem to enjoy making music together!"
4,Twisted...,This ones a pretty good one. The girl has a wreck and ends up in a hospital and has her face restructured from what was left and was made to look like her friend which vanished from the wreck and later comes to find her newly look a like friend overall its prettyt good.
5,A+,"LOVED it, totally fantastic and definitely a good buy, make a good purchase with this one and you'll be pleased"
4,Great work out,"Even though this book is for ""dummies"" I still found some of the work out to be difficult for me to understand, so instead of just sitting there I would do crunches to pass the time or the exercise before that, other then that I love this video and in due time I will get it all down very well."
4,Painful on the neck,A good introduction to Pilates. However the beginning position for some exercises with head raised and shoulder blades on the mat is painful for the neck if you are prone to neck pain. Pilates as shown here cannot be considered fun although I believe it is an effective body conditioner.
4,Great Workout!!,"I enjoy using this video. The first few times, I wasn't able to complete the whole tape, but after a few tries, I am usually able to complete it. My only complaint, really, is that the ""to make this easier"" tips come after about 8 reps of any particular exercise. I know them all now, but when I was starting out, I would have liked to know a little sooner that I could make it easier on myself."
2,Don't love it or hate it,"I've recently started back with Pilates after a 4 year break. Since this had a beginner and intermediate workout, I thought it would be a good reintroduction for me. It's very mediocre. Like most tapes out there, there's too much time taken by the instructor teaching and demonstrating before every exercise in the routine. This is ok if you're a real beginner, but after the first 5-6 times through, or if you have some experience and familiarity, it gets very old. Once you forward through, you've lost the flow (picking up and putting down the remote a zillion times) and only get about 20 minutes of workout.The routines themselves are pretty good for newbies or out of shape people. The intermediate workout could really use more challenging exercises and less instruction between each one. If you're a true beginner and you use this tape at least 3x week, you'll be ready to buy something else in about a month tops. I wanted to give it a true middle rating of 2.5."
4,Great for First-Timers,"I highly recommend this DVD if you have never done Pilates. Winsor Pilates Basics really isn't a workout, just a step by step instruction on how to do the exercises. This DVD is an actual workout.Another thing I like about this DVD is the instructor, Michelle Dozois. She is very easy to understand & she has a fantastic body. She's not ""Hollywood"" skinny. She looks like a real person & that motivates me."
3,It is not for the dummies,Pilates beginners only can do less than 10% of this workout. Why does the producer use the name of workout for dummies?
2,CRAPTASTIC!!!,"I used the entire book for MCAT preparation. I took the MCAT. The questions in this book were NOTHING like the MCAT. Don't waste your money on this book. More importantly, don't waste your time on this book."
5,AWESOME!,This is some of Rick's best work so far!! I have been a loyal fan of his music since I was a teenager but this CD is not that bubble gum music that he did in the 80's - the music on this CD is refreshing and shows off his pure musical talents!A must have for Rick Springfield Fans or for those who want new music.I give it 2 thumbs up!!!!!
5,This CD has an edge.,"The CD has a much edgier feel than past Springfield CD's. The lyrics are beautiful, yet brutal based on the song. The entire CD is filled with heavy emotion that makes you reflect on your own experiences with relationships and life. I highly suggest buying it."
2,Poor performance,"Being a Bryan Duncan fan, I eagerly picked up this CD. I found it disappointing. While you do sense the energy and fun that was there at the gig, the songs we love are full of mistakes, have poor backing vocals and are certainly not to the standard of his incredibly polished studio recordings. I was surprised that one song particularly was left on this album as the band stuffed it up, the b.v.'s miss their cue, Bryan even says ""This is a terrible song"". Still, it shows his sense of fun and the ability to laugh at himself. Best to buy his studio albums. They are awesome."
4,The Conformist,"I love Moravia. He's such a strange writer, yet when I'm reading his works I feel like the strange worlds they describe are totally normal. Marcello Clerici is a fine example--a really weird guy who I nevertheless identified with constantly. Wonderful novel."
2,Movie is better than book,"This is one of the few instances that I have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself. This is a contrived work through and through, and one can understand why Bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie. Moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm-chair psychology that is truly laughable....and this is probably his best novel."
5,Best camera for a mom,"I have had this camera for a month and I love it. It takes beautiful pictures in any condition and it is so fast. I have had a Nikon before but I missed every perfect moment because it took so long to take the picture. P150 is soooo fast. I have been taking pictures of my boys as they are running around and it has been wonderful. I also love the movie mode. I did months of research before I bought this camera and I could not be happier. It is compact enough to fit in my purse, easy to use, and takes beautiful pictures. What more could you want? Sony did a great job."
2,Outdoor Only,"With good light this camera is very nice but for indoor flash it is completely useless, instead of needing two cameras why not find one that can do both."
4,good,It was good. it could have went more in depth on why and how they were able to get in the game the way they did. But overall it was good.
5,A Classic Rock Masterpeice!!!,"Highway Star is the one song that made me want to play guitar. And now after hearing this recording -some 30 yrs ago!!!! I am still rockin' to Deep Purple!!! Child in Time is unrivaled to this day in the Scream department!!! SOTW - what can you say??? A true guitar riff classic of all time!!!! The perfect lead!!! Lazy is the perfect blues rock tune - great harmonica and vocal. And Space Truckin' is a real rocker!!! And now, you have the much in-demand gem of Lucille included!!! This is a MUST for any fan of classic rock or guitar player!!!!! Long live Deep Purple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Deep Purple's Made in Japan is best LIVE album ever.,"They apparently broke the record on loudest electric guitar in a live concert. This live version of ""Smoke on the Water"" with the slightly different Ian Gillan announcement and Richie Blackmore guitar intro blows all others out the water ('scuse the pun)! The instrumental play, recording and production make it a milestone. Buy it if only to get the live version of Smoke on the Water and play it loud on a good stereo with the best speakers! Deep Purple's Made in Japan is best LIVE album ever."
3,Deep Purple,It was hard for me to rate this cd recording. I really don't like it. It is live performances I guess from Japan. I don't consider it the best of Deep Purple. That is my fault for not listening to the tracks before I bought it. So I am not sure how to rate it. Will be buying a different best of Deep Purple cd though.
3,OK for the $,"As the other reviewer described, THERE IS NO BEADBOARD! The side panels are just smooth particle board and do not look like the picture shown. Also, the handles were plastic, not metal (at least on the black chest). That being said, it was otherwise what I wanted for this price: VERY easy to assemble, easy to clean, and looks pretty decent when done."
1,Not worth to buy!,"I have purchased over 100 dolars on science projects from smithsonian institute to teach my six grader, these were a waste of money, they are all nothing but toddler toys, upon receiving them we though we would give it a try anyway, now I regret not returning all of them right away. We barely used them sincce my son is a six grader and these are for kinder garden science projects."
2,Could be a lot better,"I am a big fan of both Can and Holgar Czukay, but I found this record very hard to get into.Can almost invented-or at least brought into rock-those repetative patterns and loops that make up what is now called dance music. But what kept Can ever interesting is all the little sounds that they added to these structues.Here, there is a lot of the repatition and not a lot on top of it to make it compelling. It is not bad by any strech, but nothing excitingIf you like this type of music, your better off with Can, Steve Riech or Terry Riley.Decent, but not essential ."
4,The lift that wont let you down,I purchased the playtex cross your heart bra for my wifeThis is a bra she has been happy using for many years because of comfort support and fitShe would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a natural liftThe service from Amazon was excellent
4,Inexpensive but comfortable,I like the fit but thought the fabric was not top quality. Perhaps it was what is to be expected for that price!!
1,"definitely ""full figure"" sizing.","Nice to find an inexpensive bra in size 32c that has straps centered on the cup: good for support and for keeping the bra from digging into my armpit with a 'bustline' that sits higher than average. However, this bra runs way too deep in the cup for the average figure. Should be labled as 'full figure' sizing."
1,5772,"product was not as avertised by manufactor, dose not work on 4 brl manifolds as stated, do not buy spectre products."
3,2 woman named Mako,"The second of the two tales on this disc is the one that is the most interesting. ""two women named Mako"" reminds me of Shakespere's quote ""all the world is a stage and the people its players."". I don't want to ruin the movie for you if you haven't seen it, but by the end, you'll understand why the saying ""in a true BDSM relationship the sub has all the power"" exists. If you don't understand why certain people in your life allow others to treat them like they do, this might help you understand."
1,Tokyo Decameron: Three Tails of Madness & Sensuality,"This movie had an excellant chance to display it's female cast in all their Asian wonders. Some of the more interesting moments in this movie are down played by a lack of a correct camera angle or plot development. The ""Rose Holder"" is one that could have been something more than it was. Yet you see nothing that would make you believe that it was erotic. I love Asian movies but this one is not one to be added to anyone's collection."
4,Oil your shredder regularly!,"It amazes me how every shredder on Amazon has some negative review that states it's the worst thing since Hitler. Every shredder regardless of price needs to be oiled in order to prevent the paper particles from drying out the gears. Buy paper shredder lube or if that's too messy get the 8x12 oiled paper sheets that they sell at Staples or any office supply store.And try not to be Ollie North and shred 500 pages in one sitting. When the shredder breaks down that's not a manufacturing defect, that's basic science."
2,Not happy,I bought this shredder and another model at the same time. This one is just not measuring up. It jams all the time and just doesn't work as well as I think it should!
3,MS Streets & Trips - Trust But Always Verify,"I bought this for my nationwide travels with an RV. It's great to plan with; has a very fine database for finding places, like RV parks/campgrounds, stores, train stations, etc. The maps are very nice to print out along with directions. BUT, and this is a big BUT, I found I have to always verify the route and destination with my GPS unit and Google maps. If I go only by MS S&T, I can end up in the wrong place, which can be difficult with 60 feet of RV. I trusted it for a destination in NJ and it put me across a marina, down a cobblestone street, in a parking lot for the Statue of Liberty. Fortunately there was enough room to turn around and, after a call to the real destination, I found my way there. That's happened several times. Overall, it's nice, but not accurate."
4,GPS and Streets and Maps,This product is all I expect it to be. Minor issues have been:o Sometimes it takes a little longer to get the GPS to start tracking. When you plug in the GPS it should start tracking automatically instead of making the user click the clicking the gps navigation button.o I wish the talking would include streets for eyes off use. I heard the competition has this feature.o I think this is a great teaching tool for my children who now pay attention to where they are and how to get to places instead of daydreaming.
4,Streets & Trips by Microsoft,This is the poor man's GPS system....very comprehensive and updateable (traffic & roadwork conditions). A must-have for we who are directionally challenged!!
4,Pretty good,This system is very good for road trips. I just went on a road trip for spring break and it worked. I had a similar system from back in 1999 from Co-Pilot. The Co-pilot system was not a accurate but had some features that should have been in Streets and Trips. For instance Co-pilot had a voice recognition and could verbalize the turn by turn directions. It could also answer select question such a 'how far' 'next turn'...Over all I am giving Streets and Trips 4 stars because is does have a great receiver and an incredible number of points of interest. I would buy it again but just expected more from a product 8 years newer than my last system. I mean think about how far laptops have come.
3,OK For Trip Panning and S.A. On The Road - Not for Geocaching,See title - for geocaching you NEED DeLorme since it'll almost always show you which side of the creek the cache is really on!
4,works pretty well,"All I can say is, the product works pretty well for my recent trip to Rochester, NY, Buffalo and Niagara Falls. The receiver worked flawlessly, the direction I was given is fairly simple and clear. Of course nothing is perfect as in this case the MST could not accurately determine whether the street doesn't allow left turns or not. Overall for the price and what you get in the package, it's a deal and you'll like it. It is great for highway and expressway traveling, the voice helped too."
3,"Tricky, but seems to work","I found this product very difficult to install and came close to sending it back twice. The software and user guide show all the signs of having been tested by the people who did the development. Once you have worked with it for a few days, it begins to make sense, but in the beginning it is very obscure. I still do not entirely trust it and am very concerned that I could find myself locked out of the data I put on the drive. Which is a bit of a limitation for something that I need to trust as my backup storage. I will keep my previous solution going a little in parallel.That said, it does appear to do what it says on the tin. I have had to reboot it a number of times following extremely large transfers (200 GB)but the data is there."
5,Five Star Soul;( Four for length),"Despite the dismal length of the vinyl original (I also owned that,) this is part of the Little Milton (Campbell) legacy. His version of of ""Behind Closed Doors"" puts the pedal to the wonderful Charlie Rich original. Equally fine is the stinging version of ""You're No Good"" which found its way into easily a half-dozen mix cassettes of mine. ""Hard Luck Blues"" features his hard BB King styled, but not as liquid guitar, and his grainy voice. ""Sweet Woman of Man"" is also a stand-out cut with more guitar. Since I first heard this some nearly thirty years ago, I am not an objective observer. But ""Grits Ain't Groceries"" and Milton was most certainly the real deal. (He also renders a fine version of the Billie Holiday tune ""Tain't Nobody's Business... "" on this disc. ) I can't imagine not liking this album."
1,horrible,I found this book to be riddled with innaccuracies of a theogical nature. Should we really teach our children that God does not help them?
4,Good read,"Enjoyable continuation to the Hideaway series. Despite being in love since adolescence it was not smooth sailing for Chris and Emily. I enjoyed the humorous moments with their Dads almost coming to blows about their relationship- with Joshua being a little too overprotective- you would think a 30 year old woman could make her own decisions about who she sleeps with without Daddy being upset about it. Good to catch up on the other family members. And I look forward to reading Michael, Tylers and Gabriels stories. However so far the best in the series are the ones about the first generation."
5,Ms. Alers does it again!!!,"I thought Ms. Alers forgot about Emily and Christopher, but I was wrong. She has done an excellent job in bringing these fire spirits together at last. She has also shown that forgiveness can be a cleansing of the spirit.The pages just turned themselves as I was caught up in the suspense of this novel. Ms. Alers make me want to believe there is a protector of women out there somewhere. I have read most of Ms. Alers work and I look forward to reading more."
1,"""Tomcats"" need to Bathe","Now what was this movie about? A group of guys vow to never get married and the last man standing wins money? That's pathetic. This movie is degrading towards women and I was outraged. Shannon Elizabeth should've known better. Her best role was in ""American Pie."" Enough said. Utterly terrible. One part I remember in this movie was when a mental patient ate a ball."
3,"Good, but not a winner","I really liked this movie, but after the second time of watching it, it was kinda stupid. But i liked it. IT was funny most throughout the movie, although shannon elizabeth drives me nuts in that movie. But its good, its worth watching it once."
5,great movie,this movie has got to be one of the funniest movies of 2001. if i was siskel and ebert i would give it 2 thumbs up. it is hilarious from beginning to end. so if u got 20 bucks to spend gotta go with tomcats....
2,Good Have Been Better,Not worth owning but fine for rental. Basic plot idea was good but director seemed clueless as how to bring it to the screen. The two main characters are scheming together then without any bridge they are madley in love in less than two days. It gets dumber and dumber as time goes on. You get the feeling that if the director had a clue it migh have actually been pretty good. The story is just all over the place.
1,Worst Movie Ever.,"I can''t believe two things. First, what was I thinking when I rented this piece of garbage, and second, how did this movie ever get made? I'm not going to waste any more time with this critique. Worst movie I've seen to date."
5,This is a masterpiece,"I'm a Richard Bona fan but new to Gerald Toto and Lokua Kanza. I know about the producer Daniel Richard who is also the CEO/President of Universal Jazz France. Daniel is responsible for signing Richard, Salif Keita, Meshell Ndegeocello. My girl and I listen to this and bug out. These are 3 musical friends who did their 4 songs at home and traded files. It sounds like one project and a lot of fun. You can tell they are inspired and respectful of each other. Buy this and tell a friend."
1,the cat's meow - but in a bad way,"I really like all three artists who contributed to this album and have many of their other albums. I know my African music, traditional and contemporary. And I'm into jazz. So I was excited to find this one but after listening to it a couple of times, I am starting to believe that my cat was singing background vocals. Ow, my ears! I can't even quite put my finger on it why. I WANTED to like this album so bad but I just really don't find anything appealing about it. I was looking hard for things to love about it. But I can't. Ah well, there will be takers. I'm just not one of them."
1,Troubling,The book is a good read but I found that I could not finish it...The lesbian angle was disturbing and very offensive. The struggle between the Faith of these women and life is very clear but the choices are always the wrong ones....I felt it made a mockery of catholic life...I was highly offended and fearful that my pre-teen would pick it up....
5,YIKES! THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS FOR THIS BOOK RUIN IT!,"**awesome, thought-provoking read** i wish i hadn't read these reviews before i read ""little altars everywhere"". they ruined parts of the book and almost scared me out of reading it!! but i have to say i enjoyed this read so thoroughly and certainly much more than ""divine secrets..."" (also great!). rebecca wells develops the characters' so much more fully and deeply- i became completely engrossed in the characters lives and experiences. wells has a fabulous way of portraying her characters (w/their good and ugly sides) in such a way that you always get attached to every character and his quirks. true, this book can be kind of dark at times as it deals with some ugly real life struggles and dysfunctionality. however, it is just that aspect of the book that makes it an entirely REAL experience. if you can dig deeper than surface level, you'll find this to be a real gem!! cheers! hope y'all love it as much as i did :)"
3,Not Praying at These Altars,"Rebecca Wells certainly played with my emotions in this book: I began by enjoying the first several chapters and was engaged in Siddalee's character. The switch in perspectives was abrupt and unsettling, and I kept wanting to get back to Siddalee's point of view. (Certainly I have read and liked books with multiple perspectives; I just don't think it was well done here.) Midway through the book I found myself getting bored, but was committed to finishing it since our book group was discussing it. Then, as it grew darker, I think my strong feelings against Vivi interfered with my ability to appreciate the book. I haven't read Divine Secrets and don't feel in any rush to do so now, although I am aware the tone of the second book is quite different. As far as I am concerned, I can't imagine finding anything amusing about Vivi after knowing her story."
2,"Glad I read ""Divine Secrets"" First","I expected ""Little Altars"" to be another laugh-out-loud story with some touching,tender moments like ""Divine Secrets"".. But there was nothing to laugh at with this story, which centers around child abuse and alcoholism. Also, I wasn't a fan of the format of the book, in which each chapter was told from the point of view of a different character ....It read more like character sketches than a story. There was too much disfunction in ""Little Altars"" - and I almost didn't finish it."
3,Better than Divine Secrets of Ya Ya Sisterhood,"I liked this book more than the latter release of the bestseller of Ya Yas. I am repulsed by Vivi and feel sorry for her family and all that know her. She is mean and selfish and traumatized her children. I pity her and find her to be a villainess, an interesting one at that. This book was easier to read, more consistent and I kept the pages turning in comparison to the the Ya Ya book. It's lighter and when you add reading this book with the Ya-Ya book... both books together is a decent time if you have the time. Read both if you must since it's more worthwhile than reading just one or the other."
2,Read this after Divine Secrets,"I am so sad that I read this book. After I finished reading ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"", I wanted to be like them. I loved the characters and actually missed them after I finished the book. Although it is well written and the stories are great ""Little Altars Everywhere"" ruins what I thought of Vivianne and Shep. She is a horrible woman and I am so glad that I read Ya-Ya's first."
3,Not quite as good as Divine Secrets,"After loving Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, I was rather disappointed with this book. At first its very intriguing because now all of Vivi's kids are telling their stories. It starts off light and funny but ends rather dark and disturbing.Granted, you can see throughout both novels that Vivi isn't quite emotionally stable but in Little Alters, she comes out to be a monster of sorts. At the end you leave the book feeling rather icky and upset. If you are into dark books, this is the one for you.Unfortunately, it was a little too dark for me."
2,Little Altars a let down after Ya-Ya,"I read Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood first and loved it. Little Altars was a let down. It was depressing but I kept reading to get to ""the fun part"". I never found it.Read ""Divine Secrets"" and enjoy the memory without botching it up with ""Little Altars""."
4,Left me wanting more.,"I first heard of Rebecca Well's when I saw her on the Rosie O'Donnell show. I have always been captivated by the mystery of Louisiana and I picked up 'Divine secrets"" first. I read that one so fast I could hardly take a breath. I wanted to know more about where this story came from so I picked up ' Little Altars'. I am so glad that I did. I could hardly put it down and I got some strange looks on the bus when I chuckled out loud. The last section of the book is sad but I enjoyed the perspective of all the characters. Once I finished it I wanted to read the ""Divine Secrets"" again. I love Rebecca Well's characters and story telling."
1,I wish I had never read it,"When I first picked up this book I had this nagging feeling that I should read the Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood first, I should have trusted my instincts. Everybody keeps saying what a great book that was and how Little Alters ruined it. Here you are presented with a picture of a hopelessly disfunctional family, and the qeustion is: For what purpose? No resolution or message is conveyed and your left with the horrible vision of Vivi Abbott Walker, an alcoholic, abusive, child molester. In this book the cruel (Vivi) and fake (Sidda) are given the spotlight where the strong (Little Shep)and the noble (Chaney and Willetta) are shoved into the background. This novel seems to thrive and celebrate life crippling disfunction."
1,Can we give this book a Minus rating????,"AWFUL simply put the book was awful. I love the Divine Secrets book and read that one first. Little altars was a waste of paper in my opinion. I don't quite understand how a character (Vivi Abbcott) protraited so richly in the Divine Secrets was so extreamly evil, cruel and hateful in little altars. Frankly I wish I had never read little altars. It turned the slightly demenented characters so like in Divine Secrets and pretty much destroyed them. -10 in my book"
4,It was pretty good.,"I read Little altars everywhere because I really enjoyed the movie. This book was good, but I think the author might have described things too much at times, and it just dragged on. It was also a little confusing at one or two parts. It didn't leave me feeling changed at the end though. I though i was rather... unfinished! I'm reading Dive Secrets now, and hope it will be more fufilling!"
5,I couldn't put it down,"This book took me on a magnificent journey. I went inside the lives of the Walker family and felt the hot summer weather of Louisianna. The book is broken down in such a way that it makes it impossible to put down. By knowing what each character is experiencing and thinking it puts you on a very intimate level with them. Rebecca Wells brings to life the innocent summers of youth and the hardships of love. I can't wait to see what awaits me in the ""Ya Ya Sisterhood"". Two thumbs up for Little Alters Everywhere!"
4,Well written but ......,"Little Alters Everywhere is a well written and initially funny book. I was really excited when I started reading it and began recommending it to all my friends and coworkers. However, I have to tell you that it takes a somewhat unexpected dark tone on towards the end that sort of bummed me out after the humor incorporated into the first part of the story. I know a lot of people will disagree with me. For many I'm sure that the darker tones at the end of this novel made the story more appealing. However, for my tastes the book took the turn from day to night a bit too fast. I still recommend this book because it is really much better than a great deal of junk that's published. However, I don't think I'll go on to read the prequel, The Divine Secrets Of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood. (As if you care.)"
3,Rebecca Wells shows potential,"Little Alter Everywhere shows serious potential in her first novel. The story can't decide if it wants to be funny or sad, like life, and we can't decide if the characters are good or bad, like life! There are many inconsistancies in the novel that have to do with facts and dominant personality: Is Teensy a Ya Ya or what? This a good example of a book who takes over the author, a book that's not well thought out or well set up. This author, however, will get better with time, she shows great potential, if she just will stop on occasion, and remind herself of the ""purpose"" of her novel, even if the purpose is that it has no purpose, which I doubt is true, and tie it together."
5,WHAT A WONDERFUL READ!,"As a South African who know very little about the South of America, this book left me with a wonderful insight into Southern family life in the early '60's. The dialogue is very entertaining and it is one of those books that you just can't put down. Congrats to Rebecca Wells for a fantastic novel! I can hardly wait for the next one."
5,If This Book Were Champagne It Would Be 5 Star,"Fast and lively. How anyone could give this book less than four stars is beyond me. I read straight through and every time I put it down, I rushed back. I'd compare it to Michael Lee West's CRAZY LADIES. Those two books could be kissing cousins. My favorite part in ALTARS was where Buggy, the old grandma, had that crazy poodle with the ""babies"". I also liked the part where Sidda got her hair cut off by the drunken ""ya ya's"". Another favorite time was when Vivi drove the station wagon over the flag pole at Girl Scout camp. Opening this book is like opening a treasure chest."
2,"Look Great in the Picture, but beware....","These looked great in the picture, but beware....These shoes have the longest point I have ever seen looks great on the side even on, but looking directly down they are witches shoes. With the nicest kitten heels and they are really roomy. I am a 9 1/2 to 10 and I bought these in a size 9 and the fit great. I think I am keeping them for Halloween for $19, what's the harm? If you are very trendy at work, these were last year's trend of pointy toes. This year it looks like round toe's and Mary Janes and don't forget Platforms! Anyway, that's my 2 cents on this purchase"
1,Very old and wont work on modern OS,My brother bough it as a gift for my wife. She runs Vista but doesn't care about graphics much. The card would work but the drivers are faulty and not properly supported. I should have red the fine print this is a very old board!
4,At her peak.,"The mix that came together to make this such a special album were the producing and writing team of Ashford and Simpson, talented session musicians, some wonderful songs and Diana Ross in great voice. There are some weak songs on this cd, but overall the sum is greater than the parts. And that CD cover, never has Diana Ross looked so sweet, sensual and lovely. This is where Motown met disco but never forgot the groove, the beat and the hooks."
5,A Must Read For Anyone Interested in Childbirth,A wonderful story of a midwife's life work that twists and turns with incredible birth stories and a deep care that every pregnant woman should have. Beautifully written - a must-read for anyone interested in birth.
2,Not a good fit for ES330,ACDelco A2933C Air Filter was impossible to install on Lexus ES330. Had to spend a lot of time before succeeded. Tried an old OEM filter - installs like a charm. Evidently some ACDelco filter's features have a slightly different size which made an installation a very tough task. Not a good fit for ES330
2,What a shame!,"I love monster fights, I really do and I tried to like this one but unfortunately it is tooo cheap and boring to be a good b-grade movie like Crocodile. The part that I was excited about is the fight but it is so quick and poorly done. When I turned it off I was really disappointed. The effects could of been done better too. Let's hope this director doesn't get lazy on the amazingly awesome b-movie Dinocroc vs. Supergator."
2,Sci-Fi Channel does it again,"Another entry in the Sci-Fi channel's series of giant monster movies. The effects in this one are below average, much inferior to KOMODO. There is the usual techno-babble explanation for the existence of these giant predators, and as usual it makes little if any sense. More of the standard ""Don't mess with Mother Nature,"" and ""Anything the armed forces are involved in is evil,"" the message of almost all sci-fi/horror films Hollywood releases. While I enjoyed this more than Sci-Fi's last ""Versus"", BOA VS PYTHON, it is small comfort. The movie never really delivers on the build-up as it meanders aimlessly to an unsatisfying ending."
2,Confusing and Scattered,"I have been practicing Yoga for almost a year now and wanted to try something new so I picked up this video. The teacher does not give good instructions on the poses which is extremely confusing, especially when you can't be looking at the TV. It causes the student to constantly interrupt their practice just to try to figure out what you are supposed to be doing. The instructor also jumped around an awful lot, and the exercises did not flow well together. I would not purchase this video again. Rather, I would highly recommend ""Total Yoga"" with Tracey Rich as the instructor."
5,I got results,"I've used this tape (now DVD) for several years in combination with walking/jogging and have experienced satisfying results. Not only am I more limber, but I've developed long and lean muscles. I've taken years of yoga and dance, and feel that this tape is a pretty good combination of strength, stretch and balance. I've even brought it with me on vacation, because I think it's a nice way to start off the day!"
2,"Love Thomas, but have issues with this DVD","My kids love Thomas, and have many of the vhs tapes. I was looking forward to this dvd for the typical reasons (better picture, easier to navigate...). Unfortunately you CANNOT skip over the 5 MINUTES of COMMERCIALS at the outset of this DVD, which negates one of the key advantages of DVD. This is especially galling for a children's product."
3,Quick. Concise. Informative,"After reading this novel for my Enlgish class, I would like to share my thoughts. For people that are looking for a book to catch them up on Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology, in a quick period of time, this is your book. It gets to the point and just re-tells what the previous writers have. But if you want to take your time and read mythology with passion and time, choose another book. Hamilton just tells it as it is, although if some stories are vivd, it would probably be thanks to Ovid."
3,Informative but dull,"Although Hamilton's compilation is the most concise yet comprehensive study I have yet encountered, it lacks the personability and excitement of Greek mythology."
4,napa high millionwordproject,"Mythology by Edith Hamilton is a wonderful book for anyone who loves the stories of gods and heroes as much as I do. After not studying the Greek and Roman myths for about two years in school, I thought I had lost my love for the stories. But, when I read this book about the stories of myth and ledged, my mind is once again filled with awe and wonder. Reading about how people in ancient Greece and Rome explained how things happened, such as with Hera and Argus and how the peacock got it's eyes, and with Demeter and Hades and how the seasons began, is a truly wonderful reading experience. However, there are so many different stories in this book, it starts to become hard to tell one from the other. That is one thing I disliked about the book Mythology. True, they were separated and placed into categories, but I felt like there were to many stories/legends crammed into one book. However, over all it was a truly wonderful book."
3,Not Too Thrilled...,"Hmm. Wasn't really thrilled with this book. I found it to be a bit dry and boring. Hamilton has a way of cramming so much plot into each story. Consequently, something is lost in translation..."
3,pretty good,"A fairly good introduction to mythology. The sources aren't always followed as closely as the author claims, and to contradict the author, OVID RULES!"
3,Analytic Mythological Research,"Although the book is a great source for numerous popular mythological stories it has some serious drawbacks. The book lacks personality as Hamilton gives a polite discourse upon the historical origins of the story being told. Also the writting is fairly simple and, at times, very impersonal as the writter often breaks up the flow of the story to add personal comentary on the thoughts of charachers or even to debate the historical origins and evaluate which popular version of the tale is better."
2,Informative but DRY,"The information gets 4 stars, but the writing style put me to sleep, so that gets a 1. I'm just settling on giving it a 2."
5,"Waylon, wayback when",I was just getting in to music. I listened to this on vinyl on a 10$ mono record player. I went out and bought every Waylon record I could find. No easy feat for a 12 yr old. I now have all but a few on CD. This album brings back so many memories. In my opinion this is Waylon's best album.
5,WOW!!!,I have to say Everclear is my all time favorite band...no one will be able to top them ever. I was so happy to learn that they had two albums comming out this year. The first one of the set was great but a little dissapointing to people who are used to their darker side. This album really is great and rivals So much For the After glow as my my favorite from everclear. I bought it the day it came out and was not dissapointed. Everyone who loves everclear needs to go out and buy this Cd it is truly great.
3,A little rough but true Everclear,"A lot like the first ""Songs"" but a little bit rougher, not quite as polished. But like most Everclear you need to listen to the lyrics to get a deep appreciation for the music. The quality of the recoprding seems not to be so terrific, but in general it is good (not great) classic Everclear."
2,Could use much higher grade of steel.,"Don't like bad mouthing a product but when I buy a working tool I have expectations. Hadn't used them a week before the blades were dragging and the spring would not return to full open. Annoying when you have acres of pruning to do. I'm a bit anxious about making any un-directed adjustments to the screws I see. Can just picture parts flying everywhere with no instructions on how to re-assemble. I'm typical man, so if it came with paperwork of any kind, it went out with the next mornings trash. At the reputation and price I'd hoped for better. If nothing else label the adjustments."
5,"love them, what more can I say!","Love these, high quality, you get what you pay for, can't go wrong, pricey but worth it! Arrived quickly and well packaged."
1,Very Disappointed.,"I was very disappointed in this. It has high reviews but the item I got was nearly useless. If I cut 4 or 5 stems the plant juices will cause the blades to stick together and I will have to use both hands to force them open. Then the next thing I cut they will stick closed again. Considering the other reviews I can only think that they are making this much more cheaply than they did in the past and the spring that opens the blades is much weaker. Anyway, it is useless. And I even bought the leather sheath for it. Which shows that sometimes even 96 positive reviews can be wrong. And leaves me still needing a decent pruner."
3,Prone to rust - otherwise good,"Bought these online after seeing the amazingly positive reviews - and indeed they're powerful & precise, chopping through woody branches with ease.Was a bit disappointed a few weeks later, though, to see the blades accumulating rust, and roughly dragging together - I wiped them off fairly well after using them, but I guess not quite thoroughly enough.Seems like for a tool made to chop moist plant stems, a more rust-proof metal would have been a good design choice, especially considering the hefty price."
2,Julia has done BETTER,"Brad Pitt I could care less about.Julia Roberts has always been theactress that deserves so much.Butdidn't make the grade here.Erin Brokovich was much much betterfor Julia Roberts.I should have skipped Mexican.It had all the ingrediants to makeit the best movie that Julia hasbeen in, but failed to accomplishwhat was needed to make it a hit.If you are looking for time tokill,then just rent it.I wouldn't.If you are a big Julia Roberts fanthen please skip this one.Julia dropped the ball big time."
1,I'd rather go to the dentist...,"This could possibly be one of the worst movies in recent years. The Mexican is a perfect example that 2 good lead actors don't always work well together. I like Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts isn't too bad either, but together, they just don't work. Not one element in this movie works. The chemistry between the Pitt and Roberts is non-existent. My girlfriend fell asleep half way through this movie. Normally, that isn't a big deal. Except we were watching it in the middle of the afternoon! ..."
3,A funny film,"This story went from one extreme to another and I found something to laugh about in every direction. I imagine Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts were out of energy after all the exercise! I do recommend it for adults, but not children."
4,DVD Purchase,"I have no complaints about the condition of the product I purchased, as it viewed perfectly when I watched it. However, and perhaps this was my oversight, I was disappointed that it came without the original case when the reason I purchased it is because of it's Like New status. Otherwise, the product shipped quickly and works... I just felt mislead."
2,A helluva disappointment!,"In my view, the star status of Pitt and Roberts and the magazine reviews that spoke of ""A two hour adrenaline rush"" were rather misleading. Were the stars using this movie as a ""filler-in"" between bigger projects? This is a long movie and there ain't no adrenaline, folks!"
4,Entertaining screwball romance,"""The Mexican"" follows the arcs of one dimwit and two marginally brighter bulbs in pursuit of the fabulous titular weapon. Brad Pitt pulls off the dim bulb role ably, but he does manage to seem just smart enough to stay alive in his difficult liine of work. Julia Roberts's rather loony rendition of Pitt's pyscho-babble enamored girlfriend teeters just on the edge of irritating, but Roberts's natural charm keep her in the audiences' good graces.The movie's real saving grace is James Gondolfini's delirously improbable character, who truly makes the movie worth seeing and adds the best entertainment value.Avoid this movie if you like very linear plot construction (a la French Kiss, Chinatown) and don't like disjointed cutting (Pulp Fiction, Traffic)"
4,More than expected,"This movie is probably one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. Its not really a chick flick like many people are thinking and at times its quite funny. This ones a good mix of action, romance and comedy.This movie is one of the few in which Brad Pitt has done some great acting (Fight Club, 12 Monkeys, Se7en to name a few others). This is probably one of Julia Roberts' more mediocre performences.The downside is that the movie is pretty long... needlessly long I might add, and isn't one of those movies you see a lot.The DVD has some great features: about 7 or so deleted scenes, commentary which I haven't checked out and a making of featurette.My Advice: The packed DVD and the good movie are reason enough to buy this one but its a rent first in my opinion"
4,Pitt pitted with Roberts,"Pitt plays a hopeless, screw-up mob grunt, in love with a just-as-hopeless, still-finding-herself girlfried, played by Roberts. Pitt is on the quest for The Mexican, the most beautiful gun in all of Mexico, or probably in all the world. The supporting actors are hilarious with these two. It's good to see Pitt and Roberts try a hand at romantic comedy. The plot about the gun is infinitely fascinating to someone like me who used to live near the Texas-Mexico border, and the movie brought back fond memories of Mexico. More romantic than ""Traffic,"" more comical than the guy who took me on a date to Mexico. I used to know a guy who looked like Pitt, so, I can't own this movie. It would give me the willies. I give the movie 4 stars. I can't take Pitt enough to give it 5 stars."
2,Once Upon a Time in Mexico,"This movie got some attention since it has two big Hollywood stars in it, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. However, it`s not too enticing or convincing, just a merely entertaining mix with bits of romantic comedy, thriller, road movie, action and an offbeat feel that tries to reach cult status. It`s a decent effort, but the characters aren`t very intriguing (Pitt plays a dumb pretty boy, Roberts is in another bland role and only James Gandolfini, the best element here, truly convinces as an interesting gay hitman), the plot is full of ups and downs and it runs for way too long. At parts it even comes close to Tarantino/ Robert Rodriguez territory, yet as a whole it`s too muddled and uneven to suceed. Director Gore Verbinski offers a couple of nice shots of Mexico with good atmosphere and an appropriatte soundtrack, making for a mildly enjoyable cinematic experience. Still, this is just fast-food cinema overall. Not memmorable, but worth watching once.A decent rental."
3,Tony Soprano as you have never seen him before,I didn't really have much of an issue with this movie up until James Gandolfini and Brad Pitt changing the tire. I didn't understand the circumstances and there was no explanation about what James Gandolfini's character was really doing. Maybe I just missed something. I thought the ending could have been better as well. Hardened criminal changed forever by a story. I really liked the movie up until the last 30 minutes or so. It's worth a rent.
