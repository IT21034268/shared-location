4,Excellent rechargeables,"With all the different names and types of rechargeables out there, I just couldn't decide which ones I should buy. I decided to go with an established name like Sony and I wasn't disappointed. I was so pleased with these that I bought the AA 2500 mAh NiMH batteries as well. I never run out of fresh batteries now since I keep a pair charged while I'm using the other pair. These last longer than I expected and can keep up with my digital camera. I recommend both AAA 900 mAh and AA mAh NiMH batteries. It still doesn't replace the alkaline batteries but do you really wanna keep buying those expensive batteries?"
4,Really good batteries...,"They're really good batteries, they come in a nice package and look resistent.They last more than normal batteries, plus they're sturdy, and don't look like cheap ones."
2,Batteries died within 4 months of using them,Bought these for two cordless phone handsets to replace the original batteries that lasted for a year. These would no longer take a charge after four months. I am currently shopping for another set.
5,Learn To Pack!,"The batteries were good but the packing was very, very bad. Picture this......11x14 bubblined envelope. 3-4 pack of AAA batteries loose in side. UPS them and what do you get??...........Well, I only recieved 1 of the 3 packs because the weight of the others cut the edge of the envelope and probably made it to the home of a UPS employee. How dumb can someone be and pack batteries loosely in a bubble envelope?? The rest of the problem is too long to write about. Hey AMAZON, I know you don't have to be smart to be a shipper but let's at lease have some common sense."
3,Disapointed in life of battery,"I have a MP3 player that I use the batteries for. I was going through about 1 regular AAA battery every 10 - 14 days. Then I bought these rechargables. The last 2 rechargable batteries have only lasted me for about 7 days. I listen to my MP3 fairly often (I would estimate about 1 hr a day or less, plus time to ocassionally synch files), so I would say I have gotten roughly about 8 - 12 hours of usage per battery. I hope to get more out of the others going forward."
2,bought a 1/30/2011. no longer works,only 1 of the 4 cells in the pack I bought about 2 years ago works now. Is that reasonable durability?
2,Go with another brand,"I just bought these to use with my wireless headphones. I have to say, they hold a charge pretty well, and for the price of premium batteries, well worth the price. Highly recommended.Edit: My review was premature. After a couple of months, the batteries stopped holding a charge properly. Even when freshly charged, they do not have enough juice in them for more than a couple of hours of use. I would got with the Samsung brand."
3,percentage is misleading: too much sugar,"I noticed this chocolate was much, much sweeter than I was used to. After checking the nutrition facts, I found out why: Lindt's 85% has about half as much sugar per serving, as this supposedly 88% chocolate.The fair trade is nice, but they need to make a version with much less sugar or I can't eat it."
5,Great read for WWII fiction fans,"I love reading WWII fiction and have been a fan of the Thoenes's series for years. Tricia's account of what happened in Austria during that era and the atrocities of the concentration camps is compelling. I visited the Holocaust Museum in DC in 2003 and reading her novel was like going back for a visit to the rooms with the chilling history of death and torture. Though not grossly graphic, she gets the truth of the sadism and inhumane thinking of that era across without sounding preachy. Also, the plot kept my interest and the characters were well developed. I found it to be very true to life. She did a great job weaving a fictional tale around a true life account of someone else's suffering. I keep thinking about the story after I've read it and that is unusual for me. From Dust and Ashes (first in the series) also sticks with me, but Night Song surpasses even that wonderfully written story. I can't wait for her third book to come out."
4,the best movie about sharks,If you are a shark lover that is the tape you need. Magnificent scenes and wonderful sounds. All you want to know about sharks you will find it in this tape. the best thing is you will have a close look of the beautiful animal.
1,Broken multiple times,"I am sure that this scale would work great had it been delivered intact. I returned it once to get a new one and the second one was broken even worse.If you need a scale quickly, I would not trust Amazon to deliver a working one."
1,Terrible,"I don't really read ""hood"" books, but one boring night at work I had nothing to read and this book was on the book shelf. What a total waste of time. The story is dumb and the legal stuff was totally unrealistic. It read like a teenager wrote it, grammatical errors and all. Definitely do not spend your money on this trash. Amazon needs to get a ""0"" star rating"
3,Fast read,"this is a good book and it is funny, it is a quick read, shows you to always keep your friends CLOSE!!!"
4,Surprisingly good interpretations of classic themes,"First and foremost, these are not original themes. Considering that, I am myself amazed that I am giving this album four stars. However, these are very good interpretations of the originals that stand very well on their own merits. Particularly good are the dynamic versions of ""Hang 'em High"", ""Joe Kidd"", and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales.""Granted, if I could ever find these themes as originals, I would prefer them in that format. However, this is one of the very few occasions in which I have encountered remakes that I respect musically and don't feel cheated by."
2,Boring,I realize there is a following for this series of mysteries but I am not among them. I found this book predictable and boring. The characters are shallow and the plot lacking imagination.
2,Boring,"on me, this is boring, fading very quickly and never very interesting. Recommend sampling this before buying. it is so complex, probably different on everyone."
3,UNUSUAL SEXUAL BEHAVIORS,"Robert J. Stoller, MDPerversion:The Erotic Form of Hatred(New York: Pantheon, 1975)(reprint: London, UK: Karnac Books, 1986) 240 pagesStoller takes another look at several unusual sexual behaviors(homosexuality, cross-dressing, transsexualism, pornography),but he does not successfully formulate a comprehensive theory.Childhood trauma, resulting in hostility and hatred, probably explainsonly some of the unusual sex-scripts touched on in this book.Some historical beginnings of exploration into imprinted sex-scripts.Search the Internet for other books:""VARIATIONS OF SEX & GENDER BIBLIOGRAPHY"".James Leonard Park, author ofVariations of Sex & Gender:Six Phenomena Frequently Confused."
2,Pity,"Pity this book is out of print, for it is worth remembering that many millions of non Jews were enslaved and persecuted by the Nazis, the majority of whom were (as recently scholarship confirms) Ukrainians."
4,A Good Resume Guide,"A good resume guide, but I wouldn't say it's a killer. Not sure if it actually helps, but it definitely strengthen my writting skills."
2,Marksman Grip ROX!,"This launcher is one of the best! It has a light for accuracy, and it gives you a better grip for a better launch."
4,the ancient one review,I read this book when i was in 6th grade so it has been a LONG time since i've read it considering now i am 28! I remember i LOVED it and i wanted to purchase this book to re-read it now that i'm much older. should be fun! This was my favorite book for a long time!
5,This was one of the best books I ever read.,"The Ancient One, by T. A. Barron, was a compellingnovel, and one of the best I've ever read. It waswonderful whether it was read along withHeartlight, its prequel, or by itself. This bookteaches children about preserving our naturalresources, because they can be very precious. Katemakes another appearance as an ordinary girl wholoves softball and gets herself into some prettyextraordinary situations. Everyone can identifywith her, and that's important in a main character.This was another good job for T. A. Barron."
2,The Ancient One,"As a YA literature teacher I read these books with the eyes of my students who are in this case eighth graders. I found this novel to be quite slow. Barron takes far to long to get to the crux of the matter. The characters are believable enough but lack a certain ""punch"". I am a big T.A. Barrron fan but, I would nopt recommend this novel to my students."
3,Generally good with one big flaw,"This is generally an excellent summary of the cogent arguments against antitrust laws. As such, it should have a prominent place on the bookshelf of every advocate of free markets.However, the third chapter, contributed by Richard Salsman, is flawed and should be read carefully and critically. First, Mr. Salsman incorrectly identifies ""profits"" and ""production"" as one and the same. In fact, although the two are related, and both are important to the operation of the free market, their relationship is not that of an ""identity."" Second, Mr. Salsman, in a mere footnote, dismisses the theory of profits propounded by George Reisman, Professor Emeritus at Pepperdine and author of the comprehensive work ""Capitalism,"" as an inconsequential effort. Readers should read Reisman's work for themselves before taking Salsman's criticisms seriously."
5,Excellent and Overdue Collection,"This collection is quite satisfying for the long-term Tori fan and casual listener alike. A lot of the tracks' sound quality has been improved from the re-mastering, giving it a new accent and flavor while retaining the original essence of the Tori we all love. The addition of the beautiful new ""Angels"" and ""Snow Cherries from France"" is more than welcome and, surprisingly, blend quite well with the other pieces.Well executed is the quality of this recording (especially the older pieces from ""Little Earthquakes"") and the unification of songs from a 12+ yr old catalog. The version of ""Way Down"" is breathtaking, but the re-mix version of ""Professional Widow"" was unexpected; I would have opted for a re-recorded version.This CD necessitates a ""close"" listen the first time around to completely appreciate the modifications in instrumentation and harmonization. The DVD tracks are also fabulous - and it's a real treat to see Tori on the stage doing such heartfelt tunes."
4,"Tori is always good, but the regular albums are better","This is not a bad choice for someone who is looking for an intro to Tori, or for a diehard fan who will take pleasure in hearing the subtle difference in the remastered tracks. However, I do think a better Tori Amos experience is to start with Little Earthquakes and work through the albums chronologically (skipping To Venus And Back). I am a serious Tori fan - I enjoyed listening to this album, but I doubt I will listen to it often. As a general matter, I like the original versions of the songs better."
5,Awesome buy!,Tori is amazing and this cd catches some of her best songs. I would definitely recommend this cd!!!!
5,Tales of a Lifetime,"With such produced favourites as Mary to new goodies as Angels. B Sides like Sweet Dreams are beautiful to hear without screaming fans in the background. Tori Amos has put forth a major effort in colaborating this album.In this is a filing system for the stages of life/music which Tori has been through. She has also put forth a lot of our favourites goldies with new adaptations or hard to find versions.All together it is a fabulous piece or artwork that protrays Tori as a Musician, artist, poet, mother and friend."
3,Missing Tales,"Well, I waiting for a ""hits"" collection and this is what I get. I think the remastering is interesting if anything else. The unreleased tracks are great, but my big question is where are the harpsichord tracks from Pele? The only tracks she picked from Pele don't show her amazing talents with many instruments. This CD could have used ""Caught A Lite Sneeze"" or ""Talula"" or anything from that amazing album. Another strange thing is the DVD. What is the deal with the sound. I can't get it to stop sounding like crap. It sounds as if the volume is so high it is distorting, can you say ""Sound Check first."" Oh well, at least I got it as a gift and it is another addition to my already large Tori collection."
2,ok for nonearsw/feet,"This is a good cd, I guess if you havent got anything else from tori. As all earrs withfeeet know (EWF are her fans...her TRUE fans)all of tories cds are worth listening to. I only wish she would have included ""The Manitee"" a song my band, Life's Hero, gave her to record. Oh well, maybe next time around...so I would say that if youre an ears with feet dont get this, but if your not an ears with feet, then get this."
5,The History of A Woman,"After more than a decade of continuos work Tori Amos finally presents us with a long waited collection of her songs, not hits as she often says but music that tells the history of this woman and through hers the history of her fans (which essentially identify with what she sings), the history of a decade and of the people who tried to make it more like a fairytale."
4,a review for ears with feet...,"Don't get me wrong, I'm as big an ear as any ear with feet has ever been, however, I can't divulge the full five stars for this one. It sort of has a rushed feeling to it, much like her last two. The remastering of most the tracks had created an interesting new take on songs like ""God"" and ""Way down"". But some, like ""spark"", ""silent"", and ""jackie's"" seem just extra stringy and sans reverb... ""Snow cherries"" could be tori's next ""new sound"" and is absolutely beautiful. Everything she's ever done has usually been different from what she's done before, and we've come to expect this from her. I don't know if she's still searching and prehaps her muse is silent, or if it's just because she's moved from the self-burning flames of maiden-temptress to the hearth warming coals of motherhood, but there is a calm surfacing in her music. The fire is there it's just a different sort. I wonder where we'll go next?"
3,Why tamper with the classics?,"I've been a Tori fan for almost 8 years now, and the woman can do no wrong by me. I was happy to see that a greatest hits collection was finally being released, but why she chose to ""recondition"" the songs is kinda hazy to me. The only differences I can tell is that she took out a majority of the other instrumentations on the songs, made the piano louder, and totally killed any and all reverb effect on her vocals. The effect left me feeling like something was missing. The songs lost a lot of their spark. The re-recorded songs shine brighter than the originals, and ""Angels"" and ""Snow Cherries from France"" are gorgeous. This is a staple for any Tori newbie who really wants a rounded selection of stuff, but to a die hard fan, if you must have it, get it. Otherwise, you can pass this one up and put the other discs on random in the cd changer."
2,The DVD is worthless,I bought this CD/DVD at Target and had to go back 3 times because the DVD won't play. Did anyone else have this problem? The DVD I have still won't play so I feel as though I got ripped off.
3,relevant for today,"this book was a tough read but once you stop getting hung up on the names from the causcus region and get into the flow it becomes a very timely journey. the roots of todays conflict in the area of the causcus, and the divisions between islam and christianity emerge loud and clear...trudge through it and you will be rewarded...."
2,Not recommended for its scholarship,"While researching for books about the Mongol conquests, I came upon this book first. I read several original academic reviews of the book (e.g. Choice, the journal for university libraries) and they indicated that Chambers's scholarship was not reliable. Instead the reviews steered me to the book by Saunders. There is not much on the Mongols, but I thought readers should be aware that of the few books available, some might be more useful than others."
3,Great grill,I bought this as duplicate to one that I already have as a gift but was disappointed that it didn't come with the griddle grill. I called and they don't make those griddle grills anymore which was convenenient for making eggs or pancakes. The plate that it comes with drains the grease off but you don't want to drain the egg or pancake batter off. Otherwise love the grill! It is big enough and easy to make burgers or chicken breasts!
2,Short cord.,"I bought it in hopes of using it with a regular Mac. The USB cord was too short, and because it wasn't one that could be replaced with a longer one, I needed to return it."
4,"Works great, needs longer cord","It does exactly what it's supposed to do, my only complaint is the USB cord is so short (a few inches) that it can't sit cleanly on top of my Airport Extreme Base station. Still though, gets the job done for hooking up my printer and external hard drive to my network."
5,Bye bye poisonous water,"Got this to take the crap out of my tap water. It is expensive and takes hours to make a pot but after learning about the dangerous junk in public tap water, it is worth it. My friends even make comments about how good it tastes."
1,dangerous unit,"water seaped into the electrical base and blew out the lower unit causing a burned out socket and burnt wires in the unit. Obviously a defect in the manufacturing. Would not replace the lower unit. Was told to buy a new unit, it would be cheaper to a brand new one than just the container unit. This is a fire hazzard."
1,Nice distiller,"Actually I like this distiller, it works nicely and the water tastes light years better than Phoenix tap water. I rated it one star to get a little attention because FYI, the bottle that comes with it is a #7 type plastic which contains BPA which is a little controversial. Putting warm water into it is a little mentally dissonant as one reason for going to distiller is to reduce chemicals that one drinks. I don't know if BPA is really an environmental threat (it probably isn't), but just call it informed consent. I have the water drain into a glass container that I have which isn't as big as the plastic bottle that it comes with."
5,was a little worried at first,"i bought the product despite some reviews of it malfunctioning and being too noisy. but after using it for a month to distill water every 2-3 days i must say it has performed well. the control to start is foolproof. the unit stops automatically when it is done. i hardly have to worry when it is doing its job. it is a tad loud but when it's in the kitchen but when i'm in my room working, can hardly hear the noise. easy to clean with the residue cleaner provided. water taste good. a bit bigger and heavier than expected but am not complaining."
5,Missed being at the lead of the last revolution? 2nd chance!,Remember reading about Codd and Date's RDB theory and wishing you had been there at the start? Most of us just read about innovations after they've occurred. Rarely do we get to take an active role. This book provides all the ingredients for those who want to get involved in what could be an extraordinary new phase of business development. Read this one now!
3,"Good basic bending manual, but incomplete","A good book for general conduit bending, but woefully inadequate for professional concentric bending."
3,Keep track of rainbow crystal bearers with this book.,"Can never remember exactly what Game Machine Joe's transformed evil self looked like? Well, look no further than ""Sailor Moon: Friends and Foes."" Not only does it show each rainbow crystal bearer's transformed self, but it lists each ""scout's"" favorite animal and attack phrase as well. This isn't a book for a research paper on Sailor Moon (unless you are cataloging all the differences between the original and Dic's version,) but it does give you some basic information. The artwork is bright and eye-catching and I was happy to see a picture of Queen Serenity (the character who best keeps the graceful beauty of Takeuchi sensei's original artwork) and a nice shot of the Moon Kingdom."
5,Hayden's Ghost Girl is the best!,"Torey Hayden has once again proven herself as an amazing writer. This book will keep your attention until the last page is read. Hayden manages to show all elements of human compassion and love, so much so, that the reader loves her characters tremendously as well. This book is amazing!"
5,Incredible,"This book was absolutely amazing. I read it first in high school and recently reread it, only to discover that it was equally good the second time around. I appreciated Torey Hayden's creative use of language (which really helped the story come alive), as well as her honesty. She described times when she said exactly the right thing as well as times when she messed up. She also resisted the urge to give a neatly tied up conclusion, defering to the truth that real life tends to be messy. This was a story that should not have to be told, because children should not have to endure such a life. However, since many children do undergo this suffering, I greatly appreciated the chance to read an account that was open about the horror of it, yet sensitive in its presentation."
4,emotionell,The story about Jadie- an eight year old girl who lives in a small town somewhere in mid Amerika.Torey arrives to this town after an impulse to change her job. In the school in which she is to work there's a small class which contains children in about the same agegroupe. They all suffer from some kind of mental disorder. One of the children is Jadie. She refuses to speak and acts very strange. Apparently she knows things not ment for an eight year old. Torey makes her talk and as their relationship grows the girl reveils bits of her world. Torey is thrown into a battle between siance and superstition. When Torey realises that the stories might not be just fiction she finally contacts the right authorities. A long investigation begins but even after this no real answear appears to the numerous questions.
1,Faulty product,"The 2 movies that were on the DVD's were timeless classics. However the product was faulty and the DVD'z contained only 2 of the movies instead of the 4 movies promised.Amazon gave me another copy, but it too had the same problem. Amazon swiftly provided me with a refund but I'm not aware that the problem has been rectified."
2,?,The seaweed is very fake and they're wings look like they come from thespecial effects section of a LifeCam/Webcam. That's all i have to say.
3,Sabadazo!,"I had been looking for it under another title: SABADAZO! I am glad I found it.Julio Aleman, an important politician, defies Antonio Raxel, who is his aid and goes out to live the real life's adventures outside his bubble, and there, in the night of this México he didn't know, faces along with his new ''friend'' Roberto ""flaco"" Guzman, all kinds of perils and misfortunes. Gaming in Garibaldi, prostitutes/thieves who take all he has of value, then he spends a day in jail, and ends up eating something strange in a stand on the street. To finish that ''adventure'' he takes his new friend as his personal assistant, since he knows more of the real problems that affect real people like him, the average mexican, and that is good to his political campaign.I found it little interesting, like one of many other movies trying to reflect the real México, to people who have lived under a rock, maybe?..."
3,"Good Book, Title Slightly Misleading","I agree this is a quick and enjoyable read. It's one Awo's account of how the Orisa have brought physical healing, deliverance from harm, forgiveness for transgressions and understanding in living. However I bought the book SPECIFICALLY because it mentioned Ori, Ifa and Orisa worshipin the title and to my disappointment this book is a memoir, and provides no instructional material, historical background, or introduction of spiritual sciences to light. He merely choosing to refer to our spiritual practices in this way, which in retrospect is excellent - but just confusing as a book title."
1,it doesn't stand up!,"the figure looks great, but Hawkman is horribly unbalanced and simply doesn't stand up for any length of time. it's incredibly frustrating."
2,So-so Quality,"This thread is very beautiful and shiny to use. However the strands come apart whether you want them to or not so it's best if you only need one strand. It also gets knotted and frayed VERY easily so one must be VERY gentle with it. All in all, it has a gorgeous effect but is SO frustrating!"
4,"Insightful and Interesting, this Book is Quite Good!","Sometimes the best way of getting yourself out of a rut is to see how other people did it. That's what this book is all about.I enjoyed many of the stories that were featured about people who reinvented themselves after the age of 40. Let's face it, change is difficult under the best of circumstances, but when you've established yourself in a field or profession, it's ten times harder.This book has good advice and the chapter on Getting Out of a Slump is worth the price of the entire book. There is also a good resource guide for further assistance.I'd actually give this book 4.5 stars if that were an option, but the numerous typos and editing problems were a bit of a distraction."
2,A better American Spectator feature than book subject,"P. J. O'Rourke is one of the best political satirists of this age. I recently read the latest book to bear his name, though it was not entirely written by him. ""The Enemies List"" began as a spleen venting feature in The American Spectator several years ago. This book consists of lists of people or organizations who pose a threat to freedom and personal responsibility as judged by P.J. and those who contributed. Reading the book was a chore. I finished it more as a testiment to finishing that which I start, than entertainment and information. There are some chuckles in the book. If the reader is just learning about Mr. O'Rourke, I highly reccomend ""Parliament of Whores,"" as ""The Enemies List"" is more a tribute than enjoyable reading"
2,Disappointed,"I recently purchased a Stotts Pilates SPX Home Reformer and this DVD came with it. I have taken lessons on the Reformer, but it has been a couple of years. Although I found the DVD informative and a refresher on the different elements of the machine and its workings, I found the video less then satisfactory when it came to the actual workout. When working the lower body the video focused primarily on the upper body so I could not see how the exercisers feet were positioned. Many of the shots taken were from a side angle as well. Would have been nice to see the exercisers feet perhaps photographed from above so that you could see the whole person and the reformer together while performing the exercises. The videographer did a poor job centering the people in the video as well. I was very disappointed in this DVD and I am going to be e-mailing Stotts with my critic. The machine itself is great."
1,Lil stupid mall,It is horribleYou can't put it togetherit keeps falling downpieces get lostI hate it
1,Bratz spent more on advertising then making this toy,"This was the number one item from Santa for my 7 yr old daughter. We bought and put it together, but it falls apart. My daughter now just leaves it to the side so she doesn't break it. The dolls do not fit into the stores.I am going to get some super glue and try to glue all the parts into place, at least maybe she will at least be able to play with this toy with some usability. If this does not work, we are going to cut our losses and throw the thing in the trash."
1,More Display Than Play,"First, this mall has a lot of cute ideas but more for display value than play. The stores are too small to reach inside easily so you will upset the other items. Take for example the music store. We tried putting the cds on the stands, some stayed but not easily. If the store or stand is even tapped watch out. As for the escalator it can be a challenge to get the doll in the clip (at least the clip we received). Then when you turn on the escalator you need to pay attention to turn it off right away or it starts making a clicking noise - not sure how long it will last if someone really wants to play with it. Overall for the price I think there are a lot of better things out there!P.S. I am writing this for my child who is within the age range stated on the product"
2,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!,"You try to put the dolls in the stores, but, everything falls. In the music store,you pick up a C-D, the whole thing falls down. Dissiponiting,is'nt it? But there is more, you waste [money] for batterys. When I mess with one thing, it you can't get it becase the items are to small. I try to sit them on the chairs and the doll, and the chairs fall. And when you try to put up a sign, THE WHOLE THING FALLS DOWN!!! And the movie place you try to put the food on the shelves, when it falls, you try to get the food back, way in the coners witch are hard to get back. Next to that, I wish they made the stores BIGGER. Also, the signs in the movies witch you have to jam to get them in there and if you don't be careful, it will crash. And to rebuild will take hours. And where it shows one building stacked DO NOT DO THAT!!! Escalator does not work good. I am eight, and I do not realy like this toy.BAD FOR THE MONEY YOU SPENT, AND BAD FOR CHRISTAMS."
1,Total waste of money!!!!,"as all the others have said, this is a piece of junk!! Will not stay together and has been in the box since christmas. I will never buy Bratz merchandise again."
1,THE DESERTED MALL,"I bought this for my 4 1/2 and 6 year olds for xmas. They never play with it. It is a frustrating toy to try to play with. When you touch one thing something else falls apart. It is very hard for me, a thirty something, to keep it together. They do love to play with the dolls. It is just ashame that this expensive toy turned out to be such a hunk of junk."
1,very disappointed,"I was very disappointed when I received this ""natural"" product. It was filled with artificial sweetners! which were not advertised as a component before I ordered it. Thankfully though I was able to get a full refund"
3,Decent camera,"I got this camera because I had a stack of old 8mm tapes I wanted to convert to DVD. This little camera did the trick very easily. However, I would note, that if you have old tapes that were recorded in LP this will NOT play them."
5,Vater wood beater,"Huge improvement over the original DW beater, faster response and better sound. You will need to use a good heavy Kevlar pad on the head as this beater will quickly rub through a standard Mylar pad. I love the way my kick sounds and feels now."
4,Katt is back at it,"I saw the sneak preview for this back in July when they were tryin to get some feedback before they put it out in theatres as ""Pimp Chronicles 2"". We told them then that they should cut out the road trip all together and just focus on the stand-up, but I see that they didn't listen to our advice. I think the interruptions of the road trip take away from how funny Katt truly is in this.In my opinion Katt stepped his comedy up from Pimp Chronicles Pt. 1 to this, although that might be hard to believe.I give it 5 stars for the comedy, but the story and slow intro to the main event takes away from it slightly (although I loved Jeremy Pivens part), so thats why i have to give it only 4 stars.But anyone that love Pimp Chronicles, will definately love this one also. Katt is at his best. I Couldn't stop laughing, even after I got home. So Cop it!!!!"
2,what happened to kid rock?,"Where did kid rock go? What happened to the Devil Without a Cause??? Where are the songs like BullGod and Cowboy??? Long gone I guess. I'm not saying this isn't a good album. It is if you like country music and slow songs. This just doesn't do it for me. Did the American bad ass lose his badness??? Lets just hope he finds it in the next album. If you see the old kid rock, please tell him to come back."
1,"Not like the other albums, didn't like it much","This CD is NOT a regular Kid Rock release. It's a bunch of ballads and southern rock. He seems to have gotten alittle to full of himself with Picture. Maybe Pam has him whipped to a cream puff?I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone looking for more of his usual rock/rap blend. This is totaly differnt and I personally did not enjoy the sound.If you want more Picture and a passable cover for the Bad Company song ""Feel like making love"", buy this. Otherwise I would avoid it."
4,Versatility,"No, this new CD is not a rap-only CD. There are some ""rap"" tracks mixed in with rock & country/blues tracks. I love it. This CD directly caters to Kid Rock's demographic- fans of rap, country, rock, and blues. If your CD collection is like mine, peppered with Norah Jones, NWA, Pearl Jam, AC/DC, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Hank, Jimmy Buffett, Ludacris, Blink 182, Outkast, etc., then you will really like this self titled Kid Rock CD. This CD incorporates all of those genres and does it very well and It's the first CD I've PAID for in a very, very long time (wink, wink). Buy it."
3,"What happend to Classic ""Rock""","Well, I'm not impressed. Maybe because I was spoiled into his older albums, and yes ""Early Morning Stoned Pimp"" is his best album. I really did like where he was going with ""Devil Without A Cause"" and he was going back to the style he had in ""The Polyfuse Method"". I dug it alot. Then ""Cocky"" came out and I didn't like where his style was going, then ""Kid Rock"" which is worse in my eyes. But if you like hillbilly rock and twang, I guess you may like this one. If you were into his hip-hop days or hard rock days, they are long past my friend, and wouldn't suggest this album."
2,Too f***** slow,"I listened to the new CD and almost fell asleep listening to all the slow songs. What is he thinking? Yes he might be digging deep into his roots and yes he might be trying to break free of the hip-hop rap metal genre, but my God let your fans know that your new album will be slower than the Christina album my wife bought. Maybe Kid Rock will return to his senses when he realizes no one wants to listen to this slow crap in concert, and he can't sell out every city like in the past."
1,WHY IS THIS HACK STILL AROUND,"PLAY THE BEATLESPLAY THE DEAD KENNEDYSPLAY CAPTAIN BEEFHEARTPLAY FRANK ZAPPAPLAY AC/DCBut don't play this lame guy.........What a joke. can't this guy decide if he,s white or black. what a joke. HA. THINK ABOUT IT what is this joker trying to be."
1,Where's the Kid Rock i used to know?,"Honestly i loved ""Devil Without A Cause"" and ""History of Rock"" as they both have songs that rock the house with Rock and Rhyme.But this Album is not nearly as good as those.The only track i kinda liked was #7 and that's cause he rapped on it.He dont even attempt to rap on this album like he used to.I hate country and he's more doing that so i didnt buy this one."
2,Snore....,"After reading Rolling Stone magazines glowing review of this album I ran out and bought it. I was very dissapointed. Quotes like hard rock album of the year, 4/5 stars, etc have no business relating to this album. It is so so slow! Only 2 or so songs really rock. Be wary."
4,THE KID ROCKS,"Ok on this CD KID ROCK sings some more mellowed out songs but hey who cares its an awesome CD there are plenty of great songs on it like ROCK'N ROLL PAIN TRAIN, FEEL LIKE MAKING LOVE, SON OF DETRIOT AND MANY OTHERS this is more of a sit back and relax cd unlike his other 3 albums this cd proves he can rock the country music to !!ROCK ON"
3,Sold Out??,"Kidrock has gone country.Dont get me wrong I like country and I like this cd but not for Kidrock I like the cd cuz of the country, but I dont think I got a new Kidrock cd.as far as Im concerend This is Just a new country cd to add to my collection. The reason why I even liked Kidrock cuz it was totally different from anything I heard before.I think Kidrock sold out.....I hate to say it but a preformance like this from him is pretty disapointing.I think that he will lose alotta fans that he used to have but I also think he will gain more of a different crowd rather then younger people.But this album will never amount upto his previous work.thank god I didnt buy this cd!!"
2,No Longer a Rapper,What the heck happened on this CD?? Kid Rock is a multi-talented artist who made it big with his rap skills however this CD is basically a country/southern rock combination. He should have made WAY more rap tracks and sprinkled in a few country/southern rock tunes....instead its the other way around. Kid...dont forget what got you to this point. Go back to being the American Bad Ass!!
3,Sold Out,I was soo excited for the New Kidrock cd and when I heard it I was disapointed.This isnt Kidrock...its country!!I dont believe this.I got myself a country cd thinking it was Kidrock Rapping.HAHAHA this cd is a joke.Anyone need a new country cd? Ill see it cheap!!
1,"Introducing ""Kid Mellow""","The Kid's gone soft. I find it interesting that for his Super Bowl performance he chose to sing the tracks that made him rather than this [stuff]. He needs to make up his mind. Which is it kid? Rock or Country? The first I'll buy, the later you'll be forgotten.Update: don't take my word for it, look at the billboard charts. After 15 weeks on the chart he's fallen to #81. The highest this cd hit was #8 and that was probably driven by people hoping he'd gone back to being Kid Rock. Sadly instead he has continued his slide."
5,Its a scale,"Its a scale. What can I say. It works. I bought it about 2 years ago and it still works. Gives measurement in metric too, which is great. So for those of you who are sick an tired of archaic measurement units this is good."
2,Poor Construction,"I purchased two of these units along with one TF-S10 subwoofer from the same manufacturer. Less than 3 months after installing the products the paint is already chipping off on the TFS-50. Note that the TFS-50 and TFS-10 appear to use the exact same paint. It has only rained one time and there are no sprinklers anywhere near the unit, so the paint is basically falling off without any provocation. When I inspected the unit after noticing the paint chips I tipped it slightly and a large amount of water came pouring out. Apparently it is not only not sealed against water intrusion but it also allows it to collect inside. Given the small amount of rain we get here it is surprising that any was able to collect at all. I attempted to return the unit for repair or replacement but the manufacturer insisted that I pay for the packaging and shipping. Given the size and weight of this object it is not worth my time to do this. I recommend avoiding this manufacturer entirely."
4,A decent compilation,"It is an alright album, there aren't really any tracks that stand out besides Dream Photography."
2,"Looks Pretty, But DOES NOT WORK","I am in full agreement with the previous reviewer, this unit needs a seperate power source. I plugged in USB connections to all of the ports and one iSight Webcam to the firewire and this unit just failed. Connections are spotty at best and my external hard drives will not be recognized at all.It was a too good to be true price, and in the end, a pretty much useless piece of hardware."
3,Reliable...for the most part,"First bought this when I got my iMac. It has been okay, but I like my self powering USB port much better. On the reliability scale between 1-5, it is about a 4. I do like that it has firewire, but if I had to do it over again, I'd purchase a separate firewire port."
2,Not reliable,"I love the form factor -- it looks great sitting under the Mini -- but in practice it has been mostly just a source of frustration. I have a chain of self-powered Firewire hard drives which simply would not come up when plugged into this hub, but mounted just fine when plugged directly into the Mini. In addition, it does create quite a mess of cables behind the Mini, exposing only one port of each type on front where you really want them. This is a purchase I regret.In fairness, the USB portion of the hub does seem to work a bit better. So if you only need a USB hub, this might be OK, but I wouldn't recommend it for Firewire."
4,Good but not great,"The design is nice, and fits perfectly under my Mac Mini. I could possibly use more ports on the front or even better on the right or left sides instead of the back. It's a little difficult unplugging or plugging anything in when you're trying to reach your fingers in between the cords for the mac mini."
2,eeeeeeeeeeeee,"The first one I ordered was busted; something rattling around inside. I can't assume that's Belkin's fault, though, and I got my replacement really quickly. Anyway, after getting the new, intact hub, I hook it up to my laptop and all I can hear is this annoying high-pitched whine from whatever is going on inside this thing. After about a minute of that, I unplugged it and sent it back to Amazon. It was whining at a pitch and volume that I could not ignore, much less get any work done."
3,Not Bad,"This product is not self powered and draws power from the computer. It would have been better if it had it's own power supply. Also the USB and Firewire ports should have been divided equally. Otherwise, not a bad product."
1,This device not supported by Apple.,6-Port Combo Hub for Mac Mini6-Port Combo Hub for Mac Mini6-Port Combo Hub for Mac MiniThe Belkin 6 Port Combo Hub is not supported by Apple. It does not function as Belkin claims; Belkin's tech support is useless and there is no information available from Belkin to explain what a customer needs to do to make this device work - it absolutely is NOT plug and play.
3,Not happy with Samsung tv's,I bought this tv April 2008 it came with a free dvd player. I didnt start using it until Oct 2008. The audio was poor and I had to do the firmware upgrade that seemed to fix the problem. Recently I did a firmware upgrade on the free dvd player which then didnt work afterwards even though the player confirmed the upgrade was successful. Also the tv remote burned out after six months of use. Samsung graciously repaired the dvd player and replaced the remote. In 2007 I tried buying the Samsung slimfit crt tv. I had to return three tv's due to audio problems (I bought the Sony wega crt tv) . It appears Samsung consistently has audio problems with their tv's. I would be quite unhappy if I had paid more than I did for this Samsung tv. I'm sure I won't be purchasing a Samsung tv in the future.
4,Very good overall,"The picture is very good. Response time is very slow when changing channels, ect... Speakers are so-so and the PIP is too limited. The shipping did not work out well, that is the biggest complaint. The carrier would only give me a window of 1PM to 5PM. I said fine I will be home at four. NO, that won't work, we may show up any time from 1 to 5. How about Saturday? NO, we don't deliver on Saturday. I ended up driving 60 miles each way just to pick up my TV."
1,problems less than 3 years old,"I've had this tv for less than 3 years. first there was a green bar that went down the center. then a couple weeks later, when you turn the tv on, it turns on and off repeatedly for a couple minutes before it finally turns on. I've read online that Samsung used some cheap part and they are aware of this problem. of course this tv is no longer under warranty so now, we have to figure out how to fix it or just live with it. I had done research on this tv before purchasing it. at the time, all the reviews were good. so i'm very disappointed in this tv and will not buy another Samsung again! Very sad to say since I'm Korean and I like to support Korean products along w/ U.S. made ones."
3,Picture quality is low,"Hi, so I am new to this so please forgive my ignorance. I saw the TV at Sears and it had a very crisp quality. Did some research and found it here for much cheaper. Yesterday I received it, set it up and was disappointed when I turned it on.... so I thought, maybe a DVD will look better than regular cable (no HD) and it does look better but not nearly as crisp as the store model. Any suggestions? thanks in advance. -also, I have Comcast cable. I don't know if that makes a difference."
5,Samsung Warranty,I was reading reviews and wanted to say Samsung's warranty service is excellent. I bought the LN-s409D in 3/06 and the tv was a 2005 model. in 3/07 the last day the warranty was valid. the HDMI cable stopped working and the board was on back order. so rather than making me wait or giving me a refurbished unit they are giving me this TV as a replacement. (can't wait to get it) This tv is soooo much better than the one they are replacing.
1,Get rich with no money down!!,"Add this to the list of books that explain how you can get rich in a fantasy world. Look folks, if it was easy everyone would be doing it. You'll get rich faster by putting the money you would spend on this book into a saving account."
4,A different perspective,This is the first book about investments and money I have been able to read and follow quite easily. I am a real estate agent and a local mortgage lender gave a presentation about this book and his methods for investing money. I was very interested after listening to her presentation. I read all the Amazon reviews before making my purchase and am still glad I made the purchase.
5,Not for Financial Jelly Fish,"This book is not for weak kneed. It will challenge conventional thinking and make the reader stretch mentally. The concepts are sound and time tested, so they are reliable. I have heard Mr. Andrew speak on several different occasions and have always been informed and impressed by his depth of knowledge, insight and creativity. The key to the man and his book is toward the end when he begins to talk about multi-generational outlooks.This book has potential to bring dramatic changes to the way we prepare for our future and how we utilize wealth building principles."
5,Substancial and bright,"With both lights on in each lamp the room is as bright as midday.One light on in a lamp is bright enough to read by.Would buy again, when time for new ones I'll look for these again."
3,it is ok,the one good thing about this set is the horse (Arod) the Legolasis not that good . at a diferent site i saw a new one is is a palanor fialds Legolasps i am not 12 i am 14 and nead to know whare to get an Esterlingaction figur if u know whare i can get one on line im me or e-mail me miklax miklax@aol.com
2,Brilliant,One of those cant put it down books! I absolutely loved it but goes to show 'who can one trust'?
1,Ultimate Iceman,"I bought outer UFC DVD's and they were very intertaining. I thouhgt I was going to see Chuck Liddells greatest fights. No,it was all talk an BS!"
4,Great documentary,"This is a great documentary about Chuck Liddel. Talks about Chuck's childhood and emulation as a fighter from his first fight in the UFC where he was the guy ""with an accounting degree"" to the Light heavy-weight champion. The great thing about the DVD is that it deals with how Chuck deals with losses to a Legend such as Randy Couture and how he over came them, and it is refreshing to see how much respect the fighter have for each other as well with the exception if Tito Ortiz. I think Jason Horn put it best when he said ""I did not beat the Chuck Liddell of today I beat the fighter he was 6 years ago"". The only problem with this DVD is that it does not give you any bonus material at all, and just the highlights of the fights them selves. It would be nice the have a couple off the fights in there entirety. I mean you can fit more then an hour documentary on a DVD. In closing I would just like to say if you are a fan of Chuck Liddell or Randy Couture get this DVD."
4,A Nice Discovery,"On May 29, 2001, I had the chance to see THE legend Lucinda Williams in concert. Lucinda's opening act, Kasey Chambers, was an artist I had never heard of, but I am always open to hearing new music. I was very surprised with Kasey, and her performance. I immediately went to the theatre lobby and bought her CD. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the purchase. My favorite track would have to be ""We're All Gonna Die Someday."" I'm looking forward to her next release, as well. I highly reccomend this CD to anyone looking for some good COUNTRY music, rather than the ""flavor of the month country music"" heard on today's country radio. Forget Faith Hill, get Kasey Chambers, instead."
5,"Men, Beware!","Ladies, show your partner how best to use this. If used alone, you might not need that person at allIt's probably too big for some. After 3 kids it just the right size Goldilocks."
4,Good book,Happy I purchased this book. I like to add books to my library of health books for treating my family. This book is helpful in my beginning research of macrobiotics as my husbands diet lifestyle is changing for life due to health problems. I am glad I found this book. Ty
1,Bubbled and peeled on second use!,"I bought two of these pans not even a month ago. I have used them twice! Tonight I left them in the sink soaking and went back later to wash them. One of them had a combination of small and huge bubbles under the coating. When I washed it, the coating above each bubble peeled off! Now the pan is virtually useless. I'm calling Wilton when they open on Monday. TOTAL waste of money! I am SO disappointed in Wilton. I will update this review with Wilton's response."
1,Straw man for children,"I have no problem with children's books that deal with controversial subjects, and I certainly have no problem with children's books that are opinionated.On the other hand, Steig is intellectually dishonest in this presentation of a 'straw man' version of evolution. It's suitable only as propaganda for creationist parents too lazy to discuss the issue in an honest and thoughtful way."
1,disappointing,I am a retired Spanish teacher and am teaching a class on Spanish culture and civilization. I purchased this DVD thinking to use it as an introduction to my class but was very disappointed in both the quality and material. It was more like a quick travel video (28 minutes) and did little to present an introduction to the country.
2,What the heck?Is this it?,"So i ordered this for my dads birthday and he really likes sushi. I was excited when i found this on amazon it said it came with a book,rolling mat, etc. Well i got it a few days ago and all i got was the book i was hoping for the other parts but they haven't come. i ordered it with standard shipping but i think it was supposed to come together. anyway ill talk about the book. its really short and i say doesn't have the normal recipes only a few. I would have liked to know what i was supposed to get before i bought this and what was in it"
3,Decent,"The mic has a hard time picking up the natural volume fluctuations of a normal speaking voice. Not bad, all in all."
5,"It's a DRAMA cd, not a soundtrack.","This is a DRAMA CD, not a sountrack CD.That's the most important thing you should know about this CD. If you're expecting the magical sounds of Yoko Kanno and Hajime Mizoguchi's brilliant music, it's there, but in the background over the actors speaking.If you don't speak Japanese, you probably won't enjoy it, as it would be like watching a subtitled anime with no picture (and therefore no subtitles).The voice acting is done well, and it does a great job of capturing the feel of Escaflowne without any visuals. Definitely recommended to the fans who speak Japanese, but it's certainly not for everyone."
4,Wargs we're under attack !!,"I just got sharku today at a nearby [local] store. This toy has amazing detail so does the Warg. the one thing not so great about Sharku is that he doesn't sit on his warg right,but everything else on the toy is great Toybiz really out did themselves on this toy.Onething I wish Toybiz would do would be to make a new Orc to put on a Warg."
5,"UH! Orcs: Can't live with 'em, boring without 'em","The title pretty much says it all; no fun without orcs, I mean the good dudes can't kill each other! Plus, Sharku's the one figure on which I actually like the killing action thingy. I reccomend it! lol!"
3,An alright show unless you're expecting classic slapstick from the '60's,"When I heard Cartoon Network was making new episodes of the Looney Tunes, I was a little skeptical. I knew we wouldn't have Elmer Fudd pointing a gun in anyone's face. I also doubted we would have any of the dynamite or falling anvils that were prevalent in the 90's with Animaniacs or Tiny Toons. However, I certainly wasn't expecting the sitcom format they came up with. I also wasn't expecting a 22 minute episode with the same storyline (really would have preferred 5-15 minute shorts that are prevalent on Cartoon Network with Adventure Time and Regular Show Adult Swim).Personally, I would have rated the show 1 star, 2 at very best. However, as I read the other reviews, I realize that I'm probably not the target audience, having grown up on the classics; that's why I went middle of the road with 3 stars. If you go into the show with no prior knowledge, you might be able to enjoy it, but I just can't."
2,Not As Good As Original,"I have tried to watch this version of Looney Tunes, but it will never be as awesome as the Mel Blanc versions. The cartoon is crystal clear and beautiful - colors are vibrant in the animation, the actors do a pretty good job with the characters, but the stories are not as witty as the originals. The essence of these characters just seem to be missing from this new modern version. I am hopeful WB will distribute more of the originals in DVD format for the public."
4,Excellent basic intro to this extraordinary sport,"Some of us need an excuse - or at least an objective - in order to go out and face nature in its real, raw form. One of the purest forms of these endeavours is surf fishing. What the author describes here is a sport that can put you on a cold, wild beach in October, face to a raging surf, going manu a manu with a fish that may be as strong as you are. Recreating the ancestral challenges we all once faced to put food on the table doesn't get any more real than this.But there is no romance or deep reflection about the nature of things or why fly-fishing is like life in this book. It's nuts and bolts. And its about real surf fishing - not dropping a line while your at the beach. And its filled with the kind of information that - if you are really going to do it - you are really going to need.And remember - deflate those tires or they may never find you."
4,Silent and Effective,"I use one of these in my bedroom at home and I have another at the office. These air cleaners remove a surprising amount of crud from the air and they go about the job silently, until it's time for a cleaning, which is about once a week during the pollen season, and once every two weeks otherwise. My allergies have improved and I sleep more comfortably as a result. In the past, I used a noisy HEPA unit that required filter changes and did not work nearly as well as the Ionic Breeze. This item is somewhat pricey, but it's worth it to breathe comfortably."
1,JUNK,"I'LL BE QUICK. BOUGHT MINE ABOUT A YEAR AGO. PLACED IT ON THE CARPETED BEDROOM FLOOR. WORKED GREAT FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS, THEN DURING A RATHER LOW HUMIDITY PERIOD, I WENT TO TURN IT ON AND AS I TOUCHED THE CONTROL DIAL THERE WAS AN ELECTROSTATIC POP. APPARENTLY IT FRIED WHATEVER SENSITIVE CIRCUITRY THE DIAL WAS CONNECTED TO. HASN'T WORKED SINCE. HAS REMAINED IN THE CORNER FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN IT'S HARD TO THROW THE $4OO P.O.S. AWAY."
5,Better Than Expected,"I'll admit it. I wasn't expecting alot from this cd. I love Onelinedrawing, as should all of you, and I bought this cd souly for that song. I'm happy I listened to it all. Maybe it was because my heart was recently broken, but I found practiaclly every song on this album to be great. I love the Julina Theory, Diskothio, Gameface, and Onelinedrawing tracks alot. Anyone with a broken heart should pick this up, along with anyone who broke someones heart, and everyone else inbetween."
3,Interesting....,"I bought this film not knowing what to expect. It wasn't too expensive at the time and I love vampire filmsThe film synopsis is so complex I'm not even going to bother trying to explain it. I'm still left a bit confused by the ending and what actually happened in the movie. Yet I gave it three stars due to the effort made within this film. The nosferatu character was fun to watch. The girls were gorgeous. The comedy was there and was pretty good. Camera quality wasn't too bad although you felt as though the cameraman had take the day off and left the new guy in chargeI just wish they had done more with the characters at their disposal. None of the vampire victims seemed to turn and they had a cast of nice looking women who delivered their dialogue well but seemed disappointed by the quality of the film they were inIt is worth a watch if you are a vampire fan like me, but don't go out of your way to see it - there are films like this on youtube"
1,Just Because I'm Paranoid Doesn't Mean I'm Not Being Followed,"Phyllis Schlafly wrote The Gravediggers as a companion to A Choice, Not An Echo in 1964. As a rabid anti-communist and right wing extremist, her books reflect the McCarthy era paranoia that morphed into Richard Nixon's anti-liberty presidency in 1968. Ms. Schlafly's book provides a glimpse into the dark and frightened recesses of the ultra-conservative religious right that gained acendency under Ronald Reagan. The twisted roots of 1984 style ideology are revealed in this chilling tome and help to explain the paranoia of the Religious Wrong."
1,confused,"may be the worst Guide book of all times. Incomplete, maps are often wrong, not laid out in good order.Versus books has done a lot better and I was surprised that it was such a shambles.Never winter nights 2 was done by Brady games and it was superb. The walk throughs and maps from other web sites are much better than this.."
5,One Touch Ultra 2 meter,Works as advertized. Competitive price even w shipping added. I purchaced this item as a backup for one already in use and it has operated identically. It was a good deal.
1,Non accurate,"I have used few other diabetic meters before and this one was the worst among all. I took my after meal readings one after the other and my readings were 97, 133 and 162. This is ridiculous. Doctors recommend this one because the company might be paying them extra money for doing so. Anyways, all that physicians care about is filling their own pockets. I am highly unsatisfied and will return it today."
3,Be Careful,It is not compatible with the NetCommander KVM. Just do a little research before you buy and you'll be fine.
2,HUGEEEE!!,"The watch is huge!! huge, huge, huge. Too big for for me. Almost 1.5 times of the Wenger Diver watch i have. I am returning it. The watch looks good, but the watch dial, strap everything is big."
3,"Combat Techniques of taiji, xingyi & bagua","As a practitioner of xingyichuan, I found the book a useful reference resource to add to my martial arts library."
4,Super Dictionary,"A wonderful book for meanings of many Biblical terms, places and concepts.A must have for any person interested in studying the Bible"
3,Not his best.,"I really like PJ O'Rourke but this book is only OK.It may be that the subject matter is closer to home or more serious than his other books.He comes across as too old physically to do what he needed to do for his profession. That would be to have been imbedded with troops in Iraq for 2003 and if possible in Afganistan for 2001 and 2002, he does neither. What he does do is wander around luxury hotels in Kuwait. When stateside he makes no unique observations. Many people in NY or Washington on 9/11 could have written the same essays.Ever since 9/11 I have been waiting to see his take, and there is little insight and zero inspiration."
4,Elegantly and tastefully done,"This album and its collection of historic compositions, is both elegantly and tastefully rendered and appointed.Virtually the entire album is executed in the finest of good taste - and is both well groomed and tailored. The word 'Grand' comes to mind.Rated four and a half to five stars.Ken Cybulska"
5,Very sleek-very cool,"I really like this lap desk. It's thin, so it fits nicely in my laptop bag. The flip out mouse pad was the main reason why I chose this item. I have a 17"" laptop, and not many lapdesks offer enough space for a mouse to be used. I use this on an additional tilted desk and the rubber feet (at all four corners on both top & bottom) keep it secure. I like it so much, I bought my mother one for Mother's Day."
3,Amusing Little Book,"This is an amusing little book, filled with large, cute drawings of bears doing all sorts of silly things to demonstrate the one-line thoughts found at the bottom of each page. I was hoping for more informative Buddhist thought - this is mostly illustrations with a little bit of Buddhism - but it's amusing. If you're looking for a little book of bear drawings with some Buddhism here and there, this is it. However, if you're actually looking for a little book of Buddhist thought (like I was) with some beautiful illustrations here and there, I recommend the one by Taro Gold."
1,Seller - C's Collectibles,"The concept is good, but my beef is with the current seller online (as of 10/31/2010) who is listing the product for $1,000.00 U.S.!!! What a joke. Another example of a price-gouging seller on Amazon that is becoming all to common: they equate few or 1 seller as value. I am noting never to buy from this seller, or any others that aren't serious with regard to the price they list. BTW, download all the roms and an emulator online, and save yourself the $1000 price list, if anything, in principal alone."
3,Best of Commodore?,"I bought this because I was a child of the 1980s and grew up in the dawn of computer gaming. I owned an Atari 800 as opposed to the C-64 but many of the era's games were cross platform. This plug and play had 2 games I wanted: Jumpman Junior and Summer Games. I must say that I enjoy both (But I think my Atari beat the C64 in sound and graphics) but was less than impressed with the rest of the games in the collection. One is a frisbee toss. That was a greatest hit? I think this does a disservice to the games of the era. I would have liked to have seen Miner 2049er, Archon, and the original Jumpman. I still feel I got my 20 bucks out of it."
2,Does not read miniSDHC,I couldn't find any info on whether this reader could or could not read miniSDHC. It can't. At least not the 4GB card I have which is brand new. Too bad for my treo.
4,"Nice kitchen scale, no batteries","Looks great on the counter, well built and very accurate. I would have given 5 stars but its just a tad harder to read than my digital when weighing in ounces or grams."
1,Mine was wildly inaccurate!,"I bought this on the basis of reviews, looks, and a great half-price deal. All seemed to be well for a while, until I had occasion to measure some liquids in a cup. When it took much more than 16 liquid ounces of water (remembering the old high-school physics reminder, ""a pint's a pound the world around""), I became suspicious. Some more semi-scientific inquiry (i.e, a couple of 500-gram bags of pasta from the store) made me realize that this scale consistently measures 25% light! No amount of adjustment and tweaking (I even tried ""stretching"" the coilspring by over-turning the adjuster) made things better. Sorry, but, aesthetics aside, scales need to do only one thing well, and that's to weight stuff accurately. 5% error is (somewhat) forgivable; 25% is a joke. Too bad I tossed the box, but I'm still going to look into a replacement or refund."
1,Hard To Believe,"Her prose is exquisite but the apologia for the most vial aspects ofChinese culture (foot binding, widow suicide) is hard to take. One almost thinks it was a trick to turn the reader against Chinese culture!"
1,JUNK!,"I did not rate this one because it is an almost wothless design. In particular the head slant makes it very hard to use, and the v gap is too narrow to get a bite on framing nails. I use these tools everyday trust me, I threw mine away! You're better off with the Shark Grip."
2,Some girl... some snoozing,"This, a tale of four 20-something women seeking love, held a lot of promise based on the cast, but never delivered. The dialogue was stiff and poorly delivered. The main players are : Claire (Marissa Ribisi)- the ""desperate to fall in love flake, April (Juliette Lewis)- the drunk who sleeps with every guy she meets, Neal- (Michael Rapaport) April's pathetic cuckolded ""boyfriend"", and Jason (Giovanni Ribisi)- Claire's pathetic nerd brother. All actors and actresses I normally enjoy, but in this case none managed to deliver a performance worthy of note. Definitely a film I would not recommend to anyone other than a diehard fan of one the principal players."
3,Disney needs to release seasons in order,I am a fan of Hannah Montana and was so excited when season 1 was released on DVD. I really wish Disney would release ALL of the seasons on DVD and not just 1 and 4. If they were smart they would keep people happy by releasing complete seasons of shows on DVD. They would make more money that way.
1,Why on Green Earth do you need this when you have MotP?,"Manual of the Planes being in 3.0 system is not outdated like many of the 2e books (I got one of those by accident and the rules are quite hard to implement into a 3e game, don't listen to people whining about how good they were), and it is easy to find. The planar abilities are easy to understand, and quite clever. Plus, they even have decent prestige classes. The only thing different is the Planar Touchstones, which from the judgements elsewhere, the 33 pages could be put in by 3.0 rules in 10 pages or less more effectively."
4,A Likable Actor's Likable Story,"This oddly titled autobiography is a decidedly good read. It is not, however, the book most Alan Alda fans (and I am one) would have hoped for. While always funny, there is a good deal of psycho-analysis of his own psyche and that of his parents which is interesting and engaging but it seems to come at the expense of insights into his many decades as a bonafide celebrity. He first came to my attention with the movie ""The Paper Lion"" but this, like much of his film and TV career, gets only cursory mention. The exception to this general rule is, of course, MASH. Even so, many readers will find even those passages a little light given the long run of the show. As much as anything, this is the story of how one becomes an actor and the stage craft that one absorbs over the years if raised in a theatrical environment with entertaining in your DNA. Fans will like the book and aspiring actors and actresses will probably be more devoted to it."
3,Rather disappointing,"I think that the Planescape setting is a great change of pace from the normal, 'knights and dragons' fantasy setting, a more mature, intellectual campaign world. But this set's not perfect. It's way too bogged down on rules (well, just about every D&D product is), too caught up in what spells work on what planes and crap like that. Combat and rules and eveything is great, but roleplaying is about telling a story. I wish they would emphasize more that if a rule gets in the way, chuck it out the window (like White Wolf games), but all the rules are way too strictly enforced. Another thing is the much-touted 'infinitum' of the planes, but they dont talk about this enough, either. The planes as portrayed in these books feel too limited, like there's only just the 16 Outer Planes discussed. I know only a finite amount of background material can be enclosed in any book, but it just isn't what's advertised."
4,Excellent Detail for Post-grads,"This book is a step beyond a basic molecular biology handbook. In addition to re-covering molecular basics, the author goes into more detail on how processes work. For example, instead of merely describing restriction enzymes, the author gives the background, naming convention, troubleshooting, and full applications of the enzymes. The information given is presented perfectly for a post graduate beginning their career in molecular biology.The diagrams and tables of the book are also very helpful and clearly drawn."
3,Needs more information to really be usefull.,"This book is a handy reference manual to have around. With over 400 pages of terms, the information is a surface type of format, only giving the basic amount necessary.From A to Z there are terms like ANSI, CDR, ELAN, ISDN, MUX, NAM, POTS, SMB, UDP and XID. Also there is a section strictly devoted to Cisco terms from CID, CNSI, EIRGP, FSIP, ISL, SDLC, TRIP and IRGP are but as few of the terms.There could be a whole lot more added to this book including pictures of some things, a cd rom with an e-version of the book. Overall the value may not be worth the price."
3,It isn't clear what cut this gives,I bought this blade but was not clear what coat it should be used on or what effect it would give. The description is not clear and I had a hard time finding any information. Finally I found something after I had ordered the blade only to find out it was for fluffy coated dogs such as poodle and the 3F blade would have been a better choice for a dropped hair dog. I wanted to achieve the puppy cut on Shih Tzu and this was not the right blade to use for that. I wish the product description was more clear or there was a link for information prior to ordering regarding the blade recommendations for breeds of dogs and the cut desired. I think other dog owners would look into buying their own grooming tools if they had proper information on what tools will be their best choice.
2,Junk,The Turtle Lair is not durable and should be taken off the market. Save yourself lots of time and money don't buy it! I'm taking it back to the store. Junk!
3,"Lots of fun, but kept falling apart","I bought this toy for my 5 year old and at first it was lots of fun for him. It wasn't hard to put together at all. It had lots of pieces, but the instructions were great. Anyway, after about 30 min. worth of playing with it, it fell apart. The little pegs that hinge the walls together would not stay in and they were so small that they were lost very easily. Without those tiny little pegs, it will not stay together. So, maybe the ""Turtle Lair"" was meant for older kids that would be easy with it, but kids are rough with their toys and this one just fell apart too easy. As for the fun level, well if your child has to be so careful while he/she is playing with it, then I don't think it is fun."
1,so disappointed...,"My 4 year old was really excited to recieve this lair for Christmas but was soon let down. The building constantly falls apart even to me it was difficult to play with the figures in it without knocking one of the walls over and then spending wasted time to try to put everything back together again just for the same thing to happen again. I think when it is all closed up it does make a nice storage box for the figures but not a very durable toy for even light play, I have china plates that are more sturdy than this toy. ...too bad he really was excited about it and we were both very disappointed."
2,Disappointed.....,"My son got this for his 5th birthday and I agree with all the others who had trouble putting it together. I am usually really good with putting these types of toys together/reading directions...however these directions WERE vague and didn't coincide w/ the toy at all! This toy snaps together in 3 main sections, however they don't stay snapped together. My little boy gets upset/frustrated every time it falls apart and I am tired of trying to fix it. Although it is supposed to fold up nice into a carrier/storage box, I wouldn't DARE touch it to do that for fear it will fall apart. As I type, it lays in a heap in the family room..."
2,Don't Buy it!,"I had read reviews before I bought this that this toy doesn't stay together, and boy were they right!! It was put together correctly and continually falls apart as my son plays with it, it does not fold up completely as it's supposed to, and it's big and awkward size with lots of little parts make it perfect for cluttering up your home. My son is very into the ninja turtle but plays with the lair very little because it keeps falling apart. This toy is a big disappointment! Don't buy it and save yourself a trip to the Salvation Army with it in a year to get it out of your hair!"
5,This book unlocks the woman within.,"What moved me most about this fine title is the reletive homliness of the women pictured. After all, women need not be beautiful to enjoy themselves and their bodies. In fact, this book can provide for the overweight or ""ugly-in-the-eye-of-men"" women I know with the method, insight and inspiration to experience true sensual pleasure. It would make a fine gift for any wife, daughter or mother seeking to not only increase their own sexual fufillment, but also expand their knowledge of their own anatomy -- something suppressed by our phallus-dominated society. If only I had this book when I was an unsure, lonely teen, I would not have lost so many years before my own erotic awakening.I encourage this book to be shared between women and made available in school libraries and health offices."
4,interesting details of the Cold War,"There are many things I liked about ""Victory."" I liked the overall theme that Reagan and the other Cold Warriors brought down the USSR through their efforts. This is refreshing to hear since left-wing revisionists give the credit to Gorbachev.I enjoyed hearing details of what the USA was doing in Poland and Afghanistan in the 1980's. Even though I had read quite a bit about both theaters, I was unaware of some of the interesting details that Mr. Schweizer has included. Also, I gained a better understanding of the basis for the friendship between the American government and the Saudi royal family.The only bits that I had trouble with were the calculations of how much the USSR lost and Saudi Arabia gained from the decrease in the value of the dollar in the mid-1980's. I think the author was bending mathematical logic.John Christmas, author of ""Democracy Society"""
5,AWSOME SOUND!!!,"This is probably the best concert and the best DVD SOUND you can get on this digital format, make looks the Gladiators sound dvd like an am radio receiver.If you're a trully fan of U2, you'll love this DVD, the concert director is Hamish Hamilton, who proves again he's the GENIUS OF LIVE EVENTS!!!"
5,It was a great show,"Buy this DVD! I was at the FleetCenter in Boston when this show was taped, and let me tell you, it was awesome! I don't know why 'One' is missing from the track list, since they recorded this show over two nights, and it was played on both nights, but what can you do? For the die-hard's reference, this was also the night when U2 performed Live to the NBA Finals right from the FleetCenter. Anyway, great show, and if you are a fan, buy the DVD."
5,Best way to relive a great experience,"I saw the show in New York's Madison Square Garden from behind the stage, in the uppermost section... I'm so happy that I actually made it to the concert and that it was such a great show that I didn't mind. This DVD blew me away; it even made me want to dance in my living room. Although a few ""key"" songs were missing, the set list is great and the band's connection with its fans is almost as heartfelt on screen as it is on stage."
5,awesome concert brought to your own home,"I personally went to U2 in Boston, i went to show #4, which to most people was the best. I couldn't wait to come home and watch this again, this time on my couch. you see so much more on the movie than you do when u are actually there. This is a must buy for U2 fans all around the world and a must be for anyone into music. they put on an awesome show and everyone should be able to see them."
5,"Good Humor, Great Fun",The Runaway Princess was very entertaining. I really loved the heroine though her ability to accomplish all sorts of untried skills (from bookish study) was a bit of a stretch. Some elements of the plot were predictable but there were some good surprises too. The humorous interaction was fun. The book was pure fantasy. It was great and I absolutely loved it!!
5,A Pure Pleasure,"I laughed all the way through THE RUNAWAY PRINCESS. Her hero is big, domineering, sexy as can be and won't take NO for an answer. But the heroine is more than a match for him -- she's resourceful, quick-witted and funny, making wry observations about men (even in the 19th century, men apparently wouldn't stop for the directions --or anything else.) Dodd creates a fantasy country and then peoples it with irresistable characters in this fun and romantic fairy tale. You can't help but enjoy it."
2,lacks luster,I thought this book would be a good read because of the reviews but to my dismay it was soooo boring. The plot was was okay but the characters were kinda dull. I had to finish the book to get my money's worth.
4,Great Read,"I really enjoyed this book. I've read all of Ms. Dodd's books and this is one of my favorites. The characters are funny and the plot was fast pace, I read this book in one day,and when I just need a book to take me away I read it again!"
3,Good but not Great,"I thought this book was good but wasn't great. The story was pretty solid but I found myself getting a little bored at times. The characters were ok but Ms. Dodd has written much better characters. It's worth the read, but not going to be a book you will remember after you read a few other romance novels."
3,Good for the price,"Reasonably priced, but I've had much better. I do like the size it comes in, but the chocolate is not as smooth as per se, those from Ecuador."
1,"Finally, a religion for idiots.","It is noteworthy that this book is irreverent toward Jesus Christ and Christians, makes a mockery of conspiracy theorists about masons and jews and has otherwise nothing to say beyond that. Note that it is not irreverent toward jews. And note the publisher is Simon and Shuster. He who laughs last laughs best. If I were uncharitable, I would enjoy a good laugh when these fools are in hell. After all, I highly doubt that they will find hell a laughing matter since they make a mockery of the free gift of salvation in Jesus Christ. I know they will be more unnerved by what I just said here than I will be of what they said in this stupid book."
3,Poor Image Resolution,"I won't comment on the content and subject matter of the book as many have already covered this. However for the Kindle version I am very disappointed with the image quality - when I zoom the images on my iPod, the resolution is nowhere near clear enough for the text in the scanned images to be legible! For example I cannot read any of the predictions 1983-1999.Good concept but they need to improve the scan quality for the Kindle version."
1,Here's what's wrong with America,"Ready? Here's some information that it is difficult to believe, but true:This book was solicited to bookstores before it's publication, which is very common. This book, however, was a special case. When it was sold to bookstores, it was not presented as a book about John Kerry-- no, the tentative title was something along the lines of ""Democratic Presidential nominee.""What does that mean? The author and the publisher decided they would do a very negative book about a flip-flopping, card-carrying liberal politician-- they just weren't sure of the outcome of a little formality called the Democratic primary, so they did not know who the book was going to be about. You know how Sports Illustrated or whoever runs a commercial right after the Super Bowl or the World Series with the team that just won? Similar case here, but they are pretending to be writing an honest book about John Kerry here. Once Kerry won, they gave it a title and sped out the book."
5,Help at last for anyone moving to a warm climate,"Anyone who has ever moved (or is thinking of moving) to a new country will find this book invaluable. Tracey gives much needed advice on survival and goes right to the nitty-gritty of everyday life. Especially fascinating for people interested in Bermuda, this guide is a must-read for anyone moving to a different culture and climate."
1,Not for multibutton mouse or extended keyboard. Slow Support,"I'm using two Windows 2000 machines with a Logitech MX700 USB mouse and Logitech Elite USB Keyboard. When I hooked up this switch I found that the mouse and keyboard don't work after swithing between systems.I emailed Hawking support and waited two days for an answer.Their reply was, ""please make sure to use 2-button standard mouse with no wheel and 101-key standard keyboard."" This is despite the fact that the product box says ""support (sic) most USB & PS/2 Mouse, USB & PS/2 Keyboard.""Unless you have a very simple mouse and keyboard, don't bother buying this product."
2,Royal FamilyJapanese Style Mochi,"Sorry, wanted to like it but just didn't. Have ordered other similar products and been happy with taste. This sampler pack just didn't work for me."
3,Good but not great,"The mochi are a different kind of treat, love the texture but did not like the sesame seeds and the nut dust some of the mochi had."
3,interesting product,"I bought these for my mom for mother's day since they are gluten free and she likes the red bean. She liked all of the flavors but didn't care for the marshmellowy texture of the cakes. They are rather gummy. She said she'd but them again, but not at the price I paid."
2,Not authentic Japanese product,"I bought this item, thinking it was from Japan but it turned out to be from Taiwan, which is extremely disappointing. In regard to the quality, this is in no way even close to those made in Japan. Most, if not all of the flavors included in the package taste the same. The fillings taste a little different but very artificial and fake. That said, it doesn't taste horrible, just like any cheap rice-based sugared cakes. This product is completely over-priced for a low-quality knock-off product. Vendor should disclose its origin and stop insinuating that it's an authentic Japanese product. Wouldn't by it again."
2,"Big Disappointment, Sloppy Writing","Ugh. What a disappointment. This book badly needed an editor -- any editor. It reads like a high school draft that was rushed together before deadline. Yates is terrific in the pages of Car and Driver, where he's got adult supervision, but this book is unfinished and unprofessional. He contradicts himself, misspells words -- including, ironically, 'editorial' -- invents new words, and defines the same term three times in as many chapters. There's one whole chapter where lowercase L's are used in place of the number 1.Apart from that, his peculiar ""faction"" or I-was-there style doesn't really suit the material, or his talents. He's still writing a history, he just inserts the words 'I' and 'me' from time to time to liven it up. It doesn't make the story compelling, just lame. Too bad."
2,Against Death and Time,"This could have been a GOOD book? There are many good parts to the book, but it wonders, isn't connective and supplies a complete chapter on a personal novel, not racing. It could also do without the author's escapades! To bad it couldn't have been more directed toward some of those Great Drives of the time. Many, including those pictured on the cover are left OUT!"
2,"If you want to read a research paper, read this....","I have read other pieces that covered motor racing in the 50's and 60's, and this book read as if it was a research paper. Although the author was detailed in his accounts, he would change subjects frequently and the separation of chapters seemed random. Knowing about some of the events he wrote about, Yates seemed to rush through the races only to repeat a point as if it was his thesis statement. He would state his points bluntly instead of letter the reader discover what he was trying to say through a vivid account of what had occurred."
4,Help is on the way,I found this book very helpful in solving problems assigned by my profesor for homework. Seeing the correct answer helped me to find the errors in my work.
3,"Nice, but...",I was ready to purchase until I saw they have a leather upper. I am looking for cruelty-free and eco-conscious stylish clogs.
2,Disappointed too!,"I started seriosly my study with this book.The good one is, the style he (the author)talk to us in the book, I really like it!But some thinks are logical and I understand easierly, but some others really difficult. And if your head is burning, and still you don't understand the meaning, your are demotivated. A little bit later, you find out that not you are mistaken,there are explanations in the book, the can 't be true! That are not translation-mistakes, like from english to german. I compared it with an original english book. And? The it 's the same! How can a Leaf-Object recieve ""C"" as an Object-Right. Check it under the capital:Netware-Security. Where you can make your own test! The other mistakes are softer, but enough to make you confus.I wouldn`'t explain everything here, if I could find out who is responsible, to give a chance to modify the book."
4,Seems helpful,"I have been suffering with hair loss due to my autoimmune disease and its treatments. My dermatologist suggested that I try this twice a day for three months, then daily for another three months. I think it has worked to some degree. I am still losing hair but it seems that the rate of loss has slowed down. One thing that seems to be happening is that it is growing longer at a quicker pace. I will see my dermatologist in a couple months to see what she has to say but unless she says I should cease taking it, I will add it as a long term compliment to my daily pills and supplements."
1,No!,"I was using it may be for 8 month or may be even longer. Pretty faithful, ah? ZERO result! NOTHING! Totally waisted money!"
3,Too early to tell,"Because Viviscal is for hair grouwth, it naturally takes a while to determine if it is working. My hair does seem to feel a little stronger. Don't know if it is my imagination.One thing I have noticed that my fingernails seem to be growing faster."
3,Questionable product,I've been taking Viviscal for 6 months with no noticeable effect. Will continue for the full year suggested but am very skeptical at this point
4,Great book!,"I got this for my son, who's now 14 months, when he was about 7 or 8 months old. He still loves playing with it. The pages are easy to turn and the different fabrics still fascinate him. We have this book and the Fuzzy Bee and Friends cloth book, which he still plays with, too!Fuzzy Bee and Friends (Cloth Books)"
2,Poorer quality than expected,"I recently purchased this book because my 6 month old loves the Fluffy Chick book, and I thought sea creatures would be fun! I especially liked the iridescent fabric pictured on the turtle on the cover of the book. When the book arrived, the turtle had a boring green polyester fabric on his shell, and the rest of the touchable fabrics were of a lesser quality and less fun than in the fluffy chick book. Additionally, the stitching work looked sloppy, so I sent the book back. On top of all of this, the book was mailed 3 weeks after the rest of my order. I suggest buying a used version and washing it."
5,Great book!,Terrific illustrations. Fun text. Nice variety of textures throughout this book. My granddaughter loves it already. I'm so glad I chose this one for a 7 month old.
1,Dissapointed with a different version of the book!,"The ""search inside this book"" feature shows that there are eight sea creatures in the book. However, the version I received has only six (see my uploaded customer image). The book has the same ISBN as the longer version. Feeling deceived!"
5,Attack - 'Magic In The Air' (Aftermath),"Great '60's psychedelic from this pre-Atomic Rooster band. Fourteen track compilation of the Attack's short-lived career and repertoire - nice cover and all ( is it just me or does this CD cover the Beatles' 'Yellow Submarine' lp?), but this CD is super-tough to find. Sure it has tunes like ""Mr. Pinnodmys Dilemma"", ""Try It"", ""Strange House"", ""Lady Orange Peel"" and ""Too Old"", but if I were you, I'd look for a copy of the more recent release 'About Time! Collection 1966-68' - for it has all these tunes plus five more. A nice find."
4,Loved the Sample on my Kindle but won't pay $15.99 when the paperback is $5.99,"I got a sample of The Shell Collector on my Kindle and got hooked on the first story. The writing is terrific. When I got to the end of the sample, before the end of the first story, I decided to buy the entire book. But when I went to Amazon to buy it I was astounded that the price was $15.99. According to Amazon, the price was set by the publisher. But given that the price for the paperback is $5.99 and this book was released in 2003, I just can't support $15.99. Mr Doerr is by all accounts a fabulous, imaginiative writer and his most recent book, Memory Wall, is available on the Kindle for $10.99 - though I can only access the Kindle edition via my Kindle and not via main Amazon - kind of odd. I do not believe in trashing a book based on the vagaries of Amazon/Kindle/Publisher price wars, but really this is nuts! It's silly to pay 3 times the price of the paperback. I love my Kindle but..."
5,IF YOU CANt GET ENOUGH OF JAMES BOND,"""Kiss Kiss Bang! Bang!: The Unofficial James Bond Film Companion"" by Alan Barnes and Marcus Hearn is a very good book on James Bond info. Even though unofficial it has good information. I like it."
5,Great Insight!,Watched this when it first came out in 2000. Loved it! Felt that it touched the truth and how things are and perceived. Great Insight for the mind. Made me look at dragon flies in a whole new light.
5,Spinning Book,"I have been doing research on spinning for two years or so, and this book has the answers to all the questions I have had during that time. Perhaps, it was better for me to find it at this stage, to recognize that it has the answers. Published in 1977, it covers -more than superficially but less than comprehensive- all of the aspects of history, spinning, wool, sheep, tools, spinning wheels, technique and methodology that a new spinner needs to know. I was impressed with the information and how classic it is to all the present day body of knowledge. This book shares without stint - or the author does - in one volume. I have read dozens of books and magazines, and I would state I learned as much in this book as all of those materials. The black and white photographs are dated and hard to see for details. I say to anyone who has an interest in spinning, find this book for your library, it is definitely a keeper."
2,Check Your System,"This USB 2.0 port might work fine, but, if your system does not have a PCI slot with revision 2.2, forget it. Unfortunately, I didn't check first. After installing the card and the supplied software, my system said the card was working fine, but no USB device was detected or recognized. I checked my system and found my PCI slots were actually revision 2.1. I installed a Belkin USB 2.0 dual-port PCI card instead, which is compatable with PCI revision 2.1, and everything worked fine."
5,Mailbox,"I thought this mailbox was smaller, but it appeared large out of the box. It looks great outside and is sturdy. This product appears to be well made also."
4,Turbotax Online Free Edition,"I like TurboTax and have used it for years. But as every year passes it becomes more and more bloated. And unlike Taxcut, Intuit has decided to drop support for Windows 98 (which millions of people still use).The good news is, if you only do simple returns that doesn't involve small businesses, investment property or farm income you can get TurboTax for FREE directly from Intuit online. Better yet, it also includes free federal e-filing. Just do a Google search for ""TurboTax Online Free Edition""."
4,Pretty Good for first time doing tax on your own,"The program was easy to use and pretty self explanatory. But, beware, I had a problem getting the updates because my firewall was on. I called Intuit for this problem because I didn't know why the updates weren't downloading and they helped me solve the problem, but with a $20 fee!! So, if you have questions, I advise to look for troubleshooting online first before calling Intuit."
5,Gripping historical novel,"""The Falcon of Palermo"" is a gripping historical novel.Its author, Maria R. Bordihn, introduced me to one of the most colourful and dazzling personalities in history: Frederic II of Hohenstaufen, King of Sicily and Germany, Roman Emperor and King of Jerusalem.I felt physically moved into the 13th century, where I took part in Frederic's life. I followed him in his search for the truth and came to admire him for his exceptional tolerance for other cultures and religions.Bordihn tells the story of his life, his struggle with the papacy and the crusades, his search for power, for freedom for his people and last, but not least, the story of his great passion for Bianca Lancia.Bordihn's historical facts are accurate. Her Frederic is vividly human and all the main characters she convincingly introduces really existed.This is a very well written book you will be unable to put down. You will solely regret the fact that there is no sequel to it."
5,A New Way to Paint,"The original was good, the revised edition better. But don't turn down the first if you see it in the second-hand store! This book transformed my painting. Though I used pastels or acrylics for twenty-five years, I have not touched them since. It is the perfect media for a small apartment (zero mess) and an irregular schedule (the media doesn't dry out before you can get back to work, and the colors stay the same). Especially valuable because the artist shows how the paintings develop in layers, and how she judges and corrects them to fit her evolving ideas."
3,"Good ... I needed more actual exercises, though.","I bought this book and 'Colored Pencil For The Serious Beginner' and I just didn't find them very helpful, though others certainly have. What I need is step-by-step exercises as I build my technique rather than examples and explainations and this book just didn't provide as many and at the depth I found elsewhere. The explainations were great, to be sure, but I have since found that things are explained much better (for me) in other publications. She has a particular style of work that is not so much photo-realistic as impressionist and maybe that is the reason it didn't suit me. I'm sure others will find it perfect for their style of learning."
2,Hawaiian Elevator Love Songs,"Hate to be harsh because there are alot of great songs. However, it sounds like they used a one man band for each song. It doesn't have vocals and is monotonous. It's a great buy if your an elevator operator brah!"
3,"Sort of good, sort of bad","I received the scale very quickly. It is easy to use and calibrate to ""0"" when you wish to measure food. The price is very competitive.The only disappointment was in NOT receiving the ""Clear Bowl"" as ordered and specified in the details of the product description. I received a white opaque bowl that I did NOT want. I would have exchanged it except for the hassle involved in exchanging it."
3,It's not a COOKBOOK w/scrapbooking materials,"It may be just me, but I thought this was an actual cookbook that came w/scapbooking materials for my family recipes. I re-read Amazon's description after I'd received the book, and still I find their description not clear. This is strictly a ""how to"" of scrapbooking your recipes - no cookbook or scrapbooking materials included. BUT I rated this book based on it's purpose. If you're already into scrapbooking, you're probably able to come up w/your own ideas w/out the help of this book - there isn't anything spectacular."
5,ACE,Speedy delivery as always. DVD was delivered in perfect condition and is being well enjoyed. Hope to do more business with you in the near future.
5,No camera should be without one.,I am so very glad I spent the extra cash and bought this filter. It'a more than paid for it's self on my weekend trip to Yosemite National Park. I was at the base of Bridelvale Falls trying to take a picture of half sky and half falls that I could not get the proper exposure. Enter the Hoya 58mm Half Neutral Density 4X glass filter. The darkened glass filtered just enough bright sky out to create a great photo of the water cascading over the lip of the falls. Can't wait to use this on a sunset over the ocean.
1,big disappointment,"Looked so different in picture,it is the size of hand towel. Went out to yard sale next day."
4,"Sweet Dreams, Speed Dreams","My [...] year old son loves the Nascar Jeff Gordon Bed Tent he got for Christmas. It is easy to assemble, even my son can do it. He can also keep his bed made with the tent on it. It is made of very light weight fabric, so it is not intended for rough play. It is not going to keep anyone from rolling out of bed because the sides do not attatch to the bed. One side has two flaps that can tie back for an easy tuck-in."
5,About #4...,"If you already have 3 of the volume from wherever shop. You would better listen to the final one, volume #4. I don't think there is easier way to get the volume than to go to Amazon Japan Site. If you have ever experienced Japanese web site, you would know that it could never be easy to shop for the people who do not read Japanese. Of course, there is a language selection option for english speaking customer; you'd better not to be so intimidated for shopping at the site. As Jmichael wrote, to track down volume # 4 is well worth the nuisance. Good luck!"
4,"Can't beat Bach, but that was not the aim",All started from the motion picture La vie promisse. You'd better see it. And then I was not able to get off the Lewis variation on Prelude 13.Nothing on the disk is better than that. But all the music on the disk is immensly charming.
2,Terrible Book,"First of all the binding of the 3rd edition is horrible, and I barely used it. My class used this book for analysis 2, basically just using the second half of the book. The notation is horrible, there is almost no expository writing between the proofs and theorems. Often proofs are longer than they need to be, but others are extremely terse and skip key pieces of logic. For analysis 1 I loved Ross's Book ""Elementary analysis: the theory of calculus"", and I think analysis 2 would have been better off transitioning to Rudin as opposed to this book."
3,it's quick,"I received it far more quick than I expected.However, because it's a soft cover, so the edge has damaged in the transportation"
3,Talk about an angry book!,"WOW...this book is so in-depth, but I felt so angry as I was reading it. It was very frustrating for me as a reader because both parties were so ugly to each other. The kids suffered so much."
1,Junk!!,"My old Non-Stick Grilling Baskets wore out (coating gone, rusty). Found these and ordered them as they were the same thing, different manufacturer. There is NOTHING Non-Stick about these! Spray them, spray the food, it STILL sticks!! Awful! Will buy local next time so if stuff sticks I can take them back and whack the shop owner upside the head with them! Color me disgusted!"
4,Could Have Been Better,"This CD is advertised as containing the ""original"" version of Waterloo in addition to the German version. Not true: it contains the English version of Waterloo (the original was in Swedish, which would have been a nice addition since the English version is widely available). It would also have been nice to include the French version, but it's not here. The medley is unique to this disc as far as I know so overall it's okay for the price, but it would have been better if it had all four versions of Waterloo (or at least the three non-English versions)."
4,Good Pads,"Nice pads for the price. Not sure about their longevity yet, as i put them on as replacements on a mountain bike, then broke my derauluer and bought a new bike altogether. Easy to install, standard bike Allen wrench to put them on, installed in less than 10 minutes."
1,THE DVD,"It was in german and wouldn't play on my DVD player. The ads title was 'The Quiet Man', NOT der sieger!"
5,A Great Classic Movie,"Restored well, good quality and sound. I was glad I waited for the 60th Anniversary restored edition. A classic ""St. Patrick's Day"" movie."
5,Olive Films The Quiet Man (60th Anniversary Special Edition),"Finally we have a proper transfer of what may be Ford's greatest film. Sharp images and proper color, apparently from a new scan. A great job by Olive Films; this is the version to get."
3,Odd,This odd little book probably would be better enjoyed by someone familiar with Ms. Grimes stories and writing style. I thought it was interesting but I sensed that there is more to it than I was gleaning.
2,Rather disappointing,"I am sure B. Frantzis is a very knowledgeable man, but this book is a little too diluted! The same thing could have been written in less than half the book. So many pages on what you should not do could have been replaced by clear explanations focusing on what you should do. Although I enjoyed reading about the experiences of the author in Asia, I had the impression that he is trying to fill as many pages as possible while teaching a minimum. For beginning or advanced qigong I would recommend the books by Lam Kam Chuen. They are so clear and beautiful, and one can learn a lot without a teacher. Check The Way of Power, book and video, for advanced qigong."
2,Book with water damage.,"The book has water damage. The condition of this book should have been stated as ""poor."""
2,these are not pure..,This product is advertised as buckwheat noodles however it is mostly wheat flour. Real buckwheat noodles are %100 buckwheat. However the packaging is nice and I like it is organic.
3,Chem student opinion,This is a good book but very complicated. It is hard to follow the text because diagrams are often refered to that do not appear until later. It provides a great deal of information but is difficult to take notes on. Would not recommend for everyone.It is best for those with prior chemistry knowledge. Should have whole book on cd but does provide an overview cd which is somewhat useful.
2,ehh.,"altogether, this was a difficult book to understand. it's worded for some one who already has more than two years of chemistry. (not for Chem II in HS.) the CD that it comes with does not work at all."
3,Threat Level Black,"Terse, and fast paced but the ending came to a very fast stop....the ending could have been better developed to give the reader a better sense of finality."
2,boring,"I thought the concept of a blackout from an EMP would be fascinating. As much as I enjoyed the lead character from the FBI who had depth and a few rough edges, the rest were flat and uninteresting. I found the book to be long and boring to the point I finally quit half way though, a rarity for me."
2,NoDaleBrown,Very vague plot. Never really tied the threats togather. Lead character without any real fire. Would be reluctant to buy the author again.
4,You are not alone.,"If you'd rather wear sweatpants than pantyhose, stay home with your dogs on New Year's Eve than find a date, then read this book. Now.Using her trademarked humor, wit and sarcasm, Heimel can help you find a new place to live or sniff out the perfect spouse without sucumbing to embarrassing fads like wearing Doc Marten's with flowered dresses."
1,Don't buy this book if you're not a feminist.,"If you are a conservative and not a feminist, this book is sure to irritate you. She whines and nags about herself and her life and it made me hope I never have or ever do sound like such a miserable wretch."
1,What a piece of crap,"If you understand the difference between ""dubious"" and ""skeptical"" or ""wretch"" and ""retch"", this writer will infuriate you. I managed to get all the way to about page 40 before I tossed it. What a waste of 2 bucks and an hour of my time. Avon should invest in an editor when they publish books from this guy. The reason I bought the book is it had a positive sounding quote from the Times of London on the cover, but I can't imagine how anyone could give it a positive review. Must have been one of those taken out of context/actual quote had the oppposite meaning things. AVOID"
3,"Not another Brother Cadfael, which I was hoping for.","There's a good story here, but it need an editor's touch to bring it out. The author has a poor command of dialogue and tends to be repetitious. I'd like to think that as he writes more he will improve, but for now he's no Ellis Peters or Patrick O'brian."
2,Really not all that terribly good,"The Hellraiser series of movies have been uneven, although I think 2 was the best. These stories don't have much to do with the mythology of the movies, instead re-creating the horror without the depth.I used to read the series of graphics occassionally. Like with Heavy Metal, the stories hit sharp just often enough that I'd revisit every once in awhile. This collection couldn't keep me interested long enough to finish.Just really not terribly good."
2,Not a paint by numbers book,"The name is misleading. In order to paint any of these, you need to photocopy and enlarge everything or sketch the outlines in the book onto a canvas. Also, even the outlines are vague. It says these masterpieces are not conducive to a PBN style homage so it's best to really look at a copy of the original while trying to replicate it with the vague number patterns given in this book. It is a good informational book but not a paint-by-numbers."
2,An overpriced Harlequin Romance,"If you like stories like this, you can get them for around [price] at the supermarket checkout. Except for the fact that it was published in hardcover, this book has no discernible differences from the pulp romance genre. A young 23 year old woman, engaged to be married, undergoes a life-altering transition when her young, dashing fiancee becomes paralyzed! She escapes her contrained life by fleeing to New York and taking another lover--she also pursues her dream of becoming a fashion designer.. . .the sex scenes (frequent) are hilarious--full of euphemisms like ""he pressed 'himself' into her""--also reminiscent of the Harlequin romance-genre. As a bland, predictable romance--it's okay. But to somehow claim that this book approaches ""good literature"" is just plain wrong. If you're in the mood for this kind of book--toss it in the shopping cart with the milk and eggs."
1,The unlikeable Carrie Bell,"I did not care for this book at all. I thought the first half of the book was very believable and thought-provoking. You might not like her character, but at least Carrie was facing truly deep moral issues...but then the second half of the book just proves that your first impression of Carrie was actually right. She is a shallow, young, clueless girl that is pretty much a loser. Not the ""deep-angst, I feel sorry for your inner turmoil"" loser, just a loser. She could not make a commitment to anything or anyone and therefore, left the end of the story to be flat. I like flawed characters, but Carrie was just see-through without any connection to the reader."
1,Don't waste your time,"I don't understand the positive reviews for this book. It was a big disappointment. I felt like I was reading a Judy Blume book - this book feels like it is written for teenagers. The characters are two dimensional and the literary devices cliche. I was angry for wasting my time with this book, but kept reading to see if it got better. It didn't. If you are at all curious, read the first and last four pages of this clunker. Not much happens in between."
2,Dreadful & sophomoric,"The main character's ""friends"" from Wisconsin are incredibly immature and unworldly; she decides to dump them for NY, and starts to have an interesting life; but she ends up dumping NY to return to a ridiculous life at home with her mother and immature friends. Her choices were dreadful. Don't bother - there's no depth here."
3,Altruism at its Worst,"I confess that I am probably a very selfish person and would not sacrifice myself for someone I did not love. I liked the book and it was a good read, until the ending, which was not realistic and totally unconvincing. The worst part of the ending is that it depressed me, considering that the young woman, from the very beginning of the novel, before the accident, wants out of the relationship. To satisfy a girlfriend, she returns, after running away from her hometown and deliberately sabotages her future knowing that she will not go back to the life she was starting to build in New York. I neither admire her nor do I applaud her self-sacrificing decision."
1,The Dive from Clausen's Pier,"Started off with a great deal of promise... but I was physically unable to finish. A truly horrific main character, who inspired nothing less than repulsion and dismay. The book quickly became unrealistic, as how anyone could covet such a selfish, spoiled person is beyond me. Strong first 75 pages followed by a great deal of unbearable repetition and needless detail. Do yourself a favor and AVOID."
3,Good but long,"I thought the plot of this book was good, but it was diluted by it's length. Several of the decisions Carrie made throughout the book were unrealistic and the characters seemed stereotypical. I love the author's style and I did find myself reading a few extra pages simply to see what Carrie did next. I was left with the feeling that this book was trying to attract a younger audience and I'm not sure it pulled it off."
2,The hype doesn't make sense,"Reading this book was mostly frustrating. I too didn't like Carrie (or Kilroy, Jamie, or Mike for that matter) or her snobbery about the midwest (although I have no objection to Carrie's main decision after Mike's paralysis).But being a frustrating read with an unlikable characters doesn't MAKE a book bad. Dive From Clausen's Pier could have been an interesting book had the motivations for people's actions been realistic or well-explained. But they weren't! I have no idea what Carrie is thinking at the end and why she thinks she is making a good decision. What kept me reading was the big ""secret"" about Kilroy that was dangled in front of you for most of the book. It turned out to be completely unsatisfying and unrealistic as a reason for why he is the way he is.I really don't get this book."
3,Bitter Sweet Mythical Story of Loss,"As tough a book to start as to finish, which only kept myinterest for too few days.I spent all the while wondering if Carrie Bell would ever go back to Madison and stay!When she began her love affair with Mike and then left after his tragic dive off the pier, it was likely she could find a new life even in Manhattan! Kilroy and friends Simon and Lane never quite fulfilled those friends she had left behind in Madison. As she often thought, ""When I am with Kilroy I think of Mike and when I am with Mike I think of Kilroy!""As I passed the halfway point it seemed to become more tedious reading. Maybe that was the hidden intent of Ann Packer's effort to try spicing the Manhattan affair with Kilroy too much with the sexual connection! Maybe enough is enough and the next book will have its' own spicey affairs! Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood"
3,"Good Read, Just Curb The Hype","This novel begins with a bang, middles with a whimper and ends strongly. The mid-section needs some work, but overall, a solid story. Some readers have criticized the main character for her selfishness, but I must admit that I identified with her. Put the hype aside and read it on its own terms. Or, pick up another first novel and give it the same level of attention this one has received."
3,Remember the name Ann Packer,"Ok, I know what you're thinking. He writes ""Remember the name Ann Packer"" and yet he gives the book 3 stars? Yes and here's why.This book grabs you with it's premise (think guilt in large amounts) but doesn't sustain itself to the end. Side characters fascinate yet the main character becomes more, um, self-centered and wishy-washy as the novel rolls on. (Side note, writers, please don't make your lead character annoying throughout the entire book.)What this book does entice you with, beyond its premise, is its character insights, the author's ability to write distinct, unique and interesting characters with complex thoughts and emotions. You don't read many writers who can create so many living characters within a single novel. It's what makes Dostoevsky such a great writer and it is what holds promise for Ann Packer's FUTURE efforts. If Ann Packer can create a plot to go with her obvious skill as a writer, she'll create a very special book. Mark my words."
3,a slightly hesitant recommendation,"I read this book knowing that it had changed people's lives, so maybe I expected too much, but while I thought the book was wonderfully written I was never able to fully sympathize with the main character, Carrie Bell. The book begins with Carrie's fiance diving off a pier into a too-low Wisconsin lake and becoming paralyzed; however, the real tragedy is that Carrie had already decided to break up with him when the event occurs, and blames herself for the accident. As Mike comes out of his coma and enters physical therapy, Carrie begins making drastic decisions about her life and future, but seems to execute them impulsively with little thought to the ripple of consequences affecting everyone around her. I would still recommend the book. It will hit close to home for a lot of people (it did for me), but nevertheless, some of the details just didn't ring true."
2,"Overhyped, underwritten","I had heard and read so much praise for this book, I ran out to buy it the day it came out in paperback. What a huge disappointment. I felt like I was reading the script for a Lifetime TV movie of the week. After Carrie moved to NY, it was all downhill. Ridiculous situations, thinly written characters, and a sappy ending. I skimmed the last 100 pages just for plot, and to find out what choice she made. By the end, I just didn't care."
3,Has Potential,"I started out liking the book. The plot-after an accident paralyzing her fiance, Carrie flees to New York-was intriguing. Then the story begins to fall apart, especially with character development. What were Mrs. Wolf, Carrie's father, Kilroy about? How could Carrie ""love"" Kilroy when he didn't even know himself? Also the ending was confusing and vague.Bits and pieces of the book were excellent, but the whole was uneven and unreal."
2,Good Until the End,"I really liked this book at first. It was a little slow to get into it, but once Carrie ran away to New York, it picked up. However, in the end, it turned out to be a book about a girl who settles because she doesn't have the courage to follow her dreams. And apparently she's very good at ""out of sight, out of mind."" Not exactly a protagonist you can root for. One good thing came out of it, though. I got the sewing bug."
2,The Dive from Claussen's Pier,"I could not get through this book, for me it was torture to finally finish it. I would not recommend it, too boring and the story drags on and on.So glad to have finished it and cannot believe that Good Morning America choose this book for their bookclub. Needless to say I will not ever take another book recommendation from them and their bookclub."
2,Worst dialog I've read in a long time,"This book is so horribly written at times I want to heave it across the room. My dog keeps looking up at me as I read with confused, questioning eyes as I groan over and over, unbelieving how bad the dialog can be. It is completely juvenile and contrived. And the character Carrie is unlikable and whiney. This book was so highly promoted and recommended that I bought a hardback copy, excited to read it. The premise is interesting and seemingly thought-provoking; the end product is sappy and boring. It's the 'Bridges of Madison County' of 2002. Need I say more?"
1,Hated main character,"Several people I know loved this book and rated it their ""favorite book ever"". I could never get past my dislike for Carrie. I never liked her even before Mike's injury. She never got a job! I hated that about her. I just did not like this book and I think I would have liked it more had Carrie been more likable to me."
4,Great read until the end,"This book caught my attention because I'm personally at a crossroad in my life -- recently part of a massive layoff -- and am actually pursuing a business in creative sewing. Thought this book would ""show me the way"" that a woman gets past her dependence on men and makes her own way.While I did enjoy the characters in the book, especially the people in New York, the ending was a huge disappointment.It's an enjoyable book."
3,Wanted to Like It More,"After reading an engaging review of this book I felt like I should have liked it more than I did. Having spent 7 years in Madison, WI, the people and places were all there and the author even assumed we knew Madison by telling us what streets Carrie would take home. But almost from the get-go I couldn't empathize because I just hated the characters. Their dialogue was insipid and predictable.Points to Ms. Packer for addressing the point of ""What do we owe the people that we love?"" Do we owe them our very lives? She could have gone deeper into Carrie's feelings, but then again, Carrie didn't have any. She goes to New York and lives on the cheap. Finds an older lover, Kilroy, who is jaded and bookish and is actually the most believable character.I just expected more from the buzz surrounding this author's first novel. Probably going to be on Oprah's Book Club within the year."
3,A Good Read almost 4 stars,"A very well done first novel.Fulton tells a story about a blue collar family who has moved to Salt Lake City so the father can take classes to get a better job. The kids aren't happy about the move, especially after the boy gets beat up by a bunch of Mormon boys who dissaprove of his atheism. The father, a really angry guy, flunks out of his classes, and the Mother struggles to keep her family together. Not as gloomy as it sounds, because the characters are genuinely sympathetic. Very realistic story telling, well written, I liked it very much."
2,Wide range of bushings for different cars,"I returned this kit because it includes parts for a wide range of vehicles, about half of which I cannot use for my A3 Jetta. This was not stated in the description so I see it as false advertising. I decided to just buy the parts I need individually. Why get stuck with parts I don't even need?The kit includes the following parts which you can look up on Prothane's website:22-1101 SWAY BAR 19MM22-1301 1 ADJ STRUT BUMP STOP22-202 FRT C-ARM BUSHING22-302 REAR AXLE KIT22-303 REAR AXLE KIT (These are rear axle bushing inserts)22-702 RACK & PINON BUSHING22-902 REAR SHOCK TWR BUSH. 85&L; (for old cars)"
2,Flimsy Construction,"The extension arm that connects the adapter to the camera seems especially weak, particularly at the point where the arm and the adapter connect (the unit is designed to allow the adapter to disassemble into two pieces). This is particularly evident if you grip just the adapter and not the camera. Although my camera is quite light, the arm flexed enough under its weight that I had serious reservations as to whether it might not snap off and send my camera crashing to the ground. I ended up strengthening the arm with a stip of metal."
2,Sunpak Flash Adapter,"Sunpak Digital Camera Flash Adapter's build is like a toy! The advertisement is ""universal"" but it cannot take my Nikon flash physically (so I don't know whether the electronics work together). Of course it is returned to the seller."
1,This stuff is a joke!,"Entirely too much money for something that absolutely does not work. Save yourself the time and expense for now and have your MD apply liquid nitrogen to the wart during your next routine visit. The majority of clinics keep a supply of liquid nitrogen available for this purpose. They pour a little into a cup, soak a Q-tip, apply it to your wart and, in about a week, the dead wart/skin falls off. Period."
2,Don't waste your money!!!,"We tried this product on my 5 year old who has a rather large (1 cm) wart on the heel of her foot. She was very brave in letting us scrape the dead skin off the wart (a very important step)--a few times until it bleed. We always held the freeze-away tip for at least 40 seconds and then also went around the edges of the wart w/the applicator for a bit (a physician gave us this tip). After 9 treatments the wart is only minimally smaller. We should have just went to the dr. to begin with! We have had success in the past using Compound W and duct tape but nothing would stick to my daughter's foot at the location of the wart. So, unless your wart in tiny, save your money!"
1,Please do not waste your money.,The e-book download is a 4 page document that has nothing whatsoever that is useful for the present time. It is a basic document recommending that one patch the system - that is hardly anything new. It is copyrighted 2001 as well. Ancient history in the Computer Internet World and no one should be paying for this. So definitely not worth US $...
3,REMIXES ONLY,"I was disappointed in this cd, because it didn't have the original song on it. #3 and #5 are good. #5 is the song they remixed the video with."
1,So not as nice as the picture,"I am the designated cake designer for my cousins wedding. When we saw this stand we thought we got lucky with the price. Boy were we surprised when we received this. First it smelled as if it lived in an attic for a very long time. Second it arrived with all these small brown spots over the entire top, along with some brown smudges on the side. When I notified the company they shipped another one free of charge. I waited the week for the next one to arrive only for it to be in the same condition! The seller ended up refunding us, letting us keep these damaged ones, they said they were obviously having an issue with ther supplier, but now we have to figure out a solution to fixing them or go out and spend even more money on a hopefully better quality stand. Huge bummer."
4,A great story with some flaws,"I'd give this anime a 7/10 but I'll round up to 4 stars because the story was fantastic. The price was acceptable. I don't wan't to reveal to much but the action is great if that is what you are looking for in an anime and the story is engaging but the animation at some points is rough. Also, I would have enjoyed it more if it was more serious but it falls prey to immaturity at times as many serious anime's do. But it is worth the watch and isn't excessively long. It is also a bargain. If you are looking for an action anime series and don't mind a few immature scenes then I highly recommend."
3,More techincal than I wanted,"I was looking for a book to help sketch rooms. This book is very precise on how to draw to scale. If that is what you are looking for, then it's great, but I wanted a bit more on drawing more loosely, tips on drawing rooms to show to clients."
5,Works Wonderfully!!,"I bout this, along with a hamburger press, to measure and make ahead of time hamburger patties. I have a pool and barbeque regularly on the weekends. This suite my needs perfectly."
1,guess amazon thinks chrome = cheap plastic,"this scale is made out of cheap plastic, not chrome. it's also not accurate at all, nevermind legal for trade or any kind of business."
1,I returned this book...,"I thought the book sucked. I'm an ASP developer, and having learned and produced many quality projects on the WROX series, I thought this book was thin with ""how to"" and was very ""high level.""I like to get my hands on it immediately with the how's and why's of an object. I don't feel this book did justice that way. It was like taking a crappy class at MS DevDays or something.Whatever... I'm picky. You may like this book, but I think there's better ones out there."
5,An elegant and informed look at markets,"Kindelberger's work is a classic study of speculative bubbles and their consequences, and should be read as such. From the first, this is a book that aims to seperate market moves from genuine crises - important in an age were there is a tendancy for the media to seek to dramatise the mundane in order to winn a BAFTA. The definitions provide a framework for examining the development of an irrational interlude in financial markets.Kindelberger's analysis is not, therefore, a classic ""history"" primer for the curious - there is no spoonfeeding of facts, for that is not what the book sets out to present. Instead, this is an elegant and informed look at what how financial markets have departed from the course theoretical ""rational"" behaviour suggests that they should have taken. For all that, it is still an accessible text to those who take a casual interest in financial markets."
3,Reproduction not the best,"These pages are reproduced photographs of the comic book pages, not reproduced from the original art, so they look like photographs of a newsprint page-- not as crisp or bright in color as the original comic book, though they are about as good as can be done without going back to the original inked drawings and re-coloring them. If you were to buy the original comics they would probably cost about $4 to $5 a book, so this format is the bargain, but not by much.As to content, don't let the obsessive Star Trek nerds fool you; these are fun, vintage stories with good artwork done by Gold Key, the premier movie and TV-to-comic book company of the '60s."
3,"Cute artwork, but design could use some work","My son is obsessed with Cars, so he was overjoyed to get this potty seat, and finally expressed some interest in sitting on the potty as a result. However, the design isn't ideal - the character images are only located on the plastic flap that sticks up on the back of the seat, which means he's always trying to turn around to see Mater & Lightning McQueen, rather than face forward to actually use the toilet. And the pee-cup is pretty snug, with the space between the cup and the handles only fitting a smaller child's thighs. My son is very small for a 2-year-old, so a larger child would have some difficulty with this.But it's cute, and easy to clean, and does what it's supposed to do - get them interested in sitting on the potty."
2,Pretty looking but it stinks,This is very pretty looking seat but with all those parts cleaning is a hassle. Handle and the guard is awesome but in that complicated design urine gets traped and it STINKS. for me it's not possible to clean all the parts everytime my son uses it and i try to wipe it clean with clorox wipes but still unless and until I wash it with soap water it STINKS..I won't recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to spend 5-10 mins after each use cleaning it and disassembling and assembling ( it's quiet easy but 10 times a day it's time consuming)seat together.
2,Pee time,My grandson didn't do well with this. The cup isn't tall enough and he peed all over the place.
2,Better choices are there,I bought this potty seat while we already had the 'Dora' potty seat. I prefer the 'Dora' potty seat over this one mainly because:1.) The hole in this potty seat is too small and therefore I am always afraid that it may be soiled.2.) It does not fit into the potty unlike the 'Dora' potty seat. You have to just place it on the potty. Therefore it is more likely that it may fall off.Also the seat quality of 'Dora' training potty seat seems much better than this one.
2,Won't stay together,Seat has too much foam and top and bottom piece will not stay latched together. Would not buy this seat again.
3,Design NOT as advertised,"The potty seat is wonderful. My son likes it. BUT, the seat is NOT as advertised. I was expecting one exactly like the picture....... instead I got one that is still pooh but it is LIME GREEN. The plastic is lime green and the seat is the same green with honeypots and bees and trees.... ect..... I was kind of looking for something that wouldn't be as much of an eyesore and I thought the blue (our bathroom is blue) and white seat was great for our needs..... lime green on the other hand? not so much."
5,Satisified,"Our 2 year old daughter was on the small-side when she started potty training so sitting on the big potty was a little scary for her. The handles on the side and the little brace on the back helped her feel more stable. I would recommend it for small toddlers who might fell a little insecure sitting on the adult-size toilet at first. It does look nice too, so we don't mind having it sitting in our bathroom."
3,Gross,"Im not sure if it's all potty trainers, but this thing is gross. Pee gets all up between the cushion and the base and you have to clean it out very frequently. Eventually the smell gets stuck and it's trash. Great product if you need one last nasty potty-training helper before you throw your hands up and say ""it's big-potty time!"" I recommend a stool. ;)"
3,Works but can scare timid new trainers,"This works well. She sat on it right away, however, she is timid and sensitive. As she was attempting to get off, the seat slid out from under her and fell off and she tipped back into the toilet.Good idea, the seat is the right sized for her but the inner ring that keeps it snug on toilets, needs to be longer and a little wider.She loves the design and the handles, but I have to be right there keeping it still in order for her to even THINK about sitting down now."
2,"Nothing special, poorly sized","These socks are nothing out of the ordinary, just plain old wool socks. To make matters worse, they do not have enough elastic, so they fall down your leg within minutes of putting them on. My search for a replacement for the Gold Toe wool sock continues."
5,youth alive - jump to the jam,i had boughten this music cd for my son for Christmas. he plays it all the time. it truly is directed toward the youth. many upbeets. this cd was very hard to find. my kids worn out the 1st one i had. this is their second one. i recommend it for any teenager.
4,Accessory Lens,The lenes and filters work great as long as you take the picture during the day time. The extra length on the lens causes a shadow in the right corner. Over all very satified with the product and the seller.
1,Almost unreadable on my iPad,"As others have mentioned, this is a very low resolution scan of the graphic novel. It's difficult to read, and zooming in doesn't help. Very poorly done; I don't recommend it."
1,Air Bud DVD,I was happy with the fast shipping however while watching the movie it gets stuck twice in 2 different parts of the movie so I imagine it has some scratches on it so I was not especially pleased with my purchase.
3,Air Head,"Okay kiddie flick starts out fine but quickly degenerates into sugary territory as the big game comes up, and the dog's original evil owner wants him back. Padded courtroom climax does not help."
3,Wonderful acocunt of the life of Peter Paul Rubens,"If you admire Flemish Baroque art and admire Rubens, this book is for you. An intertesting and educational documentation of his life. See parts of him you never knew. Excellent source for studying and guide for Baroque art."
2,ITS SHORT!,"im only 5'4"" and it doesnt even come up to my chest. If it were a foot longer, I would have liked this a lot more, but it seems as though this was meant for a child, but they didnt advertise it that way. I would not have bought it if I had looked at the length."
4,This toy is awesome !,"I bought this for my 9 year old. We looked at the confusing directions for hours (The directions said connect the ""switch plate"" to the McFlurry Maker ""base"" and didn't describe the piece, they showed a poorly drawn picture.) We spun the crank for 5 minutes and dispensed the McFlurry (the ice cream only filled up one-third of the cup) and added sprinkles & cookies. The McFlurry didn't taste so bad, but it is a small amount. Your'e better off just buying real McFlurries."
1,MCFLURRY MAKER NOT A GOOD IDEA,I BOUGHT THIS FOR CHRISTMAS FOR MY 11 YEAR OLD. AND THE ONLY THING WE MADE FROM THIS WAS A BIG MESS. ONE PERSON HAS TO HOLD THE MACHINE TOGETHER WHILE THE OTHER TURNS THE KNOB.<br />NEVER AGAIN. THIS WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. WE'LL JUST GO TO THE MCDONALDS DRIVE THRU FROM NOW ON.
1,McFloppy Maker,"I got the thing for Christmas thinking ok even though I'm 16 (at the time,2003) this still might be fun, right? Wrong! First of you have to buy cream, & add a salt & water mix to the top just to make a serving of the stuff that only fills about half of the cup. Then it's not really ice cream it's just creamy liquid that if you don't eat it quick enough turns into nasty foam. Also in order to get it even remotely thick you have to turn the crank ontop forever! If you put it together to loosely you can end up with a salty liquid mess. Trust an old time icecream maker would be a better invetsment & much more nostalgic."
1,Don't buy this item,This toy is worthless. It does not work. What disappointment! This was a gift for my nephews. What a waste of money.
1,don't waste your time,"This item is not what was expected. First it uses only half and half. Second, it is pretty cheaply made."
1,Don't bother,"I purchased this as a gift for my 11 year old daughter. Putting it together was a bit more complicated than I would expect, and she couldn't put it together herself. I was surprised to learn you need 3/4 cup of salt each time you use it. After all the spinning and trying to get the stuff to come out and into the cup my daughter commented, ""I'd rather go to McDonald's"". Don't bother with this item. It's an impracticle waste of money."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I have tried to make a McFlurry 5 times, and each time I had to freeze the mixture in the freezer just to get something other than milk. In other words, the mixture never gets thick, even after 10 minutes of cranking. And, I have worked at McDonald's in the past, so I have good idea of what to do. It took me awhile to put together, only to discover I had to run out to the store for Half & Half and salt. My son was bored watching me crank the toy, and only tried it for about 30 seconds before giving up. The people who have had results with this toy are LUCKY, it was a waste of money. I am glad I bought it on sale."
1,McFlurry Anyone? I don't think so.,"I think that I was the one who wanted this product more than my son did, and boy, were we both disappointed. The assembly was complicated as it says, ""to assemble reverse steps 1-11"". The cranking was very difficult, even for me. The end result? A puddle of ""ice cream"" in a cup. There was about an ounce of ice cream in it. 2 packages of dessert treat? That's barely worth the price. My advice is.....DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Head out to your local McDonald's and buy a McFlurry.....you'll get your money's worth there at least."
2,don't bother with this one,very poor instructions leading to lots of frustration on the grown ups part! Pathetic small amount of ice cream made and the parts cannot even go in the dishwasher. Refills are outrageuosly expensive for what they are. Wish we hadn't wasted the money. Can't see us using it very often.
1,Waste of $17.00,"Thi McFlurry Maker doesn't make anything more than vanilla tasting cream! The machine does m=not freeze the stuff you put in it and it's hard to wash. If you turn the crank handle too fast, it flies off! I amvery disappointed in this item. DO NOT BUY!"
2,"Yummy, but a hassle....","Well, for the life of me, I could not put this thing together. The kids and I opted to wait for my engineering degree'd husband to come home and do it...and even he found it difficult! Once it is put together, you then need to make sure you have half & half in the house (3/4 cup), ice and 3/4 cup (!) of salt (to pour over the ice and make it colder). Yes - the finished product is very tasty, but not very big. The kids got a kick out of it, so here I am buying refills already (it only comes with enough to make 2 servings.) So, if you don't mind doing this with your young kids (mine are 4 & 8), then go for it. Keep in mind, there are many parts that need assembling/disassembling, washing and putting away."
3,JC's McFlurry Review,"It's a lot of hard work. The assembly and cleanup is frustrating, but the results taste great!"
1,Not worth the hassle,"Don't waste your time or money.Requires adult help to put together and to use. It is not worth the hassle, very messy and hard for children to use. My grandson said it was boring and to hard for him to turn the crank!"
2,NOT AS FUN OR EASY IT LOOKS!!!,"My daughter wanted this flurry maker sooo bad, so we finally gave in & got it for her for Christmas last year. What a mistake that was!! She was thrilled & is thrilled everytime we make flurries (which isn't very often). It's a pain to put together & take apart, she can't turn it by herself, which at 4 she wants to do, & it doesn't tast anything like the flurry you get at McDonalds. I would recommend going to McDonalds & buying a flurry rather than wasting money on this!!!"
1,Spend your money on something else....,"Worst toy ever!!! We bought this for my son for Christmas. It was difficult to put together at first. The written directions are worthless but, the picture helped. My son had a hard time putting it together with out our help. The mix was messy & hard for him to crank. Plus the re-fills are expensive. Cleaning all the little parts each time was a pain for me. This was definatly a big dissapointment on Christmas morning for him. The money we spent on this product would have been better spent on anything else. We already threw it away. Save your money- use your blender to make milkshakes, and let your kids put on thier own sprinkles- it's easier to clean, and the kids actually get instant gratification that way."
1,What a Waste of Money,"I'm about to throw this McFlurry Maker out. Too hard to put together, and takes forever to make. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!"
1,Mc Weird,"There is no way the McFlurry Maker makes McFlurries. I have a college degree and the instructions make no sense. The sludge that comes out of that machine does not remotely resemble a true McFlurry. My kids cried their eyes out when the &quot;product&quot; came out. If you want a McFlurry, go to McDonalds."
2,bed tent,"I Received the tent and sent it as a gift. The child had no comments, other than he liked it."
1,Made in China-poor quality,"Pfaltzgraff quality is poor now that the product is made in China. I own a set of Grapevine dishes made in USA and I purchased a set of Winterberry dishes for my mother made in USA prior to 2005 (when they sold the company). Last year I purchased a set of Winterberry for myself but returned them because the glaze was uneven, the colors were not the same and they could not compare to my Mom's set. I will never buy another Pfaltzgraff product."
2,An elementary survey of machining,"This is a basic introductory textbook of machining. It explains what most machine tools are and how they work in simple language and padded with copious, though often uninformative pictures (e.g. the cover page for the chapter on CNC machining shows a picture of an old manual Bridgeport). It also includes some elementary instructions on common machining operations like using a center finder, cutting threads on a lathe, etc. However, it is much too brief to be considered an actual manual of machine shop practice.It is in textbook format and has simple questions at the end of each chapter. It seems like it would be a suitable overview text for a high school machine shop class. I think the title, ""...from basic to advanced techniques"" is misleading. There are no advanced techniques here, unless you consider the several paragraph descriptions of things like EDM and explosive forming to be advanced techniques."
3,No Cyrillic?,"This is a pretty handle little book, no doubt, but one thing that makes it difficult to learn the sound or intonation of Chechen words without the aid of the Russian Cyrillic will be much harder pressed to emulate Chechen words.It gets the job done, for sure. However, it would have better-served the learner if the alphabet had been in the Cyrillic format."
5,Lyrical take on the tale of Pandora,"""The jar is not to be opened! No. Never. Never. The gods have commanded it. The gods have commanded it!"" - thus Pandora has been warned, and yet despite numerous warnings from her husband Epimetheus and servant Xerxes, the beautiful Pandora's curiosity will not be sated until she opens the jar and faces the consequences. The story here is written in verse form and flows well, carrying the reader along with the story - and makes for a great read-aloud for elementary age students. My 5-year-old daughter enjoyed this story immensely and the beautiful full-color illustrations make this a visually-appealing tale as well. There is even a list of character's names and their significance. I'd recommend this to children ages 5 and up."
3,Great Pipes! --- Intrusive Organ,"This CD is very hard to rate. I'd love to give it 5 stars becaue Zamfir plays achingly beautifully on the pipes, with many ""Doinas"" - slow mournful tunes which really tug at the heart, but then that stupid organ accompaniment intrudes...never goes away..one long chord after another..almost like a practice partner rather than a true accompaniment. If I could find these same pieces played with a better accompaniment that would really be a 5 star disk. I have to lower the rating because (for me) the bad accompaniment drags it way down."
2,"Older EC. Some not so good, some excellent!","All these recordings are older, previously released on numerous CDs and LPs. Some you'll like for sure like most anything from the Beano (Bluesbreakers)collection and some of the independent (when EC wasn't with a particular band) but some stuff like the yardbirds will definatly sound old,odd,weird, and just BAD."
2,Overwhelming,This book was overwhelming and disorganized - what I mean was that there lacked a unifying theme; a little legalistic. The indicative should come before the imperative.
1,Mislabeled part?,"During the installation of an electric drive system for my boat, the Boss 100A circuit breaker was used for circuit protection. After the installation was completed, I discovered that the system could only be operated up to about 70% of full speed without tripping the circuit breaker. Further testing revealed the circuit breaker opens at approximately 50 amps. The breaker is either defective or was mislabeled during manufacture. By this time the 30 day return period had passed and I have no option but to buy another part (won't be this brand)."
4,Great intro to American animation history!,"Well written, concise survey of American animation history. The only slights are that he doesn't have much to say on non-Disney animated efforts of the past decade, especially television animation, and that too many pages praise the horrendous UPA 'toons. Otherwise, this is a great intro to a neglected sector of American culture. If you want to learn about cartoons without buying a separate book on each major company, this should be your choice"
5,A beautiful book!,"This is a wonderful book to help children learn about the months and the seasons. To the criticism of the other reviewer who complained that there are only white people in this book, that is true, but the people are a very small part of this book. The emphasis is on nature, particularly birds, and that reviewer is ignoring a great resource if she refuses to use this book for it's obvious purpose - to teach the months and seasons. If you ignore every book that only has white people, you will cheating children out of some really terrific books. When I think of all the great books I read growing up that only had pictures of white people, I shudder to think that my parents (or librarians!) could have denied me any of them because of color of the people in them."
3,Beautifully rendered book w/ a narrow perspective,"As a youth services librarian at a large metropolitan library, I am always looking for large format, simple, appealing books for toddlers and their families. While this book is certainly lovely, I will not be recommending it or using in any of my storytelling programs because the people illustrated in this book are all white, and it does not reflect my community or many other communities today. It is truly surprising how many new children's books only feature white people. As one of those white people, I am offended and disappointed in publishers and illustrators who perpetuate this bias."
3,Glad that I (re) found it.,"I have been looking for this book/title for 2 years. I recall loving this as a child and because it's out of print, I had not been able to find it. Couldn't even recall the title. After numerous searches, somehow, it finally popped up. I still love the art and I like the story of the little chestnut tree. Sweet. I didn't recall the heavy ""green"" angle which is great if you're eco-oriented. (A little too preachy on that, imo, but I know that some will enjoy.) Anyway, it's a nice book, especially if you like older books for your children's collection."
3,not what was shown in pic,The item did come in very good condition just like it said but it was not the book shown on the pic that I ordered. The one i got i already had.
2,Flimsy product,Not the quality I was expecting. OK for the age group 3. Will get a more substantial gift next time.
2,Save Your money - don't buy it!,For an accelerated guide - this book has too much fluff. It does not present material in a manner that is amenable to studying for the exam. It has all the elements that make those wrist-spraining tomes from other publishers such a waste of money. I used McGraw Hill's study guide for the other exams and found it to be excellent. This book on the other hand is useless if you are looking to study for the exam and it is even more useless as a review guide even if you know the material. There is a real paucity of books on the material so I cannot recommend anything in particular. I used lotus' syllabus and made notes from various books and documentation and passed the exam. Good luck!
2,Disappointing,"Though this stroller is extremely lightweight and easy to push, there are a few design flaws that made me put it in the basement and search for a replacement. First, the handlebar is very low. I am 5'7"" and I kick the wheels about every third step. Second, the canopy hardly shades my daughter at all as it doesn't extend very far. Third, the adult cup holder broke off the very first time I took the stroller out of the car. Fourth, you can only open/close it with both hands, impossible to do otherwise. Lastly, to use it with the carseat was frustrating. It took many adjustments to ever get the carseat to lock into place. I have since replaced it with the Combi Torino."
3,"Great design, but didn't last long","Bought this model seven years ago. Was the best looking faucet in it's price range. After four years, using hot water would actually ""self-shut off"". Sorta funny actually. When the water was still cold it would run and then as soon as it heated up the faucet handle would move down and turn itself off! We've liked the design so much that we put up with it for another few years that way. We would simply turn it back on again and it would remain on. Last week, though, the unit started squeaking loudly when we rotated the base from one side of the sink to the other. It is a very loud squeak. At that point we decided to purchase a new faucet. This time we went for Kohler. Yes, it was more money. I guess you get what you pay for!"
4,A beautifully illustrated book,I was intrigued by the piece on NPR and was pleasantly surprised to see that the illustrations were really striking...as engaging as the poems I heard on the air. The book appeals to silliness in adults and children. Got it for a friend's daughter who enjoys imagining other things that might be in Eliza's jacket pockets.
4,Great little oven,"This replaced out toaster oven. works great except it is missing a timer function. The toasting function is timed, but nothing for baking. Bummer.The included baking stone does a great job with pizzas. the included pizza dough recipes came out great.The unit does wobble out of the box, you have to adjust the one leg by twisting it to the proper length. Rock solid and level now!"
4,nice product,"I guess I just didn't read the description closely. I found this product listed as a convection oven, which it is not. In fact I found it listed today as a convection oven. However that does not detract from its performance as a countertop oven. I used it to bake potatoes and broil tenderloin for the same meal and it did both quite well."
1,Cuisinart Brick Oven Classic Stainless Steel,"I purchased this item (from another source). It looks very attractive, fairly spacious, and easy to operate. However, it basically died in 30 days! The oven stopped heating effectively, the indicator lights kept flashing off and on, and the interior oven light (always lit in ON mode) kept going on and off.I made the unfortunate mistake of purchasing two of these items, based on aesthetic appearance and simple functionality. Obviously a huge mistake on my part. If you do buy this, assuming my experience is an anomaly (which it may be), I would strongly suggest retaining all receipts, documentation and original carton. You MAY end up needing it!"
2,Jason made it!,"3 cds, 3 different lead singers... Although I enjoyed The Moon Is Down very much, Chris Carrabba as lead singer did not click with the rest of the band and the vibe of the music... when Jason Gleason took the position of lead singer, FSF went from being a band I listened to, to one of my favorites. He had so much passion, and you felt every word that came out of his mouth... not to mention his live performances were incredible! Even fans of FSF who were sad to see Chris pursue his own career cannot arugue that Jason was an amazing singer and performer. Hide Nothing doesnt do much for me, the lyrics are nothing to talk about, And I enjoyed Jon much better is sense field. The passion that Jason brought to the music left with him! The best FSF album will always be HOW TO START A FIRE!"
4,Excellent book told in the inimitable Miller style,"Ann Miller, one of the most underappreciated stars of the Golden age, tells all in this book. Focusing on her childhood and her personal life, she recounts memories with a disarming cheeky style that became her trademark. While more information about her work would have been nice, it's great to have Miller by Miller since no other real biography exists. We hear a lot about boyfriends, her fascination with spirituality, and her work as a goodwill ambassador.Bottom Line: An excellent book by Miller, told in her trademark cheeky style. While short on professional details, it's great for private ones and shouldn't be missed by any Miller fan. (great pics, too!)"
4,Very Good,"This is a highly readable autobiography in which Miller's adorable personality really comes through. You feel as if you are sitting in her living room listening to her talk to you personally, telling wonderful stories of her days in Hollywood. Wish there had been more about the making of her various films, but it is still a satisfying read that leaves you believing that you have truly gotten to know her better. Based on this book, I think I would have really liked her. And what an underappreciated talent she was! Just go back and watch some of her old films. They don't make em like that anymore."
1,Takes our signal from non-existant to unwatchable,"If you get a decent signal and are just looking to clean it up, maybe this can help, but if you live in an area with lousy signal, this won't help for squat. I'm about 10 miles from the towers, have the thing aimed directly at them from my first floor living room, and we go from no signal to a signal that cuts out every 10 seconds or so. This might be owed to the topography. Personally, I prefer no signal at all, since you at least don't sit there watching and hoping."
1,picked up 0 stations on Long Island NY,I got 0 stations. ZERO . So i cant comment on quality or how well it works because it did not work unfortuantley.I am sure it is my location - and the few trees i have in my backyard? or it just sucks. I dont know
1,Looks More Powerful Than It Is,"After putting this antenna together, I thought, wow! This will pull in reception from all over the region. Well guess what my 300-ohm twin lead antenna did a better job of receiving signals than did this antenna even with it's amplifier!Not what it's cracked up to be. I sent mine back and will wait until Direct TV has it's 100+ HDTV channels available."
2,Expensive and does not work at well with VHF DTV channels,"I tried this antenna for several months and finally had to give up on it. I live only about 11 miles from the DTV transmitters and it always had to be adjusted to pull in the UHF channels and was quite unreliable for getting the VHF channels, even though it sports a pair of rabbits. The amplifier made zero difference as well, and I found it actually seemed to work much better without it. I now use a $5 set of RCA rabbit ears and can get all the UHF and VHF channels more reliably than I could with the Terk. I tried both the Terk HDTVa and the Terk HDTVi, with similar mediocre results."
1,Unable to pick up almost half of Los Angeles OTA stations,"Very disappointed. Was unable to pick up 3 Los Angeles over the air stations 5, 11 and 13.Most disappointing was inability to pick up local FOX TV station, channel 11 for Sunday afternoon NASCAR race on newly purchased big screen. Fiddled and diddled, daddled and doodled but was unable to get the stations to scan in.Finally gave up and am returning to Amazon for refund."
1,Limited Range,I was unable to get reception. I went to the manufacturer website and they said that I could not get any stations! I would not have ordered it had I checked first!The dealer (6th Avenue) was GREAT! Full refund.
2,A so-so product,"I bought this one to replace my old crappy one, but there is no difference in channels it captures or the picture quality. And its base is too small, very hard to stand still while the cord keeps bulging out."
5,Great for my needs,"I live within 10-15 miles of the towers for the networks. this antenna pulls in all the stations and is unobtrusive enough that I don't get the ""Why do you have to have that in my living room"" look.I had checked out a variety of other antennas before a buddy of mine convinced me that I was going for overkill with the roof-mounted options costing 4x-5x as much. Glad he did. This antenna is very similar to the amplified Zenith offering but for a better price."
5,Money saving genius.,"Cut the cable and buy this! Well, do your research, I live about 11 miles from the towers and they are all in the same location, so I never have to move it. It works awesome."
1,Worse than cheap rabbitt ears,"I used $12 rabbit ears from Amazon for a few months with my Channel Master D2A converter box. They worked okay (in the Arlington, VA area), but some channels were inconsistent. I hoped that highly rated Terk HDTVa would do better, but it only brought in 4 channels (my old cheaper one got about 20). I moved it around the room, tried dozens of different positions, but alas it still didn't work."
2,Not as good as I thought.,"I've tried it three times, once right in Oklahoma City, OK and had no reception whatsoever. Very disappointed."
3,"Better reception, but not great","After the DTV Conversion I still have lost two channels. my reception has more to do with the location of my TV than with the antenna. This antenna works slightly better than my previous one, but it was unable to bring back channels that come through for others in the area."
2,disappointment,"Fancy design, but reception is not so great. Stations easily drop out when it's windy. The RCA 1650 flat amplified antenna I purchased from Amazon does a much better job than the Terk (noticeable difference in the antenna signal strength tool available on my tv). The way the cable sits at the bottom of the Terk base also makes it prone to tipping over."
2,Terk HDTVa Antenna,"This item is the same as the unamplified version of the antenna, but they provide a cheap in-line amplifier with it. The antenna worked great the first week I had it, but then the amplifier quit working. In reading other reviews I found that this is quite common. I would not recommend this product to my friends."
2,Does it work?,"Tired of paying $60+ monthly charges for cable?can't stand your kids hovering over TV programs instead of the homework or reading a book?Well, we decided to cancel our cable TV subscription and tried out the basic OTA digital TV experience.After much review, i selected the Terk amplified HD antenna.I live here in Portland, OR and after testing multiple positioning of the antenna placement, I was able to pick up THREE channels!!ABC, OPB and a Spanish channel. (Not NBC nor CBS)!I replaced the amplified Terk antenna with an passive (none-amplified) $10 antenna and it delivered the SAME # of channels!It did not take long or hard to decide if this is worth it... Thanks to Amazon's policy, i was able to return it based on the fact of this antenna did not pick up the number of channels that are available within my area.also, the internal packaging looks used or previously returned..guess I will look for another antenna that will deliver the performance I am looking for.."
4,Works alright,"With this antenna I'm able to pick up Hi-Def basic cable. I suggest putting it near a window or if you can out the window for the best possible reception. I keep mine inside near the window and it works very nicely, sometimes the picture will mess up if it's raining or snowing hard but other then that, not too many other issues."
3,"Great antena, poor base/stability.","This product works great and IF you can set it up and leave it alone, it is perfect.Thing is, most of us can't do that. You need a larger base on this thing so you can adjust it for best reception without it trying to fall over. I did it with a unusable CD. NO proble and I now love it, period.The stability situation came up due to the rabbit ears that I did not see in the photo.I should have known, but then I might have not bought it and THAT would have been a mistake (IMHO).I do not find the need for a larger base to be a fatal flaw at all. The performance far out weighs it.Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Reception"
5,Great Product,I purchased this for a TV in our basement. It took 5 minutes to set up and after placing it on the ledge inside the small window we had instant access to several crystal clear digital channels. Great investment if you don't need all of the expense of cable boxes on a single TV. You'll probably need another 6 feet of cable and a connector but worth it!
4,Cut the cable!,"I installed this antenna for my parents who live in the Chicago suburbs. It's easy to hook up and easy enough to adjust. We were able to tune into nearly all the ""basic"" cable stations (NBC, ABC, FOX, PBS, etc) as promised. The only station that was difficult to receive was CBS and since my parents like to watch football (even though da bears are on fox), they nixed the antenna. For my sake, when I go home after the holidays I will be cutting the cable and purchasing one of these. Before purchasing make sure you check you area's HDTV reception (google)."
2,Did not work as advertized,"Did not work for me at all - could not receive broadcast channels whereas another simple model, the Mohu Leaf Antenna, works exceptionally well in the same location without amplification."
2,"awkward, bulky, mediocre, overrated","I have owned this product for over a year now.My title said it all. We were using a $50 radio shack antenna and not very happy with our results. After doing some research we settled on the Terk you see here. We were not impressed at all. The signal strength was as weak if not weaker than the Radio Shack Antenna. We live very close to the broadcast towers as well. They are about 5 miles away on top of a mountain. Our house has a clear line of sight to the towers and we still have trouble picking up certain stations. You can't sit or stand in particular places in the living room lest you lose the signal.Another thing: look at how small that base is compared to how gigantic the actual antenna is. It's incredibly awkward and it tips over constantly. It's a ridiculous size. There's just no place for such a silly, bulky antenna in an average size living room. I'm just astounded at all the positive reviews here."
2,Awkward design makes it hard to stand free,"The amplification makes this pull in a lot more stations, but the design is lacking. It looks like they chose to make it look modern rather than considering functionality.The cord comes out of the bottom of the unit and can be moved to the front or back, but either way you move it there is difficulty getting it to stand up straight. The base is so narrow that the antannae has a hard time sitting on a flat survace, constantly falling over, with risk of breaking the antenna when it does. Normally you might fix this by screwing it down, but the base is not designed to allow that as well.Pull in stations nicely, but frustrating design."
5,Don't Even Hesitate -- This Is the One!,"Tried the Mohu - not one single channel. Plugged this one in - got 50 channels right away. Yes it looks hideous, but that's the point. All that iron pulls in every signal in the area."
5,Sensitive!,"I got as real deal on this one. I have a few antennas of various sorts for HDTV, same prices, but different reception. This one was the best. Very satisfied customer."
1,research more,I wish it was easy to find the right item but this product could only get 3 channels in my area. I would check the web sites that offer a range channel list of what the product can and will pick up first before purchasing any digital tv stuff again
4,Best Antenna I've ever owned,"Since most antennas really are only as good as their proximity to the source of the signal, this review will probably only be helpful to Chicagoans.I live in Logan Square, Chicago and Ever since we got this antenna we have been getting great reception. I gave it four stars because it can get finicky on what direction it faces. If it is turned a certain way, I lose signal for a couple channels. Other than that it is a dream. It really works well with our 720p LCD TV. The HD signal is very clear. I also like the design. It comes with a fairly long coaxial cable so you can have some play in where you want to put it. Now, the picture doesn't really show it, but on the opposite side of the horizontal antenna ""fin"" there are two other extendable antennae that are adjustable.Since this is normally priced at $70 dollars in the store, the price here is not bad at all. All in all, we give it two thumbs up."
4,Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna,"I was very pleased that with this antenna I did receive a channel that is over 60 miles away. The reception was of good quality.The ""only"" problem I have with this antenna is that the table footprint is so small that it takes little to tip it over. The cable runs through a slot on the bottom. The cable has a tendency to curve below the flat surface of the footprint. I'll probably use double sided molding tape to fasten the antenna to part of a piece of shelving. That should give it added weight and stability."
5,Indoor antenna,I used a Radio Shack's indoor/outdoor antenna. When used indoors the reception was not good for every station so I moved it outdoors. After almost a year I started losing channels. Bought this Terk and find that I can get better reception indoors (without the amplifier) than the Radio Shack one outdoors.While removing the Radio Shack antenna I found out that it was the connectors that got eroded that caused the reception problem. The antenna still works well and I am keeping it for the 2nd floor TV indoors.I now do not need to worry about connector erosion or getting lightning strikes.
4,Best Antenna so Far,Been playing around with different antennas and this one works best for me. I still don't get a few channels but I don't think I ever will with an indoor antenna due to my location. Picked up a lot more channels than the basic RCA antenna.
4,inside antenna,"I bought this antenna hoping that we could get local channels on our tv. It gets good pictures but you have to move the antenna around for signals on different channels, but I live about 30 miles away from where most of the TV stations are so this might have something to do with it, but overall I'm satisfied with this antenna."
1,Too much trouble,"I bought this because it was top rated. There was no position where I could be assured that any station would have a signal. What worked one day didn't work the next, and almost every channel needed another position. Any movement in the room upset the signal.The antenna is also too large and unwieldy, requiring messing with the rabbit ears as well as the position."
3,Terkish,"Terk HDTV/Digital amplified antenna is adequate, but still will not pick one of the major network stations in my area and do not know why. Otherwise, it is an adequate product."
3,Only good for HD channels reception,"This product will pick up very clear 5-6 HD local channels, ABC, NBC, Fox news, weather channel... The regular non HD channel does not coming clear at all and it's useless. also, it minimizes the channel from freezing up. It has its own cable built in and you cannot use other better cable to upgrade the reception by reducing interference."
4,This is a very good,"This is a very good indoor antenna. I live close to 40 to 50 miles away from the broadcasting area of Houston Texas and I recieved all of the major channels in my area. Most of the time I would get such a clear picture that I would almost forget I was using an indoor antenna. I would say, for the money, you couldn't go wrong with this item. I have recommended this antenna to several of my friends."
2,a tad disappointing,We got this antenna for my daugherinlaw as she can't have an outdoor antenna where she lives and can't get some of her favorite channels but unfortunately this antenna did very little towards solving her problem.
5,This is the only antenna that works the best at home.,"I have tried other antennas that promise a better-than-other-antennas signal, but none of them have come close to this one. I bought the first one two years ago at a local Best Buy store after returning an expensive $50 RCA antenna. I am planning on obtaining another one like this for another TV because I have bought and returned several expensive antennas that only promise but do not deliver. You can't go wrong on this one."
1,A Nightmare,"Have struggled with one of these for 2 years. (I am a huge fan of Terk products and own 4 of their radio antennas, by the way). This antenna requires a huge amount of space to be used properly; imagine a 5 foot diameter footprint; that is what you need. Once aimed it does indeed receive quite well. The problem is that it is an engineering nightmare and needs to be taped down otherwise it tips over if you look at it; no weight in the base. Another problem is that the cables are also a mess; they are stiff and never relax and straighten out, so they too do not help the antenna to stay in place and stand up. Add to all of this, it is a complete eyesore; ugly pile of clutter. I have replaced this with one of the flat rectangular antennas from RCA (in fact, I just purchased a second unit) and it is wonderful."
4,Terk HDTV,"I am very happy with the Terk HDTV antenna, we receive channels we haven't since the digital switch over. We live 40 miles from TV stations and have received weak signals on our regular outside antenna. Picture now is sharp and crisp without the flutters and freezeups."
3,Good product but not for a rural area,"I purchased this product to try to get rid of cable, but we live too far from Baltimore (20 miles) to receive enough channels. The stations we did receive had an excellent HD picture, but the product did not suit my needs."
3,"Works, but not the best in my case","I live in Manhattan.My mistake was to buy a antenna big like this. I thought it was smaller... but no, takes a lot of space and is hard to hide it.Sometimes the image freezes for poor reception. I don't think it should happen where I live with an antenna like that.I think you can buy a better looking antenna with the same characteristics..."
2,Not so hot near Dallas,"For me, where I live between Dallas and Fort Worth, this thing as useless. That could be and probably is completely due to where the attennas are in Dallas and where I am. Just caution to those that buy it... I could only pick up on HD spanish station and then only if I held the thing in my hand and even then the signal was like the old UHF days... ha ha."
2,No better than a $15 antenna,"I live in the Chicago suburbs, where there are plenty of over the air stations available. I bought this antenna, hoping it was an upgrade from the $12 RCA antenna I had purchased 10 years ago. It is not. It wasn't any worse, but it failed to receive the signals from ABC and CBS that I was hoping to get. It was VERY unstable, and I was unable to move the incredibly long rabbit ears into positions that may have actually resulted in better reception because then it would have fallen over. I returned it and went back to my $12 antenna."
3,terk HDTVa,Product would not work on inside wall in house .When I pointed it toward the tv station thru a window it worked ok after a bit of fussing .Would not recomend unless you can aim at station thru window window
1,Ghosts in the TV,"I had great hope for this antenna. Really want to get rid of the leach cable company, but this is not the tool for it, at least in my situation.First off, as others have said, the unit is not stable even a little bit. It wants to fall over and move depending on how the cabling is laid out. Makes it near impossible to maintain a clear station as is. It may work to use velcro to hold it in place.Tuning this thing to bring in a station is next to impossible. Even a slight movement throws the picture off.Now, I will say I'm about 25 miles away from the TV transmitter towers, which is actually well within the specifications of this antenna, but I think you need to be much closer. The reception zone is so small , it is near impossible to achieve clear reception. Even with my converter box hooked up, no joy.Unfortunately, it appears I will need to keep my cable."
5,Good choice,"This is the third antenna I have tried. The first one was an RCA rabbit ears, with no gain. This brought in NBC11. Then I tried an outdoor wineguard antenna, that brought in a few more channels like cbs and abc, but when I ran a long cable from the antenna to the tv, the signal quality dropped and the picture would cut in and out...thats when I came to know about this terk. saw the good reviews on amazon, ordered based on that. got it set up in 5 minutes.First I tired the signal strength without the powered amplifier inline. The signal strength was similar to that of the rca rabbit ears. Next, I turned on the amp, and voila, signal strength shot up from 50 to 80 on most channels. I can now get all the channels listed on the [...] for our location. The long cable to the tv is no problem. very happy with this purchase and would recommend this to everyone.oh yes, it looks good too, and you dont have to extend the dipoles on the back all the way out."
4,it works most of the time,"It receives signals from most of the local channels with the exception of channel 2. However, it must be pointed to different directions for different channels.Overall, it saves some money by replacing the dish network service."
3,As good/bad as RAC ANT-111,"I tried both. Really, RCA 111 that goes on sale at BB for $9.99 does the same job without power supply.I ended up returning this pricy, bulky Terk antenna of course."
2,I thought this was an OK antenna until I tried another,"This is the first antenna I bought for my HDTV. It allowed me to get a few stations, however I knew there were more station around my house that I should be able to get. I tried the antenna in the unidirectional configuration, turning it in different directions, as well as trying it in the omnidirectional configuration. After a few years with the Terk HDTVa, I tried theWinegard FreeVision FV-30BB HDTV Antennawhen I saw it on sale. I placed the FV-30BB in the same place as I had the HDTVa--on a window sill behind the TV. The FV-30BB is cheaper and it allows me to receive twice as many stations as I got with the HDTVa. I don't think I would recommend the Terk HDTVa."
3,Depends on the weather,"I live some 40 miles from the nearast broadcast station and when the weather is calm the picture is strong and clear, but when the weather becomes unsettled the image breaks up a bit.Physical quality of the unit is very good."
4,Indoor Digital Antenna -Good,I have been trying to use my new decoder box and could not get the regular old on-air stations till I used this Terk Antenna ( lower priced then the Phillips ) but with minimal extra tweaking was able to get the lower channels ( ch 2 - 9 ) with the digital clarity and consistent reception that I could not get from other antenna's. All the channels come in clear from the one position.
3,Know what you need first,"There is nothing wrong with this antenna under the right conditions. Unfortunately, I really didn't know why type of antenna I needed before buying this one. Do your research, depending on several factors to include distance, location, and environment, this antenna may or may not be powerful enough for you."
4,"""It is what it is""","If you are tired of paying for cable and are trying to save some revenue, this is working for us. By no means does it compare to the ""Big Buck Providers"" but you also do not have a monthly bill. We are able to receive enough channels (news, weather, the major channels) but then supplement with netflicks etc.. As far as reception, it is very good. We have it installed in the attic, not outside."
4,works not bad,"Hey, it's better than nothing, Jack! HEy Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey hey hey hey hey hey"
4,"Works just OK, maybe we just set it up wrong",We purchased this item because of good former reviews.If we set it up in the right position (just haven't found it yet) I'm sure we'll get great reception. The tuner is very sensitive. We get good reception on most channels. Good for our basic use on a TV we did not set up with our cable (guest room).Recommend this product. Cheaper than buying a new TV.
3,INdoor Antenna HDTV,"Antenna was received promptly and in very good condition. The price, I thought, was a little high for the product. The amplifier has to be installed close to the television.I am receiving signals up to 100 miles with the antenna sitting on top of the TV. The pull out radio type antenna does not seem to have any signal gain whether they are stowed, fully extended, in vertical, or horizontal position. The UHF part works best in the horizontal position.I can receive more channels, with better quality, on the butterfly antenna mounted on top of my RV, while under a large oak tree, than on this antenna.However, this antenna would work satisfactorily if I had been closer to the TV stations. Probably would work great under 50 miles."
2,Powered?,"They mislead me into thinking the power for the signal booster comes from the my existing cable, great! What is actually needed is to plug in the supplied AC/DC converter and install this 6"" length of powered cable inline with the antennae cable, crap!"
4,no moving the antenna,This antenna is great. I tried two other antennas that both cost me $20 and $40 bucks at best buy and I had to constanly move them around to get a steady signal. Wiht this terk antenna theres is no moving the antenna to get a great picture. I just set it up and thats it i get all the HD channel without messing with it. kinda big though.
5,Can't go wrong!!!,I am 45 mins from Chicago and I am getting a great HD reception. I don't really care for non HD channels so I don't have the other two antennas sticking out! I get 26 digital channels which is pretty darn good!I am so satisfied that I am ordering another one for my bed room! :)
2,Terk Bunny Ears work better!,"If you live in NYC or the New York City area, the Terk bunny ears work much better. The HDTVa is probably too big for an NYC apartment and requires it's own stand. Also, it's UGLY."
1,HDTV antenna,"I bought this antenna based on the many wonderful reviews it got, for me it did not work, I live about sixty five miles outside of New York City and I got zilch, just a few religious channels. Worse the antenna is not stable so I had to perch it where I would not even come close, in order not to hit and and have it fall down. If you live near TV towers or transmitters, buy it, but if you are at all away from a big metropolitan area, save your money, and buy DVDs instead. I for one refuse to watch commercials on TV, so I am limited to premium movie channels on cable. The cable I have is so poor in good movies, that I am better off buying DVD's or renting them. I thought I might have liked to try my new TV with off the air signals, but it was a disaster......."
3,do not meet my expectation,The antenna does not standing solid.Antenna @ 99C store do the same work.do not waste your money
1,A little more information please,"I have read many of the reviews, and I assume this product works well. But my main gripe here is with amazon and the manufacturer. This product is an amplified antenna, and most amplified antennas require an external power source. However, this product was not advertised as needing an ac adapter, and was even advertised as receiving its power for their amplification through the coaxial cable. While most people who buy this product will not care whether or not they have to plug it in, I bought this antenna specifically because it was the highest rated non-powered antenna. However, this antenna REQUIRES TO BE PLUGGED IN TO WORK PROPERLY. In addition, they boast that this antenna has a ""small footprint."" This is the third antenna I have purchased, and it was by far the biggest. It is definitely more interesting looking than most. But being aesthetically pleasing does not somehow make it smaller."
5,Terk indoor antenna,"Tried to stand this antenna up, but if you extend one of the antenna rods, it will fall over to one side. It fell over and to my surprise, it works better laying on its side. Put it on a lazy susan and am thrilled with it. Would recommend this antenna to all."
4,Gets me my Digital TV,About my situation: I live about 12 miles west of most of the broadcast antennae for Digital TV in the DC area. Wanted an antenna that would get me access to most DTV stations without a lot of fuss. I have a coax cable run in my house that permits me to put the antenna on the top floor and connect it to my TV on the main floor.--I tried theTerk Low-Profile Indoor Antenna (TV5)which did not provide a significant improvement over the portable telescoping stub antenna that came with my WinTV Tuner. This one allows me to receive most of the stations in DC with a bit of spotty reception on only one station. It's a keeper.
3,Not an improvement for me,"I read some nice reviews of this antenna for OTA digital TV reception so bought one to try it out. I compared it to my present, amplified, Phillips antenna in the same location indoors. I found I still could not pick up weak stations that the phillips could tune, so I returned it. It seems to work well on most of the closer stations however and its usefulness like all antennas likely depends more on your location that the antenna design so I think you just need to buy it and try it yourself. I think it would be nice if the amplification could be user adjusted from low gain to high like the Phillips. That's why I believe the Phillips could bring in a station or two that the terk could not. Its fixed gain was too low (Phillips has about a 40 dB maximum gain)"
5,Very good reception compare to others I have tried,This antenna has very good reception but not excellent... But compare to others I have tried this is one of the all-around best. Must have for NYC area - I get over 40 channels except one that I really was hopping to have... I guess I can't have every thingI am cutting loose my cable and stick with this HD antenna and my HTPC for Hulu :)
1,Too much HYPE!,"We were forced to buy an antenna. We live about 28 miles from the broadcast towers and this thing is no better than the old rabbit ears we had. Technology really stinks sometimes! We attempt to purchase quality products, this seems to be the best deal around and the price blows the doors off the big box stores! Good Luck!"
5,great reception in Phoenix,Never thought it would work. Plugged it in... reprogrammed TV and got 17 stations --- 6 in HD as clear as a bell. It is for a second home so I won't pay for cable. I was going to be happy to get 2.... I am thrilled with it. Family said it would never work.
3,overpriced,"I tested 4 indoor antennas for Off-Air HD signals. This Terk had the 2nd strongest signals, so I can't say it's all bad, but the RCA 111 which cost me $5 received more signals and had stronger signals than the RCA 525 and the two Terks I tested. I'm about 15 miles from the closest station here in CT and have a small mountain between me and that signal. The next closest tower is almost 20 miles and that signal is even stronger. I couldn't get signals from Springfield, MA (30-35 miles) even with the Terk and a signal booster. For me, it's a no brainer. RCA 111 is doing the job for 1/8 the cost."
4,"Works great, had assembly problem, confusing description","Overall I am very happy with it. Reception is much better than I expected, considering that I am in a shadow and both analog and digital signals are very weak where I am.There are two reasons why I am not giving it a perfect 5:1) Inserting the ""antler piece"" into the base was not a snap. The fit was very tight. I thought I had assembled the piece properly, but it was not working. I was about the send the unit back. However, my reception problem looked too much like it was caused by a poor contact somewhere. After eliminating all other places where that could happen I pushed really hard on the ""antler piece"" and it finally got all the way in.2) The description of the product was confusing. It stated something about vertical positioning of the antenna, which I would prefer and which I expected. I still cannot figure out what they meant. The only way you can position the antenna on the stand is horizontally, like it is shown in the picture."
1,Terrible reception,"I bought this one after reading all the great reviews. MISTAKE. I currently have a cheap RCA ANT-301 indoor amplified UHF/VHF that I wanted to replace. The RCA pulls in 26 channels and I live less than 5 miles from the station antenna's and it's a crystal clear signal 90% of the time (wind does affect it). I got the Terk and was shocked at how HUGE it was (like 2 ft antenna that protrudes out vertically). So I thought wow it's gigantic so it should work awesome. WRONG. I placed it in the exact same spot as the RCA, plugged it in, followed the directions (three times) inot my brand new SONY XBR LCD... and 2 stations.. yup only two came in. I tried repeatedly. Then moved it to the living room and tried the same thing. All in all it didn't work. I returned it the same day and went back to the RCA."
4,As expected,"Got what I expected and I am very pleased with this Antenna. Nevertheless, its ""temper"" varies along with the weather's behavior, meaning that if weather is tough, its signal won't be as good; if weather is nice and calmed, its signal will be great. Long story short: Great purchase for its money!"
2,Two channels,I live about 29 miles from a sizable city but I can only receive two channels with this thing. I've tried it in every room and after much moving and standing holding the antenna I was able to get a third station but I don't want to stand in the middle of the room on my head to watch tv so I haven't been able to get that station back. I wouldn't make this purchase again.
1,Reception Range is Not as Advertised,"I live in the city limits of San Diego which is well within the products alleged range. However, we manage to receive a grand total of 1 tv station. This was not what I thought I was receiving when I purchased the item. The short coaxial cable does not allow for much maneuvering in an effort to pick up more channels. I can't recommend that anybody purchase this antenna."
2,No better than 10 year old loop antenna,"I was hoping the HDTVa would be an upgrade to my 10 year old RCA antenna, but unfortunately it was not. I live about 5-10 miles from the transmitters in my area. The HDTVa was worse than the old antenna without the required AC adapter plugged in, and about the same with it. This antenna requires an AC adapter, which was not clear to me in the product description. This antenna is fine if you like the appearance and do not already own an old antenna, but it is no replacement for a roof or attic mount unit."
3,I get 2 digital channels now,"I read Amazon reviews before I bought this antenna. It seemed like others were getting at least a dozen channels with this antenna. With this indoor antenna, now I get 1 major network channel and 1 obscure channel that broadcasts a lot of documentaries. The signal for those two channels are okay, hitting almost maximum signal rate. It's possible that I could get more channels if I install this antenna up in the attic or on top of the roof, but because this is an indoor antenna, I just set this up on top of my TV. It's also possible that I am not getting a dozen channels like others because I live next to tall buildings and my house has a high vaulted ceiling. Otherwise, it's alright."
3,Not bad for the money,Had a hard time tuning in some UHF channels in one room. Ended up swapping it out for another unit from another company. Worked better in the other room. Difficult to tune channel transmitter towers are about 12 miles away.
3,Same problems as the one I replaced.,"I am 7 miles from the local station and still have lost reception even in good weather, if its cloudy I dont even bother."
4,kitchen HDTV antenna,"I bought this antenna specifically for the 19"" kitchen hdtv and it works great... we located it on top of the kitchen cabinets and have room to spread out the vhf antenna telescoping rods without causing a problem with kitchen functions. It is a supplement to our DirecTv signal which has no local channels in our area. We now can watch network tv in HD which includes a lot of our favorite programs...sure is nice... I sometimes wish I had hooked it up to the big screen in the living room.. I might just buy another one.. Don't know why they charged me $7.50 shipping on a $37.49 item. I thought that should have been free."
2,No better than my 99 cent antenna,This antenna looks modern but it does not work great. Cord is not long and needs to be directed at a specific location.
1,Works poorly and takes up space,This antenna could not reliably tune into two major local stations. I live pretty close the center of my DMA. I ended up replacing this with the round Phillips antenna on clearance that I found at a discount store for $5. That antenna took up less space and got all the local stations.
2,Look elsewhere - hd drops signal all the time,"this antenae sucks - the signal drops constantly and when it rains you don't get a signal. I am very disappointed with its ability to maintain a signal when watching the same channel. I have direct tv satelite and apparently they don't have local channels in HD - cable had it - direct tv does not (live in Louisville KY). we were forced to get an ugly indoor antenae, i read the reviews on this one - most were positive. We have had it for several months now and am looking for something better!"
4,"Reception decent for analog, great for digital","Analog Mode:The product works very well so far with analog channels here in East Austin, excluding the local PBS station, which is often fuzzy. The attached VHF antennas pick up the lone VHF channel without having to be fully extended.Digital:Adding a digital converter box has only confirmed that I am never going back to cable/satellite. We do see a rare disruption, otherwise the reception is outstanding."
4,Works well for Asus B50A laptop,"Works well for Asus B50A laptop. Connection mechanism is a bit bothersome as you simply push the laptop down until it clicks in place. This is done in a manner which causes fear that you will break the laptop - it is surprisingly unrefined. Other than that, the unit works very well."
5,Great books!,These books are a great deal for hours of fun! My little guys looks at the pictures over and over and doesn't ever seem to get tired of hearing the names of all the pictures. These books have been great for his vocabulary as he tries to say all the words too!
3,Great & Awesome book BUT.........,"My son loves this book to no end!!! However, I was disturbed to see advertising for cigarettes on one of the trains pictured. I just don't think that is appropriate for a children's book to have that and would have preferred either that picture being left out or finding another train w/o that advertising on it."
4,Your little train lover will love this book!,Wow! I had no idea some of these trains existed! My two year old son is train obsessed so we had to get him this book. He loves it of course.Great size and very durable. I am giving it only four stars as I agree that the cigarette ad on one of the trains is out of place in a children's book. The ad is very noticable. With all of the photos in this book they could have left this one out.
4,The usual ...,"The story is a run of the mill extra-marital affair. Stunningly beautiful Zoe (Barbara Mori) is married to a wealthy businessman and they suffer from a bored marriage. The vulnerable Zoe falls for her husband's younger (playboyish) brother who is an abstract painter/artist and they enter into a short-lived promiscuous relationship. However, very soon Zoe gets pregnant and her promiscuous lover suddenly loses interest and calls for an abortion. Zoe's husband (who has inclinations towards being gay) redeems the ailing relationship by accepting the yet unborn kid as his own.Nothing special about the movie, except for the stunning presence of Barbara Mori. If you remove her from the movie, then the rating drops to a single star."
3,overall... good,story.. might be found in real life maybe not so drastic but it definetely might be found.. some sex in it..
2,Just for decoration,I bought one of these for a friend from another dealer and the blade broke off the day we got it from hitting CARDBOARD boxes (the head appears to be glued on). It's not good for anything other than hanging on your wall.
4,Better than expected...,"At first I was not interested in reading this book, but after reading the first couple pages, I couldn't put it down. This was my kind of book! The book was full of drama...reminded me of Teri Wood's True to the Game...only, it came up a little short. On the bright side, there's a part 2 coming out...and I'm definitely going to get it just to see what happens. I never thought I'd like reading this...but I must say, it may be one of my favorites!"
3,NOT THAT BAD,THIS BOOK IS NOT THAT BADTHE BOOK IS KIND OF LIKETHUGS AND THE WOMEN WHO DATE THEMCAUSE IT IS ABOUT THREE FRINDSWHO DATE MEN IN THE STREET GAMETHE THREE FRIENDS ALSO STAB EACH OTHERIN THE BACK FOR SOME CRAZY REASONSTHE BOOK IS NOT A MUST BUYIT IS A BOOK TO BORROW WHEN YOUR OUT OF BOOKS
2,Not One of the Best Books,"this book was o-kay. i was left wanting more at the end which is expected since there is a sequel to the book. there seemed to be too many characters in this story making it somewhat difficult to follow the story. not an extremely memorable book, but it was an okay read."
3,So this is what you call being Sheisty.,"To keep it simple..I will say that this was a decent read and it kept me on the edge of my seat.The drama was so crazy that you had to know what happened next even if it kept you reading throughout the night! I do agree with some of the reviewers who stated that the book lacked character development..That part is true.It was also alot of characters mentioned..but it wasnt to the point that you couldnt keep up with who was who.I gave it 3 stars because of how it ended.I know there is a sequel which I am about to read in a few,But the ending to Sheisty could have been way better."
4,The title tells it all,Everyone's life is complicated in some way. You would think Kiesha's got it good. But what makes her better then the other two. Why? Cause her man go out and make the dirty money for her. NO! And it looks like she got a little wild side to her also. So for the ladies out there quick to think your friend has it so good. Take a look at the fine print. Cause when the cops come kickin in the door. She goin out right with him.
4,Sheisty,The book was a page turner it had me wanting to know what was going to happen next. I finished reading the book in one day.
2,"Built for Identifying, Poor for Dealing With","If you are thinking of leaving an abusive spouse, this book may help you. The latter section, ""Dealing With,"" is a short 'book report' based on a few sources. It doesn't read well, and it doesn't present much information. The first section, 'Identify,' wastes a lot of paper, presenting one idea on each page. It is reminiscent of ""you know you're a redneck if..."". Many are redundant; the last several are lame. There is a solid use for this information, but I believe it was presented poorly. The title is also misleading. ""Toxic People"" is too broad a category. These are ways to identify Abusers: those who are either (or both) physically and mentally abusive of others. I'm sure it will help some people, but it wasn't what I was looking for at all."
5,Amazon book,"Great book. Suggest that anyone involved with a narcissist read over this. Toxic people are everywhere, even with your own kids, parents, siblings, etc. There are plenty of 'awe yes' moments in this book, well done. EAsy read. It's not a clinical book, but it does give you ways to deal with these types of people who are everywhere. There is even a little bit of this in each of us, so if you find yourself in here, you can help manager yourself too!"
1,The author's photo on the back gives an idea of quality,"Just look at the author's photo on the back before you buy. Looks like a headshot for a pornographic entertainer. Her nom de plume is also a stripper name -- ""Amorah""? Too close to Amoral. She's wearing shades -- can't see her eyes, which doesn't engender trust with the observer. Cheap cleavage shot. Ugh. Obviously she doesn't want to be taken seriously. Or she's laughing at people for buying the book when she's one of the toxic people she writes about. As for the material, it's generalized. I thought it would be helpful for workplace situations, but it's just the same old garbage of ""Don't let anyone disrespect you."" Full of quotes from other people. Returned it. Perhaps it would be good for teens (sans photo, please), but probably too general even for that."
1,This book did not help me at all !,"This book is a waste of money, so please do not buy it. I payed full price and was not satisfied. It gave me a bunch of false information and was difficult to understand. So therefore I demanded a refund and did not get it. So,im just giving you some helpful advice not to buy it!"
3,disappointing.....,"This guide is totally different from the game, like in the part where you fight galak it said ""shoot the gold conductors on each shield conduit before using your lightsaber to blast the conduit"". But in the game ITS A RED CONDUIT NOT GOLD!!The author didnt cover all of the multiplayer maps, he left out a few like the yavin final duel and hanger duel.And after looking at the cheats page, it gets even better, all those cheats there are a fake that do not work in the full version. That means the author only played and wrote the book with the BETA version of this game.I would advise everyone do not buy this book!"
4,Great detailing,I bought the stand for my son's dragon katana and it works beautifully. The detailing on the piece is outstanding. It could use a little more weight in the base for balance when in use.
1,Steer clear of this one!,"This book was appalling - over-dramatic, unrealistic and full of anachronisms. I'm amazed that other readers have recommended it. The hero is a violent, emotionally abusive, uni-dimensional nutcase; the heroine is an idiotic sap and the plot line demands more than a little ""suspended disbelief"". I was rooting for the horse!"
1,Hello Kitty takes frequent leaks,"We love the idea. And my daughter loves the bed too, but it leaks air and I can not find a replacement air mattress."
2,Nice attempt,"Tom Mast has written this book as a basic primer for the layperson. This book, however, is overly simplified and is slightly dated. A revision is in order. New sections need to be updated on cellulosic ethanol, the public's cultural bias such as ""not a windmill farm / solar panel farm in my neighborhood""Nice attempt to distill a highly complicated topic for the general public, but it needs to be updated."
3,"A decent collection, but buyer beware....","If you are looking for Louis and Ella singing ""Baby, It's Cold Outside,"" this collection does NOT contain that duet. There is an * next to that title and the notation ""*Sarah Vaughan."" However, to me the woman singing does sound like Ella, but the man is definitely NOT Louis (I don't know who it is, but it's not Louis!) The other songs are great, of course, but there are no liner notes of any kind. I would suggest finding one of the Verve recordings with the same songs...at least that way you can get some information about when they were recorded, etc."
2,Great technical quality but does not inspire,"This movie just did not live up to what might have been expected from a well packaged Blu-ray product from Criterion. I mean they usually only bother with bringing back to life noteable movies in pristine quality.Technical quality great, but what may have made sense if had been a well written novel just did not come across as a movie.It has a lot of holes and just does not flow as the continuity from event to event jumps around all over the place. A couple of totally unrealistic happenings like the jump through the closed train window, also spoils what could have been a good movie with a bit more thought to having it more believable, yes, even for a movie."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is basically and introduction for kids to Pilates. No real workout is on the DVD and my son found it so boring, all this DVD is doing is collecting dust on the shelf! Big waste!"
1,Machine hangs - Doesn't work for me,"I have an external hard disk uses 12V to transfer data. When I connected this external hard disk to my laptop, it works. Reason is laptop does not have any limit in the maximum volt. However, when I try to connect using this USB 2.0 adapter, it hangs. Reason is, this adapter have maximum 5V support, my external hard disk requires 12V. Because of this conflict, my machine hangs. Even though, the product description says it is ideal for harddisk, CD-RW etc, it is not true. Make sure your external storage does not exceed 5V, if it does, then this product is not for you."
1,Yikes!!!,"Based on other reviews I thought this card was worth a try... unfortunately, not true. Driver CD doesn't follow addonics own naming conventions; drivers wouldn't load automatically. Once loaded, device would only work as USB 1.1.Technical support call provided no assistance in diagnosing problems - they could neither figure out what was or wasn't working and were not interested in details about my configuration of hardware, OS, and drivers for future use or reference.Go somewhere else for a 2.0 port!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I purchased the Addonics CardBus USB 2.0 Adapter thinking that it would be a fast and inexpensive solution to my USB port problem on my laptop. I was aware of the fact that a power adapter would be needed at times. I thought it would be necessary for powered devices such as a scanner or a printer. However, I was not expecting to have to use the adapter to read flash drives. Both of my flash drives are high-speed 2.0 devices. Maybe that contributed to its inability to read the drives without the adapter. Nevertheless this product was a major disappointment and inconvenience! I would not recommend it."
4,It fits,"Many of the USB 2.0 adapters I tried were simply too large. by large, I mean they were thicke at the USB connector end. this was usually because they jammed Firewire and lots of USB connectors in. with only two on this, it was thin enough to fit the casing of my Gateway Profile."
3,SW: Rogue Planet is OK.,"Rogue Planet has some really good points and some pretty bad ones, as well.Good:1. The relationship of Anakin and Obi-Wan.2. The introduction of Tarkin.3. Anakin's struggles with the Dark Side.4. The supporting characters, like Mace Windu.Bad:1. The story of a planet the grows ships.2. The lack of closure to the Vergere storyline.3. Ke Daiv, a really boring villin.I like the aspects of this book that didn't relate to the specific plot (i.e. the journey to Zonama Sekot), such as the development of Anakin as a Jedi and his life in the Jedi Temple. Also of interest is the struggles Anakin goes through. These are the books strong points."
4,Rouge Planet,"Rouge Planet was, like most STAR WARS books pretty good, but what I think it was missing some good action. I of course enjoyed reading the book, because I loved the way the author fore shadowed the events that are to come later in the STAR WARS saga. It introduces some familiar characters, which was pretty exciting to see, and potrayed their personality appropriately. What most fascanated me, was how the author so neatly blended in the story with another book which takes place decades in the future of STAR WARS universe. I would highly recommend this book for any interested STAR WARS fan."
3,Average to dull,"OK, I am a pretty avid Star Wars fan, but this book just didn't seem to keep me going. The plot seems to drag on and on and on and on and on... well, you get the picture. Obi-wan was developed fairly well, but the rest of the characters left something to be desired. I'd agree that, unless you are a pretty die-hard Star Wars fan, this book probably won't be for you. If you are, it's a decent read."
4,I agree with saberchick,this book is good ill give you that but has this author read the jedi apprentice books and or the episode I novel! this just isnt Obi-Wan at all hes so dull in this book there is no adventurous spirit at all plus hes so focused in on Anikin that you barely get any of his feelings on anything else! i was dissapointed in that one aspect everything and everyone else was wounderfully portrayed and Anikin was unbelievebly well done and the story was great but lets put some UMPH! into the Obi-Wan charicterps im only 13 and im dislexic so im sorry for and misspellings or type-os
2,Kind of boring.,"I wasn't looking for anything that'll be life-changing for Anakin or Obi-Wan, but I was looking for something adventerous. Mainly, this book just gives details and descriptions of a ship building process of ship-building planet.There are s few bones thrown in if you're a fan of the New Jedi Order series of books. It gives some insight into the past Tarkin had. Also, find out the origins of the Death Star. All in all though, nothing too important.Not a very exciting book by any stretch of the imagination. If you have some afternoons to kill, it's not a bad read. Just not a terribly exciting one."
1,How Could Anybody Like This Book?,"This is the worst Star Wars novel I have read yet. The relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan was poorly displayed, as the author made Obi-Wan a meidocre, inexperienced, weak Jedi. The dark side of Anakin is too obvious. Tarkin is not even interesting. The storyline was boring and confusing, with very little action. In all, the book had weak dialogue, poor character development, and a weak plot. Would not recommend this book to anybody to read...hey, I was on a plane from California, and the ride felt longer reading this bad book. For anyone dying to read it, wait for the paperback."
2,A weak effort,"A wayward planet at the edge to nowwhere. Granted, the book is well written, but too far outside of the star wars genre for my tastes.Don't read this unless you've read every other Star Wars novel first."
2,Leave it to Lucas!,"Unlike the Jedi Apprentice series, I think this story should have been left to the better minds of G. Lucas and such. I don't think the story of Anikan and Obi-Wan could be prortrayed as well."
2,Science fiction hiding in Star Wars clothing,"I must say that this book was a disappointment to me. The story wasn't bad, and Greg Bear is an above average sci-fi writer. But take out the words Jedi Knight and change the main characters' names and you will see the book has little to do with the Star Wars universe and the characters who populate it. If anything, Bear writing seems contained because he is trying to make it fit into the Star Wars mold.Not bad sci-fi, but not a good Star Wars tale."
4,A beautifully character-driven adventure,"If you're looking for those incredible, devious plot twists a la Zahn and Thrawn, look somewhere else. But if you're looking for a great punch in the gut, this is for you! Timothy Zahn aside, this may be the best Star Wars novel since the original trilogy. Not since Return of the Jedi have the characters lived--really lived, not simply acted out the plot.The adventure is lived on two planes: the physical, and the spiritual. Anakin is an adolescent recognizing that he's more than your average Padawan. Obi-wan is a rigid, tradition-bound master, not truly comfortable with himself or his apprentice, who sometimes frightens him. By the end of the book, Anakin has had a terrifying glimpse into his future, and Obi-wan has found the love inherent in being a teacher and true Master. Hayden! Ewan! Read this book!!"
3,CD/DVD player,"It's a fine product, and does what its supposed to do. However, MAC users take heed: it only works with PCs."
3,"Still funny, but just aiming for the minimal effect?","I love this show and I have all the released seasons on DVD. It still is very entertaining for the most part, although there are actually some episodes I yawned at----and that is a RARE thing with Roseanne. And what is up with all those Beckys? Pick the girl that does the better job, and STICK WITH HER. lol It is soo confusing! Very good comedic timing with all the actors, although not nearly as good as prior seasons....and there are some personal favorite episodes, such as ""Another Mouth to Shut Up"" and ""Shower the People You Love With Stuff""....""Springtime For David"" is also very, very good. Still, they could have all done better. The writing is going downhill, too, although not quite as bad as in the ninth season, when Jackie starts dating a prince ( COME ON. ) The worst season I think, but still satisfactory overall."
2,Painful to watch.,"Roseanne - Season 8 is so horrible, dreadful, and painful to watch. Roseanne was such a funny woman but she lost her spark and somehow her acting took a dive as well. The only good episode is when Darlene and David get married and Dan suffers a heart attack. Season 8 and 9 are so stupid and pointless, I highly recommend seasons 1-7 instead, that's when this show was pure magic."
3,"Fun book, ending was a bit anti-climatic.","This was a fun fantasy warfare book from Mr. Abnett which tracks the divergent lives of 2 cousins after a military defeat in which they are separated, and the sequence of events which was obviously going to bring them into conflict.I think either of the subject's stories would have been a good standalone novel's basis, as the inevitable confrontation between the two seemed like a lot of effort to get nowhere. The scenery and background/settings were very well written, along with the individual threads of the 2 stories.I prefer Mr. Abnett's eisenhorn trilogy to this."
1,Revisionist history at its finest,"If you enjoy reading what could have been as to what really happened through the lens of modern times please read this book. If ""jawboning"" issues in the light of political correctness is for you...read the book! If one is interested in scholarly history; however, don't waste your time."
5,Amazing,"Karinjit Siyan's approach to teaching is amazing. I have read alot of TCP/IP with NT book, but none are as good. If you truly want to learn about NT and TCP/IP, this is the book."
3,The wrist band of poor quality.,I gave it to my wife and few months later I'm looking again for another watch to buy.The wrist band turned yellowish and came off the center part. The watch still work fine but as a pocket watch.
2,broke after 6 months,"just like a bunch of other people wrote here - the thing broke after 6 months of light usage. It's not a bad router, but kinda flaky - kept rebooting it at least 3-5 times a week under light usage (playing games and browsing web mostly). Beta bios upgrades are numerous, but very few of them worked well - although I don't mind it that much, since flashing its bios is a breeze.I think this router is very sensitive to power fluctuations. I'll put the Netgear's replacement router on my UPS - hopefully it'll get more stable and won't break again.Gosh! this thing generates a ton of heat just sitting there, doing nothing!"
5,"Hands down, best box around","I have this product already, and setting up my second network with the same deal. Set up on the first one took a while, but I figured it out with the online documentation. I used to be a LAN Administrator so I know my way around a bit. Only product that I have found that has hard wire, wireless and print server all in one. The only problem I have is the range - I can't go as far as I had hoped on the wireless, I have to stay near the router. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,Not Recommended,"I've had two of these units over the last 3 months. When they work, they work great. The feature set is nice, the wireless connection is strong throughout my house and the print server is a nice option. The problem is that the first one I own died after 3 weeks. I was able to return it to the store where I bought it because it was within the 30 day limit. The second unit died after 6 weeks. I spoke with Netgear tech support and they informed me that since it worked for 6 weeks that the issue was not due to manufactures defect and therefore was not covered under warranty. I spoke with 2 supervisors and they both seemed completely indifferent to the idea that their products may have an issue.It's a nice piece of equipment when it works, but I wouldn't take the gamble of buying one again."
2,Great Concept. Poor Execution,"As a fisherman and someone who lives near the setting of this book, I loved the subject and the concept (I particularly liked the recipes at the end of each chapter). But I found it very difficult to read because the voice of the Fisherman was too pedantic and preachy. The Fisherman came off as a bag of wind rather than someone to be admired. Eventhough I didn't expect the dialogue between the Fisherman and the Stranger to be a natural everyday conversation, it exceeded even my expectations in how awkward it all sounded."
1,Rushed to press,"I got a kick out of the reviews for this book. It averages 5 stars, then one star, back and forth. I have read my fair share of VB books, and taken several of the VB 5 and 6 tests. Don't kid yourself the VB 6 tests are tough, but not impossible. However the amount of mistakes and information that this book does not cover makes this book not worth the money in my opinion."
3,"Nice try, but a bit sloppy","I have read the book from cover to cover, and am aiming for VB6 certification in both desktop and distributed subject areas. I did all the exercises and quite a few of the ""check it out"" sections.All in all I think the approach is a good one - you learn by doing. But, as usual with certification guides, it looks to have been rushed and contains some careless errors and lots of typos (especially in later chapters...!)The authors really go off the deep end in chapter 21, taking us through how to create a VB add-in, whereas the chapter is supposed to discuss using the visual component manager (a required study area for the desktop cert. exam).The answers for Chapter 13 were completely wrong.This book gives you something to work with, but I feel that it will need to be supplemented.To all those people who are flaming this book - how about suggesting a better alternative if you've found one?Thanks,-Lou"
3,Doesn't cover everything needed to pass the exam,"I found this book to be a good reference for all of the new technologies in VB6, but it did not cover some major points that were on the exam.Missing concepts:- application deployment (local/network)- extensive detail on watch expressions- SourceSafeThese missing details may be found in books for the VB6 distributed applications exam, but are not found in this book."
1,"Nope, sorry this book is not what they claim it is....","Here it is, short, sweet and simple. The book claims on it's cover ""Everything you need to pass Microsoft's Visual Basic 6. Certification Exam"" Ok, why then does it not include anything on the ""treeview"" or ""Listview"" control, which according to Microsoft's website is on their VB 6 test (70-176). I could go on, but I think you get the point."
2,There are better books for less,"Just completed reading the book. Besides the many errors (typos, wrong answers, etc.), my biggest gripe as that important areas are discussed about VB but the information provided rarely went beyond the scope of information already found in MSDN and the VB help files! What a disappointment! The only chapter I found informative was Chap 12 on ADO. If you are a beginner, this is a good book, but there are other resources out there that are more cost-effective. If you are an experienced developer, keep looking!"
1,Waste of Money,"This was one of the first study guides around for this exam and it shows. It has all the hallmarks of having been rushed into print. It is riddled with typos but worse still is the information which is just plain wrong. Sometimes it is obviously wrong but sometimes you can spend hours working out the truth. Furthermore, the authors do not seem to know at what level to pitch this book: in some places they make a meal out of drumming in some point which is blatantly obvious and in others they glibly skim over a topic leaving the reader to attempt to infer their meaning. Get Hawhee's book from New Riders (ISBN 0-7357-0002-8): it is not perfect but it is miles better than this."
4,Fun CD!,"This CD brings me back strait to the 80s, I really enjoy the variety of songs on this album. I definitely recommend it!"
4,NAYAS: Innovative and Only Getting Better,"NAYAS is a unique Latin Rock band. Their music is really new to the ear, their lyrics are solid and go straight to the heart, and this band will only get even better as they continue making music. I am looking forward to not only their next album but also the ones that they make over the next 20 years!"
1,Don't buy it !!!,"This glider is cheaply done and very poor quality. It is not comfortable and will hurt your back. Don't buy it !! Buy the $80 Wal Mart glider instead, it is much better. I am so disappointed by this product and I regret spending so much for this piece of junk !"
2,Great Product,I use a lot of thread locker and really love it but these bottles are ridiculously large for the quantity of locker that is in it. These bottles are miss leading and should be full not nearly empty on purchase.
4,A Pretty Fun Game,This game is pretty fun. It a real treat. It's something diffrent. I enjoyed playing it. It was cool.
2,Not for True Bone Fans,"There are a couple of old Bone hits on this CD, but if you're a true Bone fan looking to get back in the Bone groove, it's a better idea to just re-purchase Creepin on a Come Up and/or E1999. Dont get me wrong, there are some hits on this CD, but it's missing a LOT of other Bone Hits. Disc 1 is cool, but Disc 2 is full of Bone songs I had never even heard of which are NOT hits. Seems like they were trying to sneak some newer Bone in with the old school stuff."
1,"michael buble,60 minutes","I bought this item for my wife,a massive Buble fan,assuming it would keep her happy for an hour.WRONG...It has been condensed down to approximately 15 minutes running time,and consequently I consider it a massive rip off by the manufacturers.I do not blame Amazon for this as they did not produce it."
3,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","(Shaolin Vs. Ninja),,,Not a bad flick,,but I though the story became too confusing. It's almost seemed like they threw a bunch a great kung fu fighters into a ring and say fight for no apparent reason. The fight scenes are amazing and a very entertaining movie to watch,,especially only for the fights!! I gave this flick a 3 star for a good effort!!"
1,Extremely Unsatisfied,This product is very difficult to use It is not user friendly I finally gave up when I could not get pictures loaded I would not recommend buying it even if you are very computer literate
2,used,the pliers were used and i knew this prior to ordering but it stated that they were in good shape. Wrong they were rusted badly and all the parts were losse the pliers them selfs were bent if you sell somthing used please be honest on the shape of somthing i dont think ill even use them. That said i spent a little more for a new pair and thats what i should have done in the first place from now on i will never buy a used item again
3,A Neat Product To Carry Your Zen Stone.,"A good quality product. It has an elastic band which can be adjusted to larger size arms. The neoprene skin protects the player from being scratched. The arm band allows a user to carry their Zen Stone MP3 player comfortably while doing other tasks. Since the Zen Stone does not have a clip attached like most other MP3 players. The only drawback to this product, is that you cannot see the flashing power light on your Zen Stone to tell you if the player is on or off. Also, you cannot tell how much battery life you have left because you cannot see the flashing power light when this product is used."
1,Waste of money,"Waste of money. Zero software updates available. You will only be able to use this for one transfer. Tech support extremely slow, informed me that many new packages are out of date and unsupported.Save your money. Avoid Detto. Recommend Seagate or Maxtor external hard drive. They will allow continued benefit by transferring your files and acting as a security back up."
1,Dissapointed,"I am a huge Dave Gilmour fan but I have never been so disappointed with a Bluray as I am with this one. The video quality is unbelievably poor and Sony should be ashamed that they did not capture this concert properly and the moment is now lost for ever. Do not waste your money getting this on Bluray, just get the DVD.I am so disappointed that I cannot bring myself to watch it right now."
5,Five Stars is not enough,"David Gilmour may be one of the most underrated musicians of the past few generations. This work, which in my opinion is complimentary to the 'Live in Gdansk"" DVD, highlights ""On an Island"", which I have found to be one of the better CD's from the past ten years. Yes, I am biased as I was weaned on Pink Floyd, but listen to the On an Island set and you will find a very introspective set of songs. Of course, the classic Pink Floyd songs (Dark Side selections, Shine on you crazy diamond, Comfortably Numb) are done in impeccable fashion, and the guests (Crosby, Nash, Bowie) are all fantastic additions to this set.The musicianship is of course beyond reproach, and the video quality is fine contrary to some of the other reviews. Suffice to say if you are a Pink Floyd fan this is a must have. I would highly recommend you also buy Live in Gdansk. I cannot get enough of David's work and only wish I have the opportunity to see him live before it is too late."
5,Awesome!,Well I just returned home from seeing the Northern States DVD showing at the IMAX theater and what an experience. There was even live linked Q&A via satellite with Gilmore and that put the icing on the cake. They even showed us the extras of the band behind the scenes while touring. We are true fans of Gilmore and what a great time they were all having doing this tour. I just ordered my copy of the DVD and can't wait to get it. There was a song that took us by surprise and really stood out and that was Echoes! What a treat that was. Enjoy all of you who purchase it! You wont be disappointed!
2,Live at Gdansk is a much better production.,"Live at Gdansk is a much better production, the eliance on Dark Side of the Moon reflects alack of innovation att for the original PF repertoire"
1,poor,"Is very dissapoint me, because the quality is very poor, its like a VHS Type. I do not recomended."
5,I recommend strongly!,"There is a very big positive energy among the musicians. The vocal of Nash/Crosby, is already worth DVD."
5,Gilmour's best work to date,"David Gilmour's best work to date. This concert was held in a smaller venue as compared to the huge ""PULSE"" concert. In the Royal Albert Hall the accoustics are better and the listener gets more out of the lyrics to the music. Also the two part concert opens with slower, softer part one and then rocks in part two. I have to rate this as a 5 Star concert. Fantastic would be a mild under-statement.Steve"
5,David Gilmour,"Absolutely and without a doubt the very best that I have ever heard , David Gilmour is the best and his special guests were incredible"
1,flat,"twenty days shipping.buy in france send by germany ? but not readable in europe and not specified before sale.the concert is in good sound quality but very ""soft"" and good for snoring before TV screen."
5,Bill Moyers: Wisdom of Faith,"Bill Moyers has never failed to captivate me, and he does so again in this series. He and Huston Smith validate that the world is too big for just one God. A perfect example of blending the best of all faiths."
3,Better than expected yet focused on the wrong aspects.,"Granted I am not as big as an Elvis aficionado as some and I understand that this was licensed by the estate. I do however take issue with the whole ""religious phase"" since Elvis the Gospel years shows it was more than just a phase in his life, but rather a cornerstone foundation of who is was.Not being a fan of Jonathan Rhys Myers at all, I will give him great credit for being Elvis. However the aspects of his life they focused bored me, too many scenes involving his pill dependence and waiting to have sex with Pricilla."
3,DAFFY 1936 COMEDY,"A slightly daffy cinematic item of little importance, LOVE ON THE RUN has clever direction, sophisticated dialogue, novel settings and ludicrous situations. The movie is screen entertainment which is easy to take; just relax and have a good time with it! The plot is a bit improbable, but this is another fast, suave, sophisticated comedy about and heiress and a star reporter. Joan Crawford is amusing as spoiled Sally Parker while Gable does well in his role of Michael Anthony. This is an enjoyable romantic comedy which stars Joan as a rich American heiress and Gable and Tone (Crawford's real-life husband at the time) as journalists stationed in Europe. Gable and Tone are assigned to cover an international aviator, who turns out to be an evil spy, as well as the upcoming wedding of flighty Crawford...A wild and farfetched plot is helped greatly by the star performances; you can see how hard everyone is working to make this a slick, sexy hit."
2,Mini Pathetic Print Server,"Having read the reviews of this product (and seeing little competition) I decided to give the PS101 a try. I have a machine running XP & a Mac with OS X 10.3 so I figured that once the device was setup by the windows machine the Mac would just need the right settings--wrong. The setup on XP was tricky & confusing, but did indeed work. I have a Brother HL-1250 (great printer) that isn't a native OS X printer. I couldn't get the IP Printing settings to take the brother as default. As per another review on this product, Mac printing is possible (theoretically) with the right printer. Be careful with this product..."
1,Quantity Incorrect,"There are not 50 in a pack, only one. Product itself is high quality and very nice. Happy with refund given."
2,Print Server is useless,"The firewall/router portion of the FR114P is great and easy to set up, but the print server is useless! I have a Canon i850 on Windows XP, and it drags the print speed down so low that you want to cry. While printing graphics it literally pauses for a second or two after each pass of the print head. After installing via the recommended method (Netgear's virtual firewall printer port), I found a tidbit of two cryptic sentences on their website that suggested installing the printer via the Windows LDP/LPR port as a remedy for slow printing. This made no difference. Tech support then suggested turning off print buffering on the Windows printer settings. This only made matters worse as it still printed slowy but now also ties up the computer until it's done!I returned the FR114P and will now try the D-Link DI-704UP which has a USB print server. This thing's great if you don't mind paying an extra $40 for print server functionality that you'll never want to use!"
2,"similar to others -- good for a while, but ...","I, like many other reviewers, found the router to work as advertised, mostly. like others, I never was able to get the printserver to work with my Lexmark 3200. But I mainly bought this item for its router/firewall capabilities.as with others, the unit worked fine for nearly 18 months. now, I have to power cycle the thing nearly every time I boot my pc's in order to get an internet connection. and it randomly looses the internet connection with my cable modem. once the internet connection is lost I also loose LAN capability. it's really too bad, I really liked this product. for nearly a year and a half I didn't even think about it much. now it's a big headache. I gave it 2 stars since I liked it when it worked (4 stars) even though the print server didn't work, and now it rates 1 star -- so I took the average. for an $80-$100 product you wold think these things would last more than a year or so."
3,There's got to be a more rigorous unit on the market...,"My first unit was defective. The second unit works well. This firewall works like a charm & has enough configs to make it a great solution. It turns out to be highly suspect to a little bit of extra electricity. Make sure you have it on a top quality surge protector.PS: Kudos to Amazon. After getting an RMA for the first unit from Netgear, Amazon actually shipped me a new one before they got the defective unit back. All at no charge to me (no shipping etc...). That's why we love Amazon."
4,Practical Advice,"This book gives practical and down to earth advice about dating a divorced man. I really enjoyed the book, it helped me to realize where to set my priorities."
2,silent bell,"This was bought to be used as part of a halloween costume. It did not last through half the night. I thought you ""get what you pay for"" was accurate, but bells with no clanger are pretty much junk."
4,This game is WarCraft,"I don't know why any of the other reviewers haven't mentioned it, this game is EXACTLY like WarCraft. But that's OK, because they're both fun games. Warcraft's graphics are better, which is why this game only gets 4 stars."
2,Will not work with Lion OS,This game was a favorite of mine for many years on Microsoft Windows OS. Looked forward to playing it on my Mac. But it will not work on the Lion OS. Very disappointed that this was not on the description of the game when I ordered it and had to return it for a refund.
2,Beware: this is actually a Joo Ricardo solo album.,"When Secos e Molhados split in 1974, founder member Joo Ricardo said: ""I am Secos e Molhados, so the group will go on."" Instead, he began an ill-fated solo career. It was only much later that he decided to bring the group back with different line-ups. None of them recaptured the group's original appeal, though. But his old statement that ""he is"" Secos e Molhados has taken a new meaning since he began to release solo albums under the group's name. This is one of them. It is NOT a greatest hits compilation! And not an album I would recommend very strongly either, except to completists."
3,Small book about small things,"The book is a kind of comic book telling the story about the people behind and the development of the quantum theories. It is entertaining and fun to read. Unfortunately, the size of the book (booklet) and the fonts that are used makes it difficult to read.The content is OK, but the size of the book is not."
4,"Nice shorts, nicer price.","the shorts are very comfortable, fit nicely, and are an extremely good value. Every bit as good as the pair I bought from Travelsmith, but for half the price."
3,it was ok..honestly,Well the best part of this CD i think is the acoustic versions of Grand theft autumn and nobody puts baby in the corner. The DVD is ok as well i suppose. If I had the choice between this and another CD of fallout boys then I would get the other CD but if you have the rest then you should just this anyway.
3,Nice Effort-Not Great,"There's some nice tracks on this album, but the weakest points were coming from the vocal department. It was a good enough effort to buy though."
1,COPY CONTROLLED!!,THIS CD IS COPY CONTROLLED. COPY CONTROLLED TAKES AWAY THE AMERICAN PEOPLES RIGHTS AND PRIVACY. DON'T SUPPORT ARTISTS THAT SUPPORT THIS VIOLATION OF PRIVACY!!!
4,metro map is especially handy,"There are too many great restaurants in DC to even filter down into one book. Otherwise, it was great, especially the neighborhood maps and metro map."
2,"decent guide, but biased left","This is a decent guide book, but there are others just as good. It contains lots of negative comments about the current president that are unneccessary to it's purpose as a city guide. I wouldn't buy it for that reason alone."
3,Not for beginners,"This is a beautiful deck of cards, no question about it. However, it really deviates from the Rider/Waite deck which is what most books are written on. So, if you want to learn the tarot, this is not the deck for you. If you already know the tarot, then this deck will surely impress those who come to you for a reading, especially if they know nothing about the subject.So, as soon as I received this deck along with the book 78 degrees of wisdom by Rachel Pollack, I knew I made a mistake in the selection of my first deck. My only regret in buying this deck was the timing. I am happy to own it, but not learn from it."
3,Beautiful online but...,"When I came across The Golden Tarot, I was immediately drawn to the imagery. As an art lover, I felt an instant connection to the chosen imagery along with the sumptuous colors. I though this dek would be great for me. I placed an order (which shipped and was delivered with impressive speed). Unfortunately, the deck is not what I imagined. The imagery is beautiful but I am not impressed the with quality at all. Certain figures/areas are sharper than others and the gilding flakes off with little handling. This things, to a degree, almost take me out of my readings. A shame since I was so looking forward to this deck."
2,Too many topics,"This book is meant for first or second year major student in physics. I am a second year student myself and I found this book quite frustrating. It covers many topics in modern physics, perhaps too many. The treatment of subject is not thorough enough and especially the real theoretical side is often omitted. The subject is difficult enough by itself and this book is not the greatest source of information."
1,Not what I expected,Not really Flash Cards. It has a few pages in the back that has the condensed information. But the writing is small to use as flash cards. Lots of questions and answers instead. Not as helpful as flash cards would have been.Michelle
2,WRONG SHIPMENT!!!,"I have the same issue on this floor mat, I ordered the front but I received the back mats. I cannot resolved this issue with amazon...ship the right floor mats or refund the price difference!"
3,Not as annovative as Catch-22,It seems that the best way to enjoy this book is to read itbefore reading Catch-22. Thus one can overlook the flaws inthe writing (As compared to Catch-22) as well as some majorflaws in the plot.
1,Closing Time is a difficult to read let-down of a novel.,"I had mixed expectations as to the quality of a sequal to the fabulous book ""Catch-22"" by Joseph Heller. After I read ""Closing Time"" by Heller, my suspicions were confirmed. ""Closing Time"" tries to capture the irony and punch of ""Catch-22"", but fails as a novel written too long after the ""first part."" ""Closing Time"" rambles on and lacks any sort of direction. Sure, ""Closing Time"" has Heller's funny redundant sentences and roundabout conversations, but wasn't that in ""Catch-22?"" It is not apparent at times who is speaking in the book, and it is never apparent why the reader would care about Yossarian and his peers' older life when clearly Yossarian and his fellow veterans ""made their point"" in Catch-22. I believe Heller should have left well enough alone."
1,Ignore the Sub-Title,"It was the sub-title and a review I read (not on Amazon) that intrigued me to want to read this book. The book did not deliver on my expectations. I still walked away at the end saying, ""So what?"" It didn't seem that any particular premise had either been introduced or supported in a way that would make it 'applicable' -- so that you would have dropped the book several times during reading to run off and try a concept or two.The most disappointing was the obvious 'filter' the author makes the reader look through because of his financial background as a CFO. And (someone please correct me on this if you can...I'm open for debate) I was most bothered by a premise that the entire book rested on. Where the concept of the efficiency of free markets was aligned to financial markets, including the stock market! I don't recall that association ever being a valid one when I was in business school."
5,Great!,Great product. Needed a little help with set up and got it from customer service. Great service!
1,Don't Buy,"I had a terrible time with my Netgear RP614v2 router. Matching it with a Motorola Surfboard cable modem and Adephia as the ISP, it would fail on an average of every few days to allow a connection. With help (of all things) D-Link's help papes I figured out what was happening: Adelphia wants to see my computer's MAC address, so I set the router to report the PC's MAC address, not the router's MAC address to Adelphia. This works so long as the router ""remembers"" the PC's MAC address. Trouble is that it loses the information, requiring a lengthy powering down of the cable modem and then the router so that the router can read the PC's MAC address and ""spoof"" it to Adelphia.Netgear's online and supplied documentation are so simple-minded as to be useless. I felt much better when I took a sledge hammer to this Cisco POS!Gary Kellison, Carlsbad, California"
3,"not bad, but could be better...","I ordered mine after some exhaustive Internet research on all the other routers in the same price range on the market today.Two weeks later, mine allows me to share cable internet but not share files and printer between our two PCs. In fact there is NOTHING in the otherwise excellent documentation and setup help manual & CD ROM that even touches upon this aspect of the router. Therefore one is left with the unenviable task of trying to figure it out through Windows' [bad] Help files.Methinks the reviewer who said he had this router up and running 3 minutes out of the box must be either: 1. already a techno-geek well versed in the black arts of PC-land, or 2. working for Netgear!Lastly, the included ""Freedom"" Internet Security software is basically useless. You're much better off with Norton's Internet Security or even ZoneAlarm.Sadly though, compared with other similarly priced routers, the RP614NA actually shines!"
2,Not for Xbox users,"This router was a real hassle to install. If you know all about networking and ISPs and all the numbers associated with all your equipment, then you can save 3 bucks and buy this box. I am no techie and found it impossible to install AND, when I was done hassling with the tech-support, it turned out that the Netgear router was not compatible with Xbox Live and the Xbox 360, which is what I bought it for in the first place. Instead, I now have a Linksys BEFSR41 EtherFast Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch. It was a breeze to install, virtually plug-and-play, and it works with the Xbox. The Linksys unit was well worth the extra 3 bucks."
2,Could Not Get RP614NA to Renew IP Address,"Unfortunately, I did not have much luck with this router. It seemed to work fine until the IP address dynamically assigned by the ISP (RoadRunner) expired. The router was being assigned an IP address with a 1 day lease using DHCP. After the lease expired, I would have to re-boot the router.I also could not get the port forwarding to work.These problems could have been user error, but I worked with NG tech support and we could not resolve the issue.I returned it and purchased a Linksys BEFSR41 and it has worked great."
5,Easy as they come.,"I knew nothing about setting up a network in my home. With this router is was a simple as running some wire and making a few easy conections. My only sticking spot was configuring Windows XP to use the network. From what I have read and from what I have seen out of this product, you can't go wrong."
1,Unreliable and Unfixable,"I have tried for the last 5 months to get Netgear to resolve a problem with the RP614 that I have but to no avail. The unit quits working randomly and requires power cycling it to get it to work again. Every response has been inane, either Netgear doesn't have a clue, doesn't know how to find the problem or simply doesn't care. And the problem has nothing to do with loads as it occurs with one computer on the network. I've also run every type of scan of my computer to be sure it is not a virus, etc and my computer is clean so the problem is with the router. I have a very simple system so the problem is not in the configuration. Now Netgear will not even respond to my support request email, they now required me to register and log the case in as new! I strongly suggest going with LinkSys and that is what I am switching to. This has to be one of the worst customer service experiences I've had."
3,Connection Drops,"I tryed this adaptor with multiple PDAs and multiple APs. In all cases, I have experienced sporadic droping of connections. Only fix is to repeatly restart and poweroff my pda. RMAed, hopefully it was just a bad card. It very hard to communicate with Netgears tech support. Very little English speaking reps."
1,No size info - No buy,"I can't purchase this item if you can't provice me with the sizing information. S, M, L, XL means NOTHING. You lost the sale"
5,Fun and Easy,"This product is the best language teacher I have seen yet. The moment I turn the program on, it just unloads massive amount of information. Plus its user friendly and fun to use, it makes learning a new language fun and desirable. (Hence the name A+ Italian) I recommend buying this program if you have ever had the desire to learn a new langauge at all, you wont regret it. And I recommend buying it from Amazon they have the best prices, they offer very aggressive pricing for quality products and I wouldnt go anywhere else. I also recommend the A+ French program as well."
2,Haven't finished but it's a bust..,It's far harder to play this one compared to prince of persia the sands of time even with a walkthrough I will be scratching my head (and that's the video one that gives you step by step tutorials)this story wasn't to my liking I'm sure some like these type of in depth games if you like a very hard game buy it..otherwise don't.
4,The Prince is back... with attitude!,"The second installment of the Prince of Persia series was a fantastic ride through a dark world of time-travel and Middle-Eastern design and architecture. If you loved the 'Arabian Nights storybook' feel of the first game, I'm sorry but that is gone and replaced by a darker, more mature feel that mixes in combat and an industrial rock soundtrack on top of the already existing puzzles. The fighting system was seriously overhauled in this version, allowing for much more creative fighting. If you liked the first one, you MAY like this one. It may be for the older crowd, but hey! We like puzzle games too!"
2,"So far, not so good",I am having trouble getting both computers to work without having to unplug my modem each time. There were no instructions and no disc. I emailed the company but they have yet to respond.
3,Slow throughput (6 Mbps) to the internet,We've had this router for a few years now and it's worked like a champ!But we now have 30 Mbps internet service from our cable provider and this Netgear router cannot process the data any faster than 6 Mbps. (probably this is all the firewall can handle.)If you need throughput to/from the Internet that is faster than 6 Mbps buy a more powerful router - as we are about to do.
1,Absolute garbage - zero stars,"I have version 3 of this router, it is horrendously slow:downloading from the internet on my linksys router goes at about 1.2 Mb/s, with this one, it's more like 200 kb/s.Transferring files from computer to computer goes at 1 Mb/s - slower than downloading from the internet with my other router! seriously!?!? It also gets saturated when transferring large files, I can't bring up websites and my voip phone connected to this router starts freaking out until the transfer is done.I had read all the reviews about how slow this thing is and thought that they couldn't possibly be right. It can't be that bad! It's worse, don't buy this thing."
1,Unstable,"Still a beta box, If you get much beyond a basic configuration, this box is not for you. Running the latest firmware (1.2) the box crashed several times and had to be initialized. Netgear's technical support states that this box cannot be used a just a VPN server, it must also be used as the network gateway in order for the VPN's to work. Entirely not acceptable."
5,netgear proves again it's tops,"I hate to buy something and then learn you need to jump through hoops to install it and have it work right. I don't want to spend two months - as I did with another brand, finally to give up and buy a netgear. I bought a cheaper version of netgear's router and loved it. But after nearly two years it just died. Too cheap to fix, so I went to replace. I could have replaced with the same version for about half the price, but I liked the stronger firewalls, the closed ports on this one.I am very computer literate and teach at a computer help ""desk"". I cannot recommend netgear products high enough for their sheer simplicity. Anyone can install a netgear router. They are plug in and virtually go with no problems what so ever.I am very please with 8 ports, instead of the four, love the easy of installing, and am one happy netgear customer - for the second time."
4,Typical Netgear driver frustrations,"Replaced a four-year-old FS314. Wouldn't work with standard drivers on the accompanying disk. Had to download updated driver, go through the setup process 2nd time. Still can't get the web administration feature to work when administrator IP addresses are filtered to a range or single IP. Solid build - as usual, My dissatisfaction with Netgear involves their buggy firmware, and has for years. You know what their Tech Support is like so no need to get beat a long-dead horse."
2,High Latency Avoid,I wanted to like this router but the high latency killed it for me. Perhaps if I had not used a linksys wrt54g and an apple timecapsule on the same internet connection the problem would not have been so annoying but I did and it was. I really wanted a cheap simple VPN this worked with windows but I couldn't get it to work on a mac. Either way it slowed down my internet response to time the point it didn't matter. If you have ever surfed on a satellite connection it created a similar delay. Replacing it with the previous apple and then my retired linksys the problem went away immediately.
1,Gemstones was not a gem,"Normailly I love Barbara Delinsky's books. However, this one seemed trite. Amazing Grace and Three Wishes were awesome books."
2,"Cute, but can't make it!","This song is very cute, I first heard it one the radio (How it got there, I don't know.) Here are the tracks:Track 1: The Hampsterdance Song (Radio Edit) This version is short with no intro like the Extended Version.Track 2: The Hampsterdance Song (Extended Mix) This version sounds like a new song at the beginning, but then it returns to its original tune.This song is okay, but don't waste your money on this one unless you really, really, want to."
1,Buy cheap - Buy Twice,"There's a reason why this product is so cheap. It is extremelly difficult to configure, and tech support are particularly knowledgeable. My first unit had a defect, second was impossible to set up. I switched to a Linksys product which was better but again no way near perfect.Tech support had very long wait times"
1,hilary duff suxs,"OMG after all even though i am 13 i hate her i couldnt even belive she had 2 cds come out her voice totaly suxs u can tell once u listen to her cd its so lame i think i like better lindsay lohan. hilary just acts like a punk she is not, her voice suxs and probably her sisters voice suxs even more i dont like the duff sisters!"
5,Highly readable and very well researched,"I haven't quite read the entire book yet, and I don't have time right now to write a comprehensive review, but I did want to say that this book is a great read and would be appreciated by anyone with the slightest interest in ships. It is also very impressively researched - Fox's in-depth research puts many so-called specialist historians to shame. I am almost ashamed of the fact that I only paid a dollar for a new copy of this book, which is far less than I've paid for many history books that aren't a fraction as entertaining or informative as this one. I see you can still get it for scarcely more than a buck secondhand and it's an absolute steal at that price, and indeed very good value for the hardback even at full price."
1,Solves a problem that doesn't exist,I have a secret I've been using ever since I was a little kid. It's called a tablespoon. It holds things and it spreads things.
4,Time passing.,"Intriguing and informative look at a title (and by extension, an industry) in transition. Clearly illustrates both the reasons for and effects of corporate acquisition of magazines. Mehta's tone of hero worship for Shawn is occasionally grating. In fairness, this may be earned, as the Mr. Shawn in this book has many qualities you'd expect from a quiet hero. Fascinating stuff."
4,Interesting and informative,"RL Fox, who has spent more time researching ancient Western history than have all reviewers (on this site) of his book (combined), presents his views of who were the authors of the Judeo/Christian Bible. Those who believe that the Bible is the the literal Word of God will reject the very idea of the book outright -- in that case, who cares who may have written the Bible, or the social conditions that may have influenced the writing?Others will find this very interesting. Extensive familiarity with the Bible is probably required to get the most out of Fox's work. Those readers who, like me, have a general familiarity but haven't committed the entire work to memory, probably should have a Bible at hand for reference."
3,More of an informational video than a workout video,"Even though Moira is an excellent instructor, this video is so short and there is so much talking that it should be added as a chapter to her Armchair Pilates Plus Flex-Band video and her Stott Pilates - Dynamic Armchair Pilates video. A combination with all three of these videos on 1 DVD would be a great value!"
3,"good at the beginning, boring at the end","In the beginning you would think that this is about ghosts and the devil. But no, it turns out that pluto's got a son who tries to act like the devil. And that Mr.Pluto hates the Darrows, except Pesty! The beginning is good, the end stinks!"
5,Waaay to much talent for one person.,"Michael does a great job looking into the Gospel of John. Using his 'own' translation, he intersperses footnoted commentary with a imaginative narrative style that really helps you visualize the scene. We've used a couple of his books for a small group bible study over the past year; solid teaching to match his fine, bible-centered music."
2,alofft@erols.com,"Awww ... wasn't that cute! I think if Odom had written one more paragraph about how Skater was so good at running the shadows because he never got personally involved I would have puked! The only good part of this novel was that it contained an actual Shadowrunning team. The characters keep telling us how they are professional because they never show emotion, I say that Odom can't write characters with emotions and uses their ""professionalism"" as a crutch! Professional? If they were professional they wouldn't be running the shadows they would be working for a megacorp! The characters were flat, the writing was poor, and the plot was so convoluted that it made reading Dante's Inferno seem pleasent! The last scene with the train made Volcano seem plausible. But, hey what do I know, I've only been reading Shadowrun for the last eight years!"
3,DJ Mark Anthony brings us a better mix than 2001,"After a long intro, track 1 turns into a sexy male vocal track that sounds like what Depeche mode might be recording today if they were willing to go the electronic dance route. And that description fits many of the tracks on this disc, which feel dark and moody, like goth new wave with a modern dance beat. There's a good mix of male and female vocal, as well as some instrumental stuff. It can get repetitive at times, but it far exceeds the tracks on the 2001 edition of Black & Blue. And it also offers a selection of fairly long mixes. Track times:1. all trust is gone (9:52)2. way2tite (5:29)3. Looky thing (6:29)4. elements of Persia (6:29)5. hyperharmonic (6:07)6. come together (6:14)7. Lick the hardcore (7:03)8. strange world (7:16)9. can't shake the feeling (7:09)10. treat me right (8:07)11. everyone else (9:24)"
4,Cute but impractical,"This is a cute toy with many small accessories not mentioned in the product description. Each doll has a blanket, toothbrush and pillow as well as a mask that coordinates with her pajamas. There are little DVDs and popcorn, cookies, soda, cups (only three cups for five dolls, though).If you have a three year old like I do, the cute accessories will get lost within an hour. These dolls do not have brushes and their hair gets very frizzy quickly. The shoes are mule style and fall right off. It might not be easy to tell the racial variety of the dolls from the picture, but all but one are white, and the other is of ambiguous race. Living in an ethnically diverse community, I found this disappointing.All in all, it is a very cute set with many accessories and it is a very good buy. Be forewarned that is is very heavily packaged and you will spend at least half an hour freeing the dolls and accessories from the box. I would say this would be more accurately for 5+ instead of 3."
3,Not like picture,I got the bulb promptly but I put it in my overhead projector and it didn't work. One Tip is a little longer than the another. It said on the bulbOSRAMEnx360W 82VJ768The return for the bulb charges a 15% restocking fee. Make sure this is the right bulb!!!!!!!!
4,A good entrance to the fantasy genre,"This was the first high fantasy book I ever read, so it holds a special place for me. I found it again after many years, and the enjoyment is still there. Sure the book is a little rough, and a bit dated and formulaic. But if you think about when it was written, it was the beginning of serious fantasy. Dragonlance was very popular, and RPG's were gaining serious momentum. Take it as a great example of its time and go from there.That being said, I enjoyed the story then and still do. Ms Wrede's characters jump off the page and her descriptions are outstanding. I would love it if she would revisit Lyra after all these years and write more about the history of the world. You can tell there is a lot fo backstory development that isn't included in the books. Overall, a good read."
5,Is your mom boring? What if she was a sword fighter?!,"Two kids living very normal lives -- who would have thought mom was actually a sword fighter under a powerful spell? What every kid dreaming of adventure longs to happen! Certainly Wrede's best work -- the characters stick with you forever, and the magic of the environment is entrancing"
4,Don't need to be an epic.,"It seems that all the attention is always focused on Jordan, Goodkind, and other epic fantasy writers, and non-epic writers get overlooked.Here's a great book that kept me intrigued and entertained from cover to cover.I don't need epic-proportioned books. This one will do just fine."
2,WARNING: NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS,"These are, for the most part, RE-RECORDED versions of the songs by the original artist. If you're a PURIST, you won't like this CD."
3,Lots of stems and very dried out,"I'm going to be more careful next time I purchase such a high quantity of loose leaf tea as I continue to find myself pulling huge stems out of the mix I received. Also, I thought organice silver needle white tea would have more life in it."
5,Excellent,"I ordered this product to assist with my hair growth as I have done a lot of things i.e. steam treatments, and nothing seems to work. I can say that my hair texture has gotten better and that my edges are growing back in."
4,Caterpillars in the Field and Garden by Tom Allen,"I've created a butterfly garden. This book enables me to identify all the caterpillars and prospective butterflies! What a wonderful handbook for anyone who likes to garden. Now, when I see a number of one certain caterpillar, such as Monarch, I know to plant a few more native milkweed plants. I recommend it."
3,"""He trots the air, the Earth sings when he touches it...""","Each page of this journal contains illustrations of horses by Christopher Wray, and quotations about horses from various authors. The quotation in the header of this review is by William Shakespeare.The pages have a soft tan pseudo-parchment look to them. The paper isn't heavy enough for watercolor or permanent ink, but pencil drawings or chalk would be appropriate. You could certainly use this notebook as a diary, and fill it with your own equine memories. I could wish that the pages had been sewn together, rather than glued if this journal is truly going to last a lifetime. That said, ""The Horse Notebook"" is pleasant to look at and read.Here is another equine observation, this time by Oliver Wendell Holmes:""The sunshine's golden gleam is thrownOn sorrel, chestnut, bay, and roan;The horses paw and prance and neigh,Fillies and colts like kittens play,And dance and toss their rippled manesShining and soft as silken skeins..."""
3,"Pretty good compilation, but was a little slow","I thought that it had a couple of good coices on songs, but it dragged a little in the middle. Glam Rock volume 1 was definitely better."
4,A Great Resource,"I have no previous programming experience. After only five days with this book, I have already built programs beyond the scope of the book. This text lays a strong foundation using simple language and to-the-point examples. The only reason that I do not give it five stars is because it does not include review exercises for you to do on your own and check against prepared solutions."
2,OK for a Workstation,"No problem getting this up and running as a ""workstation"". No more of a chore than any flavor of Windows I've ever tried. But my reason for buying Red Hat Linux is to use it as a server OS. Over two weeks into attempting to integrate my Linux server into a Windows client environment and still not being successful at it makes me think there HAS to be a better way."
5,so far so good.,got it the next day after ordering. so far it works good. i don't need to keep my gaming tower on an angle anymore i have it looped between my 2 monitors. great product :) nice big and sturdy
1,"Looks great, does NOT work","Briefly put, looks great and is sturdy in its built but does NOT work. It decreases the sound output by >50%. What was audible has become a whispering sound. I'm disappointed."
1,Both were faulty,"Received one and it was broken, so I returned through amazon. Returning the product was very simple, as amazon is very efficient doing so. I received a new one and it worked fine at first, but then broke after a few weeks using it. I keep it plugged into my computer at my desk don't move it around at all, so must be due to crappy construction. Thought belkin was a brand name I could trust. I would opt for a cheap non-brand name."
3,"Sturdy Cable, with less than Perfect Heads (Connectors)","I use this cable as an extender for my computer headphones, which have one of those curly cords, the type that stretch really far but want to pull your headphones off your head while rocking out to your favorite music. So, i got this extender cable.Pros:- Sturdy construction, gold plated connectors, thick sturdy cabling probably won't short easilyCons:- Loose connector. It doesn't take but the slightest pulling or tug and the male end of my headphone cable slides out of the extender cable. The design shouldn't be so loose; it should snap in and remain firmly connected. This isn't the case, unfortunately. It's a pretty glaring design flaw, that results in the cable constantly coming unplugged.Overall:- It's a decent cable, works if it is kept perpetually loose; if the slightest stress is applied, it comes unplugged. I wouldn't purchase it again, but that's just my personal experience. For some it might function perfectly."
2,Morrowind is just boring,"I find the graphics to be amazing - but the story is boring and not very easy to follow. It's really easy to mess up and accidentally kill someone crucial to the game later on, which is lame. Basically I was pretty underwhelmed. I bought it because someone said it was like a first person Diablo. NO way. It was not worth the money to me. I am going to try to sell it and buy Dungeon Siege."
4,Very Nice Game,"This is an excellent Role Playing game. The graphics and script are excellent. The AI is very good, although the pathing doesn't work occasionally.But the game is still extremely buggy - locks up or kicks to desktop. Save early and often."
2,"Drab, Depressing, did I mention boring?","The world of Morrowwind looks like a brown ugly swamp. The same drab colors are everywhere you go. Oh ya, and while you tour this uninteresting landscape, you may be attacked by crabs and flies.Interactions with other characters are highly uninteresting, the quests are boring and it takes forever to walk everywhere.Fighting consists of clicking your mouse button over and over to swing your weapon. It's really lame.This game falls way short of the quality of Elder Scrolls I: Arena. If you want a REAL roll playing game, get Baldur's Gate II! That's a modern day classic and you can purchase it for around 20 bucks nwo."
3,Morrowind: Endless Possibilites,"When I started playing Morrowind I was having an absolute blast. The sheer diversity and size of the game made me giddy. I played an entire array of different classes and races. I especially like the ability to create your own class. The game was fun and interesting, but it became tedious and unchallenging. It got to the point where your character will be all but invicible and the game loses its magic."
1,Wait for the patch!!,"This game truly reminds me of Daggerfall, Bethesda does it again, they have created a game with enormous promise that is so buggy at release that it is unplayable. I have run this game on three machine that are all above minimum (one is above recommended) system requirements and this Bug ridden peace of filth has crashed them all. Bethesda's support site actually goes as far as to recommend disabling sound. Here's a recommendation Bethesda, release a game that actually works.Perspective buyers, checked Beshsoft.com and see if they have a patch before you buy. I wish I could comment on the game itself, it looks cool, but I haven't gotten the game to run long enough to judge play"
3,Morrowind,"from what i saw in videos/previews Morrowind looks VERY good.Will *probably* be my next purchase after Dungeon Siege.However, one BIG concern:Morrowind is a single player game - it's hard to imagine playing ""single player"" again after i have so much fun in games like ""Dark Age of Camelot"" and other multiplayer online games.I am sad that they didnt make a multiplayer game out of it... :/Edit: From all what i know (read the many previews on the net from people who actually *played* the beta/preview already!) this is the mother of all RPG games, no question that i will get that game and a ""must have"" for every RPG fan !!! Incredible !!!"
2,Big disapointment... (buy Neverwinter Nights instead!),"This was worst thing i ever bought in my life! I admit the grahics are pretty awsome(and thats why i gave it two stars), but the storyline is just boring and the battles are just to confusing. When you fight you have to click to make a jab,and after 2 min. of that i just want to turn my computer off. Neverwinter Nights is way better!"
1,Buyer Beware,"This program is full of bugs. I am running a system with a 1.8 Ghz Pentium 4, 512MB PC800 RDRAM, 64MB NVIDA GeForce2 MX400 graphics card. This game will not run without serious stutter and hang-up problems. The system requirements box list this as supported hardware, but the readme file included on the CD-Rom list the GeForce2 chipset as a problem. I followed the documentation included with the game and contacted Bethesda. Followed their suggestions and the game still will not run without serious problems, even with everything set on lowest possible settings and latest drivers installed. Buy this game at your own risk, or hope that Bethesda works out it's problems and gets a patch available."
2,Better games out there,"Morrowind is so huge its mind boggling with thousands of decision to make which some big time gamers may see as a plus, but i personally think it is overwhelming and gets EXTREMELY BORING! Plus it is bug written and the game crashes everytime i try to play it after about 10 minutes.If you want a good single player RPG buy ""gothic"" instead. Its much easier to get into with equal to or better graphics and the requirements aren't nearly as huge. ""Gothic 2"" comes out April 17th and i'm literally counting the days until it comes out. So save your money and buy gothic and get to playing."
1,"Morrowind doesn't run, don't buy this game","Not only does the game not run, but Bethesda's tech support offers only the opinion that my video card might not be correct (all my hardware meets or exceeds the specifications on the box, incluidng my NVIDIA video card), or the notion that I should reinstall Direct X 8.1. I have reinstalled Direct X, both from the Morrowind CD and from Microsoft's site; the game still doesn't run. When asked to either offer a repair that will make the current game function, replace the defective game with a functioning one, or refund my money, tech support doesn't even respond. This is not a game or a company that you want to do business with."
1,I have the capability and this game bites,"Man, I bought this game because of all the great reviews and I am terribly disappointed and out [money]. The graphics are great and when the game starts out there is so much potential. Then you discover the dagger in the first room and find out that the fight scenes are going to be very stupid and your movements are not human-like.You will get killed so very quickly so make sure you take lots of potions around with you. The night-time option sounds good, but you can't see a damned thing.The quests are also nice and there are many of them, but I think that there are games out there like Dungeon Seige that are better equipped. Dungeon Seige is way more repetitive than this game which is about it's only plus.I will be selling mine ... so come buy it....I thought it [was bad] but you might enjoy it..........NAH.RECOMMENDATION: COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY"
1,Like running through Jello,"I like this series so much I still play the old Daggerfall on my p2 450, but Bethesda seems to have dropped the ball on the latest installment for the Elder Scrolls.Running this on my fastest computer (which is well above specs for this game), anything other than the absolute lowest resolution is so frame-rate poor it is impossible to even navigate the user interface. At this resolution, the interface does not scale, so the GUI becomes very hard to use.They also took it upon themselves to neuter my favorite class, the monk, by making them do fatigue damage now instead of physical damage."
1,If you want a game that works out of the box: DONT BUY THIS,If you've played many pc games in your life no doubt you are quite used to buggy games that don't work of the box. It's something I guess we better get used to as more and more games are shipped out in this sorry state. I guess it's too much to askfor a[n expensive] game to actually work correctly.
4,Not in great condition,"This book was labeled as ""used, very good condition."" I would call it's condition fair at best."
1,Difficult to Follow,"Even an experienced user would find this difficult to follow. If you make it through the first half of the book without throwing it away completely, don't even bother with the second half. You will find more value out of most any other Flash book."
4,A Utah pop-classical singer of some note,"A decently pleasant album in the vein of someone like Josh Groban, and worth picking up. He comes from a musical background of some importance: his mother was one of the members of the Contessas, a pop group that signed for a while to Barry Gordy's Motown series of labels, and recorded some of the earliest work by great songwriter Jimmy Webb about 1965. An artist well worth checking out."
5,Life Changing,"This book just happened to be lying around my office one day. It seemed to be interesting as I thought I might have a drinking problem. I read it and it changed my life! It convinced me that I was an alcoholic. I knew then that I could not drink safely again. Most disturbing was its prediction of my future, which mostly became true. Although I did not quit soon after reading the book, I now have 17 clean years and am extremely greatful!"
3,Interesting information,"I find this book fascinating. Having worked in the treatment field for a long time and having worked at Lakeside-Milam (which Milam started) I feel comfortable recommending and discussing this material.I've met Dr. Milam and used to listen to him lecture. Interesting guy, soft-spoken, and full of knowledge. He is a true pioneer.I've also been fortunate enough to work at Schick Shadel Hospital. If you like the work of Dr. Milam, I would invite you to check out the work from Dr. James W. Smith. Dr. Smith has been practicing addiction medicine since 1960. He is Board Certified in Family Practice and certified by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM).Dr. Milam was a pioneer, Dr. Smith is a legend. Knowing both approaches I'm excited to move forward in my body of knowledge."
1,Save your money,"I knew I was in trouble when I realized the ""book"" was less than a quarter inch thick. In fact, you get less than the tutorial section that's included *free* with every copy of HotDocs."
4,Another typical french romantic comedy!,"The movie is a typical french romantic comedy and this is rather a complement. As usual in such films you can expect deep pchylogical observations, in this case of quite unstable single woman in her thirties (played fabulously by Karin Viard). There is plenty of humor and even sarcasm in the movie. I was rather a little disappointed by the ending (contrary to what some other viewers said here) since I felt that it somehow didn't follow the spirit of the movie - therefore only four stars. But overall, if you like romantic comedies and/or like french movies you will not be disappointed."
5,great book,This book was very hard to put down. Sarah is a 19 year old girl from the bottom of the hill who is courted by David whose family are from the top of the hill. His mother is the mother from hell who of course hates Sarah. Sarah also has a step-father who is from hell. The story goes through Sarah's life which is not good. Catherine Cookson is a wonderful writer.
4,Mitsubishi Diamond Series WD-57831,"I've had my set for about two weeks. It replaced a 5 year old Toshiba rear projection HDTV.I watch Time Warner Cable, HD DVDs (Toshiba HD A2) and Blue Ray HD DVDs (SONY PS3). I have been pleased with the picture quality of HD material on all three mediums. I find the standard definition Cable picture quality inferior to the quality of standard definition on our standard defiinition (480i) TVs. Upconverting standard DVDs works well and produces a fine picture on the WD-57831.My one complaint so far concerns the WD-57831 cooling fan. Its quite noisy. Otherwise I love the set and the price was right= $2400 including shipping."
1,"Cute, but horrible sound quality","I bought this for my daughter to play her ipod in thinking it was cute, but the sound is total crap. It is very muffled and not any bit clear. I have a $100 speaker for my ipod and the sound quality is excellent. Of course I wanted to return this bear but we already destroyed the box it came in...save your money up for a nice speaker if you want even average sound quality!"
1,Not what it looks like,"I was really excited to get the Train Sim studio thinking that it was going to have some templates and other aids to use in building my own rolling stock to use in Microsoft's Train Simulator. How disappointed I was to find that absolutely nothing is included except a bare studio and some toddler-quality circus wagon-graphics. I guess I feel a little cheated because the picture on the box clearly shows the 3D graphic design of an F7. Therefore, one would assume that a basic F7 Sim would have been included, right? Wrong. You have to buy that as an extra add-on package - another $30. Granted, the tools are there to do basic 3D design. But it's far more complicated that one might think.So I guess my review would be this: Unless you throroughly understand CGI 3D graphics, this product is not for you or me."
1,Errors can cost you,"TurboTax seems determined to give me a $30,000 deduction I do not deserve. Wonderful if it was real. I have uninstalled the software, reinstalled, updated, and reentered my data twice. This is a bug. The only response I get from Intuit is survey's asking for feedback on the response I got to my trouble report.Do not waste your money."
2,What? These aren't the final forms?!?,"TurboTax worked very well for pointing out possible deductions and walking me through questions on everything from income to expenses--but at the end, it threw an error message telling me that I couldn't actually file my returns yet, because TurboTax didn't include the final version of the actual tax return forms. When I called their 1-800 number for availability, the recording said that the final versions wouldn't be available until mid-March. Yikes!"
2,Dangit!,It should be more clear that this version does not included the state download!!!!!!!!!!!!! I returned it!
1,Trubo Tax Bait and Switch,I am disgusted by Turbo Tax last year I purchased an on line version with a discount from my employer and that version included free e-file.This year I purchased the software and only when I completed my return did I find out this software did not include free e-file and it would cost me $29.95 more on top of the price of the software. Bait and Switch as far as I am concerned.I do not need to pay for software to prepare my return just to mail it in. I can do that easily and much quicker with free forms from the IRS. I purchase these programs for the free e-file.Turbo tax does not make it clear that when you buy these products that e-file is not included their disclame is an afterthought in small print.Beware.
3,Parts of it are nice...,"The info portion in the beginning is a bit wordy, but once you get to the actual journal part, I appreciate that there is plenty of space for information and a place to save the label if you choose. Its not small, but it is a nice looking journal. Perhaps not one I would take to a wine tasting, but certainly one I would use to journal my wines at home."
1,WHHEEEEEEEEEEEE DOGGIES!!!,"Spectacular Epic of Monumental Proportions. A first-rate action adventure classic suspense sci-fi fantasy country-western educational comedy drama thriller gang-bang documentary. Head and shoulders above the other great films of it's genre (The Godfather, Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino, etc). Definitely a crowning achievement. It will probably go down as the #1 movie of all time. Also, the check is in the mail, I'll respect you in the morning, and I have a bridge for sale. YOU BETCHA!!!"
4,Not a great movie,"It's still fun to watch. I watched it several years ago, and finally bought a copy. Now that Patrick Swayze is gone, I kind of feel nostalgic for his movies."
1,"I love yes, bit this poor production burying the bass is inceptable",This album really stinks because of a very low bass level from Squire. Buy yessongs or keys to ascention 1.
2,this is not a field guide,I read the other review and was deceived. The other reviewer made it sound like a field guide comparing it to Peterson. NO!!!! There are a total of 45 color plates covering less than 500 of the about 1500 Brazilian birds and some of these plates are black and white.
2,Word 97 for Windows for Dummies,I bought this for my Mom who has no computing experience. It's unfortuneate that they don't use windows tools instread it is all about alt and function keys. What a good way to confuse a beginner!
5,Excellent for tutors,This book is excellent for anyone tutoring reading in early grades.It helps one understand the process of learning to read.
1,Keep Looking,"I love the music of this period, and this album in no way represents it well. The publishers could have selected MUCH better artists & tracks. Wish I had something to recommend, but I'm still looking too. Peace."
1,no passion,"Though the cold hard facts are present, I found a lack of passion towards what Mr. Prunier was writting about. He may have felt compassion towards the estimated 1,000 brutally murdered people, but he did not express it in his words. For practically the whole book you learn about the politics involved but not the people, the real people. The lack of enthusiasm and compassion make this book dry and uninteresting towards the younger audience. Mr. Prunier is a very good author but he needs to show, in words, his feelings, not the cold hard facts. NOT everything is as black and white as some may see it to be."
4,Super good book !,"Super good book, I would purchase this product if I had to, to fill my head with knowledge.I would recommend this Super good book to everyone."
1,I live in the North End and this was the worst film of all time.,I live in the North End and this was the worst film of all time. Good god I wanted to like this movie. It was painful. The plot jumps around and makes no sense whatsoever. The only enjoyable part was the main female leads copious amount of cleavage. Mama Mia stay away!
3,Wanted it mainly for the car adaptor,"I just bought an antique car and didn't want to spoil the interior with a new deck so I bought this after reading the rave reviews. I'm not sure if its just the one I bought, but the CD player itself is very difficult to operate. Sometimes I have to hit the same button 3 or 4 times with no luck. 2 seconds later it will work just fine. The car adaptor works great though. I plan on finding a CD player at a garage sale to use instead of this one."
1,Not Origianl,"Sooo dissappointed! We have used this cheesoning for years and absolutely love it. However, the cheesoning pack we just recieved is very much a golden color as apposed to an orange color that picture shows and that we have always received. Unfortunately it does not have the cheese taste and is nothing like what we have used for years."
5,If you want to know about Witchcraft: Read this first!,"This is the very first book I picked up on the topic of Witchcraft and have been following that path ever since. In 96 pages it provides all the answers to frequently asked questions, as well as allowing the reader to use the text as a qualifier on whether or not Witchcraft speaks to them. Let me tell you what I tell everyone who approaches me wanting to know more about the Old Religion: If you feel a warmth in your heart chakra and a sense of ""knowing you are not alone"" upon reading this book; you may have found your religion. An' it harm none, do what thou wilt!"
1,I am dumbfounded by postive reviews for the Flip Switch,The Belkin Flip Switch (for all its models) are baddly designed. Most units will fail to work within a couple of months and there is no customer service. I wonder if the people that gave the Flip Switch a postive review would do so after a couple of months?Just read the reviews for the other models (no need me to add thing more) - you would think this is the worst product ever made.I tried to contack Belkin with no results. Their website says to email a specific address that in turn directs you to a non-existant webpage. Only course of action is to send a letter.
4,Nearly perfect...,"Plugs in very simply, and of course operates with the push of a button. One issue and it is somewhat serious. For some reason the scroll wheel on my mouse will occasionally tell the browser to go back a page instead of scrolling down. This only happens when plugged into the belkin, not when plugged in directly to the PC."
5,BelOMO 10x Triplet Loupe Magnifier and nylon lanyard,"I can't say enough about this product. I can't carry a microsope around on excursions, but this loupe is conveniently accessible from my pocket for me to do an on-the-spot examination of insects, spiders, and other small creatures of nature. The lens are of superb quality. It is well made. The lanyard is comfortable and good to use with a quick release buckle. I JUST LOVE IT!intobugs"
5,For the traveling fisherman!,"Leave it to Charlie to find even more Pennsylvania streams! He even includes notable waters in NJ and Ny. This book gives you the opportunity to fish streams that don't get the pressure of some of the more famous waters. The author's cover waters large and small. The book is a bargain, and at retail price equates to 39 cents per stream! Try to find a guide for that."
3,QUICK VERSE VERSION 7 ESSENTIALS,I had preivious versions of Quick Verse and loved them but they would not work on my latter WINDOWS. So I thought I was getting a deal but little did I know it would not install the bibles on my hard drive so I have to use the cd to read the bibles. If you have a fix for this I would appreciate someone letting me know. Thank youjw wilkoski949-650-7702 jwilk2@adelphia.netQuickverse Essentials Version 7
5,English Landscape-You just have to be there!,It is a wonderful book telling about all the hills and valleys and walking trails of England. You haven't seen an English country side until you have visited England. Highly recommend this book. Nice pictures and information.
4,Christmas gift...,"I bought this as a gift for my 6 year old son. He really enjoyed painting each of the dinosaurs and then getting to play with the finished product. However, the brush (only one came with the set)is not the best so he ended up using other brushes he had with wider & narrower tips. Also, the paint chips if you play too rough with them. Overall, I still gave this 4 stars since my son really enjoyed this gift."
4,Great for a 5 year old who is into Dinosaurs,"I got this toy for my son's 5th birthday. He is currently into dinosaurs so I thought he would like this and also get to be a little creative. He ignored all of the other toys when he opened this kit. I'm considering buying the other types of kits. my 7 year old also enjoyed helping his brother paint the dinosaurs. It is not very messy, but paint is involved so an adult should definitely watch, unless kids are outside painting! Overall a very great idea."
2,A little less than I expected....,"Thought this was a great deal and all considering our ""newest addition"" is our last addition to the family and liked the idea that it converts into a toy box....However, the removable bassinet will not stay in place so if I actually get it to sit right on the base I don't want to remove it. One of the casters broke the first day I got it, which doesn't matter too much because I don't think it would rock very smooth anyway. It is a cute style though."
5,GRABS YOU AND KEEPS YOU!,"Prophecy of Swords really grabs you and pulls you in! I found it a real page turner, the characters enjoyable with their bantering, and heroic deeds. I hope Hagel, the dragon becomes one of your favorite characters too!"
2,"buy for graphics, NOT reflective qualities","I bought these for reflective feature, for riding my bike at night. The graphics are pretty wild, but they DO NOT REFLECT LIGHT as advertised. I'll keep them just because the bold graphics stand out and at least that will attract some attention and provide a small degree of safety, just not at night."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!,"I love the Mandie books and this is like my fav. one!!!! i'm 12 and i personly bealive the earlier Mandie books are better. she grows up too fast!! any way, i think all of the Mandie books are good, but this one is expesialy awesome!!!!"
3,"Good, but there are better","Gun is fine most of the time, but it has some glitches that drive me crazy. Fist off, a new feature is that this gun takes 4 slides of nails, 1 more than previously. This feature combined with the top load feature on this gun cause the nail heads to stick up in the top load area and not feed properly, which causes the gun the jam. The gun also double fires way too much, especially when the compressor kicks on. At 120 psi, this gun still does not set ring shank nails into 3/4 OSB. The older bostitch guns are much better, as are all Paslode and Max framers. Spend a few more $$$ on Paslode or Max, or a few $$$ les on the older models by Bostitch."
4,A stunning new voice,"Tananarive Due is the first African-American woman to write books that verge on horror and often are pure urban fantasy. Her characters are African and African-American. The characters of other ethnic and racial backgrounds are peripheral to her stories. This is her first novel. I found it more dificult to read than The living Blood and My Soul To Keep , but only because the story construction is more complex. Hilton James and his family (his wife is a newly elected judge) are threatened by a racist who promises to kill all of them. The complexity is created by Hilton's previous life. Did his grandmother die and come back to life to oversee Hilton's growing up? Did Hilton drown as a boy or was he rescued by that same grandmother or both? Due doesn't answer these questions. She leaves the answers to the reader.This is an amazing debut novel. Hers is a voice to remember and Hilton and his family will haunt your dreams."
3,Not up to traditional Lonely Planet standards,"Lonely Planet Andalucia is clearly inferior to Rough Guide Andalucia and below the standards I have come to expect from Lonely Planet. I found repeatedly that the author(s) appear morei interested in cutesy writing style than in incisive fieldwork and allowed their infatuation with their glib comments to gloss over their lack of good travel writing and description. The guides to eating are almost useless. For those who think otherwise, check the section Where to Eat in Seville. For those who make the mistake of buying the book, I suggest you don't even bother with the reviews of eating places.I decided to leave my Lonely Planet Andalucia in Seville and brought my Rough Guide home with me.The series editors need to clamp down on the writing style of the individual volumes and force them to write for the traveler,not for themselves."
2,Problems with his CD Player,When I saw this on line it looked good but when I received it and played a CD on it and I was walking around it skips I really like this walkman because it has FM/AM radio I can not take it back because I broke the package that it came in. So in regards to this CD Player DON'T BUY IT PLEASE.
4,great expose forget grammatical complaints,"having lived on the ""other sideof the fence"" as an insider during this time; i can say that sally got pretty close in her portrayal of her events. sure some is educated guesswork, but she did an admiral job nonetheless. i have been trying to put the story down from the inside looking out as a survivor of a dangerous time and am considering that perhaps it should be presented as fiction as i review progress. the rest of the story is almost unbelievable. sally has shown what a good investigative reporter is capable of. yes, it is true that some considered retribution at the time she wrote this book. tells me its worth reading ......again."
3,Out come of greed,Love reading true stories..well written story line is strong trough the whole book. Interesting people and astounding plot. Mind blowing what people will do when taken over by greed
1,Don't Be Disillusioned,"So the Bhagwan gradually became insulated by an inner circle of advisers and was corrupted by fame,drugs and endless adulation.We read of this happening to people time and time again.Let's not lose sight of the fact that many of his early discourses put into book form are profound and insightful.He and his followers created a city in the middle of nowhere, an incredible accomplishment."
4,Very nicely done.,"Now, I am a pretty big Manson fan, and have been since sometime in '95 or so, and I must say that I really enjoyed this album. I have to disagree with the general consensus that the Beautiful People is better here than on Antichrist; I personally prefer the studio version due to it's itensely pounding synthetic beats. I like drums, don't get me wrong, and if I didn't ahve a pre-existing version of TBP in my head I may hav felt differently. As for the rest of it, it is very good, and manson's antics are highly entertaining. I absolutely love End Times, but can see why it was cut from Antichrist. It is superior to many of the songs on that album, but serves the same purpose as The Reflecting God in terms of storyline, which is a masterpiece. Astonishing panorama... however, is a marvellous bridge between Antichrist and Mechanical Animals. All in all, a highly enjoyable purchase, worth every penny and worth listening to again and again."
5,i hate live cds but...,"this ones great, i mean the quality is good, its not so boring, they entertain its just fun all around."
1,bait & switch,Order new and sent a used one. had to pay for the postage back. never answer my emails or phone calls. be careful people
2,Jack phoned this in!,"Am I the only woman reviewing this? Oh well, Higgins is a favorite when I want intrigue and action and a fast read. I am big fan. I love Sean Dillon and the rest of the gang, but this book was a little lame. However, having said that, please know that I bought and read this book with relish. I can see why the 'guys' were disappointed. This was really not his best but it got me thru a plane trip!"
1,The Characters are Cartoonish,"I have read most of Jack Higgins' books, and he has been one of my favorite authors back to high school (over 20 years). I have enjoyed his older books and new books, and purchase them almost immediately upon publication. Unfortuntately, Day of Reckoning is terrible. The story lines and sub-plots are full of cliche's, and the characters are cartoonish. No one is likable in this book, or believable. It almost seems like a knock- off author tried to write this book and pass it off as a Higgins work. As much as I like Higgins and the Sean Dillon character, this book is not worth the time it took to read it. The only plus to the book is that it is a fast read, much like a bad comic book."
3,Not That Bad ...,"I picked this book up on a whim, read it quickly, and enjoyed it for the most part. I was surprised by the overwhelming distaste for this book by Amazon reviewers.A few words of warning ... It is a highly simple story with no real surprises. The characters are stilted and the dialogue is indeed choppy.Even with these faults, for some reason, I found myself drawn into the story and truly enjoying the downfall of Jack Fox.Not the best book I have ever read, but definitely not the worst! If you like invincible heroes, over-the-top action, and vindictive revenge, give this one a chance."
3,Day of Reckoning,"I love Jack Higgens, but this was one of his weakest yet. Felt like I was reading a cartoon book without the pictures. But, never the less, I enjoyed it. Sean Dillion is a fun character."
1,Couldn't wait to put it down,"I have enjoyed several of Jack Higgins other books but I could not wait to finish this one. Nothing in the story got me interested in the characters or what was happening to them. I am used to, and often enjoy, suspending belief when reading these types of stories but there is a limit to how much one can take. When the ""good"" guys win every battle, even when teaming up with inexperienced ""bad"" guys, the thrill is gone.There was also too much dialogue in the book and not enough writing setting-up the characters or the story. It appears Jack Higgins may have run out of steam. Maybe the next book will be better."
3,$49.99. You're friggin' nuts!,"Good songs, but the clown trying to sell for $49.99 needs his head seen to."
1,SOHC-5232K not SOHR-5238S,"Ordered 2 from Amazon.com and was shipped SOHR-5238S drives, which are CD-RW drives only. 52x32x52. They are the new version of the 52327S drives that had EEproms.The correct drives are good drives and do read DVD,s. Do a search on Amazon.com and look at all the products listed ""new and used"" and you will see that a lot of them list the wrong drive. Look at the SKU number. It should be SOHC-5232K.It should have ""DVD"" right in the middle of the tray.Be careful where you order."
3,Average book but you need HANDS ON,The book is good but you half to have allot of hands on for this test. Do notuse this as your only study source
5,Great Pool Accessory!,This gator inflatable is great! I like the handles and the fact that it's large enough for an adult to ride on. I always wanted one of these as a kid. It was great to finally get one.
4,A fun pool toy,"This float is a two person rider which is fun when having contests. I've seen funner toys other than this but it is kinda fun. Their is no educational value other than alligators swim. My friend had this float for two years and then it popped when she put it in her pool. Overall, their are better toys but a good float for $10."
3,PANDORA's WISHES .............,"Mirror, mirror on the wall ........Yes, in this one the lady does talk to the mirror, [literally] but who is there? An intriguing premise - revolving around the old chesnut : ""Be careful what you bet - you might just lose your head..."".There's plenty happening at this old Chateau when con-man Delon [stunning as usual] meets up with the ""Fonda babe"", niece to the mysterious mirror lady....Rene Clement, that Gallic suspense master who previously introduced us to M. Delon in ""Purple Noon"" [the early ""Talented Mr. Ripley""] dishes up this little plate of suitably tainted hors d'oeuvres.Costumes by Pierre Balmain, music by Lalo Schifrin.Road buddy? Antonioni's ""The Passenger"""
2,Wow,"Dude, this game is so hard to use. If you plan on buying this, you better know what you're doing already because Punch! sure won't help you figure it out. If you're a first time buyer (like me) of this kind of software, don't let the box fool you into thinking it's novice friendly (box quotes ""Simple or Complex, Novice or Pro..."") because it's definitely not. I'm sure the program is very powerful but with very few walkthroughs and near no help from the 400 page manual, I'll never be able to get the full worth out of the game."
1,Does Not Fit,Package says 3-8. Tutu inside says it is a 4-6. My daughter wears a size four or five and this is so small on her that she can not wear it. If you have a child that is a size three or smaller then this might work for you but any bigger forget about it!!
4,Big Time,"The book feels like it ought to be trash. But it isn't. It is histrionic - almost, but not quite, to the point of absurdity; and is really a compulsive read."
4,Ann Becker,"I purchased the electric kettle jug, because I had owned one before and it went bad. I was disappointed in the new one, as I only used it for four days and discovered rust spots on the bottom. I wrote to the company and they had me return it, and now am waiting for a replacement kettle. Was not happy that I had to pay the extra postage to return the kettle to Canada."
3,Swat Vest,Overall the vest is great. The only thing I did not like was the size of the walkie talkie holder. It is a little small only some kind could actually fit.
5,its a MAGLITE,"Great flashlight. bought a mount kit aswell and mounted the flashlight in my truck. MAGLITES are almost indestructable. dropped my dads mag into lake michigan a few years back doing some salmon fishing off the pier. It bounced off the concrete from about 5 feet and bounced right into the lake, light still on. came back the next day and some guy was pulling it out. when he got it to the surface the light was still on."
3,"Interesting Idea, Average Execution","In John Maddox Roberts' world, Phillip of Macedon stopped dithering around and sent reinforcements to Hannibal, giving Hannibal the numeric superiority he needed to force Rome's surrender. Hannibal - implausibly - gives the Roman's the option of exile. Over one hundred years later a once-again powerful Rome seeks to return to the Mediterranean.Other than Hannibal's gaffe, Roberts' vision rings true in nearly every respect. One cannot help but believe that this exactly how the western world would have looked after a Punic victory. Unfortunately, Roberts' prose is average at best and at times plodding: the Grisham of alternative history novels, if you will. Some maps, any maps, would have been helpful also, especially for picturing the extent of the Roman Norican empire.Overall, Hannibal's Children is an amusing tale but by no means fine literature."
2,Looks like a Junior High School science project,"This book appears to have been slapped together with less than two weeks of work. I was constantly confused by discrepancies between the descriptions and the photographs. Lichens described as bright green, chartreuse, orange, red, etc., were all about the same dull shade of gray-brown in the pictures. This may be due to poor photography, poor reproduction, or the fact that the lichens pictured are old dessicated herbarium specimens rather than living lichens in their natural setting."
4,Math Made Easy: fifth grade Workbook,The book is great for a review over the summer. Our child has problems with math and this is keeping him up to speed with his math for next year. We will be doing the same thing for 6th grade
2,Pop Prog,"Lots of high end prog rock musicainship for sure but if ""Flower Power"" is a typical Flower Kings album ( this is the only one I've heard) then I have to say the guys lack good taste. Although the album contains many soulful and uplifting moments, the overall effect is undermined by insipid lyrics and musical cliches gleaned from the worst of 70's pop. I was hoping for a comparison with classic Yes but this is more like Styx or late Kansas.The lead vocals sounds too run of the mill for my taste and would be better suited to an Andrew Lloyd Webber rock opera."
1,Worst quality tie I've ever owned,"This is (err, was) the worst quality tie I've ever owned. The material was so thin and the manufacturing so poor that when I tied the knot the lowest part of the tie pulled and puckered and would not lie flat. It was just really, really inferior. I should have known better, since I got exactly what I paid for -- maybe even less than I paid for since I threw the tie away after one wearing. Please learn from my mistake."
5,Caterina Sorscone,Caterina scorscone is a great actress and have always loved her work.If you look closely she has the most beautiful eyes.I love all her work on and off screen.
5,love it love it love it,"am obsessed with Alice in Wonderland and try to get my hands on every version i can find. Was so excited to buy this, at not only an amazing price, but received it in no time at all. (Without putting up more money for faster shipping) awesome condition and VERY satisfied customer"
5,Liked this WAY more than I expected.,"I'm not sure what to call this. I've seen fairy tales and kids' stories done in weird, creepy, warped ways, and this doesn't fit the bill.Whatever you want to call it, this version of Alice in Wonderland was a lot of fun, a lot of laughs, and had me on the edge of my seat more than would be expected for a story that's already been done before. The twists and turns are creative (not shocking or anything) to the point that you'll be able to recognize elements of the original story without feeling bored."
5,A GREAT movie!,"We watched this movie first on SyFy, and couldn't wait for the DVD to come out so we could watch it again! My 10 and 12 year old daughters both love Alice, and this dvd was purchased for them. We highly recommend it for older kids and adults alike."
1,alice,"Would love to review this blu ray dvd but unfortunately, no notifiction at time of order as to the area code of the dvd. Area code listed as A/1. Since our bluray player plays 1 we assumed it would work. Misleading. Hence, we are unable to play it - at all! Sadly disappointed Amazon!"
4,Loved it on TV - even better with no commercials!,"I caught this on SciFi (or is it SyFy now?) when it first aired and was completely immersed in the story. This is not your Disney Alice, this is a much darker story and a lot more grown up than the cartoon (and not quite as surreal as the recent one with Johnny Depp). The general flow is very similar to Lewis Carrol's original story, just told through a lens of Alice being an adult and with a bit of romance thrown in for fun too.This is going into our collection to get played once or twice a year!"
5,Great Read,"It is an exhaustive introduction to the modern era, which is both very well written and insightful. I would not recommend it to anyone completely unfamiliar with the events of the 20th century, because I think it could be a little overwhelming. But, anyone who is serious about understanding these events should read this book. It takes a center-right (or moderately conservative) viewpoint of this history, which is very refreshing amongst all of the left-wing interpretations most people are currently exposed to."
1,Right wing propaganda of an extreme form,"This book is flagrant, biased right wing drivel at its worst. Paul Johnson admires dictators like Pinochet and Franco and criticizes JFK for ending the Cuban Missile Crisis without a war. He loves some of the worst of American presidents like Coolidge and Nixon. I read this book before in my late teens when under heavy conservative influence. Now, reading it with an open mind, I realize what a crock it is. I have five books by this blatantly pro-Catholic reactionary in my library, and I am giving them all away (or, if no one wants them, using them as kindling for my next fire)."
5,"Highly Readable, Informative, Brilliant","A brilliant narrative connecting the seminal history-making dots of the 20th century. Highly enligthening analysis of totalitarianisms and political myths--some of which are still bedeviling our 21st century. Revealing snapshots of major political personalities--Lenin, Nehru, etc.A book not to be missed if you want to be informed about the historical forces that are shaping our world today. Plus, Paul Johnson's prose is superb."
4,Like Catnip for Humans,"OK, I'll admit I always wondered what it is about catnip that gives a 'high' to cats, and now I know. This very enjoyable collection of cat tidbits explains catnip, purring, 'kneading' and other cat phenomena. The section dealing with myths and legends about cats is really fascinating. I never knew there were so many wild (and dangerous) misconceptions about cats. I also never knew that so many famous people through history were cat lovers--including Cleopatra, Winston Churchill, and Mark Twain. I'm writing this before Christmas, so I'm remembering the wonderful legend connecting the Nativity with the 'M' on the foreheads of tabby cats. I wish this book had better illustrations, frankly, but that is a minor point since it is a good read and a good stocking stuffer for any cat lover that is hard to buy for."
2,A curious film,"It opens in club-land; flashing lights and writhing bodies. The protagonists work in a hospital, in the morgue. An event takes place that sets off a chain of responses; one, stunningly surprising. To mention the event would give the entire plot away. The plot becomes divergent. Weird things start happening. I continued watching, wondering what the point might be. It's certainly complicated. Club-land returns. More unfathomable stuff follows and then... It's a curious film on which the point was certainly missed by me.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
5,Great cat toy!,"I tie this feather on the end of a weighted fishing line, (Norelco fishing pole) and my cats will chase it for hours!"
3,"Ok, but not as good as the original feathers",We keep a tin of various attachments for da bird and this one seems to get used the least. My cat's favorites are (in order of most to least favorite):1 Da Bird Fur Fun2 Da Bird Original3 Da Bird Sparkly attachment4 Da Bird Kitty Puff
1,Big disappointment,"Although the picture shows 3 items, I was only shipped one. Note that the product description doesn't mention this. Very decieving. I feel I was ripped off. Buyer beware!!"
5,cannot wait for his next book...,"if you grew up in this country in the last few decades of the century, this story will take you back again...beginning in the 60's with a woman who frees herself from a conventional marriage that cannot meet her deepest needs...the author tells it brilliantly and all too insightlyfully as he takes on his mother's success, failure, happiness as if his well being is tightly wound up with hers. its a coming of age story for both the boy and his mother, one that we can relate to, its a charm."
3,"O.k. book, good","This book, written by former Deputy Chief Counsel to the HSCA Gary Cornwell, is an o.k. book, factually speaking, but a good read, nonetheless. No major revelations.[...]"
4,My Review,"C.S. Lewis strikes again he is such a amazing writer,in which he writes The Chronicles of Narnia Series, This Review is on ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."" It is such an exciting, emotional,and a very detalied magical story. It's described with such beautiful imagery, cool battles, and sacrifice, the story even though its an exciting book it is a really childish book. This book reminds me of how me and my sister used to pretend we can fly and go in different worlds and fight monsters. It really had alot of imagination, which actually had me sit down and think of how cool it would actually be if in real life we were able to. I got really into this book, i give it an A!!!"
5,texas rap,"supertight album from the legendary group.i have both,ug railroad and hit`em where it hurt UNOPENED 4 SALE for decent price as well as tons of other rare out of print rap cds.EMAIL."
4,"""Kennedy's Children--all magnets""","Boy, this takes me back to my college years--after the glorious debut album, ""New Clear Days"" the Vapors had nowhere to go but down, slightly. The songs are much darker lyrically (the title track especially), and the reggae-flirtations might've been done a little better by the Clash a few years earlier, (""Silver Machines"" wouldn't be out of place on the 2nd Elvis Costello record) but the hooks are still there and the production is first-rate. This doesn't sound like it's 30 years old--hell, Green Day could release this tomorrow with their faces on the cover and sell millions. If all you know of this overlooked band is ""Turning Japanese"" do yourself a favor and get their only 2 studio recordings--the remastered versions include single edits and other goodies."
3,Strange Assortment,This book is meant for young children to identify birds they might see. I think it has a very peculiar assortment of birds - some are very difficult to see: Bald Eagle? Peregrine Falcon? It would take a pretty amazing child to be able to see and identify an American Redstart! It would be much better to create regional editions so a child could hope to see more than a few of the birds featured in this book.
3,Dissappointed,"I did not receive a paperback. Instead, I received papers. I had to bound them myself at Kinkos."
1,ridiculous,This movie was downright awful. It went through every conceivable plot twist. Every type of situation was played out and it just ended up being disappointed. I give it a star though because the opening shots of that campus are simply beautiful. What school was that? I want to go there.
3,Decent film,"Put all of the ""this plot has been done before"" thoughts aside, and this is a pretty decent movie. Actually, I thought it was more surprising and more believable that some of the other teen/colleage age horror/murder films. It had me wondering right up until the end if my assumption of what was really going on was right. I think it is definitely worth checking out."
2,Psychotic Beverley Hills 90210,"This is a psychotic version of Beverley Hills 90210, and it isn't even good escapism. However, the Cast was really great (they look good too). They did really well with such a lame generic script. The plot was transparent and predictable if you THINK as you watch. The soundtrack was terrible. Even if the soundtrack was better, it would not have saved the movie. Keep the cast get a tighter, snappier script, better directing and editing. To fully enjoy, leave your brain at the door."
1,definitely ridiculous,The campus they show at the beginning of the movie is of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Go there. It rocks. Unlike this movie. Which sucks. That's really all you can say about it. Simply terrible. Too bad that they showed Hopkins. At least they did't mention the school in the credits at the end. I hope they paid them to shoot a movie that bad there.
2,Is it really for Kindergarteners?,"For some reason, the decks themselves say ages 4-5, rather than 5-6. Can't figure out why since the box (which was sealed)says Kindergarten 5-6. Content is way too easy for my 5 y.o. Disappointed..."
3,It's ok,Remember these flash cards when my kids were young and they loved them. They don't seem quite as fun for my granddaughter on the kindle app
4,Makes my Grandson's eyes look more blue!,A warm garment for the chill of the desert southwest. Washes easily and fits well. I really like the color and it is a very cozy garment for a little man.
4,Runs small,"Just received the jacket in the mail. It's very small for an 18m size. In addition, not designed for the ""pot belly"" that my son has. The front-bottom of the jacket is shorter than the back-bottom. Shipping is $7 to return, original item was $12 + $7.50 shipping. I'll keep it to give as a gift. Quality is nice."
3,Item runs small,"I ordered a 4T for my son to wear this winter. He is currently in a 3T, but this jacket fits him in the torso now. Oddly enough, the sleeves are too long though, and we do not normally have this problem with clothing. It is still cute, but I'll be lucky if we can make it through winter with this jacket!"
2,a disappointment,"I am editing my previous review of this jacket to lower the star rating because the zipper just broke after only 6 weeks of normal wear. Otherwise, I wanted to confirm what other people said about the sizing. I ordered 3T for my two-year-old who normally wears 2T, and it just fits him. He is 36"" and 30 lbs. I know that I will only get one season out of this jacket. Otherwise, it is very soft and warm, and seemed to be well-constructed until the zipper broke. The color (electric avenue blue) is true to the pictures."
1,"It's cheap, and worth every penny!","I've purchased a LOT of radios to listen to the ball games and this one, I'm sorry to say, wasn't very good. Spend a little more money and get more radio."
4,Good for the money,"Well I didn't know what to expect. But we were pleasantly surprised. I bought several of these to take to a convention with FM transmission. Worked perfectly. The first day, we forgot to turn it off, so we used the batteries up. We were worried that the mini radios would run through batteries. But it was actually fine. They worked the whole 3 days. Light weight, easy for elderly and young alike to use. Not super great quality, but for the price, well worth it."
2,COBY CX-71 mini radio,"You get what you pay for. Stations bleed over into one another, and often I was listening to 2 or 3 at a time. Very annoying. When the signal is clear and strong, it wasn't too bad."
3,Good but very popish,It has its highlights. It kinda sounds like an 80s teen movie soundtrack at times. Solid song writing & I will check out the new stuff when it comes out

5,Meaning of being a Christian,"I have tried to live the Christian life by my own and I have failed.The same author's ""Classic Christianity"" was life changing book for me.Now I understand why Apostle said, ""I am crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me"". Christian life is all about Christ living in and through us. It's a wonderful thing. Today even well meaning Christians try to ""add"" to the COMPLETED work of Christ. Now I know I don't have to strive for what I already have in Him.I thank God for giving Bob George the true wisdom to write these books.I recommend his ""Growing in Grace"" as well."
4,Very clear and wonderfully cut,This item came to me super fast and in perfect condition. It is flat on the back which makes it ideal to hang in my window. The way the crystal is cut captures and refracts the sunlight in spectacular colors and was larger than I imagined it to be. Very nice design and the price was awesome for the enjoyment it brings. I will buy again.
5,Danny Elfman does it Again,"Danny Elfman does it again. Once again, master film-maker, Tim Burton, and masterer composer, Danny Elfman, blend their trademark styles together seamlessly. Danny's haunting music combines perfectly with the gothic feel of the movie. Some of the best tracks are ones that have the ghostly boys oratory singing. The track, ""Into the Woods"" is a beautiful and mysterious song, combining sweeping violin themes and a haunting voice of a female singer. Perfect for Halloween listening, highly recomended for Elfman fans, like me!"
4,My 100-word book review,"Dracula the Undead is an excellent and well-written sequel to Bram Stoker's Dracula and is mostly congruent with the original. Atmospheric scene-setting and sympathetic rounded characters add a welcome degree of depth to the Dracula story. Written in the epistolary style, as was Stoker's original tale, the novel nevertheless comes across as a little too modern at times, and has a few unconvincing moments but otherwise remains firmly in character. I found that the best and creepiest scenes were early on, in the Scholomance, the undead academy deep under the Carpathians. Read these if you dare, without succumbing to claustrophobia..."
4,"I'm a bit disappointed, as Beck predicted...","...because I was blown away by Odelay, and even more so by Mutations. There's kind of a snide quality in this album that refers to the 70s sort of the way Mutations riffs off the 60s. But I can't really listen to this album too much. I keep listening to Mutations endlessly, hearing more, feeling more, being amazed at Beck's musical genius and sense of fun.Now I'm worried because Beck has stated he hates the music of the 80s, which I don't. I disliked the 70s a whole lot more for the lack of inventiveness which Beck managed almost on his own to bring back into the 90s. But perhaps everyone else will disagree. That's cool. Just keep working, Beck. I'm 51 at the moment, and your stuff gives me hope in a rather dreary musical decade so far."
2,Just too wierd.....,"You know an artist has got the music press wrapped around his finger when you as a listener criticize yourself for not liking a Beck record. ""I must be SOOO STUPID for thinking that Midnight Vultures is bad!"" That's what I say to this one. Odelay was great, Mutations was very good, and this one.... Let's just say that I have given it 6 listens and it just isn't working for me. Must be my fault."
3,Disappointing Follow-up to &#65533;Odelay&#65533;,"This CD has a lot to live up to. ""Odelay"" is, without a doubt, one of the most original pieces of contemporary music of the last 10 years. I believe it compares favorably to any of the great rock recordings. Given this, it is difficult to listen to ""Midnight Vultures"" without comparing it to its ""older brother."" ""Vultures"" contains the same combination of rap, pop, rock, sampling, and dance grooves that graced ""Odelay,"" but without the same result. The underlying melodies and riffs are just not that strong. Unfortunately, even though I have great admiration for Beck, this is a disappointment."
4,Beck is definitly ahead of his time,"Nevermind the outwardly-odd cover, this album is close to perfection. IF you know and love Beck's previous work from Mellow Gold and Odelay as much as I do, be prepared for a treat. This is his best yet by far. ""Sexx laws"", ""Pressure Zones"", and my favorite ""Mixed Business"" are all classic Beck at his best: Folk rock with funky sound effects mixed in. And, as always, the beat is enough to get you going."
3,A little something for the kids this Christmas...,"Well, what can one say about this record really? It's so choked with hype that it's impossible to get an honest review from anyone. If you ask me (and most folks do), Beck sounds bored. Here's a neat trick for all you Velvet Underground fans. Get yerself a copy of the VU boxset, listen to the last song from disc four (""Countess from Hong Kong"") and then put on track nine from Midnight Vultures (""Beautiful Way""). pretty nifty, eh? This album gets three stars because it's got a hidden track. Mr. Hansen, please stop with the hidden tracks, it got old after Odelay. There's only one thing left do now...give the finger to the rock and roll singer as he's dancing upon your paycheck."
4,Proboscis Up the Sleeve,"It is my professional opinion that Beck, with each new album, falls deeper and deeper into a whirling vortice of insanity."
4,How to tell if Midnite Vultures is 4 U,"After hearing Sexxlaws on the radio several times, I decided to buy it. I have been a Beck fan for several years now. If you're a Beck newbie, you should buy Odelay. But anyway, Midnite Vultures is a powerful set, but without all the variety shown on Odelay. This album is cranked up and party-style. The way the instrumentals are arranged is amazing, though, and if depressing music isn't for you, this is some premium stuff from America's favorite beat-crazed wordy rapping guy."
2,O.K.,"This album is not as good as Mellow Gold or Odelay. It all sounds the same, there isn`t any creativity to it. Hopefully this is just a phase."
4,It Grows on You,"When I first listened to this album, I was really dissappointed it because it was so different from all Beck's other stuff. However, as I have listened to it several times since, and every time I do I like it more. It's one of those albums you can't judge on just one listening. Give it a chance, and I think you'll say the same."
4,3rd Best Beck Album,"ALRIGHT! Now here's some good beck! At least you can hear the recording unlike some other beck albums.My sister says that she likes ""Debra"" and apparently he dosen't play it at his concerts any more. She's mad about that but her husband has this cd so she should be plenty happy.But anyway bottom line GOOD ALBUM!"
3,basic principles of the 18th and 19 century composition,"service was good, price reasonable and condition of book is as well as can be expected"
5,One of my favorites,I love this book; one of my favorite books and the best of Debbie Macomber. I've read it half a dozen times. I keep taking it back to the used bookstore thinking I've read it enough and then in a few months I go back and pay $3 to buy it again. It's a great story.
4,Really A Good Book,"A little bit of romance, mystery, sadness, reality all rapped up in a feel good story.Yes it's not a unique story it's been repeated numerous times... he needs a caregiver for his orphined neice and nephews she needs love...but it was unique in that it is modern day Mail Order Bride story with a slight mystery.Travis was moody and Mary was to nice in my opinion. The children: Jim (12) had way to much attitude he needed more attention or a good counseling session wouldn't have been a bad idea, Beth Ann was way too in tune for her age and at times you wanted to put a sock in her mouth but she was adorable and Scottie was just too grown up for 8. It was an abstract family that somehow worked because of all the issues they each had.I enjoyed Tilly and Logan's character's. He was sooooo in love with her and she was such a lost soul you wanted to get them together soooo bad.The ending was a good one but still not exactly the way I wanted it to end but all in all it worked. Enjoy"
4,Mixed emotions,"My feelings for this album are torn. On one hand, I am a devoted fan of the roots reggae, which to me is the true Bob Marley. So I can see how some people think this album is distorting Bob's legend.However, I see this album as the artists showing their respect to Bob, which is cool with me (I'd want to do the same thing). My hope is that this album introduces people to the power of Bob's vibe, and that it sparks their interest so that they go back and listen to his original works, which to me are more powerful than this album."
4,Fresh Sound to A Legend,"I sit here writing this review while listening to ""Legend"" for the 1000th time. As much as I enjoy some of the redone tracks on Chant Down Babylon they just aren't able to move me like original Bob Marley tracks such as ""Waiting In Vain"".In all fairness, four songs ""Rebel Music, Johnny Was, Turn Your Lights Down & Jammin"" were really well done on the new ablum, and have grown on me as I continue to play Chant Down Babylon.Rastafarianism is a lifestyle and religous belief and I have a hard time accepting the sincerity of some of the hard-core rappers singing Bob's songs. I can't help feel that for them it's more about the money, and not the true message of Bob Marley.With that said, I would still highly recommend this album to all true reggae fans."
5,a nice mix of old and new,"This is the album that mixes today's hip-hop flavors with the original king of reggae music. By using a combination of hip-hop beats and the original music, this album will become one of the hottest record's of the year. Bob would be proud of his son's masterful work on this tribute album, bringing more notariety to the marley name, for today's generation."
1,Shouldn't get so much as one star,"This is the worse quality TV produced. It does not get in anystations, only static and a screen that continuously jumpsand has lines going through it. The sound is distortedto the point of being inaudible.I have a small 2.5 inch Sony that is clear, wonderfulimage, sound ... reception. So I know small TV's can beviewable.If you want a portable TV, save your money. If you planon using it for a game monitor, it might be okay. AlthoughI did not try it."
3,Good maglite,Its a good mag-lite. Solid as can be. Top quality everything but now that LED technology has become so good there is just no comparing. This flash light just isnt as bright as the newer LED models. It is definetly worth the $6 more to upgrade to the mag-lite LED 3D cell flashlight (same exact flashlight but LED).
4,Not like the good ol days,I love this show but I don't know when things changed from 22 episodes per season to only 9! Bring back the good ol days I say.
2,Not That Impressed,"I'm not as pleased with this show as others here. I normally love this type of format, but, found the acting weak and unbelievable.The star can be facing certain death and give you a ""ho hum"" I'll be fine because I'm so cool...performance. It is very irritating and I just struggle to like this show."
5,Good fun show.,Good fun show. Not academy award type. But it surely is entertaining.Season 2 is even better. Can't wait to own it on Bluray.
5,"King, this case is closed!","Great video and sound quality, much better than I had dared to hope for. This is the holy grail for Sergeant Preston fans. Just buy it!"
4,Great Series,It brings me back to a time when there were a lot of fun and wholesome series on Saturday morning TV that appealed to youngsters.
3,Good add-on to set,"This set is a good add-on to the Micro Machines set. The pieces work well, although the pieces to put the ground part together are challenging for a younger child. My son loved the pop-up part of the land, and uses it for his micro-RC car obstacle course now."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Although the release date of the box set is Nov. 1999, it actually consists of 3 overrun CD's from 1994,1995 and 1997. One of my CD's actually still had a ""Tower Records"" price tag on it.Overall, the CD's contain average to below average trance, IMO. If quantity over quality is what you want then go for it, but if you prefer to spend your money on better, more recent music look elsewhere."
5,A very thoughtful work,"This documentary, Consider the Conversation, is essential to watch and re-watch. We live the heart of our lives every day, yet often the time that our vision becomes crystal clear, is during our last chapter. Consider the Conversation Documentary validates the importance of pondering all the options we have throughout our lives and to share our thoughts with those we love before we are surprised to find ourselves on our last chapter.There are so many segments of it that I found personally valuable. The clip by the woman about HOPE was both brilliant and accurate in my experience. The feature of the young man describing how others guide him through ""what comes next"" in terms of life events, until...a time they no longer do.For your library, I recommend this documentary without reservation. You will want to watch it more than once, because there are so many little gems sprinkled through this lovely portrayal of what can potentially be a sweet and precious time."
5,Surprising & Fun,"So there I am, at the cd store, debating on whether or not I should buy this cd. So then i'm like, ""Screw it."" and buy it. And I'm glad not be disappointed, cause I usually am. This cd is one of those great fun cds you have a blast listening to whether your driving or in your room or at a party (Screw it, i'd rather play it at the party)The best songs on here are, ""Jacob, Miz, Moon Lake Village, Friday Night, & Pictures."" The lowest point in this cd (Not counting the weird ""Love Song"") is probably their backstreet boys cover. It's weird and it does sound like the real thing, their voices and stuff. But overall, great fun cd if your into pop-punk, this is what i'm talkin about, this aint any boring disapointing pop punk cd, it's very catchy and good, yep."
4,Great CD,This band is really down to Earth and they are really talented. I have seen them live and they are great. Moper is one of my fav's!
2,Not recommended,"Cheaply made, as the price would suggest. The legs don't move freely when you release the leg locks; they bind and have to be pulled out. The most annoying thing is the absence of a quick-release plate. I was planning to use it as a cheap stand for an off-camera speedlight, but I'm pretty sure it won't even be useful for that."
3,Not Exactly Like Picture,I was a little bumded when I opened the box and found the spreader did not look like the spreader in the picture. It was a wooden oblong ladybug and not the three ladybugs you see in the picture. Other than that it was great for the dip that we had at out party. Giving three stars for false advertising.
1,Terrible pots!,"I was so unhappy with these pots. Everything I made in them burnt, I thought there was something wrong with me... till i got new farberware pots - for cheaper!"
2,Not what I expected,"I first heard Rufus doing an interview on PBS radio. He played Voodoo Child on the Cello. It was incredible. I bouht the CD and was very dissapointed.Nothing on it remotely sounds like Hendrix. It is mostly ""way out"" thype stuff with weird singing. But that's just me.Tom ""the Bomb"""
3,Old Television Series Western,This it a large Wagon Train DVD Set. Sixteen Discs in all. Each episode has a now famous guest star. Many of them when they were just starting out their acting carriers. Brings back plenty of memories of when I watch this series when it appeared on TV growing up. This is a great DVD Set for anyone who enjoys Old TV Classics.
4,Beaver Nelson has become a father,"The songs on this cd are less ""Sturm und Drang"" than on his former cd's ""The Last Hurrah"" and ""Little Brother"".Sometimes I think I'm listenig to kindergarten songs. Well, what the hack!I wonder what's the influence of ""Scrappy"" Jud Newcomb (former Loose Diamonds-member).Beaver can write very sensitive songs. He touches me inside.That's why I ordered all his cd's."
2,"Good stones, Poorly made",The jade used is very pretty. But the clasp won't close properly and it falls off all the time. I wouldn't buy it again.
3,"Eeeh, if you got the 1st 2, might as well get the third.","I guess with sequels, the blood tends to thin in originality and story line but its not so bad but to keep up with the first 2 and the comparison will make you see the favor in why they ended up stopping at 3 if im not incorrect but still, i enjoy watching the candy man, because of the other 2 and the over all, thats my reasoning for buying it, i hadent seen it before i ordered it so if im displeased or if its okay, that was the risk i took, the product is in good condition and the shipping was fast, so no complaints in that department, thanks."
2,It shouldn't of been made,"WHat started off as a cool horror film has dwindled down to a cheap slasher film. THe candyman is back hunting another decendent but in essence he is more like an ghostly stalker. He still wants to take her back to the grave with him and in teh process rip up a few bodies while he is at it. THis sad piece of work leaves little to the imagination and instead leaves you weeping at how pathetic it is. Thsi time his power is in his paintings which need to be destroyed in order to kill him, right. Hollywood will pobably ...out some new entry soon enough. Avoid."
1,0 STARS: THAT WAS SO LAME! LMFAO THAT WAS SO LAME!!,"I will not give ""Candyman 3: Day of the Dead"" a serious analysis because it is so stupid and to be frank, is not even worthy of a review other than to say that this TRASH sucks just like the rest of the series, but also, this movie goes above beyond being horrible and is the epitome of the word ""lame"". THIS MOVIE ""F""ing SUCKS!!! Please pardon me for my language, but after watching this movie, I am sure you can understand my distress after wasting my time on this complete and utter rubbish."
5,Will?,Will this memory card fit in the normal memory card slots that come in the playstation 2 game cases...???
4,Mad Catz memory card,"It does the job. I bought one from a local toy store just to test the theory of slow save and load times some people has been complaining about. I found there was a difference, but not so much that I wouldn't save the five bucks to put toward another game."
3,great tribute,"I normally hate Springsteen tributes, but this is amazing. Into the Fire and Atlantic City are both incredible.I don't know what the other guy is thinking."
1,"Oh, believe me, ONE is too many. . . .","This is the most bogus piece of propaganda I've had the misfortune of stumbling across in a long time. Makes me wonder which agribusiness is behind this one. I will never cease to be amazed at the shamelessness of some people. Need I remind ""mad dog"" Avery that -cid (as in pestiCIDe) comes from Latin and means ""killing"". Somehow this seems a little incongruous in a sentence with words like ""saving"" , ""environmental"" and ""triumph""."
3,"""Woodstock""?","Upon the 25th anniversary of the legendary music and art festival, this box set was released, fooling all who purchased it by the use of some rare nuggets.What this box set must be viewed as is not a sprawling, enthusiastic representation of the greatest cultural event ever, but instead must be seen as a strictly nugget-filled trinket that just happens to include tracks that were featured in the festival.Here, you get never-before released recordings of Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Band, and many others. However, with these gems you must also suffer the misfortune of not hearing the stage announcements or the famous ""rain"" chant. Even some of the original, authentic crowd noises have been forced to reside with crowd noises that were clearly recorded somewhere else.The Box Set succeeds in giving you a few handfulls of nuggets while simultaneously failing by taking away the spirit of the original recordings. Proceed with caution."
2,"OK code, poor writing","Even though some of the exercises in this book are very good, it was hard to get past the poor writing. This made a lot of the book confusing and unintuitive - not great for the reader when struggling to learn. I also was saddened, after buying online, to find only one real application in this book, a blog. I was expecting a lot more out of so many pages - ie: to learn more than one thing! This really took away from the book overall. I think a lot more planning and effort should have been put into this book, instead of this seemingly lackluster attempt."
2,Not Recommended.,"It is not the best book out there about Flash Applications and how to code in ActionScript. Disadvantage of this book is it only discusses one flash application from beginning till the end, which is developing flash message board. Most of the time you cannot keep track of what they are talking, so when you cannot follow what they are talking your message board also gets stuck... It is written in boring style as well. I would recommend Phillip Kerman's ""ActionScripting in Flash MX"" for those who want to learn programming in flash."
3,What Happened?,"Guns and Roses returns after years of being in the bargain bins. This CD has all of Guns and Roses at their best from Welcolme to estranged. The music is great and it makes you realize why this band was so popular but, the quality of the recording is terrible. This cd sounds like what live cd's sounded like in the 70's. I would expect more from Axl. What happened did you forget how to record music? This is the same guy that caused a riot because the sound man could not get the music to stop feeding back in concert and Axl stormed off the stage. I think I will stick to the studio music. Hopefully, the next cd will be better."
4,Good Compilation,"There's still a part of me that misses Guns n' Roses. These guys had the potential to be one of the best rock bands ever, but like so many, fell into mediocrity. This is a great snapshot of their reign at the top. Hopefully their rumored new stuff is good. I don't mind a change in sound, I just don't want a complete departure from what made these guys so edgy and good."
2,WAY BELOW EXPECTATIONS,"This cd is by no means worth the money. The perfomance for knockin on heaven's door featuring backing vocals is depressing. Some of the songs were taken from the Illusion Home Video (live in Tokyo), which is old news. If you're looking for old raw GNR, you better try a bootleg."
3,Good for dancers,"This video is good for people who like to dance to get in their cardio. It is not very hard, and I ended up not sweating very much so it is probably good for beginners."
2,Not so good for diving back in,"I've done a couple of other videos before and after having to sit out a while due to various things, I picked this up because it looked like something I could do, have fun with, and get some exercise. Not so much. As some of the other reviewers stated, the steps are called out right before she switches to them and they are not demonstrated. If you have a background in dance (like maybe you were drill team or a cheerleader) then you will probably breeze through this, catching on quickly and really enjoy it. For the coordination challenged, look elsewhere. I may try the Biggest Loser video I've got, or I may go back to Kathy Ireland - I can actually follow those. And I KNOW you want something that's challenging - if it's too easy it's not a real workout, right? But I need something I can actually DO, rather than marching in place trying to figure out what the heck is going on.....(Next day: not good for bad knees either!)"
4,"Fun, Effective Workout","This is one of the most fun workouts I've done in a long time. I love the dance portion (she moves quickly with little explanation so you just kind of have to jump right in). Luckily there is enough repetition of the moves that even a novice dancer can catch on. When I started getting down the moves I was having a blast and actually caught myself smiling a few times! How often can you say that about a workout? The pilates portion of this tape is excellent, too. Really great moves that I could feel firming and toning my body from the first few seconds. This is a fun and effective workout that I would highly recommend."
4,"You Do Good Work, Reba",Very Good! Can not wait to hear it all the way thru. And I really like the added features such as the screen saver . Thanks John B.
4,The woman with a wonderful crowd stopping voice !,"A working singer that is sexy with out all that glamor, like some other country music singers are today. She had the most powerful voice that is close to Shania Twain. With this album it shows how much of us woman are ambitious and strong if we put or minds and guts into it. Deffinetly a must buy."
1,NOT GOOD TOGETHER!!,"If all the music forces got together to make Reba and them sound ""So Good TOgether"" they failed miserably. I found this to be a waste of time and money!"
5,Best tasting gag gift ever!!!!,"What is more thoughtful or caring than the gift of spotted dick? C'mon, even a sour puss can't keep a straight face when a case of this stuff shows up at their door! (For the record as far as tinned spotted dick goes, Hienz is by far the best!)"
1,Tastes like wet fruitcake to me,"Very odd product. Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils. Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.Taste wise - in my opinion, tastes like soggy, wet fruitcake (not in any good way at all). WAY TOO SWEET and I even got a few bites with a sandy, gritty, crunch texture which was horrible and I can only hope it was from the raisins?!This product is not pleasant tasting at all so I am just not sure about all the other great reviews. But for my taste, I couldn't choke down even a few bites of this stuff. Only thing I appreciated from this was the few laughs from friends/family over the name of this Heinz product."
2,this is one dick to pass up on,"Look at some of the main ingredients: Partially Hydrogenated Canola and Palm Oils. This stuff may taste sweetly good, but the hydrogenated oils wreak havoc on your body. You'd be a terrible hostess poisoning guests with this stuff. Well, unless you have very bad guests :P"
3,Get off the Politics,"I have to agree with ""A Music Fan."" I cut my industrial teeth with Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Frontline Assembly, and KMFDM before most current-day want to be fans and Marilyn Manson were potty trained. This is a good hard effort, but the typical brainless anti-war anti-Bush rhetoric is juvenile. I've never been inclined to take my political direction from strung out rock stars and have made an attempt to separate the 2-dimentional views from the music. In light of the current global situation and maturity, this is more challenging than before. As such a good effort is rendered much less impressive."
2,Tedious,"I once loved this band. For many years musically they just NAILED it, deftly straddling the line between heady, spacey electronics and heavy guitars and jackhammer beats. And their lyrics still had a sense of irony or humour about them, or they were simply inconsequential, a small piece of the larger puzzle. But this one...where to start ? NO hooks. NO subtlety. NO variety. NO sense that it was created for any other purpose than to bash George Bush. As another reviewer here noted, I neither need nor do I want to take political advice or direction from a burned out junkie musician, even if I DID agree with him. Listening to this album is like going to family Christmas dinner and having to listen to that one crazy ranting uncle that no one likes but puts up with anyway. It is THAT tedious."
3,Eternal show tunes,"Some songs are poorly copied, meaning that they're ""scratchy."" In this day & age I always expect masterful, digital recording. Hasn't been the case lately.Keep a sharp eye out as to how it was transformed from the original to the new.Lot's a ""great greats...."" however, should have been about $35.00 not in the $50.00 range, not for this lack of quality.Worth the purchase if you're a lover of priceless show tunes & money isn't an object.Enjoy!Suzanne"
5,If You Love Pratchett and the Diskworld...,"I think you'll like this movie a lot. It's shot on a limited budget, but they make good use of their resources and put on a great show. If you are expecting Peter Jackson-level effects and visuals, you'll be disappointed-- but I was more concerned with how they got the story right and if the actors fit the images in my brain. As such, I enjoyed seeing the characters come to life-- they did a great job of casting the roles. Usually film adaptations of books I love disappoint, but I had a lot of fun watching this movie. The soundtrack is lively and wonderful. I loved how they brought the Clacks to life visually."
2,Alright if you haven't actually read the book,Sadly the movie while maintaining a passing resemblance to the book has lost most of the humor and added a large amount of content that was never in the book and actually detracts from the story.It's too bad really.
5,Going Postal the movie,We really enjoyed this film. The detail was amazing and production values were spot on. The actors chosen also did wonderful jobs portraying the various characters. There were some changes from the book but the over all story was very close.
4,Fun to see Pratchett brought to life,"My wife and I have been Terry Pratchett fans for many years and own many of his books. We enjoy reading them to each other on long car trips. We love the mix of humor and fantasy that he brings to every selection. It's been fun watching his books brought to life on the big screen. The Color of Money was entertaining but ultimately they didn't have the budget to pull off the book. Going Postal however, is pretty true to the book and the acting is first rate. It is an exceptionally fun movie for any fans of Terry Pratchett and I highly recommend it."
5,Viva la Causa,"Do you or does your child know where your food comes from? No, I do not mean in plastic wrapping in pristine supermarkets. This book tells the ever-important story of those people who do backbreaking labor, hour after hour, day after day, for basic wages (and sometimes not even that), with few benefits most of us take for granted. Although the book tells of the founding of the United Farm Workers Union, the issues of social justice facing migrant farmworkers remain as current as they did a century ago. This is a book every school child and parent should read. This book tells of the conditions that led Cesar Chaves and his wife, Delores Huerta, to organize and found the United Farm Workers in the face of considerable personal danger and against strong odds. An epilogue and afterword tells of the contribution of Chavez and the union, along with the challenges these largely invisible people face today."
4,I use this book almost every day,"I appreciate that many people will be buying this because it has been endorsed by the Society of Actuaries. My review is for those who aren't being compelled to use the book in exam prep. I find ""The Science of Uncertainty"" to be the most consistently useful of the statistics texts in my office. The examples are clear, it has the right equations, and it's well organized.Some people here are complaining of inaccuracies but they provide no examples and, frankly, I've never noticed a problem.I like that authors provided an appendix explaining how to manipulate the distributions they discuss in the book using Mathematica. This was not new to me, but I can imagine it would save others some headaches."
2,Don't get it,"The things they do explain are explained ok. BUT, they only cover the basics. Like conditional probability. They'll tell you the formula and rant about it a little and that's it. The formula they give is not the one you can always use. Often times it can get very complex and long. None of that is mentioned, showed, or explained. Or when they talk about jumps in 4.1. They never really tell you what it is or how you recognize it/get it. It's vaguely explained and you need to consult other sources. The author must be thinking everybody is a math major. Covering the basics is NOT enough. Hugely disappointed in this book. All the other chapters are the same. Often times I try to to the practice problems and can't even find where they talked about it in the book... because they didn't."
5,A beautiful CD,"I love this CD. Enrique puts so much emotion in his songs that it sounds like hes singing to you. Since this was my first time getting ANYTHING by him, I didn't know how it would turn out. I'm VERY glad I got it. I love all the songs, but my favorties are ""Rhythm Divine"", ""Be with you"", ""Ritmo total""-spanish version of ""Rhythum Divine"", and the best track on the CD (to me) ""Could I have this kiss forever""-his duet with Whitney Houston. They sound SOOO great together. Its a pretty song. PLEASE buy this CD. You WON'T regret it!"
5,enrique es lo maximo,"I have to say enrique's music is very special to me. The lyricsto his music espcially in this cd, have pulled me through somerough times. I listen to his music every morning on my way towork, I have every Cd he has ever made. I can relate with everyword in his songs. His way of expressing himself in his musicis so sincere and so special. What a way with words.....Youare the best Enrique."
4,Pretty Good Stuff,"I like this CD a lot. Not a WHOLE lot, but enough to listen to it often. Many good tracks, and only few complaints. I enjoy hearing my favorite singles sung in Spanish, but there are so many of those remixes that it detracts from the English version. I don't like comparing the two, but it seems that I am forced to. Also,it is kind of overwhelming- one half is English, and practically the second half is the same songs, but a different language. Few people pay SUCH close attention to lyrics that the latter version would sound radically different. All in all, I have to say that I like to listen to this- I just wish that it were just a bit more musically varied."
5,Love my Pot Rack!,"Limited kitchen storage space prompted me to look at pot racks. My kitchen is on the small side with low ceilings. This limited my options. This is a beautiful pot rack, holds my very heavy pots and pans without a problem. I don't think you can beat it for looks, style and service. It arrived quickly."
2,Cheap plastic,"These all-plastic scissors can't cut construction paper. Even while working really slowly and carefully, they rip the paper and the result is unsightly. It didn't handle normal paper that well either. I should have put a few extra dollars and gotten something metallic."
2,lots of good actors,most of whom I never saw since I gave up after 10 minutes. Maybe I should skip ahead to the last 10 min & find out.
3,Johhny Depp?,"this is a very trippy movie!! either you will love it or hate it. It skips around alot, hard to follow sometimes"
1,Stopped working as well after 9 months,The iron worked well the first few months that I had it. But maybe after 9months or so I noticed that it just didn't seem to work as well. I thought it was my imagination or that maybe i needed to work smaller sections of hair at a time. But after about 9 months i was using the highest heat setting and tiny sections of hair - and it still isn't doing the job. My hair stylist used her Chi on my hair recently and I remembered what an iron is supposed to work like. I would not recommend the Sedu.
2,Not worth the money....,"When it works, this does work well but they die out pretty soon. I have bought two of these flat irons and both of them died out within a year. Same problem with the cord that other users have been reporting. For something that costs $115, you think we would get a much more sturdier product. Yes and it does get very hot on the outside. So be sure to stay away from the area where the plates are."
3,Des wonders but lacks durability!,"I would say that this iron does wonders for your hair. I purchased the iron 3 years ago and had no problems until recently. I admit that I dropped it maybe twice. In terms of durability, I would not trust it. I had the electrical power problem. While using the iron at different angles to curl my hair, power would continuously turn off on it's own making a lot popping noise. I can't use the product anymore and now have to order a new one."
1,Died After 1 Year - Same Problem with Cord,"This iron does a good job straightening hair with minimal hair damage. However, after one (1) year, the iron wasn't getting consistent power because the swivel cord connection wouldn't hold. Now it has stopped working altogether. I never dropped it; it appears to be a problem with the design. For this reason, I can't recommend it."
3,This is what you call rave,"Well I've heared everything and anyhting . But this, well if your a real raver don't waste your time . I have an idea go and find Trancemater 2000 and than you well see what raving is all about."
2,Disappointing,"Although this product works great, it does not last very long. After a couple (two) of uses it broke from the base. After a few more uses it broke in half. I use several shaving products from this company and really love their other products. I expected much more considering the price and I definitely expected more from ""The Art of Shaving"" company. The only reason I didn't give one star is because the product does work well, but I imagine you need several on hand in the event that one breaks."
4,My review,"Grip 3 pc Kitchen Door Router Bit SetI haven't used it yet, but it looks well worth the price."
2,Saving my money,"Thanks to Amazon.com I can save my money (sorry Amazon.com). I have the first incarnation of this disc, and that is all I need. I was able to listen to the three new tracks, and only one is a keeper to me, ""Mary had a little lamb."" The other two, while fun, have bumped other good songs off the original album. If Garth had added these three new songs to the existing disc, I might have purchased it as a replacement. But since he cut out three great songs to add on good one and two so-so tunes, i'm saving the cash."
3,Decent,"Go straight past the ... who wrote the one star review and enjoy this album. Once again, a release that is just for a nice holiday entertainment has to be bashed by some mindless reviewer who just doesn't like Mr. Brooks. Will this juvenile, moronic, hateful behavior ever be stopped?. This is a nice album and Garth sings very well. Obviously. You know that. Ignore the one star review at all costs."
1,fell out of bed,well it looks like garth has fell out of bed this cd is at number 960 on this amazon.com chart and that is great i dont like his music his popularity is on the wane his last 3 cds you buy for a song and garth is expected to sell or giveaway 6 to 7 million cds for each one he makes so im sure that the brooks camp is not to excited with his lp sales as of late so give it up garth thank you
1,this is your second xmas cd garth,if i could give this no stars i would truly trash but what can you expect from the worlds biggest phony i recommend RINGO STARR I WANNA BE SANTA CLAUSE instead now this is true xmas music
3,Average For CSN,"""After The Storm"" is a very average CSN album. The songwriting and performances are all good, but they do not match up with the best stuff these guys have done. There is not much that really stands out here and not much that really sticks with the listener. The high points are few, with David Crosby's ""Camera"" being the best cut on the album. Stephen Still's guitar playing is another bright spot and he really lights it up on several of the tracks. Overall this is not a bad disc, but far from essential."
3,Maybe,"First I must say that I have only listened to one song on this cd: I miss you. I have listened to every song on every Cd by incubus and this is perhaps my favorite song by Incubus. Hearing it played by someone other then Incubus was a bit strange. THe string Quartet did a beautiful job, though. I think they captured the esscence of the song as well as anyone who is not Incubus can. Incubus always puts so much meaning into their songs and Brandon Boyd sings with so much truth. Because of this No one can perform an Incubus song to the degree of an original. This is a nice tribute but i would not buy this cd. I believe that only Incubus should perform Incubus songs. THey are so amazing that any attempt parallel their performance will always fall short."
3,"Good workout, though not what I expected","The program seems a bit like it was produced in the 90s. The girl who teaches acts like everything is quick and easy to learn when some of the steps, I think, require a little more teaching and practice time. Once you've learned all the moves, you get to put them to the music from the movie, which is fun. You can get your heart rate going pretty well, so I'd say it is a good workout. I just felt like the production quality was a little dated."
2,Just okay,"I think I just expected something a little different with this DVD. It wasn't bad, but nothing super special about it."
5,I am a fan,"I have read this entire series on my Kindle and bought the first few books for my mom for Christmas. The characters and locale are unusual and I have found all the stories interesting. There is a lot of fascinating information about a region with which I was unfamiliar, the swamps outside Tallahassee. The viewpoint character is a middle-aged college professor who spends her spare time scuba diving in the area's spring-fed caverns--lots of interesting details about cave diving--and assists the local sheriff's department. The books are well paced and absorbing, and give a strong sense of locale: I have come away from each of them feeling refreshed, as if I have been out of town for a while seeing somewhere new."
4,A little levity where levity is due,"Some of the other reviewers here are a little harsh, and a bit humorless. I wonder if they'll approach child rearing the same way.Anyway, I didn't buy this book because it's uniquely humorous or marvelously scientific. In fact, I think there are clear disclaimers on both regards in the first pages of the book.I bought the book because the approach is light and friendly, and sometimes rather clever.If you want a medical education about pregnancy, this is not your text. If you want side-splitting jokes, this also is not your book... try something by David Sedaris instead.But if you want a less serious book about a topic that is all too serious, and if you want to gain some insights from an everyday guy, then this book is worth checking out."
2,Not helpful... kinda funny...,"I am one of the suckers who bought this book for my husband. We read the first couple of chapters together and quickly found out that the a) the author thinks very highly of himself, b) there's WAY too much build up for a not very funny punchline, and c) my husband knows more about childbirth than the author and this is our first child. Save your time and money."
5,Great information,"We found the information and thoughts in this book both relevant and useful. It was a great communication tool for us, telling Dads everything their wife and baby will need from them. A must-have for first time parents."
2,Very basic,This book is a very basic short guide to defensive living. It's basically about increasing your awareness of your surroundings. It does not go into detail about tactics for defense. It is a very General guide.
3,Good Introduction,"The book covers most of the important issues, however, it does not give adequate detail on any of them. If you want a broad overview of those things you should consider, this is a good place to start. If you are looking for specifics, you will have to follow-up this book with several others that contain more details.The focus is on awareness and avoidance. Discussion of firearms only makes up a small portion of this book. For those interested in pursuing self defense firearms, Dave Spaulding's Handgun Combatives would be a good follow-up book to read.A high point is the short discussion on night shooting. This is the first book I have seen that gives clear pictues of all the generally accepted methods of holding a flashlight and a handgun at the same time.Worth reading if you are starting to think about what you can do to enhance your personal security."
5,"now that i own it, it's even better!!","""Christian Rap""..i think it's still a contradiction in terms,but this group has given me a chance to believe in it yet again.the rapper is really quite good, and his rhymes are top-of-the-line.if you're even looking at this review, it's probably because you've heard at least one song off here.and if you've heard at least one, buy this and give the whole cd a spin.if you don't like something...you just might on the next track.jam on,- Henry"
3,Too Much Talk,"I've read most if not all the Honor Harrington books. Over the years, they've become more about long discussions regarding politics and less and less about the action. Weber does a fabulous job with his action scenes, but he really needs to cut back on the lengthy discussions regarding politics.There are scenes in this book where groups of The Bad Guys get together to discuss their bad plans. The scenes will go on for pages and pages but don't actually advance the story by taking so long. These scenes could be a half page. Crisp and clean.If you don't mind skimming 10 or 15 pages at a time, waiting for a conclusion to the scene and for something meaningful to start, this is still a good book. But I had a hard time wading through large sections of the story."
1,"I quit halfway through, I was so bored","I've been a huge fan of David Weber for years, so I really wanted to enjoy this--it had my goodwill from the beginning, but I only made it to around page 215 before giving up, it was that boring. I couldn't invest in the characters, I didn't care what their problems were, I couldn't take any more discussions of the intricacies of politics. Maybe this would have been better if it were about half to 2/3 of the length, but as it is, it's 960 pages. On the positive side, though, there's a scene with Honor Harrington (in the first chapter) which ruled."
5,very practicle,I gave this as a gift and the receiver was thrilled. Arrived boxed and in good condition. Nice for when the power goes out!!
3,not for terriers,"I was thrilled when my dogs really liked playing with the balls, though I had my doubts about how rugged they were. A few hours passed and they were still engaged, though intent on removing the continents from the surface. By day 3 they claimed victory and I had to take them away, before they ate any more pieces. However the core of the ball was intact. I think these are great balls for less focused chewers."
5,Orbee is the Big Dog,"Planet Dog makes a great product. The best in the business! My dog loves the Orbee world toy. This is the second Orbee world for him, and the 5th Planet Dog toy."
1,Fell apart in 20 minutes,My little 36 pound dog had this torn apart in 20 minutes. The outer raised up pieces were pealing off in her mouth. I had to throw it away.
5,Great mic,"We use this microphone in our Bluegrass band ""Sloughgrass"" and it has been a great workhorse for us. Very versatile and rugged."
1,Wrong Tracks on CD!,Hello? do u know that half the songs arn't even on this cd? the real ones aint even good anyways. check up on the real songs before you spend you bucks on tracks not even on this cd
5,kicks,"this cd just flat out whoops up on other various artists cd's. There isn't a bad song on the cd. Just buy it now, there's no thinking about it."
2,Vestal death investigated by vulgar sleuth,"The author of this book, and the Corvinus series, uses modern dialogue to tell this story set in ancient Rome. Corvinus is a 'vuglar Nick Charles (The Thin Man)' type of character. I simply could not get comfortable with the use of f*** and s***, which are peppered throughout the story. Other overused words include - pal, yeah, uh-uh, okay, right ( as a substitute for yeah). Out of place phraseology include - catch you later, vertically challenged, you've got the ball, and no how, no where. The use of modern dialogue is a distraction and doesn't fit the Roman purple-striper persona.This genre is much better handled by Davis, Saylor and Roberts."
2,"""Remastered"" is a joke ....","I bought this original cd release and the recording quality was HORRID. So I bought the ""remastered"" edition and if it is any better at all, it was undetectable to these ears. This was obviously a lousy recording from the get-go, so do not waste you money on the remastered version. The only possibly worse CD release (audio-wise) is Neil Young's ""Harvest."" What a shame."
1,BUYER BEWARE --- MOVE OVER ANTIFREEZE ~~~~ NEW NASTY,"I wish i would have heed the warnings from other shoppers! I've NEVER left a product review before BUT I HAD TO FOR THIS ITEM... I wasn't until the third day of giving these to my Bestest buddy that I realized they were not agreeing with him... I know, bad daddy..Old Iron gut met his match. Price shouldn't really be an issue here - yeah they are cheap (never again) but Id like to know what they put in them to make them desirable because once its gone - illness sets in. ONLY BUY IF YOU WANT an ill looking & miserable pet. I am not even going to keep them around to send for a refund - bad bad bad.WARNING - TREAT AS POISON ***** WARNING *** DO NOT FEED"
5,open book to an emotional-core song writer,One of the few albums that I can truely say is flirting with perfection. Ben's words cover everything that I have felt but have'nt had the courage or the passion to write down. The music is beautiful and it will change the way you look at all other albums you own.
5,Very interesting movie,"Very very good movie. Interesting and intriguing plot, Robert Redford plays very well and Sidney Pollack's direction is fantastic in my opinion. I watch this movie once a year."
5,Best Film Ever on the CIA,"Of all the films I've seen on the CIA, ""Condor"" is the best, including ""The Parallax View"". Superb performance by Redford and savvy direction by Sydney Pollack. ""Condor"" captures both the tenderness and depravity of this high stakes, life-or-death universe.There is a fascinating relationship of Von Sydow's Old Europe assassin toward Redford's hunted, harried character: a mixture of cold-blooded detachment and true affection.Perhaps the best exchange is between Redford and Cliff Robertson's CIA case officer who almost justifies the senseless murder of Redford's office mates. Redford intuitively recoils from Robertson's argument with this rejoinder: ""Boy, have you found a home."""
4,Just as timely as ever,"I first saw this movie back in college. Thought it was entertaining butno real social relevence. I was wrong. This movie speaks of the Now. Would the U.S. actually invade another country to aquire Oil? Would we use another excuse like WMD, Terrorists, Liberating a middle eastern country? Send 4000 members and counting to thier death becaus of OilI think the answer is YES"
4,Good but not a full story,"Three Days of the Condor is a simple story. Secret agent bookworm comes back to his HQ to find everyone dead. A hit that was supposed to get him as well. He quickly discovers that it's his own government out to get him. So what does he do? He kidnaps a beautiful woman and forces her to help him, who quickly falls in love with him, as he tries to figure this one out. That's the basic story. What's missing is the bigger picture. The movie starts off to abruptly that it takes a while before we get a clear picture of just who Redword's character (Condor) is, what he does, and why this is significant.The movie's saving grace, ironically, is the assassin who is sent to kill Condor. It is his view on the situation, and Condor, that really makes this an interesting movie. If only Redford wasn't a real life communist he'd make some exceptional spy thrillers."
4,Also a gift,"Gramps wants another gift, but unlike the previous, this movie is a good one, including a performances from an all star cast. If you are paranoid, maybe you shouldn't watch this one, but if you like spy movies or thrillers, then ignore the age of it. This is a good movie and you will enjoy it."
4,Don't exceed the concentration,"These work great, and don't cause streaks on the windshield like I've found with the Rain-X solvent.- Don't exceed the concentration recommended too much - I did this because I did not have a gallon sized container to measure the water in, and over several refills, I found the reservoir developed a very strong sulfur smell. I've not had the issue since draining and refilling with closer to the recommended concentration."
3,A bit much,"This toy is a bit much with the lava effect, not to mention it is a royal pain in the behind trying to attach both pieces to the base. I actually had just the front piece attached at one time, and after looking at it without felt it was a much stronger piece. I love the Obi Wan sculpt itself, but have issues with this pose and base. No where near as cool or easy to display as the General Grievous, for example. Wish it would have been better."
4,Nice little comp!,"As nice a little 45-minute rockin' blues comp as you're likely to find. Maybe nothing new to it, but well-put-together and all the tracks complement each other. Where it's from 1994, the sound is quite acceptable, but not the same as you'd find if it were newer. Other, similar comps may be bigger and yes, better, but this is always a fun listen. Sound clips over on AMG. Cool, kind of old-school cover art, too."
5,Ecstatic! to find a long lost favorite!,It was wonderful to find an item I used years ago and had been unable to locate lately. The Diamond Deb nail file is without a doubt worth searching for. I was very pleased with the product and the timely way in which I received same. I will certainly order from this source in the future.
1,"I already rated this product AND AGAIN: ""IT DOESN'T WORK""","I already rated this product and because I rated bad the product, the company tried to bribe me by giving some money back if changed the rating I gave before. I won't change my rating, because this helps consumers take a better decision based on OTHER customers (as myself) experience, and changing it would be against my principles. STOP bugging me, I won't change my mind, you can keep your money."
4,A good guide for a great place,"This book is a WONDERFUL resource! I was raised in Idaho, and it contains places even I hadn't heard about. The book details many of Idaho's beauties that the locals normally know about, but a visitor might not notice or be aware of. It isn't the most in-depth place to find information about neat places in idaho, but it is a ""must read"" for people who want to make their visit to Idaho special and unique."
5,The BEST 'Charlie's Angels' book ever!!!,"Without a doubt, this is the best written book on the classic tv series ""Charlie's Angels"". It is fun to read, very informative and very accurate. I could not put this book down, it was a great help during the 'Charlie's Angels- Angel Heaven 24-7' marathon last week on tv land. If you are a fan of Charlie's Angels, THIS IS THE BOOK TO HAVE!!!! Forget the rest."
5,"The Best, Most Entertaining Book Ever About The Angels!!","Jack Condon's well-informed casebook is definitely the best book ever written about ""Charlie's Angels."" Full of fun, excitement, and lovely photos to commend. The foreword written by the ""most angelic of them all"" Jaclyn Smith is truly outstanding. Here's an actress who's key to success in hollywood came from the show that was critised and maligned by the critics then and yet still proud to tell the world that she's an angel--and she really is!This is a must to all the fans and for the new generation of fans, this is the book for you to see what you have missed. A truly, collectible item!"
5,"""The Case of the Best Angel Book""","Being a HUGE television fan I was thrilled when I got this book. It's all there, too! All the ins-and-outs of one of the top rated shows in the mid-seventies. The authors have done a wonderful job researching the history of a show about ""three little girls..."". This is a MUST have for any serious t.v. fan or simply the person who would like a very nice stroll down memory lane."
3,Works with modification,"Used this to install an aftermarket unit in a 1989 Ford F250. Plugs fits ok, but pins are not held tight so you have to be careful or you'll bend the pins when you try to plug it into the vehicles harness. Wiring info on package did not match vehicle; I'm pretty sure the package info was wrong, because the truck is bone stock with a factory stereo. Anyway it's pretty easy to pop out the retainer that holds the pins into the plug and move the pins around, so it wasn't that big of a deal."
3,not for upgraded stereo,"Would have been fine but it wasnt for my car, I needed the blaupunkt stereo adapter which ended up being an audi/volkswagon harness. Would have been helpfull if it was stated in description."
5,Classic olympic video game!,"Nagano winter Olympics is a very good video game. I played it when when i was very little. The new winter Olympics game for the wii reminds me of this old one. It has o.k. graphics but is very fun. Lots of cool Olympic games. Including my personal favorite event, bob-sledding. Buy this game at it's low price now. Trust me."
1,"Service ok, product not so much.","I received this cartridge one week after I ordered it - average time for shipping.I installed the cartridge in my fax machine - would not work. The fax machine could not recognize that there was a new cartridge installed. Upon inspection of the cartridge, I discovered why. One end had been damaged when it was refilled with toner.I contacted amazon and my email was forwarded to the company. I received a reply soon after and my account was credited for the full purchase price of the toner.Final review: Customer service - good. Product - bad."
2,Excitement? Thrills? Look elsewhere!!,"The only thing that saves this movie from putting you to sleep are the 2 main stars, Alyssa Milano & Ice-T. There isn't any storyline that hasn't been done before & as for twists, the only twists in this movie will be your stomach churning from feeling like you've seen this before."
3,NICE LITTLE ACTION FILM WITH A CLEVER ENDING,"DANIEL [JUSTIN THEROUX], WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND [ALYSSA MILANO] VISITS HIS FAMILY FOR THANKSGIVING. BUT DURING DINNER, A VICIOUS GANG OF THIEVES [LED BY ICE-T] BREAK INTO THE HOUSE, KILL OFF DANIEL'S FAMILY, AND STEALS HIS FAMILY'S ART. BEING THAT DANIEL AND HIS GIRLFRIEND ARE TRAPPED IN THE BASEMENT, THEY MUST FIND A WAY TO ELIMINATE THE KILLERS. NOTHING SPECIAL, BUT IT'S AN OK LITTLE ACTIONER. WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END IS TRULY SHOCKING."
5,Worthwhile,What a lovely book! It is inspiring! It offers insights and guidance for creating a home and rooms we love to be in. Highly recommended!
5,Great Deal!,"The 2"" x 3"" self-locking bags were exactly as advertised, they are good quality, they arrived very quickly, and the price was excellent. I would definitely by this product again from this company."
5,Well Worth the Read,"I requested and received this book for Christmas and finished reading it within just a few days. Tho I never really heard much about Daniel Pearl or his wife when he was missing and his death was announced, I thought this book might help increase my understanding of what is going on in the world...and it did that. It was also a very warm and beautiful love story. This book is one of the best books I have read in the past couple years. I will be buying more copies for my grown children as I know they will appreciate the book also."
1,Analog Controller,"I don't understand why companies sell accesories that aren't made by their own manufacturers.For instance,the whole reason to buy a Dual Shock 2 controller made by Sony is so it will look good with your PS2 and won't break.(usually the case)3rd party controllers do not go with your system and sometimes break so you will have to eventually buy the name brand.My recommendation,spend the extra couple of bucks and get the best quality."
1,There should be jail time for these kind of writers,"Yeah, great book IF you already know all this stuff. As a technical writer by profession I would use this book as a first draft to begin to create an understandible presentation of IIS. This is filled with ambiguity unless you know IT administration from way back...For example, the author romps through setting up a website using a wizard. Fine. But ""hello!"" am I supposed to know what the permissions are that I am setting up? For whom? For the website visitor or the FrontPage author, or what??? As it turned out I was locking the pages from editing by any FrontPage users. Great.Yeah, a fine book for the inner cult. But no concept that someone might be setting up a dedicated server as a ""mom and pop"" ISP. I finally punted and called Microsoft... We finally figured out the problems and I can guarantee you it was nothing that this book could have helped with... The only thing worse than confusing software is ambiguous technical writing about it!"
1,not even worth a laugh,"I will make it easy for you:At one point the author quotes ""The Rover"", in particular the line ""I used to rock it sometimes I'd roll it..."" and does his best to determine the evil significance of the words ""rock it"" and yes, ""roll it"".Not even amusing in a sarcastic light but a complete waste of time and money.In recent years Jimmy Page has become a patron of ABC Trust (Action for Brazil's Children Trust) donating his time, energy and money to help Brazilian street children so i encourage you to spend your cash wisely.Or you can buy ""Fallen Angel"" and allow a self-admitted drug casualty to explain his true meaning of ""rock it"" and ""roll it.""It's up to you of course."
1,In the simplest words....,"...this book is a joke.No serious Led Zeppelin or Rock & Roll fan should ever have to lay their eyes on this text.500 pages of baseless, delusional, and repetitive garbage that tries to convince all that ""Led Zeppelin is THE DEVIL"". If you are looking for something serious about the band and its members stick with books like ""Stairway to Heaven"", ""Whole Lot of Led Zeppelin"", and ""Magus Musician Man""."
1,intolerance and the waste of paper,"It's hard to believe that someone can still write things like that in the 21st century or so. In the end. this book revitalize the satanic legend about Led Zeppelin and Jimmy Page and becomes a great advertising concretion for Crowley's books, some of them hard to find and not even known by the masses. When will be the right time for free music and free artistical, philosophical, religious expression through the world? And don't even think that there are serious researches behind these 600 + pages!!Magic is a work of committment, for those who believe in it.So, dear Friend (author) let the people alone, and you, potential reader, don't buy this chaos of citations!"
5,The ABSOLUTE truth below!,"I have a 20"" Wega. I turned on the PS2 (Red Faction was in it), wired the SVideo input and the RF input to the TV at the same time, and switched between them by changing the input on the television.NIGHT and DAY. More than any other console, the PS2 with this cable running SVideo looks about twice as good - clean delineations, almost no color bleed, and totally in focus. It is super dramatic.Trust me, I've done the same with my XBox, Gamecube, and Dreamcast... seriously, the PS2 improves DRAMATICALLY with this cables's Svideo connector, more than any of the other consoles.Again, I did this on a WEGA... maybe an older TV will look blurry no matter what you do. But based on my results, this cable is a no-brainer for anyone with a PS2."
2,Only for the Completists,"Buy this book only if you are one of those people that have to have every appearance of the TMNT. Unfortunately I am one of those people and am pretty disapointed with this book.A previous reviewer mentioned duplicate pages and while that is true...the action is so poorly presented I almost didn't notice. But as a TMNT fan who bought this product as a completist I was most disapointed that Casey Jones and Raphael are afterthoughts that are only bit players. Almost like they are in the way of the story that Eastman wanted to tell. I guess to his credit the story in this form is simply called ""Bodycount.""Don't buy this unless you cumpulsively have no choice to."
3,Pop-Up. For kids.,"Book is best suited for kids 3 1/2-6 yrs old (old enough to know who TMNT are, young enough to get a kick out of pulling the tabs on the pop up pages). A little confusing as it obviously is summarizing a longer more complex story --heavy on action/movement, because it is a pop up book."
4,Good Kids book,This book was a good way to remind kids of the true meaning of Christmas. The artwork wasn't my favorite though.
2,save your $$,For me this book is just not worth the money and had I been able to check it out at the library for a preview I probably wouldn't have bought the book.
1,ick!,"This book was not at all what I was expecting. I was hoping for something that would keep the magic of Santa alive while still realizing that Christmas is a celebration of Jesus' birth. The book was pathetically simple minded and I was appalled at the pages which compared Santa's wearing a red suit with Jesus' wearing of red, i.e. the blood of his crucifixion - this is appropriate for my 7 year-old?! I sent it back immediately."
4,A Crushing Tale,"Simon Clark writes stories that always entertain, and with Darker he does so smashingly. It seems that an invisible force exists, an entity of pure power that can be conjured to do ones bidding, if all the conditions are met.""...it can be controlled but it can also be unleashed.""An interesting premise fleshed out by a story chock full of chaotic scenes of amazing brutality makes for great late night reading.""Nothing can stop it and it must be appeased.""What price for power? To rule the world anything is subject to sacrifice.Clark is one of the most consistently enjoyable authors working today, buy everything he writes and revel in money well spent."
3,A bit disappointing...,"This book starts off with a bang, but doesn't sustain its pace. Before long, we're swept up into an endless, repetitive chase during which a lot of people get gorily squished by an evil Beast. Meanwhile, a transparently evil villain manages to charm the pants off an incredibly unsuspecting family, while plotting to use their innocent four-year-old daughter in his nasty plot to rule the world...Clark writes well, and he's created an especially engaging character in teenaged Rosemary Snow, but this rather thinly plotted book starts running in place long before its climax."
3,darker,"This book starts real slow. The back cover of the paperback states that a stranger ""pounds"" on the door of the Young'shouse. This happens around page 100 of the paperback. Just when I started to put this book down and go on to something else...BAM!It really gets going. Then it slows down again....BAM! Here we go again. You'll love Rosemary Snow. You'll want to strangle Joey for his stupidity. Certainly a mixed bag."
2,Overated and Overpriced,"Unfortunately Kodak seem to spend a small fortune making their Disposable Camera's look Sleek and Trendy. However the Photos always turn out very Average despite being loaded with so called High Quality Kodak Max 400 Film.IMO Kodak Max 400 Film is one of the worst films on the Market.I used the Kodak Max HQ a couple of times and was disapointed with the Photos. Grainy, Washed out Colors.I've yet to try the New High Definition Film, hopefully this Film is slightly better."
3,"Well, after all it is only a One Time Use Camera!","I was going to a Birthday Party on 15-Nov-02 and decided to take this Camera with me. The Photos turned out a bit Grainy in some shots with not much Colour. Also the Skin Tones looked a bit Pale. I used one of these Cameras last year but it was the ""Kodak MAX"" One time Use Camera, those pictures turned out better. Unfortunately they have Deleted that line (Well in this country Anyway) of One Time Use Camera and replaced them with this new Kodak MAX HQ Model which I don't think is as good."
1,Misleading Cover,"This book has a gorgeous cover and leads you to imagine the most beautiful interiors of shops, shingle homes and the harbor but the interior of the book has very faded old photographs of dated interiors. Thumbs down for me... You decide."
3,Mediocre; Great potential...,"Erin Bode is often compared to Norah Jones, but this comparison is flawed. Norah Jones' songwriting is superior to that of Erin Bode's sophomoric meanderings. This record could be so much better. Bode's appearance on Fox News piqued my interest due to her band's ability to create a smooth, atmospheric jazz background to her sultry crooning. This record finds her voice thin and unconvincing. It would be better served by an electric piano or organ; the guitar won't cut it. Jones' lyrics are delivered in a straightforward manner with excellent, mellow backing tunes. Erin Bode should take note. So should the producers of this album."
2,Great album,"Brought this for my wife and she really enjoys it. If you like Norah Jones you'll like this, sexy,jazzy, well done!"
3,DECENT OUTPUT FROM EX KITTY,"The Stray Cats have continued on and off with some reunion tours, its members have pressed on. The most notable might be Brian Setzer and his, again, bloated big band albums. But while Setzer has been in the spotlight on occasion, Lee Rocker has really never strayed from what the Stray Cats were all about. If you need any more proof, just look at the back of this disc, where he is holding a standup bass over his knee and plucking the hell out of it. The latest release from Rocker is what you would come to expect from someone who only knows rock and rockabilly and how vivacious the genre can be when done right."
1,Eight the passerotto is far better!,"8 the passerotto is far better than this! Don't listen to Genesis, buy 'Latte e i suoi derivati' instead! Furio De Nardis"
3,Dissapointing,"Because alot of reviews said this is the best Genesis album ever recorded, I decided to pick it up together with Nursery Cryme.I am really lucky that I played the latter first, because otherwise I would never have listened a Genesis album again. The number of memorable melodies can be counted on one hand. The only 2 songs that I can really listen a couple of times in a row are horizon's and time table.The epic supper's ready suffers from the same thing. Eachtime there is beautiful instrumental work, and than Gabriel starts to sing his lyrics, and suddenly the track isn't fun anymore.The Hacket showcase horizon really saves this album for me."
4,Good Prog Rock,"Alot of people are only familiar with the Phil Collins-led Genesis of the 1980's, who were pop music at it's worst. If you hate that band, don't be swayed away from giving this version of the band a listen. The group from this time was led by Peter Gabriel and there is nothing on this album that comes close to sounding like ""Invisible Touch"" or the like. What you get is some of the most way out there prog-rock of the 70's. Gabriel voice has such emotion and fragility and Steve Hackett's guitar playing is intricately woven in and out of the songs. Tony Banks' keyboards are the backbone of the record and Phil Collins' and Mike Rutherford's playing is competent. While many songs can be called ambitious, ""Supper's Ready"" may define the term. In it's 22 minutes, it weaves together 7 song movements and is the defining moment of the band's career."
4,Supper's Ready is worth the album!,"The album as a whole is boring but when you get to Supper's Ready, be ready! The whole song is 22 minutes plus. The concepts flow together beautifully and there are deep thoughts and clever phrases!"
4,Horizon's Bright,"I owned this album, and I love it. Phil Collins' drumwork is splendid, as is Gabriel's lead vocals andBanks' synthesizer work. I especially love Hackett'sclassical nylon solo on ""Horizon's"". A must-have forGenesis lovers."
4,Back Saver,I use this cart to transport my bags that average 25lbs each from home to work. It seems to be holding up well so far. The price is well worth the savings on my back.
4,luggage cart,The photo of this product needs to be updated because it does not match the delivered product. The photo shows bungee cords with metal hooks to attach to the handle. The delivered product has adjustable straps with a plastic hook to attach to the handle. My old one lasted 8 years with daily use 10 months out of the year. I am concerned that the plastic hook will not last as long.
3,"A good read, but not a great book","I enjoyed the book, and I'll probably keep my eye out for more books by this author. The background was well enough researched that I never was pulled out of the story, the main characters were interesting. I particularly liked reading a historical novel were the people were not historical characters, but lived about in the middle of what was possible economically in that time. I also liked the mystery and how Bak went about solving it."
5,A GREAT CD,I love the Manhattan Transfer. I have their Anthology CD. But this CD is special. In my opinion it is a must for anyone who likes this type of music.
2,Somnambulistic,"The opening track, Let's Hang On, written to be sung by a man to a woman, is re-arranged for a man/woman duet in a way that destroys the meaning of the lyrics. The instumental portion is bland-ified in a way that is also completely out of touch with the original. And the rest of the CD goes downhill from there. It comes off as a bunch of hits arranged so as to be ""safe"" enough for the playlist at a smooth jazz station, and it just puts me to sleep. Not anywhere near the calibre of other Manhattan Transfer recordings."
4,"Beautful, wistful, lovely","I resisted listening to BTFABG for years. And when I did hear them, it was completely out of context, just a random track here & there, so I wrote them off. What a mistake! I'm glad I came back to them and gave ""Halo Star"" a listen.They remind me immediately of the old Dead Can Dance. Where DCD went deeply into experimenting with period and culturally specific instruments, this album still retains that otherwordly quality that I fell in love with all those years ago that DCD embodied so perfectly.Each song flows into each other softly and smoothly. There's nothing scary or disjointed about them at all. The album itself transformed me to this sort of dreamy aural landscape. It's like a personal soundtrack to your own independent film all about you!It doesn't surprise me that BTFABG has not and never will hit the mainstream. In a way, I hope they don't so I can keep them as a precious secret and dazzle the uninitiated. Don't you?"
4,Squeaky Clean jewelry,"Works so well that it CAN shake the diamonds right out of the setting!... Be sure to use the plastic basket...I had a baguette fall out of my wedding ring ($130 repair, cause I saw the stone and took it with me)...and a marquee diamond loosened from another band...($65 repair).... Very expensive to have jeweller repair your items... So far, my diamond earrings, 2 sets of two, have no incidence or loosening...Cleans chrome razor handles, hairbrushes, watch bands, and almost any other sturdy item that is difficultly crudded up, long as it will fit in the basin tub... Uses plain water to clean, if desired add one tiny drop of shampoo...rinse after use, wipe clean with a dry towel...I would buy again, but stress the importance of stoned settings being placed in the plastic basket that comes with it...I use the device once every two months on average"
3,This was pretty good,This book gives a basic information about love and sex by the numbers. It offers you connections between every number combination. A fun book.
1,Adds to the negative perceptions of single-parent families,"Don't buy this book! Negative in tone. I want to tell my child how much I love our family, and why our two-person family freedom and bond is so special, NOT that ""darn, I wanted to have a co-parent to help, whine, moan, it's so hard for both of us."""
3,For the collector,"I'm torn here. I am a fan of Yes, especially this period of their development.I have most of their recent (1990's and on) albums. These recent live albums draw from this early 70's repetoire so I wanted to hear the 'original' versions. While the musicality is outstanding and what I expected, the sound quality is poor: very thin in the midrange with imbalances between instruments. It's not as bad as a bootleg recorded through a trench coat, but considering the quality of other live recordings from this era, they could've done better. The sound quality is better and song lists identical in the recent CD's- with just a slight erosion in performance (these guys are now in their 60's!). So if you're a collector, absolutely add this to the pile. If you're just curious about Yes, start with the recent stuff like the 35th anniversary recordings (CD and/or DVD). Either way, they still blow current bands off the stage and deserve their place in rock history."
3,A Live Remake Of The Previous Three Albums,"In most cases the studio versions are superior to these live versions, so you only need this if you must have everything from Yes during this period...not that there's anything wrong with that. However, what you really want if you want live Yes is the early BBC recordings by Yes!"
4,Fantastic introduction to the subject,"This is one of few college textbooks I've used that has actually HELPED me learn the course material. The book takes you from the basics (DNA structure and replication, etc.) all the way through some very complex concepts while never missing a beat. It's surprisingly readable and student-user-friendly whether you're a beginner or a certifiable gene jockey. My only complaint is the quality of the figures; some of them are very small and thus hard to read, and as one reviewer commented, they are sort of simplistic to the point of not being very thorough. Having full-color illustrations would be a big plus.Overall, this book definitely surpasses other bacterial genetics books I've seen as far as readability and organization goes. It delivers what it promises!"
5,Great wipes!,"These cleaning wipes are a great way to clean the vinyl in your car. It moisturizes well, and leaves the vinyl looking sleek and smooth. The wipes in the container stay surprisingly moist, and there are plenty to use in multiple cars, multiple times. I would recommend these wipes to anyone looking for a quick clean for their car's interior."
4,All Hits.....But No Rarities!,"I have enjoyed listening to Stevie Wonder over the years and I was very happy to buy this! However, I do feel this is more of a ""4-CD greatest hits"" album than a box set. A box set should have lots of rarities for the hardcore fan. You should get this if you don't have his music on CD (perhaps the purpose for this box set?). The good news is that both the pictures and liner notes are superb. The discography is complete with chart entries. Overall, you will enjoy this box set."
5,AT THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY,"ALTHOUGH I GAVE THE ALBUM 5 STARS I HAD TO COMBINE RECORDS FROM ""LOOKING BACK"" AND OTHERS TO GET THE TAPE RECORDING OF SOME OF HIS LESSER KNOWN RECORDINGS. I THINK I LOVE HIS MUSIC AND COMPASSION FOR THE HUMAN RACE THAN ANYONE SO I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT HE NEVER TOUR MEMPHIS,TN. I DO THINK THAT WHOM EVER MAKES THE LIST FOR SONGS TO BE ON THE ALBUMS MISSES THE MARK WHEN THEY DON'T INCLUDE ""PURPLE RAINDROPS"" AND ""WITH A CHILDS HEART""."
4,A Great introduction to Connie Mason,"Gabriel Wellsby, The Marquis of Bathurst is robbed the same set of highwaymen twice, what he does not know that ""Ollie"" is in fact Lady Olivia Fairfax, a woman who has be for forced to due so to keep her brother in school. When Bathhurst and Olivia the fireworks start, but Gabriel is a man hiding a lot pain. Pain infact that might the lovers apart forever.""The Rogue and the Hellion"" was the first book that I have read by Connie Mason. And it was really good. Ms. Mason gives the readers strong characters with good plots. The only reason that I didn't give it fives stars was that Bathurst's subplot seem to take a little long to reslove itself."
5,Best playhouse available!!,"I received the playhouse today, and couldn't wait to take it out of the box. It is SO adorable!! I am not very talented in the putting together dept., but I had it together in no time. It is very, very easy to put up. My granddaughter, will LOVE it! If I get in, I don't know how easy it will be to get out though. For small children. This is a toy, that is worth buying!"
1,NEVER RECEIVED IT!,"I would have loved to receive this product, but I was shipped the wrong item and the problem was never resolved. Certainly not good customer service."
4,VERY HAPPY!!!,We bought this house for my 13 month old Son. We picked this one due to the colors are very Non-Gender related. My Son LOVES this house he was in it while my husband was putting it together yelling at him like Hurry up Daddy. It was very easy to put together we had it up in less than 30 minutes. Great features with the doorbell and mail slot and phone. Wish the faucet clicked together with the sink better though they really need to rethink that. You will need a electric screwdriver or Drill because if they had predrilled holes the screws wouldn't grip in the plastic very well. I worte this due to so many complaints on that because we found that not a big deal.. But all and all Very cute and fun house. Hope this review helps.
4,Still Cookin' The Blues!,"Tinsley Ellis has truly grown better with the years! From the earlier concerts that we attended in the '90's until today - he and his band members have a fresh and accessible sound that never fails to grab your attention. This album is well crafted with 12 first rate tracks, among which my favorites are ""Early in the Morning"" and a fantastic cover of ""Mercy Mercy Mercy""."
5,MY WIFE JUST LOVES THIS,MY WIFE JUST LOVES THIS IT LETS JUST IT WORKED GREAT POWERFUL ENUFF TO DO THE JOB ????
5,"Great songs, great remastering job!","This is a great collection of 18 songs by Steppenwolf. It includes all of the ones on the now deleted ""16 Greatest Hits"" and I think it includes all of the songs on ""20th Century Masters"", so this is a better collection than either of those. This includes the unedited vewrsions of ""Magic Carpet Ride"" and ""Monster"". One flaw - I would have made room for ""Power Play"", since I prefer it to several of the songs that are included.I can't think of any classic rock that needed to be remastered more than the Steppenwolf tracks, nor can I think of a remastering job that was better than this. The tracks sound fabulous! The bass is great and everything is clear. The vocals don't seem loud enough, but that must be how the original tapes are."
3,classic,I feel that there were other hits off Steppenwolf than what is on this CD althoughI have still enjoyed listening to this great music.Cd arrived on time in perfect condition.
5,Nice Collection,"I ordered this CD last week after seeing the band for the first time, although I'm not a new fan. This CD contains all of the band's hits plus a few I don't remember. One of my personal favorites is ""Hey Lawdy Mama"". There are no live cuts here, nevertheless,fans in search of a good greatest hits collection should be pleased."
3,missing text in eBook edition???,"Great book. Seriously great book. But the opening story of chapter three is ""not available for the eBook edition."" Chapter 3 is predicated upon this story, and I have no idea what the story includes. How in the world can one small piece of the book not be available?? Ridiculous.Add an extra star for the print copy but keep it at three for the kindle edition."
1,The most evil song ever written!,"In the early 1990s, a singer called Shanice made a recording and a video of the most twee song ever written - ""I Love Your Smile"".Hell is room with ""I Love Your Smile"" playing over and over again 24 hours per day. I think most nursery rhymes have more ""edge"" than this or anything else Shanice sang! Let's hope she has retired from music and is doing something else with her life, God bless her!"
4,Good replacement,"I have a Compaq computer that came with Win 98 which I bought back then. My floppy drive died and I bought this one as a replacement. It has worked well and without a single problem, I recommend it.There is one problem, though. The Compaq tower prevents the Eject button to protrude comfortably. I can stick my finger inside to push it and eject the diskette, but I prefer using the upper end of my pen. This isn't the fault of the Mitsumi and it isn't an annoyance."
4,Vegetarian B5 option,"While Source Naturals does have 5 extra ingredients, it is a vegetarian B5 option. The Swanson B5 sold at Amazon has only 2 extra ingredients but one is gelatin made from animals. If this is important to you, maybe consider Source Naturals. I did some quick searching and it looks like sorbitol has the worst side effects of the Source Naturals extra ingredients."
4,Good set of small tools,A good set of small tools. Does not have every small tool you may need but a good start.
2,Poor Capture Device for Money,"I have had this device for a few weeks and I am returning it ASAP! I bought it to capture old training videos for work and found that the audio and video are out of synch too many times to make it work messing with. I had such high hopes for this, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is interested in taking videos from VHS to DVD without the use of some video editing software. I spent hours correcting the video and audio synch problems in Premiere!"
3,PRIMO Adjustable Bed Guard Rail,It is sturdy and easy to use but it is not as tall as I had hoped or expected.
1,the pot calls the kettle black,"In the last month, i've heard about the ""jimi hendrix of the ukelele,"" the ""jimi hendrix of the accordion,"" and now Kaki King who claims to be the ""jimi hendrix of the acoustic guitar.""Please, how about letting Jimi Hendrix rest in peace.Kaki King is no Jimi Hendrix. She is a watered down version of Preston Reed. All this talk of Kaki King being original is utter nonsense. If you listen to all her music, and take away what was ripped off from Preston Reed, you're left with music that puts you into a new age stupor - the very thing Kaki King so arrogantly says about the music of other solo guitarists. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!I'd give her time - a LOT more time - before she figures out how to sound like herself. I've been listening to solo acoustic guitar all my life, so I know that of which I speak. Kaki King's music is weak, unoriginal, and oh so verrry New Agey."
3,Prog rock at its prog-rockiest,"Come back to the mid-70s, when art rock bands were at their most ambitious, and many would say, pretentious. But, like Pete Townshend, I never liked that word. These were the days when Phil Collins was merely a drummer, and Peter Gabriel was the guiding genius behind the band. This is a double album about....something, but damned if I could ever figure it out. The music is sometimes inspiring and beautiful, as in the title cut; catchy, as in Carpet Crawlers and Counting Out Time; delightfully weird, as in The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging; and oppressively tedious, as in most of the rest of it. Gabriel's voice is, at best, sometimes really not so terribly grating. But if you'd really like to hunker down for a whole afternoon, perhaps with some kind of psychologically altering substance, give the whole thing a listen."
5,Genesis at their peak,"From the first note played until the last is struck, this album is pure genius. It is, by far, the best Genesis album. I feel Genesis was building toward this masterpiece with their previous works 'Selling England by the Pound', 'Foxtrot', 'Nursery Cryme'and 'Trespass'. The album has beautiful continuity and it is hard to listen to one song individually. Once you start this work of art, it's almost impossible not to listen through till the end. One of my all-time favorites. I think Gabriel left at the right time, as this would have been very difficult to duplicate or exceed this brilliance."
5,Easy,"I bought this from the flea market. They copied it for me. The song I love the most is ""easy"". The whole CD is a hit."
3,Almost ideal,"I am a die-hard funk fan from back in the day, so I idolize these guys. But I have to say that any Commodores compilation that doesn't include their masterpiece ""Painted Picture"" isn't worth the time it took to press the product. That being said, I recommend any 2-CD set of this band's music instead."
1,Mastering blank discs and German rather than Italian,"I can't speak to the quality of the lessons in this set because I haven't gotten so far. The first copy I got had a perfectly functional disc 1, but the rest were either blank or corrupted. After returning it I got discs that worked, yet disc 2, although labeled ""Mastering Italian Disc 2"" actually had the files for ""Mastering German Disc 8"". I won't be trying a third copy, since I'll probably just get a nice set of jellies instead."
5,selling genesis by the phil,"is it possible to enjoy any of genesis' music after peter gabriel left? i submit that it cannot.....puhleeeze.....invisible touch? land of confusion? mama? i can't dance? wow, how big of a compost heap of songs can one man produce? where are are you now?"
5,on every prog head's all-time list,"You have to have this album even if you are a prog head that doesn't really appreciate early Genesis (unthinkable). ""Selling England..."" has ""Dancing with the Moonlit Knight"" and ""Cinema Show""....enough said. Steve Hackett's ghostly guitar work never sounded better, Phil Collins sings harmony vocals throughout the entire album (including the entire song ""I Know What I Like"". Every member of Genesis shines on this release. I really enjoy ""Firth of Fifth"" with Steve's majestic guitar solo. Yes, ""Battle of Epping Forest"" is quite wordy, but I'll take this anyday instead of ""Sledgehammer"". A prog list for all times should include ""Selling England"", but don't forget ""In the Court"" by King Crimson, ""Passion Play"" by Tull, ""Close to the Edge"" by Yes, 2112, etc. etc.....This album is Genesis at the height of their progressive powers. Buy it today and wear it out.....so very Britissshhhhhh, love....."
5,*The* Prog-Rock Masterpiece,"Ah, yes those were the days... Peter Gabriel dressed up as a Christmas tree, hordes of long-haired shaggy students in Afghan coats, clutching albums with only three songs on them... This record stands out among its contemporaries (Yes, ELP) and even other Genesis albums, because it has it all; fantastic music, humor, moods, melodies. It is a veritable roller-coaster ride of prog. Great stuff!"
3,"Good, but no ""Nursury Cryme""","I must say this album to me is like a follow up to ""Nursery Cryme"" in a sense that is is a more pale version of the album since it really goes nowhere, I listened to is expecting to love it like ""Nursery Cryme"" but it just would not do it for me, if you want a great Peter Gabriel Genesis album I strongly recomend 1971's ""Nursery Cryme"" not ""Selling England by the Pound."""
2,Phil Collins fan,Simply didn't care for it. Only 1 or 2 tracks really stand out. Trick of the Tale is much better.
3,Very aerobic oriented,"This is not a bad choice if you want some quick aerobic exercises, but I had hoped for a bot more on the strength training side to balance it out. I will use it but probably only sporadically."
3,Over the top intense. very little direction,Alot of people told me about Denise Austin. I have been using Leslie Sansone Walk at Home. The daily dozen is short and intense workouts. She offers very little instruction and is difficult to keep up with. I ordered several of her videos. The 20 minute workouts would be good if she would give you some warning when she is changing her moves.
2,Not the usual Denise,"I love Denise, but this is not my favorite of hers. Jumps around a little too quickly. Don't feel like I'm spending enough quality time on each area. My personal favorite for working everything is the Abs Diet 1 video."
4,Any more Denise,Last of the group I hope she has her fill. Each disc offers so much more than others. I am glad you have such a selection
4,Sound principles,Good sound healthy diet and exercise principles. I would recomend buying with the Daily Dozen Workout Dvd. It is much easier than just looking at the pictures in the book for the work out and doing it on your own.
3,Like working out with Barbie,"The workout itself is challenging and good but so help me, when I tried to listen to her instructions the first time through so that I would know what to do I started laughing so hard I almost suffocated. Death by workout. Denise is just a bit much for me to handle. I'm going to try to push through because I the workouts seem good and if I can just listen to the instructions a few times I could mute her. But oh man, it was crazy."
2,General low quality gloves,Low quality - tear easily. I've torn several just getting them on my hands.
4,Netgear FVS114NA ProSSafe VPN Forewall 8,This firewall was configured for a home office network (both Mac and Windows based systems) along with a router and DSL modem. I believe this installation was farily straight forward. Took a couple of hours to set everything up correctly. Had to assign everything a static IP address. Have not had any problems since.
5,Convenient!,All you have to do is plug your AC adapter charger into this thing and you have complete ease when it comes to charging your phone! Works great!
5,Going through?,"I bought this CD in 1998. At that time I was going through the most horrendous time. My life was filled with uncertainty, fear and strife. I listened to Chris' music on my way to and from work. I shared his musical message of Christ with many people. Every song covered another question and answer in my mind. My soul was soothed and fed by 'Cover Me' and 'Nobody But Jesus'. All of the music points in one direction -- up."
4,Chris Willis has a golden voice,"His voice is really beyond description. If you think of a cross between Peabo Bryson and Donny Hathaway, you'll have the general idea. Chris' approach is never over the top, but it's not passive either.The material is also very much in the high-quality mellow 1990's R&B; vein, without a dud in the bunch. The songs range from good to great.Combined with Chris' unique vocal sound and delivery, this makes for a set that has stood up well over the years and will continue to age very slowly.If you like male solo artists that deliver high-quality R&B; with inspirational lyrics, this is a set that you will enjoy."
5,Rowan is the Best Doctor yet!,"I've held the belief for the past 12 years that Rowan Atkinson would make a great doctor, and now I have proof on tape. I would love to see this series redone with Rowan Atkinson at the helm. His humor is always punctual and sharp. And true to Doctor Who form, the video is low budget and well written. I HIGHLY recommend this video to anyone who is 1) a doctor who fan or 2) is a Rowan Atkinson fan (blackadder, Mr. Bean). Don't miss out on this hilarious video. (I agree that it was a bit short, but for a comedy skit, that is expected)"
3,The way they were,"We all have to start somewhere and this first album from Yes shows a young band still grasping at forming their own sound. Thing is, they do all right here. The Byrds and Beatles covers are tarted up and given the royal treatment, with guitarist Peter Banks doing some nice lead work. Jon Anderson is still fumbling his way as a songwriter with his stuff here (""She stirs the sweetness with a spoon"" or some such claptrap), but on a couple of originals, ""Looking Around"" and ""Beyond And Before"" the band comes roaring out of the skies with great results. This debut album will never be remembered as Yes' finest hour, but it's a good start."
2,Plante-ing Pere,"This is not a book to cheer you up. It purports to be a family story, the occasional gatherings of seven brothers at the home of their aging parents. But there's no glow, no real sense of understanding. Instead it has all the pettiness of family squabbling, too many tears in general, and all the dreariness of old age. It's written in short, choppy, irresolute sentences. It's not a book you quit in the middle, anymore than you would leave the room when a somewhat tiresome neighbor comes to call, but - as with the neighbor - you can't help but be glad when it's over."
4,"Good session, but!!!! pity not Stereo and no 'Comparison'","This session is excellent and being familiar with original L.P. was hoping that C.D. would comprise the Whole album later released on 'Modern Music' with additional 'Comparison' included. Although inside sleeve mentions 'Stereo' - it isn't. Dont mind paying import prices but give us the goods, Please! Nevertheless the material is excellent and good swinging Stuff.John Cooper, Witham. Essex. (U.K.)"
1,"You've gotta be kidding, right?","Ok, after reading this onslaught of glorious reviews I cannot remain silent. I have been a GIANT Yes fan since for nearly 30 years. I have taken the brilliant with the not so brilliant and I have taken them happily. But I will not take Relayer. It is utter bile. The most nonsensical, masturbatory, overblown recording they ever made. I do not make such criticism lightly. I have, on many occaisions, attempted to re-evaluate the album. I even bought the remaster. Here's what happens... I press play and after 2 minutes I am laughing so hard I have to stop the disc. Try another track, laughter turns into complete disbelief. This record defies categorization. I would honestly rather listen to Union on repeat mode for a week than having to sit through Relayer once. Really."
3,Bad production and personnel changes rock Relayer.,"Is it just a coincidence that producer/engineer Eddie Offord was canned after Relayer? Plagued by lousy production, this was the first Yes album that was actually painful to hear. A high-end distortion evident on the mellotron and guitar passages was the equivalent of fingernails screeching on a chalkboard. This sonic mess has been cleaned up on the digitally remastered CD version, thankfully. As for the music itself, new keyboardist Patrick Moraz seemed to influence the band into pursuing a more dissonant, jazzier sound - evident on the intrumental sections of The Gates Of Delerium and Sound Chaser. The result? Moraz wasn't asked to hang around, either. It took two more years for the band to musically get back on track with Going For The One. Relayer has its moments (Soon, To Be Over), but cracks were starting to appear in the Yes armor - armor that seemed invincible just two years earlier with the huge success of Fragile."
4,Yes at the very top of the Prog Mountain,"This CD is quite out of the ordinary, even for YES. With Gates Of Delirium clocking in at around 30 minutes, it is one hell of a song, prog rock or not. It is a very meaty listen. Not recommended for children or republicans, grin. Very time changy, very complicated, and if you like this sorta stuff, this is a CD that will set you on fire. I like it, but it is not my favorite YES CD. Close to the Edge or Fragile even The Ladder or Magnification are the CD's I like better than this, but that does not mean it is a bad choice."
5,The reason why I love music,"The Gates Of Delirium, around the 17 min mark. Jon Anderson starts singning ""Soon, oh soon the light""... I've had this album for more than 20 years now and this very passage still sends shivers down my spine each time I listen to it. I envy those who will buy this CD and hear this song for the first time. This is the reason why I love music. Buy this album. If you don't like it, listen to it until you do. If you still don't like it, you're hopeless :-)"
1,Poorly transfered to CD.,"This is almost completely unlistenable because the quality of the CD is so poor. This is true of all the YES records. They weren't transfered to CD very well. Re-mastered versions have more recently come out. I haven't heard them, but this is not worth buying and, unlike the other single-star reviewers, I LOVED this record when I was in my early 20s."
4,Worth Getting,this is worth checking into.Even Though I'M not all that Crazy about His Voice this Brother Can Rock on Guitar.His Message thru his Lyrics are Hitting Home.He is One Of The Most Underrated Talents Out Here.He Comes Correct He Doesn't Front.A TRUE POET&Musician.
3,Who Review,"If you like The Who, then you know they're at their best when preforming live. This video is no exception. Although it's in black and white, and the sound quality is less than perfect, it does contain some hard-to-find-live songs from the Quadrophenia album. This video is for the hard-core fan, so if your a novice or new comer, this probably isn't for you. Collectors beware, video and sound are marginal so don't expect DVD/CD quality, but it's a good addition to any fans Who collection. If the analog to disc tranfer were done better, it would have been a 5-star production, but 1973 recording techniques leave a lot to be desired, and there's only so much you can do with a computer!"
4,dance by the light,My three-year-old daughter loves this book. She has had a fascination with the moon since she was old enough to notice it. She likes unfolding the pages and reads it to her baby brother. It is a cute introduction to the phases of the moon. She likes especially to have her daddy read it to her.
2,Small; story disappointing,"This book was much smaller than I expected (I bought the hardcover edition). It's about the size of my hand. The story disappointed me too. It starts out fine, but you're left hanging at the end. I don't think I'd have bought it if I had read it in the store.SYNOPSISMonica sees the full moon, asks Papa to get it. Papa gets long ladder, goes to moon. Moon is too big; moon tells Papa to wait. Papa waits until moon is smaller, brings it to Monica. Monica plays with the moon. ""But the moon kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller and finally it disappeared altogether. Then one night, Monica saw a thin sliver of the moon reappear. Each night the moon grew... and grew and grew..."" That's how it ends -- with a two page illustration of the full moon."
1,"Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me",The book was listed in like new condition. Some of the pages were tore and colored on. Several names were written in the front cover. It looks like a very used book.
4,Kindergarten memories...,"I remember when this book was first published, and my kindergarten teacher brought it into class to read to us during story time. I remember being enchanted by the fold outs and the idea of actually being able to 'play with the moon' like Monica did. It is a sweet story of the love a doting father has for his little girl. I highly recommed this book for any young child, in fact I was recently given this book for my 20th birthday to add to my collection of favorite children's books."
2,"Pay attention to the size of the book, only 1/4 as big as usual picture books of A4 size of paper!","The book is still good with imagination, fold-flip, but just way too small to feel the beauty of the images. In this sense, the price of 7 dollars is not worthy it at all."
5,"It's Only Rock and Roll But I Like It, Love It ,Yes I Do!","Whoa! This is a thorougly enjoyable book all the way through.I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer who stated this is ""One of the greatest rock books ever written"";it's certainly the best rock and roll book I've ever read, and I actually am not that much of a Stones fan. This book could have been done as a quick, tabloid rock tour journal, but the writing is absolutely superb and fascinating all the way through, the story decadently entertaining.Bravo Mr.Greenfield!"
3,A nice reference book,"Whew! Quite a lot is covered in this small book, but very little detail is given as references. As a skeptic myself these authors were 'preaching to the choir' with me. I think their idea that ""people who disagree with them"" will read and possibly change their opinions is a bit far-fetched. This book is perfect for those who dabble on the edge of pseudoscience, sometimes leaning one way then the other. This gives easy to understand examples, and some ammo to fight off unscientific beliefs.I would really have liked to see the authors use footnotes throughout the book as an aid to researchers. I know that they were right on with their claims, but would like to see where they got their information. The glossary was very helpful, and can see using it in the future. If you have a friend or relitive who is always bothering you with pseudoscience claims, and you never quite know how to explain your skepticism, then this is the book for you. Carry it on your person, always!"
5,"Temptin' , One by One!","This two CD package was heaven sent when released a couple years ago. I do think, however, that Motown has many many unreleased gems that could have been included here and are not. Case in point, Paul's magnificent ""Last One Out"" (w/ the Tempts) which appears on the '99 release ""Lost and Found, You've Got to Earn It"" would fit here nicely. Or Dennis' ""What Become Of the Brokenhearted"". But what is here is great and representative of what made/makes Paul, Eddie, David and Dennis great vocalists and not just great Temptations group members. Great songs ""Soul Mate"", ""Johnnie Mae"", ""Statute of a Fool"", ""Don't Look Any Further"", ""Can I"" ""Once You Had A Heart"" the list goes on and on. A 3rd CD could have been added easily for me. I guess like James Brown, ""I'm a Greedy Man""."
3,"I'm sure it lasts forever, and it's light... But...","This battery is still really light, just as the thinner 750mAh version is, and it does really last forever. But it is VERY thick. I mean really thick, it will not fit in your desktop charger (if you have once), and it will not easily fit in your pocket. It also doesn't fit well on the belt clip either because the battery pushes the phone out away from you. It is light, extremely light for a battery with this much power, but I have had batteries that were smaller than this with the same ammount of power, albeit, they weighed more, but that is still preferable for me. It does do what it says it does. It lasts forever, and it's really light, but if thickness matters to you be warry."
2,Not much improvement over standard battery,"Using the standard Nokia battery, I could go for about 5 days,given the amount of time the phone is on, and the amount I talk. Withthis battery, I can go 6 (occasionally 7) days.Is a 20%improvement really that important to you? Is it worth [it]? (I gotthis battery on special... from amazon, and I still feel that I got abad deal).Don't believe anyone who says you can go 25 days onstandby, it's just not going to happen."
4,Try it you will LOVE it,This dispenser works great with the Note-a-Bags that fit in it. They will keep you from being ridiculed for not having something to clean up after your pet.
2,For beginners only,"This book contains some cute models for beginners. It contains no challenges for intermediate or advanced folders. To be fair, I don't think they are aiming at that audience though!Most of the more advanced looking models, such as the flamingo, contain cutting, so they are not actually difficult at all (and grate against my idea of no cutting in origami)."
1,Very Bad!,"I must agree with the readers who said this book reeked. I was always a little on the edge about how perfect the Wakefield family is, but this was like they were trying to make up for all that happiness by killing Jessica's boyfiend and then there was twins' double...or triple? It was amazingly bad."
3,HELLO!,"THIS BOOK WAS OK BUT IT WAS ALSO DEPRESSING.SAM IS GONE FOREVER JESSICA BETRAYED LIZ BUT LIZ ALSO BETRAYED JESSICA. THIS SEEMS JUST A LITTLE TO MUSHY.UH. WELL IF YOU WANT TO READ IT GO AHEAD BUT CLEAR YOU MIND BEFORE DOING IT,BECAUSE WHEN YOUR DONE WITH THIS BOOK THERE WON'T BE ROOM FOR ANYTHING ELSE!"
5,Good Workout,"This is one of the best workout videos I've seen. I like how you can customize the workout and it indicates how long your customized workout will be based on your selections. The exercises themselves are tough without being impossible and Bob's instructions are good and he doesn't waiver off topic by going into those ridiculous commentaries some video instructors are known to do. I also like the fact that he has ""real"" people behind him doing the exercises and you actually see them working, sweating, shaking, modifying just like you would at home. I definitely recommend this video."
4,The Biggest Loser: Yoga Workout,"I really liked that I could choose which workout. Of course, I am still doing the warm up, 20 minute and cool down but once I get more ""balanced"" I plan to advance further. The key for me was weight loss. You will sweat a bit with this one but then you will look forward to the cool down. I am on the heavier side so those of you looking for a starter exercise. This is it. The only downside is I need the trainer to call me and remind me to pop it in the DVD and get moving. It does not take away the laziness of not wanting to exercise. You've got to have the discipline for that!"
3,Good for sculpting and flexibility,"Bob annoys me a little bit. Works a lot on toning and sculpting--high energy, not a relaxing yoga session."
1,Thankfully I took out of library,I took took out from library...I am intermediate level and found the pace to be too slow and too much talk. This is really for beginners even if you skip to weeks 4 in instruction. I have been doing yoga for 5 years and do power yoga.
3,an aging robicheaux,"I really miss the Dave Robicheaux of 10 years ago. Now that the character must be at least 65 years old I find myself picturing an elderly man as our hero, (like Burke himself) and not the razor-edged hard boiled cajun of yesteryear. (think Baldwin in the film version of Heaven's prisoners). Robicheaux's relationships and altercations seem to have softened with his advancing age. I truly wish Mr. Burke would consider writing a flashback novel- either on Robicheaux's Vietnam experiences, or maybe from his first marriage back in his Big Easy days.But for now, although the writing is still beautiful- Dave is aging into a character not nearly as captivating as the young, electric Robicheaux."
5,A Great Writer,"This is not my usual type of book, but after listening to several audio books of Mr. Burke's, I have come to love his use of language, his evocation of characters and places and his excellent plotting and pacing.He is one of the best there is."
4,Great Storytelling,"This is one of the better Dave Robicheaux novels. His characters are as compelling as ever and his descriptions of Louisiana almost make you feel as if you have lived there all of your life. This book is equal doses or mystery, procedural drama, and social commentary. The marks against it are for the fact the Bella Lujian seems to be a reqworking of the same old Robicheaux villains and for the over the top connection to Katrina. If Burke needed to make a statement about Katrina he could have done it through a story instead of a sermon."
1,Very Odd,"Burke is one of my favourite living writers. His plots are complex, characters interesting, and settings vivid. But, this book does not compare with any of his others. The plot is rushed and characters are left flat and undeveloped. Poor Molly, Dave's latest wife, is given only peripheral attention and treated with the same brush Burke has painted most of Dave's other partners. The conclusion of the book is almost as convenient as waking up only to discover it was only a dream. It has usually been a treat to go into summer with a Burke book to read, but this was a shocker. Even the editing of this book was horrible. Simple spelling errors creeping into many chapters, plots not fleshed out and characters left on the page without significant purpose.I'm wondering what's going on with Burke and his publisher that this book would be put on the shelves in this state. The publisher should be taking better care of such a significant author."
2,Horrible Ending,"This was my first Burke novel, and probably my last. He did an excellent job in the beginning and mid-section of the book, yet it fell apart at the end. The ending was so muddled and complex that I would have to make a diagram in order to understand it. What a shame as it was fine otherwise."
1,Great Live Album but...,"While this is a fantastic set and amply demonstrates how powerful Genesis was live at this time, it's too bad they didn't see fit to release the rest of the show that was broadcast on the BBC. The full version of Suppers Ready, which was also a part of that broadcasted performance, is I'm sure also fantastic and would have completed this wonderful recording. It also would have been nice to be able to compare that version with the later live one released on the Seconds Out recording. But still, even without Supper, this is one of the all time best progressive rock recordings and my personnal favorite of their early recordings."
4,Leaves you wanting more!!!,"This album is almost everything you can say about it: good hits compilation, not-so-good recording (not BAAAAD, but not comparable to other live recordings either), etc.But the one thing I can tell you about this album is: it leaves you craving for more good, old Genesis music. Only 5 tracks com in it. Sure they are awesome songs, but not enough for the hard core Genesis fan.It gets even more sad if you realize it's the only official (that is, not-bootlegged) live recording the band released with their label during Peter Gabriel's era (later on they'd release a box with four CD's, three of which were recorded live).Still, I give it a four, because it's an essential component of the Genesis collection for any tru Genesis fan."
3,Disappointed,"If ever an album deserved an expanded version, it would be this one. Come on guys please open the old tape vaults!"
4,Excellent piece of live Old School Prog Rock,"I've had this on vinyl, then the first release on CD(in abyssmal AAD), and now have the Japanese mini-LP remaster. This is a splendid introduction to the Peter Gabriel-era Genesis. It's an entirely different beast. Kinda dark, and not at all like the pop music they churned out in the 80s-90s.This 1972 performance was released(at least in the US) out of sequence in order to capitalize on 1973's more successful ""Selling England By the Pound"". This show, taken from a radio broadcast, is amazingly pristine. My only gripe is that on the original program there is a stellar rendition of ""Supper's Ready"". Understandably, this 23-minute piece was way too long to fit on a vinyl LP, but CDs don't have that time constraint. A real shame."
2,"ok, sorta","good looking lightly built server cab.Comes with no documentation of wiring, or bracket and hardware layout. So you are left to guess what the designed intended.Its ok if you don't mind fiddling around."
4,balance board,Works best on hard flooring. Don't see this product being used for a long time and the balls are easy to lose. Other than that the grandchildren had great fun with it.
4,Nice.,Works just fine. Fits like a glove. Has leveling set screws and pin in rear to prevent the blade from kicking it out.
1,Worst ever.,A lot is said about Deitel books (especially Java How To). Do not buy them. Im happy I borrowed it at library.
3,To many details too soon,"Like the title says... this book goes into the details of how to build a GUI way too early I thought. Instead of just focusing on the basics of the programming in JAVA first and later have one or many chapters dedicated to building a GUI, this book throws you in it right away, and I do not think it was a good idea.Coming from C, it was very confusing for me at first.Although the rest isn't badly done."
4,This Is Pretty Good,"I just got this CD today. I have been listening to it all day long! I especially like Jennifer Love Hewitt's ""How Do I Deal."" 98 Degrees' ""The Hardest Thing"" is great, too. It's not the absolute best, but it's worth your money if you like pop and R&B music."
4,highly regarded,"""Mannequin Virtue"" sounds a lot like the Police in parts. Probably faster paced but less reggae influence? High pitched lead vocals, reminds me a lot of Adrian Belew's voice. Altogether pretty darn good. Sorry I can't be more descriptive.""Please Stand By"" is more appealing to me, but I don't remember Simple Experience - will listen again and update"
2,Blown out of proportion,This book is filled with too many code snippets and references to HTML and SGML. I found myself constantly skipping pages in an attempt to get to any valuable information about XML.
4,XML Concepts,"This book is a great place to start if you want to get a rough idea of what XML is. I was expecting more technical details, but it seems that there aren't any (at least for those that know HTML or SGML).This book presents XML along with Cascading Style Sheets & well-written DTD's, as a solution to information sharing among industry partners.I really enjoyed the author's sense of humor and found myself laughing aloud at times after careful study of the book's illustrations. As far as a tech books go, this one's a-ok!"
5,A fantastic book; great writing and pictures ....,"A must-buy for any basketball player. Hoops Nation does a great job of bringing out the local color of each court. Ballard brilliantly moves from stories about the players to comments on playgrounds, all the while expressing a true love for the game. The best part about this book is that the author doesnt romanticize his travels. He's just a guy who is looking for a good game, and his detachment succeeds in bringing out the unique flavor of each court he visits. BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
5,Telling the truth about all those liars,"Excellent, I love this book and the information in it is to be used in every classroom. Teachers, take a look at it and bring it to the students.I loved to learn about the tricks that corporations have used to make profits while disregarding the damage they have done to the environment and lied to use about it.This book illustrates how much of what we think of as independent, unbiased news and information has its origins in the boardrooms of the public relations companies.What your student will say after reading this books is something in the lines of:""Where have I been all this life?"".A must read."
5,The Ultimate Red Dirt CD,"The best way to understand ""Red Dirt"" music is to experience it live. There's no way to describe the energy that comes off a stage when the band's cookin'! And you better believe that Jason Boland and the Stragglers are flat burning it down at Billy Bob's! ""Proud Souls"" has got to be one of the best songs ever written and JB & the boys have hit the definitive version here. Get this CD...throw it on the stereo...break out a cold one and your cowboy hat...and prepare to hear the show of your life !"
5,Good protocols!,I'm using this book in my class of genetic engineering and biotechnology and replicate some of the protocols of this book in the lab. With the knowledge could be easy... Good Book.
3,Missing information,"This is a good product; however, with no instructions included as to how to customize it to fit the range of drawers it can fit, it was of no use to me."
1,Not the original productions of Neil's hits that I wanted,"I bought this CD thinking that I was getting the songs I used to have on vinyl (plus a few more).There is nothing here that I liked. Further the other ""greatest hits"" CDs available don't seem to have what I want either. Maybe some day the powers that be will release the 1967 Just for You album on CD? In my opinion Neil has never been better. If you think you are getting the original studio issues on this collection, you are not."
4,Kitchy Fun,"I like to re-discover music from my childhood. Neil Diamond's reputation got a bit battered after the seventies and he became an ""easy-listening"" favorite. Listening to these tunes now, they do seem a bit kitchy. A lot of Diamond's lyrics provide unintentional laughter - examples: ""I am I said, to no one there. And no one heard at all, not even the chair..."" and ""the love she sang to me, the love she brang to me..."" That having been said, one can't help but sing along with most of these songs which have seeped into our collective subconscious. At the end of the day, Diamond is a really good songwriter. This is a great collection of his best songs from the seventies. It leaves off early hits like ""I'm a Believer"" and ""Girl, You'll be a Woman Soon"" and all his eighties stuff like ""Forever in Bluejeans"" - for those, you have to buy two other Greatest Hits compilations."
5,A wonderful book for anyone who has ever memorized PI,"It's really a shame this book is out of print. Although the topic is ""A history of PI"", it is actually a history of the development of mathematics throughout the ages, using thiswonderful number as a connecting theme. Now that I know it's out of print, I'm going to be much more careful about who I loan it to."
1,A poorly baked pi,"There is little to recommend about this title. The author seems to wander into different tangents while getting off of the subject at hand, namely pi. There is little chronological order as shown in many excerpts where he covers a span of 600 years in as little as one page. I find my self constantly referring to the generously given dates strewn about, trying to determine the order of discovery or the century in which he has just jumped to."
3,A History of Pi,"A good read. Accessible by the non-mathematician and provides a good cursory look at the history of mathematics. I appreciated the author's attempt to discuss other culture's contributions to mathematics as well. One criticism is the historical perspective the author takes regarding the ancient Greeks. Other books I have read praised the ancient Greeks for their contribution to abstract thinking, especially in mathematics and structure, but this is not brought out here. Overall if you want a good review of the history of mathematics with concentration on Pi, then I recommend this book."
5,TOUGH!,I've been working out for a long time so I was afraid it would be too easy for me. Boy was I wrong. Excellent workout!
2,video,Not what I expected. I workout on a semi-regular basis but this workout was too much for me. It made me stop using it quickly.
4,Great DVD...makes me sweat,I like this DVD for many reasons. The people in it are real and it makes me sweat. The exercises are great and when I am consistent with it I can see and feel a difference. Bob Harper is great as an instructor.
5,Biggest Loser - Boot Camp,"I am in my late 20's, work out regularly (lift/cardio) and I consider myself to be in good shape. Nevertheless, Bob's 20 minute boot camp gets me burning! Ultimately, it's up the participant to use a challenging amount of weight(s) and really emphasize and exaggerate every move he has you do, but if you do so, you will not be disappointed in the workout that it provides. Everybody has his/her weakest spots but for me, there is no more challenging exercise in the 20 minutes than the walking pushups and pushup plank position. Your shoulders will be trembling by the time you stand up. Bob is a great instructor. Best of all, it's 20 minutes in your living room and you're good to go."
1,Terrible dvd,"I don't watch any of the Biggest Loser shows because honestly, I hate reality tv. BUT, I gave this a shot because it said ""Boot Camp"" and I know people have results from the Biggest Loser so I thought, what the heck.The trainer is ANNOYING!!!!! Wow, I couldn't get past that enough to even concentrate. This guy is leading a boot camp dvd? What a joke! Also, it's NOT boot camp at all. It's pretty basic moves that most people already know. Really dissapointing item. I used it one time and got rid of it. I gave it to a coworker for free because I would have thrown it away otherwise."
3,How Depressing!,"This workout is quite a let down. It's super difficult on my bad knees and the dark empty weigh in room makes a depressing scene to look at. The music is disappointing and does not make anyone want to get up and move. It's nice to see familiar faces from season six, but they barely say anything, I would like more interaction. Heba looks miserable to be there and Allie is like Bob's class pet. I much prefer Jillian's 30 Day Shred. It's a much more professional quality."
5,Wonderful product.,"My sister owned this dvd and she lost it, so I bought it for me. Love this dvd, if you are committed you will definitely gain strength and feel better about yourself. I love it. Just 4-5 days a week does the trick. It gives you options to customize how much you want to do. If you just start at 20 minutes each day, you will feel the results."
4,Bob works ya!,Great DVD for complimenting the other Biggest Loser workout DVD's. Easy to follow and definitely gives a great workout! A good compliment to this is the Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga.
3,good for beginners,I am more of an intermediate to advanced sports person. II prefer Bob's more advanced DVDs like body rev cardio but for you Beginners this is perfect!
5,he is kicking my butt,"I love this DVD for the following reasons, note I am still on level one at the time of this review. (1) You do not have get on the ground to work on abs. (2) I am sweating and feeling it starting as early as the warm up and (3) it is only 25 minutes long"
2,"Good phone, lousy pda functions","I have had this phone for about 4 months. The size is very good and it feels good in the hand. The phone and PTT functions work very well. The e-mail works as advertised. The browser also works well. I had hoped to use this in place of my PDA but found out it won't serve my needs. You can't really store word or excel documents on it. The sure type has never learned to make ""OK"" when I type those keys and correct it. I find I text less because it is too slow. You can't save often used text messages. When this dies I'll look into something else. In the past couple of weeks the phone has locked up 3 times. The battery must be removed to reset the phone."
4,Converted non-BlackBerry believer,"I was the one to make fun of people addicted to their BlackBerrys, now I am one of them. The Pearl is the perfect size for all that it holds, it has great features and an awesome speaker phone."
5,Great package!,"I found this to be a well written and insightful book. The text is supported by an abundance of figures and graphics and, more importantly, by the companion software on CD ROM, which is also available online (at no charge!). I would strongly recommend this book to any student/teacher of computer vision and/or image processing."
3,But does it hold together?,"My younger brother (a Lego freak) got this for his birthday the other day, but decided he didn't like it because it's not Lego. Since I used to be a GI Joe fan in years past, I thought I'd give a shot at building it. At first, it was okay... until I tried to put the figure into it. Then the whole thing fell apart. I had to modify ""mode 1"" for the figure to fit properly, and completely gave up on ""mode 2."" Good luck to anyone else who tries building this."
1,Doesn't deserve a single star,"Even though we live in an era obsessed with youth, there are some people who go to extremes that are just pathetic. For example, the authors of this book.There is nothing pretty, or swell, in seeing two middle-aged women write and act like they are twelve. On the contrary: it makes a grown-up cringe.Ilene and Cynthia (who in this book refer to their husbands as their ""big daddies"") write supposedly cutesy and really moronic advice for becoming a ""perfect hostess.""This book might come in handy - if you are serving tea for your Barbies in the dollhouse. Then again, even a child probably has fresher, more creative ideas than these two."
4,Great Blues Extravaganza,"Although I never heard of Blues Company, they are certainly Keepin' The Blues Alive. There is no false advertising in the title. They play and scowl blues in genuine fashion. Pleasantly surprised and very impressed by this top act."
4,APC is a trusted brand,I have had this for over 4 years now and have been very happy with it. There is a helpful windows program to shut down your PC in the case of a long term power loss. There is no Linux support (running Ubuntu 8.04). This is not very powerful so could only support a smaller desktop or laptop. I have been using it on my laptop.
1,Mambo,"Although the movie, ""Mambo"" was s good movie in its day, the reproduction to DVD is of very poor quality for the price I had to pay for it. I've always purchased my movies from Amazon because they seemed to have better picture-quality, but here lately, I've received some bummers. One was a Terry Moore/Debra Paget movie - ""Why Must I die,""; another was ""Queen of the Nile"";then ""San Francisco Story""; and ""Cleopatra's Daughter."" The picture-quality on all thse movies is horrible.On another note, ""And God Created Woman,"" the picture is fantastic but you can't enjoy it because it is not in English and you have to constantly read in order to understand what they are saying. The film was way too expensive. Years ago I purchased a VHS tape of it in a bargain bin at a Video store for $1.00 and it was in English, but the picture was horrible."
2,no texts,"Unforgivable the fact that there are no librettos excerpts for the pieces compiled here. The other editions of opera rara include texts and notes. Here you have abundant notes to the point of boring but no text. I tried to download texts here and there but no luck. These are virtually unknown works so the presence of a libretto excerpt is essential. Personally I can't even concentrate to listen to an aria if I don't know what they are talking about, no matter what the notes say. Incidentally vocal executions seem fine with good singers, but...."
2,Size-wise.,"Too small, but acceptable. I thought book was much larger and cleaner. Looks can be deceiving. Thanks you very much"
5,not left my disc player!!!!,"This has not left my disc player, so I can only review the first disc:AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I heard these guys a few years ago, and managed to 'acquire' some MP3s. This disc has several tracks I heard a few times before, and some new ones. At times the songs are a bit slow and ballard like, and other times it is hard and crunchy. The lyrics are fun to sing along to, and fairly easy for anyone with a year or two worth of high school German. In fact, I wish I had this when I was in school, so my German would have sounded better (and so I could amaze and amuse my teachers).if you are thinking about buying this, you will not regret it (unless you dont have a taste in music)"
5,lawnmower bag,nice to have a new bag...hope I can put on the new one without too much difficulty. the old one was too brittle and was breaking away
2,Long over the hill...,"Michael Crawford is known for ""Phantom"" and little else, except maybe the 1969 movie version of ""Hello Dolly"". If you want to hear him at his falsetto worst, check out that movie. Even if he is best known as the Phantom, he is by far and away NOT the best Phantom. Crawford has always brought falsetto to a new ""high"" (pardon the pun). You want to see the best Phantom, check out Craig Schulman, best known for almost 2000 performances as Valjean in ""Les Miserables""... or Cris Groenendaal... or the current Phantom, Howard McGillin. All so much better than Crawford.To hear Crawford sing ""Bring Him Home"" from ""Les Mis"".... well, that is simply a travesty. Get your hands on the CD ""Craig Schulman on Broadway"" and hear how it SHOULD sound, not to mention a rendition of ""Music of the Night"" which will bring tears to your eyes."
5,An excellent guide book for all cross stitchers.,An excellent guide book for all cross stichers needing monograms or calligraphy in samplers etc. Well written with extensive diagrams and helpful information. A good book to keep on your shelf for reference
3,Cracked Balls,"They were great while they lasted, but as another customer mentioned, the balls crack so easily. I would try to stick with all-metal barbells as well."
1,Absolute junk!,"I bought these for a wedding and had to buy new ones at the last minute. First of all, they were too short for my legs. And why is that? Not only were they too short, these things have absolutely no stretch and get runs VERY easily. I am NOT ordering nylons online anymore. I would prefer to see what kind of material they are actually made of before I buy! I got better nylons for half the price at another store!"
1,Really wasnt what I expected. Im disappointed,I ordered foglights for my 2000 pontiac grand prix and they wasnt what i expected. I thought they came in a set so that one foglight really does me no good.
5,My new favorite author,Fabulous writing as always. I didn't so much care for the ending. I guess I am just a hopeless pessimest?
2,"Too much in some areas, too little in others","There is little formally wrong with Chabon's Wonder Boys. The laughs are there, and the narrator is amusing and can turn a phrase well. Unfortunately, the novel is uneven in this regard. Very brilliant sections and followed by dull ones, where the effort falls flat. The large middle section of the book involving the quirky Passover seder reads like a set piece of other seders gone terribly wrong.In the end, this so-called dark musing on contemporary writing and the life it generates is curiously detached, emotionally uninvolved, and even trite. Is this the work of the ""great"" Michael Chabon?"
4,Contemporary and entertaining,Good characterization and an amusing if not slightly over the top story about a college professor and the aspiring students searching for their own voice on the page as well as in life
3,yes it is well written but I didn't like it anyway,"I get tired of immature, self-indulgent stories. Yes, Chabron writes well, but the character is too immature and the plot around him and others is predictable. Try reading All Quiet On The Western Front at the same time and you will know what it is I get tired of: the immature boys that we live with and the immature boys we are raising."
5,Great book!,"Best book I have read in quite a while. Michael Chabonis definitely one of the future great writers. Chabon's bookis a much needed satirical look at many of the things we take to seriously. His characters, including some who are gay, mesh well. Chabon did an outstanding job of making the reader see things a little differently, and that was refreshing"
2,Try Lucky Jim,"A lot like Kingsley Amis' Lucky Jim, but not as subtle or imaginative in the writing. Both novels are based on stories of failed, very selfish academics. The surprise in Lucky Jim is that the failed academic is fired (or at least fails to leap over the probation bar). If you want to read a novel of this kind, Lucky Jim is more appealing (in the writing more than in the character). Forced humour in both, I thought."
3,Too long.,"Yes, Wonder Boys is a more mature work than Mysteries of Pittsburgh, but not nearly as good. It is the story of a college professor/author, Grady Tripp, with great talent who has been struggling for years with an ultimately unsuccessful novel (as did Chabon himself), and an unsuccessful marriage. Tripp's relationships with the women in his life are moving and funny and sad and outrageous, but unfortunately they comprise only part of the this too long novel. Whereas in Mysteries of Pittsburgh the drugs and alcohol were in the background, the reader of Wonder Boys is dragged through pages that could be of interest only to someone a little drunk himself. Whereas Mysteries of Pittsburgh was written with a light touch, Wonder Boys often seems to be trying too hard: a case in point is the transvestite character who appears in the beginning of the book and disappears, with no apparent purpose as far as I could see."
3,A really enjoyable romp,"This is my second Chabon novel (after The Mysteries of Pittsburgh all the way back when that novel first came out), and I was completely caught up in it until a somewhat slow family-gathering section in the middle. I loved the book whenever it was focused on James...found Grady a little tedious for the length of the story. I wasn't as enraptured of the story as some others here, but I still respected how beautifully written it was. I was struck by how Chabon develops some extremely fascinating characters and then moves them offstage or drops them almost entirely. But I'm recommending the book, nevertheless, because of how entertaining most of the story is...and how well written."
3,Patchy,"I'm a big Rabih Abou-Khalil fan and I'm always impressed with the musos he gets into the studio, and the amazing interaction that occurs. Pity I'm not a Joachim Kuhn fan, and I can't say this is one of Rabih's best. There are some good moments, like ""Die Brucke"" which chugs along nicely, but otherwise it sounds like two musicians having a jam one afternoon to pass the time, without getting especially inspired. Meandering and rather meaningless, which in my opinion could be Kuhn's fault. ""Blue Camel"", just to mention one better album that quickly springs to mind, walks all over this."
5,LifeTIME Guarranty,"Not only the rolling case is great both in storage and functionality, but also TARGUS is a great company, I've owned an Easy roller for 3 years now and it withstand all the use and abuse that a frequent traveller can inflict to a Computer case, until finally the extensible handle broke (just the plastic grip) i've contacted targus in france took the case to their office, and in less than two weeks, no questions, no charges i've received at home a brand new one from the manufacturer.SO THANKS TARGUS"
5,Still Smokin,This was a Christmas gift for a family member who just received a new smoker for Christmas. Lots of good receipes.
5,The doctor learns about Pippenella .,"Doctor Dolittle wants to do a biography on Pippinella, the green canary. She tells him (in a lot more detail than I am saying) about how she was born in an aviary, bought by an inn owner, then a castle owner, then Aunt Rosie, and finally by a window cleaner. The cleaner had dissapeared one day. What happened? Read and find out."
5,We Are What We Think,"""As a man thinketh in his heart so is he."" (Proverbs 23:7). Prosperity, health, and happiness are a product of our thoughts. This book explains how your thinking has got you where are today and that in order to change your conditions you must change your thinking. Easier said than done. This book is a blueprint on how to change your thinking to become more prosperous, healthy and happy. It expounds upon biblical truths and while it is a very spiritual book, it is not religious. Anyone, from any religion, even an agnostic can use the truths in this book to change their life. I refer to this book daily and have found it to be a catalyst to my own fulfillment and happiness."
1,Is there any respect to the reader?,"When I was reading the book, I thought the stories were interesting. Halfway through the book, I decided to get more information about the author. When I realized that he was dead in 1981, I was shocked! In many of the stories in the book, he mentions the Internet! I know this copy has been revised, but there was no introduction from the Ian McMahan who did the revision. There should be at least a paragraph saying that the stories have been altered to make them more appealing the new generation. But now honestly I have a hard time believing the stories that are on the book. How can I know that they were real and not imagined!The reader deserves a little respect!"
