2,"A disappointment, nothing really new here","I bought this thinking I might find some information that would be new and useful to me. Unfortunately I found neither. To begin with the book is not very well organised into chapters so you can look for a specific topic. Much of her ""advice"" is actually from other people, well at least she gives them the credit, and the tips and hints are often incredibly obvious or just plain old news. Sorry, I breezed through it one night and there was little that made the purchase worthwhile."
4,definetely not rancid,"i thought this might sound a bit like rancid seeing as how tim armstrong is playing guitar and singing. It is NOTHING like rancid, and that would usually be a bad thing, but in this case it isn't. Tim's guitar is pretty similar to Rancid, but when he sings, it's totally different. I really like diamonds and guns. When I first heard it, I loved it, and I still do. Everyone who's anyone knows it now too, which is good because I don't meet blank looks when I mention it. There are only 2 problems - 1) the rap. I don't like rap. That's all. 2) Diamonds and guns is suddenly the theme tune for some shampoo or something as I noticed when the adverts were on on p-rock (a music channel by the way - they probably don't have it in America). This is a bad thing as it means that it is possible that all the peoiple who are noboby (pop-tarts) will soon know it and it will be number one, and I will feel so cheated."
4,revi,It seems to be a very good book. I just took a fast look in it. I think it could contain better quality and more pictures.
5,Afro-Kraut Hard,"ok, just because I share the last name is not the reason I like it. TO be honest, the arrangment is sonically tight. vocals that interweave throughout each song is attributed to the artist and his craft. will you like it? try it before the radio discovers him & you will find your own reason to be glad you bought it prior to hearing it on the radio!!!!"
3,Good not great,"I think the book tries to cover to much in to little space. I would have preferred to see three books instead of one...The first one would cover the Warlord period up to the early 1930s...the second would focus on the conflict between Japan and China from the early 30s through WW2...the last would focus on the struggle between the Communists and the Nationalists...clearly there is some overlap here, but that should be easily handled by good authors..."
1,Account Hacked,I did not order this book and have since felt compelled to close my account with Amazon.com. This is unfortunate but necessary.
4,South Africa before the end of apartheid,This novel vividly describes what it was like for people of colour in apartheid South Africa and specifically the people in District 6 Cape Town who were forcibly moved from their homes. The family comes to life under the author's pen and one loves them all by the end of the book. Tender and funny this is a bitter sweet story told in the words of a young girl born in a difficult time. Despite the faults in some of her family members and the hardships they face the family remains extremely close - especially the females. I loved the book - it reflects an era of tension showing one family's struggle to survive and it's written with humour and great sensitivity.
3,A Scary But Interesting Story,This short story was very interesting and had unique ideas. No other book had any of the same ideas. It was like no other book I have ever read.
3,Much smaller than you would think,These run VERY small in comparison with other belly bands. If you choose this particular product I strongly suggest buying a larger size than you initially think.
5,Brilliant legal insights!,"Weinstein's exploration of the attack on Free Speech is a brilliant examination of one of our fundamental constitutional rights. Filled with insightful observations, Weinstein legal experience as a professor of law at ASU and his early clerkship with Justice Browning show through his elegant prose."
4,Another Masterpiece from the Troma Team,"As far as comedy/horror flicks go, Redneck Zombies is excellent. So poorly made and acted makes for an outstandingB-film cult classic. When an army jeep drops a barrel of toxic waste on the side of a dirt road in hick-ville USA. A local redneck family finds this barrel and uses it to brew moonshine. After this ""Toxic moonshine"" is distributed through out the town a gang of Redneck Zombies go hunting for BRAINS! From Radioactive moonshine to a ... Homo sexual Redneck, this film makes for a fun filled evening of laughs and screams. A great cult classic."
1,This movies reeks of putrefaction.,"I love ridiculously gore-filled movies e.g. Toxic Avenger, Evil Dead 2 and the unholy grail of gore movies Dead Alive. But Redneck Zombies totally sucks. It is not funny in the least and the acting is so painfully bad, you will want to crush your DVD player with a hammer. It's not even worth getting to see how bad it is... it is that bad."
1,NO NO NO!!!!!,"This movie is the pinnacle of trash. I have seen quite a few movies and this is the absolute worst. Now I do admit I like cheesy movies to get a laugh from but this is no cheese, this is straight up junk. I'm surprised anyone would want to associate themselves with this movie. Actually this is so bad it qualifies as a bookend or a coaster NOT a movie. Hmm if I had the choice I would give it negative 1000 stars."
1,This product does not work,"The seller did a good job getting my order to me quickly. The product, however, does not work. I have administered 2 doses to my dog, but I am still noticing worms."
5,my experience,"my lecturer so in love with this book. she teaches word for word from the book, but most of all. nothing cannot beat the price"
1,Un organized and Untrue,"I tried to read this book becasue of a paper I was writing on JBR but I could barely get through it. This book was first really un organized, second completely inaccurate, and thirdly this book didn't pick any side at all. In the end, Eleanor Von Duyke blames the death of JonBenet Ramsey on her brother. It was a waste of time, unless you feel that Burke killed her too."
4,BOOK HARD TO FIND! EXCELLENT PAGEANT REVIEW!,Looked for this book in stores.. couldn't find...finally ordered it through Amazon.com...Great read on the beauty pageant industry...and child abuse. Not sure about the theories though...But I definitely think the Ramsey's are hiding something...
4,A READER FROM TEXAS,GOOD BOOK READ ON THE BEAUTY PAGEANT INDUSTRY. THE ELEANOR STORY WAS SO TOUCHING. BRAVO TOHER FOR COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET.SHE MUST BE SOME TOUGH COOKIE TOENDURE ALL SHE'S ENDURED. THE JONBENET STORY COULD HAVE BEEN STRONGER. IT SHOULD HAVE CONTAINED MORE ON THE PAGEANT SCENE. THELADYIN THE BOOK NEEDS TO WRITE HER OWNSTORY LINES. I'M SURE WITH THE LENGTH OF TIME SHE HAS SOME GOOD READING. I DEFINITELY WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO OTHERS BECAUSE OF THE INSIDE PAGEANT STORY AND THE TOUCHING STORY ON THE DIRECTOR. I CRIED ALOT FOR HER. I CAN SEE HOW THIS WAS TIED INTO JONBENETS LIFE.
2,not that helpful,"Because of the color ORANGE any light feels like your eyes are being cooked. The goggles light up and it's like a orange flash light is being held against your eye, If these were black they would work great."
1,No Conforme,"Recibi la Caja esta semana en Venezuela y no estoy conforme con el producto, ya que me llego con varios lados rotos y la llave no funciona. He comprado varias cosas por amazon y por primera vez me llegan los productos en mal estado.Telefno Contacto. 00507-6090.1043"
2,Bad Shipping,"The products would have been good, but whatever company packaged them did a TERRIBLE job doing so. I ordered two boxes of these dishes and one box was completely shattered and the other box had some very noticeable scratches on 2 of the 4 glasses. If it wasn't for shipping, these would have been just what I ordered. I returned both boxes and bought locally, where no shipping was needed."
4,Great learning skates,"These skates are great for children just learning to skate. It is easiest for kids to learn on ""walking skates"" rather than the lace up ones. My daughter loves these! The second time we took her skating and she was doing it all by herself out in the middle of the floor - no help needed. The only bad thing about these skates is the package says size 6-12, but in all reality it only fits up to a size 10 shoe. At least that is the way it is with my daughter, who now wears a size 10. We bearly get her tennis shoe in these skates - no room to grow."
4,I bought it on sale,"It was a pretty good price although it arrived with one of the big plates broken. There's not much you can do in that case, it's not worth paying to ship it back. Fortunately there's a place I could get an extra plate for $3. Although I saw I could have picked this up there for about the same price anyway. My recommendation is buy from a local dealer."
1,who put this together?,"this is by far the most pitiful exemple of what goth is (goth by the way is an attitude, not a dress code kids...) whining no tallent bands that are videotaped live by what looks like a cellphone, and even if they were in a studio, the majority would still suck. the only group that was decent was Switchblabe Symphony but i alreghty have it.... the rest well, dissapointed isn't a strong enough word, but i'll use it to make my description easy to swallow."
5,Excellent- loved it,"This is my new favorite book. It's the story of 15-year-old Billy who's someday going to be a world famous doctor and 17-year-old menthol-smoking Girl, living abandoned and alone in England. The story is told partly from Billy's point of view, partly from Girl's and partly from a third person narrative. It's a quirky and interesting story- very original. It will definitely leave a lasting impression in the minds of its readers."
4,very good novel from Levy.,"Deborah Levy's ""Billy and Girl"" is an excellent read for anyone who enjoys books that push form and are willing to experience a narrative that is often quite confusing and spontaneous. Just remember- actions and events don't always make sense in this novel, although they all come together in the end. The book concers two orphans and their misadventures in London at the end of the 20th century. Often dark and extremely funny, the narrative switches between 3rd person omnicient, and the thoughts of Billy (a 15 year old who wants to be a pain specialist and make pizzas) and his sister, Girl (a 17 year old searching for the perfect cocktail) together they create chaos out of all of those who encounter them while searching for their mother.Really great, and worth the effort."
2,"Too simplistic: 2 stars for EEs, 4-5 stars for embedded newbies","Ever used an A-to-D? Ever programmed in assembly language? Yeah? BING! You're well past the audience this book is written for.The format is OK, the material is clear, but I thought I was a-gonna get a book with design tricks and software that I could USE. There really isn't much of value here for the experienced designer/programmer. Oh well - I'll have to keep hunting.If you've never built any hardware, then maybe this really IS the book for you! Well, you best read the basic electronics stuff pretty carefully. Also, I'd go get a Texas Instruments eZ430-F2013 Development Tool for 20 bucks and save the kludge-together part of the exercise: you can get up and running faster with something that actually works right outa da box, plus it comes with basic software tools."
5,Wise and gentle book,"This book was well written, and full of kindness and wisdom. Its message was comforting. It brought peace."
5,"Natural, Moisturizing","This is a great facial cleanser, if you don't have oily skin. I think if you have oily skin, it might leave your face feeling a little greasy, since it has lanolin in it. The ingredients are very natural, and the scent is very nice (definitely an orange peel smell, but no overpowering). It leaves my skin feeling really smooth."
4,36 minutes of excellent Rai music,"Buyers need to be warned that there is only 36 minutes of music on this cd. While the music itself is excellent, in my opinion this amounts to only half a cd. I recommend instead the specially priced 4CD anthology ""Maxi Rai"" on Beur FM / Declic Communications / Blue Silver records. It includes tracks by the Chebs Mimoun, Mami, Khaled, Hasni, Tati, among others, with each of the four discs containing over an hour's worth of fabulous music. Buy it first."
3,"Great first song, rest not as spectacular","I bought it used and cheap, so I have nothing to complain about really. The Jaguar song is awesome. The rest is less great - my least favorite Fred Small CD. Lots of the songs sound a bit poppish, which isn't what I was looking for. But it is still better than 99 percent of the music in the world, so put me down as really picky. I love Fred Small in general."
3,Something Happened with 5 pages left!,"This book was one of the most difficult I've read in recent memory. It can truly be considered literature rather than pop fiction. It is the stream-of-consciousness of a businessman in the late 60s/early 70s who seems to be going through some hard times. There is very little plot for over 500 pages, yet the author masterfully draws you into the psyche of the narrator. Then BANG something happens right before the end. If you stick with it, you will find that the character's mental health deteriorates painfully until the defining moment of the book. THEN look for your symbolism, etc."
3,Several Great Tracks but Remastered Sound quality is poor!,"The title track and Fantasy are great tracks, but sadly, they have used a noise reduction system that has altered how the music sounds. Only the title track sounds like it should. The rest of the tracks are flat and the sound has been altered due to the noise reduction. Shame that a professional system wasn't used which would never alter the original source sound. My vinyl shouldn't sound sharper than this CD, but it outshines it by a mile!!!!"
3,Eh.,"I bought this book hoping for something new, a fresh perspective on Goddess Spirituality. I guess I got it, though it wasn't anything like what I thought. The author's statements are not shown to be backed up by any research, and her tiresome use of slashes is bugging me. She speaks often of consequence, and doesn't really explain the term as she is using it. She speaks at the reader, not to you, and she sounds like she is writing a documentary on women's lives. She makes very generalized statements that come across as if she is speaking about all women... ""Women do this and that happens"" ""Women think this and feel such"". There are no statements like ""In the covens I have been involved with, this is how we did it..."", there are very few like ""My opinion is.."". Overall, I am just not impressed. Sorry."
5,Unforgettable,I saw this film at the cinema here in Dublin this spring and am eagearly awaiting the DVD release. Bruno Ganz gave an unforgettable performance in the leading role. For any student of WW2 this is a must see production of the dying days of Germany at the end of the war.
5,one of the best war films ever,"Living in the USA, I had heard almost nothing of this film until some internet jokes circulated about. Far too often films will embellish history in order to makes the subject matter more appealing to wider audience. This film is based on the recollections of a woman who was in the bunker with Hitler until the very end, so I was left with the feeling that this film represents a quest for truth. Just how does an intelligent society fall apart and sink so low ? I thought this film addresses that issue and is aptly titled ""Downfall"" in English. It is in German with subtitles, so one must watch carefully."
5,Terrific character development ...,"This really isn't a shoot-em-up, but that's quite alright. Though setting the movie mostly in the bunker would seem restrictive, it is not. When I think back about this video it almost seems more real than a film ... I felt the characters come alive, though we really wouldn't want that. Even just watching Hitler sitting at a table eating was stunning ... sounds absurd, but it came across as if I was sitting there watching him. Well done!"
4,Not enough Bruno Ganz!,"Excellent, riviting, chilling. Ganz is amazing! The movie is depressing as it should be. Great German actors but I wanted more Ganz! He is an amazing actor, never a better portrayl of Hitler in my opinion. Overall one of the best movies about the last days in the Bunker ever!"
2,OH! So CONTROVERSIAL!,"This movie would be a revelation if it had humanized Hitler. But it didn't. Bruno Ganz' performance was uninspired. He's a great actor, but he doesn't do anything that strays far from cliche. A lot of yelling and sweating and twitching. The only thing revelatory about the movie was the character of Goebbels and his wife; or rather, the performances of said characters by their actors. The movie was disappointing and almost pointless because the moviemakers created the movie on the assumption that the making of it would justify its existance. It didn't. There is no idea in this movie. It is just props. Try it again, Germany."
3,Okay Job,"When the movie arrived, the cd was moving around in the package. The plastic center ring holding the cd in place had broken off and the dvd could have gotten messed up. I haven't played it yet, but otherwise things are good."
5,Powerful Stuff,"I never, ever liked watching foreign language films. Until I saw this one. Funnily enough I first came across this movie on YouTube, where people were using a scene from the movie to make parodies of Hitler (Hitler and Ryan air / Hitler can't find Wally etc.) It was then curiosity that made me buy the DVD and boy am I glad I did. This is powerful stuff."
1,These Blades Are Junk!,"I bought this and the companion smaller blade for my 2010 Corolla. I should have just taken my money out of my wallet and thrown it away. These were absolutely worthless. After a few days of use, the wiper wouldn't ""flip over"" to the opposite side when clearing my windshield. Two wipes lead to one smear. As if that wasn't bad enough, not all of the blade's edge made contact with the window. When I cycled through a spray and wipe, there was windshield washer fluid in big unwiped splotch on the window's bottom edge. Save your money, don't buy these wipers!"
2,Bad wiper,After have this wiper for six months it is not performing very well. It chatters and does not clean the window very well in cold weather. I would not recommend this wiper.
5,What a great romance!,"I've loved all of Shelley Bradley's books, but I have to admit, HIS LADY BRIDE, is probably my favorite. As always, Ms. Bradley knows how to draw the reader into her story. I was hooked from the first page. Aric and Gwenyth are a wonderful couple! A must-read for any romance fan."
4,Feed the Animals,"This is a book by H. A. Rey, the author of the Curious George series. It is a fun story for preschoolers about life at the zoo. The rhyming, Lift-the-Flap format makes for extra involvement and entertainment. Children enjoy guessing which animals are behind each flap. The illustrations are very similar to the Curious George books.When my children were very small, sometimes Curious George was too long. This series (there are five books in Mr. Rey's Lift-the-Flap series) is a nice prelude to Curious George."
2,"Good idea, poor book","The start of the book is good, besides it is hardly beliefable that things are still working after 100 years in the hardest conditions. The psychology of the characters is not very deep but the ultimate adventure that awaits for them made me read further after the first 50 pages. However when Ch. Manson appears in the story everything turns to the bad, worse, worst direction. The whole adventure becomes ""forced"" like the author had to make an end to the story (time pressure ?). The storyline becomes idiotic and completely boring. Actually it is a book you only read by ""accident"". I can not imagine that one is actually looking for it (unless she/he is forced to)."
2,Very bad product!,"I bought Nad's natural hair removal gel 6 oz from CVS for $20 and I am very upset. I try to remove hair from face and I do it for many times but still it doesn't work well,specially ticker hair it doesn't remove at all."
2,Doesn't work well on my legs,"I had to go over the same spot several times. Maybe my leg hair is too coarse, but this didn't work for me..."
2,Doesn't take the hair off,"It only really removed about 75% of the leg hair I applied it to and it barely removed 30% of the coarser hair. It used a ton of wax and all of the strips just to do my legs and it didn't get anything off my knees. The only place it really worked well was where there were just a few relatively fine hairs like the thighs. Gave me some nasty looking red bumps for about 2 days, but that wouldn't have been a big deal IF it actually removed all the hair I applied the gel to.The only reason it's 2 stars instead of 1 is that it didn't hurt that much and it was very easy to use."
3,The other ones are better,"We started reading the Cowgirl Kate series with ""Partners"". Then we read ""Rain or Shine"". Each of those is top-notch, and we actually did buy Partners after renting it from the library over and over again. This one is a little too long and not as engaging. Where the others are very readable... easy to get into, do the voices, emote properly... this one seems duller. (Buy the other two -- at $7 it's worth it -- but try to get this one from the library before committing.)"
3,Not sci fi but a good read,This book falls into the category of Mystery more than Sci Fi. It was a good read about how people manipulating each other to get a final prize. It was averagly interesting and will keep you occupied.
1,Very bland and boring,"I rented this mainly because of the good reviews and the strong cast. Unfortunately the cast didn't have much to work with here. The pacing of the film is very slow, you could walk out of the room for 20 minutes and not miss much. I would put it on the same level as a D grade Lifetime Network made for TV job. Sorry."
2,Not specific enough,"Very small section on South Africa. I was just traveling there and was under the impression this book would cover just that country. Instead it covered all of southern africa which I was not interested in. May be good is you are traveling all over but if you are not, don't bother."
1,A literary triumph... I can't wait until the movie comes out,"This might be the best book any elitist, intolerant, bigot has ever written. It has it all. It tells you how to live, what to believe, and even what is wrong and right. It is my hope that this book will be in classrooms everywhere someday. Students should just burn all history and biology books and read this book over and over again until it has completely brainwashed them."
4,Good insight into Pat's world,"Anyone who wants to understand what drives Pat Robertson (and by extension, the Christian right)definitely needs to read this book.Probably assuming that only his sheep will read this book, Robertson freely exposes his feelings on homosexuals, Muslims, and foreigners. He expresses what can only be called paranoia of Freemasons, Illuminati, and world bankers. There is no reserve of disdain for the 96% of people who don't happen to live in the US.Conspiracy theorists will love this book, as will snickering skeptics. I gave it only 4 stars, because the style is somewhat rambling, and the logic is difficult to follow."
3,Similar to John Erickson's book,"Ye, This is well researched and written book. But I think John Erickson's ""Soviet High Command"" is much better than this book. Erickson's book is covered same periode and more interesting. Nevertheless, this is good book and I recommend this."
3,Good start,"Easy to read and lots of illustrations, all in 224 pages.This is a reproduction London edition of 1900.The first Carol Publishing Group Edition was 1991."
3,Not what I expected,"The one-sided reviews found elsewhere are of limited value. The book goes into great detail on subjects covered, which is usually good, but are sometimes overly elaborate with long derivations making for a very thick book. With circuit simulation programs freely available, it is not clear why the complete transfer function formulas for various filter are derived. Transmission line characteristic impedance formulas are handy if you don't have it already. Readers who are interested in Bode plots, time domain analysis, high voltage breakdown, Laplace transforms, Fourier series graphs, and mutual inductance should find it valuable. For the other subjects listed under the contents, I would look elsewhere."
5,Excellent Reference Book,I originally rated this book 1 star but not because of materials. It was for a poor qulality of paper that CRC used to publish this book. I still thinkpaper on this book S...ks but the subjects and depth of material is outstanding.
5,MOVIE,LOVED THE MOVIE AND ALL THE ACTORS IN IT. BEAUTIFULLY DONE. AND I HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS TO ALL MY FRIENDS.
4,Great used value.,"Great used value. I found it for $9.99, not bad for blu-ray. I would recommend it. It's lot's of fun."
5,great product,"Everything as in its original plastic wrap, brand new, as described. The blurays work perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase."
1,for those looking for this box set on Blu-Ray.... STAY AWAY!,"This is, without a doubt, the WORST quality blu-ray movie I have seen!! what were they thinking when they did this transfer? It is hard to see a big difference in this regular DVD and the Blu-ray.The movies are great. the quality is a real let down. This review is based on the HD quality, not the review of the movie, as it should be on the Blue ray box set listing. Don't waste your money until they do a better job with the quality of the conversion"
4,Great collection!,"This is a great collection of the Ocean's movies. Reasonably priced, nice box set. I would recommend this product."
5,Oceans Trilogy,This product was received in perfect condition with a very nice looking outer box. Thanks!
3,Not High Definition,"The movie's are entertaining, but the movie is DVD quality, not HD. Be carefull alot of Blu-rays, say they are HD but they are not."
4,9.99 for 3 great movies,10 bucks for a box set....seriously what is there to complain? Good price but just that i have to wait for more than 3 weeks for it arrive. Apart from that - excellent buy!
4,A huge step up from the DVDs. A great set,"As a huge fan of the Ocean's Trilogy, I would love to see a collector's set sometime in the future. This set, however, is quite alright. Each movie now has its own commentary and there are some fun featurettes thrown in. I recommend this to anyone interested in the trilogy since, at this price, its pointless to buy them individually."
3,The watch didn't work; got a refund,"The book was great, and just what I wanted to help our granddaughter learn to tell time. Unfortunately, the watch didn't work. I was given a refund on it, which I will use to purchase a new child's watch. I am satisfied."
1,broken broken broken,"The smallest jolt from my son, while playing, caused the minute hand to break off. While the book is very concise and easy to follow, the broken watch makes the whole package unusable."
5,LOVE IT!,So much easier than using any thermometer! I use it to keep guard of my 17 month's temp when he's sick. He hates the ear thermometer and I prefer not to use the rectal unless his temp has hit a certain point. LOVE THIS!
5,Excellent Overview,"This book is an excellent general atlas with beautiful maps and helpful descriptions of interesting areas for each country. It is mainly an atlas first and therefore can not go into full descriptions of every area of interest or else it would be much too large and expensive. If you need a more thorough travel guide I would suggest you purchase one for an individual country, which can go into much more detail. For what this is intended for though it its a real treat. Great book."
1,Lasted only 2 months,"I too have a DM890 that I am fed up with! I bought it two months ago and it started leaking large amounts of water all over my clothes. I then discovered that there is a loose connection at the swivel cord that causes the iron to stop heating. Unacceptable for such an expensive iron.I previously had a lower level Rowenta and decided to replace it when that one started leaking water. I thought maybe the ""professional"" would be better.I came online today to research whether to simply replace this with the same model - don't think I will be doing that!"
2,Still problems with the cord,"We bought our DM890 a little over six months ago and thought it was a fine product in terms of effectiveness in ironing. What seemed weird was how the heavy duty cord would become so easily twisted. Last week the twisting became too much for the wiring to bear and the iron shorted out. The cord actually popped (mini explosion if you will) with a slow flame coming out of where the rupture occurred. It was sort of like a burning fuse.Anyway, a check of the warranty shows that it was only good against defects for six months. My wife wanted to try taking it back to Target where we bought it, but I suspect she will have little luck. If the manufacturer is only going to guarantee it for six months, I suspect Target will not be obligated to do anything. For a ""professional"" model and for the higher price we paid, I would have expected much better."
1,Poor craftsmanship on this one!,"I am unhappy with this iron and the customer service at Rowenta. I have only had the DM890 for two years and it now has a leak coming from the base, from the water tank. Even though the warranty has expired, I would have expected Rowenta to fix the problem but there was no offer from them to do this after calling them and explaining the problem. I had a Rowenta before this one which I was very happy with and so bought another one expecting the same quality. I will be looking for another brand. I only gave it one star because I have to enter at least one to submit this review, otherwise I give it a ZERO!"
4,Great album,"Great album with some very likeable tunes. As a bass player I love listening to it, great grooves and playing from a true master. Though, my girlfriend even enjoys the music on this album. If you play bass, get it! If not, get it anyway."
1,Major disappointment,"This CD is a major disappointment. Nothing worth listening that we haven't heard in previous Miller's CDs. Many tracks have the most basic harmonic structure and the arrangements are amateurish and boring, and there is an incredibly corny cover of old Ludwig Van' Moonlight Sonata (talk about bad taste!). The vocal tracks are average R&B tunes sung by less than average vocalists, and the lyrics just suck. This is a travesty of the Marcus Miller we know and admire, an incredible gifted musician and producer who should know better and should respect his fans and admirers."
5,Travis,This is another tight album. You can play it straight from the first track to the last. Every cut is great. Marcus and his band has done it again. Every musician on this album drops the music in the right spot...
2,average,"Marcus Miller is a Great Musician period. but His solo albums are pretty much always the same.Yes He can Groove on the Bass,but you don't get anything more than what you have already heard.hearing a Cat being so Polished can bring Limitation in itself."
5,Fluval Biomax Bio Rings,"Received product in a timely manner, price was fair and I will continue to use this product. New to saltwater tanks but have a few fresh water tanks. This stuff works well. I would reccommend it to anyone."
5,Great Shoe,"Really comfortable and stylish. The sole isn't leather, but it's durable. Good for walking and standing in for a long time."
2,Soles Are Mediocre,"I agree with what many are saying. The uppers are well constructed, and the soles especially in the front where your toes flex, and at the ball of your foot are thin.I have left foot pain with certain shoes and I cannot walk in these. Uncomfortable.Of course they cause no problem for my right foot.I have had this issue with many shoes. And many shoe companies pull this crap where they make a solid upper, and an office to the car sole. NONSENSE!"
3,Well made--so why not make it comfy?,This is a shoe with very good quality and workmanship. If you take a look at all the stitching that goes into making this shoe you can see that these probably take a bit of work to make.My question then is why would any well-known shoe company make a shoe like the Touareg and then not worry about comfort? The soles are thin and flat with little cushion. All you get is a fancy looking (but thin and flat) removable liner inside. There is no arch support and very little between your hard-working feet and the ground.I find it very strange that these are made so well in some ways and so thoughtlessly in others. Close to 2-stars but will give 'em 3 for the workmanship.
4,Buy This with Barrio Fino,"Just back from Puerto Rico, these 2 albums contain the songs that everyone was playing there. Good times!"
4,One of the highlights of my CD collection,"Wonderfull CD. I had to get used to it (for I haven't heared Klezmer before), but after a while my family complained whether my CD-Player can't eject the CD so I can hear something different :-)"
2,I'll Take A Chance...,"Like Lawyer Reader said in an earlier review, these things arrived at room temperature. Shipping essentially doubles the price of these little fish, so you might assume that they get shipped in a reliable and safe way. Not so. It comes in a small box with little insulation and a couple of (melted) ice packs. I'm going to eat them anyway. I'll update this review when (if) I survive, but when one orders high-end food products, one expects first-rate handling of the product by the shipper. I'll be looking somewhere else for my next anchovy fix.Update.....Well, I had four of these little things a couple of hours ago. They are very good, and I'm still alive. I've had better in restaurants, but these are better than any I've bought in a store or ordered online. Still, I won't order them again because of the poor shipping practices."
1,Cat's music ain't worth half a Quarter,50 cent is just operating musically from the EMinem&Dr.Dre Factory of music making as to challenging himself&it shows here. still Mumbling&Stuttering to predictable Music&Dime a Dozen lyrics that he could write while washing the Dishes. He talks alot of smack for a cat who is just putting out tired music.
4,"Enjoyable read, with forgivable factual errors","This is a very good read, and a good look at the mentality towards Budo training in Japan. The book is obviously skewed towards presenting Aikido as a functional martial art, and contains some incorrect information about Gracie Jiu Jitsu, but for the most part it is a worthwhile read, as long as the reader doesn't accept the contents as gospel."
2,"Inexpensive, but not good quality","Probably the least expensive 10-30 zoom binoculars you can find. However, the quality is lacking. The problem with these is they are very hard to focus, and the focus wheel is very sensitive. A little nudge sets them out of focus, and you need to re-focus again. That means that if you adjust the distance between view lenses to set for distance between your eyes, the focus is lost. And focusing them is hard - it has to be just right. A little bitt off, and focus is lost. I do not recommend this pair. I am returning mine, and using a Celestron UpClose zoom binoculars instead. Just a little more expensive, but same zoom numbers and lense sizes. Also, Celestron has a Field of vivew of 4.1 degrees, compared to this item's 3.8 or 3.9. Buy at your own risk."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"Honestly, I was somewhat disappointed with McClelland's Photoshop CS Bible. In the Preface he mentions another version titled ""Photoshop CS Bible, Professional Edition"" which I don't think really exists. If it did maybe I would have been less disappointed. I have been using various versions of Photoshop for over 6 years and have bought many Photoshop how-to books for most of the versions. I hadn't gotten around to getting a book for Photoshop CS until now. What I was looking for was a very detailed book getting into the changes made for version CS and especially getting into the details of the automated and batch functions.Unfortunately this book barely touched on the specific new areas of Photoshop that I wanted to learn about, despite having over 1000 pages! I also noticed that there are only about 16 actual color pages in the whole book. For those just learning how to use Photoshop, this lack of color examples could be a real drawback."
1,"Such a Disappointment, and It was a Gift!","I bought this iron to surprise my friend who always wanted one, but could not afford it. The FIRST one she got leaked from the iron. The SECOND one she got -- after we returned the first one -- has a leak in the tank. I am SO MAD! I did not know about the second one in time to return it because my friend was embarrassed to tell me. I still would not know about it if I had not asked how her iron was working. I HATE wasting my money. Every time I think about it, I want to cry. Do NOT buy this iron! I have one of the more expensive versions of Rowenta Steam Generators, and I have not had issues with it."
3,It does not work as well as expected. not as good as the old one.,"This Iron was a replacement for their older version, that we wore out.This one works OK, but the steam is not as good, and spits too much water."
3,its okay,The first five minutes of ironing the iron spews too much water. This is my second Rowenta and the first one did not do this.
2,Poor quality control,"The reviews sounded great. The product seemed great. The problem is that the quality control is anything but great. Twice, the thermostats were defective, which was perhaps why the iron kept spitting -- at one point ruining my wife's linen jacket with water spots.It's true that the iron delivers copious amounts of steam. Should you happen to get one that holds the temperature and doesn't spit -- and if you like your ironing device BIG -- you may well love it. But for me, it was just not worth the effort."
5,Just What I Wanted,I already knew a lot about this product having been introduced to it by a German friend last year. I was so impressed by her's that I knew if my old iron ever gave way I would look into buying this product. Yes it takes time to heat up but the steam ironing is so great it is worth the wait. I had a small problem with the original iron sent to me and called to talk to the company who sent the iron and got such a great response from them about shipping it back that following their requirements for returns was easy. They were very gracious and dealing with them was a breeze. I just received the new iron and am loving having it back in my home. I would recommend this to my friends and have already to my daughter in law.There is a bit of spitting when the iron first heats up but that goes away in no time. This iron is far superior to any other I have ever owed and I have owned a number of irons through the years. I think this may be the last one I ever have to buy. I love it!
1,Poor quality and leaks hot steam and water,"Shoddy build quality. Boiling hot water and steam leaking from the joints on very first use.See the photo I uploaded. Click ""View and share related images"" underneath product images to see for yourself.Product returned to Amazon for a full refund."
3,Great but,"Great amount of steam; however, takes up to 11 minutes to heat up which means last minute ironing is out and it spits water when you first start ironing. This only happens the first couple of presses on the steam button and is easily solved by discharging it on the board first. Of course this is a bit of a pain. Once it is working, the volume of steam is impressive. The angle of the handle is a little strange. I liked their previous versions better. We used our last model for about seven years."
1,Rowenta Pressure Iron Steamer,Too heavy and bulky and our product did not work properly and had to be returned.
4,Great Iron,"I lost a bet with my wife -- so I now do all of the ironing. No problem. I like this iron A LOT.Two things - the O ring was torn on the tank valve (out of the box)-- the valve you screw into the water tank. It takes a 11 x 2.5 mm O ring.Also, the unit has to completely cool down before adding more water to it.I waited an hour after unplugging it -- when I poured water into the tank I got a nasty surprise. It looked like an erupting geyser.Be careful and enjoy ironing (if that's possible)."
4,Rowenta DG 5030 steam generator iron,"After using a regular Rowenta iron for some time with good results, we decided to upgrade to a Rowenta DG5030 steam generator iron. We made this decision after hearing of the time savings when ironing with a steam generator iron. We read other reviews of less costly steam generators, costing under $100 and their poor performance. This product is slightly more expensive. After a few weeks of using the Rowenta DG5030 steam generator iron it has lived up to our expectations as a quality product. It takes about 5-10 minutes to build up enough steam pressure, and when ready we are able to iron more clothes, more neatly, in less time than our conventional iron. We recommend this product without reservations."
2,"Great iron, but the lack of a water level is its downfall","I like the iron. It does a great job on even the gentlest of fabrics!Though, I do iron in large quantities and the lack of a water level is the product's downfall. I followed the instructions on how to refill the chamber while in use, but it still was dangerous and not worth it. I used up whatever steam was left in the unit, then let it cool and unplugged it too. According to the rather simple directions, this should have sufficed. Though, when slowly unscrewing the cap, a loud shriek came out of the unit and nearly burned me. Now, I've worked with professional models as a tailor over the years, but this was the worst near accident that I've ever had. Granted, this may have been my own fault, but I clearly did what I had to do and again, there was no way to tell how much steam and or water was left.I find myself using this iron for only part of my ironing until deciding to revert back to my old reliable one."
2,OLD FAITHFUL - NOT,"having owned an earlier model of this rowenta and loved it, i didn't bother to do any research. they did a great job with the improved funnel, which lets u c when the water reservoir is filled. however, this iron spits and spews water like old faithful. NOT HAPPY!!!"
2,Leaking tank,"I just returned my third (and last) Rowenta DG5030. My first one lasted for years and I would still be using it if I hadn't dented the cap to the water tank, causing steam to escape through the cap. The second one started leaking from the bottom, so I exchanged it for a replacement. Within 4 months, the new one started leaking heavily, saturating my ironing board. I've returned the iron and purchased another brand for much less money and it's working perfectly. I'm a quilt maker and a good steam iron is a must."
2,"Great for a while, then it died","The good news is that, out of the box, it's a great iron. Unfortunately, it's not built to last. Ours died after a year-and-a-half, which is conveniently beyond the one-year warranty. We took good care of it, but unfortunately we didn't get our money's worth."
2,Great if it works,"There is a leak in the system so the steam is coming out from many capartments of the base unit and not just the plate of the Iron. I am working with Rowenta on getting a replacement. Otherwise, I love the brand!"
5,Rowenta Iron,"I first used the Rowenta when visiting family in Switzerland. It was so marvelous that as soon as we returned to the US, I went on line and ordered it for myself. It makes ironing unbelieveably easy. It's still not fun to iron, but now it's not the chore it was before I used the Rowenta. Everyone should use one."
5,"Hilarious, biting satire of college life","This book is one of the funniest and smartest books I've ever read. This novel, sort of an update on Lolita, centers on a writer / college professor named Swenson who begins to have feelings for one of his female students.Prose really understands how the male mind thinks and makes Swenson intelligent, kind, foolish, and self-destructive all-at-once.One of the true highlights of this novel is Prose's attention to detail--from writing about New York restaurants to college libraries. Prose is at her best when detailing college fiction classes where students' written stories and subsequent commentaries are both funny and painfully true. Highly recommended novel."
3,I enjoyed reading 3/4 of this book,"I enjoyed reading 3/4 of this book; I couldn't put it down. But then I found myself counting the number of pages I had to read to finish it ... only 35 more, only 25 more, 10 more, 9,8 ... ugh.Prose is a wonderful writer and I will look to read more that she has written, especially Reading Like a Writer. However, and yes there is a big however, the ending didn't do the book justice. It just fell flat."
1,"manipulative characters, manipulative author","The book is extremely readable and descriptive, which serves to make this manipulative novel all the more infuriating. It is obvious that Prose has issues towards academia and, more precisely, men in positions of power within. I have never encountered a central character so deliberately and antagonizingly destroyed. The manipulation with which the young girl employs to tear down this professor is topped only by the author herself, in setting up and then pulling the rug from under the reader. Francine Prose IS Angela Argo, an alter-ego to slay her dragon. I regret being taken along as a witness."
3,Not her best,"Francine Prose is a terrific writer. Her earlier works, especially Hunters and Gatherers and Primitive People were among the best books I have ever read. This one disappoints -- the protagonist is a passive blob of jelly who is wheeled from scene to scene and does nothing about anything occurring around him. The ending necessarily falls flat as a result of this. It is also too obviously contrived -- like one of those Shakespearean plays where every character gathers onstage for the last scene and everyhting is tidily wrapped up. Still, the other characters are well-drawn and interesting and the writing, as always in her work, is clear, refreshing and carries you along. If you have read her earlier works, this one is worth reading (though you might wait for the paperback). If you don't yet know Francine Prose, start with one of her earlier books."
3,"Enjoyable, but read ""Straight Man"" by Russo instead!","I enjoyed this book -- the ending was a bit rushed and felt clipped, but I enjoyed it. However, if I were to recommend a book skewering campus life (though not so much PC campus life), I'd have to stick with one of my favorite books of all time -- Straight Man by Richard Russo. Like Wonder Boys, Blue Angel is good, funny, and smart about college life, but it doesn't get me the way Straight Man did."
2,Blue Angel,"I agreed with Lauren C. who also rated this book with 2 stars. In the end, this book leaves you with a dismal feeling about most of the characters and an unexplained, unfinished plot. The subject matter, I must say, is not pleasant but the book could have left the reader more satisfied."
2,THIS GAME WALKS A FINE LINE...,"Between frustrating and boring. It's yet another game out of the mainstream, setting wise; post WWII I think? Um...this low score I gave it might just be more of my preference. I'm more of a traditional WWII+ FPS and this was a bit off that beaten path. I bought it out of desperation, at a cheap price so, no love lost. Just too weird for me I guess...supernatural + military = WeIrD. What can I say? I bought NECROVISION at the same time; both out of desperation for something to do. Into the GOODWILL bin it flies...."
4,The G5 Imac is very nice,I was very lucky getting my G5 Imac so cheap. Having cash in hand is so important. This is so versitle and very fast. The Super drive is dual layerand the display is so clean. Make sure you get the 2 gigs for the memory. This unit needs all it can get.
3,"Good, but...","There are several mistakes in the japanese names of the techniques. In some cases the japanese name of the technique, such as the pictures, are wrong."
4,Beginners book!!,"This book is a very easy read book. It is easy to read and easy to understand! Many martial art books are often written so that ""normal"" people woulden't understand the true meaning. In this book everybody can understand! This book is very direct and full of facts about Aikido.Well it is a beginners book with a lot of useful information. So if you are about to start your Aikido training or has just begun, this book is it!!"
2,Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere: An Illustrated Introduction,"OK, the illustrations LOOK easy and simpel. But i really dislike this book. Techniques have names, these names expand your knowledge of japanese, the language for a part as well as how to understand it. And here we use some numbers ????Uke uses attack #37, tori responds with a number #12... no... that's old school, in times when we didn't know beter..."
3,SHAKEY,Too much room between the the top two panels and it is very unstable and shakey. I would not purchase this product for my home use. I am currently inAfghanistan and this is were this shakey stand will live.
3,cool looking,"I like the design and the fact that I can roll it around easily, However when we put it together the laptop section was tilting down toward the ground to the right so the laptop sat crooked. My husband said that he could fix it and he did. I'm not sure if this is a normal problem.Debra"
5,I'm Satisfied,"Works well. I have no complains. Easy to assemble and simple to use. What else can I ask for? It's not perfect...(to tall to use on my couch, but I can tilt the top to make up for it...and it wobbles if I press down to hard, but why would I want to do that?)"
5,Good,"This is the only espresso bean I've bought, so I can't really compare it to other beans. But I like it. I just make regular coffee with it.Despite the instructions for my French Press to brew for only 4 minutes, I found that I had to brew for longer to bring out the rich sweet chocolatey taste. I let it stew for at least 8 minutes, but 15 minutes tastes good too. Brewing this bean for only 4 minutes results in a relatively diluted, tasteless coffee. I use a ceramic grinder to grind the beans immediately before brewing.It has a thick, mouthy texture. The beans smell strongly of smoky chocolate/truffle, almost cloyingly so. The taste is thick and sweet. I would recommend brewing for longer if possible to try and bring out more flavor.You get a 16 oz. (1 lb.) bag for the price, so it ended up being $20+ after shipping."
2,Accurate and Adequate,"If you want the standard, basic, current and historic information on this exciting vacation destination, then this is the book for you. I learned a great deal of factual information; however, it lacked the detail I was seeking in a travel companion. I only had ten days in paradise so I needed detailed information on sites which were normal tourist stops as well as sites off the beaten path. This book did not provide what I was looking for. The maps provided were lacking, and there were no photos to speak of. If you want a book with the most clear, comprehensive, and concise information and maps, then you want ""Hawaii - The Big island Revealed""."
4,Very very cool,I grew up with this show. So to finally have the whole series made me extremely happy. Cant complain here. No special menus no extra content. Just 3 discs of king arthur and the knights of justice. All the episodes nothing is missing. I would recommend this to anyone. Great show. Waiting hopefully for the bluray version.
2,laughs and giggles,"this cartoon is based on the hero king arthur, but something happens to him and his knights and merlin has to bring others from the future to save him. it is a good concept but the dialogue and some of the action is very cheesy"
1,Magnet not strong enough,"We bought one of these about a year ago at a hospital gift shop for my 4 year old, after he had a medical procedure. We got it home and the magnet was so weak, it couldn't pick up the cars. My husband bought a set of magnetic chip clips at Target and dissected the magnet out of them and replaced it. Ridiculous. I wish the person in China who decided to save 2 cents per unit had been at my house to explain why the toy we bought him after a traumatic doctor's office visit didn't work. After modifying it, my son loved it."
4,Life With Yuichi,"Nice in this harsh movie Yuichi and his friends cause mischief and shoplift, Yuichi gets fascinated with Lily Chou Chou, One of his closesfriends Shusuke has a near death experience and becomes a bully he andthe other friends start to mistreat Yuichi.Yuichi has a decision to makelet Shusuke keep bullying him or do something about it."
3,Great CD But Needs To Be Remastered Better,"Gary Moore ""Wild Frontier"" is a great cd but needs a better job of remastering. The other remastered Gary Moore cds are great and play much louder than this cd. ""Wild Frontier"" cd only plays half as loud as the other remastered cds from Gary Moore. With 24 bit remastering available, there is no excuse for poorly remastered cds. So hopefully ""Wild Frontier"" will get re-released with better and louder remastering just like the other Gary Moore cds."
2,Not as bluesy as others,Not really a blues album. All his others are really blues and I like them much better
5,Wow!,This is one of the best mysteries I have read in a long time. I can not wait to read the rest of the series.
4,Excellent,Good quality. Good clearity. Little to no distortion.Installed in an 86 Chevy K10 Pickup and looks wonderful. Would recommend for early model trucks. Has a retro look.
4,Good.,"It arrived on time and in good condition. Although it can't compare with a real stove, it is a good alternative for those who don't have one."
3,How stupid EMI people are?,If they have 16 years time to redo this live album why the hell they could't have even players names on it??? And where are bonus tracks from? Record company people are too lazy.
3,What could have been,"This is a perfect example of an album that could have been so much moore. There are some great tracks and there are some bad tracks.Murder In The Skies is worth the price of admission alone. Fantastic song (although the guitar solo-intro is kind of out of place for such a dark song)The title track and Devil In Her Heart are very good.Shapes Of Things is good.The rest of the album really falls short with a few stinkers.Gary's voice is also very limited; I think a different singer could have really livened things up. Great guitar work though, love the meaty sound on Murder & Devil.I use to have this on cassette way back and just picked this up...great to hear these tunes again.3 1/2 stars"
4,Arthritis Relief,"I have only been using this product about 3 weeks, but, in that time, I have seen some improvement in my arthritis symptoms. Mind you, I wouldn't call this a miracle, but this product has enabled me to reduce my daily dosage of ibuprofen (from 6 to 8 per day to 2 per day). I have experienced no side effects or problems (stomach upset, etc.) from use of this product."
5,You simply must try this whole-body inflammation fighter!,My wrist-ache went away for good. I also believe this product helps against the inflammation that causes MS and other autoimmune diseases.
1,Too much for my stomach!,"I really wanted this to work, but after trying it a couple of times I had to discontinue using it as it gave me terrible heartburn!"
3,No pain reduction as yet,I didn't have any trouble with digestive issues or burping up the product (as I read about in other reviews). I have ben taking the full dose (2 per day) for over a week and no noticable pain reduction as yet. I am hopeful I will feel less low back and neck pain (both due to inflammation) in the next week or two. But glad I didn't have any of the digestive pain/issues others have commented on.
2,"Has not worked in two months, more inflammation instead","I purchased this hoping it would help. However, it has not worked in two months of taking it. Instead, I have more inflammation instead. I am willing to continue for another two months. But that's it."
2,did not meet my expectations.,"Tried these for joint pain but didn't see much of a difference, I saw more pain relief when I started juicing right after"
5,Little green miracle?,"My doctor recommended Zyflamend to treat general inflammation and to address my foot and joint pain. He said, ""Give me two months, we'll have you feeling better."" My pain was better in three days! I have been taking it daily for 7-8 months now and I swear I feel the difference when I forget to take it.Since, I've purchased other New Chapter vitamins and am always impressed. Now with Amazon's subscription service, I've found a no-hassle way to get them at great prices. Love it!"
1,:( wish it did work for me,This product was highly recommended by my orthopedic for osteoarthritis in both my knees. Unfortunately for me it didn't do anything even after taking 4-6 a day. I am glad to see that it has helped others. Not giving up until I find something that will work for me!!!
1,beg,"If you are terribly confussed then this is the movie for you, because you'll stay that way.After the first 10 minutes I started to skip foward in hopes to get out of the confussion, but not to be.The opening lines were -- people don't appreciate quality films anymore and they just want to see Paris Hilton fu--- films--, well I don't look for that kind of garbage but it seems preferable to this one."
2,translations don't capture RIlke's language,"When I read the glowing descriptions of Mitchell's translations in the first few reviews on this site, I expected translations that captured the meaning and pace of the poems AND Rilke's actual meanings. These translations definitely don't do the latter, and often don't do the former either. I majored in German in college so I'm somewhat familiar with the language, but wanted the English translations as aids where I didn't know the vocabulary; however, these translations are just irritating."
3,"Interesting, but not as good as the original.","The new card system was totally alien, if you are used to the older dice system. Not to say that it's bad, just different. It is more complicated and will probably take longer to learn. Oh, and the damage rules are really shakey. The conversion rules are very helpful though. I personally would rather play the older version but, since I really haven't played the new game yet (just read the rules.) I'm willing to give it a chance."
1,The original was far better,This new system is cumbersome and poor for gameplay. The diceless system takes much of the element of chance an enjoyment out of the game. I am sorry I ever bought it and can't rate it poorly enough.
2,oh my god!,"this movie was notting to the orignal absolutly notting,i almost fell asleep during it ,only the dinosaur roars kept me awake."
1,waste of money,"If you like dinosaurs-eating-people special effects, watch the first one and leave this on the shelf. The plot was a complete and utter joke. None of the main characters were worth saving and the suspense scenes were way too predictable. An awful, awful attempt to squeeze a few more bucks out of the genre. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,"Special fx. That's all they want, ain't it?","Why is it that films like the Friday 13th series receive such bad press and yet films like this one get rave reviews? Special effects, of course. They seem to be all that matters in films today. To heck with originality, character development, constructive plotting and innovation. Just give 'em lots of dinosaurs running around.Actually the first twenty minutes or so of this are okay and you think you're going to see a decent film. But then the dinosaurs take over and all you're left with are special effects, chase scenes, more special effects, more chase scenes, more special effects, and then a few more special effects thrown into the bargain.Oh yes, and there's quite possibly one of the tamest, most predictable rampaging-through-city sequences since time began.Maybe it's just as well dinosaurs have died out. If they saw this film they'd eat its makers. Hmm, mabe that's not such a bad thing."
1,Why do they do this?,"OK, is it just me that can't understand WHY Universal released a DTS version, Widescreen, obviously for filmphiles, that includes almost NONE of the extras found in the Widescreen Collectors version that doesn't offer DTS (best audio option is Dolby 5.1 on the version with all the goodies)?This is true of BOTH Jurassic Park and Lost World.....This is right up there with releasing a DVD with limited Extra Features that is supposed to be a Collectors Edition and then releasing another with more Extras a short time later! What is the deal with the studios?"
2,Worthless,It's been a while since I've seen a movie this bad. Lost in Space from 1998 was about as terrible as this. This movie was absolutely repulsive. The plot made very little sense compared to the book and the people did totally incompetent things in this movie that a normal person put in these situations wouldn't do. Don't even rent this at the video store
4,"Not as good as the first Jurassic Park, but still Awsome",This wasn't quite as good as the First Jurassic Park in 1993. But this is still the action packed And it's my second favorite Jurassic park. The lost world jurassic park came out in 1997. This one had even more dinosaurs. And much more carnovors eating people! YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM!!! Also see these films Jurassic park & Jurassic park 3.
3,"Okay, not as good as the first","This movie was okay. The first one is so much better, but this one is still not bad. I thought it was awesome when the T-Rex attacked a city! I still bought it because I love the movies. See it if you like the first, but don't expect it to be better.MPAA: PG-13Running Time: 129 minutesYear released: 1997"
2,This Movie Should've Been Lost,"Before we get to what's wrong with this movie, I thought it would be a nice change to go over the positives first. Are there any? I'm not sure. I think there are. Oh....right. Yeah, there's a few.Picture quality is outstanding.Sound quality is very good.Great special effects.Very cool extras.Unfortinatley, that's all that's good with this movie. The truth is that this movie STINKS! It's horrible. It's nothing even near to the original. In fact, I heard that the book is ten times better than the movie. I thought the story was terrible. Acting wasn't that great, either. And the last half of the movie is like a really bad Godzilla movie.All in all, not a very good movie. A great DVD, however. Just a terrible movie. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty close to it. It's definatley on the list. The only reason why this movie gets two stars is because of the DVD. The movie alone should get zero stars."
2,A LOST SEQUEL!,"The original was great, but this sequel stunk! The story musthave been written in 1 day, it was so stupid! Jeff Goldblum, waseven more annoying than usual, and had a black daughter, who wasa gymnast, yeah that's believable! Do yourself a favor, watch1 and 3, they're good! This #2 belongs in the toilet, with my#2!"
2,Made for money only!,"Do yourself a favor and skip this sequel. The first one was great, however; this sequal was only made for cheap thrills and money. Pass ""2"" up and go strait to Jurassic Park 3, which is actually pretty good."
3,Turn off your mind...,"...and ""The Lost World"" actually might surprise you with some entertaining moments, it's not horrible -but I must say I agree with many reviewers here; Why did the talented Spielberg even bother to make this sequel? This belongs among his ""weaker"" movies.My favorite scene however is when the ship crashes into land, something about this ""scenario"" is so... what's the word..? Well, when you hear the sound of the engine of the ship getting louder and louder -it's something so authentic about it. Well arranged and exiting. I think.But;I can't explain how on earth the big ""dino"" was able to get to the people in the controll-room of the ship, at least not without ruining the entire bridge. I mean, even the windows look intact. Hm..? A little embarrassing, check it out yourself.Other than that, nothing new, but good effects -and a quite entertaining sequel to a movie that could have been a lot better too."
3,New an Improved Dinos,I think that Lost World was a very good movie. Sure it wasnt as good as the first one but what sequels are? The lost world improved JP's dinos making them more realistic and fritening. Although the plot wasnt as good it was better then the third and made more sense.
2,PRETTY DISAPPOINTING,"I actually thought Jurrasic Park was somewhat over hyped/over-rated, but this movie was a lot worse. I was really disappointed when I left the movie theatre.....it was a waste of 7 bucks. Why? Because we had already seen the great special effects with dinosaurs in Jurrasic Park but this movie misused those special effects. This movie was just a big money maker that fed off the success of Jurrasic Park. Not worth your time or money."
1,not my best purchase,"The quality of the dvd was fine. Picture quality was good, case was fine. My son is a fan of the Jurassic Park series. This movie was the worst of the 3. I would not recommend buying this unless you are just interested in having the set."
2,A let down after the first,"but you will probably want this in your collection to go with the others. Goldblum makes the most out of a ""less than perfect"" script and there is a little too much violence for me. I liked the impending threat of the first movie, rather than just the graphic ""got ya"" in this one."
1,"""Godzilla"" without the sense of humor.",You saw all the good stuff in the original. Special effects and preachy environmentalism don't make up for a paper-thin plot and cardboard-cutout heroes and villains.
1,TOTAL FLOP !,"It's almost unbeliavable that, with Spielberg at the helm of this production, this movie is so bad, heartless, mercenary, I would say, one of the wors sequences ever done (rivalling, perhaps, with Speed 2. IT's a total flop."
3,Lackluster yes... But better than the awful original.,This movie was so-so at best. It actually had action and some suspense unlike the overrated original. There were way more dinosaurs and the T-rex was a lot more active this time. It was okay.
1,Anything for that big number,"If you love Sevillanas, don't bother with this CD. There's a well-known marketing ploy that I foolishly fell prey to: put a large number on the box and it will sell. Well, you don't get 56 Sevillanas! What you get is 56 pasos, running from one Sevillana to another, with no development, no movement through the four pasos and, worst of all, every single one of them in exactly the same tempo! It's boring as all get-out and it's ludicrous to try to dance to it."
5,ENRIQUE--THE GREAT--IGLESIAS,"This cd is so PHAT, I have never heard a remix cd quite like this one,it is very uplifting and exciting and now I can dance to all my favorite songs! MI ESPOSO is and always will be #1 and I am and always will be his #1...(fan) again much love for all mi esposo's fans and forall his cd's"
5,Fantastic Seasoning for Many Foods,"We use this product almost every day.... Only draw back is not the products fault. We live in the Philippine Islands so the product clumps from the dampness but we just break it up with a spoon and shake away... Favorite use is for our treatment of tofu which we freeze first, wring out and then spray with sesame oil and sprinkle it with Lawry's Garlic Salt and bake it till it's like crispy garlic bread and then we try not to pass out from gastronomic ecstasy when we eat it as a snack or with meals."
5,Treasure hunters,"Because its informative and a real good filmed documentary, with a no nonsense comment and review.So just as we wanted"
3,its good for something,it didn't raise my Libido as promised but thats ok it provided good proteineven after finishing the entire bag
4,Cute,"It's a nice quality puzzle. I did not realize by the description mix and match, that the whole animal did not come out, and that you mix and match their rear quarters. Although educationally sound, somewhat frustrating to an 18 month old."
4,puzzle,My grandson is 18 months old. I only have him twice a month. He seemed interested in the puzzle. I guess I thought it was going to have the whole animal that was the puzzle piece. He was having a challege putting the piece in right but didn't understand the individual piece color key. I have to see how he does with it.
3,"Tiny Pegs, small pieces...","Bought this for my daughter... the pegs are so small, as are the puzzle parts. Its a cute puzzle but not one of my favorites."
5,Makes an AWESOME ball pit!,"I looked everywhere for a ball pit for my daughter's toy room and came across this. There were two identical listings for this Intex pool except one of them (the cheaper of the two) had all poor reviews and the other had good reviews.The particular one that I chose had the bad reviews (2 of them). I'm guessing that perhaps the previous reviewers had been sold outdated versions of this pool. The pool that I received has a drain spout, does not leak, and seems to be VERY durable."
1,No drainplug,"I bought this pool because I read in the reviews and the product discription that it has a drainplug, the first one that I ordered did'nt have a drainplug. Amazon told me to order it again, but the second one didn't have a drainplug too. Now I will send this one back...again. And I really wan't to know wich pool all the people ordered who wrote in the review that the pool has a drainplug!!!!!!"
1,wth?,am a huge office fan. was not what i expected. am even a spader fan. even for free (w/ prime) this was not that good.
1,The many faces of Jim.. Or the one face he uses in every scene,"If you are in love with Jim from The Office you might like this. However, if you don't enjoy seeing this character make the exact same face for over 3 minutes then do not view this video."
4,Exactly the book I wanted,The book is in very good condition considering it's age; it was published in 1968. It still has the self-attached book mark. There is some humidity damage to the exterior with the actual pages being a bit warped and the price was very fair.
2,Display options limited,"Overpriced considering the cheap/missing components. PC laptops have more features and include a keyboard and LCD display for less money.No support for HDMI so forget about using this with your huge flat panel TV's digital inputs. You'll be fighting over scan unless your TV happens to have DVI in addition to HDMI. Sure you can fall back to fuzzy analog if your TV happens to have a VGA input. And no, that $20 DVI > HDMI cable won't make it work.Only supports SINGLE link DVI. This limits monitor size to 1920x1200. DUAL link is the current standard, it enables additional pairs of wires within the same connector for use with the largest monitors.As of 12/2007 I wouldn't buy this as it will shortly either be discontinued or upgraded."
4,Great Deal,"Apple Mac mini MB138LL/A (1.83 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1 GB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, Combo Drive)This was great price for a good product. Especially great for someone who has any monitor and keyboard already."
2,Not Good for Icing,"It looks like most people are using it for heat, so it may not matter. It does not get very cold and is useless, in my opinion, if you need to use it for icing."
2,OLIVER,"THIS MOVIE WAS ALRIGHT, BUT I WAS EXPECTING THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL MOVIE, AND IT WAS NOT. IF YOU WANTA SHORT VERSION, THIS WOULD BE FOR YOU."
5,Fantastic Idea,"The approach to curriculum maps outlined in this book is fantastic. It is not judgmental, but rather a tool to maximize the integration of curriculum between subject areas."
2,Stay with laser,"laser measurers far better than this unit. Measurements all over the place. Unit cannot seem to zero in on walls, solid objects. Difficult to figure out where it really is pointing due to lack of laser pointer."
1,Piece of junk,Does not work. Purchased for a handyman. He said he got vastly different ratings each time he measured the same space. This is unusable.
3,Enjoyable Meandnering,"An enjoyable enough romp, if a little directionless at times. I felt the book was trying to make some form of social commentary on a variety of issues, including:- the effect being utterly driven has on those around us- the distinction between natural/un-natural/synthetic/organic life- the need to attach a (perhaps religious) significance to criteria we don't understand.I count three or four main themes throughout the book, but I felt it ended without making significant commentary or statement about any of them."
3,"OK, it works","Its a nice little replica of the ones we had 40 years ago, that were built to last.Its built cheaply but this one functions OK with time and alarm working for our4 year old. Will it last.............. hopefully for awhile. It's more of a toy than aserious manual alarm clock. Rings loud and long if you wind it to the max.This old Marine hears it like the drill Sargent was standing on my head !!William"
2,Too hard to wind,I bought this alarm as a gift for my mother. She likes everything about the clock but she has to use needle nose pliers to wind it because there isn't enough room for her to get a good hold of the winding mechanism.
3,okay clock!,"Hard of hearing so the bells are not LOUD enough for me...but, it works and I love the clock itself...can't hear ANY digital clock alarms."
5,Historical scandals,"Concise and short chapters, packed with information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain as a student of history having to remember dates and historical characters, geography etc. Mr. Farguhar has to have collected this treasury for decades. Indispensable reading for any serious student of history.The paragraphs are short, probably, no more than 3 pages full of beautiful historical readings. No sentence is wasted. Highly recommended specially Mr. Michael Farquhar."
4,Erik Von Daniken Has Long Stated This.,Zecharia Sitchin is a God send for Erick Von Daniken and the those that read his books. For all the doubting Thomas es the 12th planet is a good one to read. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a little dry unless you have a great love for archaeology in which case you won't find this like a text book.
2,"Great, but ...","I used this product for several years. I like it because it holds the heat very well. However, I have just switched to a bead-filled pack because, after a few months of use (not even the whole winter), the plastic cracks open and the goop spills out at the place where it folds to fit into the microwave."
5,Can be used for hot or cold. Cold within 1-2 hours in freezer. Large bag can be used with other cold packs.,Can be used for hot or cold. Cold within 1-2 hours in freezer. Large bag can be used with other cold packs. I can insert other brand cold packs into it. Haven't tried hot yet.
5,Great Book,I picked up Carry Me Back based just on the subject and I expected a kind of standard treatment of slave trading as a business: so many people were sold to such and such states etc. This book does contain some of that but it has much more. Carry Me Back has an important argument about the nature of American slavery and sectionalism within the South. The book puts the slave trade at the center of American slavery showing how the money generated by the trade both reinforced slavery and led to doubts about its future. Deyle also shows how the increasing commodification of slaves altered the very way in which slavery was perceived by slaveowners and non-slaveowners. This is a must have for anyone who wants to understand American slavery.
4,Fun to read,"This is a delightful, light mystery. The characters would make lovable real-life friends. The descriptions of the colors and textures of the yarns make me want to run out and learn how to knit just so I can experience the fun these characters have with their hobby."
5,Just ordered another copy,"Actually I just ordered it about sixty seconds ago. Why? Because I somehow managed to misplace the copy I bought probably fifteen years ago. This is one of the best books I've ever read about the writing process, and I have reread it a number of times through the years. So I was a bit dismayed to discover that it's nowhere to be found now that I'm ready to read it again. Perhaps a 'ghost writer' needed it more than I did. :)Anyway, much like another reviewer said, I need it to help me over a rough patch here. When I remind myself of the steps involved, my writing goes much smoother. Can hardly wait until it gets here! :)"
4,"""Leave your sadness to the wind.""","This is a full blown Japanese musical complete with subtitles, people dancing and jumping and spinning. What sets it apart from other musicals is it's directed by Takashi Miike the unique genius god behind VISITOR Q, ICHI THE KILLER and THE BIRD PEOPLE OF CHINA.After a distinctly Miike stop-motion animation opening we met the Katakuris who have opened a nice bed & breakfast but unfortunately all of the guests end up dead. In order to not scare off any future customers they secretly bury the dead out in the woods.This movie is different, but not as strange as some of the reviews on here would lead you to believe. I also think the film is 15 minutes too long.Far and away my favorite musical number was ""I Love You."". I watched it at least eight times. I love that move Kiyoshiro Imawano does with his legs at the beginning of the song!"
4,Not a bad choice,"Function very well as described except the volumne is kind of low, I need to 'twist' or bend a little of the microphone in order to have lounder, clearer volumn on the other end. You also need to speak a bit lounder than usual. Otherwise, the receiving end will have a very weak, low voice volumn. The headset itself is very comfortable. Note: you need to purchase the amp adaptor to connect to a regular corded phone."
4,sturdy and comfortable,"We use these headsets at work, which is a hotline setup. The microphone part is very bendy, so if the caller is in a noisy atmosphere I can bend it closer to my mouth. The foam padding on the earpieces are not very soft, but I've been using my set for over a year now and it's holding up well.2011 update:After 4 straight years of using this headset 40 hours a week I finally had to replace the foam pads when the one ripped enough that it actually fell off. I should have replaced the padding ages ago, it's way more comfy on my head now."
5,NCIS: The Complet Ninth Season,"The whole cast is great, but I am a Gibbs fan. Hated that Kate went off to start another program (died in NCIS) but Ziva is great. Like I said before everyone is great...."
5,Winner,"I left NCIS when they unnecessarily killed off Kate. It took me a few years to return, but I did return. The 9th season has some well written crime stories. The cliffhanger was quite well done. As the new season approached, most of our apprehension of which characters would die were slowly alleviated w/snippets here and there. The writers took some time to develop Abby's character as a person, not just a quirky lab-tech. I do hope Dr Ryan returns to the series since she adds some depth to Gibbs.Long may NCIS reign atop the Nielsen charts!"
3,Letdown,Flashbacks and dream sequences take the place of a story this week. No one bothered to write a real script.
1,Sindi Says,I ordered and paid for this video. My computer refused to download so I was unable to view this video.What do I think of this ??????? I let you figure this out for yourself
5,Ncis spectacular,"Mark Harmon looks fantastic love the show watch it every tuesday night and the reruns when on . My parents and i can""t get enough gibbs baby. Mark harmon hasnt aged but we love the whole cast especially ducky"
5,Trench Art: An Illustrated History [Hardcover] Jane A Kimball (Author),"A wonderful book, I just started to get interested in Aeroplane Trench Art and with this book it is easy to get interested in many other areas of trench art. Not very much info on Aeroplane Trench Art, but the many other areas of collecting such as lighters, vases, etc. are enough to fascinate anyone who has an interest in these items. The book is written well and the pictures are very beautiful, showing some very unusual and rare pieces. There should be some high interest in this book I would assume, as these pieces are quite available on sites such as E-Bay and the internet auction circuit, so it is a collectible that is easy to obtain and start a nice collection as soon as you want. Also with the availability it is a collectible I recommend if you have interest. A high quality book, with fascinating information & the glossy photos are gems. Beautiful book I would recommend, a lot better than some I have on the subject."
1,"way overpriced, and poorly designed","I bought this product brand-new and used it less than a dozen times. In less than a dozen times, I had to replace the blending blade FOUR times because the the base of the blending blade that catches with the motor base is made out of HARD RUBBER. This hard rubber would strip anytime I put anything in the blender that any ordinary (and cheaper) blender could handle with no problem (e.g., soft frozen yogurt, banana pieces). Soon the blending blade base would strip even with the shaved ice in the blender, and the motor base wore down because of this.Do yourselves a favor and ignore the fancy Margaritaville marketing and get yourselves a real, durable blender for a lot less money. This product is USELESS!"
4,Great delivery while we were enjoying Christmas in Hawaii,We were staying at a friends condo on the Big island of Hawaii and wanted to buy them a gift to keep at the condo. We decided to go with the DM1000 concoction maker as we owned one back home in Canada. We tried to locate one on the island and could not find one anywhere so we checked on Amazon. Since it was just after Christmas we were not sure how long it would take to get to us. We ordered it and it was shipped to the Big island in 4 days!. We were very excited and the concoction maker worked as planned. The only downside was it did not come with the travel case. IT did not say it was supposed to come with the travel kit but ours did so we just assumed.this is not just an expensive blender. it is a must have
5,Great book,This book was recommended to me by a friend. I found it to be a very delightful book to read. This book is a biography but it reads like a great fiction novel. The life story of the author is an amazing story. I wish more books were as interesting and well written as this one.
1,OMG-what a jerk this woman was/is....,"I read this about halfway through and lost interst in the same ol' same ol'. After the events with ""Steve"" in L.A., the self-absorbtion of ole Georgie Girl, I was gagging.She had a chance to have both Joe and Steve permanently eliminated from her life..and was the martyr and 'let them live'. She made her bed and so she lied in it. I have zero sympathy for her, more of disdain. She had a good start in life...but ignored and chose a bad path. She kept returning over and over again to abuse and subjected and risked her daughters life too...very very self-focused-no consideration for others.Maybe many people live this way thus all the stellar reviews? I don't see it as a ""mob"" story..more of a low-life story of domestic abuse.Then towards the end(which I skimmed through) those who then embraced her after all her complicity in murder,etc.....makes me question them very much.Ugh..this is what gets rewarded in America...sadDon't bother with this one."
2,Lame,"I will give her this, her life is interesting but only because she kept making such stupid decisions. I was appalled to read how she uprooted her child as she went from man to man to man thinking each one would be better for her. Even more appalling was her admitting she used alcohol while she was pregnant. Hardly mother of the year material.Georgia, the author and subject of the book also seems to have a high opinion of her appearance as noted by the multiple references to her figure and 'beauty.' It wore thin.The writing was poor and the conversations quoted seemed way too cheesy to be real.The more I read the less I liked her and the more I realized that she was just as much of a sociopath as the men she slept with."
5,An extraordinary story from a very impressive woman.,"I knew about this book before I read it, since my mother was a friend of Georgia's who thought very highly of her. I knew some parts of Georgia's story, but I wasn't prepared for what I read! Georgia is to be congratulated for having taken the extraordinary difficulties of her life and translating them into a book that has the power to inspire others to transform their own lives as she has done hers. I'm glad this story made it into print. Georgia is a very impressive woman."
5,As life evolves...One can become a winner!,"This book is definitely a read for anyone whose life was ever impacted by abuse. Whether it be physical, emotional or from the abuse of drugs; Georgia Durante has painted the picture of how one can overcome any obstacle in life. Georgia may have made mistakes in her life from the manipulations of others from the dark side; however, she grew personally and professionally from her journey.This book will keep your attention until the very end because of the traumatic events Georgia sustained throughout the early part if her adulthood. She does not stand alone and she is a role model for all woman and men who have suffered at the dark minds and hands of another. You will wonder how she and her daughter survived...I say faith!"
5,A Brilliant Work With A Shining Purpose,"Ms. Durante is a perfect example of a talented, feminine woman succeeding in a man's world by using true ability, brains, and an innate sense about people, the ""E.Q."" (emotional intelligence) we hear so much about today. Her book is well-written, fascinating, fast-paced, and extremely thought provoking. It serves the dual purpose of providing great entertainment and also educating people about the folly of supporting an abusive relationship, or failing to take control of one's life on any level. It's a sure bet! Read it and take stock. It's a book you'll think about for a long time. Thank you Georgia for sharing your life lessons with us, we are all the richer for it."
5,"I search, and search for Grupo Primavera everywere, tks.Amaz","I heard on the radio several songs of grupo Primavera, but unfortunatly most of the stations in my area do NOT Mention the name of the group. Until someone told me who that was. and here Im buying the record... Muchas Gracias Amazon........."
3,Nifty little slices of island life,"Twenty-six short essays written during the author's first year on the island. At the time, Meras was the managing editor of the _Vineyard Gazette_ newspaper. Topics here include nature observations and interviews with such famous residents as writer Vance Packard and actor Joel Grey. Her views remain light and interesting, even though thirty years have passed since she wrote them. It would be even more intriguing to re-visit these sites today."
4,Blessing @ that time of need!!!,"This is Awesome with an capitol A!! I picked it up off my moms shelf after just sitting there for years and it was like picking up my heart again. He really makes you think and give you hope again....if your young, in love, or think your in love ....read it.....I just finished college and knew that God was calling me to a transition hes really directing my path.It feels like Prophet Jakes has watched my whole life!!! And put it on paper!!! The book is a match and has lit my soul A BLAZE!!!I also picked up T.D.JAKES- His Lady ....the promises for a sacred woman and its on time as well!"
5,Inspired by GOD!,"The Lady, her Lover, and her LORD helps the Lady to see everything from a clearer perspective. Bishop Jakes does something that many do not - he tells women to take care of self in order to be successful at taking care of those she loves. After reading this book, the Lady is able to understand the inner thoughts of her significant other through Bishop Jakes' honest, touching, sometimes humorous insights. There were moments while reading that I checked the cover for my own name in the title. (smile) He further (and most importantly) shows the need for developing and mantaining a healthy and intimate devotional relationship with our LORD. You will not close this book at the last page and be the same! Truly inspired by GOD."
3,"This book is hyped up, but you still should read it!","I think this book has some great points and is a good read - it definitely touched my heart and altered my perspective a little bit (about dealing with men). But the author goes a little overboard with all these metaphors - it drove me crazy! The book is also a little disorganized and repetitive. T.D. Jakes basically tells you what any other self-help book would, except he adds God to the picture. Don't get me wrong - this is a very good thing. As a Christian, it's hard to find books that use God as a backbone for EVERYTHING in a woman's life. But okay, pampering yourself, having diverse interests - that's general knowledge about ""loving yourself"". I was expecting some more deeper examples about loving myself and loving God. Not the best, but definitely worth reading! A recommended book about successful relationships is ""Getting to I Do""."
2,Not Easy to Get It Off,"Like other reviews, this cap does not easily come off. The problem I see is that the key does not fully turn 1/4 for the cap to come off. You need to force the key to turn 1/4 and hold the key with two fingers and use other hand to turn the cap. I guess you just have to get use to this. I wish some other company makes better locking cap. The cap states made in USA. What ever happened to USA quality?"
5,great product for fiber,This has little flavor but great crunch so you mix with other cereals to give a big nutritional/fiber boost. we have 2 gluten-free family members and this is a great way to get fiber.
3,Hmm,Not sure if this really works for my hair. I will try one more and throw in the towel. It may weight my hair down too much.
2,Not that great...,"I have only used Burt's Bees lip balm before, but I have heard so much about it that I requested this as a Christmas gift. Unfortunately, I was not impressed (and yes, I followed directions). It had an dirty, flat smell, that I didn't find particularly appealing. It was also difficult to wash out - it felt like it was the greasiest conditioner I have ever used even after thorough rinsing. Finally, my hair didn't feel any different than when I use my regular shampoo and conditioner. So that was three strikes, and this product is out."
4,Good Deep Conditioner for Coarser Curly Hair,"I have coarse, thick naturally curly hair (type 3b) that needs a deep conditioning at least once a month. The consistency of this cream is similar to vaseline and a bit greasy--which is perfect for my hair. If you have extremely fine or limp hair I would definitely recommend buying a lighter conditioner than this one. However, it works nicely for my needs.It's similar to using one ripe avocado and almond oil mixture (nothing else) on your hair as a deep conditioner (it leaves my hair incredibly soft). I actually prefer the homemade version, but keep the Burts Bees Avocado Butter on hand for when I'm out of fresh avocado."
5,Use this every day.,I exercise six days a week. I have a weak ankle from a couple ankle injuries I had as a kid. Use this every time I exercise for extra support. Works great.
3,Arrived fast but just an ok movie,The movie was alright and just took alot of the footage from the previous documentary Urban Struggle. Also the audio was kinda messed up during the interviews with Jack Grisham.
5,Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technology,I JUST SIGNED UP FOR SCHOOL. I AM SAVING ABOUT $ 55.00 BUYING IT ONLINE INSTEAD OF SCHOOL.
4,Refridgeration and heating technology,"The book came quickly to me, was in perfect condition, still looks and smells new, i am 100% satisfied with my purchase."
4,careful unpacking this decent item,"This works fine. The colors seem a little more drab in person but that's not problem. It didn't have a terrible smell like many foam products, so that is in its favor, as is the price. But its VERY tightly packed and I tore a little of the foam. I managed to smooth it out underneath the cover, and it works fine, but be careful."
5,A Christmas Gift,"Luminous was given to me for Christmas and was a quick three hour read. While the novel could have been dismissed as a typical ""follow your dream"" story, I felt something deeper was happening here. A few weeks later, I reread the novel and truly enjoyed the spiritual journey during the second read. This little book has a big message for our spiritual hearts."
5,A Novel for the Kennedys.,"I read Luminous right after John Kennedy, Jr. died. I was blown away when Jacques confronts the Crucifix to ask God why tragedies happened to him (actually, he screams at God). What the Monsignor told him, will be words that I'll treasure for the rest of my life. I swear, I thought he was talking to the Kennedys."
3,Be prepared,"Worth Reading. Some very disturbing issues and facts. Some may seem extreme but since the 60's we've seen the local farms disappearing, now corporate farms. We have schools that no longer teach. We seen family values disappear. We see American business deserting this country for greater profits in other countries. Who thought 30 years ago we would be killing over a million unborn babies each year.All we hear about today is being part of the global community. Who's behind the move; no one I know ot talk too. Don't be caught or surprised when we see this taking place.Read the book and decide for yourself."
4,Like old times,I use it everyday. It's great resistance and was a great product in the 80's. It still is.
3,"Not Bad, But Far From Essential","This is the third and final installment in Jerry Kramer's trilogy of books about the 60s Pakcers, following ""Instant Replay"" and ""Farewell to Football"". It's also the least interesting, especially when Kramer veers away from updating us on his former teammates and starts talking about his various up and downs in the business world. Without the central figure of Vince Lombardi (long deceased when this was written) and the drama of football to hang the narrative on, ""Distant Replay"" gets bogged down far too often in details that just aren't that interesting to read about. It's not a bad book, it's just not in the same league as the classic ""Instant Replay"" (which is still the best football book I've ever read) or even ""Farewell to Football"" (an enjoyable, if not as compelling, follow-up). Unless yourt one of those fans who simply must read everything associated with the 60s Packers, I'd skip this and buy myself a fresh copy of ""Instant Replay"" instead."
5,Tastes great,"This does not taste at all like ""cough syrup"" as the other reviewer stated.This is the best gum out there and I highly recommend it.I am not a plant, I live in Austin, TX and bought a pack of this in San Antonio - I just ordered a box on Amazon.This and the Lemon are the best flavors Orbit makes.John"
4,This one tickles the funny bone.,"I've read four books in the series now, and the concept of this one actually works. The more preposterous the situation, the more opportunity and capacity there is for humor. The digital artwork is wonderful, and the reactions of the passengers to Walter's ill wind must be seen.spudman"
2,Broken,"I recently received this item; my only complaint is the very first time I went to insert one of the studs, the stud broke from the pole. What good is one earring?Other than that, it's very beautiful."
2,DRIVE BY BOOK,"I thought this book was written by a cab driver who never really got out of the car to really discover the rich ethnography in Chicago. It's a drive by edition. He does not even roll the windows of his ""cab"" down to tell us about the rich smells of the city, the coffee roaster, the chocolate factory, the bitter nose stinging air of Gary Indiana rolling across the southside where it is met by the Argo cornstarch plant.This guy does not know Chicago."
4,Wonderful addition to the record collection,"I came across this band randomly through myspace (what a wonderful invention, allowing people across the world to unite through tearful blogs and spouting hate at ex loved ones) and they are truly magnificent. Admittedly I have not played their album for quite some time (then again when your collection is 500+ albums, you tend to forget a few) but whenever I do it is an aural pleasure that is perfect when you just want to relax and smoke a j and spend quality time in peace.Think of a chillout jazz band with trip hop influence and you have these guys."
3,Wishing for More of the Last,"I learned about 8mm after hearing (and being quite impressed by) the final track, ""Forever and Ever Amen."" Unfortunately, that cut seems to be out of synch with 8mm's characteristic style. Other reviewers have said it and I agree: 8mm has a solid sound, but you could play the album and every track would blend into the next forming a general 8mm stream. The tone, tempo, key, and subject matter do not differ significantly enough from song to song for individual pieces to stand out--with the exception of the excellent final track. ""Forever and Ever Amen"" is a wonderful piece of music and I hope to see more diversity in that vein from 8mm."
3,"Ok, but not great","I purchased this book for my 2 1/2 year old toddler. He didn't have any interest in it at all, and he loves books. I thought, since it is titled ""Four Special Questions"" that it would contain the actual questions. It does not. Might be better for an older child."
5,You need this one,"I just bought this book yesterday. I fell in love at the first sight to this book and this feeling doesn't cheat me..The cover really goes well with the content. I have more information about ingredients from all over the world. Once you open it, you'll be on board of a tour of ingredients from Asia to Afrika. For me, it is indispensable to have a good knowledge about the ingredients before jump start cooking! Glad I found this book!"
1,Awful,"I am stunned at the overwhelmingly positive reviews. If you are able to get past the fake apes, you will only have to endure increasingly embarrassing acting often put to inappropriately majestic music. I don't think I've rolled my eyes so many times while watching a movie. It so obviously tried to evoke emotion while never establishing a valid enough depth to the characters to warrant any feeling whatsoever. I loved the original Tarzan. It had a sort of innocent charm that this remake never comes close to achieving. The Tarzan character's continual grunting and roaring while with other people was especially tedious after a short time. While in the original version Tarzan was endearingly ignorant of normal human mannerisms, this Tarzan just comes off as lacking intelligence. I managed to watch it to the end but I found no redeeming quality to justify the 2h 17m wasted watching this silly movie."
5,Catherine is always GREAT!,"Mad Jack is another book that just goes to show how fun and love go hand and hand with a Coulter novel. Jack is another heroine that is bold, knows what she wants and goes after it full-tilt. I have wished plenty of times that I had the wit to spar as well as her heroines. Jack and Gray are wonderful together. Getting to hear from all of the Sherbrookes again was amazingly fun. The characters are rich and well formed. Don't miss this one if you like adventure,laughs,and a few worries. In the end you'll be able to say ""Thanks for the adventure and the love that shines through all of the characters, partners and friends alike."
3,disappointing for a Coulter novel,"Mad Jack lacks depth both in plot and characterizations. It's not up to Coulter's usual standard, but is as good as the average romance novel."
2,I really couldn 't get into it ; It didn 't mine attention,I have read a lot of your books you are one of mine favorite author i just had a difficut time reading this; it wasn;t like your other books'
3,Give her a break!,"I know this wasn't CC's best novel, but recently she has been bashed severely. I hope she doesn't read these reviews. It would make me never want to pick up a pen and write again. I enjoyed the continuation of characters and the fact that there were no rape scenes. I believe that if there were more time given to this novel it could have come together much better. I think it's the editors that need to take more time reviewing the manuscript before they publish the book. Catherine! read some of your earlier works and maybe you'll see what you are missing. I'd say borrow but don't buy this one. Here's hoping for a 5-star next time."
4,Laugh out loud fun,"I personly feel this is one of her best books. When i pick up a book to read i want to laugh and cry, i did both. I was enchanted. I agree she has written better plots but if you want to read somthing fun i recommend this book with its wacky little adventures."
1,What happened?,"I'm a big fan of Coulter, but this book was a huge disappointment. The plot was bad and so was the writing. I'm glad she wanted to bring back characters from the Bride series, but what was the purpose of them in the novel? My advice would be to wait until the library offers it. Not worth paying that much for a book you will never finish."
2,NOT as advertised..Beware.,"This was supposed to be a ""Deluxe Edition"", ""Gold CD"". What I received is a standard edition, every day aluminum CD.If you're looking for a deluxe Gold edition, this ain't it!"
3,Too much and a little dated,"If you want one book that introduces everything involved in print production this may be a good book for you. There is a lot of information in this book. More than any novice designer would need to know. For that reason I found it a bit overwhelming.It seemed some of technology mentioned was dated and the body text could get confusing at times. However, the call outs on almost every page really did a great job of summarizing the text."
1,Trade-offs,"There is good information in this book, but to find it you must dig through a heap of grammatical errors and typos. I wish I had known this beforehand, because I would not have settled for this massive mistake of a text book. Not to mention, this is the Second Edition. I would hate to see all the mistakes in the First. If we, as college students and/or designers, are going to spend time reading through this book, someone over at Wiley Publishing should have taken the time to do so - and make corrections. To find the information I need, I am not going to weed through broken sentences. I would suggest that you make every attempt to avoid this book."
1,Book was not proofread,"Absolutely every chapter has at least 10 misspellings or grammatical errors in it. It is quite funny how in the first chapter they stress how important it is to proof copy before it goes to the printer. Maybe the authors or the publisher need to read the book themselves. It is a very dry book and each chapter covers the main points with in the first few pages then repeats the topics over and over again through out the rest of the chapter. I would not recommend this book unless the person does not mind being distracted by misspelling, grammatical errors, and repetition."
3,too old,This has been a nice helpful book when coming new to the market of books. But now its old and really time for a new actual version!
5,excellent dairy replacement,"Love this stuff! I like it in tea and coffee - less ""soy"" tasting than regular soymilk and thicker than rice milk. Edensoy uses organic beans and rice and doesn't add a bunch of sugar (like Silk does). The little cartons are very handy for taking to work and I also appreciate that I don't have to worry about using an entire carton before it goes bad. I did subscribe and save for this product, but I've only gotten one shipment. It seems only sporadically available in this size at Amazon, so I may have to go back to getting it at the grocery store - and not every store carries it."
1,Poor Service and misleading pictures,"I am very disappointed when i ordered this i had the color in mind i wanted and boy was i wrong... I got a black one, not even what i ordered! Il will be returning mine as it not what i wanted. I have found another product that puts off a a sent threw out the house and this dont not even get close to it"
2,Waste money,"The package is broken and Iooks bad, i don't want to eat it anymore and have to throw it away.don't waste your money on it."
4,Good Till The Last Drop!,"I began this book intending to relax before having a nap. I ended up devouring the entire book, all thoughts of sleep having disappeared. It is rare when I haven't guessed the end of a movie or book by the 3/4 mark. Cook kept me guessing until the last chapter and successfully surprised me.In the book the unthinkable horror happens - a child is killed in a park. The suspect seems clear, but the police cannot determine a motive. Each character has fascinating reasons for wanting the case resolved by the next morning, when the suspect will be released if he hasn't confessed during the interrogation.The book also provokes thought on some hot issues. It doesn't blare them out like a blockbuster, it compliments the reader by presenting them as quiet offerings."
3,Shucks,"I suppose when some one creates something as magical as ""Breakheart Hill"", it's only natural for one to hope this magic is repeated in the works that follow. Now I'm not saying that an author should necessarily carbon copy his or her sucesses, but I am saying that an author has a certain responsibility to his previous work. And as good as ""The Interrogation"" is, it's just not good enough when compared to Thomas's previous novels. There's a certain lack of sincerity and authenticity to this book that the silly graphic clock heralding each new chapter can't fix. Thin characterization, weak ending...this reads like something hurried up and rushed to the publisher to meet a deadline. The best thing about this book? It won't be Cook's last."
1,Orders Canceled - Why ?,"Ordered 2 times, cancelled both times ? No reason, if not available, sayso, or remove ad!"
1,Armeggodan,I wounld't recommend M.C. Bolin's book Armageddon to anyone.The first reason is because the book is so much like the movie. When you read a book you want excitement. The second reason is the book is to specific about what they are trying to tell you. The third reason is that there is really know excitment in it at all. This is what I think of Armeggedon.
3,Swans,"The Summer of the Swans is okay. I really don't like the main idea (to find Charlie).The characters are all very different. For ex. Sara is stubborn and Aunt Willie is very strict. Charlie's like Sara because he can be stubborn too. Unfortunately Charlie is mentally disabled, so he can't talk. Wanda, Sara's older sister, is like Sara's polar opposite. Wanda's very perky and beautiful.Overall The Summer of the Swans is quiet emotional. I think this book would be good for all ages."
1,Do Not Read This,"Aunt Willie is now the guardian of all differnt ages. charlie is ten years old and is mentally handyecpped. Sara is fourteen years old and looks after charlie. wanda the oldest sister is nineteen years old she basically minds her on bussiness through most of the story.One day charlie decided to go off to see the swans. Then he gets lost in a ravine. sara,joe melby, and her friend Mary go looking for Charlie. Everybody especially Aunt Willie expects the worst. But they find Charlie in a ravine.My favorite character is Boysie because he did not bore me like all the others. Also because he is alot like me. He is lazy and sleeps alot. I think he is the most interesting character.I did not like this novel because it was too long. If it wasn't for Boysie, this would be the worst novel ever. My teacher put me through this torture. I would have rather read ""The Ugly Duckling."""
1,The Summer of the Swans,"It was boring and pointless to read. The plot did not hold my attention and was uninteresting. I would suggest to other young readers, such as myself, to not read this book. Very few exciting events occured. Also, it was extremely predictable."
1,Don't read it!,"Don't read this pointless book. It's not exciting. I was bored. I caught myself sleeping during the story because it couldn't keep my attention. Too easy to figure out what was going on. Too much repetition, it might be improved if the story could just move forward more quickly even if that meant a shorter book."
3,"Boring then exciting, but short!!!","I had read other reviews on this book and wanted to read it for summer(since it was on my reading list.) It was boring through the first chapters, untill Charlie gets lost. Charlie is a boy that is in a way disabled. He had diseases when he was three years old that made him very sick. He hasn't talked ever since he was three. When Charlie gets lost all the earlier problems are revealed to tell the truth. It's a nice book, yet kind of short. You could read it in 2-3 days if you wanted. I enjoyed this book, but I wish(for some reason) that it would talk more about the swans. What happens to them? They go to the high school and that's the end??? I mean they cause the big problem in the story. I would recomend it to grades 3-6."
4,A good novel that's not really about swans.,"I give the novel ""The Summer of the Swans"" four stars because it is an insightful and suspenceful story. The novel is based on a fourteen year old girl's summmer that changed her life. The story has very descriptive characters so you can actually visualize them. The plot of the story was exciting, adventureous and dramatic. It made me feel grateful and lucky for the things that I take for granted. The swans are not really character but symbols of the change that was coming. The suspense comes when the main character's younger mentally handicapped brother has gone missing in the woods. So if you're looking for a a good drama novel, this is the one for you!"
3,matthew's review,"I thought the book was good.The book was about a 14 year old girl, named sara, in her 14 summer and it all acts the same as last year, but to her there was something different.she thought it was boring this summer,even though it was the same as last summer.there was realy nothing about swans.charlie didn't talk but he was important.even though it acted like sara didn't like him, sara cared for him.at the end sara realized she was just like the swans."
3,summer of the swans,Well I think that charlie wasn't a very smart little boy when he decided to run away. Also he was so mad at sara because she would not let him go see the swans. Also he had ran away I think that sara was just being crazy and acting like she didnt know what was going on.also charlies watch was broken now how in this beautiful world is going to get home.And so sara came looking for charlie and then they couldnt find him so she had asked joe melby what really happened to the watch.
4,Summer Of The Swans,This Book IS Good But The is not that great and seems like their is more and is about a boy who gets lost looking for the swans
1,Bad company to do business with!,"Would never recommend doing business with Savio Engineering. Poor quality products. Absolutely no quality control. And should you receive a defective product like I did, once its in your hands, Savio believes its a warranty issue and you need to fill out the forms and send it back at your expense. Not a responsible manufacturer and they also misrepresent the capabilities of their products, which I believe is intentional. Plan on filing a complaint about their false advertising with the FTC. Avoid at all costs."
5,Essential for all instro-manaics!,"File this one right between your Los Staitjacket and Link Wray disks! An outstanding effort by one of the great promoters of pure rock and roll guitar. If Martians ever invade your house and want to know what rock and roll sounds like, or you need to put something in a time capsule so future generations know- hand them them disk!"
5,Inspiring yet tragic first-hand experiences from GLB teens.,"A teen's life is already crowded with too many questions. Most are trivial, but one can be very important. Just this year, I told my mom that I thought I was gay. I had heard about this book (ironically enough) on the Internet, so I asked her to buy it for me. The book practically saved my life. Its pages are filled with touching and emotional writings by gay and lesbian teenagers who questioned themselves and, for the most part, lived to tell about it. I'm 16. It confirmed some of my fears about being gay, answered a lot of my questions, but most importantly, gave me the courage to live. I recently told my close friends that I am gay. They don't care. Now I'm thinking about writing my own story, so my experience can help the next teen choose to live, just as I did"
3,JUNGLE DUMS..........,"THE MUD People are about to perform the usual human sacrifice, when out of nowhere - lo! A red ball [croquet I recall] comes whizzing out of nowhere and lands in their midst! Fascinated, they abandon the victim and trace the trajectory back to its origin - a decaying, vast, ancient mansion 'in the jungle'. THEN AN astute member finds a trunk filled with rather lovely period costumes [circa 1920 ish], and as they start donning the robes - they transform the action into something along the lines of Gatsby revisited ........ Hmmmm a quaint concept - and it does hold attention!ODD little movie from the early 70ties with Sam Waterston, Salome Jens, Kathleen Widdoes, even Ultra Violet. [An EarlyJames Ivory for your collection]Superb Costumes and Art direction - if you're in a quirky ""Brazil type"" mood."
1,a premise that holds promise lost in bad writing,"When I read what this book was about, I thought it sounded interesting - what would we do if we thought we weren't going to live. However, I found the interesting idea was way overshadowed dull characters and writing. The characters are either goody/goody or someone absolutely hateful - very one-dimensional and totally unrealistic. As for style of writing, I felt like the book was written for pre-teenagers - very, very simplistic, although the subject matter certainly is adult. The ending read like some kind of inane dream that the author had one night, embellished with some kind of misdirected how-can-i-make-this-seem-spiritual mythology which seemed to me to be just asinine. I was bored from the beginning but kept reading, hoping it would pick up. Alas, it never did - I was embarrased for the author."
2,A Big Disappointment,This book in not anywhere near Ms Brown's usual standards. Lacklustre story based on an unbelievable premise. Too bad!
3,Poor craftsmanship of handle,"I was disappointed in the quality of the handle of this knife. I have purchased several Buck knives, including the Buck 500 and the Buck 503 Prince that I bought for my grandson, and they have always been well made. I thought about returning it, because I'm pretty sure Buck would have replaced it, but understanding this is a ""carrying knife"" and not collector quality, I decided not to hassle with it."
5,Very nice knive,"I don't write reviews, but I will make an exception for this knive. This is a nice knive, very well made. It has a very sharp blade,the weight is excellent. It is not a tiny knive, but it fits nicely in my pocket. If you like well made knives at a good price, buy this knive, you will be happy you did."
3,Good program for beginners,"A very good suite of applications with a great interface that is simple to learn and use. The video editing parts of the program are again, very easy to use. If you have no plans or desire to do any intermediate video editing work, such as video overlays, then I would highly recommend this program. Lot's of great features and a very stable product."
1,"Very, Very, Slooooooow--Disappointing","Beware!!!! You will spend all day editing photos and video and not accomplish much. We have Windows XP, 3.0 GHz, 512MB RAM, 120 GB HD. Everything else runs smoothly and quickly except this program. This was my first digital media software. I should have done more research. Since then I have switched to Pinnacle Studio Version 9 for video editing--I highly recommend this alternative. Currently, I am looking for another photo editor. Don't waste your money on Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 like I did. Aside from it's slowness, the program itself is mediocre at best."
1,"If you have Roxio 5, why upgrade?","Slide show creator module is inferior to the Video Impressions (Arcsoft) included in the Roxio 5. I never could get the Sound Module to work; I had to record using Windows Creative Recorder and then import. If you're using 600x800 screen resolution for other programs, you'll have to switch to higher resolution each time you access Roxio 7. I don't understand what all the 4 and 5 star reports found so useful; I notice most of the faorable ones were written early in the year."
2,Not Useful,"I bought this product to burn CD's (using CD-R disks). It didn't work for me. After a lot of research I discovered (from Microsoft) that CD's burn better at a slower speed, so I set my system to 48X and it worked. Tech support from Roxio was confusing, as they supply lots of (for me) useless documentation. I could have saved my money, and used Windows or any AT&T Yahoo! CD burners."
2,Meant for novice who doesn't know any better...,This software isnt worth the money it costs in my opinion.Do yourself a favor and go buyNero 6 Ultra Edition (Nero Burning Rom). You will be much happier.This software is pretty much designed for the novice in mind.There are many better tools that can be used instead.
5,"excellent video, picture and music organiser",I have had this before in fact i have easy creator 4 thru 10 i find that ver. 7 is the easiest to use and works well all the way up to and including the dreaded windows vista
1,Stay Away,"Like the others who have given this one star, I had major problems with the installation. Following installation my system wouldn't recognize any of the optical drives. I had to go through the Restore Point procedure to bring them back. Even then, I had trouble with Roxio loading, other software ceased working properly (to the point that I couldn't back anything up to optical drives), and I finally had to do a clean install of Win XP.The sad part about this is that these are known problems with ""workarounds and fixes"" on Roxio's site. Unfortunately the fix didn't work for me.I feel terribly burned by Roxio and, since software is unreturnable, by Amazon."
3,terr in fam,the mother n father in this family needed to toughen up and take control of there family n stop here from hitting her mother. come on she is only 14 yrs old but ur foot down i am not saying to beat her or anything but a old fashion butt spanking could help. but if her problem is more of an mental issue then get her sign in a mental hospital n help.
1,Never Worked,"Everytime I would turn this thing on it would blow a fuse in my house!I've tried it at my home and several others' homes, and it would stay on 5 minutes tops!I hate it."
5,Perfect match of verse and pictures,"According to my trusty and well worn Concise Oxford Dictionary ""exquisite"" means ""of consummate excellence or beauty"". I looked the word up because it was the word that came to mind whilst enjoying this work. Much pleasure to return to many familiar poems of Robert Frost eg MENDING WALL and STOPPING BY WOODS ON A SNOWY EVENING and to discover unfamiliar gems such as BEYOND WORDS. But the photos too have a clarity and depth and composition not to mention colour which helps the contemplative richness of Robert Frost's words. And not a human in sight! Especially rewarding work for those moments of repose, of calm, when one wants to escape the hurly burly, the flim flam, the gibbering and bustle,and drift, dissolving into the natural world. But, returning to the world of commerce, I can tell you this book is a bargain."
3,Centauri National Socialist Party Book 3 of 3,"Unlike the ""Psi Corps."" trilogy, I would only recommend this series to Babylon 5 fans who want the rest of the story filled in. Peter David has done a fine job of updating the German war machine of the 1930s to the Centauri Republic. The book, to its credit, does come with a few surprises (which I won't spoil here). All in all, a good book if you like B5 and reading sci-fi. Not exactly a stand alone series, but it does quite well in drawing upon historical realities. Look for Durla's speech to the Centauri people during Londo's first visit to the Tower of Power (I personally hate that name). Also, Vir's rise to Emperor... can anyone say ""I, Claudius""? Read this book only if you are interested in the details of the story."
2,SPEECH OF RICHARD BUSTEED,Quality of print was very poor - hard to read in some areas.Delivery was rapid.
5,The only quilt book I'll ever need!,Quilts!Quilts!!Quilts!!! has all the information I need to create my own masterpiece quilt. The book's photographs are awesome and inspiring! The directions are clear and concise. There are so many patterns I can't decide which one to make first.
1,Disappointed,"Had read several positive reviews of this book and chose to add it to my quilting collection. Then I decided to make one of the quilts - Drunkard's Path - knowing it was one of the more difficult patterns. However, being an experienced quilter, I thought I was up to the task. Well, the directions from beginning to end were not only poorly explained but in several instances incorrect. Some of the fabric measurements were so off that even though I had purchased extra amounts, I had to go back and buy additional fabric. If I could give this book a zero rating I would."
3,More of a pattern book than a complete guide,"It's an okay resource book, but I found most of the book consists of quilt patterns instead of a guide. I much prefer ""Quilter's Complete Guide"" by Fons and Porter or ""The Quilter's Ultimate Visual Guide"" by Ellen Pahl as a guide on how to construct a quilt from start to finish."
3,just a doll,"It is just a doll actually, you can take out the CD case from the frog queen so you get one CD case and one doll!!!"
4,it is a good model of a brain injured kid and their family,"It is a well written story showing how much a brain injured person suffers along with their family. This book tells you that people who are brain injured can get better and can overcome this setback. In order to overcome this though many people need to spend hours and hours each day, every day until their job is done."
2,Someone Has to be Kidding,"This appears to be a good product and free of toxic chemicals, with biodegradable packaging. But the cost per oz of the cleaner is unbelievably high. I had assumed (as is often the case with Amazon) that at approximately $15 for the 4oz bottle that the shipment would be more than one bottle - making the cost $3 or $4 a bottle which is reasonable. $15 for 4oz of eyeglass cleaner? I am keeping it as a monument to overindulgent spending."
4,Great Cleaner,"I purchased this for my camera lenses. It worked so well on my lenses, I've also started using it on the screens of my laptop, phone and tablet. Cleans well without leaving a residue."
5,Magical,I sprayed this on my glasses and made a wish while rubbing them with a soft cloth and a genie appeared and granted me 3 wishes. I was also very pleased that this solution worked as well as others have noted. Cleans your glasses and doesn't leave streaks.
2,jacket review,I am very disapointed with this jacket - it was a bit pricey and you'd think that would coincide with good quality - it does not. The sewn-on letters are unraveling and not just one of them. Poor value.
4,"Worth the low, low price.","Knowing from the other reviews in what to expect in the shipping of the train table, I was pleased. It did have a couple of dings in it, but it was still usable. It was such a great deal, even with the shipping issue. I probably would have been less pleased if I hadn't known the issue from the other reviews. The kids love it. I love the trains off of my coffee table and in the playroom."
5,FIVE BEACON REVIEW,"Tracy Michaels is a single mother with self-determination and spunk.... even if she doesn't know it. After a life changing event, Tracy is forced to come to terms with her own past in order to protect her son's future. With the help of her friends and one great police Sergeant, Tracy will take control of her destiny.This meticulous research done for this book was obvious and impressive. The background information on rape standards was very well put together and fit perfectly into the story. And I loved the character Sergeant Reese Sanders. He was wonderfully flawed, an unlikely hero on the verge of self-destruction. Even though you are introduced to the perpetrator early on in the story, there is still the element of suspense and you will find yourself rooting for Tracy right from page one! This author has just been put on my list of favorites. I will be looking for many more books from Brenda Hill-Seaman and recommend that everyone else does too!"
1,Dumb economists get the most attention,"Once again the famous Milton freedman who proved the Phillips curve for his Nobel prize is wrong. Not only did the Phillips curve get totally debunked, but the rest of his ideas failed to account for reality as well. When will people give up on Monetarism, it's not real and no one even considers it valid anymore in academic economics."
1,everybody has their price,Capitalism is the most barbaric of all religions. Department stores are our new cathedrals. Our cars are martyrs to the cause. And you too will learn to live the lie.
5,capitalism and freedom,"This book, written in the 60's, has correctly predicted what has happened to our economy and freedoms in the last 40 years! What to expect in the future cannot be taken lightly.Milton Friedman should be a required read by all college students and possibly high school. At least those that can read."
5,Read it twice,"A fantastic piece of literature. The concise nature of the book belies the depth of knowledge and purpose of Friedman's writings, but then that is what he intended. I find I take more out of the book each time I read it. A must for any serious economist and to any one willing to gain a clearer picture of the political economy and the forces at play.Do yourself a big favour and read this and if are a socialist then be warned, the truth will hurt! (If Mises's work has not already done that)"
5,Good,"The protein is excellent. I can't say I saw any drastic results, but I definitely gained some muscle. I used it while working out on P90X. It's much better than the protein that they recommend. I would give 4 stars because I hate HATE the taste of the chocolate, but I don't want to confuse anyone or make them think this isn't a great protein. All I have to say is get the Natural instead of Chocolate. You can mix that one with juices or other drinks."
1,Why In God's Name............,"would anyone purchase any product with absolutely no labeling or nutritional information anywhere in the ad? If you get sick or get NO benefits from the product, blame yourself for not investigating."
5,AMAZING.... KEEPS MY STUBBLE LOOKING STELLAR... A+++,"Great design. Great function. I do not use any of the attachments. Just the raw trimmer.Works amazingly easy. Just swipe your stubble every 1-2 days for that constant 5-o'clock shadow look. Works better than any others i have used. Battery is still going strong, months after my first charge. Amazing. Light weight and easy to throw into your luggage for trips and vacation. Highly recommended."
2,Average,"i've had it for three weeks now. it does what it should do, trimming is done clearly, but some cons are:-the material used in this device seem to be of poor quality-the trimmers size is relatively small, so it may take longer than usual to shorten your bear-if you hold it in some bad direction, and/or use more pressure than needed, it can easily hurt your face or neck's skin, leaving little scars."
3,great trimmer - just adequate attachments,"This trimmer is excellent! Feels solid, cuts great and holds charge a very long time.The attachments are just adequate. They feel flimsy and I know they will break long before the trimmer wears out.I would give the trimmer 5 stars and the attachements 2 stars. You really need the attachments.But what do you expect for 24 bucks."
3,Needs better battery,"I am happy with the price and the trimming performance of this trimmer. I am disappointed that when I charge the unit overnight, the red light never goes out to indicate that charging is full. The trimmer, which I use once a week, does not hold a charge but for two trimmings of a light beard."
2,Quit running after 7 months,"This product started off strong and worked well initially.After 7 months, and a couple of months off because I had my beard & mustache professionally trimmed, it would not work, no matter how long I charged it up. Now it is basically a paperweight.I recommend you buy something else."
4,Very good phone cover!,This Razr phone cover is a great product. Hard shell protects the phone and outside leather keeps it soft and fashionable. Easy access to side buttons...protection on hinge is not there but overall protection is the best for any cover I've seen for this phone....keeps keys and screen open so no dust gets pushed up against them....overall a good product for the money.
4,like it,I cut off the back button for the belt clip on thing. And now it fits well in my pocket. Don't know about the leather scratching off (only had it for like 1 week) but so far so good
5,Great product - unbelievable price,"Have been using product now for about 3 months. Looks really good, fits perfectly, can be taken off/reinstalled easily, has protected the phone well each time I've dropped it, and was dirt cheap. I can't ask for more! Definitely recommended."
5,Great product for the price.,"Yeah, it is just a cell phone cover, but for the price it is very high quality."
1,Horrible filtering,"I can only second what John Grabowski wrote already about this set. I came to it thinking that Membran had done some fine releases already in my collection, usually of archival vocal material. Instead, the treble has been consistently removed, presumably under the mistaken impression that people wanting recordings of this period can't tolerate scratchy surfaces. So a good deal of musical content has been removed.Don't buy this. Yes, other releases of this material will cost you more, but you'll also purchase something that's actually listenable. And as a big fan of Glorious John, that's the important thing."
5,"It's crazy, fun, and funny!","These guys are accordion militants. If you want to hear what ""An American Band"" sounds like on accordion -- or ""The Devil went down to Georgia"" -- or any of a host of other songs -- these are your guys. They've risen to the challenge of Rock-n-Roll on accordions using miked reeds, distortion filters, pedal effects, and all the other stuff that normally gets applied to electric guitars, and the fact that they're incredibly talented doesn't hurt either.They are also local legends. If you want to listen to the band that organized a march on city hall to get the accordion declared the official instrument of san francisco (which was successful, by the way) these are your guys. Well, these guys and polkacide.They also play a lot of very funny original songs, and a few very traditional-style accordion tunes. They never take themselves too seriously -- the cover tunes are very funny as parodies -- but they are without a doubt one of the best sets of musicians ever to pump air."
5,Outstanding - provides social and historical contexts,"This is a great book on art. So many times when I look at art books, what I find are commentaries on the ""artistic"" qualities of the paintings. You know, books gushing over an artist's use of colors and light effects.Instead, the authors of this book analyze the social and historical contexts of the paintings. Great paintings are rarely purely decorative objects, but instead have some sort of message embedded within them. Objects within paintings typically have symbolic significance, and this book really helps the viewer understand the ""message"" in a painting, rather than concentrate upon technical aspects of artistic methods."

2,boker ceramic blade titanium handled knife review,"this knife is somewhat of a luxury item. the blade comes sharp, but is very brittle. not something you want to drop on a tile floor, and not something you want to pry anything with in any way. it is stylish, but there were imperfections in the handle when i got mine, one side was deeper than the other. i dont use it regularly because im afraid of damaging the blade. definitely not worth the price tag, unless you have money to burn."
5,Love it,"GREAT PRODUCT!!! I make butterscotch blondies from time to time. And you girls now how sticky butterscotch is. In the past, I have had to butter the pan, carefully press down the aluminum foil into the pan, careful not punchering the foil. Then buttering the foil, well all that prep work is a thing of the past. i do spray a little bakers desert spray on it and that is it. I adore this product."
4,Corelle,It is a nice pattern but not my choice--it is the pattern that my son wanted. And it is a nice pattern for a young man. They arrived in good condition and were packaged very well. My son is very happy with them. I had recommended Corelle to him since that is what I have and it has served me well the last 30 years.
2,"Set okay, glasses bad.","glasses were bad, cheap. rest of the set was good. design was nice enough. overall unsatisfactory because of the glasses."
1,Description / Item does not match photo on web site,"The photo on the website shows 5 different pieces - the set only has 4. Also, the description does not indicate that the mugs included with this set are made of stoneware, not the corelle material."
2,Poorly manufactured,The design was missing on some of the plates. I was really disappointed since that is the reason I got the set and it's the only thing that gives them any type of appeal. Its a big package so it's not worth it to return it and wait for another one so I am stuck with it. Guess I am not ordering plate sets anymore from here.
1,Very bad packinging,"If you would like to give a gift then just NO NO. It came up with an ugly package. The dishes inside were greasy !!!! Brand new, suppose to be....Wow, I can't believe it! Amazon sold this junk to me! Fortunately Amazon have a great return policy."
5,Outstanding,"I just received today and have watched the entire DVD! Paul Grilley presents the Chakra theory clearly and his presentation, as usual, is great. I highly recommend to anyone searching for more information on chakras and meditation."
5,Techno mages,I like techno mages and The book gripped me. I really couldn't put it down. The five more words required
3,New for its Time,"I listened to this when I was quite young and it was a bit off the edge of what Pink Floyd was doing, but not quite as bizzare.Its a mix of traditional sounds with edgy tunes. This is somewhat within the realm of Barkley James Harvest and unheard Golden Earring."
4,Drifters - Great historcial story,I enjoyed the historical aspect of the book. Especially since it was a part of history I had never heard or read about. Such a interesting part of our country's history that is not included in any school history books that I have ever come across.A must read for history lovers...
3,Unusual film for connaisseurs,"Though apparently trash, this film is actually a very sophisticated S-M fantasy with strong, deliberate psychoanalytic overtones"
3,"Model is good, needs modern data","The model makes sense, but the data is horribly out of date (interviews were conducted 30 years ago). I'd like to see if the model holds in a modern context."
3,Not the ones in the hospital,"I still had a few from the hospital and these are not the same, they are rougher. They are best used when wet if using them on the baby. I will keep them in the diaper bag and other places that need cleanup after the baby in case the wet wipes run out."
4,Great pee-guard for baby,"These cloths are super absorbent, and you can tear them easily to get a smaller sized wipe. I put one over my infant son when changing him to manage spray-pees. They aren't very soft but when moistened with water they are great for wiping. Much better choice than the standard commercial baby wipes, which don't absorb much of anything and typically contain chemicals and alcohol."
1,Not Good for Baby,"I bought these to use as baby wipes, because the description says ""Commonly used in hospitals for changing newborns."" While in the hospital when my baby was born, the hospital did provide dry wipes for us (that was the type of wipe I was looking to buy). But these are not the same as the ones the hospital provided - these are much too rough and coarse to use on a baby's skin. If you are looking for wipes for baby, do not buy these."
3,"Not the hospital quality I was hoping for, but works ok","My infant was in the hospital at 2 months old and one of the nurses told me that the dry wipes were much better for diaper changing than the wet wipes that had many chemicals in them. They gave me a lot of wipes upon leaving the hospital and I grew to really like them. These were definitely not as soft and pliable as the hospital wipes. They worked ok and I'm using them, but I need to figure out what they use at the hospital and buy those."
4,"GOOD BUDGET FINDER, BUT NEEDS EXTRAS",This is a very good portable fish finder for the price. Logical pre-sets and user friendly set-up and use make it my best choice. I bought a SONY charger and 8 NiMH AA batteries to go with it.[ASIN:B000OOQ7MW Sony BCG-34HVE4 Quick Battery Charger with Car Kit].I can use the AA batteries in other devices when I'm not fishing so I didn't mind the cost. I also bought a padded carrying bag for $15 at a local shop and that keeps everything safe and in one place.
5,Guide fits France in the palm of your hand,"For anyone, like me, who is hesitant about visiting France simply because they do not speak a word of French, no longer need to be. Jill Butler has made it easy with her new book, ""Rendez-vous with France, a la Jill Butler"""" which is full of colorful illustrations, vocabulary, helpful pronounciations, and tips to make your visit more enjoyable. Not only is the book helpful when visiting France it also offers helpful hints when ordering at your favorite French restaurant. This charming book is small enough that it can fit in a travelers pocket and is divided into sections so the user can access information quickly. For anyone longing to travel to France this book in an essential element to traveling, shopping, and eating in France. And I highly recommend you buy this book. ..."
2,Unrealistic and Boring Murder Mystery,I found it to be boring and totally unrealistic for a cookie baker turn dectective. It was not even funny at all. Took I could to finishReading the story. The only best part were the cookie receipes which I baked to try them. Don't waste your money !!!
2,Lack of Pictures,"I think this book is not meant for me. There was too little pictures. Dishes that have vegetable that i didnt like. Lack of recipe for pasta. i guess i dont know much of about italian food, but most of the food doesnt sound good because of whats in it. Personally i do not recommend it."
3,Huge Watch & Unbelievable Retail Price,"I didn't realize this was a self-winding watch, and was shocked by the size and thickness. Even at 6'1"", 200lbs, this watch would dwarf my wrist.Also, generally unimpressed with the chrome dial markings. It looks good in the photo, but looks kinda cheap in the real world.Having reviewed a couple of these marked-down watches, I feel that the Suggested Retail Price for these watches is ludicrous.Immediately returned the watch, but - unlike many other Amazon items - had to pay for insured shipping. (Ouch!)"
5,This will solve all of your pool leaf woes!,We went with this particular leaf eater because of the other positive reviews. I concur with all the good things said about this product! It was very easy to assemble and is much sturdier than I anticipated. I ordered an extra leaf bag so I could work continuously. We have lots of trees around our pool and get tired of so quickly clogging the pump when we use the vacuum. This took care of it! We used it at opening for a ton of leaves. Another benefit is it kicks up all the fine particulates that are too small to get trapped in the bag so the filter can grab them. I can see us using this product for many years to come.
5,If you want just one book about Aircraft Carriers,Capt. Macintyre has done a 1st rate job on the new capital ship and its role in the 2 world wars. Its a hell of a good story and he does it honor by his telling of it.
5,WONDERFULL SCIENCFICTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you like movies and books like The time machine and Back to the future then I have one thing to say to you............. GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!It is full of adventure,love,danger,and excitement. I had a great time reading it and so will you."
3,Not as easy as it looks,"Works good for drawers on the top of a base cabinet, but it is easier to use a spacer for multiple drawers w/o face frames."
4,"A great view of human nature, and ourselves","I wasn't really sure what I was getting when I rented ""High Fidelity."" What I got was one of John Cusack's best performances, as the insecure, brooding, introspective record shop owner.I likely was one of those vinyl geeks that populated Cusack's store in my earlier years, though I don't recall ever getting quite so cranked up as Jack Black did on that customer who wanted the Stevie Wonder record.Black by the way is obnoxious as hell, but here it worked brilliantly. Todd Louiso as the painfully shy co-worker was also good, and the list of fine supporting actors made this film exceptional.Cusack's Woody Allenesque discussions about his screwed up life with the viewers lend some insight to just how he got where he did, and it seemed like everyone I know who saw it caught some of themselves in there.So if you've ever wondered why people keep around stacks and stacks of vinyl, here's a possible answer...just don't start thinking institutionalization for them."
1,horrid,I'm not a Cusack fan. At best he's tolerable.THis movie was boring and painful to watch. It's about a lame depressed guy and his annoying friends with awful taste in music. was it supposed to be a comedy?
5,one of the Top Five romantic comedies of all time!,"This is an extremely smart romantic comedy, which combines insightful writting with true acting. The film follows Rob, a man who loves music and ranking things (even breakups), on his search for a more meaningful love."
4,From a man's point of view...,"And I loved it. Although I have not read this book, am a big fan of Nick Hornby. Am constantly amazed at his honest descriptions and then portrayals of his characters. Makes you believe these are true stories somehow. Very interesting and honest insight into how some people feel and think about events in their lives. Find myself able to laughingly relate. I enjoyed Cusack's character speaking to us throughout the film. I also enjoyed in Fever Pitch and About A Boy, how the main characters narrate their stories though not in the same way as High Fidelity."
3,Jack Black was the best thing about this movie,"Jack Black was the best thing about this movie. He made it funny at times when you needed some humor. I am normally a big John Cusack fan, but the storyline (about his past relationships) was just so depressing at some points in the movie."
2,Stopped,I got over half way finished watching this movie and it stopped and I could not resume the movie therefore I could'nt even watch the ending.
2,"I love John Cusack, but...","I have tried to watch this movie at least twice and can't make it through. I get about 75% there and realize the main character is a selfish jerk whom I don't sympathize with at all, and I'm also pretty bored.This is obviously a personal opinion, but as much as I love John Cusack as an actor, I did not like this movie."
2,"irritating ""zac morris"" style","irritating ""zac morris"" style only bearable (protagonist speaking directly to the camera) if you really like john cusack. The main problem is that he just comes across as irritating for most of the movie, and when he supposedly is ""coming around"" it just doesn't do much. He keeps saying all the wrong stuff to the women in his life, but since we don't care for him, there's no reason to pull for him either. This movie relies heavily on the characters and this falters from the start. The co-stars don't do all that much except for his love interest, laura, who serves her role fine. Lord knows how the record store is financed or much else.Overall, this is a movie that is not original and as it's supposed to be a ""soul searcher,"" it doesn't move you either.The only real amusement came when Darlene from Roseanne made a brief appearance and when the ""Boss"" made a cameo."
1,Gives Music Lovers a Bad Name,"There are two types of people: people who truly love music, and people who want other people to *know* that they truly love music. The shallow characters in ""High Fidelity"" consist of the second group of people.I saw this movie when it was originally released, and it was excruciating to sit through for the most part. Thinking about even trying to sit through it again is painful.We get it, Jack Black, you're obnoxious. Now go away.John Cusack is usually great in everything he does, but his character in ""High Fidelity"" is just a totally unlikeable and uninteresting person. The fact that he is unlikeable is established within the first few scenes - so that means you're stuck for an hour and a half watching someone who is unlikeable and not interesting. Sounds like a recipe for a good time, right?Skip this."
2,I really don't have much to say about this movie...,"...other than that I didn't like it much. Supposed to be a movie for the boys, about a frustrated music-lover that ""any guy can relate or identify himself to!"" -well, I didn't. The acting (John Cusack), he certainly is not the problem -he delievers with style what he has got to work with, but the story is a shallow mess! This guy whose girlfriend has broke up with him, and suddenly he starts to ask the main question in life -who is he? And as an idea to find out where he goes wrong time after time he asks all his past-girlfriends out on dates. This may sound hysterical-funny, but it's simply (in my opinion) so ""unbeliavable"" and too much! I couldn't relate to this ""losers'"" way of thinking or anything else in ""High Fidelity"". ""About a boy"" starring Hugh Grant (ever so different, but...) is a far better way of describe the ""modern"" man. This movie, I've seen it twice to see if it would change my opinion, is SO overrated!"
5,My All-Time Favorite Movie,"Strangely, when I bring up this movie, few say they have seen it. It is a comedy for the most part, but it retains its dignity as a drama, too, with beautifully portrayed details and dynamics about the journey of boy to man. I recommend this movie to my Developmental Psychology classes when we study later adolescence.Brilliantly placed and directed characters manage to support the central themes of the movie, which include ambivalence, and fears of intimacy and commitment; the war between the predatory and feverish nature of male sexuality and the need for a stable, nurturing relationship with one partner.There are bountiful moments of raw emotion, accurate reactions to dilemas we have all faced, and what is most gratifying is the depth of the characters and their stories. This is a beautiful movie that I never get tired of watching. If it doesn't bring at least a sniffle to your face, in addition to bawdy laughter, you are not human."
1,"useless, too many exceptions","4 year, 1 year, and 4 day cycles are used. Works great except when there is a missed point, or an inversion.Author recommends his Adam Theory Book. If Delta Phenonema ""pinpoints exact turning points"", why would the author advertise the Adam Theory Book??"
1,Kind of doesn't matter,"I think W.D Gann never reveal his methods while he was alive and sold his courses for 50K in todays dollars.This Jim guy sold it without making one dollar out of it.All I know is if its the holy grail, than a true legend must be behind it first.That is the way the cosmos work, so he sold the course for 35K and the guy that invented the RSI indicator claim it is Grail."
5,everyday living ware,These are everyday dishes that are pretty and very user friendly. My other dishes were heavy ironstone and now that I AM 50+ with arthritis I can't put them up onto the cupboard. I had these dishes 33 years ago and gave them away to get the fancy dishes. My mother still uses my 33 years old dishes. They are almost unbreakable and look much nicer than plastic or cheap dishes. CORRELLE is a dependable product that looks wonderful.
1,"""only for kids""","simply don't buy if have no kids around to use it. expected it to be white when i ordered as it appeared white on screen and they didn't mention otherwise.but to my disappointment it came in beige. don't like green color of mugs so can't give away as gift either,forget about using everyday.wish if i could return it !"
5,Much better then my shox!!,"I weigh 110 and 5' 7"" and my shox just didn't give me the response on court that these did. I found out later that the a3's were better for lighter weight players (under 190). I put alot of weight on the balls of my feet, the supersture has a full foot bed to give me protection and response. I play or pratice BB nearly everyday and these have held up better and didn't hurt my feet. I wore out my shox in less then 1 season and the balls of my feet hurt and I do not wear them off court. I jump around and move alot so my shoes have to be good. These are very good, better then shox mtx, ups, and lethal. I will be trying the a3 superstucture power2 next."
5,gift,bought for my graduates of OM....love it! I think the kids will love the game. I was very happy with the transaction and the gift was just like described
5,Spaceship provides multiple toys in one,"The Megablocks spaceship was given to my son at age 1 1/2 and he liked to take it apart and I put it back together until he could stack the pieces. He rediscovered it when he was 2 1/2, and flew both the ""big airplane"" and the small ""space ship"" around with the pilot. He also built many towers with the blocks and loved smashing the plane into them. At 3 yrs. and after he had seen the movie ToyStory, he was drawn to this toy again and now knows the names and quotes from BuzzLight year and the alien included. He still plays with it and all the blocks and he is almost 4. For any toy to entertain and last 3+ years, it deserves 5 stars."
5,great quality my 3 year old loves all the toys from this line,"I highly recommend all the toys from this line from Fisher Price. I bought everything form the line and couldn`t be more pleased. They are all high quality, extremely durable for 3+. Honestly they are the best quality figures I`ve ever bought for both of my children."
2,Beautiful watch if it would only work.,I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas. It is beautiful and he loves it. With the exception that it ran fine for about 6 weeks then died. I had the battery replaced and it started working but would stop at 5:00 pm everyday! Very frustrating!
5,Worth at least 3times the price,For a 300 thread count set it looks good and feels good and is standing up to normal wear and tear very well
4,Very cute book,"This is a nice book for girls with siblings. I thought it was focused on brothers and sisters but it also covers just sisters or twins. It is a nice book that goes through family issues, like fighting getting blamed for things your sibling does.It also talks about if your the oldest youngest or middle. The books makes some good points and I think it will help my daughter get along better with her little brother."
4,"On their way to peaceful coexistence, sort of!","My 9 year old daughter liked this book. She found it fun to read. She especially liked the sibling constitution that came in the book. She read it to her 7 year old brother then they both signed it, and now it is posted up on our fridge for all to see. This book didn't magically end all the arguing and fighting, but it's helped my daughter manage her frustrations and sometimes anger she feels from dealing with little brother."
5,A great CD. No regrets......,"Where to start..... I was completely blown away by this CD as soon as I put it into my stereo. Being used to the catchy, ""pop punk"" bands like Blink-182 and MxPx, this CD pointed me into the true punk direction. With awesome guitar hooks, great vocals, and meaningful lyrics, End Is Forever will keep you listening for weeks. There's deep love songs like ""IOU one galaxy"" and ""Fast times at drop out high"" and classic lyrically ""stupid"" punk songs like ""Song for a mix tape"". A great CD, buy it and you wont regret it."
5,Hi my name isnt slim shady,"Well all I can say about this CD, is a fantastic job on producing it. It is a very catchy CD with songs that pretty much everyone can relate to. The CD is very singalongable and the lyrics just go with every song. My personal favorites are giving up on love, and you need a hug. The Ataris put their best CD together where everyperson can enjoy it. Even people that dont even like punk rock who listen to stuff like Jay-Z and Dr.Dre, I gave them a listen to the CD and they thought it was pretty good. When some of the people I live with in my college dorm who are all about hip hop and R&B say they like the CD, thats when you know its respectable. If you havent ever heard of the Ataris, buy the CD anyway, everyone likes this stuff."
1,Worst Punk rock album ever.,"this would be an excellent purchase if you enjoy the always changing and exciting world of punk rock. However, i dont i saw the music video boys of summer and thought that maybe this would be a good purchase. IT WASNT. The songs are all very repetitive and lame, the riffing is the same the whole way through and i dont think that the band members can eve play their instruments right."
4,Relaxing and stylish,"This single have many mixes of the ""Farewell to the moon."" My favorite mix would be the club mix edit. Much of the style is very similar to ATB's new album ATB - Two Worlds (A 2 CD set). So if you like this type of style you might want to look into that album. This single to me is very soothing and relaxing. So if you're in a mood to relax it's a great track but if you're up for something more upbeat I'd pass."
4,great,Someone said that too many levels are repeated. Why would they say that? Of course levels were repeated; it is a remake of the original game.
4,Prepare to work those thumbs!,"Reviewed for Big Boss Games by: TRCI sum up this game as ""Thumb Exercise 101"".In Metroid Zero Mission for the GBA you play as Samus going on a mission to destroy Mother Brain and all the Metroids.Metroid Zero Mission is a great remake of the original Metroid from the NES.This game has lots of cool stuff added, like a whole other level after you defeat Mother Brain.This game is very addictive. My poor thumbs hurt and I still kept on playing till the very end. (6+ hours later)The sound for this game was good, 8/10.Graphics were greatly enhanced from the original game, 8/10.Gameplay was fun and enjoyable. I only wish it was longer, 7/10.Overall, this game gets a ?my poor thumbs? 8/10."
4,Has it been that long?,"Its been a long way since the original metroid in 1986. 18 years in fact. This is the finest to hit the game boy series and also the newest. This game has its ups and down. This is more of a quick play action game. The game is short, but you have to admire everything else also. The galleries, the original metroid game already put in and the well located controls. This is a game for the books."
4,Good... but too short.,"(...)The game is really only mabye three to three and-a-half hours for the average gamer (I'm ten and I beat it in four hours), and then you access the NES Metroid. Suprisingly, it's way harder!This leads me to my next point. Nintendo has geared the difficulty so low a six-year-old could probably whip through it.Not to say it's bad, for the graphics are splendid (you can even see the gravity suit glowing), the music is full of eerie remixes of the original game, and the controls make you suddenly feel every other game you have feels slow and clunky.Make it longer (and a little harder) and the game would reach the level of perfection.As is, it's a solid, A- kind of game."
3,This brass buckle needs polishing,"I have read all of Robinson's books in the correct order and they have kept me interested and focused on the subject.This last one though is not up to it.The plot is paper thin, the characters almost mickey mouse, a double serving of US self righteousnes, all other countries are treated as new recruits in the barracks and last but for me not least Robinson's syntactic is deteriorating rapidly.""And then"" is one of the ands repeated mostly in this novel to such a degree that if he were a student and I a teacher, I would give him a D.Give me ""Kilo class"" any time but if I had to read ""the Shark Mutiny"" one more time i'd become a mutineer also."
3,3 stars at best...,"The shark mutiny has a decent plot, however, it gets to be a bit technical in the way of military lingo. When the Chinese mine the strait of Hormuz and several Oil carriers explode, a young Navy rookie finds himself in an intense situation in the middle east. The story gets to be a bit suspenseful when the navy SEALS head out in a submarine on a mission.The plot is missing something. More character building perhaps?No more than 3 stars...save your money check it out of the library if you'd like to read this one..."
4,Slight disappointment,"well I was pleased at the speed in which I received it I was disappointed that the product did not match the picture shown on web site, it wasn't until I read the box that I saw ""item may vary from photo"" the web picture showed a strap just like the OEM one cap on the car which I like because I'm less likely to loose but this locking cap as no strap which while not affercting it's use was not exactly what I was expecting."
5,Stant Gas Cap Review,"Fits exactly to my car. With todays gas prices, it gives me piece of mind from people who steals gas from cars."
1,Will not make mounting slides any easier,"I got this tool to help mount about a dozen 20"" drawer slides in my kitchen cabinets. After trying to mount a few slides using this tool, it quickly became apparent that this tool is a complete waste of money. I can't say that it makes mounting drawer slides into existing cabinets any easier, in fact, I think it slowed me down by trying to get the tool clamped in place and then not bumping it and then trying to drill pilot holes or mount screws... it just does not workYou are better off just cutting some scrap pieces of wood as spacers and resting the slides on them.....Quick, repeatable and cheap. I had high hopes for this, but its a complete fail as a useful tool IMHO."
4,The Third Hand You Always Need,"Worked well with the bottom mount slides on a 20 drawer face frame built-in. Did need a little tweaking with the rear alignment, but that was because of my design. Magnets are strong and hold well. Did not get the Kreg clamp, almost any small clamp (C-clamp, quick grip, etc.) in your shop should work. Would recommend."
5,Cabinet drawer,My husband is building cabinets for my kitchen and purchased the magnetic drawer slide tool to mount the drawer rollers. He is glad he did. !!!! The mounting took probably five minutes to install both rollers. He also purchased the rails to set the drawer on while he secured the rollers to the drawers. These two items are a breeze to use and sets the drawer perfectly in the center of the cabinet. This is a must if you want perfection for your cabinets.!! Extremely pleased. !!!!!!!
2,Unfortunately it's just too generic and non-involving.,"I was hoping for more given who Simon's father is, but it seems he's gone down the same cheese-filled road that Phil did eventually. I thought that maybe we'd get to experience some of the innovation and originality that Phil had early in his career with early Genesis and his first couple of solo albums, but Simon gives us something that's OK to play in the background yet doesn't hold up to real listening, in my opinion. I'm not intentionally slagging the guy -- it's very apparent that he has talent, but he just doesn't quite have the creative songwriting tools to make it jump out yet."
4,Great actors,"This is a very instense and funny movie, my family and I really enjoyed it, is a movie we will see again for sure with friends."
2,A real let-down,"Thurbon's book got me very excited when I found it in the bookstore (sorry Amazon) as I had recently decided that I needed to know much more about the region than I did. After reading it, I have to say that Thurbon's book seems to follow a predictable pattern - Thurbon has his main point, which is that Siberia is a rotten place, and he finds locals to prove his point over and over again in a depressing manner. It doesn't seem to do justice to the region, nor is it very informative."
5,Remodelers friend,"If you are remodeling and you have a need to pull nails this is the tool for you. For example, remove subfloor with out destroying the subfloor, pull the nails, remove the subfloor intact, and when done can reinstall by renailing."
5,Nail Puller,I was loaned a tool just like this one. I had a special application that it worked better on than any other nail pulling tool that I had so I purchased a new one. I found this one on Amazon. I could not find it anywhere else. Worked very well and I am pleased with the purchase.
5,Great puller!,"Once you get the hang of this puller, it's quick and easy! Does take some wood out but that can't be avoided. And Amazon has the best price for this tool..."
1,Cooper Nail Puller,"I am very sorry I purchased this unit. It is probably the worst nail puller you could find anywhere. It doesn't work very well or not at all. The grasping part of the tool should have some kind of split to get under the head and it doesn't. It is awkward and hard to use and no instructions or tips came with the unit. The old flat pry bar type nail puller is 100 times more effective than this puller. So I wasted my money. If I had known what the grasping part of the tool looked like, I would never have bought it."
4,Would be perfect if mugs were also Correlle,"I really like this pattern. It is friendly and cheery and gives me a lift every time I pull the plates out to eat. The cups were my reason for 4 stars instead of 5 -- they are stoneware, which I knew when I ordered, and made in China. I like that the plates and bowls are made in America and that I KNOW they are not leaching lead or other materials from dyes into my food. Stuff from China -- who knows? So the cups will stay in the cupboard, but yes, I highly recommend this set."
4,sad and joyous and beautiful,"I checked this book out from the library and returned it before finishing it because I thought it was repetitive and tedious, albeit beautifully written. I returned to the library for the book two weeks later because I couldn't get the characters and prose out of my mind. Scenes and narratives from this book will stay with me for years to come. I've copied passages down that took my breath away with their beauty so that I can read them over again. A life-affirming, haunting work that will have a lasting and tremendous impact on my worldview. A book unlike any other I have read."
2,Never have so many words said so little,"Like one or two other reviewers here, I got more than half of the way through this book but eventually had to chuck it aside in frustration. I *wanted* to like it so much, but its plot (even using the word ""plot"" is being rather generous) is so circular, monotonous, and repetitive, that I just didn't feel I was getting anywhere. A very frustrating reading process. I pressed on for a long time, hoping the book was actually going somewhere -- and maybe it would have done had I persisted, but it's hard to imagine how or when or that it could have been worth the effort. So, even though some of Okri's language and imagery was remarkable, it just wasn't worth enduring the other 95% of the book. Maddening!"
4,A re-introduction to African literature,"I read The Famished Road because a Nigerian won a Booker Prize, never heard of Ben Okri before then. It reminded me of the quality of African literature and showed what I must have missed reading Wole Soyinka's works as a teenager. The narrative is so intense and the result is a beautiful combination of English literary writing and African history and tradition. This book re-awakened my love for literature. I have also read Songs of Enchantment and am halfway through Dangerous Love, which I think is the best I've read."
2,Disapointing,"For those of us who don't have time to read everything (ie. everyone) it is tempting to rely on awawrds and honors to point us in the right direction. Once again the ""literary"" folk who dole out prizes point us towards an artful book with little substance. I found this book to be long and tedious with no redeeming qualities. Surely there are better book on Africa and its rich character(s) and sensibilities."
3,"Mediocre product, I've used better","These t-shirts are okay, but nothing special. The material is somewhat thin, which was a big disappointment to me. Nowhere near the thick cotton material I was hoping for. The size is also a little bit smaller than expected for a XXL. It's getting harder to find shirts with really top-notch quality."
3,I was expecting so much more...,I was really wanting this to be so much more than it turned out to be. I am extremely pro-life and have had a miscarriage. I was hoping to feel some comfort or at least be an outlet for some healthy grieving. Although I feel this book had a few decent ideas I didn't feel a connection to this book at all. It was a little confusing at times and didn't really feel a connection with the characters.
5,TILLY,"ONE OF THE BEST STORIES I HAVE EVER HEARD, THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT WAS ON THE RADIO THEN I READ THE BOOK, IT IS A GREAT TOOL FOR ANYONE WHO HAS HAD A ABORTION OR LOST A CHILD, GOD GIVES US HOPE ..PASTOR BRENDA"
5,"""more mature readers""??? I don't think so!","Just a quick note... I read this book when I was a teen, and my 11-year old daughter just finished reading it, and loved it, I might add... I think if more teenage girls read this, it just might persuade them to not make a horrible decision by killing their unborn baby. Just my thoughts..."
3,"Tilly, a Novella","I expected this book to move me. I was disappointed. The story is, of course, moving, but it is underdone. I could not, truly, empathize with any character. I was not given a chance. I love Peretti's novels. He is an amazing writer, and I know this story could be so much more in his capable hands. It needed developing. We never know why this woman aborted her 4th child. We know almost nothing of the story. It's a quick easy read, and it could bring healing to a wounded spirit. But, as far as being just a reader, I would suggest Atonement Child by Francine Rivers."
3,Weller 8200px Soldering Gun Kit,Basically a great product The main heating tip bent rather easily. Tip should be built heavier
3,Food good but timely,My friend Jackie told me about this book. It calls for a lot of ingredients which is kind of a pain but the food is good (and high in sodium).
5,A Must Have for any Serious Writings!,"This is the most beautiful book I have ever owned! I love to write whether it is journaling or playing around with Poetry or Short Stories...I am so inspired just by the book itself! It is a magical book to hold and look at! I'm serious! I first was sceptical to purchase it because it is pricy for a blank sketch or writing book, but it is worth every cent! I will be purchasing more books to create a collection of Poetry and Stories that I feel my family will be able to treasure because of this truely Beautiful Book! I love the magnetic closure strap also! The book has the appearance of an antique treasure book. It is a great keepsake for journals or diarys."
3,Not her best,"I'm a big Grafton fan and have faithfully read every one in this series, but maybe it's time for a change. The money laundering scheme could have been interesting, but it just didn't ignite. The characters also weren't enough to keep my interest rivited for the entire novel. I actually found myself skimming the last part of the book just to finish it."
3,Big Disappointment!,"After waiting two years for this book to be published, I really expected more. Kinsey has become a different person from the sharp, independent lady that we have come to know, in her previous outings. This time, she allowed a paroled felon to call all the shots.... usually going against her better judgement. Reba is an out of control birdbrain, but Kinsey never challenges her...she just does whatever Reba decides. I am sure that I will buy the ""S"" book....I will just not be as impatient, for its release, as I had been for this one."
1,Dull plot. Novel is littered with useless and irrelevant fillers,"The plot, if one can even call it as such, is dull. Some episodes are so impropable that their only reason of existence is to glue together a flimsily constructed story. If you still intend to read the book, I might suggest that you read just the first and the last chapters. You will still have read the same story, and saved yourself a bit of time and grief."
3,Not Her Best,"I've read all the Kinsey Millhone books from A to S. ""R"" is probably my least favorite. I was happy that Kinsey finally got some decent clothes and a haircut. I also liked hearing more about Henry and his brothers.I agree with another reader who wondered how Kinsey could know so much about the clothes and fabrics that others are wearing when she doesn't know much beyond jeans and a turtleneck for herself. She also seems to know a lot about interior design and furniture that her background doesn't explain. I've been wondering those things for awhile--not just while reading this book.If you are new to Sue Grafton and Kinsey Millhone, don't start with this book. You probably won't like it. Most series are better if read in order. Start with ""A"" and go on in order. At least, with this series, it's not hard to figure out where to start!"
2,Sue Grafton can do much better!,"I love all the Kinsey Milhone novels. I can't wait until the next one comes out. This one, however, didn't seem to be about Kinsey at all. It was pretty boring and I didn't feel the same ""at home"" feeling I usually get from her novels. I will read them all, but this one was my least favorite."
3,More on McDonald's,"What is even more suspicious about the McDonald's/Grafton connection is that she never ever says anything even slightly negative about McDonalds. Even people who love McDonald's have some reservations about the place, the decor, the selection -- something. Personally, my quip is that McDonald's are amazingly similar the world over, even in Moscow, where I lived for a few years. Every time I leave a McDonald's I feel almost the same degree of nausea... (I'm just going thru R is for Ricochet for the second time, to give it another chance. It is still not her best, though it is interesting for me to contrast how different it was to experience it deep in the Moscow winter to now, in sunny southern California.)"
3,I do niot wish to reiiew boojs,I wikl not review any more books and if that means I have to quit buying from you so be it
2,too slow,"This is the first book I've read in the Kinsey Millhone series. I have to say that after this, I have no intention of reading another one. The plot develops so slow, and the characters are not so likable. Most annoying, as some others have already pointed out, is that the author would describe things that are completely not helpful to move the story along in minute details. Who cares about how you closed the car door!"
4,Picking up again...,"I have always anticipated the latest installment of Kinsey Millhone's antics; although the previous 2 were not as exciting to me. ""R"" is right back on track with the action and fun plot lines; from her personal life (finally a love interest which I hope Grafton will cultivate!), her landlord's kooky family, and on top of that a fun mystery to solve! I can hardly wait for ""S"" in December!"
2,The picture is wrong.,"The bag I received was much smaller, seems other reviewers had the same problem, so I think its safe to assume the picture is inaccurate. Its a good bag none the less so its not fair to give it a one star..."
5,Abduction Club - Period Drama DVD,"A very delightful look into the love stories of young men born as second sons, who would never inherit the family estate. Reared as gentleman with no fortune, they must embrace either the priesthood or an heiress. A group calling themselves The Abduction Club decided that abducting an heiress for each member, in hopes to win her favor, was their aim in life. The camaraderie of the gentlemen and the problems they encounter is a comical look back into the true events of the times."
4,The Orisa leaves and plants,"Well, I bought this book and I considered it very good. it divided in two parts, the first is about ""ewe orisa"" in Yoruba and the second is about brasilian leaves and plants. The writter put in all observation made in the houses that has pratic experience in the subject, in the some cities like Salvador, Recife and Rio de Janeiro, this cities received slaves so much when the Brazil has descovery. I recomend this book for the people that need understand like useful this knowledge in his lives and in his houses for religius pratic. Good Read!"
1,Not his best work.,"If you really want to enjoy adam green's style and band, you should purchase another cd like GEMSTONES. This cd, is totally different than anything else adam green has ever done. These songs are slow, and not as fun as any of his older work. Even with the moldy peaches, adam was full of fun and lyrics that would drive your brain wild. Adam is a cool guy, no doubt, but this cd just rubbed me the wrong way totally. His other work is so, so, so much better! I've seen Adam live and he does put on a good show, and his band is the coolest."
2,I wanted...,"Something safer on my teeth than steel, but wanted the look of steel in my mouth.. So the picture of this barbell is VERY inaccurate. I was expecting very condensed glitter for a completely silver look.. The silver is very much spaced out and awkward looking.. Clear beads with very little glitter..The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the acrylic flexible nature IS comfortable."
2,"HOT,HOT,HOT",I LIKE THE STYLE OF THE COFFEE POT BUT I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS THE COFFEE IS NOT HOT ENOUGH I HAVE TO PUT IN MICRO
1,Leaky,"I was not impressed with this coffee maker either, in fact I'm returning it. Sometimes half the coffee goes in the carafe, and the other half leaks all over the counter and gets inside the machine.It is also difficult to pour coffee out of the carafe without removing the lid."
2,Also disappointed...,"I was intially drawn to this coffee maker due to it's looks. In my opinion looks is about the only thing going for it. I found the coffee maker cumbersome to use in both filling the coffee maker and pouring the coffee. In filling the coffee maker the design of the top lid seems to increase spillage of the water when filling. The carafe pours slowly, you almost need to take the top of the carafe off to pour a cup of coffee. There is an led clock disaplay that is virtually useless since it is almost impossible to see. Another peeve is that the coffee maker shuts off right after it brews so the only thing keeping the coffee warm is the carafe itself. I also had some 'spillage' problems as indicated by another reviewer. I'm not sure what caused this."
4,"Nice printer, good scanner","I've been using this printer for about 6 months, and I've had very little problem with it. I use it mostly to print documents and greeting cards. It is not photo quality, so I don't attempt to print photos. For the type of printing I do, it's been great. I love the fact that it scans, photocopies and prints. I haven't tried to use it's faxing ability because it's not near a phone jack.I only give it 4 stars because the replacement ink cartridges are so expensive."
3,aerobic stepper,I was very satisfied with the short amount of time it took to get my product and it was in great condition. The only reason for the 3 stars is because it was to small for me as I was looking for a club sized stepper. However they were great and made a return easy and painless! Definetly would recommend the seller!
1,Provoking nature only to kill it?,"That is bear territory. If we go there we are jeprodizing ourselves and the bears. Nobody wins. No one doubts that bears will (eventually) try to eat humans if given the chance. If you do go bring bear spray or something. If you kill a bear, even in self defense, you should be severly penalized (huge fines/jail time). YOU are the idiot who went to bear country. It's like sticking your hand in a bee's nest. Dugh! So do the bears a favor, don't temp/provoke them only to kill them with your gun! This is bordering animal cruelty. By the way - being there IS provoking them."
1,Quincy,"The book disturbed me greatly when I read it. I'm so fed up with elitists who despise their own species and go and glorify wild animals. The author was so happy when his favorite bear ""Quincy"" showed up on his last day on earth that he laughed and congratulated himself during his last phone call. It's a terrible thought, but I rather think Quincy ate him and his girlfriend. I wonder what he thought of Quincy before he died."
1,edjit,suicide-30 bucks (pills)suicide by cop-300 bucks (bullets)suicide by bear-priceless (book goes best seller )
4,love corelle,"FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE THE CORELLE COLLECTION. I HAVE TWO BOYS WHO ARE 19 AND 20 AND EAT ALL DAY AND NIGHT. IT'S NICE KNOWING THAT I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CHIPPING PLATES AND BOWLS. I JUST WISH THAT THE MUGS WERE ALSO CHIP RESISTANT. THE PATTERN IS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. IT'S VERY HARD TO FIND THAT COLOR WHICH IS A DEEP BURGANDY WITH A SLIGHTLY OFF-WHITE BASE. IT'S VERY RICH LOOKING YET CAN BE USED EVERYDAY. ALSO, THE PRICE WAS REASONABLE. I LOVE IT."
2,NOT by the original artists,"I may be naive, but this CD is NOT by the original artists, so if you were looking for the ""right sound"", this is one to skip. If, however, you just want to ""get close"" and enjoy the almost sound, it is a pretty close replication of most songs. I actually could understand the words to ""Tubthumping"" for the first time!"
1,Weak handle,"I Brought this on a camping trip new, and was using it for kindling; when on the first day, with a hard stroke into the wood, the handle snapped. Im very disappointed with the quality of this axe considering Buck makes such good knives. I will be asking amazon for a refund/exchange (maybe I just got a faulty one."
4,paul mccartney book,the book was exactly in the condition the seller descibed and it arrived very promptly highly recommended the seller!!
3,"great look, needs more recipes",It's a beautiful book with lush pictures. The Details section at the back is very helpful. My only problem is that she didn't give recipes for all the dishes that she mentions. It would have been nice to complete the ensemble with a complete menu.
2,Shakespeare for very beginning beginners,"I guess I expected this to be a little more intellectual than it was. Really written on a low high school level, with that type of vocabulary, sometimes vulgar."
5,Cullman Quick Release Plates,Excellent product and merchant! Product arrive quickly via USPS and fit my tripod perfectly. Would definitely recommend buying from merchant.
3,It as ok,"The original plastic it was wrapped in had holes in it like someone poked it. It made me a little nervous about the quality of the game. But after I checked it, it was good. Maybe next time choose a better quality."
3,Mixed feelings,"I really like this pillow and the support it provides for my neck. But, I have only been using it for about a month now and it is already losing its firmness at the narrow front part that supports the neck. I cannot tell if that is because the pillow is not as promised to maintain its firmness or if it is because of the way it was shipped. It came in an envelope with no cardboard support or protection. It seemed a little flattened when I received it as if something heavy had been placed on it. Or it was under heavy boxes during shipping. A bit disappointed."
5,Title says it all!,"The title of this book matches its content perfectly. I read it years ago and am glad to see it re-printed for today's fan to read. So many NASCAR books today are nothing but fluff - rehashes of generally known stories about Gordon, Stewart, and Earnhardt. But this book is much more. Learn about the great characters and events of the 60s - Curtis Turner, Joe Weatherly, Fred Lorenzen, Linda ""Miss Hurst Shifter"" Vaughn, the annual celebration of the Southern 500 in Darlington (a tradition now gone), and of course The King RICHARD PETTY. Whether you are a new or long-time Cup fan, get this book today."
4,An entertaining read...,"Definitely different from her other series, but an enticing tale of brother and sister mystery solvers in a different day and age. I liked it a lot and am impatiently waiting for the next one to come out."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I had waited and waited for so, so long for a story on Nicky and was really disappointed to find his story in this collection. Throughout most of her historical romance bestsellers, he was the champion for her heroines and deserve much better. I had expected him to have his own book. I am not sure why Ms. McNaught decided to cut his story short, but I am sure that I am speaking for all her fans out there, that she should consider publishing a full story on Nicky."
2,One of the worst of Nick Nolte's movies.,"I like Nick Nolte. The only reason why I saw this movie is because of him. However, I have to say that this is the worst acting I have ever seen from his any other movies. Very often, it was awkard and unnatural. Another problem is other supporting actresses and actors. They don't act like real. They acted like they were just out from acting school. The whole plot is not really well coordinated (I won't say anything about it, since it is going to be a spoiler). The movie was boring to watch. If there is a reason why I hung on till the end, it was just to see how it ended (and the thought that I paid money for this movie). As a plus, you can somehow get some slightest idea of what is going on behind making movies (selection of actors/acresses/kids). There a few nice phrases which come out of Nolte. If you are a big Nolte fan, and want to see above plus things, you may want to see this movie. Otherwise, this movie is boring big time."
1,Lame,"A lot of the ideas REPEAT THEMSELVES. For example, one might say serve your partner breakfast in bed. Then a couple pages later it will say, serve heart shaped pancakes to your partner in bed. Then a couple more pages and it says, serve your partner cookies and milk in bed. Jeez. And its a lot of obvious stuff like, bring home flowers. Gee thanks for that suggestion Dr. Love. Not recommended."
5,Incas 101 textbook,This is the place to go for the beginner to find out about the daily life of the Incas before the conquistadores came along and loused everything up. It is curious that so advanced a civilization never invented writing or the wheel.
4,Good,"This book helped in what I was looking for. In conjunction with another white mountain book and maps this served its purpose. I thought it is a good reference to narrow down the areas of interest. I would recommend this book. I think they could have added alot more hikes to the book, but then it wouldn't be the Best Loop Hikes i guess."
5,Amazing and Simple,"There's, as the other reviews have said, not much on the plot-side of this story which is oh-so-unique, but the corny and cliche antics of these two step brothers is nothing to miss. Very many moments in this story will spark an actual ""lol"", and some of the twists are absolutely insane, yet still worthy of that laugh.This book is highly entertaining, and very fun to get into! Only worry, is this is considered incest, even though it's step siblings, so those who are uncomfortable with it should steer clear. Also, this is an --explicit-- yaoi, so those who aren't really into this thing should also not get this book. There are very many sex-based pages, and censoring is near unheard of in this. xD"
4,"I Liked It, But...","When I first started to read this, opening the cover and glimpsing the first page, I was very exited. The colored image of the two boys is beautiful, simply beautiful, and portrays a good relationship- something I always like to see. But I do have to say I was a little put off, at first, because I'm not used to scenes like that. If some yaoi is cencored, this one is the opposite extreme. However, there *is* a story, and I do like the cute faces the characters can make. And upon reading it the second and thrid time, I really did enjoy it. I understood what was happening, what was happening next, WHY it was happening, so it made what once put me off understandable. So I gave it a four star rating because it's worth the read even if it isn't the best yaoi I've ever read."
3,Secrets of the morning,"I loved the first book, but this one got me so mad. I hated the way her mother was and grandmother. I was so sick of them repeating the same things over and over and the book and toward the end I skimmed the pages I read and jumped paragraghs, But, I had to read it in order to go on to the third book. I also hated the character Michael in this book and she really should of not added him. Dawn was stupid for getting involved with him and I wish she'd not had the baby for him. She should of with Jimmy! ooooooooooo I hated this book book toward the middle and end because it wasnt well written."
1,Molly and Lawless John,"If I were Sam Elliott, I would have this one pulled and destroyed. This is the worst movie I have ever watched. It has been re-mastered or something. The acting is terrible as is the production.I would have gotten more entertainment out of throwing the money in the street and watching people scramble for it.Sam Elliott is one of my favorite actors, but this doesn't represent him properly.I would return it, however the shipping would be more than the DVD is worth."
3,Molly and Lawless John,"It's a good old ""B"" western with Sam Elliot as the bad guy.Very good for all Sam Elliot fans and Good for all cowboy movie fans."
1,Yuck!,"This must be one of Sam Elliot's first movies. It is very poor and I do not recommend it. It is not appropriate for young viewers. Sam Elliot had not yet developed his appealing true-cowboy persona in this film and those who are looking for another ""Conagher"" will be disappointed. My opinion--don't waste your money."
4,Sam Elliot Movie,Pretty old movie and the quality of the filming is not very good but I brought it for my Dad and he does like it.
4,"Small, Slim, and Works","Good feel and small footprint. This the first keyboard that I have used where the multi-media hot keys actually work. As does the stand-by hot key.Overall it is a nice looking keyboard, but the chrome strip is a bit much and textured finish on the keys was not uniform when new. A few months of use has helped homogenized the surface appearance though. However, there is still some noticeable flow marks on the body of the keyboard, but rather subtle. OK, I am nit-picking, this is a great keyboard at a great price.I am tempted to give this a five star rating, but the small blemishes hold it back, but only by half a star, so think of this as a four and a half star product.If you are curious, this is running connected to a MacBook running XP. No problems with installation."
4,Good slim keyboard,"The keyboard is sturdy, and is great for those wanting a slim/laptop style keyboard. Short stroke, relatively quiet, no noticable keyboard flexing. Multimedia keys work fine. I subtracted one star because of the non-standard insert key location. This might not be a concern for most but if you are programming in terminal shift+insert = paste. Just gotta get used to the new location."
3,mac compatible with pc buttons,"Keyboard works fine, keys feel fine. I bought this because it has a usb plug to work with my apple laptop, but find the windows-oriented key markings disorienting. I didn't realize it at the time, and chose this over the mac-coordinated white model because it was a few dollars cheaper."
5,Kensington Slim Keyboard,"I really like this keyboard. It has scissor action keys that have increased my speed. The keys are spaced perfect, and extremely responsive. It takes up very little desk space. I look forward to many years use from it, and I will purchase another one when I wear this one out."
4,"great laptop feel, sometimes hit ALT too often","Great keyboard if you are looking for that precise laptop feel. Takes some getting used to since all the keys are close together and some keys take some getting used to like me hitting ""alt"" too often.Product great, but $8 shipping sucks, especially since they take forever just for USPS to pick it up from their office. Took me 10+ days to receive it. Can you believe it?"
2,Broke after 4 weeks of use,"The keyboard felt quite nice, worked fine, although it looked a little flimsy. Sure enough, after four weeks or so I booted the computer up one morning to get a BIOS error saying ""Keyboard not recognized"". It no longer works at all.Now trying to get a replacement somehow."
5,great for Macs too,"This is a nice keyboard, with a good feel. The compactness is great. Works well with Macs too. Even though there is a white Mac version I prefer the darker keyboard and was glad that the function keys work, such as the volume up/down and the sleep button. F12 works for CD tray open close too. Overall a great value."
3,Watch out for repetitive stress injuries,"I like the scissor action of this keyboard. It looks nice and seems very sturdy. The only downside that I did not consider before purchase is that with such a small keyboard your hands have to be close together while typing which puts my wrists at a bad angle. I type continuously for 4 hours a day and at the end of that I am really starting to feel the discomfort. I find myself sliding the keyboard over to one side or the other to relieve the stress, but there is no happy medium."
4,Very Good Family and Consumer Sciences Textbook,My students could easily understand and enjoyed using this textbook. The publishers issue new editions often enough to keep the pictures from becoming out-dated. I think it is a very good textbook.
1,Do not buy this item,"This scanner is no longer listed on Targus' website. The copyright on the package that I received is dated 2002. The instructions for installing the software say to ""Ignore the message that this driver is not certified by Microsoft."""
1,Choose a different travel system,"I hate this travel system. Contrary to the hefty price tag, it is NOT well built or designed. It's very cheap and it's not cushy or comfy for the baby. The canopy on the carseat pulls off easily, the tray on the stroller gets scratched up because of the way it collapes, and it's not easy to use at all. I'm tired of fighting with this thing (it's only 4 months old)...I'm getting rid of it and purchasing a Graco or Evenflo."
1,This is not the Sia I love,"I love Sia. I have just about every one of her songs, and love all her videos on YouTube. But this DVD sorely disappointed me. Compared to every other live performance of hers that I've seen, these have very little energy, virtually no real interaction with the audience, and her voice is strained and weak compared to the power and emotion she usually shows. This is a waste of money."
4,Solid reporting on a scary subject,"Although its content scared me silly, I enjoyed this book. Kaplan is a skilled reporter who exhaustively probes the pervasive influence of the religious right on the Bush Administration. (And I have to take exception to an earlier, negative review posted here. You would think that someone who supposedly earned a Ph.D. from Harvard would know how to spell ""dichotomy"" and ""mantra."")"
3,interesting Adaptation of Junji Ito's Manga Flawed by Low Budget,"Marred by low budget and inferior production value, this film is more interesting than more JHorror products. Long dreams often seem like they only last a few seconds in waking life, and this movie shows what happens when one is caught up in dreams of increasing magnitude until one's humanity is lost. Beyond the poor SFX and pedestrian acting are some interesting ideas. Junji Ito's original manga story, though brief, is well worth seeking out as well."
2,slightly better than scifi tv movies,"Mildly fun although dissappointing to see all the cliche mystics (Native American, Mayan, etc.) and government agents as the adversary. Jewel is nice to look and if its a real slow evening it would pass the time and you wouldn't have to worry about any lingering thoughts or visions from the movie."
2,blah,Blah blah blah this movie started out OK but was so boring I could not get through a quarter of it
1,Not Great,"Stories were rather boring, though I learned a bit more about gypsies.Would not recommend."
5,This saved my child's dignity.,"There is so much horror in divorce. It's bad enough from the adults' perspective, but as a child who is catching only bits and pieces of a larger picture, it can pull the rug out from under her feet. My six-year-old daughter clung to this book for weeks, reading and absorbing the honest information on the pages. She learned how to take care of herself emotionally, how not to get pulled into a needy parent's net, how to answer questions about her parents' divorce and how to accept her new circumstances and move on with grace and dignity. Now, a few years later, we still bring it out to deal with new issues and remember how to handle old ones."
5,Tea Tree Oil has many uses and is wonderful!!,Tea Tree Oil has many uses and is wonderful and Thursday Plantation is the right brand. If I ever get a Fire Ant bite I always use this on the bite. Tea Tree Oil will keep it from getting infected and scaring. It has many uses.
1,DO NOT flush these wipes,"My tenant used ""flushable"" wipes and clogged my sewer line. Her toilet backed up and flooded the bathroom. It cost me a lot of money to get the line cleared.Sure, they'll flush, but they can cause expensive problems."
1,Not designed for odor removal,"The BioGS only has at most a 1.5 pound carbon ""sheet"". It failed to remove flowery/sweet scents from the air. I have been unable to sleep due to these odors and this unit didn't even put a dent in the quality of the air.I ran it for approx 10 days with no change in air quality. I'll be replacing it with an AllerAir Tube VOCARB for a compatible cost. The AllerAir has a 7-pound VOCARB carbon filter that will remove the odor from the air and filter it with its comparable HEPA filter/pre-filters.I really thought this unit would work based on the reviews here. However, I'm an engineer and do my own testing. It simply didn't clean the air. This BioGS has a fancy smell sensor, which spent the entire time in operation indicating 3-4 bars of smell in the room. The partial sensor had one bar, indicating the room had more gasses/smells/VOCs than partials.If you want to remove partials, get this, if you want to remove partials and odor get something else."
4,so far so good,Not sure how it compares to other products as we have not tired them but just having it we feel like maybe there is cleaner air.. we also at the same time got our ducts cleaned and carpets shampooed so maybe the whole house is just in better shape.. it is a bit larger then we would like.. the sharper image ones seem like a good size but i think this one is more effective.customer service and the company itself is amazing and respond very quickly and positively to any of our requests. that make a big difference to us.
2,This produdt is highly hyped...,"I bought this product by the overwhelming positive reviews. I hope these are honest reviews or my shipment does not function as well as those reviewers'. To me, this thing is a piece of good looking and quiet appliance, nothing more than that. I have had it for several weeks now and I opened to see the filters and they are still clean. I can't imagine how such a thing would clean air."
1,junk,"Do not buy this product. My husband and I bought this going off what others reviews read. We dont feel that the odor sensor worked at all, nor did it clean the air. We kept it for two weeks thinking that it just needed more time to clean the air. Didnt work. The odor still stayed in the house, and it did no more than suck air in and blow the same air back out through the top. Very expensive to purchase, very expensive to return. Very dissappointed. Returned to company, and then purchased an Oreck. Couldn't be happier with our Oreck purchase."
3,"Wondering what""s the truth","This film covers Chinese Catholicism extensively. It goes through every aspect of Catholicism as we know it in the west minus the 7 sacraments. It also covers the charity works done by their nuns. But as was told about the Catholic church in China, it makes m wonder if this is not a propaganda film. The film is short and in Chinese with English subtitles. It's about an hour or so long. I wish it contained interviews with the lay Catholics and had their opinions included. That is what makes me feel like it is a propaganda film. Only the best of Catholicism in China is shown and no interviews with the lay people."
3,Contact Sountrack,This soundtrack brings back the memories of watching the movie in real time. I like the fact that it is all music and no voices. However I was expecting more of the main theme to be interspersed throughout the soundtrack
5,"Beautiful music; powerful, insightful, wonderous.","I love the movie ""Contact."" It almost perfectly reproduced the feelings of the book by Carl Sagan, and was overall a wonderful production. But I found that one of the best parts of the movie was the music! Alan Silvestri did an excellent job capturing the same feelings of mystery and wonderment and humility that the movie expressed perfectly. And he also perfectly complimented the exciting and almost scary parts of the movie (""Good to Go""). Essentially, he joined every scene in the film with just the right music. Beautiful music, exciting music, powerful music. Absolutely wonderful. Not ""just good"" as some have said, but absolutely wonderful. This is one of the most underrated movie soundtracks I have heard, yet it has no reason to be. It is simplistic sometimes, but it is meant to be, and it works; just like the film."
1,dont waste your money,I bought this to remove one way screws. It was no help in doing that whatsoever. Not sure what I will use for it now??
4,"Works, not easily but I removed four one way screws with it.","Hi,In New York City apartments, the law apparently requires child guards to be installed with one way screws. I have no idea why that makes sense but I discovered this while trying to install an air conditioner yesterday.I went to the hardware store for help (my super was out of the building) and the manager at the store sold me one of these. With the instructions ""WD-40 and wack the screw with a hammer. Push it hard while you turn."". I sprayed the screws, waited a few minutes. One of the screws came right off. The others needed a couple of wacks with a hammer, and then came off pretty easily.I frankly am not sure why this device works so well, but it seems to. Overall much easier than trying to drill out the stupid things."
3,Nice but akward,"This set of earphones for my Ipod is most surely the most sturdy in its cableing and has a nice form so you can easily detect the right from the left. The biggest problem I find is that the assortment of earplugs leave me with small choices that actually fit well inside my ear. Each one (even after taking a daily Q-tip to each ear) is quick slick and falls out easily due to the type of material that they seem to be made of.I would have enjoyed something similar to the architecture of cell phone type gells that conform to the shape of the ear canal.Otherwise, they do sound great and once on I was even able to sleep listening to my favorite nighttime toons.Peace out."
4,Excellent sound but some construction problems,"Shortly after receiving my Shure E2c-n headphones I used them with my I-pod Nano for about an hour and was quite pleased with their performance. Later, however, when removing the earpieces from my ears I realized that 1/2 of the left earpiece casing was still stuck in my ear. Though it came out quite easily I could not get the earphone casing to go back together. I had thought about trying to glue it myself but decided just to return the earphones to the Shure Repair Department in Niles, IL for repair or replacement. I am assuming that this will be accomplished with no further problems."
3,"good quality, but less fine design","Shure does make very good earphones technicalwise. Its sound isolation and quality are superior.However, I have to say, compared to other earphones, this one lacks fine design at its price. For example, the string is very thicker and stiffer than other ones which make it not only less stylish but also hard to keep it in a small pocket.The way to wear it may not be too comfortable for people who wear glasses, because you have to wire the string around your ear."
3,Good Sound. Sore ears.,"Great at dampening outside sound, but the snug fit in the ear canal leaves something to be desired. The ear plugs are not as spongy and soft as I'd like and can cause the sensitive skin in your inner ear to get a little irritated.Over all though I prefer them to the standard headphones that came with me ipod. Totally recommend them for a middle market sound dampening (i wouldnt use the word cancelling here) headphones.-Aaron"
2,Difficult to fit,"You really have to work at getting a good fit on these. I tried all the shapes and sizes provided but never got them to stay in place for very long unless I really pushed them into my ears which was quite uncomfortable.These only provide good sound when you manage to get them to fit really snugly in your ear, otherwise they are very tinny. In the end I found these required way too much effort to try and get to work well and I regret buying them."
4,audio assault,"the only reason i didn't give these phones 5 stars was because they didn't perfectly replicate the in-studio audio experience. otherwise they're pretty good for the money. also, you can try them for 30 days and return them for a full refund if you're not satisfied. i guess the one knock on them, aside from not having perfect sound, is that they're a little awkward to get used to. they'll take you a week tops to figure out.highly recommended for sub $100 headphones."
2,Stop retitling..don't I have this move under another name,"Possibly the worst dubbing I've ever heard.. Although I must say the action is constant and throughout and the costumes are adequate however the actors names(Rocky & Willow) and their actions are enough to cause you to seek therapy. The climax(spoiler) oh soo stupid, consisting of a villian(who youv'e never seen) who for some reason does not know when he's won(but enjoys a good laugh!) and practically begs our dim heros to vanquish his azz. By the by this movie has nothing to do with Shoalin the cover clearly misdirection. Another strange Ocean Shores Joint!"
3,Okay Book,"I'm new to tarot and have the Universal Waite deck and bought this book to help me learn about using them. I found it not as helpful as I had hoped. I have since purchased ""Learning the Tarot"" by Joan Bunning and this is a whole lot better, for me. It gives much more indepth explainations for each card. In this book, Mastering the tarot, it's not a bad book by any means but it's a small paperback and therefore doesn't leave much room for explainations. It's a good book for beginner's but I prefer one that has more to offer."
4,Wonderful Resource Book,"This is a wonderful resource book using the Rider Waite cards as illustrations. The card descriptions lean heavily on Numerology, and the meanings that it may give to a particular card in a given situation. The Minor Arcana are grouped by number, not order, which could slow you down if you are quickly looking up the meanings for each card. There are sample readings that I found very interesting, and an in-depth chapter on life readings. The connection between Astrology and the Tarot are explored in great depth, and there are several chapters on how to do Astrological based readings using the Tarot. I especially like that the descriptions of the symbology are given for each card, and would recommend reading this book for that alone."
5,this is a very good story,I think this story is a very good story it really shows how the war really whent. my favrit character in this story was mellish well i'v seen the movie and i think he is the cutest i also like capazo he was really cool i think uhpum was a bit of a wimp but apart from that i think it was really cool.If i was to give this movie/book a raiting out of 100 i would give it 100 becaust it is so good.
3,good but needs some improvments,"pros:it is good, compact/light and sturdy (stiffness like a german BMw...)cons:hard plastic safe locks (with some sharp edges), very rough to your palm skins each time you turn to lock or unlock. they should have used RUBBER!lack of a straplack of a foam sleeving"
5,I love this sketchbook!,"This is the first review I have written on anything, ever. But, as an artist, I am telling you that this is the best sketchbook you will ever find...I carry it around with me everywhere...the more distressed it gets, the better it looks. I also love the way it closes (it folds over with a slightly magnetic clasp that is not visible). That attention to detail is wonderful!"
2,disappointed,"I thought that this fits over the cabinet door, however, it doesn't, it needs to be mounted and the screws are too thick for a cabinet door."
4,What happens with only one box of wraps,"Easy to install and sturdy, but if you only have one box of wraps in the rack it will fall right into the slots along the sides. I had to make a modification to it to prevent that. Otherwise it's great."
3,eh,"I didn't really find a message in the book, it was pretty unbiased. It just stated the facts, told about his life and what he went through, it was a long list of facts. I agree with the book in the sense that it shows how one person can work from a low position in a company and end up having so much power."
3,Real American Dream,"I didnft know the fact that president of Coca Cola, which is one of the most prestigious American companies, was born in Cuba As a recent Japanese trend, we are facing the word gGlobal Standardh many times in TV, newspaper or some business magazines. But I canft imagine that president of a traditional Japanese company, even at SONY or HONDA, which is recognized as a global company in Japan, would be foreigner. Reading through this book, I was impressed not only for Goizuetafs ability, but also for the American business environment to accept an excellent person even if he is foreigner."
4,Inspirational story of a great leader.,"The book is an interesting journey about Roberto Goizueta. The book takes you from his days in pre Castro Cuba to his days at the top of Coke. Unfortunately, it is an unauthorized biography so Roberto was not interviewed for the book. However, the book is critical for any person looking for great leadership examples."
3,Damian Lewis movie review,"This turned out to be kind of a silly movie, but it was entertaining. I am a huge Damian Lewis fan, so I was happy just to see him, and the character he played was much different than Band of Brothers or Life so that was interesting as well."
5,These are WONDERFUL,These get better and better the more you use them and they take a TON of abuse.Boil them when you first get them and they will quilt up beautifully. These are totally worth the money.
2,Not as good as Bummis,"I bought a dozen of these diapers after using Bummi's prefolds for several months because I was looking for something a little cheaper. Well, they were and they are. I've washed them at least 6 times now (I only had to wash the Bummis 3 times before they were ""ready for use"") and they're STILL not absorbing well. My son has had many leaks down the leg with them because they're not absorbing immediately. While very soft now that they're washed, they have gotten very wrinkly and seem like they're not going to hold up as long as the Bummi's Organics because the weave is less tight. I can't say I would recommend these. I'm going back to buy more Bummi's."
4,Amber Brown Goes Forth,"This is a wonderful book. Amber is entering the fourth grade with all of the normal concerns. Along with this, she is also upset about her best friend, Justin, moving away, and her father and mother being divorced. Amber is able to meet a new girl the first day and decides that she will have a new best friend and life does go on. This is a quick, easy read and one that can be read out loud as well."
1,Do not buy. Poor Quality Camera,Junk. Pictures turn out bad. They should be better for such an exspensive camera.All of the pictures had a red wash to them that would not go away.
4,Elegant and unique,"Not your everyday anime, Tale of Genji is beautifully drawn and quietly engaging. It isn't for the anime action fan. But if you enjoy great art and interesting characters in an historic Japanese setting, don't pass ths up."
2,The Dinosaur of books on transsexuality,"I admit that I purchased this book in 1978.Being 20 years old,I did read it the same way parents in the 50's were reading Dr. Spock's books in order to help them raise their children.(Spock had the decency to admit in the 70's that his advice was outdated).Thank god in 2007,things have changed for the transgendered community.I only hope that this book will not be read by young people considering transsexuality.If they do and if they are reading this book as a reference,I shiver.Get this book if you wish to learn just how much progress has been made in tolerance,information and knowledge about the implications of a sex-change operation.Conclusion:A dangerous book if put in the wrong hands"
5,Mainstage Surround Sound Speaker System,"I am very pleased with the quality of this product. The stereo speakers on my television set have never worked perfectly, emitting an unpleasant, tinny sound at certain frequencies. The Mainstage system has completely corrected that problem. CD's now sound wonderful, especially as compared with how they formerly sounded. I couldn't be more pleased with this product than I am."
3,Enjoyable,"This is a thoroughly entertaining piece of tripe, where a stalwart cast handle an intriguing set of episodes encased in a clever framework story. Some viewers may be inclined to laugh at the film's excesses, but its high points, particularly the conclusion, really do stay with you. Recommended."
1,Waste of money,I bought two bonsai trees from this company thinking I could handle them. I'm usually quite good at working with plants but the two trees this company sent me were determined to die. I followed directions to the letter and was still unable to make them work. Save your cash and look elsewhere.
3,Interesting Combination of Science and Scripture,"If you're just starting to learn about the Shroud, Lavoie's work is not where I would recommend starting. Nevertheless, his fairly unique interpretation of Scripture makes the book stand out.The book is worth the read for Chapter 11 alone. While I can't say I was wholly convinced that Lavoie's analysis was reasonable, the mental exercise of inserting the Shroud into John's Gospel is stimulating.There are plenty of arguments for the authenticity of the Shroud, and Lavoie touches on many of them. The medical/forensic approach is worthwhile and competent. I would say that the ""Carbon Dating"" section has been overtaken by more recent research (also supporting authenticity).The book is engaging, and written in a revelatory style that seems particularly appropriate to the long and complex story of the Shroud."
2,Good,Nice R&B album. I think all except Bitter will stay on my computer. Four star for the song. But it looses 2 star due to the copy-protection; installs itself without warning when I forgot to turn off autoplay. Evil.
3,Good .. but not Great,"I love the very first song. Very upbeat and danceable.But the CD kind of wavers from that point on as a mixed bag of hit and miss songs.Chante has a lovely voice and very clear for it to be in such a high register.But there was a song or two on this project that just missed it, for me.Nevertheless, this is now one of her older CDs and she's evolved since havingmade this one.It's still an enjoyable CD, but not her best. In my humble opinion."
4,A review by a REAL Chante fan,"The people who gave this album such negative reviews obviously didn't make it past the first 5 tracks, seeing as how ""Bitter"" is pretty much the only song mentioned on a consistent basis (OMG she used the ""N"" word! Somebody call Farrakhan! Give me a break...).The tempo may have been turned up a few notches, but Chante is still singing about what Chante has always sang about: love, relationships, and intimacy. People need to stop focusing on the beats and pay attention to the lyrics, which, with the exception of the slang-heavy ""Straight Up,"" pretty much sound like they could have come out of any of her previous 3 albums.Chante didn't do a disservice to her fans, her fans did a disservice to her by being so shallow and closed-minded, and as such, missed out on an album that, despite its missteps, is a solid effort worthy of being a Chante album."
4,Not useful for InstallShield Professional users,"Don't buy this book hoping to get any insight into InstallShield Professional. The two products are so dissimilar that about the only useful information in it would be in regards to the InstallScript language. I have yet to locate a book that deals exclusively with InstallShield Professional. For InstallShield Professional, the most useful source of information I've found is the knowledgebase (http://support.installshield.com/kb/)."
4,"Good Book, but...","This book is very good. Anything (with the exception I note below) I needed regarding this product, I could find in this book. I had, however, from the publisher's calling it ""comprehensive,"" hoped for documentation of the Automation Interface. There is no significant coverage of this important interface to this product."
1,not as advertised,"This 4 GB card is suppose to have a switch so that you can use the card as two 2GB partitions, but the switch is missing. I contacted Blue Proton, but they told me I had to contact Sandisk. I don't think that is right since I bought the product from Blue Proton and not Sandisk."
5,HANDSOME HARRY,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. ACTING AND DIRECTING TOP-NOTCH. WHY ARE'NT MORE MOVIES MADE WITH SUCH CARE? BRAVO TO ALL INVOLVED.
1,"Too much money, not enough action.","You can get a bundle of UFC 40-50, plus Ultimate Knockouts 1 & 2 from Sherdog.com for only $99 with free shipping. I would highly recommend that bundle over this one."
1,Awful!,"These are absolutely the worst nuts I have ever eaten... and I got a CASE of them!! I wanted a Planters type taste, and boy, were these not that!! I couldn't give them away!! Will never purchase this product again. BLECHK!!!"
3,"Great songs but hello, Lennon had more to cover","This is a valiant effort, and the songs that are here are terrific, but was it really necessary to include TWO versions of ""Imagine"" and ""Gimme Some Truth""? What's the point when there is so much more Lennon material out there? Another beef: where are Julian and Sean? Other than that, great disc for a great cause. Tons of talent. Highlights for me include Green Day and Jakob Dylan with Dhani Harrison (at least Dhani showed up)."
3,"Good refurbishing work of ""The Great Johnnie"" classics!","I consider that original scores from Rock music milestones (i.e. Elvis, Beatles [group and solo efforts], Janis Joplin, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Stones, Elton John, Grateful Dead, Santana, Yes, among others) shouldn't be material for 'one-and-thousand' cover versions.However in this ""Instant Karma"", there are some very interesting pieces: Youssou N'Dour makes a beautiful work with ""Jealous Guy"", his mellow voice redefines this song! As Jack Johnson does with ""Imagine"", even when the original version by John Lennon is, no doubt about it, a unique musical piece.Versions to be considered as ""new"" classics: ""Instant Karma"" by U2 (excellent vocal work by Bono, bravo!)... But the Blue Ribbon of the collection goes to Michael Stipe and R.E.M. for their version of ""#9 Dream""... Simply superb!!!!(Latin American fans: be careful, do not buy the Argentinian edition of ""Instant Karma""... The sound quality is ""Instant Dissapointment""!!!)"
3,"Poorly edited, assumes a bit much","Really poorly edited book. Broken sentences, missing words; really bad.The book assumes a bit of knowledge on the subject and is clearly intended from somebody who has working animals in a farm/ranch setting."
1,Do not buy it !!!,Don't buy it. My NEC DVD RW drive (model: ND 3520A. it is a 8X DVD+RW drive) does not not recognize it. I use NERO ULTRA V.7.
4,The King Of the Ring!,"When I first saw this movie, I wasn't really expecting much. There are a few things in all Elvis movies that are the same (He sings, gets the girl, and everything works out in the end.) But I wasn't expecting to get wrapped up in this great 1963 boxing movie. Elvis plays a young man who takes up boxing just to make some money. This movie is wicked cheesy, but it is really good. About half way through the movie, you will realize that you really do like this movie. It's a guilty pleasure, and it's a knock out!"
1,Not of good quality,This product came with scratches and the item was not of the quality for the money. The oval wasn't even true (flat on one side)
1,Not so great,I bought this one because I love the other one so much. A. 2000. Awesome workout but this one is pretty much like the other with few exceptions. If you have the first one then you definitely don't need to bother with this one.
3,Fall Warmth,"Living in Germany I feel this is a great item for Fall but for Winter I will definitely have to layer up my child. I find it to be a great size. I am a tad bit leery to wash it, as I am afraid it will not do so well in the machine."
3,Loved this phone until recently,I absolutely loved this phone for 2 years and all of its features. Now I have an issue and it has been discontinued with Panasonic.My issue is the battery will be fully charged and for no apparant reason will go dead in the middle of a conversation. It will flash set date and time. I have moved closer to the base etc and nothing works. The date and time are set and the battery is fully charged but it will be dead for hours. Now another time I may pick up the phone and talk for hours.Tech. support says it is discontinuted and will give me a discount on another phone.I love this phone and the features but not working properly. I even purchased an 2 extra dandsets and the remote camera. I love that feature. Now all that money was spent for nothing.Very upset with this issue. I have not read here that anyone else has had this problem???
5,Great startoff to the onslaught series,Great book worthy of a 5 star review. Its great how the chacters develop & how the book starts the story off. Its too bad how the author has akroma destroy almost everything Ixidor created when he created her in the first place though. Ixidor was one of the best chacters in the book in my opinion however that dosn't change the fact that this was a great startoff to the onslaught series & most definatly deserving of 5-stars.
2,interesting but unsatisfying,"there are a number of vignettes in this book that are interesting, however the general tone of the book is very America centric, perhaps with an underlying tone of ""we won"", which detracts from those essays that are more balanced. Generally this was unsatisfying, frustrating eneough to write this review, as although the better essays are quite good, overall there is a lack of substance.However, the title is a tad misleading ."
5,Highly recommended for *everyone*!,"""Dear Cheyenne"" is a must for *everyone*. For those of us who have not lost a child, this book gives a deep understanding of what it is like to lose a child. Anyone who has ever said to a beareaved parent ""you're young, you can have another child"" does not understand the tragic loss of a child. While this statement may be true, no child can replace another. Through author Joanne Cacciatore's eyes, you will gain empathy, compassion and understanding of what it is like to lose a child."
5,"Joanne Cacciatore's,book is just wonderful!!!!!","Joanne writes her book from the depths of her heart, she feels so much love for her child and can vebalize it the way all beareved parents would like to be able to. I truely don't think I've ever read a book that touched my heart and soul as Dear Cheyenne did.While very hard to read thru my tears,I really didn't ever want to get to the end of it .I hope Joanne keeps giving all of us the support she has shown us in her writings,We need more wonderful people as she to help us go thru our grief. Thank you joanne!!!!!"
3,Sadly Disappointed,"We bought this nursery for our 2 1/2 year old for Christmas. We received the toy on Christmas Eve, so we began assembling it that night. There were a ton of small piece, but to our surprise, over half of the nursery was missing and then we had doubles of other pieces. Unfortunately, we were unable to complete the assemble because there were not enough pieces and our daughter had no ""big"" toy for Christmas morning. :( Quite a disappointment."
1,frustrating!,"I love the idea of this toy, but I have been extremely frustrated trying to assemble it (I'm on day two and at least hour four). Its not that the directions aren't good, but there are a million parts and they are all stuck together with plastic pieces that leave very sharp nobs on the toy when you separate them. I am afraid my girls are going to cut themselves on the plastic pieces while playing with this toy. Its also very difficult to get the pieces to line up properly so doors are askew even before the kids start to play with it. :("
4,Great nursery!,"My girls loved this nursery and played with it for about two days, then it fizzled off as do all toys once they get bored. But they LOVED it! I might move it our of my youngest daughters room and into the playroom where they will see it more and probably play with it more. But overall this is an awesome nursery. Loved how the monitor talks when you are feeding, bathing or putting baby doll to sleep. I didn't know it did that!"
4,"Good toy, Good value","Both my 2 and 5 year old daughters are enjoying this toy. There is plenty of room for two children to play with this toy at the same time. It was a great value and a great toy. It does have many pieces to assemble, and my husband spent about 1 hour putting it together. I might suggest that you assemble before giving it as a gift. My children were very anxious to play with it."
3,Cheaply made,I was very excited when this arrived for my daughter but was very disappointed when we started to assemble it. All of the plastic pieces are still attached to each other so when you separate them there are sharp points everywhere. It comes in a ridiculous amount of pieces. While assembling it a piece broke off the door so we had to superglue it to make the door stay on. My daughter likes it but it is really small she has to get on her knees to really use the whole thing and many of her average size baby dOlls don't even fit in it.
1,Ring is Nice...Customer Service Stinks!!!,I purchased the ring as a surprise gift not knowing the proper ring size at the time. According to the website you can exchange the ring for a different size within 60 days so I figured I would just go ahead and purchase and then exchange after the surprise was given. They ask that you email them first before you send the ring back to ensure they set aside the correct size for shipment. I have sent three emails now asking for authorization to return the ring with no response. We like the ring but it would be nice if they would be concerned with customer satisfaction! We won't be doing anymore business with this seller.
4,"Motorola compatible ""Mini USB"" Razor Phone Charger","The original unit was DOA, but an email got another unit shipped. I simply had to mail the other unit back free of charge. 5-stars for the merchant, 4-stars for charger. The charger does not have folding AC prongs, like my original OEM charger (and the one pictured in the photo), so not as travel friendly."
5,Compensating Sales Force,This is an excelent book by the top author on Sales pay. Very understandable and good tatical knowledge.
3,"If you love chart and graphs, this is your book","I don't find them very useful, I was looking for more simplified information for my very small business. I can see where this would be very helpful in a large organizition, but this was overkill for me."
1,Cheap and broken with little use,Got one and it manage to break itself and come undone and not useable after 33days. Just outside of warranty.Save yourself some trouble and if you need one get it somewhere else besides amazon.
1,Useless adivce with a huge focus on Christianity,"Nowhere on the book jacket does it mention that this book is written from an entirely Christian point of view. Advice such as making sure to nurture your husband, and remembering he deserves respect because he is ""a child of God"" made me angry and totally annoyed I'd spent money on this book. As a former trial attorney, now stay at home Mom, I thought I would relate to this book. So not true, bummer."
4,Wonderful!,Dr. Miller lived and preached with a gentle soul in Persia (current-day Iran) for over 40 years. I knew Dr. Miller personally and he never stopped living his faith - until he joined Jesus at the age of 100!This book is a wonderful account of how Dr. Miller shared the Gospel with those who were seeking the real truth in a country that at one time was open to missions and ministries other than Islam.
5,Phantasmagoria,"Phantasmagoria will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire way through. Sierra Studios has spoiled me with their interesting games and exceptional graphics. I've been playing Sierra games for about 20 years. I have some of their first games. I like Phantasmagoria because it's so life-like, you'll feel as if you're in the game. Buy it, you'll be glad you did."
5,Incredible Bargain On An Excellent Piece of Software,"As another reviewer mentioned, this is, indeed, Deep Fritz 8 packaged under a different title. Whether you have a single processor or a dual-processor computer this is a super application.If you do have a dual-processor machine then you've got a top 10 piece of chess software. Deep Fritz 8 is ranked 10th on both the CEGT site and the SSDF website with ratings of 2793 and 2783, respectively.And contrary to another reviewer, Fritz 9 is almost twice the price of this product (comparing Amazon prices today). And for the extra dollars you really don't get any more power. Fritz 9 is ranked 11th (CEGT) and 6th (SSDF). Why pay more for essentially the same playing-strength? Not to mention the fact that some users have complained about the bugs in Fritz 9."
3,pleasant and gentle stretching video,"It's a shame the packaging is so badly done because the video itself is quite nice - perfect for light exercise before bedtime. The model on the front cover, who never appears in the video, is wearing sneakers; sneakers are not necessary. But you do need a stretchy exercise band or a long towel, which is never mentioned on the box, as far as I can tell. The last two segments are mislabeled. Segment 2 is primarily lower body (not upper) and vice-versa for segment 3. This is more of a mild toning and stretching video, which is a letdown for people who believe they are getting a ""DYNAMIC firming and flexing"" program (as the title implies). Lakey gives clear instructions, exhibits a positive and motivating personality, and all the demonstrators use good form. The music, light drum and harp, is soft and pleasant. I really do like this video. If it were properly labeled I'd give it 4 stars."
3,Good Supplement - But Not a First Choice,"I purchased two Pilates videos last January and began using them on regular basis. The Denise Austin video is better at strength building. Occasionally I use Dynamic Firming and Flexing to vary the muscle groups, but I never feel as if I have received the full benefit from the time spent."
2,Not for Items Requiring a Needle,"Although the write-up said it inflates just about anything, and specifically mentioned exercise balls, it will not work with items needing a needle nozzle.I spoke to customer service and they were very nice, but the rep said the item is made for large inflatables - tubes, rafts, etc. I asked about using an adapter for the needle (many exercise balls come with these) and he said that would not work. He reiterated that the item is made for large inflatables. He could be wrong in terms of adapters, but I don't know yet.It may be a good product, but the write-up needs to be adjusted. It simply doesn't do what the write-up says. I gave it a 2 because customer service was good."
4,Works Great!,"Other than it being too large for me to travel with, it works great and pumps so much faster than anything else out there. The shipping was a bit expensive, I thought, but in the end it was worth it."
3,Traditional folk meets Steve Tilston,"I first stumbled onto Steve Tilston and Maggie Boyle in a used CD store in Kansas City. I wanted some traditional folk to expand my CD ""collection"" (I think I had all of 10 CDs at the time). I really enjoyed their unique blend of Steve's songwriting and Maggie's choice of traditional ballads with Steve's reinvention of them. When I saw All Under the Sun in the used bin in St. Paul, MN, I grabbed it. It's easy on the ears--a good sunny afternoon kind of CD. It follows the same formula--songs that showcase Tilston's singer/songwriter/instrumentalist ability, interspersed with traditional ballads sung by Boyle. Boyle also provides some great flute throughout the album. I wouldn't call the album revolutionary or cutting edge, but I really enjoy it."
3,"Good price, but two flaws","Flaw 1: Loose fit? Not really... Feels too tight.Flaw 2: Only two pockets (below the normal two) --- The ""large"" side pockets are not all that big - I can barely fit my Kindle Fire into each pocket, and there really needs to be an outer smaller pocket on each side pocket for smaller items such as cell phones or camera gear.Bottom line = you get a basic version of cargo pants for a cheap price."
3,no inmediate result,"I have taken them for a week, and no visible results, will finish them to see what happens. Some months ago, I finished up a bottle of xenadrine and didn't get any results either"
3,it's not bad actually,it's not bad & it gives results after a few days but it's not the best but according to it's price it's ok
4,Very readable account of Americans at their best.....,"In 215 pages, the author, John Curtis Perry managed to captured the basic essence of the American Occupation of Japan after World War II. From the way he writes, it appears to be one of America's finest hours, both as a nation and as a people. Rarely has the two foes who fought such a bitter war against each other, kiss and made up so quickly. As a people, Americans proves to be very magnanimous victors and interestingly enough, the Japanese were very agreeable losers. The book also revealed Douglas MacArthur at his best and considering all the things that should have gone wrong, it was pretty amazing that it went so right. Short, interesting and well written, a very good introductory book on the subject matter."
3,From KLF to Raggae-Soul,"Maxine is the known voice of KLF (""3AM eternal"", ""Mu Mu land""). There she sung dance tracks. Here she sings a mix of Raggae and Soul. It is quite nice, but somehow you get the impression that the production is not high quality. it's an ok album for a good mood and a soulfeeling"
2,Not well written,"Whoever edited this book didn't do a great job. I read this after just reading Shadow Divers and the difference in writing skills are considerable. The author didn't do a good job of figuring out how to lay out the stories he wanted to tell. He'd go off on tangents in a jarring way that was off-putting, or expand on minutia that wasn't really pertinent to the main thread of the book. It was hard to become engrossed the stories as a result, unlike Shadow Divers. I would just skim quickly through pages when the narrative would digress and by the last half of the book, I was mainly reading it because, hell, I bought it. Do yourself a favor and skip it."
2,Reads more like a magazine than a book,"After reading ""the Last Dive"" I had great hopes for this book. But it was very disappointing, little depth or background, reads much more like a magazine article pulled together two minutes to deadline. I returned it for a refund -- glad I did."
2,Dosen't give off enough lite.,Found it to be quite useless in illuminating my pc keyboard.Ordered the 6 LED version and that works satisfactorily.
1,Great Idea,"Would be a better product, if it can be turned off, instead of pulling the USB connection from it's power source."
2,Did Not Last Long,You get what you pay for. The price was very attractive. It was shipped from Hong Kong on the slow boat. When it finally arrived I was disappointed with the quality. The light diffusing lens would not stay put. No problem. A drop of super glue will solve this. Worked fine for a couple days. After that it would not emit enough light to see anything. Don't waste your money.
2,"Works, but I would look elsewhere","For my purposes this is too dim and the light cast is too narrow (focused). I was hoping to use it to illuminate my laptop keyboard in a dark/dim room, and/or to illuminate a printed page nearby. It barely performs the first task, and fails utterly at the second. I probably need one of those multi-LED arrays. Oh well.The build quality seems solid, for what it's worth. If you just need a touch of light this might work for you. Not me."
2,Not Sturdy,"This LED light is not sturdy at all. When you plug it in it will lean over and almost unplug itself. The light is also not very omni directional, it is focused on one spot. I read lots of reviews, and sort of blow off ones that are bad. I read one about this one that was bad and overlooked it and purchased it anyway. I regret it very much. The packaging was also not very well either. You can tell this is not a great product at all. Please take my advice and find another item similar."
1,Dont buy,I had to solder one of two. and they dont light up the key borad very good.Thay were'nt worth even the $4.00 for both....
1,Very poor lighting provided,"This thing provides less light when aimed directly at the keyboard than the laptop screen does with the screen pointed slightly upward. It's very, very bad. Yes, it's only a few bucks, but it's not even worth that. Seriously. I'll be returning my simply for the principle of the thing.EDIT: It fell apart a few days after I wrote this review and I just threw it away. It's a real piece of junk."
5,Love it,Its perfect lighting I do a lot of traveling and this light does not overheat when used for hour. I also like the way it is not overly bright just right.
2,small light small value,does not give off much light.I need a light a bit more luminous .So basically I would not recommend this sorry.
3,OK for the price,"I will just say, that for the price ($3) it's better than nothing, but not by much. I have a 17.3"" laptop with black keys and I thought a little light source would help when I am working in the twilight hours. However, the light is not strong enough to light up the entire keyboard; it basically spot lights whatever area it is pointing to. If I pull the light up to cover a wider area, it is not stable in the usb port and starts to wobble and fall over. AND, the light itself does not eluminate well enough. In the position shown in the picture on Amazon, it lights up an area of about 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Also, as other viewers indicated, it does not have a switch, you have to insert it to turn it on and pull it out to turn it off. I thought this would not bug me, but it does. On a side note, my daughter thinks it makes a wonderful weapon and pokes me with it. I don't like that either. :) (NOTE: It was wobbly BEFORE she found another use for it)."
2,on the road to freedom,this was just an average cd. the song so sad is the best one on it. i had not heard of any of the other songs. this was more of a folk album. i like some folk music but this was not too good.
5,Postmodernism Prevails,"This book is extraordinary at capturing the issues of adolesence in America, and how this intrinsically marginalized group has braved the challenge of being both insiders (adults) and outsiders (kids) with the assistance of drugs and rock in roll. In many ways I think that we idealize the 60's for their rebelliousness, the freedom of the times. But freedom has a price as is revealed in Bromell's Chapter', vilis live Spelled Backwards.' To question society, to question oneself, and the system is disettling, it is dangerous, there are no answers and how does one deal with that reality? Bromell captures these contradictions and complexities in a postmodern interdisciplinary style that is frighteningly penetrating. I may not be a child of the sixties, but his writing is so profound I think that it exceeds the limits of time."
2,Dull regurgitations and sterile ruminations,"This book is the equivalent of an overly long and wannabe-contemplative VH1 ""documentary."" With the acknowledgment of how hard it is to capture the essence of the 60s' music and its society, this book then goes on to underwhelmingly live up to that observation. With self-important theorizing on the meaning of this-and-that, and hackneyed philosophizing on the significance of some banal lyrics or events, this book attempts to pass off various cliches as meaningful metaphors for other cliches. Nothing much is really said, nothing interesting is really brought out by his observations, and his attempts at capturing meaning leave one with the sense of ""So What?"".This book is another in a tired line of works on the sixties based on repititious mythologies and platitudes. It's useful if you are looking for some form of validation; however, one would be better off sticking to VH1."
3,Kat's Kind Review,The book I Knew Two Who Said Moo by Judi Barrett was a good book for the most part. It would be a good book for children that are younger. But if you were over the age of 7 this book probably would not be a good one for you. It is a book about counting and rhyming. She starts with the number 1 and goes to the number ten. She writes a couple of sentences on each page and the last word in every sentence rhymes with the number that you are reading. There is really no Plot to the book except that it shows younger children hoe to count and rhyming words. It is actually an amusing book but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to people that aren't within the ages of 2-7.
1,SUCKS,SCREW YOU NEIL ORMEROD THIS BOOK SUCKS! IF I COULD GIVE YOU 0 STARS I WOULD! I HATE YOU BOOK ITS THE WORST THING AND SO BORING AND DUMB AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND
4,pink panther,My daughter ordered this and loved it. The stickers are very high quality and well made. They are too nice to stick on anything so she looks at the book.
1,Confusing even when Dr Rains himself is teaching the class,"This textbook, requires a level of understanding that is not found in most undergraduate psychology students. Even when Dr. Rains himself was teaching the class, the book was entirely confusing. This textbook is not user friendly and certainly does not achieve the goal of teaching psychology students about cognitive neuropsychology."
4,Mean Spirit far from mean,"A beautiful book, Mean Spirit explores a sad time in American history. Set in Oklahoma, the book traces what happens to the oil-rich Indians as greedy, exploiters do whatever it takes to claim the land as theirs."
1,"Bunk, sophmoric","While there are some top-notch planners included in this book, far too many are simply buddies of the editor who have accomplished little in their careers. The editor offers his usual perversion of the latest pop trends to tie it all together. Much sloganizing, little of substance."
5,Best fun I've had in writing---,"I was lucky enough to be included in the BUBBA CHRONICLES because of a story Selina and I wrote one long weekend (""Extremely Odd Jobs""). I'm even luckier, because Selina Rosen is one of the most witty, talented and creative writers I've ever met---and working with her gave me a chance to stretch some writing muscles I hadn't used before. Read Selina's work and give yourself a treat. ""Prom Date"" still makes me laugh hard enough to make my ribs hurt (even after a half-dozen readings). If you aren't falling down laughing after reading this collection, I suspect you're dead."
2,"Good cast, lousy script","Too bad Schumacher had to go and waste the talents of Carrey and Madsen in this dreck. Poorly written scripts never, ever make good movies. Too many coincidences, too many things that should have been obvious to the character, too much reliance on editing and coloring instead of on plot.And the ending, with a person figuring out repressed memories--ooh, how original is that? What a cliche. How could a horror movie be so dull? Too bad."
1,`Number 23' a big ZERO,"I'm sorry, but this movie is a total piece of garbage. All of these fine actors have wasted their time. I've never seen such a disjointed pile of nonsense in all my life. It's a giant mess. It's not scary, suspenseful, or interesting, nor does the story make a lick of sense. As a viewer, I felt cheated and insulted by the ham-handed way the filmmakers cobbled together a ""surprise"" ending. The only reason it could be seen as a surprise is due to the fact that you wouldn't believe professional writers and filmmakers would attempt to provide such a ridiculous and implausible solution to their story. To make matters worse, I didn't like the way the picture was shot either; particularly the ""fantasy"" sequences, which I found jarringly annoying. They upset what little mood the film had and took me out of the story.Don't allow the well-edited trailer fool you. I wouldn't suggest you give this aggravating movie even a minute of your time."
3,"A good idea, poorly realized","As a fan of the intellectual and psychological thriller/drama (eg, Se7en, Pi, Magnolia) I had high hopes for this movie. The opening credits succeeded in drawing me in, with a number of ""coincidences"" being stated as fact, all making connections to the number 23.I really thought this was going to be a great movie. In fact, the story started out with pretty good potential. Unfortunately, this movie suffers from the same telegraphing symptoms of other high-budget let-downs, like the DaVinci Code, or Secret Window. Every twist is seen coming far in advance, and the plot is paper thin. It's a thin plot that tells the story of a story.I think it's a sign of a weak writer when you write a story about a story, making that sub-story out to be great. It's as if the writer imagines his story as great, but knows it's not, so he has to write a story around it to cast it in a better light. Well, that's how it looks to me, anyway."
4,The Number 23 - thrilling and exciting!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this mysterious, intriguing film. I went into the theatre knowing nothing about the movie except that it was about the number 23, the main character was seeing the number everywhere, and Jim Carrey plays that main character. Little did I know that the movie would unwind into a scary obsession with the number 23 - an obsession that led to extreme paranoia, murder, mystery, and a little red book penned by a mysterious author. Jim Carrey shines in this compelling, dark thriller. Highly recommended!"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Number 23 succeeds in being atmospheric but that's where the accolades stop; a pointless and predictable thriller that recycles lots of tired cliches and ends with an eye-roller, it's not worth watching, let alone buying."
2,"Dull, plodding, clumbsy psycho-drama","We got this the week it came out, my wife said it was so bad she didn't want to watch it again, which is unusual for her. I didn't give in until today. I could have waited another few years and it wouldn't have helped.The only good thing about this film was the song that played during the closing credits.Trust me... there are better ways to spend your time1 1/2 *"
4,God save The Queen (of Technicolor!),"Dumas' Three Musketeers have been treated reverently, seriously, light-heartedly, and as farce. This time it's light-heartedly. The call goes out from the besieged Queen of France. The Princess, Her daughter, is being forced into a marriage which will threaten her younger Brother's chances of suceeding their Father (now deceased) Who can be trusted to spirit the Dauphin across the border to friends in Spain? The Three Musketeers! Sadly, though, their days of derring-do are far behind them. The Answer: Their Sons! (Oops, one of them is a Girl!) Ah well, any chance to get a sword into Maureen O'Hara's hand is only to the good. Cornel Wilde is at his dashing best, and the supporting characters are very well cast. A Pleasant way to spend a free Saturday afternoon, and Yes, the kids can watch it too!"
1,Who wrote this book?,"I've read several of Thomas Cook's books, including THE CHATHAM SCHOOL AFFAIR and RED LEAVES, both well-written, insightful page-turners (putting aside the obvious flaw in RED LEAVES).Short of a mental breakdown, there is no way the author of the above outstanding novels (and others) could have penned this sophomoric book. Populated by wooden characters; infused with barren description; steeped in empty, simple and inane dialogue; the book reads like the work of a middle-schooler."
2,A change for the worse,"I couldn't agree more with ""avidreader"". Peril is unrecognisable as Thomas H. Cook novel. The prevous books I've read, The Chatham School Affair, Evidence of Blood, Mortal Memory, and Instruments of Night are the work of a master storyteller. They are filled with atmosphere, empathy, and often sadness, but written with a wonderfully engaging style that few authors can imitate. Then along comes Peril - a plot full of cliches, caricatures and coincidences. Hopefully its just an experiment and we'll soon have the ""real"" Thomas H. Cook back writing great stuff again."
2,"Thirteen, just OK","When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be a good movie, but when I watched it, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I was excepting more realistic things in the movie, but as a story line, it was really good. And since I'm 19, it probably seems less realistic than it would have if I watched it when I was younger. I'd say this movie was OK, but I dont know if I'd watch it again. There were good parts in it, and some so-so parts. My neighbor borrowed it and said it was just OK and that she was expecting more from it. I hope this helps some."
5,A hidden deleted scene on the DVD!!,"There is a hidden deleted scene that you can find and here is how to find it:On 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment's release of the teenage drama 'Thirteen' the studio has added a deleted scene, hidden from immediate view. Here is how to get to it.Insert the fullscreen version of the DVD in your player and on the Main Menu select 'Special Features.' On the following screen highlight the menu entry 'Making Of Featurette' and then press the 'Right' directional key on your remote control to highlight the number '13.' Now, press 'enter' and you will get to see a deleted scene of improvisation from the intervention.This is not a big deal scene but, at least it is an extra goodie to take a look at. Just wanted to let those of you who have the DVD know about this."
5,Amazing and True,"I have an old friend that went through this exact same situation(s). This movie was amazing, true, and eye-opening. This is what happens in real life and it is all real...there is nothing fake about it. This is the best realistic movie about teenage girls that I have ever seen in my life! Nothing else compares to this. The cinematography is amazing; the movie is done very, very well. I can't say how much this movie hit home or otherwise - it is just great and it is truely my favorite movie ever!10 out of 5 stars for Thirteen!"
3,Its giving Ideas,"Overall a very good movie...but its giving teenages ideas. Because of this movie, Hundreds of teenagers are now cutting themselves just to get attention. Cutting is now a normal part of growing up. They think cutting is the only way to get attention. Again, overall this is a great movie."
4,Like pain? This movie is for you,"This is a movie about adolescent pain. Physical, emotional, and mental pain. I don't know if this is an ""entertaining"" movie, but for the most part it gave a grungy realistic view of two teenagers, who try to escape the pain of their home lives by drowning it in the excessive pain of their teenage adventures (if you want to call them that).I will say the two leads give a better performance here than they do on their current vampire related endeavors (True Blood & Twilight)."
5,worth it!,"Thirteen is a true emotional roller coaster that deal with adolescent drug and sex abuse. It also deals with teen depression and peer pressure. Tracy meets Evie, the most popular girl in school and from there Tracy is put into a world she knows nothing about. From dressing sexier, to smoking pot and having multiple sexual partners Tracy begins to spin out of control. As the months go by Tracy once a prostigious student turns into a self mutilating substance abusing thirteen year old girl. Evie even manipulates herself into Tracy's mother's life and the end result is nothing pretty. This is a must see movie."
2,It's a Lifetime Movie...,"My expectations weren't terrifically high. If, as reported this was written (in part) by a thirteen year old, then she did a fine job. However, as pure cinema...This flick is highly overrated.So, she slept with guys, did drugs, shop-lifted, and wore slutty clothes...Again, it's all Lifetime quality fare. I found nothing compelling about the characters and I wasn't the least bit invested in their outcome...In fact, while watching, I found my attention wavering, quite a bit.After Kids, films like this just don't have the same shock-value."
2,"Hollywood ""Honesty""","This is pure Hollywood honesty as opposed to the brutal honesty of a movie like ""Kids"". Yes some kids are bad, Yes some kids grow up too fast but this movie is almost comical in how evil they make the 13 year old girl. I can actually see the writer sitting on the set thinking up more ways to screw this girl up in the film. If you can take it for what its worth and not a social commentary on kids these days then you'll get a few chuckles."
1,The most overrated film in the last ten years.,"A really bad ABC After School Special. If you need any more evidence of the ""dumbing down of America"", than here it is. I can't believe that so many critics liked this pile of crap."
5,Changes my view on life completly!,"This movie was so well put together to be a low budget film! Although I myself am nothing but a teenager, it changed my whole view on teens and the things we do. I can't believe these girls are only 13 doing some of the things they do. All I have to say is this will change your life and the way you view young adults."
5,Excellent,"This movie was very intense,watched it for my sociology class on Juvenile Deliquency and it showed how close to real issue's like these are.. highly recommend it..."
1,Who should be Committed?,"I put in a search for A SUMMER PLACE on DVD and it brings me to this movie called COMMITTED. This has happened several times and I should have known better. I'm human. I forgot. I finally decided to watch it. A friend of mine let me borrow it. I decided that anybody who actually bought or rented this movie should be committed. The cover should have warned me right off the bat. But I was mildly intrigued by some prurient interest I suppose. I grant you, this movie is different. It's bad but it's a different sort of bad. Since my original search was for A SUMMER PLACE I would say this movie is twice as bad as the worst movie you can recall from your viewing disappointments. Good searching."
4,"Unique, collage-like storytelling","The dreamy, montage format of this movie is hypnotic, giving you tastes and smells rather than narration. This is one movie where the soundtrack is an integral part of the story; it tells much more of the story (i think) tham the narration does. Easy to watch and rewatch and rewatch..."
4,It is what it is,I think these things are cool and they work. But thieves do know they are out there get some different kinds and spread them around and you might keep some fo your stuff in case of a break-in Good Luck!
3,Nice price for something to watch,I liked this movie. Good for starter who want something simple with Anime. Nice price and okay plot. The drawing is a little simple.
1,Beware of Durability!,"The watch looks great, HOWEVER beware of durability issues.First, on the bracelet the little pins that hold the bracelet together regular become loose or fall out and have to be replaced. In the first year I owned the watch I had to have it repaired three times for this problem, finally I asked for a brand new watch and the problem occurred all over again. It is not like I wore the watch doing construction work either, I am an office professional! Very frustrating.Also, the WHITE dots on the face of the timepiece, which have a substance in them to illuminate the face in darkness deteriorate over time and turn BLACK (within one year)! Again this happened to me with two separate watches.This watch will frustrate and disappoint both cosmetically and functionally. As a timepiece this watch quickly falls out of accurate time unless you constantly wind it tightly by hand. Beware!"
5,excellent item,this watch is even more gorgeous that it looks online. superb buy. the size is just perfect. and its exactly what is says online.
2,Love Never Dies,Andrew Lloyd Webber should have rested on the laurels of the Phantom. This sequell has ruined my all time favorite musical. To me the love story had been about Raoul & Christine and love conquers all. In this sequel it turns out that the Phantom really was nothing more than a Pedophile and a stalker. Christine had gotten pregnant by the Phantom then passed the child off as Raouls who had become a drunken gambler and had lost his fortune.Meg Ghiry meanwhile had prostituted herself to help the phantom get back on his feet. Overall a huge disappontment
1,horrible,"the actors were horrible, christine daee was ugly i have no clue where they found her. and the stage was small and the storyline was not good, especially christine dying at the end. i guess no part 3 huh? i am ashamed this is a sequel, what was webber thinking when he made this? i recommend not wasting your money like i did."
3,Not as good as the original,"Love never dies has beautiful costumes and dark, eerie and spellbinding sets. To me it was almost too dark and eerie at times. Every character was so dark and Emo. It truly actually made me depressed by watching it lol. It kinda reminded me of a dark, dark version of Moulin Rouge. Never the less, it's worth watching. Would I purchase it and watch it over And over? No."
4,Love Never Dies,"Excellent condition, good timing. Music was typically beautiful for a Lloyd Webber production, nice follow-up for Phantom of the Opera."
5,Stunning,"This is a must have for any DVD collection. I was actually at the performance when the filming was done. The sets are amazing, something new to see every time you look. Ben Lewis and Anna O'Bryne give memorable performances are The Phantom and Christine, and are well supported by Simon Gleeson, Sharon Millerchip and Maria Mercedes. The score is one the best Andrew Llyod webber has written and the vocal talents of the cast blend beautifully with it. My personal favorites are 'Til I hear you sing' and Beneath a moonless Sky"
1,"Buy the song, Burn the movie.","I HATED this movie. They took a beautiful story and turned it into UGLY. It almost totally ruined the 'Phantom of the Opera' for me. It was a bad ending for every character. Buy the song ""Love Never Dies"", but please don't buy this horrible movie."
1,"If you believe that ALW can do no wrong, you will love this","Very little makes sense in the plot. Just for starters, if Christine is ""the soprano of the century,"" then why is it that New York is the only place she can come to be paid to sing? And why did Raoul go from hero to zero? The recurring themes in the lyrics do not connect to any complexity of the human experience (""The heart can't be fooled, The heart is too wise."" really?). Perhaps I'd rather see Starlight Express again- at least then one could be amused by the roller skating."
3,Pointless,"It is inconceivable to me that Mr. Weber concocted this so called sequal. Frankly, with the enormous success of the first one, it is mind boggling. My guess is it is because that everything he has done since has been a flop;Aspects of Love, Sunset Boulevard, Whistle Down the Wind etc so I guess he felt this would be a sure thing. It just goes to prove ""You can fool people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time."" Nevertheless, I found myself spellbound by this piece on the second viewing, so who am I to judge? The DVD of Phantom at Royal Albert Hall is also superb."
4,Charming,Its a good story in itself yet not at the grandeur and scale and youthful innocence of the original Phantom of the Opera. The DVD is full of extra features and well worth the viewing for all Phantom fans.
2,Lightening doesn't strike twice.,"Gotta say, this was pretty horrid. Only one good song in the whole thing. Nice concept I guess. Only die hard Phantom fans would bother with this."
1,Disappointed,"The quality of the blue ray was excellent, but the movie itself was bad. This was big disappointment for Andrew Lloyd Weber. No outstanding music and plot was boring."
2,phantom + maury,"This is so awful it is family guy maury mash-up bad. It starts with this whiny kid they have when did they sleep together ? Wait isn't the year eighteen hundred women running around with guns and fornicating back then. I'm a huge ""Phan"" but my gosh this was a disgrace between all the little people dancing and the vocals were nearly dreadful what happened to the ballerinas? It was supposed to be romantic and forbidden love but it turned it into a Jerry springer episode. The only thing that made this movie worth it was the song ""beautiful"" and the cinematography was pretty. This was like a bad comedy almost like a spoof. The bathing beauty skit really ? turn it off somewhere around there. I bet Gaston leroux is flipping in his grave you know that guy who actually wrote the real book version ? Save your money and re-watch the first one."
5,great product,"Our new window world $2,000 patio sliding glass door did not come with a lock for the screen door. Fits well, is probably a universal screen door lock. Gets the job done."
5,You want this movie!,this is actually the 2nd movie in the series I believe. The other 3 are sold in a box set. I recommend getting them all and then watching them in order. Meiko is incredible. She is kind of like a dark version of Cool Hand Luke. She isn't the smartest but she is determined and she carries the role incredibly well. Terrific movie.
5,worth a look,"This is an amazing book. If you are familiar with Christopher Doyle's cinematography or his other photography books, then you'll like this. It focuses mostly on behind-the-scenes, artsy shots of the film sets he's worked on and the stars he's worked with, and he's written brief descriptions for each photo.But don't expect this to be a traditional photography tome. The binding requires one to carefully rip along perforated edges to reveal the contents of every other page, unless you choose to undo the stitching at the spine. Perhaps this is a way for Doyle to force the viewer to interact with the work ... not sure. Anyway, it's not quite as annoying as it sounds ... and part of his charm is the imperfect nature of his work.I would recommend this book, but then I bought it in Taiwan a few years back for about $40 US."
5,Ike Reilly at his BEST!!!!!,"If you don't have any Ike Reilly, buy this one. He is, in my humble opinion, a national treasure. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!"
5,exceptional,I have been looking for this movie for a couple of years. Great shape and I had a great time watching one of my favorite childhood movies. Thanks
2,"Good movie, strange closed caption","For some reason, this movie came to me as one with Korean closed captions, something I wasn't aware of when ordering it. It's great, except for the strange choice of having Jim the slave be a young boy instead of an adult. Walter Brennan is amazing as always."
2,I was not so impressed,"I expected more. I've seen a remake with Jody Foster: it actually repeats this older version but with better qualities of color, sound, etc....I could've easily managed without it.ThanksAlla"
5,"SLOAN AND HEATHER,WHAT A ROMANCE!!!!!!!!!","This is the first Nicole Jordan book I have ever read, and I am in the process of puchasing every book I can get my hands on by her. The story is very sensual and gripping and very sad at times. However, we know that in most romance books love prevails and guess what??? I won't give away the story... This romance is not what I would call ""deep"" but what the heck, I don't know alot of romance novels that are, isn't that why we read them??? Enjoy!"
5,revisting the Ragamuffin Gospel,"This is, without a doubt, the best book your gonna get for your buck with the exception of the Bible itself. Manning has made a book for the ages here. I first recommended this book two years ago. It is still my highest recommendation. I'm not joking about this...it is high time for you to get this book.We either don't know or sometimes forget just how much God loves us all. This book drives this point home in the most remarkable ways. If you want to know freedom, if you want to know love, look no further than these pages...Manning tells us where to get these things by introducing us to the only guy who can give them.Get this book."
3,"Good, but...",This edition was poorly bound. I bought and exchanged the book three times because the pages kept falling out. I have a feeling this is why the book is no longer in print. The artwork was amazing though.
1,Ragamuffin Gospel - Visual edition,"I ordered this item in error not realizing what the ""visual edition"" actually was (distracting and cluttered).. What I was looking for was the 'regular' print/text edition which in fact I subsequently ordered and received. I plan to return the volumes ordered by mistake..."
5,Practical Help for the 'Bedraggled',Manning has an honesty that makes the reader eager for each new page of anecdotes. He not only 'talks the talk' but 'walks the walk' of a highly succesful professional who has faced the demons of multiple addictions and the vilification of numerous 'good' folks. He describes the joy that God's mercy brings to the most blighted individual. God's mercy is not out of reach!
4,Great Military-Politico Sci Fi,The latest in the series which describes a world in which the US takes on the European Union in a war based on ecological theories. Its frighteningly close to reality.
4,Good military science fiction,"I found this novel to be a page turner and difficult to put down. It kept me up pretty late for that reason. The story is told well, written well and paced to be exciting. I am sorry not to see another book in the series ready for me to read."
3,Etienne Aigner Women's Woodwind Mule,"Looks different in the photo, I wasn't aware that the silver buckle across the top was so prominent. Also it is defintely not comfortable to go walking around, a reasonable shoe for wearing around the office."
3,Eagerly awaiting their next release...,"With K-12, Portland band Assisted Living offers a mix of tracks that really groove... hard. Check out ""Awakened"" (my personal favorite). My only reservation about this album it that the studio mix, in and of itself, doesn't really gel. (The drum sound is a little thin for my taste...) The music (in both conception and in execution) is top notch.As for me, I'm looking forward to the forthcoming CD, which should be out soon. These guys deserve to be known."
3,Commercial Law: Law I,"I was very pleased with the book. The cover was a bit worn on the hard back but the book was in good shape as far as all the pages. I received it in a very timely fashion and the price was very good. All and all, I am happy with the purchase."
2,Poor video and audio quality,"I purchased Sky Captain through Amazon and enjoyed the movie's video and audio quality thoroughly. Both were high and sharp. Very impressive. Assuming, for the same price, I would get exactly the same quality when I bought ""Ca$h"". I was robbed. Low quality video, and smaller frame video size; poor mp3 low-quality audio (low quality audio usually have less range of frequency spectrum playback, while with a hissy, noisy, offensive sizzles. Really unpleasant to the ears). Lame. I liked the movie, wish I could keep the movie but, get half the money back. it would only seem fair this way. Very disappointed."
3,Good Chronology,"I thought Mr. Burleson did a good job of compiling information from various sources and putting them in a coherent chronological order. I didn't notice very much new or revealing information, but found that he had researched this tragedy very thoroughly. I'd recommend reading KURSK DOWN for a better insight into our most recent naval tragedy. Considering the reasonable price, it's definitely worth buying. Pick it up now."
3,Ball Blue Book on Canning and Freezing,"This little soft back book is interesting but the volume I have is an older version. I am swapping it out for the 2001 edition as it also includes dehydration. That one, which I have read, is the one to get.DD"
2,I just really didn't like the heroine...,"My book reading buddy LOVED this book and I think this is probably the only book we haven't had an agreement on.Anyway, ""Henry"" drove me nuts!! While I am all for the un-ladylike heroine that becomes a lady, I just couldn't get into Henry's character...she was to overbearing and a bitch and very unlikable to me. I stopped reading the book when I kept finding myself wishing she would get the boot off the estate. I don't know, I didn't feel the chemistry and didn't understand how Dunford could keep Henry around when it was with-in his rights to send her packing...yes this is a romance novel, but I really wonder if I would have liked the story better if she had gotten the boot.Anyway, I'm a big Julia Quinn fan and looking forward to the next novel she will publish, but I can't recommend this book, especially since I couldn't finish it."
2,Sadly did not like,I am not a great reader of romances and the part about the mistress did not bother me. I just really didn't like Henry's character and found the book quite boring she was not a character I could come to care about. She didn't have any confidence and I think that's why I didn't appreciate her. I know that there arguments why she shouldn't have the confidence but Jane Eyre's life was much worse and she had confidence. Just did not enjoy the characters. But I really loved Splendid.
4,Lovely,"I really like Henry, there was an honesty about her that you don't see very often in romance novels at the moment. She really was honest in how she felt and when she was wrong, she knew it and admitted it. That is so refreshing.I held off reading this book for quite a while because I was reluctant to do the ""country bumpkin ward falls in love with guardian"" thing but it was more than that, their friendship is believable and you can see their closeness developing into something more. A very good read not too heavy."
4,balanced view,"I'm a serious foodie and locavore and it's important not to just ""swallow"" one side of any issue -- this book is credible and makes you stop and think."
1,A Published Academic Study that States the Obvious,This book produced no surprises. It is simply a report on a tedious academic study that produced very predictable results. The 100+ page book is summarized in one page where the author spits out the predictable results. I almost gave the book two stars based on the fact that it affirmed some assumptions my company is already making about collaborative technologies.
2,I couldn't even finish it.,"I assumed, based on how much I liked flyy Girl, that all of Omar Tyree's books would be thoroughly entertaining. I was wrong. This book was so...preachy. Almost like he was trying to convert all wayward confused women who make bad decisions about their life into emotionally strong women who can always see where they are going wrong, and can stop themselves from making mistakes, with this one book. I tried real hard to get through the whole book, but in the end I just couldn't do it. It just didn't speak to me. There are too many books in the world, to waste time reading a poorly written one. I don't know if I would want to chance reading any more of his books, although the premises sound mighty interesting."
5,Single Mom,"The novel Single Mom by Omar Tyree is a rather interesting book. I feel easily enticed into the lives of the characters in the story. I also feel as though I can relate to the situation of the main character, Denise. I believe this because a single mother rears me. I am glad that Omar Tyree decided to write a story based on the hardships of a single mother. Another thing that I admire about this book is the way the author describes the personalities and lifestyles of his characters throughout the entire book. Usually the author describes his characters at the beginning of the story only. In this novel, if you were to only read a segment you would not be capable of fully understanding the characters and their motivations. Though I have not yet completed all of Single Mom by Omar Tyree, I still feel that is an interesting book to read. I am enjoying it and I think that others will as well. In my opinion, I recommend that you go out and get it because it is very good."
5,"Truly exceptional, get this!","I'm a fan of discworld and I'm sure I would have enjoyed this book in any case. But Reaper Man is easily the most powerful work of the entire series. How a writer can be both hilarious and transcendant at the same time - and on the subject of Death - is astonishing. On reading and re-reading Reaper Man, I have reflected many times on Pratchett's moving philosophy of death but only after I finished laughing. Just buy it, you'll see what I mean."
5,The Grim Reaper is anything but grim here.,"I was introduced to Terry Pratchett's work in Edinburgh when a theatre group performed Hogfather during the Edinburgh festival. Despite freezing cold weather(it was performed outdoors) I was hooked for good. I returned to the states, bought Reaper Man, read it, and I LOVE IT!!!! I advise you though, do not read it in public, because you will surely be laughing out loud!!Kateri"
2,Truth to the Adage,"You get what you pay for. The clock costs less than $10 and is made in China, so..... it is light-weight and flimsy, but from the other side of the room, it looks cute. Regarding its accuracy in keeping time - so far so good, but we've only had it in use a week. The alarm is not at all alarming - if you are hard of hearing or need a loud noise to rouse you - this is not your wake up call."
2,You get what you pay for.,Clock is small. Keeps good time. The problems I do have with this clock is the alarm is not loud enough. The alarm hand is almost as big as the second hand so if your looking at it during the night (and that light is a joke) you can get confused. I would say don't waste your money. Get a better clock.
2,The show is better,"I love the show, but if you have seen it you have no further need to read the book. It was boring and very simply written."
5,GREAT ACTING!,"I just rented this movie last night, and I had very high expectations of it from the reviews I have been reading. And I must say that it lived up to all of the good things that have been said about it. The lead actor, Paul Frnaklin Dano, was incredible as was Brian Cox.This film is about a young teen who is best friends with a con-man, Gary (Billy Kay), and the two of them break into a pedophile's house and steal 2 guns. Then, the pedophile (Big John) goes after Howie, suprisingly though, the two of them become quite close. Soon, when Howie's (Dano)father is arrested by the F.B.I, Howie has no one to turn to except Big John.I thought this movie was very good and I definately reccomend it. Although, this film is not for everyone. Anyone who finds pedophelia or a depressing story too unbearable to watch, then you should not see this film."
2,A disappointment,"The Fall & Rise of Reginald Perrin: The Complete SeriesWhen I first watched this series back around 1980 or thereabouts, I thought it was great. Now I see how weak the third season is but, worst of all, this old masterpiece has been seriously edited for ""political correctness"". I'll donate the DVD set to my local library since there is no chance I'll waste time watching it again."
1,Sub_Par Product,"Of the four disks set, three worked great, but the fourth was damaged and would not play.Since this was a gift, this was not discovered until after the 30 day warranty, so no help from Amazon.The three disk that did play was just great. The series is one of a kind and wonderful.If you want to obtain this series go to BBC America and obtain a reliable copy."
5,WELL DONE,Another well done story by Julie Garwood. One of the best things I enjoy about Julie's work is her subtle humor. I found myself laughing out loud on many occasions. Good book.
1,The first and the last,"This is the one and only Julie Garwood book I have ever read and it was so bad I have never been tempted to try any more of her books. Unlikely plot, full of historical inaccuracies, anachronisms, lots of 'gotten's and wrong use of titles - Oh and endless gratuitous sex. Was not impressed."
1,Straight to the donation box,"I had a love/hate relationship with this novel. I gleefully cringed through the opening sequence of brain surgery (sans operating room). I enjoyed the descriptions of the maniacally brilliant killer. I even enjoyed the mix of sci fi and fantasy with the horror theme. However, this one eventually lost my interest by bringing in far too many unimportant elements. DARK MATTER just never comes through with a punch. It delivers gore to the max and has a potentially fiendish villain, but it fizzles before it really gets to the point. I was, needless to say, quite disappointed.One of the cover reviews for this book describes it as ""a character portrait of a copletely amoral serial killer to rival Thomas Harris's RED DRAGON..."" Do yourself a favor: read RED DRAGON instead; it's beautifully written and amazingly chilling."
5,"A sexy, cool, naughty tune","The kinda tune that will make you feel really sexy. AL are sexy, (especially Bobak) and this song is sooo naughty you'll won't be able to stop listening to it!"
2,"Silicone was nice, but not much else","This product looked like a much larger pan than I actually got. The space for adding batter is remarkably small. I like to bake normal-sized items, and this didn't even come close. Probably should have looked at the measurements more closely!"
5,Makin' The Cut,"What delights me is that all the songs from High School Musical one are included in this NDS game, and also the characters. The game is based on the songs and the characters and the story of High Schoo Musical. From Sharpay and Ryan performing Bop To The Top to the Woldcats' Getcha Head In The Game. players can follow their dance moves, listen to their songs, collect pictures of their favourite HSM stars and to join in the fun!"
5,FUN GAME!!,"This game is really fun to play!! I sarted to play it this afternoon and was hooked!! Its so addicting. You just want to keep going and to improve the grade you get every time so you can unlock mmore levels. I havend't learned all about the game yet, but I love it so far!!If you like High School Musical and/or High School Musical 2, then you will love this game!!!"
4,hero for our time,"""It is engorged with gossip, spiced with sex, and utterly obsessed with personality...fascinating to read...vivid images...leap from every page"" says the miami harold.This book i recently read for an english class non-fiction assisgnment. I have read many book's on John F. Kennedys years in office and before his term. this book is fascinating in every way. If you want a book that goes into detail about his life in politics,sex,family,royalty,and friends I reccomend this book to you. From Cape Cod as a child to hyannis port sailing trips. In this book there is some parts that go into details in his relationship with his father and two brothers.""theres facts that many people don't even know"" for example he was on crutches to the end of his life and jackie stayed at the white house after he died.If You want detail I recommend this book for you.KarlPinconning,MiPinconning High School"
2,quality,I purchased it to give to my grandmother and it wasn't in good enough condition to give as a gift.
5,Excellent Documentary on Manic-Depression and Drug Abuse,"As a fellow manic-depressive, I found Joe's obvious Bipolar I Disorder (self-confessed ""full blown mani[a]"") and use of hallucinogens as a drug of choice for coping with life's struggles very honest. I appreciate his sharing his experience, strength, and hope so honestly in such a public way. I wish him the best in his reluctantly chosen profession in the future.This is also a great documentary for friends and family of the manic-depressive, who can be challenging to understand, live with, and love. I am using the documentary to cope with a recent 1.5 month hospitalization for a medication adjustment. Loved ones can see that hospitalization can be either a blessing or a nightmare, depending on a totality of the circumstances.Thanks Joe! Take care bro,Doughman"
5,Great pedals! love them,"I've gone through 4 sets of pedals on my bicycle, and these are the only ones that have lasted. I do off-road, but mostly street riding. They aren't incredibly grippy for mntn riding, but do just fine on the street. It's nice that you can ride them bare-foot or with flip-flops and not worry about puncturing your footwear...or feet."
1,YUCK!!!,"disgusting shoes, definitely look like faux leather. i never even put them on my feet, so i wouldn't know if they are comfortable. don't get these mixed up with the sensational leather boots by Chinese laundry. those are beautiful boots. these are sickening. i just got them today, and I'm returning them later this after noon. YUCK!!! and amazon.com you should be ashamed of yourselves. those boots you sent me were defective. the material was scraped of in various places. they looked like they had been melted too."
3,Poor Quality Guitar,"This toy is a piece of junk. The other reviewer's remark about the sounds is right on target. They are muffled and hard to hear, and do not sound authentic. When the guitar is wiggling, the mechanism is so loud you can barely hear anything else. The toy is rather flimsy and will not stay upright when it is wiggling. My son LOVES the Wiggles. However, he really was not interested in this crummy toy after a week or so. Buyer beware!"
2,Does not stand well,My little boy loves it however it does not stand on it's own to well. Unless it is on an extremely flat surface! He loves eo dance with it but once it fall over he is not to interested.
1,I am a carebear fanatic BUT...,"...I will have to shoot myself if I am forced to watch this again. The animations are very annoying, the court jesterish feel is very annoying and the portrayal of Funshine Bear (my favorite) as a pre-teenaged boy jokester is NOT my idea of what carebears is about. I was NOT impressed with this movie!"
1,Way too creepy for a kids' movie,"My little girl is a big Care Bear fan, so when I found this movie I thought it would be perfect for her. It's our first Care Bear movie experience. Wrong! Within about 10 minutes into the movie, she was crying and afraid as Funshine is wisked away in a really scary, not-fun rollar coaster, a prisoner on his way to Joke-A-Lot. Joke-A-Lot itself is peopled with a nightmarish hoard of laughing, unthinking scary critters more appropriate to HBO's Carnival rather than an ostensibly ideal world for Care Bears. It's hard to imagine who the audience for this movie is. It's got a very dark, moody atmosphere."
1,Totally Bizarre..,"Okay, my girls, 2 and 4 discovered the Care Bears recently with the Oopsy Does It video. They *loved* it. Sat completely silent through the whole movie just glued to the screen. Wow. They didn't seem as interested in the tv series, so when I found this movie, another with computer-generated Care Bears, I thought it would be a hit. Wrong. This movie is bizarre. Bizarre. It is a little scary, as someone else mentioned. Not at all light, happy and funny like Oopsy Does It. This was darker, eviler. Like this episode was directed by Tim Burton or something. Just weird."
4,an excellent but slow paced film.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.In this film, the only movie that both Ingrid and Ingmar Bergman (no relation) were both involved in. In this film a woman visits her daughter at her home and attempts to reconcile with her.This film is definately not one thatmost people would find interesting and is almost like a soap opera.The DVD has a theatrical trailer and audio commentary by Peter Cowie."
3,Straight to the bottle..,"If you are contemplating suicide but can't summon enough angst to be decisive, watch ""Autumn Sonata"", Ingrid Bergman's last film, and only collaboration with Ingmar. The dialogue and acting are terrific and very, well, real, but I doubt I'll ever recover my former sense of humor, since apparently:1. Life is a steaming pile of excrement.2.Relationships are tenuous and scarring,and finally3.Nobody really loves anyone.Oh well, even bad IB is better than other stuff. So, open up your best bottle of red wine, lock up the razor blades and enjoy 8)."
5,Great for emergencies.,"Had just such an emergency the other day, stuck in the middle of a large parking area and no restroom in sight. Easy to use, no mess, these things can really save the day in a pinch."
4,Past and present collide in Seattle-area mystery story,"When Tadeo Kurobashi, a respectable Japanese-American businessman, appears in these pages, he is already a corpse. However, the reader gradually learns more about him from the perspective of his loyal friends, sworn enemy, reclusive and mysterious wife, and estranged daughter. Did he commit suicide (hara-kiri) because of impending bankruptcy or was he murdered? Seattle police detective J.P. Beaumont undertakes to find out and to solve intertwining mysteries as well. The story ranges geographically from Seattle to Spokane with a bit of Chicago Mafia mixed in. The past enters in with snippets about occupied Japan after World War II and the detention camps for Japanese-Americans during the war. All-in-all, an engrossing mystery with believable characters. Think I'll try other mysteries by this author and about the J.P. Beaumont character."
1,Added to collection,If it is a J.P. Beaumont book it is always great. My husband is health challenged and reads a lot. And he likes to read books in the order written. Some of the Beaumont books were written some time ago and cannot be obtained other than online. I can always count on Amazon to provide those books or direct me to another dealer.
4,"It was good, but I wish Krista Allen had a larger part","I though this movie was very good considering the budget they had to work with. It was fast pace, lots of blood, and funny. I bought the movie because I love Krista Allen, and was a little disappointed because she did not have a leading role in it. I give it 4 stars because I wish they had told us where the monsters came from."
4,Frantic Feast For Gore Hounds,"Feast has something to offend everyone, gore, gore, gore, oh and more gore.As well as breaking standard horror movie rules so flippantly it looks like the actors were put into the mix and had all this thrown at them.A lot of people didn't take to this film because of the camera style (jumping here, there and everywhere) but I thought it gave the film a realistic feel and made it more exciting.I also felt a touch of From Dusk Til Dawn here too with people being trapped in a bar setting.Feast is not the greatest horror film you'll ever see, it is however a fun ride for those who can take it."
2,"Fun, but nothing more","I have to say I'm suprised by the amount of 5 star reviews. That is actually what made me check it out in the first place. Unfotrunately I have to disagree with all the praise. For the most part this was just a gorefest which had so much potential and fell way short.The idea of the movie was great. I loved the whole concept of all these people being trapped while these man eating creatures lurk outside doing anything to get in and feed. The only problem was it was made a bit too comical. I was hoping for more of a scare then a laugh. Well except for the little creature that humped everything, that was well worth it. As for the creatures themselves they were really cool looking, once they were finally revealed in the last 15 mins. I wish we would have had more time to see them without their coverups on.Overall I would have to say this was wasn't nearly as good as I expected. It did have it's moments but just wasn't enough."
2,it`s krista allen but no from dusk till down,"ridicolous creatureattaks a bar full of strange characters.it starts out pretty good whith the introductions of the characters but goes own hill fast when it bings nothing new just more gore.Krista allen however is always great to look at and she does not dissapoint in feast eighter,if only there was more of her to look at,that would have helped the movie a lot.ps does any one else think baltazar ghetty is a illigitamate son of martin sheen.Because he looks like two drops of water like charlie sheenin everything he does."
3,Danny Greene:The Rise & Fall of the Irishman.,"Danny Greene:The Rise & Fall of the Irishman-Saw it on Netflix Instant,Good movie,a bit graphic with Actual Period Crime Scene photos,fingers,body parts blown off.I had never heard of the guy personally,But apparently was tough and was also an Informant,The Cleveland Italians did not like him and as usual the two groups Irish and Italian did not get along(some parts of the country they do).I am not sure if it is glorifying The Man or what was the goal of the film,but informative it was,Like they say,""Live by the Sword,Die by The Sword."""
5,Great group of stories.,"I bought this book for the story by Sunny, and that story alone wad worth the price of the book,to me. So the other stories, were enjoyable, that just made it a bonus. I reccomend this to anyone that is reading the series by Sunny. It will fill in a small part that I think will help when her next book comes out soon."
3,No Pain by 2pac in this CD and it most R&B,There are some good song on Above The Rim be what i was looking for that they forgot to put in is the pain song for 2pac what is a Very Very good song by 2pac the Cd ok for a 3 there is alot of old school R&B. you my like be it really didn't do it for me.
4,Homer's Odyssey,"Cheesy title, but I couldn't think of anything else.In my defense, this watch does have a timeless look, yet at the same time is very modern -- futuristic even.The cost of this timepeice is a deal when one factors in the quality and durabilty. I've had it for some time now and not a scratch can be seen, and he clasp mechanism works like new. I get comments on it in social settings all the time. This one is a keeper!"
2,Not as pictured,"This is pictured as if the ice wrap goes half way up the shin, not so it stops right above the ankle. Not happy in the least... The main reason we order this is because it is pictured so as if it is the ankle and the lower leg."
3,CPM Knee Wraap,"I purchased this because I have had knee replacement surgery and I wanted something to use to help with swelling in my knee. As long as you are sitting around with your leg proped up it is fine, but if you get up to walk around it slips down the leg."
3,good,lack the razzamataze of the musical but it was interestingIt is always interesting to me how they adapt books for movies
5,Perfect!,I absolutely love this shelf. It is tall and thin and exactly the color it looks online. It was really easy to put together and is really sturdy!
2,Very good read!,I was pleasantly suprised with this book. Ms. James really brought the aspect of spiritual warfare to light in a very personal way! The characters were very realistic and I found myself wanting to know more about them. I found it to be like a less frightening (but no less intriguing!) Peretti plot.
5,Exploring the stratification process,"Collaboratively compiled and edited by Cedric Herring (Professor of Sociology and Public Policy, University of Illinois - Chicago), Verna M. Keith (Chair of the Department of Sociology, Arizona State University), and Hayward Derrick Horton (Associate Professor of Sociology, Albany University-SUNY), Skin/Deep: How Race And Complexion Matter In The ""Color-Blind"" Era is a collection of informative and informative essays concerning the very real and entangled issues of race, judgement, and the question of why skin color remains a determining factor of economic success and quality of life in America today. Exploring the stratification process, cause and effect chains, emerging issues such as biracialism and color-blind racism and a great deal more, Skin/Deep is a highly recommended contribution to Contemporary Social Issues reading lists and offers a wealth of persuasively argued and deftly presented viewpoints."
2,Not as strong as it looks,"I bought this because I've read that the aluminum ones break, and the enameled ones have the finish flake off. I bought a small aluminum one in a liquor store for a few dollars, and although it discolored because I made the mistake of putting it in the dishwasher, it never broke, and still works well but is only big enough for small limes. While this Norpro Stainless-Steel Citrus Juice Press is pricey, it looked like the best of all possible worlds, able to handle lemons as well as limes. It's nice looking, hefty, well made, easy to clean, works very well initially.BUT the solid handles bend! After they bend, the handles touch before all the juice is squeezed out.Not what I expected for the price. Buy something different for less."
1,Kumquats preferred,"Seems very sturdy but it is so very small that local market valancias must be quartered for effective use! If time, or repetative motion is a concern this is not a good choice. But if you want to squeeze tiny ,tiny fruits for a teeny tiny sip, this will do the job."
3,"Looks Good, Hard to Squeeze!","Only mediocre juice, especially from thick-skinned lemons. Hard for nerve-damaged hands to grip tightly and squeeze. Hard to get juice from Key limes, and forget about regular-sized oranges. Only juicer to squirt me with juice! Looks like it'll last, however. Performs adequately and the finish seems pretty durable."
1,Broke after 3 Weeks,I don't know why everyone is so enamored with these things. The pin fell out after 3 weeks of use. Looks like several other people have had the same problem. How cheap can you get?I purchased a lime squeezers 15+ years ago from Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco. (they have a great tequila bar by the way). The thing is made out of some sketchy metal and looks terrible after 15 years of running it through the dishwasher. But at least it didn't break!
2,Emerald Nutcase,"These nuts were of high quality packaged in small containers. The price, however, was WAY above retail prices in stores. I am also disappointed that the only way we could get them was to subscribe to an ""every 6 months"" subscription. I hope to cancel that subcription. Charles Bunk"
1,Hasn't improved much...,"This book was barely worth the $3 it originally cost as a cheap mass paperback 20 years ago. It hasn't improved. If you REALLY want to know what the RoundTable, the CFR, the Trilateralists, etc. are ""conspiring"" to do, go to the NYC phone book, or their Web sites <!> and ASK them. Both the CFR and TriLateral commission will be happy to send you ALL of their writings, journals, white papers and proposals for a very reasonable fee. Here's a clue...if the information is so easliy obtainable that a hack like Gary Allen (or any one of dozens of other authors) can get it....there isn't much of a conspiracy!"
5,A must read!,"This book is a fantastic tool for those seeking the truth in the behind the scenes dealings of the elitist ultra-rich, who seek to control the world. Exposing the complete agenda of the few corrupt power grabbers, this book is a refreshing piece of writing that took place quite some time ago. It is amazing that the author had such a complete understanding of the inner-workings of foreign policy and finance that have shaped the landscape all along, leading to the mess that our country is now in.Although the reading can be a bit difficult to follow at a pretty high level of reading ease, the message gets across in a very chilling fashion.This book is a must-read for anyone who plans on saying no to the enemies of our nation in the upcoming turmoil."
3,Interesting,"The fall of communism seems to have ruined some of the theories in this book, but I liked the book because it did point to a One World Government conspiracy which does exist. Who was the first President to promote the ""New World Order""?? Answer: George Bush (former member of CFR). His name appears in an older CFR membership roster. Clinton was a student and admirer of Prof. Quigley mentioned in this book. Also the info on the Federal Reserve is very interesting. I was shocked to learn in college that no branch of U.S. gov'nt, including Congress, can audit the Federal Reserve under the guise for need of ""independence"", thus confirming the power of this very powerful, unelected, undemocratic agency."
4,Conspiracy exists.,"This book was enlightening to the extent that America's current crisis began many years ago, prior to 1970. I found it interesting how the Nixon administration was controlled by powerful Democrats and the way weapon components were labeled as ""non-strategic"" items. By labeling weapon components this way they could be shipped/exported to enemy nations for assembly and used against our soldiers during the Vietnam war. I also found it interesting that the names in the news today have successfully escalated their agenda toward a New World Order. This book stops where Naomi Klein's, 'Shock Doctrine' begins.The most disappointing chapter is the last. It ends with a warning and 'call to action' by the American people. As evident today, no action was taken."
2,A Primer for the Gullible,"I first read Gary Allen's book in 1980 and believed every word of it. Over the next few years I gradually came to realize that the book lacks one critical ingredient: historical evidence.When discussing groups like the Council on Foreign Relations, the Round Table, and the Institute of Pacific Relations, Allen falls back on the venerable Carroll Quigley as his source for facts. Unfortunately, Quigley's own book, Tragedy and Hope, lacks even one footnote of corroborating evidence!Readers who want to know about the Round Table and the CFR are well-advised to try a different approach -- do your own research. After having read Allen's book more than 18 years ago, I am still researching these groups and have yet to come to a final conclusion. Nothing is as simple as what any one book will tell you, and you may be surprised at what you find."
3,Interesting take on Communisim,"Very interesting for it's time, a time when communism was a big threat to the western world. Gives some great reasons why things run as they do. Like why would the international bankers of europe finance its own eventual demise. Shows that communism like all other political movements are ultimately just con games for the powers that be to keep power over the vast hordes of human chattle."
5,Fascinating!,"I never realized that diplomatic history could be so interesting! Especially in the 19th century! Goldberg tells the story of the Baltimore Affair in a gripping, electrifying way that seeks the real truth at its roots. You will never view America's purpose in the world the same way again after reading this book."
2,A Missed opportunity,"House of the Wolfman, a flashback to those classic horror films of the 30's and 40's. Filmed in glorious Black & White, the opening title sequence screams ""Old school"" monster movie. However the rest of the film is very slow, the acting is ""stagey"" at best, the plot very weak. The movie drips with great atmosphere and music. The Frankenstein Monster and Wolfman make-up are top notch, only we have to wait until the last 10 min to see them??!! The old lady in the attic, the ""nosferatu"" vampire brides all offer some errie chills! There is so much more that this film could have been. Dracula, The Wolfman and Frankenstein's monster...how could this combination be bad? Unfortunately, this movie will show you....as I said in the tile of this review...a missed opportunity indeed!"
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"After using this product for about 4 weeks, there was no more bowel movement. I never experienced any weight loss after continuing to use this product for a total of 8 weeks. New Body doesn't offer any guarantee for any of their products, in fact, once you have spent your money you do not have any recourse if you are not satisfied. All of my clients experienced the same results. ""Money Waisted"" I do not recommend anyone to purchase their products SCAM."
4,Nice solid watch,"It's a nice solid watch, runs wells. I like the fact it's self winding ( I thought that was a better solution than batteries). I wish it had a cover and the chain was heavier but overall, I'm very happy."
3,"A nice desk-side companion, but so is a cat","Of course, if you want to learn a program, you have to use it. This book is a nice compendium to draw from for somewhat savy beginners, but it can be, like all books of its ilk, stale and utterly uninteresting to read. I find I use it the most when I stumble across a problem I have while using 3d Studio, and I need a quick explanation of a function or such, but otherwise I didn't find it too helpful when I was first struggling with the program itself. I guess I just lost interest when I sat down at my computer to to read/use it, but perhaps it's because I'm a hateful man."
2,Not user friendly,"3d studio max 2 Fundamentals by New Riders is hard to follow for beginners. This book gives many good recommendations on some core ideas of creating 3D objects, scenes and etc, but it does not show detail procedures of applying the recommended effects. However, this book has a very attractive cover. :-D"
1,Disturbing,"Laura Harring is Stacey, who lives in Africa with her husband Mark (played by John Hannah).She looses him in an accident then finds she is pregnant.When she has the baby there is a blurred line whether the baby boy is possessed by her dead husband or not.And here's where it gets disturbing.*Spoliers*She breast feeds the baby who sucks so hard it draws blood. But the doctor's can't find teeth when they examine the baby.She holds it in the shower and the baby plays with her nipple and she has visions of making love under the shower with her dead husband and then notices her baby son is overly excited.That's the info, it's up to you if you want to see that sort of thing"
4,it is always nice to be invited...,"The subtitle for this book is ""an Invitation to Philosophical Theology"" and that is what Mr. Miller provides: an approachable orientation to the frequently confusing jumble of philosophies surrounding theology.Mr. Miller lays out the popular arguments in laymanfs terms, offers a few facts about who did the pioneering work and then moves on to some of the objections surrounding each theory.The writing is lucid and clear: very easy to understand. The orientation is decidedly Christian. However, Mr. Miller has, I think, done an excellent job of avoiding Christian dogma and chosen instead an approach that is logical and objective.If you are a person who is interested in the question gDoes God exist?h or if you are a Christian who is looking for objective thinking about God or if you are just wanting to drop names like Kant, Descartes and Kierkegaard into everyday conversation, then this is the book for you."
5,It worked!,"I had tried the tests with the two lines and could never tell when it was time to ""rock and roll"". This test is so easy to read that you are left with no doubt as to when your best days to conceive are. And - best of all - the first mth we used this we got pregnant!"
4,A Sentimental Novel!,"This was my first novel by Ms. Berg & I found it to be pretty good.It certainly wasn't the type of a novel that you couldn't put down but it was very sentimental & brought on tears. It was once called ""the love story of the year"" & in a way I agree because it was out of the ordinary--the characters husband was in a coma after they had had 2 children & a majority of the book was her describing the little things he did that made him so special to her & her memories of them together.That made it romantic & touching & not like some where guy meets girl & they have sex that first night! I did enjoy it & would say it was a good choice to read ."
4,Engaging Read,"This novel draws you in and keeps you engaged. This was my first Elizabeth Berg novel and I went right back for more and am now reading Joy School! Berg's writing is a glimpse into real people's lives and thoughts. It made me remember we all have issues, thoughts and dreams that seem so unique, but in reality, are shared by many others. This book is down to earth and i recommend it."
4,"Give up if you have to, but please don't.","Lainey's husband is in a coma. It was a stupid accidentand everyone laughs and she would too if he wasn't in acoma. The novel is so real you can feel the slight brush of heat from the characters sitting next to you. You could count their eyelashes if you wanted too, but you're too busy listening. She doesn't give up but she's not an inaccessible pillar of strength. Her strength is of the everyday. We all have it, and Berg reminds us that it's there."
2,Eeegads...,"Skip this one and read Berg's other books. This is a weepy, predicatable story that stretches out for far too long."
3,"nice, but smell stayed on","I ordered these pillows regardless of the other reviews stating that they had a smell that did last. I tried to put them in the dryer with fabrise and they still hung on to the smell or the plastic bag they arrived in, for several days. Finally, after a few days of treatments, these pillows were better. They were comfortable enough and would buy them again, without the smelly packaging."
4,Soft but not as fluffy as expected,"These goose down pillows are very comfortable to sleep on. They aren't as fluffy as I had expected them to be, but surprisingly provide a good night of rest.If you like your pillows very firm and filled to capacity, then this is not the pillow for you.If you like a soft thinner pillow then I think that you will enjoy this pillow."
1,Bad... Bad... Bad....,"Pillow is so thin, do not support my neck! On the picture it looks thick and fluffy but actually it's not. Play around with it for few seconds and decided to return it."
3,If you love a flat pillow...,"It's kind of okay if you fluff it up, but before long, it gets as flat as a pancake. I usually sleep on my stomache, so prefer flatter pillows. But this one's a little TOO flat for me."
4,very nice,I am very happy with this bike. I think it was well worth the money. very durable and rides like a dream. Comfortable seat and good hardware.
5,KitchenAid KPCA pasta cutter companion set attachment,The attachments great but I wish it also came with pasta rolling attachment that I didn't know I needed to have first to make the pasta before the cutter attachment units can be put to use.
4,MAKING PASTA IS EASY,"This is a great item and really makes pasta making a breeze. Cleaning the product is relatively easy, no immersion in water so you need a little brush or tool, which for the price of the item should be included. The thin(angel hair) pasta is a good size, but the wider noodle is much wider than fettucini. It was very good but not like fettucini. This attachment works with the pasta roller. The adjustments on the roller determine the thickness of your pasta. I would recommend this product and have used it several times."
5,Honoring Vance Havner,"This book has been a Godsend in difficult times. We do not have the ""Take it like it is"" kind of preaching in this day and age. Vance Havner was like Paul in the New Testament. Not out to make a name for himself, but to preach Jesus Christ and him crucified for out sakes. You just can't say anything in higher praise."
2,Not for those interested in crypto history,"Having high expectations for Station X, I was disappointed with the lack of historical analysis and the absence of decent discussion of Blechley Park. The book is a series of anecdotes that are often irrelevant or historically inaccurate.Upon fuller review of the book, it is acutely apparent that this text has more in common with a ""pop tv show"" than actual information about an interesting chapter in cryptography and cryptoanalysis. Overall rating is poor.Better books:Cryptonomicon The Code Book"
2,Hopeful Product is Better on Reorder!,"My sister put the Apron in the tote and added a few items and the front of the tote popped out and cracked. I hope this was just an isolated issue with the Educational Insights Teacher Tote-All. I plan to reorder for my sister. This product should be able to hold many items. If the next one doesn't meet our standards, I will return it and the Apron for a full refund!"
5,Tell My Horse,"Vital, energizing and most of all factual. No Hollywood metaphors here. This is the real earth-affirming belief and one that can have beneficent effects on those who really research and practice it. A well-written blessing."
4,CARVER ROCKS!,"While the plot for Carver might not be terribly original, I must say that this little gem surprised the hell out of me. It's incredibly well shot and generates a true sense of suspense and dread from beginning to end. The acting? Again, it surprised the hell out of me in a very good way. All performances were spot-on which is usally not this case in a low budget slasher film. In addition, the backwoods locations were just awesome and really added to the appeal. Crumbling outhouses, barns and even the woods themselves are used very smartly and effectively. The effects were definitely gruesome and well done. Don't believe the other review here that says this movie is only about the gore because it isn't. Any self-respecting horror fan should check this sucker out. And for the record, no, I am not the writer/director of this film nor do I know anyone associated with this film."
4,Teletubbies play set,"This set is very sweet and very cute. The parts are all very sturdy and very colorful. I recommend this toy, but you need to keep in mind that the figures have a very tight fit with the seats and the scooter. An upside? They fit perfectly with the Fisher Price ""Little People"" accessories, a secret we happily discovered. My toddler loves the set, goes around the house with one or two teletubbies in hand. With the added fun of combining Little People sets with this one, the play adventures are endless, making the toy very versitile."
4,What a treat!,"Great music. Interesting pianist. Spectacular conductor. Vibrant instrumentalists. - What a treat for the eyes too: the wonderful camera work makes this more absorbing to look at than the most breath-taking adventure... It's a pity we don't have more of this! What about Tchaikowsky's 4th and 6th Symphonies? What about so many other great works? - When you consider the millions of dollars that go into the recording of tons and tons of the ugliest and most uncivilized kind of trash these days (people have the nerve to call it music), and when you compare that with the extremely few DVDs that exist featuring good music (just look at the list, and you'll see), it makes you wonder whether we're not headed towards a new age of barbarism. We will still have the kind of great music that's on this DVD, but who's going to be there to listen to it? And if there's nobody to listen, then who's going to pay to have it recorded?"
3,"Great concerto, so-so recording.","I have owned this DVD since it came out and am still disappointed with it. While it's great to have this concerto on DVD, the performance of it is quite poor. The camera work and the DVD itself is quite good, giving good shots of the performer's hands. Still, he makes SEVERAL noticable mistakes in his performance. I couldn't imagine him getting much of an ovation at a major symphony hall. The performance of the symphony, though, is quite good. I'd recommend it. Overall, it's a DVD worth having, but not worth getting giddy over."
3,"Good, but pricey","I was generally pleased with the case, with a few exceptions. First, as others had mentioned, the zipper tab came off because the gap opened up. I fixed that by reassembling and putting a drop of epoxy on each zipper gap. I really didn't like the looks of the pocket side of the case showing a lot of white on an otherwise beautiful black case. It resembles someone wearing a black suit with their shirt tail hanging out. Why they did that is beyond me. That said it is well made and does a good job of protecting the computer, however it is very tight on putting my MacBook Pro 15 into it. Everything considered I probably wouldn't have bought it if I was aware of these problems. I think it was too expense for what I got."
3,Good continuation,"This second book in the Lily Bard/Shakespeare series was nicely written and entertaining. Ms. Harris did a terrific job weaving the plot and introducing Jack Leeds. This story brings together the rather sick thoughts hidden behind the gentile Southern manner of a few of the Shakespeare mighty. My my, what you don't know."
1,Bad acting + Horrible Special effects = absolute junk,"There are bad sequels and then there is this piece of junk. Horrible actors, horrible acting, a pathetic storyline and there you have Lake Placid 2. I have seen several sequels to various movies and this has to be one of the top drop offs I have even seen from an original. Don't waste your time with this piece of junk, instead, go get a root canal."
1,More painful to watch than the crocodile bites.,"I am 31 years old and have seen thousands of movies. This movie has got to be in my top three when it comes to the worst acting and storyline ever. The special effects were horrible and the super fast land crocs were utterly ridiculous. However, I am just mesmerized by how god awful the acting was. Seriously, I have seen ""B"" movies that were supposed to be corny with better acting. I am now wondering if this movie is supposed to be some bad acting joke and it hasn't been announced yet? Please tell me this movie was a joke...please."
2,Not a keeper...,The characterization is extremely limted. The writing is elementary. The sex is more along the lines of a Hustler confessional letter. Not erotic at all. A bad rewrite of East of Eden. If you must by it save a load of money and buy the electronic format.
2,Good but not great,"I was surprisingly impressed by this book.It's enticingly fantastical, you do have to suspend your disbelief for this one. Kris is an anthropology lecturer, who finds herself plagued by businessman Jack McKenna, who unfortunately happens to be one of the department's biggest donors.Kris longs to be dominated by a man, and to that end, she applies to work at an exclusive island resort, where she will cater to the sexual whims of very rich men who prefer submissive women.When she arrives there, she is offered as a prize in some bizarre, x-rated carnival games. One man keeps bidding on her- shocker- it's Jack McKenna.This was pretty predictable, I hated the predictable, boring, HEA ending. There was little characterisation, but I think the sex (which is pretty vanilla) saves the day, a little.Good, but not great, at all."
3,Great if you like polka!,"I am a bit disappointed in this album. The music is well performed, but it is mostly acordion music and sounds like polka. I was hoping for more ""traditional"" sounding music. Oh, well, the melodies are traditional at least."
5,Hawmps movie,Response to my purchase was very prompt. The condition of the items was excellent. We continue to be impressed with the professionalism shown by AmazonDon Hatfield
1,full of errors,This book is full of errors and half finished stories. The pictures are nice. If you are interested in the history of underground railways there are much better books to find.
2,Super socket??,"Did not work for my application. They didn't even try to work, the socket immediatly spun on the bolt head. They may work else where but I was not impressed."
1,Not Impressed.,"I just got back from 3 weeks at camp for Pennsylvania's bear and deer season. While at camp, I had the opportunity to read several books that were in the camp ""library"". This is one of 3 Len McDougal books I read during my stay. I was disappointed in this book as I feel the author was not all that isolated and in fact had way to many modern tools and conveniences at his disposal. Being able to drive into town at will was just too much. I don't think the early homsteaders had that choice. Modern firearm, tools, and other top of the line supplies made his ""adventure"" so much more pleasant that it was for those who had to do it for real. Had he stuck to the tools and hardships of others before him then I might have been impressed.One thing I noticed is someone mentioned in the book actually has a review here too, in fact a number of reviews of Lens books. Further research reveals that this person is Len McDougal's business partner. It makes me suspect of her glowing reviews of his books."
1,"do not buy, keep your $$$$$$","I bought this doll for as a xmas gift for my daughter, it's performnce compared to baby annabelle and rock a bye chou chou was negative -1, we tried several ways to get her to kick her legs (no luck), you can barely hear her cries, so she was returned the next day. We decided to just keep the other two, since they perform sooooo much better. I think the doll is overpriced."
3,Not bad for $4.99 in Blu-ray....,"What can I say, other than, when building your Blu-Ray Library, how can you go wrong for $4.99? Decent flick....."
4,"decent product, but cheaper at your local home depot",I should have done a little more research but have found good buys on amazon so I went with this. Home depot has these for under $7 :( Product works just fine tho
2,For The Era A Decent Fluff Piece,"John Nugent, of Santa Monica, wrote this bio for Mickey Cohen. It is fascinating in many respects and in others sorely lacking. There is no discussion of drugs or prostitution. Who would admit to that? Marilyn Monroe, for example, is never mentioned. Also odd, the entire book is lacking for CIA or FBI references and stories, something that played a great role in Cohen's life. However, at the time it was written, it followed the pattern of mob bios with one exception - Mickey Cohen was behind its publication, something unusual for a mob boss, almost unheard of and criticized by his cronies around the world. Still, it is often referenced as one of the only books available that pretend to show Cohen's voice, excepting Hollywood's Celebrity Gangster, The Incredible Life and Times of Mickey Cohen, by Brad Lewis, a newer take published in 2008."
4,His own words,"If you've been following the buzz about ""Gangster Squad"" and want to get more involved in the story line, Cohen's autobiography will do that. He pulls no punches. He basically admits, in his own salty language, to running the L.A. rackets and wreaking a lot of havoc on polite society. I enjoyed the book, which was well-used when I bought it. I would give it a fifth star if it were re-published with some update material on what happened to the mob after Cohen died."
4,Almost Perfect!,"Personally speaking, most of my favorite BB songs are included on this extraordinary compilation. It's a nice package to add to your CD collection if you're a Beach Boys fan. Some of their best work is included here. Although, I would have left off 409, Why Do Fools Fall In Love, Then I Kissed Her and California Dreamin' and replaced them with Darlin', Heroes & Villains, I Can Hear Music and the stereo version of Good Vibrations. For me, that would have been the perfect Beach Boys CD. However, this one comes pretty close. Close your eyes, turn it up and let the lush, layered harmonies take you back to a summer past. These guys were arguably the second most important pop music band in history, but sadly enough were and always will be in the Beatles' shadow."
3,Pretty heavy going,"I read this book because it won a Pulitzer Prize, and because I so greatly enjoyed the biographies of Keats by Aileen Ward and by Robert Gittings. But I found much of this book tough going. The study of some of the longer poems simply did not interest me. But the account of Keats' last year is very well-done and absorbing."
5,"If you like crime fiction and can find a copy, read it","I've now read all but one of Pelecanos' books and, while I wouldn't rank Shoedog as even one of the top five, I still rate it a five star book. The author has so many tools to work with that he can produce a terrific book even if he's not hitting it on all cylinders. I thought this book was a little short, which limited the character and story development a bit. And, several of the heist characters were also not as interesting as many others I've encountered in this author's books.Having stated my criticism, I'll have to say I loved reading the book anyway. Randolph, the Shoedog character, was superb. The planning and execution of the robberies was gripping. The Washington, D.C. and music references were characteristically well done. The story had enough twists and turns and the ending was not that predictable. If you like crime fiction and can find a copy (it's kind of scarce), I think you should read it."
2,just please rob the liquor stores,My first Pelecanos novel and won't be my last because I've heard such good things. But this stand alone heist novel is overlong. There is a great 100 page story in this book but the plot is dragged out to 300 pages with too many points of view and too many back stories for minor characters. You could skip the first 80 pages without missing much.The action sequences are riveting and well written but don't begin until chapter 20.
1,Poor Quality,"These PPA 1066 PCI to USB adapter's are of the poorest quality you can imagine. As soon as I inserted the card, my video became garbled. This was a Dell 690 workstation that I tried the card in. The video card is a Nvidia Quatro FX 4500. As soon as I removed the PPA card the video returned to normal. Being an engineer, I examined the card in detail, and found it had no 1/2 amp fuses on the USB ports as required by the USB standards. It did not have buss buffers for the PCI slot, so it did not meet PCI specifications either. I would never by products from PPA again. I tossed these 2 PPA cards into the garbage, and replaced them with an IOGEAR Model GIC251U. This card works great, and is made to USB standards."
4,very good,I can only agree with the other reviews. John B. (Visions & Catalyst) combines great sounds to dream with a rocking MC'ing which just makes you go mad. John B. JUSTICE !!!
4,"good, but not the best","I bought this CD along with IN A SILENT WAY, and KIND OF BLUE. I felt this was the best of the 3 CD's I bought. However, I personally don't think it is all that great. I also have AMANDLA by Miles and that is my favorite CD by him. Maybe I am not a jazz purest or something, but to me that CD lets you hear how truly great Miles was. For some reason, finding AMANDLA on Amazon is a chore. If you search Miles Davis audio, it does not show it, so you have to type in the CD title."
1,Bonus Bummer,"The original album was great music in any genre. Although largely improvised and then spliced together by Miles and Teo Macero, the finished product was finely crafted, because ""Miles knew what he wanted once he'd heard it"", as John McLaughlin said. One advantage of the ensemble playing, is that even when one instrument takes the lead, everyone else fits in behind - it's not one person going off in his own direction for 5 minutes. This was an exceptional double LP on initial release, and the music is still a work of genius.So why one star? The first 6 tracks were a balanced whole. If you want to listen to the outakes, buy the Complete Bitches Brew Sessions. Even then, you probably won't listen to CD's 3 and 4 more than once. Sony have trashed it with the addition of Felo. I'm ticked because I wanted to buy it as a present, but the extra track is an artistic disaster. How soon can we go back to the 24-bit version without someone messing with perfection?"
5,"Once again, Miles produces a knockout recording","This is Miles' first experiment with the 'avant garde' type of music. An incredible mixture of confusing harmonies, and melodious tunes. With a personnel matched by no other, this is the single greatest recording of 'avant garde' I have ever heard, and ever expect to hear."
1,Work of Art...Ruined By Ham-Fisted Echo in Remix,"It infuriates me that apparently nobody seems to notice...or nobody cares...but if you've ever heard the original version of this album on vinyl, or on the original CD release, you know that the echo on ""Pharaoh's Dance"" was originally one of the highpoints of the entire album. I mean, it was even mentioned in the liner notes. In this remixed version, however, the echo effect is hopelessly out of sync, rhythmically incorrect, and sloppy sounding.The (...) who remixed and remastered this important work of art should be ashamed of themselves. It seems that they completely disregarded the way the echo was applied so tastefully on the original, and have just sort of slopped it on in a horrible way on this new version. And now of course this is the only version you can find (on disc anyway). If they weren't smart enough to get it right, they should have left the track echo-free. Miles would be furious.Why not just paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa?"
4,A good book for using for cooking your first thanksgiving,"Lots of good recipes especially for someone attempting to fix their first thanksgiving meal. Most are easy to make, lots of both traditional and updated holiday recipes. The instructions are easy to follow. Not so many recipes to choose from but makes it easier to plan a meal."
4,Early psychological thriller,"Written at a time when psychology was transitioning from a branch of philosophy to one of empirical science, Henry Harland's novel is one about mind control and the unconscious. Just before they are about to be wed, the fiance of a Jewish musician is found murdered; her husband-to-be is accused of the crime - but can't remember anything about it. After a trial, he is acquitted. Much later, however, he discovers a letter written by his father to him ordering him to avenge the murder of his mother. The girl he was about to marry was the daughter of his mother's murderer - thus he really did kill her. It's a pretty far-fetched idea, and Harland isn't subtle where subtlety is required and thus sensationalizes the story, but the book is still fairly well written. As an early psychological thriller, it's not too bad. (Harland wrote this book using the pseudonym Sidney Luska.)"
1,Tithing is of the Law Jesus Said,"Those who would bring Christians under the law of tithing are themselves under the curse: Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.4 Ye are severed from Christ, ye would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace. but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. A little law, Jesus said tithing was of the law in Mat 23:23. Wake Christians, you are being plundered. Eze 34 ""Woe UNTO THE SHEPHERDS....""Please read the Tithe That Binds"
4,"Solid, Strange, Sexy","Junko Mizuno is a weirdo. Her art is doll like, with an adult edge of sex, drugs, and violence. In this book, she takes the classic European tale and retells it with uniquely strange flair. It's easy to get into, because of the story's routes, yet interesting because the telling of that same story is completely insane. Well worth a read"
5,Can't get enough!,"My husband has been deployed now for 1 month and I bought this book to read with my 11 month old. Obviously she doesn't understand why her Daddy is gone, but she can't get enough of this book. I have it memorized because she insists on reading several times a day. I guess it is the illustrations or recognizing the words Mommy and Daddy throughout the story. Whatever it is, we have gotten our monies worth!!"
5,Spiritual Optimism Combined with Acute Social Criticism,"Lerner tackles conservatives who think religion should defend the status quo and liberals who think secular society has all we need. His basic argument is that 'spirit matters' -- people's need for meaning, connection, love, awe, mystery, rest and joy are essential to our happiness; and, when absent, are a source of profound personal and collective malaise. If you don't share Lerner's spiritual optismism, as I don't, you nevertheless will have to confront his insistent questioning about the sources of your pessimism, fear and despair. Not content to rest with generalities about spirit in society, Lerner applies his ideas to medicine, law, education and the environment. Get the book. Read it. Argue about it. It will challenge many of your assumptions about spirituality, politics and society."
1,Blaming Corporate America,"Lerner seeks to blame corporate greed for everything. He presents the failed liberal 60's ideas with a fresh veneer.The style is easy to read, and seductive. But reasoning is frequently fallacious -- and the ""feel good"" generation is again vindicated and absolved of blame as responsibility for all that is less-than-perfect is directed to Lerner's favorite enemies of the state : the ""fat cats"" and big corporations.Profit is seen as inherently evil, and Lerner advocates a radically new score-card system to give rise to a new set of economic and personal values."
2,"Interesting concept, but just not handled well at all.","As a collection, ""The Other"" is a mixed bag. The ASM issues are well done, as are the MK Spider-Man issues. The FNSM issues however are not to my liking thanks to the art of Mike Wieringo. It's just not to my liking at all.The story had potential, but I found it difficult to accept what the writers presented as the payoff for the story and as a consequence, it somewhat tarnishes the overall product greatly.I loved JMS's run on Amazing Spider-Man right up until its final few issues, but these are most certainly nothing close to a high point."
4,A good read.,"Don't expect it to be groundbreaking story, it's still good and take a look byound the normal picture everyone have for Spiderman and his powers.I think it would have been much better if Marvel started acting on the new facts they built here insted of just throwing it all out the window once this story was over in favor of CivialWar saga."
5,Hellecaster Goes Gypsy,"If you know John Jorgensen from the Hellecasters and other music he has made, you know he is excellent on an ax.And often a gypsy jazz group is only as good as the lead player...SO buy this album with no hesitation. It may not be the classics of the genre but it is just plain great. So buy it! And enjoy!!"
4,Great Album!,"As a long time fan of Tahiti 80, I believe this latest work is a great album!It sounds like the one negative reviewer was annoyed that album wasn't more rock? No thanks! I'm happy with the direction this album has gone in. Funky and Smooth!On Xavier's voice and the music sounding the same. He sounds like Xavier and the band sounds like Tahiti 80. What's bad about that? It has the same amount of electronic production as previous albums except it simply sounds more prominent on this one.Overall... just think of their previous songs... but funkier and smoother. Less rock and more relaxation."
4,Quirky But Very Austrailian,"Danny Deckchair is a wonderful Australian product that typifies the gentle humor that they bring to their films. This film is in the genre of The Castle, and is every bit as chariming and whimsical. It leaves you with the feeling that all can come out okay,even when things may quickly turn sour. A lovely movie."
5,The 'essential' first book on the stars,"H. A.

3,Could have been MUCH better!!!,"For this being a product based on a Disney feature film(s) it has some serious drawbacks. The music is terrific. The games, solos and duets are great. HOWEVER, the graphics are horrible--very amateur for a company that has had animated movies for decades. When given the option to sing part 1, part 2 or a mix of them it doesn't tell you if the parts are male or female, lead or harmony, or anything else. You often end up picking the part you didn't want! This could have been such an awesome product--yet it has fallen short!"
2,Bad Publishing Regardless of Material,"The publisher took the text of Charles Haanel and squashed as much of it as possible on each page. The margins are small, and the text is squished upon each other making it very hard to read. This layout and publishing is cheap. This is unfortunate because the material is phenomenal.I recommend the material.I DON'T recommend this book from this publisher."
1,The Master Key System-audio-6CDs-ISBN743571975,"Audio CD buyers, beware. The version that lists an ISBN of 0-7435-7197-5 is not a reading of the original text. It is an audio version of a rewrite by Reverend Ruth L. Miller. The box is red and the title is ""The New Master Key System, Revised for the 21st Century."" Amazon in Canada (amazon.ca) provides a few pages of the actual text which is very different. Even though the US webpage shows a different cover (that appears to correspond to the original text), order with caution unless you want the audio of the book by Reverend Miller."
5,Sage Wisdom at its finest! Nani Aki Linder Author Cross Cultural Approach to Leadership Success,"A friend first sent me this book about two years ago. I was delighted to see as I read that wisdom as expressed by C.F. Haanel is actually ancient wisdom of multi-cultures. It is facinating to note that much of what he expresses are from aboriginal as well as oriental cultures. His depth of knowledge is remarkable. The exercises scientifically back up what many people have thought to be mysterious or magic. His way of teaching is easy to follow. The exercises very astute. Anyone who is interested in awakening the power of the mind, reaching their own path to enlightenment and deeper success would be well advised to read the entire series. Nothing works however unless you do so be prepared to apply the laws of the universe."
1,Don't recommend,"I will probably be sending this back. It's very difficult to understand, I know you're not supposed to read it like a novel, that you are supposed to use it like a workbook, but I still didn't understand it. It just has a bunch of quotes, it's worded in a way that we no longer speak, (it was written over 100 years ago) and I just don't get it. A definate snoozer in my opinion."
1,Mr.,Product did not work. Returned.Also took longer to get than other products I've order from Amazon.
5,Very powerful book.,"I have only started this book one month ago but it is a very powerful book. Its written in a great week by week way, that allows you to pace yourself and really absorb the lessons that it contains. It really helps you to ""key"" into what is really important to YOU and what makes YOU happy, which actually makes you a more considerate, unselfish individual."
3,they don't make them like they used too,THE COMPANY WAS GREAT BUT THE PRICE OF COTTON APPARENTLY HAS INCREASED BY 600% OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THEY WERE TOO THIN FOR MY HUSBAND'S USE. I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE COMPANY FOR A QUICK AND SATIFACTORY REIMBUSEMENT INCLUDING SHIPPING
1,Get What you pay for!(GO NIKON),"This came non working, and after hours of trying Minolta (non)customer service, I packed it up. I did not have a chance to use it , however it was very cheap feeling(plastic). Any company that does not service the customer properly should not be in business.The multiple people I spoke to on the phone and via email were either rude or just didnt care. I tried to give them one more chance and the last girl I spoke to told me she didnt care what I did with it.So,,, look at other sites reviews before you take the plunge, I should have!"
4,It's ok for such a price,"I can say i'm satisfied with what i got for such a low price. Nonetheless, altough the scanner isn't bad, the software could be improved.I can see some artifacts when i use the ""dust removal"" tool so I have to retouch manually most of my scans in photoshop.The ""Pixel polish"" tool delivers often poor results.The ""grain dissolver"" blurs the image a lot... so it can't be compared with a filter like noise ninja or neat image.So if budget is your restriction, this scanner will make it. With a little exploration of the scanning software (maybe you'll finish turning off every image enhancement option, haha) and an adequate understanding of photoshop, you can get very good pictures."
2,Caution when buyiny Minolta Konica,"This system came out during Windows XP, does not work on higher Operating Systems, i,e. Windows 7 +. Have to maintain a XP box, to use. When there are any problems, since Konica/Minolta went BUST, there is no one to ask for help!"
4,"Great on 98, troublesome with XP","The results achieved using this device are outstanding. I bought it in '04 and was running Windows 98. However, I've since purchased a new computer running XP and now I summer from persistent software crashes. I like this scanner enough that I've actually considered buying an inexpensive computer and a copy of Windows 98. However, I'll probably just purchase a new film scanner instead. It's sad to give up such an excellent device because of software issues."
4,good for the price,"I am very content with this product. I don't know why so many people have trouble getting it to work well. It does give spots on the picture if there is dust on you negative or if your negative is old and scratched. I have now scanned in 4600 negatives. It does a good job, easy to keep everything organized with the sofware. I can't get it to work consistently with slides though. The slides I scan in turn out with wierd colors or something. I have mostley negatives so I am scanning those while I wait for a better scanner to do slides. But it does a great job on negatives and after 4600 negatives I can safely say that it is durable."
4,"Starts Out Sort of Advanced, But Well Done","I purchased this book to sort of hone my knowledge of grammar a bit more. I'm tired on not being able to speak and know if I am using verbs, etc correctly. I just want more confidence in speaking and writing. This book starts out a bit advanced, but the exercises are really well put together. I think I am going to review some basics online before really delving into this book, but it will be waiting. So, overall, I am happy with the purchase (used since knew was expensive) and it will prove helpful."
5,A Must Have Christmas CD,The voices of the Vienna Boys Choir are as crystal clear as bells. Just the best renderings of our favorite Christmas songs and hymns. I have given several as gifts and no one was disappointed. A joy to listen to and sure to keep you in the Christmas spirit.
5,FANTASTIC! ! !,"These are the best journals you can buy!!! It doesn't matter if you get this particular journal or another as long as you go with paperblanks!!! When you are writing on this paper is very smooth and the covers of these books are very beautiful and stirty! Also, if you do get this journal than I would recommend paper mate pens. the pens don't bleed through and gives a fantastic touch to this fantastic journal! Paper Mate / Flair Pen, Felt Tip, Red Barrel, Red Ink / PAP84201 There are many different colors but this is one of the cheapest deals and if you want to keep looking, look on amazon for ""paper mate pens flair"". I hope this helps."
1,Super hype,"I am an avid reader of Thoene Books, but I truly expected more from a Theone and am convinced that the family name is all this author has going for him.The plot is extremely limited and reads like the 'B' version of a washed up Clancy novel. I love the fact taht this is written from a christian perspective but it is very much like all the Left Behind rapture stuff combined with every Tom Clancy novel I've ever read. The characters are boxy and the dialogue is comicbook jargon... there should be little bubbles for dialogue and boxed cartoon images for every scene instead of chapters.I can appreciate the attention to detail where the technological aspects of the book are developed, but there is so much that has been left out. will there be more in this series and will it be more of the same or is there some hope that future tomes will improve? I wish I had waited for it to arrive at my public library before I made the purchase."
1,Total Disaster,"My husband and I bought this food mill last summer and it is a total piece of junk! The first we used it, the handle came a part and the whole apparatus went to pieces. It is totally unusable! Please don't make the same mistake we did. Unfortunately I was so busy all summer with two litters of puppies and never send the contraption back - my fault - so am out of the money and left with trash. Maybe I'll send it back anyway, but no, don't want to pay the postage."
4,unlike anything else,"somewhat of a super group! they deliver an piece of work unlike any other i have ever heard! released in the mid 70s,it did not go over well with the music people of that time. the great drummer bobby caldwell is just fantastic here, as he was with captain beyond! this is great music for people who dont like the same old thing!"
1,Bad Customer service,"I ordered this to see if it would be fitting to display some of our products at our office. It ended up being to small for what we needed, so i returned it and received less than half of what i paid for it. I paid around $65 and was refunded around $27. Not happy about that.Not only that, but when i wrote and email asking why I only received a partial refund, they were rude in their response."
4,Helpful,"This book is easy to follow. I learned a lot from it and glad to have read it. I thought there was too much information about self-hypnosis in the beginning. I don't have another self-hypnosis book to compare it to, so I can't find much to complain about. I do reccomend it."
4,Good start but slow in the beginning.,"I liked this book and this series. I really like the way Lily thinks, so it is enjoyable to read the story in first person. The action started right away, but the story itself took a while to get going. Therefore, the title of this review. I highly recommend this book and series. It's refreshing and extremely cozy!"
5,Love this series,Fun quick read. I like this series better than the Sookie stack house/true blood books... You do need to read the series in order although she tries to provide enough back story.
3,Use caution,"This book feels like a ""cozy,"" but readers should be aware of some very horrific violence that will be hard to forget. Not for readers who have suffered personal trauma."
3,Lacked the excitement I was hoping for,"I love the Sookie Stackhouse novels and wanted to try out some of Charlaine's other work. There wasn't anything really wrong with this book. I liked the main character -- kinda. The story was suspenseful -- kinda. Charlaine's humor and cleverness were there -- kinda. You get the idea. All of those things I love about The Southern Vampire Series were just not fully apparent. I don't find myself compelled to read the other books in this series. My sister, however, likes the Sookie Stackhouse books, but doesn't like the sexy parts. This book was much more tame in that aspect, and she seemed to appreciate that."
4,Missing that WOW factor,"I read this book & to Harris' credit I thoroughly enjoyed it. Lily Bard is an interesting character and it's certainly not slow or dull, but ultimately it's a good disposable read. I probably will not remember this book in 5 years time. Don't let that put you off reading this, because if you're after an easy escapist quick read this fits the bill nicely."
4,"Muy divertido y sano para los hijos, Great 4 Kids","Is important to review what your Kids play.This is fun, challenge, and family friendly."
1,Madden NFL 07 sucks!,Terrible game for a bad console (xbox 360). I'd rather play madden 05 on the original xbox any day!
1,"This is horrible and not ""One size fits all""","I didn't read the fine print and missed ""accessory boxed set"". This contains a mask, VERY SMALL cape, and light saber. It does NOT include any pants. The cape on a 4'8"" boy only went down to the waist -- not down to the knees, so the label that it's one size fits all is very deceptive. Not sure why an ""accessory boxed set"" would include the cape and top portion of the costume. Accessories would be items like a saber gloves, and perhaps a voice changer add on. Anyway, this is a rip off and don't waste your time buying this for anyone over 3 feet tall. I'm returning this one."
2,Sam Snead Video,"We were disappointed in this video. It was very simplistic almost to the point of not being helpful. If you have played golf at all or know anything about golf, I would not recommend this video. He did share some helpful information, but overall, it did not educate. Also, some of his tips were contrary to other golfing advice we had received in books, personal experience, and other videos. We watched it once and will not watch it again."
2,"War is awful, this movie is worse.","Okay acting in parts--far too blatant bias. Fiddy is not my hero. Interesting character played by Sam Jackson, though. War is awful, this movie is worse.F. Harrison, author ofWhy Baby Boomers Suck!: (No Offense Mom)"
1,"Should be labeled ""Ranch Flavored""","These nuts taste fine and have enough salt in them to be addictive, but they are certainly mislabeled as simply ""dry roasted"". It's mystifying why Emerald would take savroy nuts like almonds and load them with flavorings and salt to the point where you hardly taste the underlying nut. I would recommend Emerald's flavored peanuts (clearly labeled with seasoning) instead--again you don't get much peanut taste, but peanuts are a lot cheaper. If you persist in desiring these Ranch nuts I'd encourage you to check out your local supermarket for a lower sale price. But you'll always be paying too much."
2,Michelin Red Guide 2005 France,"The Michelin Guides are absolutely invaluable - especially for connoisseurs of good food and wine. The guide is easy to use and provides a miriad of useful information on hotels, restaurants, places of interest, etc. I wouldn't travel to France without it."
3,red suspenders,"My new red suspenders work very well. Since putting them on, my pants have not fallen down...they really work as advertised."
5,Bulldogs,"I didn't have any experience with work suspenders before. Took a chance on these - they were cheap enough. These are great heavy-duty suspenders with shiny nickel-plated 50-pound clips, not your Father's cheap, thin, tinny suspenders. The straps are wide, strong and the clips are big, beefy and clamp tight. Works great to hold up your fully loaded tool and take a strain off you while you work. Treat yourself. I'm glad I did."
3,Snaps don't hold as advertised,"The ad talks about the heavy duty snaps but I have to fold over the waistband of my jeans to get a double thickness for the snaps to grab. Even at that, occasionally a random one will pop loose. And I don't have a big gut that these suspenders have fight against. They were a bargain, but I will try a different brand next time."
3,THESE ARE INCREDIBLY TINY ----,"These are very small. Very, very, very small. I'm 5'11 and pretty skinny and they are WAAAAAY too short.I don't understand how someone who was 6 ft fit into these. i'm assuming they're lying. Because these are just way too small.Other than that well made, nice material.returning them immediately."
2,suspenders by McGuire,"These were not worth the price. They are very hard and not flexable. They are very skimpy. If you buy, make sure you get the next larger size than they say you need. The straps are not sewn together, so they can come off the slide if you do not watch how you are changing the size of the length"
3,One size doesn't fit all.,Have to return them just not quite long enough. I'm about 6-3 or 6-4.but if thay where to fit. I think thay would prouble out live me? They seem to be made with good strong matial.
5,I like suspenders.,A belt will only do you so much good but when the waist outflanks the hips it's time for a new strategy. And suspenders work real good.
3,Enjoyed but,I saw this film a long time ago at a friends house. It is PG-13. Has a great story which touches a cord in anyone who has ever been uprooted and moved repeatedly. Disliked one scene which shows two nude people through a screen. Did not see this scene in the last version I had watched either due to poor picture quality at the time or forgetfulness. Movie has a lot of cute laughs throughout and with the exception of this scene is pretty PG rated...
3,Romantic and cute,I remembered loving this movie way back when (who wouldn't? Delicious Johnny Depp) but I'm not as much in love with it now. It's still lovely.
1,What a disappointment!,"We got our 6yr old daughter the Alfea College playset. She is not even able to play with the dolls for 15 minutes straight without an arm falling off. We have also had a problem with one of the dolls hair falling off.This set may work well for someone who wants to put it on display, but it is definitely not a good toy for children to play with."
5,"okay, but VERY DELICATE","these toys r ok, but they keep falling apart. i had to super-glu stella's hair on. other than that, its an awsome toy for winx fans all over America."
3,Good thing it was on sale...,I purchased the Winx Club Alfea College playset and had to assemble it for my daughter. The problem is that it doesn't stay together very well so I'm always having to put the doors back on. The original price was 34.99 so I'm very glad I found it here for 19.99. Thank you for your prompt service. My daughter received her playset in 2 days and that was regular shipping!
3,"Castle is great, but the dolls are flimsy","This set has some good points and some bad ones, Alfea is great and my 2 daughters love to play with it. The dolls however are flimsy. I don't understand this because the magical minis which are also tiny hold up okay. It took about 2 minutes for the arms to start breaking off and I found myself interrupted all morning to out these dolls back together. By the first night I had gathered all the pieces together and when they were sleeping I super-glued in the arms and legs as well as Icy's hair. This is a fun set and my girls are playing with it a lot, but if you buy it I would suggest glueing the pieces right off and save yourself some time."
5,Winx Club Alfea College,"I love the Winx Club. It's too bad we can't see the show even though we have about 1000 channels. I checked for my daughter, Kali. She has ALL of the Winx Club Accersories!I give this toy 5 stars!"
1,I've Read Better Written Middle School Newspapers,"This book is supposed to deal with a serious subject called child abuse. The result is a sad and sometimes hilarious attempt at writing about a serious topic. The whole thing has a ""vanity press"" feel to it. This has obviously been written by an author ""wannabe."" I've read high school papers more entertaining than this. Please save your money. I know a woman who bought a copy of this book and threw it away before she finished it."
1,"$15,045.59? really?","Check you ad. $15,045.59 ???The Carol Burnett Show - The Collector's Edition, Vol. 2 Carol Burnett (Actor), Vicki Lawrence (Actor) | Format: DVD(2 customer reviews) | (8)Available from these sellers.1 new from $15,045.59 3 used from $30.95"
2,Smells BAD,"This belt smells very bad. It is not the belt in the picture. The belt I received did not have the nice stitching up the sides, but is instead made of three pieces riveted together. Also it is a much darker brown than that pictured."
2,predictable,"The movie was from a routine formula. No depth, just predictable scenes. If you want to waste a bit of time and not be challenged to think or feel, this is just the thing for it."
1,Not as advertised,I did not receive the battery in a retail blister pack as shown. It arrived in a baggie and appears to be used as it does not hold a full charge.
3,Beware of Built-in Speakers,"I like the HP w1907 monitor's picture, but a real drawback are the built-in speakers which are in back, facing face away from the screen. I have volume turned up 100% and still have trouble hearing even with no background noise in the room. This is a serious problem and HP should correct it."
4,Good Value,"Great value for the money, but.....Built-in speakers are poor.Tried to setup under VGA Windows XP and found text very hard to read. Changed the Resolution from the default to 1360 X 768 to give my eyes a break. Aside from that, no complaints.John"
1,Very hard to read text,"I recently purchased this monitor and it is the absolute worst monitor I have ever had.It gets one star only because one is the lowest rating, otherwise, I would give it a zero.While the picture quality is good for photos, it is very difficult to read text. I have tried all of the adjustments in the manual, which took a great deal of time, and it is still poor quality.Text looks like parts of the letters are missing. It's like a bad digital photo."
1,Very Dissappointed Parents,"What a pile of junk, just sitting on a table it will skip. This is the worse thing I have ever bought for our son. The sound is very poor as well, it is very distorded. I will be returning this thing back to the store in the morning."
4,Entertains your child and your wallet!,"To be honest, my son loves his video now player.. he has the ability to watch all of his favorite characters- Seaseme Street, Barney, The Wiggles... anywhere we go. But my problem is that we have only had the player for 12 days and I have had to change the batteries 3 times (It takes 3 AA) and he does not use the player that much, maybe an hour a day.. if that. The other problem is that the batteries die and you cant see the movie only hear it and your toddler goes nuts! I think it would have been a 100% better toy if it had an adapter - it has a place for headphones (my toddler wouldnt dare wear headphones!) but I havent had any luck with an adapter - This item seems to be very costly with videos at $10 a pop and then batteries every 3 days! On the flip side, we took the video now to the mall with us - as we shopped he quietly sat in his stroller watching Elmo and the letter Y. Until the batteries died."
2,worked 1 month,"Just wanted to warn everyone that the purple and yellow Video Now Jr. like the one my daughter got for Christmas of '04 may not be replaced by the company if it is defective. Our's worked barely a month when it quit detecting the disk. I mistakingly thought it just needed better batteries and shelfed it for a while. When I called the company about the problem, I was told it was no longer under warrenty. Better keep your reciept guys, because Wal-Mart is more likely to stand behind this product than Playschool."
4,Great on-the-go!,"I just bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She really enjoys it. I liked the idea of having a portable tv in the car, especially on long drives to Disneyland (from San Jose). Overall, my daughter has used it on & off for several hours. I have not changed the batteries once yet! The screen comes out very clear (especially for being a ""toy"") and in perfect pitch. It helps that you can adjust the screen clarity, & of course, the volume. She can walk & watch the player at the same time, with little skipping. For us, this was a great buy."
5,Son loves it,We've had this toy since Christmas of 2005 and my son still loves it. The only con is #1- now it's hard to find the discs/movies; #2- it goes through batteries like crazy so it's best to get rechargables.
2,Dead and Paralyzed,"Antony Sher's performance was very good, but otherwise this film is laughable. We keep searching for a reason to care about Jason Flemyng's character, but we're never given one. So the final scene, where a paralyzed Flemyng is carried around a dance performance like he was the Stanley Cup, comes off as absurd and unintentionally funny."
1,Nice watch but bad service,"I saw the adv on the website and liked the watch , i placed the order immediatly , when i received the piece i checked it i found that the tounge in the bottom flap is missing , this means in simple and plain words that i cant wear it , i contacted Amazon customer service , they told me to conatct the vendor , i wrote them email and attached a photo to prove my claim however i didnt get any response , contacted Amazon again who wrote me at the end that they cant replace the item , the only option i had is to return it , and since I'm living outside the states at this moment i found that the shipping cost will be almost equal to the price of the watch , now i kept it with the hope that i will take it to a repair shop to find an alternative for that missing part , i advise every body to be carefull when buying expensive things through the web."
5,COBOL ESTRUCTURADO,nocesito el software de cobol orientado a objetos. le agradezco me escriba a la brevedad posible y me envie las condiciones de pago
1,Less than 1 Star,"This book is one of the worst I have had the misfortune of reading. It is loosely put together from a ""pile"" of essentially useless information, most of which comes from ""conversations"", rather than well researched documentation. The first chapter should have been the tipoff to quit reading. The description of the renovations to a house by a wealthy couple is so vapid, that I found myself wondering why they let the author use them in the book; and the relevance to the rest of the book is so obscure, that it is almost nonexistent. This book does a beautiful, historic town a grave disservice by presenting a skewed, smarmy overview of the lives of a very select group of people who live there. Definately a thumbs down book."
2,Dark spirits in still waters,"There is a Russian saying which says that 'dark spirits lurk in still waters. Vlad Putin is just such a dark spirit. There is a facinating story in Vald's life but, sadly, you won't find it here. Where is any detail about his St. Petersburg days? What was he doing in East Germany? How did he become the head of the FSB or the head of the largest country in the world? According to Vlad, it was all like some kind of dream. Becoming president of the largest country in the world in a time which may be among the most interesting in it's long history and he attributes it to some kind of dumb luck.It is really too bad that he didn't touch on any aspect that made his life interesting.As a side note, I feel Putin is a dangerous man. History will judge but I have a gut feeling."
4,Insight into political training,I found this book provided a much needed insight into Putin and it assists when trying to cut through the politics of popular culture. With an extremely challenging road ahead for this country it is important not to loose sight of the men who assert power
5,"First Person Putin,passes with flying colors","Here is a man who knows how to get things done,the right way.This is an excellent book with lots of personal flare.It seemed to me that he was most forward and honest with all his answers and this makes me wish him well all the more.I am an Educational Researcher and have started up a program with his school children here in the States.They are very into who they are as a people and are to be commended on how their government works.(I am talking Elemetary level)And they adjust as quickly as change happens.This book will let you meet a man and his family with warts and all,and it will,hopefully,remind you we all are in want of a good,happy,healthy life with friends who offer us good cheer and their love.The photos are priceless,just see them for yourself!!May you enjoy it as much as I do.I have gone through it 3 times........it is that good.Sincerely,Susan Anson"
3,"Great music, recorded badly ?","Chapman is a great writer and performer and there is a lot of good material here, but the recording has a really muddy sound that makes it less than it should be. Was particularly disappointed as I had bought the CD on the strength of a recent performance at the Filmore that brought home for me the power and clarity of Chapman's voice, qualities that just do not come thru on this recording. Gave it several listens on different pieces of equipment and my initial opinion did not change. Anyone else bothered by the sound, or is it just me?"
5,Harmony Stitch Guide Vol. 3,"I purchased Vols. 2, 3, & 4 at the same time through Amazon, and had purchased Vol. 5 (Aran Stitches and Patterns) at my local yarn store. While these books are not meant to give you complete patterns, like for an entire sweater, they provide seemingly endless ideas for patterned stitches, including cables, knit/purl combos, slip stitch mosaics, texture & color stitch techniques, and even lace patterns. I'm so thrilled with these books that I hardly know where to start with the experimentation, but I would definitely recommend the entire collection to anyone serious about knitting or designing their own knitted items."
3,440 More Knitting Stitches - Volume 3,"Has some great knitting stitches in it, however, there is not enough dialog about the stitch and there are not enough lace stitches."
2,Recycled photography ruins stitch patterns,"This book looks like it is a compilations from older black and white photographs with a few newer color photographs. While the stitches look interesting and many are clear and easy to see, too many of them are colorized from black and white photographs. Most importantly, these original photographs were not clear to begin with, so the colorizing obscures them further."
4,Never lose a drop of wine again!,"I learned about the Drop Stop from a friend and can't find them in local stores. Thankfully, the Internet makes it possible to get them. These are great for the wine-lover in your life and they're affordable enough to have on hand for those moments when you need a last-minute gift. I like that I can pour wine and not have drips run down the bottle."
1,Very poor quality,"It was difficult to figure out how to cover the bicycle with this cover, as it didn't seem to have any demarkations for installation. It started coming apart after the first use. A large (about 1 foot long) tear appeared; I attempted to tape it with duct tape, but it not only came apart again, but ripped in several other places as well. I would recommend that anyone needing a bicycle cover buy a better quality one than this -- you get what you pay for."
5,Good part,"Order was processed quickly. This part was slightly different from the original part, but installation was easy. Blowing air at all speeds now!"
1,awful,I wanted to like this film really I did but I found it quite boring! I thought it would leave me feeling awesome like I did with 'Ray' but all I saw was Reese and Mr Phoenix. Not Johnny Cash and June Carter. I really hated the end. I thought it would get in to their marriage but it ended as she finally said yes to his proposal.
4,Excellent Director's Cut,"This verison of ""Walk the Line"" is the best way to see this movie. The added elements flesh out the characters, making ofr a better film overall."
2,Disappointed in this movie. Give 2 1/2 stars,"Loved the music in this movie and went to see it expecting to really love the movie...but I was unimpressed. Good acting but the story was just another star on drugs and recovering.I was also distracted by the unfortunate scar on Phoenix's face. I know he can't help it but it was very distracting to me watching ""Johnny Cash"".My assessment will be in the minority but I didn't come out of this movie thinking ""gee, great acting"" ""wow, inspirational story"". When I came out my thoughts were, I'm glad I saw it and glad it is over except I may buy the CD. I won't buy the DVD."
5,Great movie,I had seen the movie a while back and ordered this because it was a good price...and it's blu-ray. :) It is a very good movie.
3,I have not watched it,Bought it as a gift for my grandaughter. I will probably wach it eventually. I'm not into these type movies. Chick Flick.
2,Casting and singing,"Reese Witherspoon was wonderful per usual and she captured the quirky personality of June Carter. Phoenix was not so good. He ought not have tried to sing it himself either. Johnny Cash's voice was clear as a bell and JP's muddy and nasal. Johnny and June were much bigger than this movie made them out to be, I think."
4,"Fine performances, episodic storytelling","Stars Phoenix and Witherspoon are the movie. Their performances are top-drawer as, surprisingly, is their singing. Phoenix worked hard to master the tics and idiosyncracies of Johnny Cash. In fact, having seen Cash in concert on several occasions, I occasionally felt that some of the signature gestures, such as the pout and guitar slinging were a bit overdone.The storyline wasn't all that engrossing. Too much emphasis for me on a few selected episodes from Cash's life and nothing at all mentioned about many of Cash's excesses.Johnny Cash was a solid performer and also a man who made many poor choices in his life and lived with them. I don't think he would have been offended to see incidents like his firing by Grand Ole Opry included in the film, considering that he more than made up for that behavior in later years.Overall though, it's a pretty good film.Jerry"
5,walk into my heart,I loved this movie. I love the music and the honesty. The extended cut version has some interesting new scenes.
2,Justice?,"This film focuses on the prescription drug addiction too much! Johnny Cash was more talented that this movie protrays! June Carter was the angel that probably saved his life and made him famous so why not dig and little deeper into their marriage. Come on HOLLYWOOD! He gave much more to entertainment than this movie leads one to believe. Why not start with the beginning and end with the respectable life he led instead of just the beginning of his career. Can't believe his son, John Carter Cash would let people by with this one! Nothing to make one want to see it twice!"
5,"Because you're mine, I Walk The Line.","I could go on forever about how awesome this movie is. The acting story, drama, music, performances, and romance in Walk the Line. The life of Johnny Cash was incredible. He experienced fame, addiction, love, heartbreak, and everything in-between. Though this film, the amazing acting of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and the awesome music, we can see a bit of what this legendary man did. This film is like no other. It's a must see for fans of Cash, fans of music in general, or fans of pure entertainment. You have to see this incredible movie."
4,Great Movie ****,"You do not have to be a Johnny Cash fan to love this movie. It is a great story from beginning to end. It starts with Cash's child hood tragedy and goes up to when he gets June Carter to marry him. It is Johnny Cash's autobiography. It shows his rise to stardom and the toll it took on his family life, and how much June Carter really meant to him. There are great cameos of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. The actor playing Jerry Lee was great the Elvis was weak. The remade songs were better than the originals. Great Movie!"
4,one thing I noticed that is missed from the story,"Great media. The actors performed their parts well. However,of all the comments that I have seen no one has mentioned that once again native American history is ignored. At least one reference to ""Ira Hayes"" or other songs from the Bitter Tears album would have been appropriate."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,This was a great movie. I saw Walk that line with my family who really likes Johnny Cash AND June Carter Cash. I really thought Joajuin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did wonderful. Now I always listen to Walk that line soundtrack. I cant wait for Walk the Line to come out on Dvd. I know I am getting that movie. I really want to see it again.
3,Reese Gives Best Performance of the Year and Second Best of the Movie,"We watched this multiple Academy Award nominee on DVD, having missed it in the theatre. My daughter is a big Reese Witherspoon fan and my wife grew up near Nashville--so the movie seemed like a good fit. I didn't find anything terribly wrong with it. At one level it seemed a lot like ""Ray"", the biopic of Ray Charles, but maybe that's just because the lives of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles traveled similar paths. The most surprising thing to me was all the fuss about Witherspoon's performance--she was a consensus favorite to win the Best Actress Oscar and did so. Her singing was a nice surprise, but I thought Joaquin Phoenix was much stronger in his role as Johnny Cash."
2,This Film Drags on Forever,"Grade:CWho forgot to tell these directors that you can only sit and watch people muck up their lives for UNDER 2 HOURS?Yes, you read correctly. Johnny Cash mucks up his life for an entire 2 hours of the movie. Well, maybe 110 minutes.Plus, the photography switched from looking like an amateur hand-held job to looking like Joaquian Phoenix (sp?) was a mad bull released on the set and the camera guy had to keep a closeup on him while J. Phoenix ravaged the set.However, this movie did give you a much better understanding of the late Johnny Cash. While I didn't care too much for parts of the movie, he is still a great singer and Reese Witherspoon and J. Phoenix do a good job with their roles.I also believe that Reese Witherspoon's Oscar for this movie was 200% deserved and -although I didn't see CAPOTE- I think Joaquin Phoenix should have won here."
2,Sorry this is disappointing,"While the acting of Phoenix is very strong, he did not convey the endearing side of Cash, and that is more the writer or directors mistake, and I must agree with J Whitney that the two actors just don't have the chemistry either. And, while the cinema realite is very internal, I think the end of the film was wanting, because Mangold chose to ignore Cash's Nickajack Cave incident, which was his lowest point and his struggle with God... and as a result, it missed Cash's epiphanic moment.One thing Hollywood won't get is the heart of evangelical religion.Cash took it all to the edge to show that life is a messy conflux. That is why he is loved by people of all sorts, a very rare type.Three stars are missing..."
1,L-O-U-D!,"Works well enough it's just way too loud. I'm not sure the decible rating but if the stanard noise from a Wii is a 10 out of 100, I would say that this thing bumps it up to a 30 out of 100. I thought I would use this to prolong the life of my Wii but it's so loud that I have had to disconnect it.A special note of interest is that this runs even when the Wii is in offline/lowpower mode connected to Wii forecast and news (you know, when the amber light is on). This of course is a huge minus for those who leave their Wii in this mode."
3,"Great for me, but...","I like another reviewer live in a hot climate, where overheating is more likely. This product gets the job done very well, especially considering the heat that is generated by other items near the wii in the entertainment center.Pros: It works very well, especially for the price. I have seen a noticable temperature drop while opperating.Cons: It is very loud when the Wii is not in use. It personally bugs me so much that I unplug it when not in use, which severly hinders WiiConect 24 and the Internet Channel."
1,Do Not Buy This Item..,This intercooler fan is EXTREMELY LOUD! I have to literally turn the Wii off after gameplay because it's soo loud and it interfere with gameplay because it is soo loud!! I'm trying to find a fan that's little to no sound and still works.
2,Fan is too loud,"Because I live in a hot climate and because I have WiiConnect set on, I decided a little extra insurance against overheating would be a good thing and got the Nyko Intercooler. (I have and am satisfied with the Nyko Charger). Attaching the unit to the console was a simple task, but for me the fan is far too loud. Granted, I have a small house, but the unit is so noisy I can hear the fan from other parts of the house.If it had been more expensive I probably would have returned it, but I decided the refund wasn't worth the cost of shipping it back. As I still want that extra insurance, I'm making it work for now by powering off the console between play instead of using standby mode. It's too noisy, though, for me to recommend it."
5,superb creativity,This is a wonderful story. The characters are woven through the story so well you feel like you know them by the time you`re finished with it.You always hope their in the next book.
3,Garwood does it again,Another great read by Julie Garwood. No one writes a love story quite as well. I couldn't stop reading. Loved it!
5,Great story!,This is one of Julie Garwood's best stories. I have read quite o few of her historical romanaces and I am capticated everytime! All of her characters are easy to fall in love with!
1,"If you value good writing, skip this turkey","I am absolutely baffled by the five-star reviews for this book. This is only the second book I've read of Julie Garwood's and it will be my last. Her characters are cliche, inconsistent and annoying. Her writing is stiff and staccato with uninteresting and repetitive dialogue. I usually find the reviews on amazon helpful, but they let me down with this one."
1,Every day will be like a holiday-William Bell,I have been looking for this song for a long time and I thought if i couldn't find it anywhere I could fine it here but when i thought i found it it was unavailable to listen to and I don't think that it is the right thing for you and your company to decide which selection people want to listen to because the population is not all youth even though i am young I was raised on old school music and I really want to make sure that i am getting the right music and not the wrong one like the sweet inspirations.
5,Great replacement measuring tape,Needed to replace the adhesive measuring tape on my delta tablesaw. The Kreg cut easy and installed easy. Was even able to move it a few times to get it where I needed it and it still stuck. Very accurate.
1,BAD PURCHASE,I purchased two stuhrling watches - one for me and one for my wife. I sent mine back and kept hers. She wore it for about 5 weeks and the watch stopped working. I paid $134.00 for a 5 week watch & now i am over my 30 day return option. I am very unhappy and will never order from stuhrling EVER AGAIN !!!!!
3,"""Two Women"" print quality is poor.","There are some major problems with the print of ""Two Women"".1. In spite of the box claiming the film was digitally re-mastered, it isgrainy and unfocused--difficult to watch on a large HD screen.2. The aspect ratio of the film was cut from 1.66:1 to full-screen TV (1.33:1).3. English is dubbed.""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow was not similarly altered. It is fine."
4,A New Barker in the House-- by: Tomie dePaola,"In this book, Morgie and Moffie's parents adopt a three-year-old Spanish-speaking boy, Marcos. Morgie and Moffie (twins) get excited and over-do it a little the first day. They forget that their new brother doesn't understand them when they speak to him in English. On the second day, Morgie and Moffie realize that they should teach their brother things as well as learn from him. Marcos fits in better now, and they are a family. My favorite character in this book was Marcos. I would recommend this book especially for parents to read to their children if they are adopting a child, whether or not the child is from a foreign country. I would also recommend it to anyone else looking for a good book about family."
4,Worth the purchase,Useful exercises and many of them! A great alternative to weights. Just wish the photos were in color. :-)
2,A trainer,"If it sounds too good to be true it probably is. Why are so many people trying to take a quick profit from fitness? Why do they all claim to be able to make you fit in three days a week twenty minutes a day? They do it because they can and no one can stop them except the people who DO NOT buy their books or whatever other gizmo they offer.I've trained thousands of people and I know that the most effective fitness program contains resistance and cardio training along with nutrition and proper rest. If someone tells you otherwise, grab your wallet."
1,This book is dangeres!,"I am a professional fitness trainer certified by the American Collage of Sports Medicine and the National Academy of Sports Medicine, and my advice is to stay far away from this book. This book is nothing new just a lot of hype and recycled information. I am really upset I wasted my time and money on this garbage.The author of the book suggest a diet plan in which you would be consuming about 1200 calories a day. If you are eating around only 1200 calories a day you will lose a lot of weight even if you are sitting on the couch all day. But ask your self these questions....Will you be able to maintain this extremely strict calorie intake for the rest of your life to keep the weight off? Will your body be able to function properly and stay healthy on only 1200 calories? The answer to these questions is NO!!!!!!"
3,Mickey Mouse Halloween Costume,The costume looked cute on our son but the legs kept riding up. I think we will stick to buying costumes in store from now on.
5,Surprisingly Good,"I have to admit, when this Disney animated movie came out, I had no intention of seeing it. Why? David Spade. He's just one of those guys that gets on my nerves so I try to avoid his work. But when Emperor's New Groove came out on video, someone gave it to me as a gift, knowing I collect all the major Disney animated releases.Well, I laughed and laughed a lot. The story is simple, but hey, it's a kids movie. But it is one the adults can enjoy. I thought John GOodman also did a good job."
5,"""A toast to the Emperor!""","When I first heard about the plot of the revamped ""Kingdom of the Sun"" I thought it was going to be the worst animated Disney feature in history. Most songs from Sting were not going to be used at all. However, The Emperor's New Groove turned out to be a fantastic movie, in my opinion at least. It had some bad reviews and a lot of criticism from Disney-fans. But, I'm a long-time Disneyfan myself and I must say that, although it's definitely not what you expect from Disney, this movie is NOT to be missed! If you haven't seen it yet, order it now. The 'Ultimate 2 Disc Edition' contains a lot of extras which make it well worth the little extra money above the standard edition. You will watch this movie over and over again. Guaranteed! ""Long live Kuzco!"""
1,Talk about baseball instead,"This movie stars David Spade as a ""llama."" Who cares about a llama? Well, he does not start out as one. The movie is about an emperor who gets a spell cast on him. This movie is lame."
3,Emperor,This is a good movie but the it could have done without the narration. My kids like it because of the llama. Some more singing and dancing and I believe they would have truly loved it.
2,Bad Movie! this is not Disney!,"This movie is really bad I got the 2 Disc Edition DVD, I cant see Disc 2 in may Playstation 2! anyway the movie is not cool, boring and even insulting, the Great Ancient Incas must be angry in his Graves! Disney should make more research in that culture there are hundreds of tales that could be animated from Incas and they did a bunch of trash! I love disney but this time the movie was BAD, how you can compare this movie with the great movie Tarzan? and the characters really [are bad]! I feel really disapointen in this movie..."
3,The Emperors new Groove is a pretty groovy movie,"The ""Emperor's New Groove"" really is a neat little movie. Usually Disney has the same plotline that they just repackage every year or so, but this movie is a total break from that.To say this movie is quirky is not telling the whole story. It looks more and feels more like an independent arthouse movie. The animation is sleek and modern, and the script is extremly clever.The Cast fills the roles perfectly,Don't miss this movie!"
5,The Emporers New Groove-Fabulously Funny!,"I love this movie! I have bought two copies now. This movie was a side-splitting comedy when I first saw it in the theater, and still is every time I view it again. The jokes and little jibes throughout are great, never a dull moment! David spade is awesome, as well as ""Cronk""-the best! Every time I see this movie again I find another joke thrown in there that I didn't notice the last time. Hilarious!-Defiantly a keeper!"
4,One of disneys best new films it's original and funny,"In the past feew years disney has come out with not so good films but this film changes it, it's on of disneys best ever. The story is original hip and funny from start to finish. This film is lie Shrek so it has more grown up jokes that young kids would not understand. The voices are great for the charactors and the animation is also great. overall one of disney's newest classic's the film is great to watch over and over again."
4,A lot of fun.,"This is a noisy film, but a fun one. I certainly would recommend it over one of Disney's typical cookie-cutter musicals. I just wish it went even further with the zany humor and forgot about trying to be ""deep,"" or give it a ""message."" People want to laugh, not get preached at on the importance of *a friend*."
4,Well-presented,I still have the textbook from an English History class that starts where this one leaves off and had become interested to see what was known about the times in that part of the world before 1399. Lovely to find this available.
3,Joyless,"I used to admire Barbra Streisand because she was innovative, bold & different. Now I can't tell her apart from Celine Dion or Lara Fabian. She has become, God forbid, like them. Perhaps it is because she is so in love that her Chistmas Memories CD is so laidback. I better play this CD AFTER all the guests have left or they will soon pack up & go. make no mistake about it, I am still a Barbra Streisand fan & I still faithfully buy every new CD. But even before I tear open the sealing on the CD, I can tell you how Barbra is going to sing that song, how she is going to phrase it. She has become so very predictable & that's bad."
4,Excellent Alternative Holiday Music,"I had to listen to this album a couple of times before it really settled in with me, but I have to say that I actually prefer it now to her first Christmas album from the 1960's, and that's saying quite a lot. Each song is beautifully and emotionally sung, and the arrangements are stunning. The only two songs that I thought were somewhat weak were the final 2 cuts, Closer and One God. Neither song resonates with me, so I usually skip them.I highly recommend this album as a wonderful alternative to the usual holiday music fare."
2,Shouldn't be categorized as Christmas music,"Other than the use of the word ""Christmas"" in the title and a few of the lyrics, and possibly because the winter season is a topic in some songs, there's nothing about this CD that would cause me to relate this CD to Christmas music. I love Christmas music, but I'm oh so weary of the same songs on every one of them. That's why I bought this CD -- I thought it would be some new songs, plus, Barbara Streisand singing them. Her voice is nice..."
3,Jingle Tills .......,"In a market where most every Yuletide recording covers the same old tracks (don't they write new Christmas songs anymore?) I was pleased to see Barbra finally found some new things to say (sing). Having loved the mix of good cheer, whacky humour and sacred sentiment on the earlier ""A Christmas Album"" I forgot how seriously the 'born in Madagascar, raised in Rangoon' artist is taking herself and her craft these days. The result is a commercial Christmas memory (one I don't share), sung with greater depth and vocal maturity but more with an eye on the cash till and less on the yule log or manger, than before."
5,Memories Forever...,"Barbra Stresand proves that there is still hope for the devastating time we are facing now by giving us these precious songs to be strong and forgiving to human race such as Closer and ONE GOD plus the passions of I remember,Ave Maria and the uplifted A Christmas Lullaby, Grown Up Christmas List and it must have been the mistletoe and the rest. Streisand Voice still reminds us that she is the World's Greatest Singer with the combined of her emotions and projection of a song she sings that makes the different from other artists."
4,"It's After Christmas, and I Still Like It","It's fascinating to see the love it/hate it split between the reviews here. I for one like this CD, and it's one that I continue to play after Christmas when I'm tired of the same old holiday tunes. Maybe it's because some of the tracks are not traditional Christmas music but have a lyric that touches on the season or the spiritual. I like listening to new music and would probably have rated this CD a ""5"" if not for the inclusion of other artists' overplayed ""Grown-Up Christmas Wish"" and ""It Must Have Been the Mistletoe."" Yet the songs that were previously unfamiliar to me, such as ""Closer,"" ""I Remember"" and ""A Christmas Love Song,"" are the ones I can't stop humming. And wouldn't it be great if ""One God"" got some radio airplay in these troubled times?"
4,"Great, easy to understand book.",This book was great for the beginner. It breaks down scoring into easy to understand sections. Great examples are used from prominent composers. Definitely a must have for anyone who is just getting serious about composing for picture.
3,Light but entertaining science reading,"This is good anecdotal collection of scientific diputes which could have been written as a series in a popular science magazine. Its emphasis is on the personalities involved in scientific disputes over the years, and a general description of the nature of the debate. The book makes little attempt to delve into the psychology of the scientific mind. Nor does it try to pin to together a consistent philosophical basis underlying scientific progress, paradigms and debates. You are left with a series of vignettes of roughly 20 pages a piece, well written and entertaining, which offer little penetration and cohesion into the 'nature' of scientific conflict. As a quick survey of scientific progress and perhaps as a guide to more in depth reading it is a good work, especially for the young reader"
5,Scientifically challenged will love science & this book!,"If science remained a mystery in high school due to outdated texts and dry formulae, Great Feuds in Science will illuminate and stimulate. The scientific material is transmitted in understandable language no matter how formidible the topic. Hellman invites the reader to share in the drama as well as the science of conflict and discovery. Injustices are revealed and vengeance is defined whether in feuds of centuries ago or in the recent decades. This is a good read!"
3,How great science REALLY gets done,"Scientists are human, too. They have pride, turf, and overbearing egoes. This little book, with its chapters relating disagreements and outright feuds between scientific luminaries, shows how the March of Science rarely proceeds in lockstep. The fur flies the thickest in Newton versus Leibniz, concerning the invention and popularization of calculus. This is a good ""sidebar"" book, to go along with a more conventional history of science. The human drama within provides a couple of nights of good reading."
3,"Nice concert, but something missing. . . .","The thing I like best about concerts on dvd is the ability to hit the NEXT button when I would like to skip a song. Can't do that on VHS tapes. Can't do that on Paul McCartney's latest dvd, either. There are no chapters."
3,"Love Paul, but DVD lacks overall","I saw paul this october in houston with my mom. I thought the show was the best production I've ever seen live, but this DVD failed to capture that essence. the camera picture quality was comparable to VHS ""poor to average"" also it follows a mixture of behind the scenes which intersect the concert resulting in cut-off songs and late intro's. I felt they should have stayed true to the concert and left the extra stuff just like that, as ""DVD extra's"".Picture = VHS qualitysound = very goodContent = behind the scenes interfear with concert footage.You'll like this DVD if you haven't seen the concert live, but if you have you will be dissapointed."
2,"I love Macca, but...","If only this concert DVD was one-tenth as good as ""Concert for George,"" but it fails by almost every standard. I'm a life-long Macca fan, I've seen him in concert 12 times, but this DVD is extremely disappointing. How so? Well, the picture quality is spotty, sometimes the screen is too dark, other times it's annoyingly bright. The sound quality doesn't sound like it was mixed correctly, it has a tinny edge to it. The bass lines seem fuzzy, the percussion seems too ""thumpy.""It's disappointing, because Paul is a perfectionist (as you all know), and he rarely puts out something of this inferior quality. Something went wrong somewhere, but when a Beatles fanatic doesn't even get a tingly feeling when Paul launches into ""Hey Jude,"" you know something is wrong. I wanted so much to like this since I adore Paul, but it just isn't happening."
3,Concert DVD Opinion,"My recommendation is for putting out another DVD with the full concert version of the show only. The backstage interviews and fan scenes should be as an extra bonus DVD in the package . The Music and performance is of course great however some of the scenes on the DVD are grainy. There should have been more of a live looking concert than the typical movie touch up . For example the "" Who Live at Albert Hall "" is a great looking concert DVD as well as the Rolling Stones Bridges to Babylon . However all in all i still recommend buying this DVD , lets just hope they put another DVD version out one day soon with the neccesary corrections . Note to the director and marketing company of this DVD ""listen to the Fans opinions ."
3,"No, Scene Selection, Duh!!!","McCartney's concert performance with this terric band gets A+, unlike prior tours he really rocks these songs this time. However the NO scene selection feature on the DVD gets a D-, which is why only three stars!!!"
1,TERRIBLE CONCERT DVD FROM MILLIONAIRE PAUL!,Just can't believe that someone ... with that much money could put out a piece of crap like this!! so so disappointing Paul!!we need a direct live show NO FILM! and direct to DVD without 90%of audience... Pauls pretty taken with his old self!! nice dye job!
5,Awesome DTS sound and image quality,Full of Beatles and Wings hits. The show has an overwhelming atmosphere of joy. Awesome DTS sound and image quality. best buy ever.
3,"Tour documentary, not a concert","I bought this on release day, expecting to relive the concert. What I found was a documentary of the tour with some on stage performances thrown in. It is like a roller coaster ride, song performance - thrilling ride, then back to the tour - OK, song, back to the tour, etc.. After the 5th crazed fan scene, I got the message - Paul is still loved, after the 15th, I got the message already! As far as I'm concerned - It's about the music, and there wasn't enough. Many concert or music documentary productions have a Menu selection to only play the songs, this doesn't even have that. Five ***** stars for the music, ** for the video that kept interrupting the music. Oh, for what could have been."
5,Monster Concert Film!,"My only complaint is that it should have been a double DVD set instead of the single that it is. (Hey ... Maybe we can all e-mail Paul and press him to release a 2nd DVD with all the missing stuff!) Would have had room for ALL the songs he did on the tour with no cuts. Other than that, I feel like history will remember this as a grand event ... as it should be.Make no mistake ... This film ROCKS!!!"
4,Good..but it could have been better,"Since I like the Beatles and Paul...it is hard not to give this four stars just based on the generous amount of Beatle tunes. First the good. Paul sings great. Band is great. DTS surround is very nice. Seems like all the big hits are included. Now for my problems. The video is filmed, not shot with High Def cameras. So the picture is not what it could have been. It is not widescreen either. Since in a few years everyone will have HD widescreen, it would have been nice to preserve such a timeless concert as this in that format. What annoys me the most is that there is too much focus on the crowd. I hate it. I don't want to see the crowd singing, reacting, etc, to everything. A few shots here and there is ok...but there is way too much. I want to see Paul...that's it. All concerts should be like the James Taylor DVD. Music first."
2,Sir Paul could do so much better..........,"DVD would be great without narration and interruption. Navigation from track to track is sketchy at best. C'mon Paul I paid over $240 to see you live in concert and it was worth every penny. This DVD barely justifies 20 bucks. Get back to where you once belong, Paul."
1,RESTORED? A mixed bag,"I was thrilled when I heard about the Chaplin At Keystone project back in 2003. I waited 8 years for this to be complete, and sad to say it's a great let down. First off the prints are taken from 35mm nitrate originals, and the quaility is clear and sharp. However, these prints have so much negative surface wear that it takes away from the overall quaility. I don't mind surface wear, after all we are dealing with prints that have been printed away so many times that wear, even in original Keystone prints, are bound to be visible. But when nothing is done to try and remove some of the more serious wear, I have an issue. Another problem is the music scores choosen. At times the scores are down right horrible, and do not add to the enjoyment of the film. After reading some of the reviews I was expecting pristine prints. I wish Flicker Alley was more up front."
1,Still Bad Doggie,"5 times, I sprayed the loveseat with this spray. Took a nap on the couch. Woke up to see my dog asleep on his back on the loveseat... zero effect!"
1,Good Human repellent,"I hate to be negative, but I wanted to let others know about my experience with this product. At this point, I'm not sure it would repel a fly, let alone a dog or cat. The overwhelming smell DID manage to repel all the humans in the house. After spraying my couch, my dog promptly jumped up on it and looked at me like I was crazy. So I moved her off and sprayed it again. She jumped right back up and made herself at home. Same thing with the cat. It's very dissapointing."
2,A good Kashmirian book,"This is a book where Rushdie displays his Kashmirian roots most clearly. The title itself is taken from the 11th Century masterpiece Katha-sarit-sagar, ``Ocean of Story'', by Somadeva."
5,storytelling for all ages,A wonderful children's tale. A political satire. A fable of freedom of expression. Wonderfully written. Extraordinary use of words.
3,Lenny.,"Some of the songs kinda blend together but songs like If I Could Fall In Love, Yesterday Is Gone (My Dear Kay) and Dig In revive you from total monotony, the latter mainly the strongest and most noticeable melody.At first listen many, many months ago, I was ready to say goodbye and never listen to this CD again. I'm glad I didn't! Lenny actually has a bit to say unlike his rapper counterparts, although his lyrics, while mostly done by him aren't very amazing.His CD 5 and Mama Said are still better in my eyes, but this CD isn't too bad.72/100 points.end note: all of the tracks are slower tunes or mid-tempos so you may get bored the first time through (like I did) but give it a chance, especially if you're a fan."
4,A fine release from none other than Lenny Kravitz,"Usually when one buys a cd, it takes repeated listens to really digest the album. This is not the case with Lenny Kravitz's new release. When I popped this cd into my cd player, I liked each song immediately, and that isn't normal for me. The opening track ""Battlefield Of Love"" is a great way to open up an album, with incredible lyrics and a guitar riff that's incredible. Songs such as ""Yesterday Is Gone (My Dear Kay)"" And ""A Million Miles Away"" finds Lenny walking Beatles territory, which is cool because it suits his vocals real nicely. A great album for alternative rock lovers."
1,Too Many Problems With Chipset,"It sounded like a great card at a great price, but doing my own investigations after purchasing,and determined many issues with chipset. Crashes repeatedly during gaming. It might work for you but it hasn't worked for me."
2,"Nice price, but Part 1 is an edited version!","It's nice to see these films collected in a fairly cheap DVD set, but be advised, the original film is presented in an edited version which has cut scenes of gore and nudity. The old Media and Video Treasures VHS versions are the uncut version."
2,so bad its good....,"1 Ok so I hated the first one because it had a cliche predictable plot except for an end that was something I never would have expected.2 Not a horrible sequel. Maybe you can consider this an improvement over the first but it is still rather boring and uncreative.3 This is my favorite one of the series. It is actually pretty funny. The same killer, Angela, attacks people for no apparent reason with a log. It is so bad its good."
3,"Bad, but in a good way...","For anyone that likes cheesy 80's-90's horror movies. So bad they're good! The first Sleepaway Camp actually makes an attempt at being a serious horror movie, and does a decent job. The following two movies don't even try. They know what they are and they flaunt it: Entertaining but not scary, needs gratuitous topless scenes, typical early 90's horror. And there's nothing wrong with that!"
5,awesone product,"Finally a paint set where I don't have to worry about spills or messes! My kids were thrilled to receive this from ""Santa"" at Christmas. They love to paint but I have always discouraged it in the house. (We have a galley kitchen,and carpet in Dining room. Worried about the carpet.)Well no longer! They loved being able to paint and it kept them occupied for at least 20 minutes, and I didn't have to hover over them.I will admit that my youngest daughter did dig into her paint, and it is all gone. But she is learning to use it correctly with her older sister. I know we will be buying more in the future for more fun!"
2,"Cute, but not practical","These are cute and innovative looking nightlights, but mine stopped working after about 3 weeks. They need to improve the charger. Also, it was really hard getting the bottom off in order to put in the battery. It wasn't just me--I enlisted everyone who came over my house. Finally someone was able to sort of gnaw away at the bottom with a knife, which gouged the plastic. It's a great idea, but it needs work."
2,(2 1/2) Very Disturbing,"I listened to several Nevada Barr mysteries and was quite pleased with the content and flow of the story. However, the Hard Truth, though compeling, was very disturbing. I was not expecting such harsh and painful subject matter that by the end did not leave me (the reader) feeling that the character's issues were fully resolved. I was saddened throughout the novel once I discovered the truth about the little girls and the protagonist. This story is not for the faint of heart or the compassionate. This review is based on the audio book."
2,Not quite what I expected...,"The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book. I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it. Without those details, the book seemed ""unfinished"". It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain. Boring in my opinion."
2,Not the best,"I love the Anna Pigeon stories, but this one was a disappointment. The characters were disjointed, the continuity was poor....hard to say what happened here. Either avoid it, or borrow from the library instead of buying."
2,Not at all what I've come to love about Nevada Barr's books,"I have read every book in this series and this may be my last. I always try to keep the next book on my iPhone and can count on it for an interesting, breezy read when I have downtime. It was such a departure for her style and themes - where is Anna's support system? Paul? Molly? Why is this book going into deeply violent and disturbing crimes but treated more as a plot device? And what's with the polygamist theme on top of it? Oh and the national parks take a big step back in importance and context.I hate to write this review but honestly I was so surprised by my reaction to this book that it took me a while to realize how awful it is. Left a bad taste and I do really want to read more Nevada Barr."
3,Hard Truth for Ms. Barr,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon series until this one. Ms. Barr writes a good story, which is why I gave the book 3 stars. But, if this is the direction she is deciding to take in her work, I won't be reading any more of her books. The darkness of this story literally made me feel ill. I had nightmares the night I finished it. I want to be entertained by a good mystery, but I am not interested in books that present the kind of ""sickness"" found in this story. I know the world has it's share of darkness, but I'm not looking for this in my reading entertainment."
1,Horrific book,"I used to love Nevada Barr's Anna Pidgeon stories with their mix of mystery, self-reliance and outdoor adventure. But her latest book is just about the most horrible storyline I have ever read. Pedofilia, religious stereo-typing, sadism, torture, you name it, this book has it. I stuck it out until a few chapters from the end hoping someone would save the situation, but when one of the abused children was left to torture a bound Anna I tossed the book in the trash and never finished it. I read fiction for enjoyment and escapism, there is enough of this sort of horror in the daily news. I am crossing Nevada Barr off my book list, I can no longer trust her."
2,Shockingly Horrific,"As I began this book, I was hopeful I could disagree with the harsh criticism from some of the reviewers here. But, I can not. It is hard to believe this is the same author who gave us Track Of The Cat, Firestorm, and Blind Descent. The opening pages of this story were rather choppy. Awkward sentences and abrupt changes in scene made the story hard to follow. Then the writing evened out and the story became somewhat interesting until it neared the conclusion, which was shockingly horrific. Disgusting even. It isn't that I am overly sensitive to this sort of thing...I read Dean Koontz, Stephen King and other novels with plenty of horror in them. But I come to Nevada Barr's books expecting, needing something different. I hope this was an experiment and not a trend she intends to follow in future books."
3,How many lives does Anna have for crying out loud?,"OK, this isn't a spoiler because anyone who reads Anna Pigeon mysteries (mystery? I wouldn't call this a mystery) knows she has to survive. But she's getting close to 50. How much can one woman take in one book?!! I had to abandon my suspension of disbelief after a few of these incidents. Anna would have to be the bionic woman to have survived all she survived in this book. And I agree with the last reviewer. I'll stay away from more Nevada Barr books labelled as thrillers. I liked them better when they were mysteries."
2,Gratuitous and Explicit Violence,"I listened to this book on audio. Initially intrigued by the interesting setting, colorful heroines, and promising plotline, I spent much of the second half of the book grimacing. Gratuitous violence is a poor substitute for well-crafted suspense."
3,Nevada Barr drags Anna Pigeon down the wrong trail.,"""Hard Truth"" was so disappointing to a reader who has never missed one of Barr's books. Abandoning her talent for calling up the fascinating environs of many of the very different national parks and creating truly interesting characters and situations, she has joined the trend to creepy violence and horror--wonder if it was the result of ""market research"" or just frustration at seeing what makes the best seller lists? This book can't hold a candle to ""Blind Descent"" or ""A Superior Death,"" just to cite 2 examples. Not to mention the element of fantasy in Anna's being able to escape from one hopeless situation after another and overpower a younger, stronger maniac assisted by 3 adolescents turned demonic."
4,Moose was a great success,"This little moose was bought to replace a much loved soft toy which had been lost. As soon as he arrived he filled that hole in a small boy's heart and he hasn't missed a bedtime since. Very soft and, most importantly, easy to carry around (grab him around the neck), the moose has become the favourite toy."
4,Moose,I absolutely love this moose. Its super soft and definitely durable. I recommend this to parents for their kids or just random moose fanatics. You won't be disappointed.
1,"Not sure yet, but it appears to be working!","My 6 month old GSD female has done a number on the grass at my current rental. I have used Green Grass tablets for 2.5 weeks now and as far as I can tell, there are no new burn marks on the grass. I have seen no side effects with her either. Her coat is still shiny and her breath is still just as dogish as before.UPDATE: 1/13/11My dogs hair started falling out shortly after writing the above review. You couldn't touch her with out an handful of hair coming out on your hands! If it was July or August I wouldn't have been concerned but this was December! She also developed a huge sty on her right eye and she lost her eye lashes! I stopped this product immediately and within a week she stopped shedding and the sty was gone. Her eyelashes are starting to come back in."
1,Doesn't really address the problem - Nitrogen,"pH doesn't cause majority of the dead spots, it is nitrogen, and this product does nothing for nitrogen--in fact nothing can change the nitrogen content of urine, including tomato juice. Save your cash and buy some crushed lime. Turn the soil where the grass is yellow, sprinkle in lime, give it a lot of water, and re-seed."
3,Don't really see a difference....,"I have two dogs, a Black Lab puppy, and a Maltese-Poodle mix. I gave them a product from Drs. Foster and Smith previously, but decided that since my ""Ben"" was growing so much, so quickly, it would be worth it to get this one that has so many more tablets. I am 2/3 of the way through the container, and my lawn still has the brown spots on it. To be honest, none of them are from Ben, as we trained him to go on a mulched area off the lawn. It's all little Zoey. Maybe girl pee is different? I never miss a dose, and give it to Ben just to be safe, in case he should cheat. My brother, who is a scientist, laughs at the bottle every time he comes to my house. He swears it's one of the greatest wastes of money I've managed yet. He says you can't change the PH of the urine like it states to stop the burning. I don't know, but I'm going to at least finish this bottle up! Probably won't buy another."
2,Nothing against stubborn pastern dermatitis.,"I've been battling pastern dermatitis for more than five years now with my gelding. Products have come and gone that have provided him minor relief, but nothing cleared it up.This was no different.I used it as directed and treated diligently. I didn't expect miracles, and I didn't get any. It didn't worsen his condition or cause him any apparent discomfort, but it didn't provide any relief, either.It's far cheaper to use an alternative antibiotic product--even regular antibacterial hand soap has the same active ingredient as Krud Buster--for the level of efficacy offered."
4,Not A Copy,"Rage Against The Machine sounds a lot like Limp Bizkit and Limp Bizkit a lot like them, but they aren't copying each other. They just are 2 good bands who rock. The Battle Of Los Angeles is a must buy for a fan of either one of those bands."
1,monotone,"i got this album because i liked the songs ""testify"" and ""sleep now in the fire"" that i had heard on the radio. but the whole album sounds so much alike, each song like the next, that i cannot listen to it. i wish they would take more chances and experiment more."
3,How is this different from Evil Empire?,"I've been eyeing RATM since Evil Empire, my opinion being that they could be REALLY good if they sped stuff up, threw in some hip-hoppier beats, and really, shall we say, brought the noise. Early reviews I read made it sound like they went that direction with ""Battle"", so I picked it up. Still... so close to really good, but no cigar. I see next to no difference between this and Evil Empire. This may be a ringing endorsement for some, but not for someone like me, who had great expectations."
1,"Are their fans imoral, amoral, or just don't read the papers","Here we have a political band that thinks the Beatles ""If you're going to listen to Chairman Mao"" putdown was WRONG (check out senderro luminoso and an old spin profile - these guys are fans of Mao! Morello has also defended Sudan, a government that helps enslave Christian and other non-Muslims living in the south). Either anything short of Hitler is accepted these days, or fans don't care about politics if the music is good, or they don't get past the ""Free Mumia"" sloganeering as to what this band is about."
2,Where did the RAGE go?,Deserves 2.5 stars. This CD lacks the aggression and climatic song endings which were on the first two albums.
3,eh....,"this is not a bad purchase. there's nothing really bad on it, and there's nothing really great. the songs are good, but it is definitly lacking in originality. fans of the band will want it, first time listeners may not get the full effect of the band, and should buy something else. overall, its just generic"
3,Rage not what they used to be,"Alot of Rage fans are mad because they haven't really matured in there sound of music. (for examply Metallica has matured in their sound of music) and to listen to Evil Empire and then listen to this it really sounds like Rage did Evil Empire for the fans, and then did Battle of LA for the money. Not for the fans. Dont get me wrong it is an ok album, but not as good as their best album, which is Evil Empire."
3,RATM's lesser album,"As a fan of RATM, you can't say it's a bad product but it lacks the originality the first one has. Still, a couple of songs will blast you off your feet and make it worth listening."
5,musical genius,"There is no question that this is one of the most powerful and influential bands to come along in quite some time. The marriage of the rage of rap with the power of true rock can now be experienced through this brilliant work. Now speaking of brilliant works,doc in sale creek,TN: The only thing that you said in your review that was the least bit coherent was to buy the Beastie boys box set.As for U2 (who's older music I still appreciate) and politics,one only needs to see Bono performing at the White house FOR the president to see how far out of touch millions of dollars can put you.A word of advice, leave the reviews of serious music to the people that can understand the concept of artistic expression,namely people on the east or west coast.The last thing that I remember coming out of TN.was uh..... That guy that had the Beatles spied on by Nixon and Hoover,What was his name...oh yeah...elvis. NEED I SAY MORE?"
4,Great!,"I'm not a HUGE RATM fan, though I do own and enjoy all of their CDs. This disc, though, really seems to cover a lot more range than the other two. And, perhaps most importantly, is definetely some of Tom's best work. He might not be the best guitarist in the world right now, but he certainly is one of the most innovative. All in all, a great CD."
3,sneaking in the porn...,"Relevant, but shocking subject matter, plus out of the blue ""What the heck..."" ending. This film, almost 8 years old is undoubtedly innovative, which I appreciate. My fear is that Hollywood is chomping at the bit ready to stretch the boundaries of what censors and the mainstream American viewing public should be watching. As in ""The Piano"" where a lead actor is so young that they aren't allowed to view the finished product, one must question the moral aspect in terms of child abuse."
2,SLOW AND EMPTY . . .,. . . And all talk without much of a story. Right down there with Breillat's SEX IS COMEDY.
1,Pretentious junk!,"""Fat Girl"" is a nasty, boring, brutish movie by a director who clearly has nothing to offer other than shock. I've wasted time on two of her films now, and this will be the last.How novel: A European prize-winner has a repulsively violent ending, coming out of nowhere but laughably and clumsily foreshadowed throughout the rest of the movie. Who woulda thunk?It doesn't make a director deep simply if she makes cheap, obvious nihilism. Of course there are those ""sophisticates"" who think any hint of ambiguity in an ending is evidence of brilliance. Guess I'm not that soigne.And the spectacle of the obese young girl (who's seen clutching a stuffed animal in the making-of film) having to bare her [...] for a leering camera is one of the most distasteful things I've ever seen."
3,"Good price, average item","Received a red ""Mike"" train and coal tender. Never heard of that one, but it seems to be of good quality, made of wood and plastic. My son likes it.The video is one of the older ones w/ Ringo Starr. The production quality isn't as good as the more recent Thomas videos and Ringo is not one of the better narrators. He doesn't seem to have the warmth or the ability to keep the kids attention as well as others. It sounds like he is just reading a book out loud. Overrall, w/ the train, this is a decent value, but not great."
4,"excellent, but not enough to justify price","With only about 34:15 of music at Japanese import prices, this is a VERY expensive CD. If money is no object, then you need to get it now! If not, then you can wait. The beats are great, and I've got it on heavy rotation, but it's not quite worth the money."
3,"Good, but not that great.","I can understand why the CD is expensive (it's a Japanese import originally priced around $21), but even if we put all that behind, it is overrated. Production is really just OK, not to mention how short of each track is. Just for show."
3,Help me please,"I've saw Ghost Dog very many times. And since a very long time I am looking for the name of the kind of reggae song in the movie. The lyrics are kind of ""many people won't get supper tonight"" could someone please tell me what the name of this song is???"
1,Save Your Money,"Don't buy this book. Poor editing, poor code examples, faulty installation (or I should say, non-existent) guide for installing on Linux, are among the primary complaints."
2,Poorly writen but not bad.,"Was there actually an editor for this book? not one that knows anything about mysql, me thinks. the book did an excellent job of getting me started in mysql but in an unintended way. with so many typos in the code, i had to figure a lot of stuff out for myself. i learned how to read what the author meant instead of what was actually writen. however poor on the editing side, it is well organized and is a good tool to teach the typical db newbee. this is not, however, a good reference for the professional dba."
2,Disappointing,"I had read reviews of this book and was looking forward to reading it. It took me a 1/3 of the way into it to start to be interested, but then it sort of lost me. I kept reading hoping it would improve, but I felt it really fell short. A few funny parts and definately a ""chick book"" but not worth the effort overall."
3,bluetooth,"The Bluetooth WEP200 headset we purhased is average. It would be nice if the clip piece allowing you to hang it from your ear was more sturdy. It definitely feels flimsy on your ear. There are different sizes that go in your ear, but it wasn't a perfect match for us. The clarity is average as well. It definitely could have a clearer sound. There is a slight delay in the conversation. That is simply annoying.The place we ordered from was excellent. The shipping was fast and accurate. We probably would not recommend this produt to our friends or family."
1,Great features ...... if the device actually worked,"As a rule I always try to stay away from SMC products as from personal experience they have always given me grief. This product has such nice features I decided to give it a try. Alas, just like all the other SMC products I have tried previously, the router just freezes for no reason. I contacted tech support and they are well aware of the problem. They gave me some unreleased flash upgrade to try. It seemed much better after the update, but no cigar. As soon as I tried to print the device froze again. Save yourself much headache - stay away from this product."
2,puke!,"Pros: Nice looking, nice features (assuming they work), latest technology (early '05).Cons: EXTREMELY flakey/unstable.Like many reviewers, I owned the previous model. Completely stable, worked without any intervention. Always. Upgraded to this model and I've had trouble with peer2peer (router locks up with too much traffic, which was a problem with previous models). I've had trouble with wireless (router locks up with WPA or drops connections randomly). The only reason I've kept it and not gone back to an earlier model is laziness. This is changing now, as I've spent enough wasted time on these silly problems.Don't buy!"
5,"Excelent product, quick delivery",I've got the product in Brazil and I'm really glad that everything went fine. The product fits pretty good and the delivery was during the expected period.
4,Great Nail File,"I really like this nail file. It lasts forever and is much less likely to break nails than a metal file. My husband likes to come borrow it... it's that good. I'm docking one star because I would prefer it to be slightly less abrasive on one side enabling a totally smooth end. That being said, it does a great job and really hold up well over time."
4,"soppy,cute,gooey,mushy","Having described the film as all of the above , I still love this movie , even though I'm told its a 'chic flick' ! Salma Hayek and Matt Perry make a great duo , with Perry doing a 'Chandler' and Hayek being that loveable latin girl. This is your average romantic comedy , but hey , it reduced a guy like me to tears , well a little bit anyway !"
4,She loved it,My wife is Brazilian and has a hard time understanding English in movies but she enjoyed this movie very much. If you like romantic comedies we highly recommend this movie. Matthew Perry and Selma Hayek were great together.
4,Why no soundtrack???,"I really enjoyed this movie alot and the music is great, but why isn't there a soundtrack? - Anyone with an answer or at least a list of the songs? Thanks!"
5,SO GOOD!!!,"This movie was so romantic. I loved it, my husband really isn't into any romantic movies but he thought it was cute too. A must see."
5,SPECTACULAR!!,This movie was one of the best I have seen in a long time and left me in tears even though the plot doesn't call for it. I would sugest this film for someone who is looking for a fun romanctic movie that has an edge of realism.
4,Funny and Charming,"I have to say, As Hockey as this movie can be...It was very Funny and Charming. Selma Hayek reminded me of ME in this movie...Very cute love story..Grab a blanket and you Fav Person and Enjoy."
4,A Touching Love Story,"I have always been a fan of Matthew Perry, enjoying his great comedic timing. But Fools Rush In has always been a favorite of mine because it displays his tender side as well.Alex (played by Matthew Perry) meets Isabel (Salma Hayek) and have a one night stand. She disappears but returns 3 months later to announce that she is pregnant with his child. What transcends from here on end is an over-night wedding and a marriage which puts to the test their individual heritage. The challenges are many, but they each attempt to rise to the occasion as Isabel nears the birth of their child.I would especially recommend this to any couple who come from different backgrounds. It will touch your heart."
1,My dvd came severely damaged,The movie I received came damaged. The dvd case was severely cracked and the disc was loose inside the case.
5,Well worth adding to your autism library,"Very down to earth, educational, comprehensive and easy to follow. .I thought I knew an awful lot about autism, but this book has become a desk top reference for me.It's obvious these ladies know of what they speak.wtg, Jho and Dawn!"
3,"Good book, but not for Kindle","Other reviewers have dealt well reviewing the book, so I will comment only on it's format for Kindle. It's not acceptable. There is no Table of Contents. There are no links. None. There are several charts which don't work at all. And the style of the book, with no separations or inconsistent separations between paragraphs, is very unpleasant and crowded.If you are willing to work around those problems, the material in the book may be helpful. I am considering returning this because I believe it is unwise to give economic incentive to producers of poorly adapted e-books, especially considering the limitations of e-books."
2,A Strange Turn of Events,"Bounce (PG-13)- I either love or hate Gwyneth Paltrow and in this movie I loved her. But alas, I can't say the same for the movie itself. How Don Roos, the acidic genius of The Opposite of Sex could have written this drivel is beyond me. Ben Affleck proves yet again that he has taken over Richard Gere's reign as the most over rated heart throb working in Hollywood. Quite a feat given that Mr. Gere is still making movies! We have seen this story a million times and there is nothing entertaining or original enough this time around to keep you from doing anything but wait for the predictable last reel to finally thread up."
4,chick flick girls!,"I saw this with the thought in my mind ""Stinko""! But I actually really enjoyed it. It had good acting and a great cast. I am thinking about adding it to my collection!"
1,This movie was bad,"I don't know what people are thinking about when they give this movie five stars. After watching the trailer you would have known everything that happens in the movie except the last 10 minutes, which are easy to predict. The movie should have gone more into his alcoholism or deeper into her life after her husband died, so we would get to know the characters more. It seems they just put out a short film with big name stars they knew would make a buck. I don't think they ever intended this movie to be any good at all. It is a shame because both actors have a lot of potential.D"
2,Romantic eye candy.,"This really isn't a bad movie at all. It's actually very touching at a lot of points. The plot comes full circle and leaves you with that warm fuzzy ""love conquers all"" message.Affleck and Paltrow work very well together. Their off-screen romance seems to penetrate into the acting.Not bad. Good one to see with the girlfriend/wife."
1,I was forced into watching this one.,I wanted to see a Schwarzenegger movie but I always take my girlfriend to see action movies so I figured I'd be nice and take her to this one. Big Mistake. We both hated it but at least it provided some nap time.
3,Just Bounce,"Don Roos, who's excellent work in film include Directing and writing ""The Opposite of Sex"", writing ""Boys on the Side"" and producing ""All Over the Guy"" delivers a sweet film for his second directorial effort. Gwyneth and Ben are great as lover's who's lives crossed in the aftermath of a planecrash which he should have been on, and she lost a lover to. The film improves upon it's premise with excellent dialogue and acting. The DVD edition is beautifully rendered and includes a great directors commentary, and some extended or deleted scenes that don't specifically add anything to the movie. A sweet, light romance movie."
3,Not really for Developers,An interesting enough background history of DNN with a bit of technical information thrown in and put into context. But don't buy this book if you expect it to help you build your own modules.
2,A mediocre recording of classic musical,"I was very excited when I bought this recording, but the experience of listening to it was disappointing. Caroline O' Conner stands head and shoulders above the rest of the cast as Anita on this recording, while Tinuke Olafimihan makes a charming, through sometimes shrill, Maria. But Paul Manuel as Tony has an irritating hardness in his voice, one that does not suit Bernstein's lyrical score or the romanticism of the character of Tony. The rest of the supporting cast tries hard to create a spontaneous and energetic atmosphere, but doesn't quite succeed. This recording falls flat - rather stick to the stunning Original Broadway Cast, which is available from Amazon."
5,Great Costume,I bought this for my film class for which I needed to remake a part from Friday the 13th and this mask looked pretty good in it... This mask really does fit anyone and any size head because the mask has a stretchy band that goes around your head. This is one of the best masks around and pretty cheap especially with the machete that came with it.
3,A good anthology is hard to find,"I chose this anthology of short stories by default. I facilitate a literature group, and other anthologies had already been read by most of the members. It's OK and so far has provoked lively discussion. I find the editors' selections a bit perplexing, though. And I would recommend choosing a more recent anthology."
3,Sunshine hurts performance,This is basically a good camera if you shoot only indoors or in cloudy conditions. The display is absolutely useless in strong light and only passable the rest of the time. That means that the cool feature of Stitch Assist is unuseable unless you are in dim light since you need to see the display clearly in order to line up the images. Very Dissappointing!!!! When using this camera I found that I had to look through the viewfinder more often than not in order to get a look at how the photo would shape up. Not what I expected when I invested in my first digital camera.Buyer beware of how you intend to use this camera before buying.
4,Pretty good!,"I'm very happy with this camera. The video feature comes out to a nice size on my 15 inch screen, it covers about 1/3 of the screen. The pictures are nice, too, and cover my whole screen.My only complaint is that nighttime pictures/video require a lot of lighting. I took a video in a dim room and it was grainy, and a picture I took at night blurred. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.However, overall it is a wonderful purchase!"
3,Handy Camera with Contrast Issues,"The price is right, it has lots of features and a strong review from Consumer Reports.Unfortunately I bought this camera before a mountain trekking trip and it did a poor job shooting severe light contrast. In other words, pretty much any scene with snow either washes out on the bright end, or underexposes dark objects in the frame (people, landscape, etc.).Get this camera if you're going to use it for indoor shooting, normal outside lighting conditions, etc."
4,Not bad,"I like this camera, all things considered. I am only a casual photographer, so the fact that it makes it easy to take good pictures is excellent for me. I think that the menus are well thought-out and a lot of fun to play around with. My only complaint is that my camera eats batteries; I usually get to use the camera on one event per set of charged batteries. It's really annoying because it doesn't show battery status until they're almost dead. Other than that, great camera."
3,The best is the price,"Is a very good camera on the day, but on the nigth take a bad pictures sometimes see like moved.."
5,Very Happy,"I got this camera as a baby shower gift. I needed a camera that was quick and easy to use. When you're taking pictures of the funny things kids do, you have to be quick. This camera is exactly what I needed. Once I spot the kids doing something funny, I have time to turn the camera on and get the picture before they even realize they're in the spotlight. It has a great zoom and red-eye protection. I am really happy with the quality especially for the price."
4,Very nice for the price,"I've had this camera for about 4 months. It takes great pictures and has more than enough ""bells and whistles"" for the average point and shoot photographer (me). The only ""bad thing"" about it is operation is not intuitive, other than the on/off switch and zoom. You'll have to get into the manual to learn the functions."
3,First kindle read,It wasn't quite what I expected. I thought it would be for younger children. I would recommend this book to parents that have teenagers.
3,ok,It was an ok read. I disagreed with some things but that could just be the way i was raised or my beliefs of my religion. On the up side I got it pretty quickly.
5,Excellent Book!!!,This is definitely a must read for any parent or prospective parent. This book has helped transform my wife and I from the traditional way of parenting to actually taking me back to my childhood when parents really didn't allow children to have a voice. These 5 critical needs are essential to the building of a child's self esteem while allowing the parents to see themselves and some of the mistakes that we don't realize we're making. Thank you Dr. Newmark for opening the eyes of millions of parents around the world!!!
1,THE WORST GAME EVER!,"The game is so dumb. You are in a graveyard in your underpants and a giant red monster comes to steal your girlfriend. Mr. Knight finds his armor (laying next to the picnic?!) and then faces an endless amount of zombies. Mr. Knight's controls are about equal to me trying to order my 2 yr old sister around. The enemies are just big enough to be unable to jump over, and the ending was too crude. Don't buy it."
5,Brilliant,"This is one of those things that just works exactly how it should with no hassle. The wireless unit is extremely accurate, the information displayed is easy to understand, the radio is clear, the time projection is legible without being too bright and it looks good."
2,"Don't expect to hear Om kolthoum, she's not on it!!!","The music is great, but I bought it in the hopes of hearing her wonderous voice."
5,Race With The Devil,"I first saw this movie when I was a kid, of 11, My parents didn't think it was too scary so they let me watch it. Race With The Devil has become one of my favorite scary movies. Even if you have seen this movie a million times and you know what's coming and how it ends, you will STILL get the knot in your stomach waiting for the end. I know I do, I know what's coming and I STILL get the tension knot in my stomach. This is just a really good scary movie, in my opinion."
5,Works Great,I have 2 of these and they work great. They are ideal if you do alot of repeat cuts. I have no flex in mine as frames come out true.
3,"Enjoyable, but predictable.","Book 10 in the Elm Creek Quilter's series. This one goes back in time to the 1920s and the depression years in California. Like the other books, it involves an ancestor of Sylvia Compson, and like all her other ancestors, this woman quilts. Chiaverini has a nice formula. She writes about quilting, family, women and relationships and ties it all together with facts about quilting and patterns.I enjoyed this novel, although not as much as I've enjoyed some of her others. This one was a very fast read. Enjoyable, but somewhat predictable. I was almost able to skim it and still enjoy the plot and characters. Elizabeth and her husband are taken by a con artist and purchase a farm that doesn't exist. They swallow their pride and work for the family who owns the property. I like Elizabeth's strength and her faith in herself and her husband. If you've enjoyed the Elm Creek series, you will enjoy the book. It's not a necessary read to further the series though."
4,Tracing Elizabeth's past,"This book traces the early married life of Sylvia's adored older cousin, Elizabeth. It tells of her courtship with Henry, their wedding, and long honeymoon trip to California where they hoped to take possession of Triumph Ranch, which Henry had purchased. Things do not go as expected and they soon become employees of the ranch's owners. Their story is interwoven with the story of the Rodriguez family, who originally owned the ranch. Family feuds, hidden loves, and hardships are all parts of this latest book in the Elm Creek Quilts series. Author Chiaverini weaves the stories of the two families together as deftly as the ladies who create the quilts in the book. This is a welcome addition to this series."
2,Charlie Brown Christmas without Linus? Hmmmmm,"I bought these figures, thinking they were Christmas ornaments. I was a bit surprised that they had clip on key ring attachments. No problem, simply remove the key rings and put ornament hangers on them.These ""ornaments"" would be great bits of nostalgia, except they forgot to include Linus. They include a piano, but no Linus. Imagine, a Charlie Brown Christmas with nobody to play the carols.All in all, they rate a 2 for the silly key rings and no Linus. If marketed as ornaments and had a Linus, they would get 5 stars!"
4,A must have!,This is a must have book for young adults getting ready to graduate high school! It tackles many issues facing us in the real world!
5,The Complete Malory,This is the complete works of Thomas Malory in the English language he wrote it in. This is NOT the English that the modern reader can read and understand easily. These volumes come with notes that help the reader understand the text. I use these volumes as a backup to a modern translation- looking up certain pages to get the feel of the 'real' Malory. These volumes are out of print and expensive so that purchase of this set is something a reader has to ponder.
5,an honest book from a very honest writer,"Lillian Too says on the book cover that she simplifies feng shui to make it easy and accessible. I read this book and found she delivered on this promise. I am therefore happy to recommend this book very highly. many tips, though simple worked. I am surprised but pleased."
5,what's not to like,"I haven't had a chance to watch all three of these movies; but, I've never seen a really bad movie with these stars to entertain us."
1,SO uncomfortable and not safe!,"We bought this a few months ago for our 1 year old daughter. I had an off brand carrier with my son and loved it, so I thought this would be even better. Wrong. My shoulders ache 5 minutes after putting it on. Even my husband, who is strong and has a high pain tolerance, can't wear it for longer than 30 minutes.Because my daughter's feet can reach the bottom of the frame, she tends to stand up and wiggle out of the straps. I hate that I'm constantly having to tell her to sit down. I listed it on Craigslist and I'm going to purchase something different."
5,Awesome Book!,Such a great book. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to grow deeper with God.
4,Food for Thought,Rob makes a great case for merging the physical and the spiritual. It's about much more than just our sexuality in relationship to our spirituality. Good book for challenging a small group to think through the ramifications of traditional thought systems.
5,Sex is human and spiritual,Rob Bell is amazing plain and simple. This book helped me see how I can love myself and be happy with who I am and embrace my sexuality as a spiritual practice not just a human one.
1,Very suspect. I will not read.,What the?!!! How low have we sunk to accept something like this into Christianity? Not exactly a sermon that Paul would preach. Guard your hearts and your minds and stay away from these 'super-stars.' Our children are drowning in a hyper-sexualized society and this kind of crud is horrible! You can't justify this. Shame on the followers!
4,Not as good as Gounod's Faust,"This was a bit of a dissapointment for me; the sound was OK, but could have been better (however, it IS a recording from the '30's, so maybe I forgive it).Margerite is a bit weak...Otherwise, the music is great.Not as good as Gounod's Faust though!!!"
2,Way too many mistakes!,"Tech books often have mistakes. This one is unbelievable. This book feels more like learning via the gauntlet. You learn by double checking everything in this book against other sources.It's too bad, I like the outline of the book, how it layers information in progressive steps. It's just too often bad info. And the Cisco errata sheet is a one page joke. Do not use this book as your only source.Please note the one positive review here is reviewing the ICND book, not Intro."
1,DONT BUY THIS BOOK,"I've been working as a network engineer primarily using Adtran equipment for quite a few years. I'm moving more into the Cisco spectrum and decided to get my CCNA just because. This book is the biggest waste of money ever. While it does give you an idea of Cisco's obscure wording of questions/answers, the rest is absolute junk. There are so many wrong answers, grammatical mistakes, and missing answers that this book should have never made it to market. If I wasn't sure I needed to pick up another book, I would probably fail this test. WHAT A WASTE CISCO! I want a refund!"
