2,Save your money!,"The accordian folds in the bowls need improvement. Firstly, my S/O could not get the bowls to open all the way. I got it open okay, but when I put medium temperature leftover chile into it, that 6-cup folded just like a cheap suit into a 4-cup. Was that by design? I don't know. It held 4-cups of chile. Perhaps that is the design - shrink to fit?Washing the bowl in hot water did the same shrinkage. A 6-cup bowl shrinks to 2-cups and I had to wrestle open to clean the ridges.Save your money on this one.Good idea, but it doesn't work so well."
4,Too collapsible,"All in one versatile use. Very nice width and lid to conform to each collapse. Goes from freezer/refrigerator to microwave nicely and hasn't stained yet. The negative....it collapses too easily. The lid is difficult to snap on and on pressing the lid on, the bowl collapses. For those of you with hand difficulties and limitations, I would not recommend this product. Otherwise is a very innovative product."
1,0 for 1,"I lost all trust for this book, the first request I sent out came back ""Return to Sender- Address Unknown"", I won't waste any more time with it, it's going in the trash tomorrow, it would have been quicker to flush money down the toilet then to buy this book!!!"
4,CPQ V2402US,"I have found this to be a very dependable machine (as have been all of my HP/CPQ computers. You will want to upgrade the RAM to a minimum of 512 from the installed 256, as it really has to strain to perform with the minimal standard. That upgrade will cost you max $50.The screen is absolutely gorgeous, and the support features HP has put on as standard are very nice. It is a shame that there is no meaningful manual that comes with it, but setup and operation is very simple.Attractive, comfortable to work on, and light enough to be very portable."
2,discover it - before you buy,"I didn't want a pictorial illustration of black farming. I wanted to learn more history. Was disappointed in my expectations, but if you manage your expectations right, you probably will like this book!"
2,A fluff piece...,"I love Yee's videos, but this book I can do without. Too much fluff, and I really didn't care about the the conversations with his student, Nina Zolotow. Yee's and Zolotow's ""insights"" added nothing to the book. The photos are good at illustrating asanas, but he uses the same basic ones throughout the book, for almost every chapter. As a yoga instructor, I refer to many yoga books for reference, but this one is staying on my coffee table for eye candy. The book is strictly for beginners."
1,Not Impressed,"This product got good reviews on another site, so I tried it.I used it twice. Both times it made my skin feel dry. I saw no noticeable improvement.Won't use again. The jar is just taking up space now in the bathroom."
4,Buju is TOO BAD :),"Buju, Gargamel music!!!!That boastful voice and full of energy, he knows how to set the stage and make you feel hype while listening to this album. I miss his music and hopes he can come out with something new sometime soon. Miss you Gargamel!!!But when I am in that mood I just put him in and let my waist do the talking..lol"
5,buju's #1 FAN,BUJU is like NO OTHER. many have tried but ALL have failed. he is undoubtedly THE BEST.. anyone who KNOWS reggea KNOWS it can't exist without BUJU.... his SEXY RAUNCHY voice just makes it all worth while..he WILL ALWAYS BE #1.......
4,Black Jack and Texas Holdem a Family Affair,"I purchased this to replace a version of ""Royal Rummy"" I purchased in the 1950s in England that had stood the test of time. This version is certainly equivelent in entertainment value. Our whole family enjoyed it! We played with adults and kids. All had a great time. It is entertaining but not demanding on either skill or mental concentration. Just perfect for a family night. However the poor quality of the playing cards-they do not shuffle or deal easily, and the low quality felt in the mat, make it certain it will not survive a couple of years let alone 50! But I suppose nobody should expect that from any product today.. Overall though a good choice for any household of adults that like to play table games, entertain kids, and still hold a conerversation without too much strain. A good buy at the price..Ted Ohio"
2,Not what I expected!,"This book's sub-title is a bit misleading as there wasn't a focus on truly severe weather. I purchased this hardback to add to my collection of tornado-related items, but found the chapter addressing that topic disappointingly brief. There are interesting nuggets of weather wisdom in these pages, but they must be ferreted out of the lyrical whimsy and random personal recollections that make up the bulk of this book. I think Mr. Pinder meant well, but someone at Tarcher/Putnam ""twisted"" (pardon my pun) things a bit for marketing's sake. Maybe if they had called it ""Mount Washington's Wild Worst Winter Weather Wonderland""........."
2,Unreadable for me,"Generally I'm really fascinated with tales of adventure, weather, and Mt. Washington. But I really couldn't read this book because of the overbearing prose style. Honestly, I returned it to the library after struggling through a couple of chapters.Mr. Pinder fancies himself a poet, but what is needed here is a plainspoken storyteller. Lines like ""the stars don't speak"" are not beautiful or enlightening, just annoying."
2,Where was the editor of this book?,"This book was written with no table of contents in mind. It rambles. Seriously rambles. Some of his anecdotes are entertaining but you can literally open this book at any page and begin reading there. There is no beginning, middle, or end. After a while, it just stops. At least two thirds of this book has nothing to do with Mt. Washington but is anecdotes of his weather experiences throughout his life. Some images are quite pretty and poetic but I kept waiting for some structure to the book. Very disorganized and disappointing to me."
1,Awful!,"Rarely have I had the misfortune to read such a poorly written book. The author has put together an astonishing collection of trite and unoriginal descriptions of-what should have been-interesting weather phenomena. The writing is so flowery that if you were to eliminate all adjectives you would most likely be left with a book of less than ten pages. Hidden amongst the fluff is the occasional nugget of information, but it is quickly buried again lest the reader actually learn something.An example: ""If you grope for wind with your hand, it dodges and swivels, so that instead of catching the slippery essence of the atmosphere, you come up instead with a fistful of nothing. Wind wistles and mutters in a soft language full of vowels and sighs; it says little that we understand. The wind is alive but alien; it refuses to answer our questions, but asks many of its own.""Honestly, have you ever heard such drivel?"
2,"Anemic, Disappointing, Could Have Been Better","I've listened to this album for about an hour, listening to all offered songs. My first impression is that it's not a true quartet--they have slight percussion, and a guitar is featured on a couple of the songs for some reason. The bass instruments are much too loud and overpower the high-pitched instruments. These compositions would have been fabulous with a full orchestra; with only four instruments and no intricacy whatsoever, you basically have two sets of duets. It makes for a highly uninspiring, yawn-worthy album. I've heard better at a crafts fair. I am a voracious Evanescence fan but at its heart this CD is only vaguely Evanescence-inspired; it has very little to do with the band's music other than the melody and half-hearted accompanyment by four not particularly talented musicians."
1,ugh..,"absolutely horrible--instrumenets blare off-key and out of time.lack of vibrato makes the lines fall flat, not to mention that there are huge gaps in the layers of harmonies that glare at the listener.Don't waste your money on this."
4,String Quartet,"I found this album to br a true dissapointment, as their previous albums Fallen and Anywhere but home where filled with emotion and the strong lead vocals of Amy Lee, i found this CD stale and emotionless but if you are a fan of evanescence and a fan of classical music then this is the album for you"
1,Definately NOT worth it,"I bought this not long ago - being a musician on-the-side, I love listening to symphonic and string arrangments of rock music. But I was sorely dissappointed with this. It is poorly mixed, and it is musically mediocre (bad timing, bad tuning, bad styling). There's almost a hollowness to it - it evokes no emotion. It simply does not do justice to the symphonc beauty and power of Evanescence's music - rather, it sounds like a cheap knock off arrangement performed by a bunch of junior-high schoolers. Seriously - do yourself a favor and steer clear."
3,could be better,This cd was okay.It could be better though.The sound is off and it doesnt sound like real strings playing.If you LOVE rock do not buy.you will most likely hate this.but if you like new things check it out.I personally thought it wasnt too good since i play violin but it wasnt a waste of my money.
1,Warning: Buy At Own's Risk!,"Seriously, I don't know what this quartet is contemplating, but this is a horrible album. Some things in this world are not meant to be. One of them is that classical intruments imitating rock, heavy metal intruments. If you're going to do proper and correct, follow in the light of artists like Vanessa Mae with her electric violin or the female quartet who has electric instruments mixing with electric percussions and digial music to emulate the pop/heavy metal music.This album is like the well-respected maestro Pavarotti singing rap in his tenor voice! Can you imagine such absurdity? Or better yet, rap/hip hop artists like OutKast or 50 Cents singing opera!!!Somes things in this world are never meant to be. Period!"
1,EVANESCENCE has a tribute album?,WTF?! They've only had like 3 hits and they only have 1 album out...
2,Listen to the previews yourself,"Evanescence's music does not have a clearly distinguishable melody. The drums, chorus and guitar each add to the style of the piece - something that strings seemingly cannot do. Plainly put, the String Quartet Tribute just sounds like a bunch of violins not in concert with a distinguishable melody heard here and there. It does not have the dynamics of the original song. It is naturally hard for violins to play loud or soft accordingly. And since there are only about five musicians, the music almost sounds ""flat."" But your best opinions is yours. Listen to the previews and decide for yourself."
5,A Great Read,"Great story that is a refreshingly honest portrayal of the conflict between the environmental movement and humanity. The book is entertaining but at the same time informative. The author portrays each side fairly. It makes a person think about the value of human life and nature.This is the first book I have read by this author. Hopefully the book comes to the attention of the general public, it deserves to."
1,Which Guitar fits this case?,"I bought this for my son. He has a Fender acoustic guitar. The guitar did not even come close to fitting in the case. Tried another guitar, that did not fit either. Maybe better marketed as a violin case!!!"
5,Excellent value!,"I have purchased dozens of items through Amazon, and this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. To anyone considering this guitar case; I can only say, buy with confidence. You will not find a better case (in new condition) for $40. It is solidly built, my guitar fits perfectly (remember it is made for a classical guitar so it is a litle smaller that a regular acoustic guitar case), and the shipping was very fast. Overall an excellent value."
2,Boring,"Bought for Christmas for 9 year old son... he didn't seem thrilled and several days after Christmas finally opened it... watched the video (which I thought was good, it kept his attention) and he practiced the tricks along with it for a total of up to an hour. He hasn't played with it since. Hopefully he will again, someday. (He might have liked this more if living in the age before darn video games, thanks Playstation & Nintendo.)"
5,Magic fun,I fun and great gift . good for the kids putting on a magic show for other people. it gives kids a lot of confidence in front of people
4,Decent value,"Has a nice big bright LCD screen.Zoom occurs in eight rapid ""click-stop"" stages, not smoothly like more expensive camcorders.After pushing the ""ON"" button, this camcorder is ready to go in about four seconds.There's a threaded hole on the bottom for tripod placement.There's no lens cover included, and since the lens is almost flush with the body of the unit, there's no way to use one.Unit has a flat bottom, but with the LCD screen pivoted open, unit become ""left-heavy"" and will tip over."
2,Silly and fussy writing,"I have been reading Peter Dickinson's books for 20 years and with the exception of the last two have enjoyed and appreciated them all. But SOME DEATHS...reads as if written by some fussy, silly old British upper middle class woman who hasn't had any outside communication since 1959. The pace is deadly slow and just dull at times as the narrative winds forward and back in time and from one annoying character after another. Between daughter Flora nattering on and on to saintly nurse Dilys and stiff-upper dead Jocelyn, not one character has any originality or life. This is a very disappointing book when compared with TEFUGA or A PERFECT GALLOWS. Read the earlier novels to understand was an excellent writer Mr. Dickinson really is."
1,You might like this album but you should know the truth...,"Even the Amazon ""review"" has inaccurate information concerning this album. The statement from Glenn Frey was not said about the people who recorded this album. Not a single one of them were part of the original Little River Band. Glenn Frey said that about Glenn Shorrock, Graeham Goble, Beeb Birtles, and Derek Pellicci. These guys are a completely different lineup. They were not present on any of these songs on the original recordings with only one exception that of Wayne Nelson singing on ""Night Owls"".If you want to hear the original Little River Band, look for Birtles, Shorrock, & Goble or make sure that any CDs you buy were originally recorded from 1975 to 1981 (Little River Band, After Hours, Diamantina Cocktail, Sleepcatcher, First Under The Wire, and Time Exposure. After 1981, there were five more albums with one or two of the principal players missing, but hey all feature the fine songwriting of Graeham Goble."
3,Passable blacklight,"I purchased this blacklight to track down cat pee and spray in our basement. It was somewhat effective but not as good a tool as I had hoped. The blacklight is quite small and does not put out a lot of light. I did find some cat pee I was not aware of, but in general I found the light to be fairly weak even in near complete darkness. I am not sure if a brighter backlight would have helped my cause."
3,"It's ok, but you have to be VERY close!","It's a decent product, but if you want to use the blacklight for seeing stains, you have to literally be within inches of anything. I actually bought this for viewing longwave fluorescent minerals, and you have to be very close to the object to see anything...almost touching it. The ""torch"" is fine, it's one LED and it can illuminate a book or something, but you aren't going to walk around at night with the light. For the price, it's ok, but not powerful in the least."
4,Good Message,"Once you get over the arrogance of the author's bragging that he ""invented"" execution (they seem to the think the world's leaders have gone eons without execution) the book is very good.Good points and pertinent examples. You will be very busy reflecting on how you are performing in similar situations. My industry is nothing like the examples given but the points were just as relevant."
4,Muy buen libro,"Un libro muy ameno que muestra cómo una organización puede alinearse en post de un objetivo común, hacer las cosas bien, sin lugar a dudas, un libro que hay que leer"
2,Not Innovative,"I guess after reading From Good to Great, I read this book, and it was a major disappointment. Where Good to Great gave you data and a ton of great examples from many companies, this book gave you their personal examples, and no data. If you are in the top two bands at a Fortune 100 business, this might help. But for the rest of us, I would recommend other books.Also, for those who are looking for a roadmap, this book does not have it. It provides very general guidance."
1,Terrible!,"This is an incredibly bad book. Frankly, it's amazing that it ever got published in the first place.One only has to read the gushing superlatives with which the authors write about many of the worlds worst CEO's to realize that they know very little about the real world. The book has very little pragmatic advice about how to 'execute'. When tips and tricks are discussed, they are often precisely what NOT to do when attempting to run a successful business."
1,This is a terrible way to manage your employees.....,This is a terrible way to manage your employees.....leadership is about coaching and development of people. Not how to make them listen to your every request.
2,"Ironicly, This book is poorly executed","I listened to this book via CDROM. It is ironic that the 2 executives who speak of execution produced a product barely worthy of it's name. Many of the case studies didn't have a meaningful conclusion. The writing is at many times ""not cohesive"" The use of too much long-winded jargon fails to make a point sometimes. I found the narration of executive letters to be difficult to listen to because names, companies, and projects were changed to the point where it was not relatable. I think this is one of those books where the administrative assistant wrote the book on company time."
3,A series of essential but banal truth,"This books builds on the fame of the authors, but tells nothing more than a series of banal truths. For the one looking for execution techniques, this book will not give any new insight. On the other side, a manager that will miss one of the ""pillars"" here presented, i.e. the people process, the strategy and the operation, or to establish the link between them, will inevitably fail in the longer term. The book is easy to read, and might be useful for beginners to avoid banal mistakes."
3,"For a book in Execution, They never get around to Executing","I bought the book, eager to learn how to execute. It starts out with the premise tht the best laid plans will never succeed without someone actually making sure it's done. In they're opinion, the CEO must be the one to do it. An interesting premise and one worth exploring. Unfortunately, this book never delivered. Instead, it is packed with stories and reminiscences about how great some people are and why isn't everyone that way. It uses specific genralities to stay that it's important to be honest and realistic in the business world.Duh! There's nothing new in it, and especially nothing for those mid-level people who want to succeed.Other books are much better."
3,"A lot of good material, but hard to read","This was a very good book. Having a perfect strategy gets you nowhere if you can't execute it. The authors go through why execution is so important and how to improve your execution. Concrete ideas in how to do strategy sessions and planning are included.There's a lot of material packed in, so I found it a difficult read. I'm glad I read it, but I'm also glad I'm done with it. I expect to get more out of it someday when I read it again. Don't expect to get through this book in less than 3 weeks. As good as it is, it's also very tiring to read."
2,Nothing new,"Listened to the audio version and found it to be generally a waste of time. Very few legitmate new ideas or takeaways. Almost exclusively aimed at very large organizations. In addition, Bossidy sounds like Rick Moranis's accountant character in ""Ghostbusters"" and Ram Charan has such a thick Indian accent that I found him difficult to understand. Not recommended."
1,Interesting Book,"When this book is read in conjunction with ""Good to Great"" and ""Built to Last"", the messages contained in the book are much easier to understand."
1,"At best uninspiring, at worst contradictory and flippant...","Without substance.Like listening to a couple blow hards boast about how effective they are.Uninspiring.And most annoying, this book is arrogantly contradictory. You're reading along, and just as you think you might be reading a worthwhile and helpful point, the book flip-slops to an opposite point. ""One must never micromanage"" to ""one must never be a delegating-type manager."" Or, ""have humility, but be decisive.""In the end, the translation to this corporate manager reader is this: do whatever you want, pretend to have noble intentions, and always justify your actions with an ""execution"" spin.Very unimpressive."
2,There is an execution method - it's called project managment,"The authors make a compelling argument but, as I kept reading deeper into the book, I realized that what they were touting as a new management philosophy is actually established project management principles. Linking strategic objectives to work outcomes, communicating with stakeholders, and so on - this is all covered in any halfway decent book on project management. At least if you have a CEO who is gungho on ""execution"" after reading this book, then introduce them to project management and you will be the corporate hero."
4,"""Burn out""",Burn out paradise besides the roaming part this game is awesome just make sure you dont go on the train tracks or it will take you a while to get back on the road even though its kinda enjoyable cause there is small jumps you can do on the train track.I like the new additions which is the stunt run and marked man. You also get unlocked cars by doing races and so on but you have to chase them and take them down that was the fun part.The music is pretty cool and it is a nice selection. There is one thing i do miss from previous burn outs just the fact that you dont have two player racing and being able destroy vehicles and everything else in town to compete for cash for me was kind of a downer but everything else is way Awesome. Overall i give this game a five star for its awesomeness in game play graphics and for just being burnout.
3,"Glad to have it, but it could be better","I loved a great many things about this game; the revamped style of an open world where races are begun at specific intersections, and the massive Showtime wrecks are much more fun than in the older games. I didn't even think those large wrecks could get any better! However, it could be much more user friendly. Controls aren't explained in great detail, the map is hell compared to the older games, and (while a small complaint) you'll have to hear GNR's Paradise City almost in its entirety by the time the game loads. All in all, it is better than decent. It looks and plays very, very well. But it isn't without its pitfalls and won't be found on my list of memorable gaming experiences."
3,just drive faster here,"its a good game, i enjoy with my friend its good product and fun game and easy to play. thank you so much"
4,Burnout Paradise,Very fun game. Lots of races and extra content. Kept me interested for a long while. Wasn't too difficult as the past burnouts were. But overall a good game and lots of fun.
3,Lack of split screen kills this game,"After playing the demo I was sure this addition to the Burnout series would be great. After playing the game at a friends house after the release date all I can say is ""no split screen?"". What made revenge so great was the takedown mode and playing it with friends or at a party. The lack of not even being able to enjoy this game with someone next to you is well... sad. Even in the age of online gameplay being a must, being able to play with people in the same room is just as important as any other feature if not more. Shame on you EA."
3,Burnout Paradise Land!,"Burnout Paradise is typically a game in which you are a driver in Burnout Paradise Land. The controls are easy, so it shouldn't be a problem. But the overall thing that won me over was the graphics, very realistic! Though, there were some downs. The car or motorcycle you were driving in would always fall off if you were close to the edge. Also, the game is very hard, very bad difficulty settings. The game did not give you many choices of what type of car you wanted. I'd say, try this game out before you buy it!"
1,biger is not better,"wll this game looks amazing but thats all,the people that gives this game 5,4 or even 3 stars evidentli dont like to get ther moneys worth.this game is a big disapointment to all burnout fans,lets start by sayn crach mode is gone,you have to drive like a retard all over the city and stop at a street light to get on a race,takedown and other shep tipes of raaces.It had the potential to be a great game but it didnt even came close to it.Dont make the same mistake that i did and buy this doungrade of a great game,just wait for grran turismo 5 that would be a better bet."
4,Burnout Goes Global,"Burnout is no longer a set of linear races, but a huge open world that is fun to explore, but easy to get lost in. There is no restart button for races, but a new event is right around the corner. And if the ""promotional code"" is still being offered, don't hold your breath for it. I didn't get one."
3,IRWIN 318015,"This is indeed a homeowner bit set. My husband does home repairs for a living and would not buy the set. He did say the ""list"" price was just silly and pointed out that Lowes has an 18 piece set w/a 1/2"" bit and driver bit also included for a bit more than the current price, i.e. under 20 bucks. So this suggested list price is way thru the roof! Not a good idea to judge your shopping by that w/o first seeing what that product sells for on other sites."
4,No Doubt fans will love this DVD,"Aside from a vast array of every music video spanning No Doubt's career, the special features alone are well worth it. The menus are much better done than the videos collection dvd that came with Boom Box. I really enjoyed the ""Bathwater"" re-mix video. The video itself is different from the original, using different shots, editing and takes. The alternate version of the ""Don't Speak"" video was interesting. This version is 100% concert footage instead of the original version having scenes of the band members acting out their frustration towards Gwen. I loved the behind the scenes vignettes of various photo shoots, video shoots and recording sessions. My favorites were the footage of the Tragic Kingdom album shoot, the making of ""Trapped in a Box"", filming ""Excuse Me Mr"". and recording ""Oi to the World"". At the end of the credits section, look for a hidden clip of the band playing ""World Go 'Round"". An excellent dvd for any No Doubt fan!"
5,100% No Doubt!!!!,"There are absolutey NO negatives about this DVD. Just keep in mind, that the videos are all No Doubt and not Gwen Stefani solo. This is one of the best video collections I've purchased, and as for 5 stars, the DVD ranks closer to 10."
3,Can you say DISAPPOINTED?,"After working out w/the original Tough Tape this past year with excellent results I was looking forward to this video. I was horribly disappointed in Tough Tape 2. It is a choppy video w/segments from various Firm tapes pieced together.There is virtually no explanation of how heavy each weight should be for each segment. Just something like ""ok, pick up your barbell and lift one-two..."". There is very limited lower body work. It really didn't raise my heart rate at all. I barely broke a sweat. I am sticking w/the first Tough Tape and adding heavier weights for a real challenge. This tape is probably good for a beginner but not someone advanced who works out regularly. Try Tough Tape if you haven't already and skip this one."
2,No lo recomiendo,El libro se ve bien pero definitivamente NO me gustaron los Cd. En general pense que iba a ser mejor.
1,J.S.S. ONE NIGHT IN MADRID,"I received this dvd today & watched it. I don't think i was expecting too much; but it turns out i was. I was totally disapointed,wouldn't even call the concert hard rock.Honestly it was wimpy I have been looking for something from J.S.S. on dvd for a while & it turns out i hopefully picked the wrong one. My mistake;if your looking for something heavy it's not this.If you want some soul it is!"
4,Solid,The movie was a solid thriller. It was nice that it was not very predictable and I wasn't sure how it was going to end. The lighting in the theatre sucked so it was hard to see at times. But all in all it was a good movie.
3,TCM Greatest Musicals,"Seven Brides and Show Boat are my favorite musicals, so I figured I could be them together as well as some bonus movies! It's great to have them all together so they take up less space. :)"
5,American Folk-Blues Festival: The British Tours 1963-1966 (DVD),"Overall i absolutely loved this DVD, it's a classic watch.You can't go passed the great Howling Wolf, and it was a joy to be ableto watch Hulbert Sumlin play.Honourable mention goes to Sister Rosetta Tharpe and her Gibson SG, she is an inspiration!"
2,Too much nautical slang,"I became very tired of having to look up the meaning of various nautical terms, many of them pure slang - sometimes several per page. I quickly lost focus. Might be OK for seafaring folks, not for landlubbers."
2,the picture is deceiving,"I was really excited to see that the whole phone was covered by the skin in the picture, but when the skin actually came in it didn't come with all the parts in the picture. Your phone will not look like the one in the picture. It was a waste of money. I paid so much for this skin because I thought the whole phone would be pink just like the picture. I am really disappointed."
1,To good to be true,"When something seems to good to be true(the very low price), it usually is. The first hint was the lack of serial numbers on both adapters(I bought two). The second was when the installation software, WN511B_setup_v7.1_230-1037-13.exe, downloaded from Netgear per the instructions supplied with the adapters did not recognize the adapters at all and did not install either of them. The GENUINE Netgear WG511v2 adapter that I had hoped to replace with these did install properly and functions fine so there is nothing amiss with the notebook.Let the buyer beware."
4,For Dell Latitude C810 running XP,"Had it for about a month. Installation was easy. Config is iffy. I toggled between using the supplied software and XP (built in interface) because with certain wireless access points it worked/performed well with one or the other. For the price, it was a great deal. Running on wireless N network getting a 130mb connection."
2,Just a bit too much whining...,"Having always been a fan of ""Franny Fine"", I felt drawn to her literal work. What a let down. Having known individuals that went through the same surgery as she for the same reasons, reading this book has given me much more respect for those ""non- celebs"" who, I see now, were much stronger, without the luxuries Fran had. Not to dismis the ordeal she went through, the book just was not what I had hoped for. Even her literal sense did her no good to raise her appreciation in my eyes. It goes from slang to intelligence in one paragraph. I would however like to mention, as an animal lover, her chapter deicated to her dog, Chester. Although she is no poet either, it was very touching."
4,Great everyday china,"We chose the Mikasa French Countryside as our china pattern for our wedding in 1996. We have used it as our everyday dishes...everyday! It has worn and broken over the years so we recently needed to get new dishes. I have looked and looked for something new and found nothing that I liked more than the Mikasa so finally just purchased the 45 piece set. This set is timeless. Even though pieces have broken in the past you do have to consider that we use these for breakfast, lunch and dinner, have five children and have moved from Arizona to Alaska. Pretty good in my book!"
2,Disappointed,"I decided to order these dishes since I had previously seen them and they were beautiful but when I got my set, the first box I opened, containing the serving plate, disappointed me. The plate had a small hole behind it. It looked like it was improperly finished. I opened another box. The box containing the cups and saucers. The first saucer on top had the same problem. Unfinished spots all over the bottom. There was no point looking further. I will be sending them back. I am hesitate to get a replacement order since it can happen again. Will buy at the store where I can inspect them myself before purchasing. They looked cheap! Still love shopping at amazon."
3,Amazon''s Description sucks!!!,Does anyone knows where this item was made? Amazon description doesn't tell you where the items are made in most of the time.
3,"Uh, this is NOT for guinea pigs..","The product name says its for guinea pigs, but this thing is WAYYY too tiny for any guinea pig to even fit it's snout into. The actual box lists the animals it's best used for and said nothing about guinea pigs :/ I mean, they'll still eat it but it's useless for a hide out or anything else since they can't fit in. Misleading title is Misleading."
3,Catholics Vindicated,"Bernard Nathanson is the Stephen King of the prolife movement -- anything he writes becomes an instant hit amongst his fans. But this one is not particularly deserving of adulation. Although it does expose how shamelessly NARAL (then the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws) played ""the Catholic Card,"" The Abortion Papers is a disappointment for those expecting a shocking expose. This book does nothing to eclipse Aborting America, and if you have to buy only one Nathanson book, this isn't the one."
5,Do you want to see some incredible wild tattoos?,"This is the best tattoo book I have purchased so far (and I have bought quite a few). The pictures are full color, full page and beautiful. From the basic to the outrageous and everything in between, if you are into piercings or tattoos this is a book for you. I took this book to my tattoo salon and it was a fight to get it back from the other clients, and my tattoo artist. This book caused me to do some stuff my moom isnt going to like, but heck, I am a grown-up and I can always wear a turtle neck! I totally, completely recommend this book."
2,Hmmmm,"IMO: This book isn't all that great..Alot of pictures indeed, but they kind of left out many styles..I didn't see alot of New school tattoos..Also, i looked thru it once and after that the book fell apart!It isn't put together well, so now i have to glue it back together.."
2,Too Much Orange,"I was expecting more of a lavender scent since the item has lavender and valerian on the front of the label as the main scents. But the orange oil masks them all, and I don't, personally, find orange oil aroma relaxing or even pleasant. I think the label on the front should be clearer about the main scent, or else remove the orange oil from the blend entirely."
2,Lavender...or Lemon Pledge?,"I purchased this item hoping to make my pillows and blankets smell more like lavender to lull me to sleep; however, when I sprayed my bedding, all that I smelled was Lemon ""Pledge"" (like the cleaner). This product does NOT smell anything like it claims to and is definitely NOT worth the money! You're better-off investing in a high-quality softener -- you get much more out of it!"
3,Works... when it works,"I got this for my friend who was having trouble falling asleep as an alternative to smoking. He used it (and apparently smoked anyway.) He ended up sleeping an absurd amount of time and we suspect it might be the ""doubling up"" of his normal sleep aids (he said smoking helped him fall asleep. I was trying to help him quit.) He carried it around with him, esp to places where he wouldn't be able to smoke. Last I asked him about it, he said it stopped spritzing and started more like squirting. I'd give it fine reviews for effectivity but low reviews on design."
1,passed on it..,"This has a lovely, light, smell but I just can not tolerate it. It made me wheeze and sneeze; not for me Mike!!"
3,"Great smell, very relaxing. Container leaks.","This has a very pleasant smell. It seems like it has hints of citrus in it as well. It's definitely a light, clean and soothing scent. Unfortunately my pump-spray leaks, pretty much constantly and has to be stored on a paper towel at all times. I do like the scent a great deal and would recommend it based on that. In particular, I've always been very iffy on the smell of Valerian and was worried that this spray would smell too much like it. It doesn't, in fact, I personally can't detect the Valerian (which is a good thing, from my perspective). Hopefully my problems with the pump spray dispenser are just a fluke, or perhaps it was somehow damaged. The scent is great, but be aware that the packaging may not be."
4,"A Must Have, Great Reference Book","I think I'm going to make Christmas Gifts of this book. It is full of great content and agrees with other authors on the same treatments; plus offers insight on herbs, supplements and the bodies systems as well as diseases. There is also a section on food additives and other related topics.It should be in every home. I've been referencing it about 6 years now. It contains a wealth of helpful and shocking information. I gave it 4 stars because it like all the others I have lack information on how much and when to take the remedies, or even suggestions on how to figure that out. Nor do I recall seeing anything about cross tolerance, which is an important factor even with natural products.Vivian GaleAuthor of Fart in the Wind~Get Rid of Emotional Flatulence available here on Amazon."
4,Shifters for 21 Speed bike,These Shimano SL-TY22 Shift levers are new and will work great! They came in a reasonable amount of time and the cost was lower than expected. These are hard to find outside of the high end bike shops.
4,They're not kidding,"about it being plus sized. Maybe it's just my lack of knowledge but these seemed quite a bit larger than other nylons that I had bought for the same partner.As the size was not agreeable, she never really wore them and I can not comment on how they wore."
2,not what you'll want to see,"yea so a couple guys got together to shoot a doc - that's ok enough if you understand what it takes to make a film (the editing, the lighting / time of day / shot angles) but the guys totally miss the mark of trying to make it fun for anybody else watching. I'm sure it was fun to make, but really, in total it was lame. The Bathurst scenes are pretty crazy because people are throwing Molotov cocktails back and forth at each other. They do interview a guy that has a real Interceptor, but they never pop the hood to show the supercharger. Indeed it works since they can barely speak over the whine, but still, besides those two parts, there's no other stars - hence my rating"
3,3 of 5,"Nikki, played by a sexy Kerry Washington, is hot and ready. If I were her friend Richard, played by a semi-funny Chris Rock, I wouldn't have any moral problem cheating on my wife with her. His co-worker George seems to get it. He's been cheating on his wife for years, with different women, and all he needs is Viagra to keep it up. But he's slick and discreet. Richard is a buffoon. So when he does decide to cross the line, if only by a little, everyone seems to know. The point this romantic comedy, sloppily written and directed by Chris Rock himself, misses is that having sex with another woman has nothing to do with whether or not you love your wife.marcellee.com"
5,Funny but true!,"This is one of those movies that makes you laugh and keeps you on the edge, will he or wont he? You have to see it to find out for sure!"
2,Just 'okay' film; great soundtrack.,"Unfortunately, Mr Rock trots out the unnecessary racial humor, of the slightly stinging variety. I felt as if I'd paid 7.50 to be insulted for an hour and a half. At some point in the film, the race humor died down for the most part and it began to be somewhat humorous fun again.Too bad no soundtrack is available for this film; there are some catchy gems. By the way, does anyone know the names of some of the song titles or their artists?"
1,only one word to describe this movie: HORRIBLE!,"i never thought this guy could be qualified as a comedian, not even close. he never made me laugh. i never understood why hbo would have signed him season after season. this movie, my god, simply drove me nuts. i hopped from the other showing room into this one to try it out, but my lord, how could you call this a 'movie'? how could you accept this guy as an actor? he's not even qualified for a 'b' or 'c' listed movie. acting, screenplay...what a mess."
3,I think i am being generous.,"This movie gets an ""A"" for effort. Chris Rock attempted to do a mature movie. But the execution feel short. The misplaced and over used F-bomb kind of destroyed it for me. People aren't that crude in the real world (or I am not living in it).AND THE SONG AT THE END MADE SICK TO MY STOMACH!!!"
2,Like a wet noodle,I got this for my 2 1/2 year old son who loves to make music. This looks good in the pictures but the pieces don't stay together easily and fall away so that when you hold it up to play it flops downward then completely falls apart. You have to try to hold it together as it flops around like a wet noodle. Very frustrating for mom and toddler! My son wanted to make it hold together so badly and couldn't understand why it kept falling apart that he eventually started crying from frustration. I had to put it away. The Grover-Trophy Slide Whistle at $2 is a thousand times more entertaining for him and me. Also the Early Learning Centre Trumpet with Color Coded Keys $17 was a big hit with my son. My advice is to pass on the Quercetti.
4,An added bonus,I bought this to complement the Tubation toy. Adds an extra dimension to the toy. Very good value for money.
5,My life just got musically inclined !!,"I followed the advice of the previous reviewer and bought this player with the car kit. It is just fabulous!! I hooked it up in the car in about 5 minutes and wham, bang, thank you maam !!! The sound is great. It is so easy to use and I just love the little remote which can fast forward to a song or backup to a song or turn the unit off. The sound is also great by itself with batteries and headphones. I agree with the previous reviewer that the headphones are not anything special. I have a pair of Koss ""street-style behind the neck"" headphones which work much better because they are so comfortable. I can't imagine a better deal. Someone at Sony knows what they are doing....how refreshing......"
3,Who cares about Trull?,"I found the first four books enjoyable. That said... this book is ok but Trull Sengar is just not someone that i can connect with like i can Kalam, Whiskyjack, Quick Ben, Apsalar, Crockus, Paran, or Fiddler.I love reading Erikson's work (enough to say that i honestly cannot read anything else in this genre for the feeling that something is missing). I am used to his slow starts (it takes me longer to read the first 200- 300 pages than it does the rest of the novel) but this was horrificly slow and i was bored to tears till page 513 by which i was so frustrated that i could find no interest in the story and had to stop reading.I cant wait until book 6 so that maybe i can continue reading this marvelous series."
1,It's only a model!,This isn't as sturdy as some starships since it is a model but this was the only X-wing my 7 year old could find. Some instructions weren't very clear and it is easy to put the wings together wrong.
2,For Those Who Must Have Everything Wagner Related,"An English-language version of an Italian-made TV documentary. It consists solely of footage of Venetian scenery and a voice-over by Orson Welles reading Venice-related entries from Wagner's diaries. The cinematography is dark and murky, and the pace of the film is funereal. One must be in a certain sort of mood to sit through it."
3,Not what I expected,"Being a fan of IM for many years, I was disappointed in their latest effort, BEFRIENDED. The writing is spare - repetitive and morose. The music is draggy and simple. I expected the spiritual uplift that I adored with ""You chase the light"" and ""Wonder of Birds"". ""Every Hour Here"", ""Umbrella"" and ""Joan"" were little vignettes that moved me to tears. I find none of these feelings when I listen to BEFRIENDED. The CD is very, very short, and I expected more after waiting four years for something new."
3,Maybe my baby used these too late,"Bought these and my baby do not enjoy it, the product is innovative but i think maybe i let my baby tried too late, she was about 10mths old when i let her use these. And she does not like it. NOt the product's fault but maybe its more suitable for babies below her age."
3,The Extended Romanov Family in Photographs,"I enjoyed this book, as I did Ms. Zeepvat's book on Queen Victoria's family, however I was expecting more photos of Nicholas II and his family. I was also disappointed that most of the photos that were included have been seen multiple times in other sources. Since the extended Romanov family is not as well known as the Windsors I also wish the photographs would have been organized by generation rather than by category (military service, deaths, etc.). The photo quality throughout the book is good. My summary; the book is worth getting but don't expect alot on Nicholas, Alexandra and their children."
2,Not very realistic.,"I was looking for good historical fiction to appeal to boys, and this sounded like a possibility. Unfortunately, compared to books like Night Journies, The Bell Keeper, and Jericho's Journey, this was pretty weak. The story line basics are okay, but the author throws in so many unrealistic dilemmas that I was laughing by the end to see what disaster would happen next. Also, the children are modern rather than typical of the 18th century."
4,Spot Removers,"These work better than average, and if they got out even more stains, I would have given them a 5 star rating. My husband has a hole in his lip, so coffee, sodas, tomato sauce, etc. live on his shirts!! This spot remover most of the time, does the trick."
3,some info is outdated,"I purchased this book to work with a student I am tutoring in English. The chapters cover a nice variety of topics related to business English, and the grammar explanations are reasonably clear. The conversations on the CD are the standard sort of conversations found in an ESL book--read by actors who pronounce everything much more clearly than a normal person. The book's greatest weakness is that some of the cultural information in it is badly outdated. For example, the chapter on registering for school states that most US schools use social security numbers as student ID numbers. That has not been true for many years, and is in fact illegal. That same chapter goes to great pains to explain the difference between a rotary phone and a touchtone phone. I have not seen a rotary phone in this country in years (and my student had never seen one). This book is sorely overdue for a new edition."
1,worthless,"I bought one of these today and cannot get it to do anything useful. I've honed it and adjusted many different ways. On my test block of oak, there was only one thing I could do without chatter marks--a tiny bevel on a sharp corner with the blade just about in the body. As soon as I took a little wood off, it would not cut what remained without readjusting, which then chattered. The problem is that once the blade engages the wood, there is nothing to stop it from diving in deeper, since the sole is round. Angling the spokeshave helps a little, and with the right pressure, speed, and grip, I reduced the chattering. However, with no way to eliminate the chattering, this tool is useless to me. I basically agree with the other reviews I've seen. I'll be returning this tomorrow."
3,Works Sporadically,"This item did the job, allowing me to connect my old TV with an RF connector to my gamecube. Often, the device would not establish a connection immediately, but only after some fiddling, hitting and jostling. This is pretty bad for a piece of solid state circuity.After a couple of years it just died. I'll probably try another brand this time."
5,My most valuable resource since the birth of my first child.,This book has always provided useful information 'at your fingertips' whenever needed. From the most minor baby afflictions to diseases that run rampant through daycares and schools.Notifications and postings of sicknesses making their way through these social centers become more manageable when I can reference them and be on the lookout for symptoms. It has been a real life saver!I buy this book for all the new mothers that I know.
1,Disappointed,"Little House in BrookfieldI purchased this item, and chose the seller as they were helping an animal rescue. I never recieved the book, disappointed as it was a Christmas gift for my daughter. I wrote to the seller and they did respond immediately with an apology and instant refund. The seller also told me they did ship it to me and if I ever do recieve it to keep the book and the refund. I never recieved as of today."
2,Missed Opportunity,"I pulled this book off my shelf hoping to use it for a Blues History class I'm teaching this semester. Then I remembered why it's been sitting on the shelf unused for years: this would-be wonderful anthology has on index of musicians or song titles. Yes, in this collection of hundreds of blues lyrics, there is absolutely no way to locate the lyrics of a particular musician, or the lyrics to a particular song. Instead, the lyrics of King Solomon hill are located in the ""New Orleans to Jackson"" chapter, and Robert Pete Williams ""I Got So Old"" is located in the chapter titled ""Somewhere to End."" How clever and useful. There IS a clear index of illustrations. Gee, thanks."
1,melted in dishwasher - too thin,"very thin and light plastic which melted in the dishwasher and is now bent out of shape. these glasses are ""disposable"" quality despite their ""permanent"" pricing. do not buy."
3,A bit big...,"These are the size of a regular glass for drinking coffee / water... But for price, I guess it's a good deal."
2,Plastic stemless glasses,"I recently bought these 'glasses' as I was directing a play outdoors and needed glassware that would 'bounce' if dropped. For the purpose I bought them they were great, they looked good and did indeed bounce. However if you are thinking of buying them for everyday (or even picnic use) I would say don't. The plastic at the rim is rough and unpleasant to drink from and they are a lot thinner and cheaper than I had hoped."
2,A Basic Self-Contradiction,"Israel and Tarver write that they respect the self-determination of transgendered people, yet they propose guidelines that leave decisions about transgendered people's bodies, ultimately, in the hands of mental health professionals. The authors do not address this basic self-contradiction. To their credit, the authors also include essays by other writers, some of whom contest this autonomy-denying aspect of their proposed guidelines."
4,Best Lucy Stone so far!,"I've read all the Lucy Stone mysteries up to this point and this Christmastime addition is my favorite so far. Lucy tries not to get involved in what is going on, and I was unable to figure out ""whodunnit."" Lucy's homelife seems to get more and more crazy as her kids get older, adding an interesting aspect to the series. A fun, short read for mystery fans."
4,Esa ortografía,"La historia de Corduroy es muy bella y educativa, pero esta edición en español seguramente fue traducida por gente que no domina este idioma ya que tiene muchos errores ortográficos. Lo cual, por cierto, no desvirtúa la historia, por lo cual no me queda más que recomandarles que la lean."
3,"This is an ""ok"" holster","I use it for my S&W CS9 on days I need a fast clip-on OWB holster under a medium jacket. The paddle is a little too small to keep the whole thing from total wobble. But it is solid - not too bad. I like holsters that are tight against my body and this is not a hugger but does the job for the price. I will use it, but it won't be my favorite form of carry. The good part is that it fits my CS9 like a glove."
3,"Cheap, and it tries to deliver but doesn't quite do it.","You can tell what they were trying to do in Blood and Sex Nightmare. It's a cheap looking film that tries hard but doesn't quite succeed. I believe the film was made while the director was in film school or had just graduated. Kudos to him for making the thing, but in the genre of modern extreme horror, it didn't quite do it for me. More like a renter than a buyer in my opinion.... sadly, it was not available on Netflix."
4,Good video,This video was good enough. The story and all were fantastic. Great information. I wish it went a little more into detail about the construction of the house and the conversion of the dairy farm into what is now the winery but it was pretty informative regardless. The only major drawback that keeps it from being a 5 is that I couldn't get it to play on my DVD player. It kept locking up at the start. I actually had to play it on my PS2 and it worked fine.
3,Almost...,"This product is acceptable, but could easily have been great. It's an update on the Trimline design for the Caller ID era. We don't use Caller ID, so I can't address those features, just the basic operation and styling of this last-of-the-corded-phones.Styling?Almost...The handset is fine, but the base is clearly taller and clunkier than it needs to be.Operation?Almost...While voice quality is generally good, the background noise level is fair at best. And this phone doesn't like it when another phone is off-hook (to allow two people to share a conversation). When you join a conversation from one of our two cordless phones, this one begins to click rhythmically and you can no longer hear the conversation."
1,very disappointed,"We were looking for a new phone to replace our old one that no longer worked after 20+ years. The phone claims to have caller id, but whenever a call comes in there is no information available to view before picking up the phone. Also, this phone claims to be ""wall mountable"". I mounted it to the wall (where the old one was), put the receiver on and the receiver wouldn't stay. This is a very disappointing product from at&t. They don't make them like they used to. We'll be lucky to get a year out of this phone."
3,at&t caller id phone,"this is one of the few trim-line phones out there. it has an inter-changeable cord so you can put a longer cord if you need to. the only bad thing about the phone is that it sticks out of the wall so far. GE makes the same phone and it is so much nicer in appearance from the side, but has a permanent cord so you cant change it to another length. in this day and age where everything is getting smaller, it would be nice if at&t would make a more sleek model, like the discontinued, trim-line southwestern bell freedom phone."
1,not happy,I believe this is an old phone...when you answer the phone somtimes you will inadvertly hit the buttons on receiver. Not happy with this purchase.
1,not worth it,"I was looking for a simple wall phone. The backlight does not work, there for I have no caller id or last call incoming. I read the bad reviews and thought I may overlook them for the price, it is way too annoying. I find myself looking for another phone while in the room with this one. The faults expressed in the reviews are real and very annoying."
3,Good phone but annoying blinking light,"As someone who lives in an old home with few electrical outlets and limited space, I love a good old Trimline landline phone. This phone works well for that purpose, and has some good modern features beyond that of the regular Trimline. However, it has the annoying feature of a blinking light to show that calls have come in, even if the phone was picked up. We find it rather annoying to have the phone blinking in our otherwise dark hallway all night just because we received (and answered) a call before bedtime and didn't have time to empty the call log. It would make more sense if it blinked only to warn you that calls came in and were not picked up."
1,Garbage,"At first glance and first use, this phone seems to be just the ticket. Basic and cheap. Problem is though its more the cheap than the basic. The AT&T product designers should keep in mind who would want to use this phone, especially from their existing customer base. They are the people who loved the Trimline Phones for the same reason. Many of these people are now elderly. The bottom line is--is that its a touch tone phone, and you can BARELY hear the tones that come out of the phone when you press the buttons. They are almost non-existent. Oh yes, they are there, and theres nothing wrong with the speakers, as the dial tones and voices are of the correct volume. Just the touch tones. But, it is a huge issue, as people do like the audible confirmations that what they dialed is ""heard"" by the phone."
4,A delightful little book...,"I'm sorry to see that this delightful, albeit different, book is out of stock. I would never expect it to be a best seller. Nonetheless, the imaginative story and interesting art work are worth a look."
2,The projects are not easy to follow.,"I am really surprised that this book has so many positive reviews because I am usually very satisfied with any product I get based to user reviews. The overall concept of the book is really great, but it doesn't give very good direction. The idea is to get your feet wet and learn all the basic sewing concepts by doing three projects, but the projects are not described very well at all. I found myself reading the instructions multiple times and as other reviewers have stated, the pictures were pretty useless. Also, the patterns that I received were not complete; they were not the same as in the pictures and that made it very difficult to determine if I was doing things correctly. Basically, for a beginner, the directions for completing the projects needed to be much more comprehensive and descriptive."
4,animated spaceballs,"great! Same writing, same characters, and filled with the great wit and charm. definitely a Mel Brooks project. loved it except an episode is missing"
5,I LOVE these dolls!,"I absolutely fell in love seeing these dolls online. Just wait till you get it! I felt like I was holding my own baby for the first time. They smell like a baby with a clean diaper on and baby powder. I own the sarah, porter and kennedy dolls. I want more but am waiting for another sale.The only problem is the hair and their heads. Their hair is a wig that is barely attached so dont let your little kids play with these dolls or they will most definetly rip off their wigs. Their heads are also going to be easily ripped off with kids. The head isnt sewed on to the body it is kind of loose and rotates around a bit. If I let my kids hold them I am right there watching them like a hawk. My kids kissed the dolls and tucked them into bed and said night night!I actually went on Kohls and got this doll for 30% off using their code and got it for $35 with tax."
4,New sound to hit songs,"The only CD I have found that gives the ""mature"" today sound that you hear at their concerts. Although it is not the greatest recording, it is the most up to date one out there. I wish that they would make a studio recording of the tour concerts they are now performing. Their voices are much more polished than the were as teenagers and it brings a whole new sound to their music."
1,I wish they had no stars...,"I will the spray will deter you more than your dog! It makes you choke when you spray it, my dog never seemed to be that concerned while I was spraying it. He also continue to chew the items I sprayed it on...along with the Bitter End bottle itself!"
2,"Wrong language! Case said English, but actual audio was German","The DVD was not only bad, the narrator spoke in German. Then after the first minute of excellent dance instructions in German the DVD went blank and never came back on!"
1,doesn't work,"I received the DVD on time, put it in the dvd player, titles come up, but then nothing......a blank screen. The DVD didn't work."
4,"An obscure, but grand little corner of the world.","Granted, the traditional music of the Northeast region of Brazil is an obscure outpost in the realm of World Music. But the Nordeste, as it is called, is rich in history and culture and occupies an important place in the Brazilian national character. It has a rich musical heritage, influenced by the Portuguese and the Dutch that, like all Brazilian music, has deep African roots. And it will make you dance, for sure!The music on this CD is the centerpiece of an excellent movie that explores a corner of this tradition, the Repentistas-- rap artists for the previous millennia. Obscure? Sure, but its considerable charms are absolutely unique and completely Nordestino.P.S. The fascinating film traces the plight of Nordestinos who migrate to the megalopolis of So Paulo and the central place that music plays in their lives."
3,Not what I thought,"These are big horse pills and not actual tablets. They smell like bacon and my dog still dribbles. I thought this was my old brand but I was wrong. Not bad, but not what I expected."
4,helpful,This product has helped some. My dog still has to go a lot but has stopped going in the house. He used to go out and then would come back in and still have an accident. That has stopped!
1,My Dog HATES this pill.,"I spent $25 on these. They worked, I think. My dog was peeing in her sleep on a nightly basis. 3 days after I started administering these pills, they worked. For a few days, and now she is peeing again on about the 7th day. The biggest problem aside from I'm not sure if they are a good solution, is trying to get these pills into my dog. She finds them in everything. I have researched and tried every method out there (hiding it in cheese, meat, a hotdog, making it powder and putting it in her food, or mixing it into yogurt, or goat milk. She has become suspect of everything I give her to eat, and I think its starting to create a bad habit of not eating when I feed her. I have had to resort to jamming it down her throat, and trust me, doing this twice a day for the rest of her life, really sucks. It's difficult, and unpleasant for both of us. I wake up, and I dread having to give her, her first pill of the day. I'm going to try Leaks No More.~Allen"
5,Gunsmoke Movie Collection,"Excelent package. I'm a big fan of James Arness. Looking for 2 more movies. Gunsmoke IV and Gunsmoke V. Amazon .com was fast in getting these to me,3 days. If you like Gunsmoke/James Arness, I highly recommend this package."
5,The Glory of the Manger,"The author mades a most reable case for the incarnation, ministry,passion, and resurrection of Christ. I enjoyed it was enriched by it and lend it to others who were equally blessed."
2,Started off alright.,"A light read. I read this book in two days, not really because I couldn't put it down but because there weren't that many pages and it has larger print than usual. This book deals with domestic violence but in my opinion it does not explore that theme in enough depth. It does have some funny moments, but the ending is something to be left undesired. However, if you want something quick to read that doesn't take much concentration you may opt for this romantic thriller."
4,A very good read,This book was good from the beginning to the end. I was hooked on the first page. The author did a very good job with the characters. This book also taught me the importance of forgiving and healing and how they both work together.
1,Blu Ray Review,"The movie is excellent and therefore this review is of the Blu Ray disc only. The ""protective film"" used on the disc is defective. If you attempt to clean dust from the disc (and all disc arrive with a speck or two of dust),with a soft cloth specially made to do this, the ""protective film"" will scratch. Out of the two hundred blu rays I've collected only this one and ""The Ant Bully"" are like this. I asked for replacements of both and the replacements did the same thing. The blu ray laser is more narrow then the DVD laser and therefore the blu ray does not track errors as well. Scratches become an issue with the blu ray discs."
3,"Well, this isn't the old Dr. Strange","I suppose this is the Ultimate Universe version. He's got a hip haircut and there is a lot of Kung-Foolery going on here with a little magic to boot. I would have much rather seen the classic Dr. Strange get the animated treatment especially since magic is all the rage now a days (can anyone say Harry Potter?) Instead they went all Kung-Fu with this one.It wasn't for me but so far I've been disappointed with all the Marvel Animated movies. I thought the Ultimate Avengers 1 was fine, 2 was fair, Iron Man was awful, and this is probably in last place of all of them.That being said the animation is fantastic, I certainly can't fault this on a production level.All the Dr. Strange supporting cast is here including Mordo, Wong, and company. It's just not classic Dr. Strange... and that metro-hair cut needs to go."
3,"Decent adaptation, good for entertaining.","I actually was not familiar with Dr. Strange. But, its a unique story, learning to become altruistic, humanistic, and have humility is a hard thing to do. I do tend to over-analyze things, and for a man with messed up hands, he certainly climbed those mountains well. And for being a smart doctor, he was really a dumb human being. But, the lesson learned is still valuable despite the overall mediocre plot and story. I do actually want to see a sequal to see how the plot will continue. Worth watching if you like the Avenger cartoon movies."
1,The Truth.,"If you want to see how a legendary comic book company like Marvel sells out to the manga/anime industry then this Doctor Strange dvd is a perfect example.Instead of breaking ground with a new kind of animation, one worthy of its classic characters, Marvel and Lion's Gate jump on the manga wagon.It is so heartbreaking to see these iconic characters rendered so poorly.Marvel and Lion's Gate are clearly more interested in money than quality.Spit something out cheap and fast and make as much as we can off the Anime/Manga trend.This movie, like the previous Iron Man release, screams CHEAP!"
4,Re-enactor's delight,"This book contains 9 projects adapted from period quilts. These are linked rather whimsically to 9 women of the period. There is no evidence that the women profiled actually made quilts like these or, in fact, ever made any quilts at all. Ms. Brackman has used a little creative journalism, what the TV people like to call the docu-drama approach, to connect nine women who represent particular types and quilts that women like them were making. If your love is for historical trivia, about women or the Civil War period, you will likely find this book fascinating. Each chapter ends with a series of activities which could be used by re-enactors or by history teachers. There are numerous etchings and photographs of the period."
5,Sonic Excellence,"Simply put, this sounds GREAT.Worth the price if you're looking for the material and SOUND is the difference.Downside is that the cd is approximately 38 minutes worth of music.I still give it 5 stars because of the sound. Expensive for a reason.This same item is listed twice so you may check the price on the other. Good stuff - as is all of the material in this series."
2,"Nice try, NO CIGAR (maybe a cigarette..""mit ah kaveh"").","For those readers without a full working Yiddish or understanding of (C)Hasidim, this book is certainly an interesting read. However, most accounts are without a doubt fiction. Mr. Eisenberg's Yiddish is surprisingly good for someone of his backround, but not as good as a native speaker. Some of his quotes attributed to 1st. language Yiddish speakers would never say what he says they did. Everything from proper meaning and use of Yiddish words, to practice and philosophy of the orthodox Jew. More than some of his accounts are not only partually or fully fiction, but is offensive to myself and I'm sure to any other fellow Hasidic reader. My advise to Mr. Eisenberg is JUST BE HONEST! We Hasdim are stranger and more interesting than fiction, go with that."
2,Arrived Slightly Damaged,"Was leaking a little bit when it arrived. I probably should have returned it... I know Amazon would have done me right. But I needed to print some pages, so I just went ahead and used it. Small streak on my pages some times. I think there are just a few products that can't handle extreme temperatures and the abuse by the USPS... this is one of them."
2,"Economical, but NOT Water Resistant!","This ink is fine for very basic printing needs; it's economical. Just don't get it wet, or try to use an overliner on it (sorry students and researchers)!!! My 8-year old Canon BJ-200e (which uses the BC-02 Black cartridge) is far superior in terms of water resistance! You would think that after 8 years, Canon would improve their product, not make it worse! I wish all printer makers would go with Pigment Black Ink that is very water resistant."
2,Ink Cartridges - but not what I ordered,"I ordered what I saw in the photo Canon ink cartridges from Gener Ink, but I was sent a ""no name"" brand. Literally, there was no name on it. I think this is false advertising. It took several emails and me having to send back the no name cartridges without getting reimbursed for the postage, but my acct Amazon says has been credited. I can't say I learned a lesson, because I thought I was getting what was pictured. Just order from Canon if you want Canon - it is a good brand."
3,It's average..,I also had an older Canon printer which used the BC-02 cartridges and upgraded to a newer Canon S300 printer last year which uses the BCI-24 cartridge and noticed the water resistant difference. The BC-02 ink seemed to be a higher quality as I don't recall my children smudging school printouts near as much as they do with the BCI-24. This is unfortunate but it's a cheap printer..bound to have lower quality ink I suppose.
5,Great bargain!,"I bought it off Amazon Market with a great discount. The ink work well, just ask described. Even with the online price, this is still more worth it than in-store prices."
1,Why no super saver shipping?,Why does this item not qualify for free shipping? The color cartridges do. I'm not going to spend $6 on the cartridge and $7 on shipping!
1,Not in English,This is a book in German. If you only speak English and are looking for a helpfull book full of culinary terms is several languages this is NOT it.I sent mine back ! I could not read any of the text except for the ocasional English words.
2,I guess I didn't get it,This book was just plan old boring to me. Maybe I just didn't get what Shaara was trying to say. Maybe this kind of touchie feely story doesn't appeal to me. It took me 4 days to push my way thru it.I hope his civil War Novels are better. I bought all three after a friend recommended them.
3,shipping problems,"The set is very nice, exactly as described. I ordered 2 sets, both arrived with at least 1 broken glass. There really isn't much effort made in the packaging to prevent breakage. I had to send them both back."
2,Didn't work for me,"Unfortunately, the product didn't work for me. The s-video connection gave an image with a very grainy look to it. Surprisingly, the composite video connection gave a much better image."
1,Junk,"Bought 2 as I did not think anyone could muck up a product as simple as this. WAS I WRONG. installed, as noted in other reviews the pin hole is too small. After installed, opened the door and it would not stay open. Then tried to remove the strap, pull to the outside and open the door all the way, the strap had opened so far on first use it would not come out, used needle nose pliers to crimp it far enough to get it out. Took out a second time, cleaned, reshaped and used some JB weld to see if I could stiffen it. worked once, all i have tried so far. Will see if it works again. Looked at the second one, I see a way to weld an extra strap of metal to add tension to the design but should I have to??? Too thin and basically junk. How hard can it be to copy a functional part??"
1,Don't buy this product,"I had to drill out the hole for the pin and bushing to install the straps. All four straps failed the first time I opened the doors. The manufacturer replaced the defective straps, and three of the new straps failed as well. This is a poorly made product.The straps I previously purchased from my local GMC dealer worked correctly and lasted six years before needing replacement."
1,Very poor door strap,"Very poor quality. I had to drill the hole for the pin and sleeve to slide trough. It was out of round. The strap is much lighter made than the oem it just spread apart and won't ""spring"" back to catch the door after the first time opening the door."
5,Meta Xenia,I first watched this movie in the States with my grandkids 6 years ago and I loved it . Now I purchased it for my grandkids in Europe. It is an amazing movie.
3,Esta es la versión clásica,"Es la version original, un poco antigua, el sonido no es muy bueno. Pero mis hijas disfrutaron viéndolas. Las balletistas son buenas. En lo particular prefiero que Clara sea adolecente porque es mas bailada la obra."
3,Fairly good production,"I can recommend it.This is a fairly good production, and a good one to watch if your are not familiar with ballet."
4,My two years daughter loves it.,I bought this DVD for my 2 1/2 years old daughter last Christmas. She enjoyed to watch it and asked me to play it again and again. Then I let her go to a ballet class now. I think this DVD could be a good introduction for the kids who wants to be a ballet dancer.
1,ugh!,I certainly see why this movie was released directly to DVD. Seagal's movies for the most part are dreadful and this one is not any better. I had to be in a coma to purchase it.
2,"Seagal looks withdrawn, not a valid Blu","My customers keep hoping for Seagal to return to his glory days, but unfortunately the last few films have made it to where people will not even rent his stuff now. This one won't necessarily help, but it doesn't hurt his chances too much either.Standard story: He is retired from being a mean guy, something bad happens to someone he cares about, the close up of his eyes becoming angry, then lots of bad guys meet their end. To be clear, this had the most gratuitous close-up of his face I have ever seen - it scared me. What bothered me the most is he seems tired. Not sure how else to word it, I don't think his heart is in these.The Blu quality was below average. Plenty of grain, focus issues and other tech problems. I love DTS, but this wasn't mixed well. The fake sounds of Seagal beatings detracted from trying to watch. No special features to speak of. Can not recommend this as a Blu purchase over the DVD quality."
1,How Many Abducted Daughters/Nieces Does He Have?,"How many seconds in the opening minutes did the camera stay focused on a string of pearls lying on the floor? Answer: A little less than 6 seconds. An indication of boredom to follow!How many times can a person make money off of retreads? Answer: Over 30.How many times have Seagal's movies involved him having a family member killed/abducted by bad ""whatevers""? Answer: Most of those 30.How many weapons in Seagal's movie arsenal? Answer: Lost track.How many times does he intersperse gun play with fight scenes using his stiff as a board ""move your hands around"" and pan the camera? Answer: Almost every movie.How many of his movies have ""kill"" or some variation of ""death"" in the title? Answer: 8.How many times did I fall asleep and not even bother to finish the movie? Answer: 1 and that's sufficient to resolve my mistake."
1,Straight to the Dumpster,"I thought Steven Seagal wasn't making movies any more. I guess I was right. This isn't a movie. It's Ed Wood with a pistol. It's hard to imagine where he still gets financial backing from or who buys this stuff. Ever since above the law and the first under siege movie Steve's been packing on the pounds and cranking out one clunker after another. I love good martial arts and action - think Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Jet Li etc., but Seagal is embarrasing. He could stunt double for Orson Wells."
2,These are not wine glasses,"Maybe I should have guessed this given their price, but sometimes one does get good deals by buying the non-high-end-brand version of things. Not this time: these are not 'stemless wine glasses', they are simple tumblers. The glass is far too thick to call them wine glasses. They also look rather cheap: the bottom is not very solid, being the same thickness as the rest of the glass; all of mine have thin circular lines (and some have small dent marks) from how the glass was blown and handled when still soft. A dollar a piece and the label 'tumbler' would have made them a reasonable deal."
4,Fine for everyday,"This is a bit thicker than my other stemless wine glasses, but fine for a Tuesday night wine. I also like using them for water glasses at dinner."
1,Couldn't finish this one.,"I just couldn't stay with this story. I started another book and came back to it with the same problem. Just a story about a woman who married multiply men and took everything she could. I think the story tried to cover to many marriages and jumped from one to another with no getting to know the charactors story. When I buy a book I at least want to finish it so I get my money's worth, this was a first for me. I don't even care to read the last pages."
1,horrid,"Keep away. Buy at your own risk. It wasn't even as good as the Jean Rabe's past DL novels, which weren't all that great to begin with. The main character ends the book with the scale still attached to his leg even though the entire point of the book (which was the point of the last too). And another novel is due to come out. Bet it ends the same way."
3,EyeToy Party! My House! Be There!,"Man let me tell you how good I am at this game. I suck at DDR but man oh man I can really tear through this one like tissue paper...WORD! If you've played EyeToy Play, Groove is pretty much the beats game in it with the cds and the speakers. Its a lot harder though cause the make you do different motion other than fist fist fist fist (you guys know what I'm talking about) It got REAL SONGS and most of them are REALLY BAD SONGS!!!! I just wish there were more modes to this game, its kinda all the same. But I'm gonna go practice and the try out for the next Wade Robson Project."
3,New but not in a good condition,"When I received this book that was supposed to be in new condition, I noticed that it wasn't in its best condition. I'm not saying it was tattered or had been used before, but I could tell it had been lying around the store I bought it from since 1993, when it was first published and therefore, the corners of the book are starting to be peeled of and it's quite dirty. I understand the chlorine in the paper made it look yellow and I'm not commenting on that, but it's definitely not in its best condition. I think it should be specified that it hadn't been kept in a clean surface, as I wanted to give this book as a gift, and I'm not going to now."
3,Chase,"No problems with the CD, though the case was broken. This was disappointing as it was a gift for someone."
1,Get real,"Oh puleaseee! Give me a break. Save your money. I was a police dispatcher, and this book is not some greatly awaited inside look into police vocabulary.Most of what cops really say cannot be put in print, and they sure as heck wouldn't put it there for liability purposes."
1,A piece of garbage!!!,"I purchased this gun for my 12 year old son. The first one I received fired one shot, and then the battery door broke off. HotImportToys replaced it with a second one. It fired one shot and has not fired again. I imagine they would replace this one as well, however, I'm not going to return it as I've already paid more in shipping than the item is worth. My advice is to spend a bit more money and get one of higher quality."
1,DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The first thing i thought of this when i got it was it looks nothing like the picture.but i still thought it was pretty cool. About after the 50th shot it broke into pieces. And i thought what a rip off!!! So i suggest not buying this gun! p.s i did not drop it or anything.
5,Why still not on CD?!,"Yes, WHY hasn't it been put on CD yet? I, too, look every year hopeful. I have the vinyl, but no way to put on CD. This would be a HUGE seller! Why hasn't anyone done anything about his yet?"
4,THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COLORS,This product gives us the experience in the use of fabrics and colors in quilts.
5,Love this book!,"I love this book. Wow! If you want to learn all about color and how to put them together to make outstanding quilts or for anything that you need to use color on - like home dec, etc. Now I know why I never liked orange and blue together - I was using the wrong blue."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this item because it was advertised next to a Clinique product I have been using with great satisfaction for years. The product is Clinique Moisture-in-Control, which, when I last tried to purchase another, I was told has been discontinued. I liked this product because it is quickly absorbed by my skin, leaving little oily feeling or residue on top of which I had to apply my face powder. The oil-free moisture formula product has none of these virtues. I put it on in the morning and, even an hour later, feel that putting on my powder will deposit moisture on my powder puff when I put on my powder. I don't know if it is possible, but I would be extremely happy if I could recover the money I spent (over $70)."
2,Simpleminded,"With just a limited time to study the Columbine shootings, and with limited access to the parents and friends of the shooters, the Investigating Reports team puts together a shallow analysis of why the shootings occurred. The team, intending to get into the minds of Dylan and Harris, end up making no more than educated guesses about what drove the young men to murder and suicide. The investigators suggest that bad parenting and a bullying school culture were to blame, as well as media dwelling overmuch on mass murders. All of this may well be true. But the paucity of firsthand evidence makes the case extremely weak. In the end, I saw this film as just another way to fill up 44 minutes of air time and to re-air pictures of shot-out windows, grieving friends and emergency vehicles. The IR ""explanation"" of the tragedy is almost guaranteed not to advance insight into thr case, and will have absolutely no effect on the frequency of future incidents."
4,Good reminder,"I am a fan of ""The Secret"" and this movie was just a refresher and a reminder. Not the best as far as content, mainly just people talking, but definitely something to help you remember."
3,Slave Day comes up short,"The premise was interesting and some of the individual stories were intriguing but put altogether the parts didn't come together in a completely satisfying whole.For a young adult novel, I was a little turned off by all the cursing. More than a little.PPS. Sometimes, the characters' dialogues didn't ring true. It didn't help the awkward use of having them speak in a Southern dialect."
5,Carlos Saura's Flamenco Trilogy-Genius in Motion,"If you love the flow of dance, this trilogy will delight you. I originally saw these three films when they came out. Since I speak Spanish and love the culture, I fell in love at first sight. The Spanish word ""duende"" refers to the state a flamenco dancer enters when the spirit of dance takes over. I would suppose we could compare it to being in the zone. These films are true to that spirit. There isn't a single false note. If you want to understand the Spanish culture, these films are the perfect way to learn what the essence of the culture is all about."
2,Not what it seems,"I didn't buy this here. I got it at a cosmetic store. I have hair about the length to your bra strap in back. I had a brush somewhat like this one before but not interchangeable brushes. This one does not work!! I dryed my hair half way then put the bigger brush on. This is where the problem lies!! It only attaches at the top where there is a release button. So, as I was drying my hair you HAVE to put firm pressure on the end to make sure the other part of the brush does not come lose. I am returning mine tomorrow. I think I will exchange it for one that is not interchangeable, because then it will be more secure to the handle."
5,Glad I spend a couple extra dollars on this one,"I've owned one of these brush-type dryers for several years, and it finally bit the dust a couple of weeks ago. I couldn't find ANY of this type of brush dryer in my local stores (including WalMart, Walgreens and Meijer). I knew Amazon would have some, and I wasn't disappointed. I was going to get one of the cheaper models, but decided on this Revlon 1200W Ion one, just because of the good reviews posted. And I'm glad I did. For an extra [...] bucks or so, which got me free shipping, I got a much more superior product that the old one I bought for about $[...]. I am so impressed with this dryer. It's sturdy and drys my hair faster and gives it more body and shine. I hope Revlon doesn't phase this type of dryer out, as I love it. Very satisfied."
2,Love Hate RV1200W,"I really like the capacity to dry and curl and having two sizes of brushes is a bonus. Having the cool setting is very nice. The high setting gets really hot and so does the brush area. I was disappointed the last time I took the brush dryer with me on a trip. The small tip that snaps the brush into place broke off. I have carpeted floor in my bath and bedroom, so if the dryer was dropped it dropped onto a carpeted floor. Anyway, I have had this dryer less than a year. Not sure if this is a recurring problem with other users. I have duct taped the brush cylinder to the dryer but the metal areas get too hot for the tape to adhere. I am now looking to replace the dryer and not sure what to go to."
2,Poor quality product,"I bought this product a year ago and hardly used it (I'm not big on styling my hair, so only used it once or twice a month). The one time I really needed to blow dry my hair, it wouldn't turn on at all. I hadn't used it in about a month and it just stopped working completely. Reset it, checked my outlets, but it just stopped working. It looks cute, is really convenient to have, but is a poor investment. That, and I never did like how the picture showed a girl with perfect curls that for my type of hair (very thick) and I guess lack of styling skills was impossible for me to ever achieve with this product. My hair would just get tangled up and pull the brushes off the dryer. Haha. Lame."
1,snow beast,i remember this movie from the 70'sand really looked forward to seeing it.It's too bad it didn't happen.There was no picture or sound at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.I tried everything.still no luck.I didn't bother to send it back.The price of returning it was more than it was worth too me.Oh well maybe next time.
4,I'll never look at a string of pearls in quite the same way,"After perusing the editorial and customer reviews, along with the book cover, etc. I thought I was prepared for Thea Devine's Seductive. Way wrong. I remained confused until the hero's disguise was finally revealed, then went back and re-read the beginning, ah-so! Nicholas' feelings for Elizabeth are explained (to the reader anyway, not her) and we see that his... virility isn't his sole quality."
2,Disappointed,"This was my first Thea Divine book and I was so disappointed. The characters were so flat and shallow. The story was hard to follow. The erotica was a bit too explicit for me. I need a little romance mixed in.Nicholas the ""hero"" if he could be called that was a cold, calculating, jerk. I didn't warm up to him at all. I wanted the heroine to slap him not sleep with him!Overall- not a very good read."
1,Postively dreadful,"I wish I could give this book a negative number. Yes, its that bad.If poor character development, confused plotting, a wishy washy heroine, a cold and manipulative male leads and clinical repetitive sex scenes are your idea of a good read, this is the book for your. Otherwise, steer clear.I could not believe how bad this book was, especially in light of the great reviews here.My first and last book by Ms Devine."
1,Poor resolution,"I was very disappointed by the video quality. The color was oversaturated and the pictures lacked resolution. It looked like old footage being converted for DVD. The scenes, however, were lovely and peaceful. I would not buy again from this series."
5,Great Pasta pan,Love this pan. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Love the size and quality. We have already used it several times for different types of pasta and everything works just great with the steamer. Would recommend this product.
5,Really nice Docs!,"I've been wearing Docs for years mainly because of the way they look and the fact that they last forever. I was in the market for a new pair because my 1460s needed a break so I decided on this pair. I was concerned when I first put them on and started walking around because they felt really stiff and were uncomfortable on the tops of my feet as i took steps. I was close to sending them back, but decided to give it a while to see if they softened up which they did. After about 15 minutes or so of walking around they are very comfortable now with no pain. I normally wear a size 13 in running shoes, but docs tend to be a size bigger so I went with 12s and they fit just fine. These are really good looking and great quality!"
5,Great boots,"I wanted some comfortable boots and that's what I got....for this price in any local store all I could find were cowboy boots or cheaper brands of workbooks that I know don't last very long since I've tried them before.....I like the padding where your ankles hit, and I like the fact that I didn't need any comfort insert....they are easy on the sole and heel already....don't pinch my toes....look sharp....."
5,"Conception : ""In Your Multitude""","***** - FIVE STARS===================Very impressive Power Metal. Conception isn't that well known, but they should be, ""In Your Multitude"" had to be one of the best Metal offerings in 1995. This is highly underrated....If you like old-school Metal, in the realm of Queensryche / Iron Maiden / and various other pure Power Metal oufits, you should certainly enjoy all of Conception's catalogue....After listening to ""In Your Multitude"" I wondered why I had never hear of this band, and why they weren't respected more around the world. They are excellent musicians, and the vocals are incredibly unique. Vocalist R. Kahn sounds like no other singer in Metal, he's almost got a F. Mercury {Queen} sound that I can't quite describe. I love it though!!!...I highly recommend you pick this up, along with ""Parallel Minds"" and ""Flow"". You will not be disappointed...."
4,The Fantasic Harry Potter,Received this item on time. The set was in great condition except for dirt on outside box cover and smudges on inside paperback covers.I took a slightly damp cloth to the dirt and smudges and it cleaned up well. I would have appreciated not having the extra work but since this was a gift to a young friend all is well.
5,Mystical magic of a completely new kind!,"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter's series is, in my opinion, fabulous writing artwork. All three of her books, especially Prisoner of Azkaban, captured my mind from the start. The author uses her awesome imagination to create many new board games, an entirely new sport, and even pictures that move! She makes it sound so convincing that I started to hope that there really is an entire magic community out there. She combines stereotypical magic (the Abbracadabra kind) with a completely new kind of her own creation. She ends up with a very complete magical world. J.K. Rowling includes in all of her books an interesting variety of characters. By the end of each book, many of the well developed individuals have played a role in the story. Every one of these excellent books is an awesome read and well worth the time. The only thing I am concerned about is how long it will take before she writes another one"
4,Love It!!,"I love my cd(dreaming of you) that I have gotten. I recieved it today and listened to the whole thing. But the thing is, is that i need help finding a song that she sung the last time she performed. It was on the movie and it is a spanish song. She sung it a the astrodome towards the end of the movie the last time you see her in the purple outfit. She's singing and then when the song is about to end, she pauses and says the same line over twice and points to the drums and the drummer plays and shes rocking her head back and fourth. IF anyone can help me please I need to know what song that is. OH and by the way I am talking about the movie with J.Lo in it so actually you see J.Lo doing the things that I just described."
1,America Un-Just,"Plain and simple the video is a documentary from the Government's P.O.V. and seems to be made in the F.B.I and A.T.F. studio! So if you want a real documentary get ""Rules of Engagement"" After all it doesn't even study how the A.T.F. lied to get C.E.V's (Combat Engineer Vehicle),M.B.T.'s(Main Battle Tank)A.P.C.'s(armored Personel Carrier),UH-1's and OH-6's from Fort Hood in violation of the ""Posse Comitatus Act"" You Don't need to be a rocket scientist to know who attacked whom!"
5,Realistic and Humorous,I have worked in the food industry for many years and would recommend this book to those in the industry as well as those who enjoy dining. This book is very entertaining and enlightening. An absolute must read!
1,Don't Get It!,"I just don't get how this book can be rated so highly by reviewers. One of the author's annoying ""rules"" for diners is that they be concise when speaking to a waiter (""use an economy of words, as if every syllable spoken is a painful lash from a cat of nine tails...""). If only he would follow his own advice! Suffering through his endless metaphors and painful, wordy attempts at humor was, well, insufferable! It was like reading a short story written by a middle schooler who just got his first thesaurus (how's that for a metaphor!?). And the book is not funny. I can only guess that these other reviewers are friends or family because this book was a total waste of time and money!"
5,"Freddy Snakeskin, Boston, Massachusetts","For you people out there that have never worked in a restaurant, then you might think that Johnny ""Bananas"" is stretching and fabricating. It is OK to think that. But you're wrong. After sixteen years in this industry, as well as a college degree in restaurant management from one of those fancy Boston schools, I can and will assure you that these adventures are ultra-accurate in the restaurant world. These characters in the book are in every city in America. Sure they look like regular people, but underneath that ""Slot Machine World Series T-Shirt"" these are the characters in FINE DINING MADNESS coming to life. This book is clever, intelligent, witty and most of all, ultra-accurate.Mike"
5,touching and crying out loud funny.,"I rarely had the opportunity to laugh so hard, so often, while reading a book. And having been in the service industry for quite some time, john galloway is right on the money, everything's there. Very smart!"
2,Ehhh,It wasn't the 80's verison of the single. It was a 96 version and it had 5 tracks on it. All the tracks in my opinion really sucked compared to the 80's version and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone else.
1,Any Joe DiMaggio fan would be pleased by this book.,"As a lifelong baseball fan and Joe DiMaggio fan, I was most pleased by this book. The book moves along well and tells the Yankee Clipper story from the viewpoint of someone who knows his subject well. I believe any fan of DiMaggio and his era of baseball will thoroughly enjoy this work. I have read many DiMaggio books and this one is as good as any. I recommend it!"
1,Hello?..Nancy did you ever read the orginal Dragonlance?,Book was wrote decently...Would be a lot higher on my list if the characters had not been Tanis's Parents...All thoughout the orginal series of Dragonlace and even the follow-up in Legends did it tell the reader that Tanis's mother had been raped and died in childbirth.....the actual story itself I'd give 3 stars to but just knowing that it was a lie ticks me off....who are we to believe? The creators (Weis and Hickman) or Nancy?.....
1,Picture is inaccurate,The slippers they sent me do not look like the picture. Got a prepaid return label sent to me for the return.
5,Documentary Make-Up Autobiography,"This DVD left me with an understanding on why and how the Beauty Industry got its start and its lasting impact on women. The narrators Debi Mazar, Kathy Peiss, Helen Gurly Brown, A'lelia Bundles, Iman, Linda Wells, Naomi Wolf, and others moved this autobiography along many avenues such as marketing, distribution, and cultural dynamics."
2,Poor quality,"We thought this would be a great bag for either mom or dad to carry around. It does fit a lot and the pockets are handy, but the fabric that holds the string in ripped after less than 20 uses! This was a big problem since the velcro closure doesn't really work either. It was from our registry, but the store wouldn't take it back without the receipt, so it's now ""repaired"" but we'll see how long it will last. I'm shopping for a different one but am doing my research this time."
3,"Decent bag, good for hands-free, but there's better out ther","It's good bag. It worked fine for my son. It is hard to find things inside and it doesn't open far enough. Also doesn't have nearly enough pockets for organizing. There's no way I can still use this now that I have a toddler and baby. I'm looking for an alternative backpack that has more compartments and opens wider. I'd suggest buying something else. I know there's better ones out there, especially at this price."
2,Disappointed,"We received this diaper bag as a gift so I returned the bag that I'd picked out myself. What a mistake! This will quicly become a high-ticket garage sale item. It does hold a large amount of diapers et al, but it's very hard to keep organized. You have to pull out the top layers to get to items on the bottom. Pretty much useless!"
2,Not thrilled for the price,"We registered for this bag based on the recommendations of a number of people. My husband thinks it's okay. I find it highly annoying. After about 6 months of occasional use, the elastic pull cord that keeps the top opening shut wore out and so did the velcro that keeps the top flap shut. Also, even when the velcro was in good shape, it was not able to keep the top shut if the bag was rather full. It's very inconvenient to have to dig to the bottom of the bag for a diaper. Another thing is that the straps do not easily adjust. The outside pocket does not fit my Gerber Color Change sippy cups so I have to put them in the top and since it does not close well, I can't tell you how many times I have lost a sippy cup under the car because it rolled out the top when I bent over to hold my daughter's hand. The only plus is that it does hold an awful lot of diapers, wipes, clothing, and anything you'd need. Big, yes. Convenient, no."
1,Lining tears out,"I really liked parts of this diaper bag, but the lining where the drawstring pulls through at the top tore out within just a few months of using it. I liked that it was a large diaper bag that has held everything to date (our baby is 11 mo old now), the changing pad is a good size, there is a dirty duds pouch that zips, and there are lots of pockets. However, the lining tearing out in the place it did makes it TERRIBLY inconvenient to use, so now I'm having to replace it. I'm disappointed, because I expected more from this brand name."
3,"Decent, But Plenty of Room for Improvement","This is a good bag, especially when your baby is younger and you don't need as much (or smaller) stuff. The pockets are well-designed, and it's easy to get in/out of. My biggest gripe is it doesn't close very well when full or even semi-full--the top flaps over onto a very small velcro strip which often comes undone. Also, the drawstring means you have to use two hands to draw it close. When does a new parent *ever* have both hands available?"
2,Gotta be a better backpack diaper bag!,"I, too, thought a backpack diaper bag would be most convenient, but this one isn't. I have never been able to carry what I want & be able to close the top! It always seemed to be misshaped, and it was hard to tuck into my stroller basket. Bottles don't fit in the side pocket (my storebought water bottles).I was really disappointed, because I've always trusted Eddie Bauer products."
3,OK backpack,"I received this bag as a gift. I do like it. It holds a lot of things, but I have found that it is really cumbersome for quick trips to the store or going to visit someone. I have had a few problems with the bag too. I can only fit one bottle on the side when the bag is filled. I also have a hard time keeping it closed. I have had things fall out of the top several times, which is VERY frustrating. I also like to carry the bag over only one shoulder (like a lot of people do), but it will not stay on very well and slips off easily. If you want to have a bag that fits a lot and you want to wear it only as a backpack, I would recommend it."
2,"It's okay, but not worth the money.","With Eddie Bauer you pay for the name. This backpack is nice because of the outside pockets, but it is too small and not as functional as it could be. I definitely recommend a backpack for carrying all of the baby needs and yours too. If I am out with my son (even now that he is 2 1/2), I always bring a backpack. Your hands are free and you can stash your wallet, water bottle and all of those baby and toddler bottles, cups, snacks and diapers. For an infant I also carry a thermos (about the 160z size)of very warm, not hot bottled or filtered water. This is perfect for making bottles in the car or anywhere finding clean water is a problem. Like baseball games, the mall etc. You don't have to heat the water maybe just cool it off a little if it's too warm directly from the thermos. I made the mistake of putting boiling water in the Thermos. It was WAY too hot when it was bottle time. I learned my lesson from then on. Very warm water works best."
1,Nice tunes but NOT SOOTHING ENOUGH for babies!!!,"I love a lot of the pieces on here so I had high hopes for using this as bedtime music for my baby. Two MAJOR problems:1) Some of the songs are start with nice soft soothing music and then bridge into bold robust pounding sections that will shake anyone awake!2) The lazy publishers of this disc set did not bother to balance the sound from track to track, so there are some tracks that are MUCH louder than others, again, shakes me and baby both awake in the middle of listening. ARRRGH!!!Both of these would have been easy fixes if someone wasn't just out to make a buck without putting in a little effort to ""curate"" the album. So disapointing."
2,"Informatve, but a tough slog","I rarely give up on a book about a vital topic that's chock full of fascinating information, but I did reluctantly abandon this one. To call Ahmed's prose style academic is to denigrate academic writing. Her writing is, at least for this reader, dense, deadly and deadening, a tough slog that eventually wore me down. I can't tell you how it ends. Sorry."
2,"Good idea, poorly executed","The idea behind this movie is pretty good: What if the military could trap a supernatural entity? Of course, they'd have scientists study it. Where this film goes wrong is that there's little thought beyond that premise. Stupid characters doing stupid things describes the middle part. The ending has a nice twist, tho."
2,Patronizing and Plebeian,"One out of ten quotes is OK. One out of twenty, maybe, is good. Most of these quotes suffer from a lack of direct application. They are mainly just platitudes. I'd rather be told how to FIX a problem than be given a pat on the back and told it's ""going to be all right"". The editor of this book obviously has a different Idea than I do of what constitutes good advice."
5,Plain & Simple but VERY POWERFUL,"This book provides a great base knowledge, in the practical understanding of TCP/IP structure. It quickly builds on basic IP addressing concepts, and ties in Subnets, and DNS information very, very well. Thank you for a GREAT book and lifetime reference. One of the books core points that 90 to 95% of networking issues are caused by IP problems, will allow you to solve many of your issues, through focusing on this book."
5,FANTASTIC STUDY ON ABRAHAM,OUR GROUP HAS BEEN INSPIRED BY THE STUDY OF THIS BOOK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL BIBLE CLASSES.
3,A Fine Historical Romance Set in an Unusual Time Period,"LADY IN WHITE is a quick read set in Elizabethan England (picture SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, minus the depressing ending and spews of poetry). Lady Arabella Purfoy has been maneuvered into a marriage with a reclusive squire she's never met by the Virgin Queen Herself, only to find herself completely heels over head in love with the man's steward.The book doesn't overplay either the relationship between Belle and the steward, nor the political intrigue that surrounded the Elizabethan court before the death of Mary, Queen of Scots.While the book was enjoyable for a light read, and one is glad to see the hero and heroine together in the end, the novel doesn't pack any emotional punches, even at key moments in the story, and there are very few surprizes. Not a work of genius, but a good and satisfying work nonetheless."
2,Canned Soup and More Soup`,"Coming from South Louisiana (Cajun Country) I had high hopes from the title of this cookbook. However, after reading some of the recipes, I am astonished at astounding quantity of canned creamed soups called for in so many of them. Real Cajun cooks must be laughing themselves silly. Cajun cooking does not begin with CANNED SOUP! Get yourself a real Cajun cookbook. This is not it! Read it for the ""remembrances,"" but certainly not the recipes. Apparently the Fontenot clan hasn't a clue about Cajun cooking."
3,A book about a prophecy and technology,"This is an interesting book about what happens when a rift which connects many worlds brings both technology and magic into a single world. This is not one of the best of Piers Anthony's novels, and yet it would be enjoyable to anyone who likes the concept of gloves of stregnth, swords, ray guns, and jet packs all in one. Makes for one interesting book, but definately not on par with some of the series that Piers Anthony has created."
4,Pink business card holder,Pink Hardcase Business Card HolderShipping time was really fast. Had it 4 days after placing order. Item was not exactly like picture - darker pink with white pattern - but very nice.
5,Creepy!,"Loosely based on real-life murders, this book comes highly recommended from me. I was irked to my soul when I read this one, and had a hard time falling asleep. You might need a night light after you read the daughter's perspective of things. Ending was sheer brilliance."
1,wrong product sent,I ordered this item because they said it would fit my cell phone and when i got the produce the packaging it can with had other nokia phones listed but not mine. it doesn't fit. Look at your listing! the nokia 6255i is there but not listed on your product info and DOES NOT FIT THIS PHONE. please make sure you know what you are listing before you list it.
4,Micromanagement fun!,"This is a pretty old game, so you probably won't be impressed with the graphics. I played this about 10 years ago and still love it.Basically you manage a hospital. You are responsible for building different types of rooms, hiring nurses/doctors/handymen/receptionists, and control your in and outflow of money.I'm not sure how many levels there are since I've never beaten the game, but there seem to be plenty. In order to move onto the next level you will have to meet the goal of curing a certain number of patients, maintaining your popularity, and earning a certain amount of money. Sometimes the game throws in curve balls in the harder levels such as epidemics.I cannot think of what other game this game is similar to, but if you like micromanagement and challenges, then you should probably give this a try. But don't forget, this is a pretty old game so you may not have the control and graphics of today!"
3,Ok but not what I thought,It is entertaining but it is boring. If your a collector of all things mustang like I am it's worth having but you won't learn anything new.
4,Another good installment from Mrs. Albert,China gets involved with a serious issue and a murder. This is a good installment from Susan Whitig Albert. Several secondary characters make an appearance as there are two mysteries in one in this book. Highly recommended.
3,overall happy in the end,had to send the first one back due to defective discs but recieved a replacement promptly without any problems. Seller won't answer emails which is annoying.
1,nautica belt,"i have a thirty six inch waist and the belt would have fit 34 or 35 with comfort, NOT A THIRTY SIX inch waist. I was able to use because I was able to use ONE belt hole and had no time to return the belt."
3,Fun games,"I bought this book for a group of us to do the exercises together on a weekly basis. It was a great starting off point, but we found after several meetings, some of the games were a little corny and were not providing the material we had expected. In general a good starter book for those who have never had any experience with imagery, meditation, and journeying. But if you are well versed in these things, while this book is fun, the exercises may seem pretty elementary."
1,Very Unreliable Laptop!,I have gone through 5 of these in the last 2 years. My work provides them to me. Every single one has had problems with the mouse touchpad. It will randomly jump all over when you lift your finger. Sometimes will not happen for a couple weeks but sometimes happens several times in a day and you need to reset touchpad in control panel to get it to work again. They have all run poorly but that could be a Windows / software issue. Overall they have all been plagued with problems and I would never buy one for myself. In contrast my Mac laptop works fine all the time. Stay away from the nc6000 as HP support could not resolve my touchpad issues and support from HP is not very good to begin with.
1,Leaky and noisy,"I would agree with the reviewer who said that these caps are noisy. We ruined a camera by putting it in a bag with one of these lids on a klean kanteen bottle. I wrote to klean kanteen warranty, and this was their response ""We are sorry to hear that but we do advertise that our sports caps are not leak proof.""Bottles are great - don't buy this version of the sports cap."
5,Knitting Mom,After reading the fiction book this gave me so much more information and added a great deal of information. I really enjoyed reading all the history that went into creating each room and it made seeing them in person at the Art Institute even more enjoyable. The cost on Amazon was so much better that buying it at the Art Institute.
2,I should have got the waistbelt,"I have the neck pack. i like it, but it bulges out my shirt. My friend has the waist belt, it is much more hidden."
1,Very bad quality!,"The idea of the product is good. Unfortunately, the quality is bad, though. I got as far as to the airport when the strap ripped off. I ended up having to carry it in my hand for the entire trip and finally was able to fix it a the destination.Also, the plastic insert keeps sliding around as it is only inserted and makes it hard to remove passports and other I.D.'s.I was very disappointed in this and DO NOT recommend it."
3,Silk Holder,The Rick Steves Silk holder served it's purpose although the plastic inside the holder seemed to get in the way of putting things in the holder.
4,Silk Neck Wallet,My daughter used this on her trip to Spain and it worked out well! It is lightweight and easily concealed.
3,Not for Tropical Climates,"I have a leather travel wallet that I used on two previous trips to southern China. My family got me the Rick Steve's wallet and I took it on my third trip, instead of the leather one. In the subtropical/tropical climate the silk wallet became so saturated with sweat within an hour of putting it on that by mid-day it was toxic waste. I would take it off and dry it out at naptime and wash it at night when the smell gave it away. It may be a good idea for cool climates, but I am leaving it home now. The leather one works whether the climate is hot or cold."
1,not durable,The string broke off before my plane landed. The zipper broke off. The adjustable string didn't stay the length I chose because the string was too slippery.
3,it worked,"bought for our trip to ireland the neck wallet was worn under my shirt and around my neck. it easily held our passports, euro's and flight info. the thin strap was the only downside. it started to annoy me after a few days. overall, not bad."
2,"Average, but you can to better","The autofocus on this lens is much too slow. In addition, the aperture doesn't allow enough light it. The lense would be useful for a beginner, but I would invest a bit more in a more solid lense with a lower aperture setting. Pentax offers hundreds of thousands of quality used lenses."
2,Disappointing,"lite-bluegrass, newgrass, either way this doesn't do justice to either bluegrass music or Neil Young. Another review wondered if Neil has heard this, and I hope he hasn't. This is best reserved for an elevator, or background music for an SUV ad."
5,Bluegrass,This album is so awesome! I would refer it to anyone that enjoys Neil Young and/or Bluegrass music.Thank You
1,"Watch out for same album, different titles","This album is the same as the album titled ""Pickin' On Neil Young"" and ""The Ultimate Pickin' On Neil Young"" though the last one has three extra tracks tacked onto the end:15. Rockin' The Free World16. Country Girl17. Harvest MoonIt isn't a bad compilation, but sort of Bluegrqss elevator music. Not worth paying for three times though!"
4,"Works Great, but come on AAA Batteries.","First off using this is real easy, but if you want one of these make sure to get like 2 AAA batteries, because thats what it takes. I love the vibration it gives off in the n64 controller is great. When the batteries are low you will feel a low vibration after the first one. As you put in your batteries face the light side up and slide it in, it will fit. Overall its great accept for the fact it takes batteries."
3,"Still good, but deja vu from the first","I own the first book, and have used a zillion times, great ideas and really no complaints. This second addition is very similar, some of the recipes are almost carbon copies of the ones from the first book. I guess I had higher hopes of this second addition because the first had been so great. I'm a little disappointed, but still have found some new ideas useful. If you love the first, I'd suggest getting the second out of the library before purchasing, to see if it would be worth it for you."
4,Kid c oncoctions 2,"Great book for teachers and parents. any one who cares for and wants high quality, inexpensive and fun activities to do with their kids. I use it all the time. I love it."
5,Worth Reading and Re-reading,"Though it seems to go against popular opinion, this is my favorite of all of Delillo's books. The language (and the meta-obsession with language) rings most true here. All choices seem precise, and well combined: from place choices, language choices, historical evidences. Maybe I'm most taken by this novel because of its self-location among mythologies, but it definitely works. Delillo has a tendency to wax poetic/philosophical, which can seem heavy-handed in other works (The Players, The Body Artist), but flow perfectly here with the landscape of the novel. This is one novel I read repetedly, and I always find it lyrical and profound. On par with the best of his works -- White Noise & Underworld -- and reminiscent of John Fowles The Magus. Really, a tremendous novel."
5,Breakfast Sandwiches on the Go,"Buying breakfast on the way to work is very convenient, and expensive. 3 bucks a day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks a year adds up. Sure, it's not thousands, but if you watch your pennies, the dollars take care of themselves. And this is why I bought these egg rings: breakfast biscuits. I can make 4 breakfast biscuits with sausage, ham or bacon and cheese for 2 bucks plus my time to cook and clean. I wrap 'em up at night after dinner, and put them in the freezer for a week's worth of breakfast on the go. These rings also do a great job of poaching eggs as well. Just don't forget to wipe the inside of each ring with a bit of oil so the eggs don't stick. These rings are everything I wanted, and they work perfectly."
3,Eh...,"I've had these for a couple years. I used them on a flat griddle to cook eggs, but every single time they did not contain the egg, which just oozed from underneath. So far, I have used them more as round cookie cutters."
2,They leak & stick,"The first time I used them, the egg stayed inside but even with greasing, the inner portion, the egg stuck to it. The second time I used it, the egg ran out from underneath and stuck again after greasing, not impressed at all with these."
3,too hot to handle,"the idea to keep eggs cooking in small circle for sandwiches is good but be careful, the handles get hot quick"
3,Won't happen but you're on the right track.,"From a guy who loves and knows MANY beautiful women. You will never be able to make every girl want you - even if you are rich and famous. But it's a good idea for you to read this book AND all of the others about dating. Read about all the different tactics (this is a must), search the web, then TAKE ONE THING HOME: Do something, do anything - just DO IT and DO IT NOW - talk to women, meet them everyday, everywhere. There are no other tricks or secrets. Pick up lines don't work. Here is the best and only one-liner on earth you ever need: ""Hi!""."
1,too bad there isn't a zero stars option,"This book was a big waste of time/money. The premise of the book is make friends with girls, be their therapist/doormat and wait for them to ""attack"" you for relationship/sex. Been there done that. I have had many close female friends over the years and have done ALL the things this book said to do/ not do. I have never had one of them EVER ""attack"" me. Instead, they continued to treat me like the doormat/therapist/friend and go out with the more aggressive types.Buy a REAL book like ""Nice Guys and Players"" by Rom Wills"
1,Skynyrd muzak?,"No thanks! Glad I borrowed this CD from a friend & didn't waste MY money on it. Bland at best, there's certainly many other actual ""Skynyrd"" titles to spend YOUR'S on. Any of them!"
1,It breaks easily,I bought it in September 2011. One of the hinges broke off from the fake wood back panel in April 2012. I was very careful with it because it already looked quite flimsy. That means I never sat on it. I did open it daily to store blankets. I am replacing it with a real wood much more expensive one tailor made. I hope that one will last.
3,"first disc was great, second scared me","Relationships are important! This is the message of the first disc which covers secure attachment and partnerships.The second disc seemed to recommend some scary solutions for those with fears: therapies that forced people to recount, relive and repeat their traumas, including the painful retelling of their war experiences, repeatedly watching ""full metal jacket,"" and shock therapy. Certainly the mental health industry (and holistic!) provide safer approaches. For example,Holographic Reprocessing: A Cognitive-Experiential Psychotherapy for the Treatment of Traumawhich appears to have wide endorsement by health professionals.I did not continue on to disc 3..."
4,My Husband's Gift!,"Was looking for this item online to no avail. We thought this was in Italian, so, we agreed to purchase even though we don't speak Italian. When we recieved it we were so suprised it was in English and were totally pleased. Thanks to this seller this VHS was in perfect shape and more than we expected!"
2,ONE MORE THING...,There is nothing in the movie that looks anything like what's on the front of the box. The box looks like bizarre fantasy. The movie is strictly caveman.
1,This file is corrupted. The last third of it is unplayable.,"Don't even bother with this episode. The file is corrupted, and you will be left hanging. It wasn't that good anyway; just skip it and go to the next."
4,A Chakotay character building episode,"If you like Chakotay, then this is a must watch episode. It doesn't really add anything to the main story line, but it is essential as a character building episode to better understand Commander Chakotay, and reveals that aliens have been visiting Earth for far longer than anyone thought and have had a significant impact on Earth's history.Keep on Treking!"
3,"If you don't know what it is, don't touch it!","Another Star Trek lesson of why you follow the Prime Directive. Such a good story, ruined by a low budget. They had Jonathan Frakes at the helm, but this just didn't deliver. Pros: The last 10 minutes was pretty good, and the ship is in danger. Watch it if you have to watch every episode. The acting wasn't up to par either. (I found myself playing MW3 on another screen the first half of it). 3.2/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
1,Great Show - Could Paramount is either too lazy or too greedy?,"Look at the prices on a seasons sci-fi set now a days.Paramount has to be crazy to keep the price this high for a show that was great in its time but there are better now. If you buy it for this price, I can give you number for a phychologist. You can afford to have your mind examined."
5,Season 2 On the way,"I personally found season 2 to be excellent. So much happens and you get even more familiar with the crew. You see how the Maquis and Star Fleet work together more and more. Not to mention the arrival of Seska again with the Kazon. Just wait until you see Basics Part I where Voyager is stolen by the Kazon and the crew is stranded on a volotile planet. And to top it all off Voyager's best hope lies in a The Doctor, a murderer, and Tom Paris. There is so much to look forward to in season 2. And if this is your first time seeing it your in for the greatest ride fo your life.But wait it gets better hwne season 3 arrives :)"
4,Not the original but entertaining,"The formula used for the original and all other Star Treks is used here, with it's own twist. Jane Way puts her hands on her hips wayyyyy to much."
4,"Good Q, but not great Q -- 3.5/5","If I had never seen Star Trek TNG before watching this episode I'd probably give it a 5. But Knowing how awesome the Q episodes were from TNG and remembering the amazing dynamic between he and Picard had makes this episode fall flat just a bit.I mainly attribute this to Janeway, and her lack of chemistry on screen with the Q's. There was just something about her performance in this episode that annoyed me to tears. I think it's cause most of the time she is doing ""The Rock"" eyebrow stare as a substitute for acting. And you see a lot of that here because almost everyone else is absent (no B'Elanna, Chakotay, Kes, Paris, etc)But my personal nit-picking aside it's still enjoyable and I recommend watching it. Also to anyone who thinks this is an amazing episode also go watch the TNG Q episodes....they will probably blow your socks off all the way to the delta quadrant."
3,Harry Kim and the Alternate Universe,"It's a Harry Episode! Which I love. Too bad it's a forgettable one. The whole thing is just a big mystery, and not well executed. Meeting Harry's ex-girl was interesting, but his actions to her were cold compared to other performances. The ending is uneventful and the story is not put together right. I found myself on 2x during half of it. I give it 2.9/5 Stars. See it only if you have to see every Voyager episode. (where's the Xbox?)~Keep On Trekkin'"
2,Poor Harry...,"Harry did a pretty good job acting in this poorly scripted episode. The idea is interesting, but it was written very badly. It also didn't help that his love interest was one of the worst extra actors to be cast.All that said, it is still worth watching.....barely. Like us, you may just feel awkward and self conscious (like most of the actors in this episode)."
3,Great Third Party Pad,"The Dream Pad is the best third-party controller available for Dreamcast. First and foremost, it has the extra Z & C buttons that we've all been longing for. The Z & C buttons mirror, respsectively, the left and right analog triggers. This is great for fighting games. Mad Catz, for the most part, has put rubber to good use here. You'll find rubber grips on the sides of the controller, rubber buttons, rubberized coating on the analog stick, and the one place where it doesn't work too well, a completely rubberized D-pad. Ouch. It just feels awkward, and its incredibly difficult to slide your fingers across it. Another minor flaw, the analog triggers are extremely cheap, as my Dream Pad's triggers only lasted 2 months before resting in peace. But of course, you have the C & Z buttons to take their place if need be. If you can't stand Sega's standard controller, this is a nice alternative, but the D-pad and the analog triggers bring this score down. GRADE : B-"
3,"ok controler, could be better",The rubber grips and analog stick along with its larger size make it much more comfortable than the stock controler. some people complained about the triggers breaking. i never had this problem. however sometimes it would not read my memory card. i had to remove and reinsert it several times for it to work. it did not do this all the time but still a bad flaw.
2,Bad Description,"The picture displaying the product doesnt show the ugly big plastic piece that holds the hood down on the feeder. If i would of known that I would of not purchased but, I didnt send back broke the plastic piece off and have hade no issues so far."
1,Cost too high.,The prime cost is $10 dollars more than it cost from HD. I would buy this elsewhere and save $10.
2,Dull,"There are many, many, many good books on how to draw faces. This isn't one of them. The illustrations lead you to believe that the guy has a hard time drawing himself. I was very disappointed."
2,Only the picture on the website looks good,"The picture on the website for the watch looks pretty stylish, but in reality it is not.I have nothing good to add about the watch, except that it is a regular time piece, however some of the things that I did not expect are:1) The dial of the watch was covered with a blackish/greyish paint/polish layer. This made the watch look pretty bad. Now after an occasional use, this polish layer is peeling off, to reveal the metal beneath. These patches of paint/metal have further made the watch look bad.2) The edges of the clasp for the bracelet are pretty sharp and you may accidentally cut yourself, if not careful.3) Overall, the watch looks like one purchased off the roadside vendor (basically the watch looks pretty cheap)Based on the piece that I got, I would advise you guys to stay away from this model."
5,Couldn't put it down,"A while ago,I bought this book after reading some high praise for it on a message board. It went into my to-be-read pile, where it languished for some months while I worked my way down through previous purchases.Then yesterday evening I started into it. And couldn't stop (except for necessities) till I'd finished it, far later than I'd intended to stay up. It was well-written, illuminated by early film history without a whiff of dustiness, illustrated with a marvelous collection of images, and best of all, took the Theda Bara I'd known only from campy college posters and revealed the delightful, complex woman behind the image.Highly, highly recommended, and has spurred me on to buy Eve Golden's other books, and to hover by my mailbox in keen anticipation of their delivery."
3,"Great photographs, but very little substance.","""Vamp"" was a disappointment on several levels. I read the book in hopes of gaining insight into the life of one of the cinema's true icons, but was frustrated to discover that the narrative merely glossed over Bara's personal life. Furthermore, the anecdotes and stories behind her film career were no more insightful than most of the stories written in the fan magazines of the era.The photographs were the saving grace of the book. Rarely seen, the photographs provided a look at the woman that the narrative failed to support.""Vamp"" is a wonderful introduction to Bara for those who aren't familiar with her work, but for those who want to know more of her life's story, this isn't the book for them."
2,Lacking in content and usefulness,"While I'm in general a fan of the ""step by step"" series from MS Press, this book is a big disappointment.The audience of this book is clearly laptop and tablet beginning users, folks who need a little handholding in getting the most of their hardware. While the book promises a lot -- ""set up your own wi-fi!"" and ""take your laptop to the beach!"" -- it falls short in delivering useful guidance. The chapter on wireless is way too short and leaves out all the important details a beginner needs in order to get things set up. Would you believe that the whole write-up on Bluetooth, the most notoriously difficult technology on the planet right now, consists of just two paragraphs?This thin volume is pretty much a waste of money. If you want to a get-started book on laptops and tablets, check out the ""How to do everything"" series, or even -- oh, no, I can't believe I'm saying this -- a Dummies book."
5,Outstanding original pop rock music,This cd is further proof that major labels have no clue! Minster Hill records for an independent company I have never heard of (SomeWhere But Hear) but.... what an amazing release by a band I previously I had never heard of. This is original pop rock (ala The Beatles and Jellyfish)music blending world instruments and outstanding lyrics to come up with one of the best cd's of this or any other year for the last 10-15 years. Get this cd now!!!
4,Pretty good for a quick Halloween costume with a popular character,"Its good, very colorful and fits very good. You might need to do little ajustments but overall good."
4,not as good as her first,"My favorite songs on this disc are ""Walking on Music,"" ""Magic Touch,"" ""Power of Love,"" ""Lift Me Up"" and the one that sounds like Donna Summer. My friend thinks it's hot to listen to while cruising along the highway. It's difficult to hear or buy Corona in this country."
2,Don't Be Fooled!,"This video is not for those who want a real workout. First of all, despite it's ""hip hop"" claim, the music is a throwback to early 80's street hop, not at all what you might expect. Second, the dance moves are extremely complicated. I used this video for months and STILL have yet to master the routine here. Third, the impact it provides isn't even worth all the effort. I seriously question the aerobic value of this program. The good thing is that if you can learn the steps, the dance is pretty fun and I felt great doing such a complicated routine. But be warned that the music is iffy, the moves difficult to learn and the overall impact and effect is just not really worth it."
5,Quesadilla Maker,Already own one of these and use it all the time! The price was so low i ordered two for Christmas presents! Love it! Fast and easy snack maker! Thanks for the quick delivery!
2,Difficult to keep clean,"I was very excited to get this, but only ended up using it twice. The first time I forgot to clean it right away - when I went to use it again the non-stick spray that I used was REALLY stuck on there. Since you can not remove the plates to clean them, this was a pain to scrub. I still haven't been able to get it as clean as it should be. Not worth the price."
1,Broke within 2 months of purchase.,"I have had three of these because I love using them, but they have never lasted more than a couple of months of occasional use. Twice the chili latch broke, and this time the back hinge broke. Instead of this brand maybe I'll try the George Foreman quesadilla maker."
4,Great!,"Works great...really impressed. Especially for the price. The only reason why I gave this product a 4 out of 5 is that I wish that I could put slightly more items in the quesodilla (1/2"" sound like plenty...put it fills up fast!)"
5,Excellent printer,"I love this printer. It's fast, toner life is amazingly long and the toner price is a lot lower than other competitors. Overall this network printer is the best value for your money. HP, Sharp are overpriced and worse in performance compared to comparable brother like this one.I had both in the past. Both disappointed me badly."
5,Photography Book Review,"The book realy helps you to see things different, also the book was is great condition (Used) when it arrived."
1,Horrible!,"Right out of the box it would not work, for over a month now I have been calling and emailing the company who advertises a 3 year warantee right on the box. I have only gotten thru one to actually speak to some one who had me fax some info and told me he would email me back.......I am still waiting! I called for over 17 minutes yesterday and could not get a hold of a single person, and still today nothing. Do not buy anything from Simpletech. I feel like I have been robbed of my money."
2,Piece of Junk - Not grounded - Static electricity will restart it.,"I bought this drive in the Winter and my house is pretty dry. Every time I touch it and get a static electricity zap the drive disconnects and reconnects. That, of course, disrupts and operation. The metal (metalized plastic?) case is not grounded.The problem was so bad I actually made a ground wire and grounded the case. The problem is fixed, but this product is junk.When it is not restarting it works fine. The speed is good over USB 2.0. For these reasons I gave it 2 stars instead of one.I recently bought a second drive (a Seagate) and it does not have this problem. I recommend avoiding drive from this company until their engineers take a short course on basic grounding theory."
1,SimpleTech SimpleDrive 250 - Thumbs Down,"Pros:One Touch BackupCons:Restore doesn't work.Comments:I purchased a SimpleTech 250GB external SimpleDrive, attracted by the advertisement of ""one touch backup"". The one touch backup worked, but that is where it stopped.When I attempted to restore the backed up data from the SimpleDrive, no luck. I attempted to get help from SimpleTech by phone and on-line support request for almost a week before I finally got a response, which did not answer my questions. I couldn't find the chat line advertised, or any product manual of any substance. I'm sure that if I were a techie I might not have trouble restoring my data. I'm searching the internet as we speak to find helpful instructions, which should be available on the SimpleTech web site.BOTTOM LINE: if you want a data backup product with decent customer service, I would suggest going elsewhere."
2,Not always there!,"I purchased this drive with great expections. From the outset, it looked good, worked right away when plugged in to Windows 2000. I purchased this as an extra storage, so i moved my data over and created a network share on it. It worked nicely, I could connect from another computer. So far so good.A day passed; i tried to use the share drive again; no where to be found. When I tried to use the drive from the connected computer - page fault error!. I had to reboot the machine to get the darn thing being recognized again So now everytime I need to use this darn drive after a day or two, I had to reboot the machine.Don't buy it if you want to use it as an extra on-line stroage. Buy Western Digital is better!"
1,"Will Die, Don't Buy","It's very simple, everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this drive, 4 USB sticks, 3 SD cards, and 1 CF card. Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache.Don't go for something cheap. Remember, once this drive fails you will need to pay about $300 to get your files recovered for a hard drive of this size so ask yourself if that's worth it. I know because I'm in the process of doing this now to restore precious photos."
2,ok till it breaks,"I like it, but when I really needed it, windows machines would notrecognize it, macs said they can't read it - and offer to format it."
4,Multi Voltage Requirement,"Truely out of the box, working superbly, couldn't have been easier, but only if you live in the USA...I had to call on my local electronics store and buy a multi voltage, multi amp convertor as soon as I had left the States.Would it economically feasible to add a multi volt power adapter for those of us ""over the Pond"""
1,Dont' buy it!!,I purchased the model with the network interface. Within 8 months the system has completely stopped working! It would routinely drop the network interface requiring a restart of the drive. Now it will not restart at all.No response from the company to date on repairs.
4,"it is useful, but has some slight bugs.",this device is good so far and has a lot of space for a good price. some usb 2.0 drives will have a little trouble detecting it at certain times. but as long as you have windows xp however it seems to work good enough. you may have to restart your computer sometimes so that it connects properly.
1,outdated,"I understand this book was written in 69, but we really dont handle anything the way the author made it seem. I am wondering if he was anti war. But if you know anything on how the US deals with hostage situations you wil be rather dissapointed with this book."
3,Outdated,This is the easiest book to use to evaluate the value of your donations for tax purposes .Unfortunately this edition is quite outdated so I have had to purchase another book which turned out to be more time consuming than the format of IT'S DEDUCTIBLE .Was sorry that a current edition was not available as I really like the format !
1,This is a terrible gun,"Right out of the package the directions are abosolutly horrible. The package it came in was destroyed. My package arrive at least a week late! The inside of the gun was rusted. You can load 30 pellets but it only shoots 11 pellets and I tried at least 12 times. For this I should have just gotten the pistol. Tried to contact them no number, and when I tried to do the e-mail thing, well it's been about 2 or 3 months and still they haven't sent anything back. don't waste your time don't buy."
5,I LOVE MY STEAM PRESS,"Not only has this press cut down my ironing time, I catch my husband ironing with it.The press is small enough to keep in our laundry room, I press our shorts, slacks, my child's school skorts and even my cotton robe.The steam is a very good burst or you can just spray from the bottle that is included.If you are thinking of buying this steam press do it today!"
2,over one year now and...,"have had this product for over one year now and the entire time this has been a real challenge to use. the first problem is the padding just is not sufficient enough meaning you get an imprint of what is below or above the padding. okay we put a folded sheet there to reduce that problem. it takes awhile to heat up and the the steam doesnt come out very strong. never could get the unit to make a sharp/crisp crease. while we knew the length before purchase, in real life use, we found it wasnt long enough. it did a decent job of pressing little kids clothes but anything larger than that was like putting together a jigsaw puzzle - so this unti wasnt a time saver for us. although we were excited to have in initially the excitment over time turned to frustration towards the end. we still use it but on a very limited basis. while not giving it high marks or a glowing review this does not mean it cant work for you."
1,Tinkerbell Night Light Fire Hazard,"Our daughter absolutly loved this light, however, the first night we had it, we discovered that the light bulb in the lamp was touching the blue plastic base and it almost caught on fire. We could have received a flawed unit or perhaps one that was manufactured incorrectly, but it could have cost us our house or our lives. The problem was that there is a hole in the top of the blue plastic that tinkerbell sits upon. There is also a hole in the bottom of the blue plastic that the light bulb goes through. The holes were not centered directly above one another. The hole on the top of the base was offset to one side, so when the bulb is put in place, it touches the blue plastic creating the problem. I would consider this one a fire hazard."
4,what the corpse revealed,"A throughly enjoyable book on murder investigations involving forensic science (especially at the low Amazon price). Well written and easy to read. More facinating than many mystery stories since there were no ""red herrings"", all the evidence was there to be discovered and presented by the forensic scientist."
4,A DEFINITE COMPLIMENT TO YOUR COLLECTION,"First I want to say, I feel a bit guilty (not much though) being sooo critical on DR. BADEN's latest, when I read this one long before. It does not have a lot of the nitty gritty (bugs and bones)BUT you still need to read this book. It is easy reading and the 'Missing' chapter was a....well, I can't think of the words...YOU HAVE GOT TO READ IT. I'd love to give it away...but when your all tucked in under your ""bankies"" and the cat is keeping your spine misaligned-you'll be glad I didn't."
3,well done reserch,"The information presented in this book help anyone to understand the needs of the various communities of people who are blind and those with low vision. This is a well done survey research to choose features that could be used by people who are visually disabled to recognize, denominate, and authenticate banknotes."
5,MuSt ReAd ReViEw,"OK so you're browsing the isles looking for a controller for your House Of The Dead 2 video game(or other shooting game), and you stumble across 2 different shooting controllers one is InterAct the other is MaddCatz (I own both).Obviously you have a decision to make. Lets take a look at the Features..MadCatz:smaller,a grip,better control,better accuracy, better buttons, easier manuvering between modes. InterAct:Just a piece of crap put together a waste of time and money the buttons suck, there is no grip, it is gruesomely oversized, and to top it off the accuracy is about as good as a blind woman trying to shoot you. Bottom Line you have to buy the MaddCatz gun if you want the best because this is the best. If i see find a better gun i will retract this review so you as a consumer won't have to be worried about outdated reviews. Just buy the controller and you will see. If you have any questions or comments..."
3,Decent military whodunnit...,"Airplane-level reading. Reasonably good concept, though ultimately the suspense was lacking"
1,The General,"The General written by Patrick A. Davis is a thriller at its best. Lieutenant Colonel Charles Jenson is put in charge of finding out who killed General Watkins. That is not an easy task considering there is not much help from the army and Air Force. If the truth ever came out the United States of America would be in serious trouble. As Colonel Jenson investigates the murder he runs into all sorts of problems. For one, General Watkins was working on an investigation of POWs in Vietnam. The information he learned from the investigation very well could have got him killed. As time passes there are even a few more homicides. Will Colonel Jenson ever find the killer?Patrick A. Davis is a retired Air Force Colonel. He is a full time writer and has three books out right now. They are: The General, the Colonel, and The Passenger. All are exceptional mystery novels."
2,"Good start, boring middle, predictable finish",This effort to add yet another conspiracy-based story to the crowded field begins with a grisly murder. It offers some intriguing possibilities dealing with Viet-Nam era military events and then descends into a routine thriller chase and deception story. Very predictable - the apparent explosion victim's body is not found - could it be that he wasn't really killed? You figure it out. Is the obvious suspect really not the killer? yfio. Is the hero's beautiful and charming family going to be threatened if he doesn't cooperate? etc etc etc.
2,its OK,This rack came bent...but when i look it is bent (crooked looking) in the photo so I guess I should have paid more attention. The three bars came separate and just lightly sit on the hooks making it easy to knock off one bar while trying to put jewelery on/off the other bars. It came chipped and dirty looking. I will keep it as it was a low price but I can't recommend it to others.
2,Poor quality,"This works great for about a month, maybe two. I'm on my second one, and there won't be a third. The plastic pieces keep warping or breaking. The rubber fins on the mixer and on the mixer attatchment start wearing down with each use until they no longer engage then totally grind and burn those fins off, rendering both pieces worthless. Spend a little extra money and get a better quality one."
1,No replacement blade in the market.,"If the blades go out of order, you will not be able to find replacement blades.Very low quality blades that will break eventually in a couple of months. Then the whole system is down and no one is going to sell you replacement blades. Please purchase something else with at least some minimum support and parts availability."
1,One time use for me,The first time I used it I was thrilled with it's performance. The second time I tried to use it the coupler wouldn't fit in. Apparantly I didn't keep the cup in the perfect position the first time I used it and it is no longer usable. I would say that it's quality isn't very good if you can't get more than one use out of it.
2,You get what you pay for,"Was great at first. I mainly use the Rocket Blender to make smoothies in the morning and I use the large cup.I made my niece a smoothie one morning using the smaller cups and none of the plastic rings would fit on ANY of the smaller cups. They were all too big. Until that point I had only used one of the large plastic cups and one plastic ring.Today I made another smoothie in the same cup I always use, and the ring kept popping off when I went to drink it. I've only had this for 2 wks and don't even use it daily.It's going to be exchanged for the Magic Bullet."
3,"Love it, but it's burning up","I love this thing, it's my first personal blender. However its motor is burning up after about 3 months of daily use.If you stick to the soft stuff it will last longer. Yes, I overfill the cups, and have started to add a raw carrot to my shake. That's what's killing it.The design, however, is great. I cut up fruit and put it in the included cups, which I cap and store to blend later. Very easy to clean the blade assembly which you don't have to take apart. One downside is the cups are cheap plastic and sometimes it's tough to screw on the caps.By the way, the secret ingredient in Orange Julius - Coffee Mate.I wish they would sell motors to just replace, or sell just the bottom. If I order another set I'll have 6 more cups and lids - I'll have cups all over the place."
1,Wishful thinking,"I keep taking this stuff when I get sick, hoping it will do some good, along with Astragulus, Echinacea, Vitamin C, Oregano, etc. and it still takes me days and days to recover from most illnesses.I suspect most of these supposed cold remedies do absolutely nothing, but I take 'em anyway just in case they might help.For me this is no miracle cure. Good luck with your cold."
5,Dark Tide,"Very well written, interesting history of a little known event and great tie-in to political environment of the era."
4,Interesting and Historical,"Dark Tide encompasses far more than the molasses disaster in 1919, but links the event to other historical, national and world events of the time. Stephen Puleo's research is meticulously documented, for history buffs, and is a wonderful look back in time. In doing so, the reader will see that not much has changed over time. So many things then can easily be transposed on events and attitudes today.Dark Tide starts out a bit difficult to read as the author tries to fit all the various events together in some kind of coherent picture. Considering he does not employ fictional characters to make the story more exciting, I must give him credit for a pretty decent job."
5,easy reading,It was easy reading and very informative. A lot of historical information that helped to complete small details of things that I knew but didn't seem to have enough information for them to make sense. Have recommended to others that also enjoyed.
5,Informative and Interesting Account of a Forgotten Disaster,"Puleo's work does an excellent job of describing the event itself (the Great Boston Molasses Flood) and the ensuring aftermath, while at the same time providing vivid context of the political, economic, and social enviornment at the time (World War I, Prohibition, immigration, the power and influence of labor unions, the growth of ""big business"", etc.) Although he does mention the influenza pandemic taking place during 1918-1919, I would have personally liked to see a little more text devoted to its impact in the Boston area and worldwide. Regardless, the book is extremely well written and enjoyable to read... the kind you don't want to put down once you start reading it. As a professional who works in the areas of emergency preparedness and response, and with a formal background in international affairs and history, this book was perfect for me. Highly recommended!!!"
3,not enough thread,I ran out of 2 colors and called the company. They said they would send more 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting.
5,u2 18 u218 dvd,"JUST EXCELLENT ! AS WITH THE BEATLES , THESE GUYS TAKE ON ALL STYLES OF MUSIC AND ALSO DELVE INTO THE UNCLASSIFIABLE RANGE . IF YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN THE PLUNGE YET ,THIS DVD OFFERS A GREAT START INTO U2 WHO HAVE ALREADY JOINED THE ELITE PANTHEON OF ARTISTS AS THE ROLLING STONES, LED ZEPPELIN ,THE WHO AND THE AFOREMENTIONED BEATLES . BEST PART ABOUT U2? THEY'RE STILL AROUND,STILL TOURING ,STILL MAKING GREAT INNOVATIVE ROCK MUSIC !!"
2,The Irish Curse in DVD format!,"I really thought THIS was what was going to be the bonus DVD for the latest in U2's best of releases that they release as frequently as Bowie these days.I go into this ever so biased in that I gave far too much money to Mr. Hewsom et. al., more than I have in the past twenty years since they sold out.I'm glad there's a lot of the mullet years on this one, but at the same time, this could have been so much more than what it is, especially given the number of videos and what didn't make it:* Nothing from Zooropa, which honestly doesn't bug me.* The live versions of ""I Will Follow"" and ""A Sort of Homecoming"" are M.I.A.* ""Gloria"" and ""Two Hearts"" are also not present nor correct.* The video for ""The Unforgettable Fire""? Not here, laddio.Most of the videos from Rattle and Hum are gone, but again, that's not so bad.Some might disagree, but keep in mind, I'm old. I liked 'em before Live Aid.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
1,Missing CD,"This book might be a great tool for improving English, but only in case you get it with the advertised CD. Unfortunately, it was not my case. So, I got great unusable book."
5,Long Search Completed,"I originally bought this LP, in the Azores, way back in my Navy days. That one was ruined in a flood, in the 70's. Your service is FAST, (arrived today 08/02/012), before delivery date estimate; and the whole package is EXCELLENT. I thank you very much for helping me in this passed 20 year trek, and I hope to continue doing business with you."
2,disappointed,"Very generic. I guess if this is your first time taking a promotional exam it would be helpful. I was expecting much more. If you're looking for a more indepth guide to upper level management promotional opportunities then this is definately not the book for you. Again, not ""dogging"" the authors, it just wasn't what I was looking for."
3,LOL! I am so glad to find other people dislike the original as much as I do!,"I am particularly in agreement with the reviewer who states, ""To me reading them was like trying to absorb road directions from an incoherent person who was hitting you over the head with a board!"" regarding the original Rider Waite. I never really liked the original because of the strange colors and the bizarre expressions the characters all have! Additionally, the horses are really badly drawn, and as a horse-woman, I find that very annoying. The smoother style of the Universal deck resolves these problems pretty well (although I still wonder if the horse in the 6 of wands is a pantomime horse!) This is not my favorite deck, but I do use it about once a week, and I find it pleasant."
5,Way to go!,"This deck is an ideal size -- large enough to read comfortably (not tiny, like other minature decks I've tried to use), yet small enough to take anywhere. Plus, this little beauty comes in its very own attractive, sturdy box -- the cards are well-protected from the vagaries of handbag or pocket travel. No worries here -- the box lid fits well and doesn't fall off (although I must admit I secured mine with a rubber band, just in case!). The weight of the cardstock feels substantial, without being too thick. The edges feel polished, no roughness whatsoever. The cardstock is protected with a smooth matte finish, which shuffles well, and compliments Mary Hanson-Roberts' color beautifully -- a color so lucious, I could eat it with a spoon! The back design is completely reversible and totally beautiful -- it looks like a blue evening sky filled with blue clouds, which have parted to reveal an amazing 8-pointed golden star. I love this deck -- I won't go anywhere without it!"
5,beautiful and fun,"This deck is so nice to use and pleasant to look at, especially if you are used to reading the Rider Waite tarot cards. This is a wonderful addition for any collector and a perfect starter deck for a begginer."
4,Better than the Original,"Mary Hanson-Roberts has taken the line art from the original Rider-Waite deck and inserted her own tone gradations in more attractive watercolors. If you're interested in tarot history, but want something more visually attractive, this is it.Unfortunately, the line art from the orginal remains. If you take a close look at the pen drawings, you may realize that Colamn Smith simply wasn't a very good artist. The figures' faces all seem to be male, and the proportions are terrible.In short, a historically important deck made aesthetically more appealing by Mary Hanson-Roberts' reworking. Get it simply for the reason that all the books refer to the RW tarot. I myself use the New Palladini for actual readings."
3,No Glass Cover/Had Vented Cover,"This is the second corningware oval dish I ordered from amazon..One was the smaller size,they both said they had the vented and the glass cover...both only came with the vented cover.Also for what it's worth: this is made in China it is Corningware by World Kitchen,USA"
2,So-So,"If you've read any of their other books, it's the same stuff over and over again. They should have just written the one book and left it at that."
1,Abort 'em all?,"So, if all babies are swept up into the loving arms of Jesus, shouldn't we abort them all to prevent them a lifetime of suffering?"
4,Great Interview,"This is an interview with Massad Ayoob conducted by Lenny Magill.Topics include; what happens in a gunfight, shot placement, pistol vs. shotgun, 45 vs. 9mm and lots more. He focuses on four ""Keys to Survival"" - Awareness, Tactics, Skill, Equipment.Excellent video that provides some insight into the thoughts of one of the more recognized trainers in the use of firearms for self-defens and law enforcement. As with his books, Ayoob does not just throw out ""do this"", he offers his opinions and gives the reasons behind them.Well worth the time to watch."
4,Not for the beginner,"This is a good book for creative inspiration, but beginners should be aware that it is not intended for floss embroiderers with no ribbon embroidery experience.Some of the directions assume knowledge of basic stitches, and often the directions do not explain how to 'end' a stitch or series of stitches.Do buy this book if you would like to be inspired to begin ribbon embroidery or if have experience and you need new ideas: the pictures are wonderful! And if you already have some knowledge of basic ribbon stitches, you'll be well on your way to new ideas and projects."
1,I'm shocked,I'm really shocked at the reviews this book gets. I'm fascinated and intrigued by astral projections. This book really set me back though. It's random information and stories written in very broken english. The author needs an english editor! It's books like these that delegitimize astral projections because the entire book is goofy stories seemingly written by a child. William Buhlman and Robert Monroe books are far more professional and filled with useful information.
2,I was disappointed....,"This is the first of this author that I have read and I was very disappointed. I found it difficult to get into the book because there is so much superfluous text. There isn't a lot of interaction between the hero and heroinne until about halfway through the book. The plot moved slowly and was hard to stick with. At times, I found myself skimming sections just to get on to the interesting parts. It seems like you are waiting forever to find out what happens and then it all happens right at the end of the book. I did find the historical content to be very good. If I was looking for historical novel as opposed to a historical romance novel, this would be it."
5,Many thanks to the friend who made me read this book.,"I don't usually read medievals but this book may change all that. It was exciting, informative and romantic!"
1,Do Not Buy!!!,Does not work! Do not buy. A waste of money!I contacted Therm-A-Rest about this useless product and they could only recommend that I buy something else to hold two Therm-A-Rests together.
2,Don't waste your money,"This doesn't really work and it is a pain to deal with. I got it as a gift and thought why not use it when I go backpacking with the wife, but it was nothing but annoying."
2,NOT SO GOOD,"i DID NOT FIND THESE COVERS TO BE VERY GOOD. THEY SPLIT IN THE SEAMS. IF YOU JUST WANT TO COVER A CHAIR OR SOFA AND NOT GOING TO SIT ON IT THEY MIGHT BE OKAY. MINE TORE UP BECAUSE I BOUGHT THEM SO THE KIDS COULD SIT AND EAT AND NOT RUIN THE SOFA, DIDN'T WORK."
1,Party lights,Not what I expected. These bulbs are bright pink (for parties) and not soft pink for enhanced room lighting. The company was good about accepting the return but shipping both ways cost me $15 AND I never received the credit for the bulbs. A total waste.
3,Would Of Gave It 3 1/2 If I Could....,"Begining: I love The EE (Enchanting Evening) Barbie. She is so pretty & she looks vintage. (Note: I took her out of the box).Complaints: I lost her shoes (either one or two I can't remember). The flower on her dress also fell off and is now lost. The boa/furry cape is broken & probably lost as well. (I still have her dress & the doll though.)Don't take out of the box unless you want to display it, because you will loose tiny peices & some may break.Face: Makeup, Eyes, Mouth: Her makeup is pretty. Her eyes have big, what I call, eyelashes which are cool & add a vintage look from the blonde versoin of the doll. Her lips are what I call a blood-red shade. I ove her face.Conclusion: This doll's peices (if you take her out of the box to play with) can get lost and/or broken. I recommend this for collectors who will display her in the box, or on the stand & for kids who will not loose the peices, unlike how I did. Thanks for reading. 3 1/2/5 stars."
3,Almost a 2-on-1,"Made in JAP in 1995, Serial# TECX-20922, Playing Time 74:52This CD lifts 16 tracks from Coverdale's first 2 solo albums, 1976's ""White Snake"", and 1978's ""North Winds"". All the tracks from both albums are there in their full length, except for ""Celebration"", which is absent.This ""compilation"" was also released as a 2-on-1 on the Connoisseur label. I suggest you go for the recently remastered individual albums, each of which contains 2 bonus tracks."
3,decent book,"The print is light (hard to read) and there is no bulleting or color blocking to distinquish important information. However, the book does cover all necessary information."
2,WAY Too Salty,"Loved the idea of a healthy snack so gave these a try. Tasty treat but WAY too much salt. They are soooo salty they gave me a headache! If you are watching your sodium intake, skip these little crackers. It's too bad, too, because otherwise they were a nice snack. Not going to purchase again."
3,REALLY Mini Crackers...,"I'd pass on purchasing these snack crackers again. Amazon was out of the full sized Late July Organic Cheddar Cheese Sandwich crackers (which I liked) so I thought I would give these a try. Most were broken and those that weren't were soooo ""mini"". This might be OK for toddlers... They also did not taste as good (cheesy or fresh) as the full size crackers. Sorry Late July... I wouldn't bother making these..."
4,A Must Have Guide Book,"A lot of words are not necessary to tell you that Jan Zobel's Minding Her Own Business is the book for you IF you are thinking of starting your own HOME-BASED business, you are already in business, struggling with what you can and cannot deduct AND you are confused about all the tax information available. This book is geared more to the sole proprietor than to a corporation, LLC or partnership. Ms. Zobel writes in a simplied language that any novice can understand and appreciate. The tax forms section takes the guess work out of what forms to file. It would be extremely helpful if Ms. Zobel published a 4th edition that would include updates for 2004 and 2005 tax filing."
5,Best analysis of the historical truth underlying in the Nativity Story!!!,Any person interested in knowing the real truth about the Nativity Story should buy this item. It is entertaining and very professional at the same time. It's a real scientific analysis of the Nativity story.
4,very informative and a old concept with a new twist,"I heard a lot of this type of diet before (sugar and carbo cutting)but was happy with the way the doctors explained the diet. The common sense, simple way the book was written...I have just got the book and just started the diet today...I enjoyed the book and read it in one day. I reread it over and over to make sure of some points...I have confidence that the diet will work because it explains alot what my body was going through all of these years....Thanks..."
3,Cheer up Clara!,"Clara, it would be helpful to know how to reach you to encourage you. One thing to consider is while this diet may work wonders for your husband and others, it may not be the diet for you. Consider that there are hundreds available, all contending that they are THE WAY to lose weight. The bottom line is this... if you cut calories, and expend more calories than you consume, you'll lose weight. If you are following this plan ""to a T"" and not seeing results, consult the authors or your personal physician. There may be other factors at work.Another thing is consider your physical activity. Perhaps adding an extra 30 minutes of walking will help jumpstart your metabolism. (You took a lot of fuel away when you cut back on sugar.)Third, though not scientific by any means, it's been my experience that men tend to respond to these low-carb diets really well.Continue striving for a healthier lifestyle. Best wishes. You'll get there!"
1,Audio tape review,"If audio tapes are available in addition to the books, I always buy the audio tape and listen to it in my car. This tape drones on and on with mispronounced words and technical jargon. It almost put me to sleep!"
3,Everyone is selling something!,"I think those 5-star reviews were all from youngsters whose metabolisms are in tip-top shape! An honest review from a mid-lifer: This diet plan convinced me that (a) I wasn't eating enough protein (my energy level zoomed on this plan), (b) I was eating too many carbs and refined foods (I had a sharp, 2-wk. headache from eliminating them and discovered that they cause fatigue when I added them back 6 wks. later) and (c) if you want to lose weight, exercise regularly and get the fats and carbs out of your diet. Simple, isn't it?"
3,"Good, but there is better...","I enjoyed the dvd to some degree, but to get the most updated info on what went on, I recommend documentaries that were made after the fall of the Soviet Union - post 1990. You get never before released files from the BBC Laurence Rees series ""Stalin: Behind Closed Doors"" and ""War of the Century - Hitler and Stalin"". As an American, I find the BBC is more inclined to give you a more objective look at what really happened and with less propaganda than some American influenced productions. The ""World at War"" (a British production)series is very good, but was made in 1972 and doesn't have the post 1990 Russian info that wasn't available prior to the current ""open door"" Soviet policy. Many of the Stalin atrocities were never admitted to previously."
1,Failed after 4 days,"Like many others have noted, the rubber gasket/seal disconnected after 4 days of use, even though I was careful to support it while putting it on or off."
2,I recently broke my ankle and had to cast my lower right leg...,...all you need to do in order to protect the cast and keep it dry while you take a shower is to use a $3.98 roll of Saran-Wrap or Glad-Wrap. Doing what I did was inexpensive and easily removable. The Item is too expensive for my use. An easy way to figure out if this item is for you is by answering the this next question: Would you use a condom a second time?
1,Seems like it would be good...,"except it tore putting it on the first time. I followed all the directions: put on stocking over the cast, only pull the blue ring. It still tore.I'd recommend just duct taping a trash bag.My first disappoint buy using Amazon Prime."
2,updated review after 2nd use,UPDATE REVIEW: the ring pulled away from for material on 2nd use! Naturally I expected to use more that 1 time. Going to contact company for refund. Very disappointed with this product.
1,"Good concept, poor execution.","I purchased this for my wife, who recently ended up in a cast. While this product looks like an ideal solution to the alternative of a kitchen trash bag and medical tape, it's not. It's just too darn difficult to get on and off. The rubber piece at the top that keeps it 'waterproof' is just way to hard to pull up over your foot, let alone up your leg. Taking it off is not pleasure either."
1,Shower cast protector,"This item took a week longer to arrive than the crutch supports I ordered. When I first tried to pull time item over the cast on my right leg it became an impossible task even with help. if the item had worked it would have been worth it. I have been using a med. size trash bag and taping it with 2"" wide medical tape which works great. This product is a waste of you time and money."
1,Works for a minute,This is an awesome idea but after the 5th use it broke and could not be repaired. Had to revert back to the trashbag.
1,Duro-med cast protector,I would not recommend this item. The top piece that is a stretchy rubber piece that stretches over your cast goes on fine but once you take it off it ripped. So I was able to use it only one time. I'll stick to a garbage bag. It was cheaper too.
3,disappointed,"This is the second time I have purchased this product to aid me in a second time for foot surgery. The first time I purchased this item it lasted the whole 12 weeks I was in a cast, but this time it didn't even last 1 week! The rubber band that keeps the water-tight seal broke while putting it over my cast. So I decided not to order it again since I would have to wait for it to be shipped."
1,No good for me,"I got this just after ankle surgery so I could shower with my cast on. The vinyl is strong and good quality, however the opening is way too small to fit my foot/ankle/cast through without a lot of pain and pressure on my injury, so I had to make a small cut to fit my foot through it. Once doing that it fit great, but it ripped from where I cut it, and I had to duct tape this around my leg to keep it on. VERY disappointed in this product and the money I wasted on it. Also the large blue ring around the top made it very difficult to move around the shower stool I have. There was also plenty of inside condensation after my shower. Would not recommend this at all."
3,"I like the brand but the iten realy didnt cover my expectation.In one week it doent work nobody recomend me this product, I so t","I like the brand but the iten realy didnt cover my expectation.In one week it doent work nobody recomend me this product, I so t"
5,Historical Epic,The Winds of War is an excellent historical account of events leading up to America's entry into World War II. It follows the lives of the fictional Henry family as they are intertwined into actual events.
5,pjpp.....Great Mini Series!!,"This Mini Series ""The Winds of War"" was the first of two Mini series about World War 11. It consists of 5 videos and we watched it on vacation the year we got it. It was filmed in Annapolis, Maryland with many stars besides Mitch. A very accurate and dynamatic story, yet not excluding the human side. Great acting and writing. One that should not be missed in our history................PJ Peake"
2,Re: LUnch,"sure, lunch sounds great. How about Cluster's (on Clarize, like two doors down from the flower shop)? Just to get the air totally clear, I don't want you to get any funny ideas in your head about that if I agree to lunch than there's any chance of us getting back together. Remember: it was your who ""needed some 'me time'"" about three weeks ago. I dont' know what's happened since then, i don't want to know, i'm seeing a really great guy (who, in contrast to certain-people-who-shall-remain-nameless, treates me like a lady), and you ahve to deal with your own problems. i've already cried my eyes out over you.How's 1:30? -Linda"
4,Surf Music Reboot,"A well recorded collection of both old standards and new compositions (about half and half) by this talented group. I like their arrangements on the new stuff as well as the cover versions. It is nice to get out of the rut of listening to the same versions of the same songs all the time. Ska beat on ""Exodus"" was unexpected but good."
5,"Wall Mounted Flat Screen 1"" Closer to Wall.","This right angle adapter with 360 degree swivel allowed me to push my LG 55"" to within one inch of the wall. I lost no reception and now for a couple of bucks reduced the profile of my TV."
5,Great adapters,"Ordered this 90 degree adapter to get my LED on to a low profile wall mount, they are exactly what I was looking for. After these are on your cables you should only need about half an inch to an inch clearance for the cable, and an inch to allow you to plug in and unplug. Great for getting low profile."
1,Another quick-fix book,"Don't waste your time/money on this book! The program is almost impossible to follow for sane human beings, unhealthy, and panders to the quick-fix mentality Americans are suckers for. After all, who would buy a book entitled, the slow & healthy way to a flat stomach? The only people who would recommend this book are those affilated with Darden, or those ignorant of ANY knowledge of fitness or nutrition. If you want real information on nutrition look for someone who is a registered dietitian. Here's my suggestion: Try searching for books by someone like Nancy Clark."
1,Junk science,"After all these years, Darden still preaches slow motion resistance training, a system proven to demonstrate mediocre results."
2,disappointing....,"Was expecting beautiful scenery shots- fly overs, etc - instead was more scientific (which isn't bad - love nature shows) but found the subject matter lacking in depth."
2,"interesting, but dated","This work covered the case of three women on death row. At first, I thought the work was going to be one-sided, but I think it later tries to allow viewers to come to their own conclusions. Bill Kurtis repeats that far fewer women who kill get put on death row. Then of those on death row, many of them get their sentences communted. He asks, but never answers, why are states so less likely to kill women.Here's the thing, the work never mentions Aileen Wuournos, so I think this was produced before her crimes in the early 90s or late 80s. The work covers imprisoned women who go on to say they've become evangelicals and they could preach against violence if they were allowed to live. I recall an old law professor telling me that line doesn't get women off death row nowadays.In short, great facts, but they're from 20 years ago!"
2,All to brief dvd,"This was a little disappointing. Professor Erickson certainly knows his stuff but at only 45 minutes, poor graphic maps and repeated footage it all left me wanting more. I'd rather read his books personally. Why is it that film makers out there just can't seem to get these type of DVDs right??"
4,Maximum Overdrive - 2 Unlimited,"German CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE"" - 2 UNLIMITED1) Radio Edit - 3:242) Extended - 5:153) Speedaumatic Remix - 5:404) X-Out In-Trance - 4:511993"
2,Clips,Clips were too large for my cover and weird to configure to the tank. Instructions were not helpful. Once we figured it out they are not very secure. May have to buy another cover for the tank
4,Mindbend,"This is a very good book, and I would recommend you read it because it has a lot of surprising twists to it, and is an overall interesting story. The main character, Adam Schonberg, and his wife, Jennifer, just found out they are going to have a baby. This book is narrated in the third person, which I think works really well with this story. I am personally having trouble relating to Adam, but hopefully a lot of you can. I haven't read any of Robert Cook's books before, but I really enjoyed this one."
3,Decent,Mindbend was a decent book to say the least. I found intriging until the last 100 pgs. I figured out what was going on. If you are reading it or plan ready it for bed time or a road trip.
1,"Little to do with counseling, much to do with authors bias.","Mr. Axelson seems bent on promoting his prejudice toward the ""dominent society values"", disregarding such concepts as ""melting pot"", ""Americanization"", etc. Seems to have little insight into Mexican-American culture and virtually a first grade level comprehension of Asian values. Abhors the use of stereotypes yet uses ""honky"" and other terms to describe white America. As a tool for helping those in the helping profession, it is of little use. The theme of counseling is merely a front for Mr. Axelson's personal agenda."
2,Cleaning set review.,Very cute item but the broomstick and mopstick are too short.Diappointed in this aspect.Willhave to buy another set from somewhere else due to item being too short.
4,lil cleaners,"This was my nephews best gift ever!! He absolutely loves it, swept up all the wrapping paper and then on to the imaginary dirt. He loves putting the mop in the bucket and then in the strain part and he doesn't know that there should be water in it yet. The only thing that kept this from a five star rating it's for 24m+ and the handles are shorter than I thought they should be and the bucket a little narrow, otherwise would recommend to any Lil cleaner"
4,Move the furniture for this one!,"This is probably my favorite cardio tape. It's fast moving and fun. Anyone who can count to three and watches more than once can keep up with this. My biggest problem is that I'm clumsy! So not only am I getting a great workout, it's also a chance to cut loose and laugh at myself a little bit. Unless you are looking for a bootcamp, no fun, boring repetition, drone instructor, robotic perfection, then this is a great, fun, let your hair down workout. I would definitely recommend. The toning segment at the end is good for the lower body and you can even add in some light upper body toning by adding weights during the standing leg work."
4,Great!!!,Got these straps so that I could Molle my sleeping bag to my Condor 3 day assault pack. They work great! I have not used them in the field yet but they secured the sleeping bag tightly and there is no slipping of the straps. They got 4 stars because I wish they were just a tad wider but that's just nitpicking.
3,"Unsatisfied with song content, some of my favorite classics were missing","Condition of book is acceptable, one of plastic binder cracked but not an issue. Very upset that this book with over 1200 songs, does not include some of the all time classics like ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", ""Wonderful World"", ""Wonderful Tonight"", .. for example, these are true classics. I will keep book since it does have a few songs here and there that I didn't expect to find."
3,Don't Believe the Backlash,"Maybe I'm just a counter-contrarian, but Palladio isn't half as bad as many of the reviews posted would suggest. (Neither is it as good as much of the hype to which people are reacting suggested.) Rather, it's a perfectly decent, fast-moving, entertaining story about reasonably rounded characters working in the fairly interesting world of modern-day advertising. Does Palladio achieve the author's transparent ambitions for it? Not by a long shot. Will it change your life? No. On the other hand, it's a decent book and might -- might -- get you to think about some pretty obvious media-related issues that are at least worth considering."
4,Nice Stands,"As a Saint Seiya fan, I have purchased some Myth Cloth through this year so I wanted to show them off in my bedroom, reason why I purchased these stands.They are good quality and hold the figures in place. I think its purpose is accomplished."
5,Great reading,This is a book that we get annually. It makes great readinganywhere and at any time. We especially like to keep it in our private area as we can get little bits of information in ashort time.I reccommend it to anyone who likes facts thatchange annually.
5,Great album,"Stumbled on this album by accident when searching for music. I played the first, second, third songs and I was hooked."
5,beautiful suet feeder,I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived to discover that it was metal and not plastic (since this is not disclosed in the item description). And it is much more attractive than a boring suet cage. A perfect addition for bird watching!
3,Rio,"Fast service,but video rec'd. was Russian import with cyrillic writing. Had explanation jow to load & play. not what I expected."
2,Problems abound!,"I also bought this system primarily for the Bose name and quality, it did sound much better and deeper in the store, it was easy to hook up and at first was impressed by the ease of use and sound, but then I started experiencing problems with the unit freezing during movies. the only way to get it to play again is to unplug the unit from the wall and ""reboot"" and then spend 10 minutes trying to get back to the place you left off. After reading some other reviews about the 321 system, I see that this is a common problem. It will freeze on some movies and not at all on others, it makes no sense whatsoever. I also own movies in my DVD collection that it refuses to play at all, but will play fine on my 8 year old Pioneer DVD system. I am not satisfied with this system at all and consider it way over priced for performance and craftsmanship. I will replace this unit next year, but it will not be a Bose. Stick with the speakers from Bose, not the electronics. Lesson learned!"
1,"~~~~ TRUST ME, DO NOT BUY ~~~~~~","FIgured it was the best one out there since it was BOSE. Well now it won't play ANY DVD'S because it says the FORMAT IS UNSUPPORTED. Had no idea why it would say such a thing. Looked online, and saw that a million other people had the same problem.Now I watch DVDs through my <$100 DVD player that never fails.Something wrong with this picture?"
5,This Book Will Touch Your Soul,"C.S. Lewis is one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. Not only gifted in the writing of fiction (as in ""The Chronicles of Narnia""), Mr. Lewis is also admired as a Christian writer. This book, a compilation of excerpts from such books as ""The Screwtape Letters"", ""Mere Christianity"", and ""The Problem of Pain"", is an incredible lesson in wisdom, patience and forebearance. Anyone who reads this book will be blessed by the candid honesty of Mr. Lewis and his experiences."
3,Good product but........,"It's a great tool and I received it promptly, but the shipping and handling will bite you."
1,"great music, poor manufacturing",These recordings are wonderful and deserve five star reviews. I am giving only one star because of this compilation's apparently poor manufacturing. I bought a copy from Amazon and returned it because the right channel in track 17 was obviously distorted. I exchanged it for another copy but it had the same problem. For that to happen there must have been a run of defective CDs.
5,Great Harness!,"I bought the small harness for my 15 lbs dog. It fits her perfectly. If she was any bigger, I would have gotten the medium. The harness is very secure and straps to the seatbelt easily. The harness still has enough slack for her to lay down and sit up. I also like how it restrains her at the chest and not the neck."
1,Won't help in an accident...,"If you're looking for a car harness that will keep your dog safe in an accident, keep looking...This harness might work to prevent your dog from bouncing around the car and possibly distracting the driver (although I'm not even confident it would hold up for that use with a big, strong dog) but I seriously doubt it would hold up even in a mild collision.The dog is held in place using a few plastic buckles/snaps which are not even very strong-looking-- I have seen stronger snaps on regular dog collars. Plastic snaps like these would not hold up to the forces created in a collision.If you want a safety harness that will protect your dog in an accident, look for one that has actually been tested/rated similar to human car safety devices."
5,Excelente material,"Contiene testimonios impactantes. Milagros divinos que hace Dios en la vida de las personas. Son testimonios que impactan la vida del vidente,para Dios no hay nada dicifil...si eres Cristiano puedes usarlo para evangelisar a tus amigos...si aun no eres espero que Dios toque tu vida con estos testimonios. DTB"
4,Excellent Tucanazo material,"As Usual, Los Tucanes de Tijuana put out more of what we nortenos want. Unlike that Tex-Mex stuff, these corridos keep you interested with excellent ballads that have actual meaning. If you like Los Tucanes de Tijuana be sure to add this one to your collection!"
5,Great Toy or Collector's Item!,"Not only is Mace Windu's Attack Battalion a great toy to build your clone army, but it is also a great exclusive battle pack to add to any Star Wars collection. Although these troops don't show up much in the Expanded Universe of Star Wars, they are still a good strike force for any collection. Even though I'm just a young teen, I have over 300 Star Wars figures in 8 different sizes, and these are by far my favorite 4 inch figures out of my 200+ 4 inch figure army."
2,No positive results.,"I really hoped this one would work.However, I noticed no positive results.It would be so great if I could find something that really does give energy to Fibro patients."
1,It's a Bust,Jonathan is adorably feckless in Europe but annoyingly clueless in California. Pears' books are fun to read but this one barely makes it as beach material. Sorry.
1,Nothing to do with paintball or with tactics!,"It's amazing how the basic safety rules are ignored (everyone walking around *and* shooting paintball markers without anyone wearing masks or even goggles!), how everything that you shouldn't do (like running for more than a few seconds in a straight line towards people shooting full auto markers) is depicted as the right approach and how the makers even manage to talk about airsoft, BB and pellet guns!Oh, and the ""infomercial"" by RAP4 also helped take away any of the remaining credibility or value to this video.In short: don't buy it and especially don't give it to someone looking to get into paintball! They will get the wrong impression!"
1,It's a lemon-DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"The Shoe doesn't work correctly. There is a grooved notch in the part that slides and a round rubber gizmo seated in it on one side. There is another round rubber gizmo on the other side, but no notched area in the metal to hold it in place. I've looked at REAL SHOES at a real casino and this product is defective. The sliding portion doesn't move at all due to the manufacturing defect. It was a waste of money and I'll order a different one from somewhere else. It's a shame because the lexan parts all seem to be well crafted."
2,What Happened ??,This item is poor quality and has a cheap feel. Other items (same brand) made to go with this seemed like they were made much better. Which leaves me wondering....What happened ???
1,"Cheap quality, to the point of insulting.","This was my first Amazon purchase of a Blackjack dealing shoe, and boy was I rudely welcomed!It came in a raggedy box and the shoe itself was scratched and covered in factory debris. The black slider was broken so the metal bearing would fall out very easily. It appears someone applied super glue on the ridges to try and rectify the situation, and it failed miserably.What kind of company would have the audacity to send me such a piece of crap product?This is nowhere near Casino quality in terms of design and performance. So let's say it wasn't broken and gnarled up. It's still cheap looking. The picture makes it look really good though. Because it AT LEAST comes with the parts you see, it gets 1-star instead of ZERO."
1,the crappiuest live band ive ever seen on dvd,"Vince neil dosent even complete his own lyrics, he only sings half and stops, and no TOMMY LEE. this dvd sucks! im glad i never saw them live i would want a refund!!"
2,It's just a concert,"I thought that it would be more of an interview with the band. It only had a short interview with Mick, Randy, Nikki and Vince and since Randy had to leave the band due to illness they didn't even interview the new drummer from Hole and she played the concert. It just seemed a little cheesey for Motley Crue! Hope the books better."
3,motley?....well not anymore!,"Man I was so looking forward to seeing this dvd, when I finally pressed play I was in total shock!...really, firstly there are only two of the original crue line-up here!...mick mars & nikki sixx are ever so present at this concert but Mr vince neil is left back in the day! his vocals are shocking, he continously troughout the show misses like maybe 20 words per song...he cant even hold a not, the only song that sounded up to stratch was home sweet home, and thats only because he sang that song standing in the same spot and never lost his breath!the second fault here is obviously the absense of tommy lee, which is inevitable that you wont witness anything spectacular at this half packed concert. So If you are a die hard crue fan then get this dvd, If not dont be bothered. save your cash"
3,Post Kiss Effort,This album is good but not great. I think it is a better overall album than his first solo album mainly because I don't get bored with all the ballads.
2,1978 solo effort has more strong tunes on it,"If you really like Peter Criss' singing voice, and you're not too hard on his writing chops (which are not terribly strong), I think you will STILL find his original solo collection from 1978 a better album. On ""Out of Control"" a lot of the material suffers from sort-of cheesy lyrics (though heartfelt, sometimes a bit weak, unintentionally comic), and, as someone else noted, some misfires when Criss attempts to rock harder than he should be doing with this outfit. My favorite track is ""Words"" which, for me as a KISS fan and Criss admirer, makes this CD worth owning. But probably not for $24.00.But, if you're curious, and you gotta have it, then you gotta have it."
5,water melon man,love this move watch it years ago with my gandmother.didn't realy under stand it back then but.i do now and were im from there r alot ofpeople around her just like himand they are a jock want b's.and it crack me up. im a realblack man and love who i am.and there is alot of black duds around.here that went to bed (W)and got up black.and it's so funny to watch them cuz im.so above them.thanks. keeping it real
3,Watermelon Man,Fairly decent movie-a humorous satire. Godfrey Cambridge did a good job in the movie but not as good as he does in Cotton Comes to Harlem. Pretty good for its time. Estelle Parsons was also very good in the movie.
1,Waste of time,This film did not live up to my expectations The acting was way over the top which was a shame because the script was good .He was not convincing you could not see the difference in the two roles.
2,Kind of Boring!,I thought this book was about an interracial relationship but it was not. It took me a long time to get into this book. It was kind of boring but I finished it. I am not into the S&M and both of the stories were about S&M. I would suggest borrowing the book or getting it from the library. I don't think I will be buying anything else from this author.
2,Do not buy unless you have no restraint (like me),"Great live video footage, BUT interupted every 30 secs with random movies of Santana and Mexicans roaming the streets of Mexico city. Very irritating to watch as he launches into some of his greatest solos to be suddenly confronted with a movie of people walking past a fountain.....duh? Frontal Lobotomy needed for the whiz kids who came up with this one."
3,They leak!,I have purchased these in years prior and LOVE them! I prefer to keep them in my diaper bag or purse since they are easier than a sippy cup. With the last ones I purchased they don't seem to fit the bottles correct. Either the threading changed on the caps or the manufacturer's changed the threading so they don't screw on right. Disappointing because they were really handy. I noticed it on the Minute Maid bottles and Aquafina water bottles--will try them on other brands before giving up hope!
1,"poor quality, poor service","Had the TV for 6 months until the plasma display panel began to fail - numerous green and red dots throughout the picture. We went through the Samsung warranty and were told by the repair shop, after 4 weeks of waiting, that the TV was beyond repair. Samsung contacted us a week later and told us that they would replace the TV, but that we would have to pay for the shipping. Very unhappy with this purchase. Would not buy Samsung again."
5,FANTASTIC,"Product arrived as ordered, packaged professionally, no damage!T.V was an exceptional value, have not been able to find this same TV on the street for less than $1400 and I paid less than $1100..Great Deal, very very very very HAPPY!"
1,HORRIBLE picture,"We regret buying this tv because it is sooooo grainy!!! We have had items burn into the screen already and have only owned it for 1 month. Do not waste your money on this tv, I wish I did not."
1,Don't waste your money for this system,"Bought this system back in December 2005. Two weeks later the center unit started skipping on any DVDs or CDs. Sometimes it just turned itself off while trying to read a DVD. I brought it back to a retail store for exchanging. This ""exact"" same problem did happen to the replacement too. The system is now at one of the Bose repair centers. I hope they could get it all straight out this time :("
2,Beware serious limitations,"This system is clean, easy to install and nice looking, but there are serious limitations to its design. For starters, there's no headphone jack. Bose seems to think that you would never want to listen to your CDs or DVDs on anything other than their speakers, because there's no other way to get any sound out of this unit. There's no analog audio output, either, so forget dubbing CDs or DVD to any other analog source. I can understand the desire for simplicity in the design, but at this price point these limitations are simply unacceptable.In short, this system is overpriced for the performance you get. There are much more capable systems out there for a lot less money, with better sound quality. Bose is known for using cheap, paper-coned speakers in their systems. They can't call their ""Acoustimass"" unit a subwoofer because it's not capable of producing true subwoofer frequencies. Buyer beware!"
3,a general observation,"I have not read the book, nor do I intend to read it. I'd just like to comment on this brilliant turn of phrase from the author's note:""there are lots of books around with pretty pictures, you might enjoy one with a cloth cover, or that in which you can color in.""I love when people try to sound witty and intelligent and fail miserably."
2,It's all downhill from here...,"This dvd player was great in the beginning. After about 1 month of use, it's starting to freeze up during movies. Next time I'm going to spend the extra money and get one thats worth keeping. I guess you get what you pay for right?"
1,all coby products,I do not own this coby product but have purchased coby in the past. I bought a coby tv dvd combo and a coby dvd recorder. Both items didnt last a year. The recorder didnt last a month. Coby is a generic brand that was put out to make money by selling cheaper than the name brands. There products are pretty much disposable. Use them for a little bit and have to throw them out. I will never again purchase anything from this company. You really do get what you pay for with electronics. Beware!!!
1,Buyer Beware,"I have bought three of these dvd players under the impression that they were a great buy. Since that I have come to find out that I was dead wrong. All three are no longer working. The warranty is still in effect, but Coby wants you to pay $25.00 for shipping and handling to replace it. Thats what I paid for the dvd player. Keep this in mind before you purchase one of these."
1,Only plays a handful of DVDs,"This player is really hit or miss. Some DVDs play perfectly fine, while others randomly skip or don't play at all."
2,Plays many DVDs but that is the best feature,"The unit plays just about any dvd you put in there along with mp3s and cd-r media.One of my big problems with this is that the search and skip buttons are the same (Hold it down to search and just press it to skip). Problem is, sometimes you want to search and it just skips to the next song or scene. It gets to be a pain after a while.This unit also gets very hot when it is plugged in. It doesnt matter if you are using it or not. Recently, this player has started giving me the message that the door is open or that there is something wrong with the disc. This can usually be corrected by turning the unit off and on again but it still is annoying.You get what u pay for."
2,does not keep its promises,"it works fine but it does not play dvds that were bought in europe and have the regional code 2 on them. the descrption is VERY missleading, it says it plays pal and ntsc formats. so don't by it for that reason. it does not work!!"
4,nice,"My 10 year old sister loves it! It's compact, cheap, and it plays ok. I think its perfect for kids/teens though I wouldn't recommend it if you'll use it for your home theater or something."
4,Nice features - cheap material,"This dvd would be just perfect if it had a better shell. It is built from those cheap Chinese plastic material, that breaks easily. But the features are great. For the price, it's a excellent choice!"
1,"Good on paper, but breaks easily","I bought this unit as a gift for my father because it is relatively simple to change its region code.Unfortunately, even though it is very small and is packed with nice features such as Dolby Digital sound, it did not last six months.Considering you can get a Philips or other name brand DVD player for little more, I think this is very expensive for what is delivers."
5,Coby DVD-207 Compact DVD Player,The product is very good and so easy to cary around. I bought it to play PAL formated DVDs but I still can't play them. It may be me or the tapes because this is supposed to be a code free player. One way or the other I like it.
5,Toslink mini plug,"Good quality, and it worked. I bought this for use in my Macbook pro so I could do an optical out when it was connected to the TV/home theater. The adapter plugged right in and worked exactly as intended. Also it was inexpensive and came fast as I have come to expect from Prime shipping."
5,A Million Dollar Movie for sure--Why isn't on the NYTimes,This book is so well written and would be such a greatcommercial success if it were made into a movie. Thiswriter expresses what is going on in our society and howit feels to be a single mother and what one encounters andshe expresses it like poetry........fantastic.....beautifully.THIS SHOULD BE MADE INTO A MOVIE.
1,I HAVE TO COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU,"The 2-star negative review on here is completely and exactly my experience of this CD and how I feel about it: ""God is this boring. I really really liked OTC and based on the reviews here, decided to buy this. Big mistake. this is really not interesting in the slightest. What made OTC so fantastic were the constant changes, the manic transitions between dreaminess, noise, quiet, and pure pop. This is non of that. I found it uninspired pap. If you are new to this, go check out OTC or Neutral Milk Hotel. Better yet, go listen to the Flaming Lips.""--a music fan from New York."
5,DOCTOR WHO THE FIVE DOCTORS WAS GOOD MARK,Doctor who the five doctors was good and it had all the five doctorsand a dalek and lots of cybermen.age9MarkThomann
1,Use carefully - I had a bad burning reaction to this cream,"I strongly recommend you use this once and then wait a few days to see how your skin copes with it, it's very strong. My dermatologist recommended this to treat dark under-eye circles and for the first few days I used it, the colour and texture of my skin did seem to be improving, then the skin itching and going red, and I had a strong burning sensation. I couldn't go out for a week it got so red and sore, even though I stopped using the product. I told my doctor, who said reactions like this were unheard of - I must have been using too much, he said. A few months later I tried again, a single application of a TINY bit. My eyes looked better within hours but two days later (with no further usage) they were burning again, so I won't be using it any more. I may well be an unusual case but I recommend you use it with caution."
2,Not the best in its class,"I bought the book because I thought the ""Easy and Affordable Techniques"" would be clever and insightful, which they were not. The author's ultimate advice is to buy the standard lighting equipment, but slowly. While he does explain how/why the standard studio lighting equipment works, so does virtually every lighting book. I prefer the Pro Lighting Series for better photos, better diagrams, and better writing."
5,Great Product,"This brings back so many great memories of the DEC line of computers! At this price, it is a steal! But it now and re-live the the golden aged of DEC computers!"
4,Blessing from Above....literally,"A Blessing from Above...literally...when a baby bird falls out of the nest and into the empty pouch of a kangaroo. Cute little story with adorable illustrations. I wonder how a child may respond to how the mama blue bird keeps a nestful of babies but is okay with her ""littlest one"" being adopted by a kangaroo since she knows ""her nest was not big enough for all her chicks."" But, maybe I'm just overthinking things (I have a tendency to do that, you know).If you want to read more reviews of adoption themed kids books, visit the 2/22/12 post on my blog www(dot)myoverthinking(dot)com"
1,Worthless,"I'm a 47 year old male, 6 feet, 195 lbs. I work in a stress related field. I excercise and diet moderately. I have about 10-15 lbs of belly and waist fat that I have not been able to get rid of. Based on the very convincing advertising of Relacor, I bought two bottles at $25 each. They advertise that you should begin to see some results within just a few days and significant results within 3-4 weeks. After five weeks of taking this product as recommended, I have seen ZERO results. I feel like I purchased $50 worth of placibo. This product has been a complete waste of my money, time and hope. I don't know if other similar products would be more effective; but I'm pretty hesitant to try. (Once bitten, twice shy). My rec: don't waste your money!"
1,Find Something Else,"Tried this product for a month. It does reduce appetite, but no better than other, cheaper, products. The ""stress reducing"" aspects...I never saw them. ""Mood improvement"" aspects...never saw these either. Shop around, find something a little more reliable."
3,"Not so good on the loss of belly fat, but awesome on pre-menopausal symptoms","While it's not that great on the belly fat, it is AWESOME on pre-menopausal symptoms. I don't break out anymore, I don't have the mood swings. This works better for me than progestrone cream. No hot flashes. Even temperment. I don't take it as prescribed for the belly fat loss, but I must say I do love this product."
5,good book for guitarists,This is a good intro to guitar playing. Tells you how to pick and introduces playing a step at a time.
5,I Give it 5 STARS,"I loved The King's Equal because of its magical moments. For instance, when Rosamund said that there was no more grain to make bread with, the wolf said there was and there was enough to last them the whole year. I think that Rosamund thought that Raphael was a big fool because he wouldn't let anybody go to school and he made everyone sell their stuff to him and buy it back. Raphael also sent his councilors out to find a princess and threatened to send them to the dungeon if they didn't find one. I recommend reading this book because it has a lot of excitement and describing words."
5,Outstanding,These Monster StudioLink RCA cables are simply outstanding and retail for much less than the consumer oriented Monster products. They out perform any of the high end Monster RCA cables that I use for connecting stereo/home theater components.I purchased these cable to upgrade the stock RCA cables on my Thorens TD 280 turntable. Wow what a huge sonic improvement. I wish I had done this 20 years ago. The range of sound transmitted is greatly expanded. You can hear notes and lyrics on the vinyl that simply were being clipped with the limited stock RCA cables. Listening to my old albums is an entirely new and improved experience!!!
5,How to Write Poetry,"I picked this book up from the library on a lark and started to read it through. I found the approach in the first few chapters very matter of fact and direct without getting involved with a lot of technicalities of writing. The process recommended observation and note taking as a fundamental, which made a lot of sense to me. I looked for the book on Amazon and purchased it. I am looking forward to using this book as a practical manual not just for poetry but for all writing."
2,did'nt fit,does not work with my shaver made the wrong choice it told me it would but didn't the holes don't fit in the lots
4,Trans-dimensional Poem,"Maybe people are expecting a straight horror film; this is not one. It is a blend of horror, sci-fi, spiritual, religious and a dream/nightmare of the past/future, re-told or re-experienced by someone who is already in that other dimension. We come to understand it through the cumulative time/image shifts between that dimension and our own. It is initially difficult to grasp, and it never becomes an entertainment. Hurrah that inexperienced film makers with low budgets have vision and tenacity. Maybe they are the only people left who can actually make what they want to, and deliver an original, poetic and elusive - however low budget - experience of wondering and provocation."
4,Classic Ski Movies,"Blizzard of Ahs, and to a similar extent, License to Thrill, are simply the best ski movies ever.Just two major criticisms of this set:1. It's not 16:9 or letterbox. Stump, are you sure you couldn't figure out a way to letterbox this? Didn't you shoot it on film?2. The audio sucks, and that's one of the best things about these movies.Please remix the sound and do this in an HD format, Stump."
1,Arrogance on Parade,"I bought this for our ski vacation thinking it would be fun in the background during apre ski. But....these videos are so dated and obnoxious.....we didn't it even bring them with us. At one point on the video they have a woman join their ""team"", she was a famous woman racer (US olympic ski team), who confesses on camera that she tried to ""keep up with the boys, but has now learned her lesson""! OMG, don't buy these videos!!!!"
1,still disappointed,"it's been over a month since my order and I still haven't received it, although when I placed the order the website said it was ""in stock"" and would ship within the next 2 days."
3,Good but...,"This is a very interesting book. The reader gets a look at Hitler that is different from the usual. A more personal side to Hitler is exposed in this historical-fiction tale. However, early in the novel, it is hard to tell whether this is a fictious book or historical. For the first half the chapters are clearly divided between Hitler's actions and Geli's actions in their own lives. They do not really intermingle till the second half of the novel. The second half, in my opinion, is the most important part of this book. The first half is little more than a recap of Hitler's early military and political travails."
3,Well Written and Researched Historical Novel w/ Weak Ending,"Hansen's writing and craft cannot be denied. He is an extremely talented writer and this novel is another testament to his skills. He has the ability to convey so much detail and emotion in a few words. Many of the chapters end with great tension and conflict, but the ending is less powerful. Maybe I thought this way because the book jacket gives it away. Nevertheless, the development of Gaily and her relationship to her famous uncle is outstanding, but it would have been nice to see Hitler's opinion of his niece. The way the plot develops makes the reader think that Hilter is an insane freak (not to say that he isn't, but some vacillation of opinion could have added volumes and possibly added strength to the ending). Ultimately, this novel is a good read, but not Hansen's best. If you are looking for a great introduction to his work, you should read ""Atticus"" instead."
1,My three year old boy writes better!,"maybe i'm too harsh but really, this is not a proper book, it is all too obvious, there is no imagination. If want to write a fictious novel you must write an interesting, an appealing story. this I am afraid is not an interesting nor appealing story."
5,Darn cute,"Sweetest round toe, low on the sides...very sexy. Order maybe a half size up-- seems that way w/ all J.S. shoes. I got both brown and black suede. Darling, truly."
3,"Cute shoes, but narrow","Cute shoes, but a little narrow and my toes were definitely crammed. Wish these shoes were a tad wider and had a bit more cushion."
3,Nice intimate music,"Great sound - super clear and detailed. Gets a medium score overall because of generally lackluster songs. However, two that I believe are sung and probably written by Karla Bonoff (Under the Rainbow and On The Wind) are absolute knockouts. Very natural melodies and sincere sublime lyrics - trademarks of Bonoff compositions. Her delivery is perfect as always. Even just on vocal quality, I rank her above Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and others who achieved greater fame. In my book, only female country-ish singer-songwriter who is on same level is Dolly Parton."
5,over 20 years...,"I saw this when i was a kid and all i could remember was the hook of the song and the look of it. They played it back in the day when disney was a real channel and would have a whole holiday section for each month. this is fantastic. i mean think about it....i went around for over 20 years asking and typing ""witch magic"" just to find it again lol"
1,Not worth your time or money!,I am writing to warn others about the total predictibility and cheesiness of this book. I read it for a book club and was totally disappointed. I hardly got to know the characters and I never really cared about what happened to them. I refuse to read any more of this author's books - I wish I could get a refund for the time and money I wasted on this one!
2,Cliched cliches,"In ""A perfect day,"" Robert Mason Harlan, an unemployed radio ad salesman, writes a book, with the title, ""A perfect day."" Yes, the book written by the protagonist has the same name as the book written by Richard Paul Evans. Both authors even have three names, same as a serial killer, the ficticious author notes. On his first media tour interview, Harlan is confonted by a morning talk show host with a review, by the real newspaper, The Baltimore Sun, that describes Harlan's book book as ""trite, poorly written and an unabashed yank of emotional strings."" So, in this case, Evans has written two accurate reviews for two books. There is little reason to pile on.The only good news was that this was my first experience with a large type book, which made it easier to read this vapid story. I wasted a short time with this book. Save yours for something worth reading."
3,Bland & Boring - thank God I didn't buy it!,"I was stuck in a hotel with a book I couldn't read, and the hotel chain had this great idea - you could borrow a paperback book, read it, take it with you if you haven't finished, and return it in any of the chain's locations during your next stay.'A Perfect Day' seemed like the least vile book of the available selection, so I took it & started reading it.What can I say? Since you probably already know the plot, I only need to warn you that it is executed in the most trivial, predictable, kitchy way possible. It seemed I knew every twist & turn pages before it actually happened, including he book's final resolution. Throughout the book I've felt this book was geared towards women, written by a man who thinks women only like reading tear jerkers of the skimpiest kinds.My advice: skip it - unless you need something to put you to sleep but are opposed to drugs. Or if you enjoy a good laugh at such badly written books."
4,Couldn't put it down,"When circumstances make it possible for Robert Harlan to devote himself fulltime to finishing a novel he started four years ago, he sees it as his chance to finally do something worthwhile with his life. Then his dreams came true with a vengeance. It only took a few pages and I was hooked on this book. Beautifully written, Robert makes all the classic mistakes of someone on whom fame is thrust. The story is not completely unpredictable. Everyday guy next door turns into an overnight famous jerk forgetting everything that's important in life. But Evans makes it work. I couldn't put this book down and for someone who reads voraciously, that's saying a lot."
4,A Perfect Day,I read a Winter Story and loved it so I felt I needed to read another book by same author. I am only halfway thru book and love it too! I'm a fan of Richard Evans.
5,It's Richard Evans,"A typical Evans tale, pure relaxation and escape. Also promotes love of family and right values. Anyone who likes Richard Evans will enjoy this book."
2,Not very good...could have been way better.,"I did not like this book, despite the content. I was looking forward to it very much, having played D&D; for over 20 years.First, the author has little ability to create good characters. I didn't care for any of them. Plus, he just throws things in or leaves you wanting more. There was a cool scene where the good guys capture some bad guys and they were going to interrogate them....could have been a great scene, but the author basically stated, ""the bandits were charmed, the alliance got their info, and then they sent the bandits on their way.""The author needs to expand on dialogue and characterization.Boring!"
3,"Worth reading, even if you never played the game...","An interesting story with some interesting characters but more detail into their lives and thoughts would have made this a better book. That being said, I think it is clearly the second-best of the Grayhawk series, behind the ever-popular Justicar books by Paul Kidd. The journey of the central character Shanhaevel from self-absorbed scholar to boon companion is rather well-done, and the supporting characters display just enough individualism to remain interesting. The storyline will be familar to old-time D&Ders, but I think that Reid did a reasonably good job of transferring a role-playing game into a novel, and those who are not familar with the game or that module will still enjoy reading this book. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep readers interested in the last page, and a tag at the last of the book insinuates that there may be another novel in the future dealing with these same characters, which I would welcome."
1,almost....,This bra is attractive- but doesn't wash well; after washing the padding clumps together and is not smooth.
2,Poor Bootsie?,"I enjoyed Bootsie Barker Bites and thought it genuinely clever; however, Bootsie Barker Ballerina is simply too agressive--and I do not generally consider myself to be politically correct about these things. Bootsie is mean to others and they are mean to her, which doesn't really teach positive moral values. And while morality isn't everything, the book lacks the spark that Bootsie Barker Bites had.My six-year old enjoyed this book, but she did not ask me to read it again."
3,I wish that there was a bit more to it,"Bootsie Barker is a girl who just loves being mean to everyone around her. And when Bernie decides to attend ballet class with Lisa, he finds that Bootsie Barker is right there up to her old tricks. Bernie's basketball coach won't let him drop out of ballet, so he is going to have to come up with another way to solve his Bootsie Barker problem.Overall, I thought that this was an OK book. It's true that this book does not teach an uplifting lesson, but relies on the little reader to find Bootsie Barker's antics funny and then enjoy seeing her getting her comeuppance. I don't know, I do wish that there was a bit more to it."
5,JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL!!,"Commander Bly is a straight repaint of the Clone Commander #33. Except this time around, he doesn't have the string and the other little thingy. His yellow paint isn't yellow enough, but he is still really cool!!! Over, a really cool figure. I'd recommend it any day."
2,Boring Book,The book arrived in good shape and was on time. I started reading it and thought it is going to pick up soon. The problem was it never did. I was disappointed and the other thing was I wanted more jack Wagner they only referenced him a couple of times.
4,Good way to learn.,Great basic tracks to solo over. Nothing fancy but perfect for beginner's who want to improvise over some varied 12 bar stuff.
1,I wish I had read the other review first!,"I totally agree... this book is full of factual errors, including stating that Murphy Brown singlehandedly brought down Dan Quayle. The editor of this book should bone up on grammer, fact-checking, etc. I found it very distressing that many women, from Queen Isabella to Belle Starr were treated with a giddy adulation that did not include the whole woman. I am very much a feminist and have enjoyed the other books from Conari Press and thought all of their products would be as high quality."
5,Great gift!,"I bought this as a gift for my son. I am going to back and buy a few more to use as birthday gifts. This book and a ream of paper kept three 9 year old boys self-entertained all weekend, and they still go back to it every once in a while."
1,HORRIBLE.......,"I bought this gift for my daughter thinking she would adore it. I were unable to get the thing to work, it would not accept voice activation when attempting to program it. I tried changing batteries, none of the voice activation commands worked at all. I ended up bringing it back & was going to try another one. I thought maybe I had the only one not working properly, then I read this. They were sold out at the store, so thankfully I was not able to get another one....Boy is she disappointed!"
1,What a disappointment!!,This was the main thing my daughter wanted for xmas. Three months later I finally gathered everything up in a grocery bag and took it back to the store because it had just sat collecting dust. Main reason being we couldn't get it open. It took 2 days to set the date. Then I figured since I could do that it would be ok to close it until we could work with it some more. We tried and tried to use the password but no luck. Honestly I think they need to take the thing off the market. It's a nice concept. I ended up getting her the barbie dairy instead. Much less stress and much cheaper. I know there are plenty of people out there that agree with me I only wish I would have listened to you before I bought it.
2,Medieval Cat Tarot,The artwork is well done but there is little life or energy in the pack. It is interesting for its difference.
5,Cat Lovers Deck!,"I like this deck because of the strong medieval theme and, while done a bit tongue-in-cheek with cats in period costumes, not overly cutesy. Very nice-looking deck and card stock, particularly for the money."
1,Ghost written by a monkey with a typewriter,"This book is the single worst book I have every read on a subject relating to engineering of any kind. The examples in the book, especially code examples, are so cryptic and unexplained that you would be better off searching for tutorials on google than wasting your time trying to read this garbage. I wish there was a rating below 1 star, this book deserves it."
4,real-time interfacing,this book is an exceptionally good book for both new comers to real-time interfacing and experienced programmers. It treats both the engineering and hands-on design of embedded systems using the Motorola microcontroller units. It comes with a simulator that is simple to use and lets you know how your design would work in these units. what it misses though as a suggestion is a chapter that would guide users to specific portions of the book for the various actuators it provides as an example.
1,worthless,"Have never seen dull serrated knife before. Enen knives from dollar stores can usually do the job. This one has tiny notches and thick blade edge. Does not cut,slice or chop. Cannnot be sharpened either..."
3,"Bargain speaker, it is good to get what you pay for",This is a very inexpensive CC speaker and it is very much worth the price. If you just need a CC that will provide clear voice in a small room - this will work fine. Don't buy this if you re looking for an audiophile product - it is not as good for music.
1,This thing is a mess,"We do not like this at all. The DVD player is never held like in the picture, it always slumps down & it is quite a disappointment. Do not waste your money."
3,Small,Nice case but can't watch my 8 inch player on battery power because battery attaches to back making it too large for the case.Like the feature expanding to two headphone jacks but use on plane limited by small size.
5,Great Product * * * * *,"Only one, why you don't ship to Canada, here's a lot of potencial buyers, we know the shipping it's a little more expensive, but who cares with these kind of items, I had to ordered it to a U.S. friend's address, and after a month I could pick it up, just a suggestion.Thanks"
1,Only good for soundtracks!!!!,"ok he does soundtracks fine, but his own music is pathetic!no doubt he is talented but he needs to be backing some talented songwriters for this to work!his slide playing is repetitious and boring, I have been playing guitar a long time and I've seen alot of guitar players with less talent make better music.There's more to making good music than being an awesome guitar player.(...)"
2,Too Clean,"I'm a big fan of Joy Divison and New Order. My Substance tape is worn down to a nub from playing it on the subway every day during university. The big problem with this collection is that all the songs sound so squeaky clean. Joy Divison is a dirty sounding band. By remastering the songs they've lost that. Other than that, all the main songs are there, good intro into Joy Division, but doesn't capture the feel."
3,"Nothing against the late Ian Curtis, but...","This collection is quite the superfluous item in anybody's music collection, I would think. This features moody, if not downright depressing, not to mention mediocre music material from a second-rate lead singer. Sorry, avid Joy Division fans who were probably around at the time that they were originally performing, in order to appreciate them better, that's just the way I feel. This CD is going to my local Bull Moose Music store to be sold soon, there's nothing Permanent about it at all to me. The bottom line is, New Order has always been so much more appealing and better-sounding, I glad they've lasted as long as they have. I'm outta here."
4,Good book!,I really like the guided meditations. They are short and easy to understand. I use them before I go to bed or right before I meditate.
3,Marriage Description,"It's been several years since high school graduation, and a few long time friends working at the same company are beginning to talk about marriage. Each of them has their own love dilemmas as wedding bells loom on the horizon! Are you the marrying kind?Two episode OVA about marriage."
5,Perfect for Crime!!!!,"This album, like tequila, makes me feel felonious...Track one - Song for going postal and shooting up your officeTrack two - Song to be played whilst commiting arson at nightTrack three - Song for doing massive amounts of heroin & cocaineTrack four - Song for engaging in a high speed chase with the copsI could go further but you get the picture. Only the strong minded can derive strength from Disco Volante. The rest drive minivans and go to PTA meetings..."
2,Bad power and lousy duplexer,I tried this printer for a few weeks before returning. It is excellent except for its power supply and duplexer. The power supply is so ill built that evertime the printer comes out of stand-by the lights dim and my UPS kicks in to keep the voltage to my PC. There are many comments on the Internet about this problem with Brother printers. The duplexer cycles even if only one side needs to be printed doubling the time for each page. Other than that it prints well and performs as advertised.
5,Laser Printer,Excellent printer. I especially liked the fact that it has 3 different interfaces. It can be configured to use any and all of them and as a network printer.
5,Above expectations,"We purchaced this printer to do two things. First, to solve driver issues with a Mac, and second to create a wireless printing network. On both accounts, the printer exceeded our expectations. The set-up for the wireless was a bit tricky, but the Brother customer service people were spectacular and the whole thing went flawlessly. The dual-sided printing works like a charm and the system is extremely fast and very quiet. This was a fantastic purchace and we would recommend it to anyone."
2,"Loud cracking noise, no toner warning","I have had this printer for about 6 months and I'm looking for an alternative in case this one breaks. It makes a LOUD cracking noise (like plastic snapping) on any duplex feed and many single-side feeds. I fear it is getting ready to break, and I can't afford to be without a printer ... so I am looking for an alternative.I would also note that when the idiot light goes on indicating low toner, you need to buy a replacement cartridge, even if the print quality is still fine. I am used to printers that indicate their toner is running out but still work well for weeks if you shake the cartridge. This one doesn't do that. When the printer decides it's out of toner, it will stop working even if there is toner left in the cartridge and the last pages you printed were fine."
4,So far so good,"The printer seems to be working well so far for our small nonprofit office. We have 6 workstations networked into it. It's much quieter than the HP 1200 series printer we had before. The duplex feature is nice to have as well. My only problem was with printing envelopes. The envelopes would come out wrinkled no matter how I oriented them. The troubleshooting guides lead you to believe that it's the envelope quality, but the envelopes have worked on 3 other printers. I finally called Brother and after a pain staking exercise in having a person read screen after screen of useless text, we found the problem. There are two blue tabs in the back of the printer that need to be pulled up to increase the roller gap. You shouldn't have to pay more than $150 for the printer if you look around."
4,Nice Network Printer with Duplexing,"Good printer (so far).Can't say ""I love it"" yet because:1. Depends on the reliability over the years.2. I experienced some problems with printing on pre-printed paper.Duplexing works nice, and I like that the printer can be connected via ethernet."
3,Noisy little box,"I've had this printer for about 3 months now. The first one I received I had returned through Brother as it was so noisy I was sure something was defective. Dealing with Brother's customer service went well and they were very accommodating. The new replacement printer, however, is only slightly less noisy. Clicks, pops, churns - this thing drives me nuts. I have it sitting right next to a Brother laser fax and find myself using the fax more frequently to print out documents as it is so much more quiet. I've owned laser printers for years and this is by far the noisiest printer to date. Sure, the actual prints are great and the printer itself was priced right, but I would return it if I could. I suppose if you had this thing networked and it wasn't sitting right on your own desk, it would work fine. If it's in the same room with you however, be prepared to turn up the music every time you want to print so you drown out all the noise."
3,"OK, just ok.","Had for 3 years. Have had problems with ink leaving the toner and I have to open it up and vacuum out the dried ink dust. I have put it thru a lot of use. It's like the energizer bunny. Now get a lite streak down the middle of the paper, so I just use it for times when a sharp copy is not necessary."
2,i didnt like it,i didnt like it i didnt like how part of the movie will go off ever 5 mints to 15mints then another part come on.
3,moderate action,This DVD is only moderate if you are someone who is really into action. the girls are pretty thought but look uncomfortable in the scennes. the guys were naturaly having a good time. overall a good buy but scout around and know what turns you on cause this one might not be potent enought for some.
4,Evidently Chickentown,"The song 'Evidently Chickentown' - played on the closing credits of The Sopranos on April 15th, 2007 is a track from John Copper Clarke's 1980 Album 'Snap Crackle & Bop' - now available as a remastered CD (on Amazon). If you liked the song and want to hear more from England's original Punk Poet, I would definitely recommend 'Snap Crackle & Bop'. Read the Amazon description of the CD to get a sense of what JCC is about... politically and socially savvy, sarcastic, wickedly humorous, great beats. I have loved this album since the 1980's, when he was hugely popular with the British punk crowd."
1,What happened to these guys?,"This album was incredibly dissapointing considering how good their first release was. It has a total of one good song, Simple Lessons, and it isnt even that good."
4,"It came, now it hangs","the flag works perfectly, it was cheap, came quickly, but was very wrinkled when i got it"
3,works well for short periods of time....,"The mister works as advertised, is fairly quiet, disperses fragrance well. Only drawback is the small capacity - mister needs to be refilled frequently throughout the day. Works best in a small room or office."
3,Mister,"This product works fine, it was just a lot smaller than I thought it would be and I don't think it is worth the price."
3,Questionable value,"I ignored the comment I read indicating that this product is cheaply made -- but shouldn't have. It works well enough, but I'm afraid that it will meet an untimely demise. Not a good value for the money paid -- there have got to be better deals out there."
4,great for the bedroom,"This mister does a nice job for a small room and is great in the bedroom if you sleep with no lights as its lights can be turned off where most them can't. Only con for this guy is that it does not run all night, but does allow me to fall asleep with lavender and sandalwood essential oils."
1,"UNreliable, to sensitive, not worth the money!","I didn't buy this one, it was a gift, but if I had I would have returned it by now. I'm so disappointed and I will still ask the person who gave it to me if they would like their money back.WHY IT ISN'T WORTH YOUR MONEY? It holds only a cup of water which will run out of within about 8 hrs. so not that great for leaving on at night. It is super lightweight (can be good for traveling) which means that if you accidently bump it, oops. water everywhere. The mist only SOMETIMES makes it's way out of the reservoir.WHY IS IT SO SENSITIVE? the water HAS to be warm or hot (not sure at what temp it works best), needs minerals to work (no filtered or pure water), and it seems like it shoots out the most mist when the level is around a 1/4 of an inch below the ""max water"" mark.That is just way to many things to be worrying about constantly!If you want something that you can just fill up, add some essential oils to, press on, and walk away..... THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!"
1,Not worth the money,This item is cheaply made and definitely not worth the $40.00 I spent on it. Stopped working in 3 uses.
5,I love it!!,"Does everything it said it would - send a fragrant mist into the air - and more! (Or else I just didn't read the full explanation.) It turns itself off before it goes completely dry, which, to me, is a fantastic feature!! You can either have the different colored lights on or off, which is great! We love it!"
2,Disappointing!,"Loved it when I got it, and for the week it worked. I was OK with the small size, but really sorry when the lights kept going but the misting stopped. I'd suggest you look elsewhere. I'm going to."
5,Transcends the genre,This gallon of milk in one word: Amazing. I've never realized how powerful the juice of a cow's nipple can make me. Now I understand. Buy this milk.
1,For race cars? Don't THINK SO !!!!,"I tried some of the stuff as an oil additive in my '03 Mach 1 drag car. The damn thing blew up on the 17th pass Wednesday night ! Well, maybe I bear some of the responsibility since I replace 3 of the 6 quarts with our esteemed Tuscan magic milk. Maybe I'll try it as traction compund next time !R. B."
4,"Cold, White Wonderful","As I lay in my non-oversized, non-jetted tub in my four star hotel in Portland, Oregon -- I unscrew the red plastic top of my beloved Tuscan Whole Milk. I savor the moment, taking a swig from my bottle of whiskey and swishing it slowly before I swallow. I'm building to the moment. Braving up for the inevitable splash of cold, white wonderful as it hits my joyful skin. ""Hummana!"" I exclaim, as the first drops hit my complimentary shower cap. Won't this be a treat. If only it came with a milkmaid.Four teAts UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,where's the milk?,"My wife had twins a few weeks ago. She was all like, ""Help me feed the twins, you bum."" Whatever. So my uncle, an ophthalmologist, tells me to drink Tuscan Whole Milk because I will develop breast muscles so I can breast-feed my two boys. I followed up on his advice, but a week later, not a single drop from my nips. What am I doing wrong? Worse, the price for a single gallon of whole milk has gone up by 40 dollars!!! I can't afford too much more just to find out if this stuff really works like my ophthalmologist uncle said it would."
2,Not quite bantha poo,"Having spent some time on Tatooine, I can safely say that this milk is nothing like the milk the Sand People drink. Since the name was intentionally misspelled, this listing falls short of false advertising, but it's still pretty disappointing."
3,"Decent nose, hearty, frothy body.","Goes best with Zurich imported toll house cookies or the Tunisian pre-October grain harvested frosted flakes. Oddly, when attempting to dunk domestic Oreo's, the leche Tuscano clashed so dramatically that it physically rejected the cookie discs from it's crystal mug. I suggest using the Austrian freeze-dried sandwich cookies, and even then, most judiciously to not offend the Tuscan bovine sensibility."
1,Offensive,"On November 27, 1978, San Francisco city supervisor Harvey Milk was brutally assassinated along with Mayor Moscone by a deranged madman. I cannot believe that Amazon would be so insensitive as to carry a product named in such a manner as to make light of this horrific crime. Shame on Tuscan and shame on Amazon for their mockery of this great martyred man. Clearly the ""whole"" in the name is wordplay on the ""holes"" left in Milk's body by the lunatic's bullets. What's next, Amazon? Will you start selling Tuscan Drowned Laci?"
1,"Design flaw, poor instructions","This product has a serious design flaw. When I removed this product from its container, it did not stand on its own as I expected. Instead, it spread out onto the ground, then appeared to disappear into it. For the price I paid, I would have expected this product to have a lot more substance. Someone told me that I needed a glass, but this is not listed in the instructions. Also, there are no clear instructions on how to open the container. I tried everything from cotton balls to a can opener, to no avail. Eventually I was able to open it by burning a hole in it with a curling iron. I was afraid to use a knife, since I didn't want to damage the product inside. Clearly, Tuscan needs to re-think this product.**Edit** It seems that I would have had to let this sit at room temperature for several days in order for it to stand on its own. Again, terrible instructions. I would also appreciate a product that was ready to use."
1,POISON! BEWARE!,"OK, I admit I have a serious, anaphylactic milk allergy. But after reading the reviews here, I thought this product sounded so magically wonderful that I'd give it a try anyway.Big mistake!!!I'm out of the hospital now and back at my computer, so that part's good. And I did get a helicopter ride to a major medical center, even if I wasn't awake for it.Still, all things considered, this product was a lousy purchase. The FDA needs to put a stop to the money-grubbing corporate monsters who market this stuff. Save your money, and save your life!"
2,Misleading image,"I found the picture of the milk to be totally inaccurate, though the description was spot on."
5,From the rivers edge...,"It was a quiet morning. The fog had risen to the height of the tree tops. The sun barely piercing through the eerie stillness of the forest where I found myself. I was in a daze for I hadn't remembered anything about how I got where I was or how I managed to survive. I know this now, it was August 2nd. My birthday. As I came to my senses I was astonished to find an empty gallon of Tuscan whole milk laying in a small puddle it created. This succulent liquid that it birthed onto this world. It was this same white liquid that I have come to call, ""Gods Tears."" Just calling it Milk wouldn't define it... Because of God's Tears, I am alive. Because of God's Tears, I am here."
5,I would recommend this milk to anyone.,"Within my nursing home they only serve this, rancid, rat-milked, tasting stuff. But as soon as I seen this, I knew I had to try it. It shipped within 3 days by UPS and when I took my first gulp I knew what my purpose was in life.Now I always carry atleast 5 gallons of this stuff with me and use it to fuel my hoverround.Thank you, Tuscan!"
2,I wish I'd ordered a sampler before we started,"The white color shown in the photos isn't NEARLY as strong once it's up on the walls and the consistency is far too thin in my opinion. My girlfriend and I had to use seven or eight layers to cover the (relatively gentle) mint-green color that we had in the living room and we couldn't stop it dripping, even when I used a roller. On the plus side, the Tuscan brand doesn't give the room that 'newly-decorated' smell that I normally hate so much, which is nice."
3,"Tastes like Thirty Eight dollar milk, tops.","I tried a gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, surprised at the price but willing to pay a little more for quality goods. I was disappointed in the quality, however. I have had a lot of milk in my day, being a cereal aficionado of years' experience. Despite what I thought a charming bouquet and a strong finish, I found the aftertaste and the longevity of the Tuscan Whole Milk to be that of a slightly cheaper milk."
1,"Anti American, and immoral?","hmmmm....you know that cow over the moon thing is not really a Christian thing to look at. Is Tuscan sayin' we start worshipping cows or somethin'? And what's up with the red color. I smell Communism. Red commie baby-eatin' vampire cows, that's what they are!"
5,A Social Tsunami?,Does selling milk over the Web mean that our nation's next generation of illegitimate children will be fathered by the FedEx man?
5,best milk ever?,I was RAVING over the NINTENDO 64!!!!!!!!!!!!1111 but this milk is the bomb man. Brian Peppers approved!
1,What's so great about Tucson milk?,"I mean, cow's a cow whether it comes from Texas or Arizona, right? I mean, I've been to Tucson, it's not that great. I don't know how cows even survive in that heat.Oh, TUSCAN milk! yeah, that's probably pretty good."
3,Okay product but you have to buy a glass to use it.,Don't get fooled by the easy-to-use look of this product.
5,Unlike any other product available,"This is an unbelievable combination of a fine product, exceptional packaging, and user-friendly design. I will buy this again... Oh yes!"
2,Not quite like back home,"This product was wonderfully delicious, but very cold, and did not separate into the differently textured and flavored milk products I recall from my youth. Milk should be warm (about cow temperature) and served fresh, or allowed to sit and separate into cream (which floats on top) and low-fat milk so that the user can make use of the product both in EXTRA FLAVOR and DIET varieties. By the way, if you put the creamy top layer of a proper milk into a container and shake it for a while, you can make your own BUTTER and BUTTERMILK. I was unable to do any of this with the Tuscan Whole Milk at all, so I had to drop it's score from what would have been 4 stars. Any milk which can't be used properly is obviously defective, as are (in my opinion) the people who WANT their milk that way."
1,The Chinese Curse Reversed,"I-I knew that Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz would change my life from the moment I first saw it. The purity of its shape, its color...it was an epiphany waiting to happen. I knew it. Oh, I knew it. But...The promise of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz didn't live up to my expectations. Its creamy paleness hid lies-- lies and hideous deceptions. It was nothing more than a milky incubus, waiting to lure you into pallid serenity.Please, for your sake, don't fall for Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz's sly promises. It's nothing more than milk, and not a pathway to adventure after all."
3,Mildly satisfied.,"Tuscan whole milk, it turns out, is a poor and unhygenic lubricant. ""I have,"" in the words of an eminent, New-York-Times-published milk scholar, ""no further comments to add."""
3,"Save Money, Buy Used","I think that the new milk is a bit overpriced, but you can sometimes get a real deal on the Used Milk. I don't think that most users will notice a difference, especially if you find some in Excellent or Nearly New condition."
1,Evil thieves! Do not buy this milk!,"I am a Tuscan native with a small herd of cows. All of this season's calves starved and died. Turns out, these guys steal the milk from my heifers at night to sell to you uppity have-it-all wannabees. Do not promote such practices! Boycott this product!"
5,A Breakfast Treat!,"I have found, through much trial and error, that one cup ofTuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl ozto two cups ofUranium Ore, one cup ofBisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3), and oneEmu Eggmakes for amazing, light, fluffy pancakes. Whats more, not only do they taste delicious, they are easily found in a darkened room due to their pleasing unearthly green glow. Your kids will love them, and better yet, they can be used for a valuable lesson in financial management! The repeated tooth loss that rapidly follows can be used to teach your children about money management due to the windfall they will realize due to repeated visits from the Tooth Fairy. Trust me, no family should be without these fine products. Alone they are valuable in and of themselves. Combined, you will positively glow with the quantum leap your taste buds will experience as they transition into a new state of scintillation that does not decay."
2,Yawn,It's just a bigger version of Tuscan Whole Milk 64 fl oz. No USB ports. Doesn't support Flash. Lame.
3,What? No Chocolate,The item arrived and had an expiration date on it of only a week and half. What's that all about? Why no Chocolate version of this model?
1,Milk Sucks.,"Milk, let's see here. I have never been able to enjoy it's silky smooth texture without a severe stomach ache, or throwing up. Therefore, it can only receive One Star in my eyes. That makes it a terrible product, and you shouldn't buy it. It's a waste of money, and those poor, poor cows..."
1,Give Credit Where Credit's Due,"I'm here to tell everyone the truth about this so called 'tuscan' milk.It was my great grandfather, Pasquale Iandoli who originally perfected the recipe for a full bodied, incredibly satisfying milk beverage. It was a great success in his home town of Apice Benevento Italy, and brought with it large quanties of money. With that money, he was able to act as a supporter of Mussolini. Well, I don't have to tell you that with the fall of facism, Pasquale had to leave Italy, and fast! He only had one copy of the recipe with him and while traveling to America it was stolen by a shipmate. This person subsequently popularized it in the states, and ignorantly claims it to be 'Tuscan' milk, when clearly it tastes distinctly of Napoli."
1,Doesn't Work with Macs,"Beware! I poured the milk into my MacBook Pro's firewire port and immediately got a kernal panic. I tried again on my iMac and got the same result. Come on, Tuscan, get with it!"
3,Don't be mislead by the picture--it's big!,"The picture makes it look pretty small, but this thing is BIG. Like almost a foot tall. Even if you click to enlarge the picture, it doesn't get as big as the actual jug. Of the three pictures they provide, the middle picture is the least accurate. The left one is a little better but still not realistic. Make sure you have space in your fridge!"
3,a sailor,"I am as a sailor, upon seas of tuscan milk. Looking out for icebergs, I lick splishy splashes of milk from my sweaty brow, up in the crow's nast. I sail the tuscan sea, looking for a friend."
5,"From Tuscany, or Wisconsin?","Aaah ... reminds me of my time in Tuscany, wishing I had cold, creamy cow's milk for my morning cereal rather than that long-shelf-life swill that comes in a box."
5,Best Milk Ever,"There's nothing I enjoy more than after a long bike ride through the Alps with my wives to drink about 5 gallons of this. It also works great as paint thinner, shampoo, and [...]. I strongly reccomend it to athletes and husbands alike.Also, if you ingest this while eating lingonberries, you will start to hallucinate. I found out that I'll die in a depressurization accident on Sweden's first moon colony. Thanks, Tuscan Milk! No more space travel for me! ;-)"
2,Not suitable for the English milk lover,"I'm from England (good evening America) and was completed taken in with this product after reading all 1267 (some rather entertaining) reviews. I put the milk into my basket (virtual of course as this is the interweb) and paid. I waited and waited and eventually my milk was delivered. I prepared my cup of (milkless) tea and some buttered crumpets, opened the carton and was greated by what I could only decribe as yogurt. I tried to drink my yogurt-tea but was unable as it was rather poor. Thank you for your time America, Simon"
2,Overrated,"Everyone's been talking up this Tuscan Milk recently like it's the cat's pajamas. I finally had a chance to try this milk recently, and I can only say: Don't believe the hype. Sure, it's got a wonderful matte white color and some impressive packaging, and the B-vitamin content is nothing to sniff at. It's a technically fine milk, but there's no soul here; it's all style and no substance. After drinking this milk, you'll merely feel slightly less thirsty. Great milk does more than that; it opens doors, and changes the way you think about the world. For all Tuscan Milk's flash and ambition, it's an empty beverage.If you're looking for a more satisfying experience, I suggest Parmalat Skim Milk, Carton, 32 fl oz. One of the year's most underrated milks."
2,How can you beat Carnation canned milk?,"How can you beat Carnation canned milk? As the poet said,Carnation Milk is the best in the land;Here I sit with a can in my hand --No t*ts to pull, no hay to pitch,You just punch a hole in the son of a b*tch.""The Virtues of Carnation Milk,"" from ""The Oxford Book of American Light Verse"" (William Harmond)."
3,Had no idea what it was...,"Being left-handed caused a problem here. I thought it was an industrial-sized bottle of 'correction fluid'. 6 weeks later I came to discover that my 'white out' has become very chunky and wasn't offering the same coverage as it did right after I bought it. Extremely angry, I grabbed the container in my right hand and dialed the phone with my left... With the label for MILK now fully apparent I felt like a fool. I reamianed on the phone to let them know that their container was defective!"
4,Me and my dyslexia!,"I ordered this milk thinking it was from Tucson, but when it arrived it didn't taste anything like milk from Tucson. That's when I took another look at the label.It's good milk, it just wasn't what I thought I was ordering."
1,A Poor Cow's Imitation,"My family and friends and I have begun a boycott of Amazon.com's grocery service (beginning directly after the writing of this comment) for their blatant disregard for the milk connoisseurs of the world.Where is the Organic Cow of Vermont? The world's best milk has been completely ignored by this service, replaced with this so called ""whole"" milk that is most certainly lacking in ""whole""-ness. Real, honest to goodness milk, when ""whole""-ly experienced, should be four dimensional, should react on the senses in a way no other substance can. Only the Organic Cow of Vermont provides this experience, and until it is added to this catalogue, I will continue to make the trek to my neighbourhood grocery store.Take that, convenience. :P"
2,misrepresented.,i was disappointed with this product. it wasn't what i was expecting at all. there needs to be a better description so people know what they are getting into!
2,NOT As Described!,"When I bought this lovely bottle of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz, I measures the contents, and found that there were only 127 FL OZ! What a rip off! I want my 128 Fl Oz, and i'm gonna get them! Be warned, buyers!"
5,Awesome,this is by far the most awesome thing ever but my shrink says if I take these pills i won't see you guys anymore
4,Where is my 128th ounce???,"Hey Chris Coffman from St. Louis, MO, I believe you got my 128th ounce.My warm chunky jug jug of gooy white liquid only came with 127 fl. oz.If I send you 3 cents, could you send me the extra ounce?"
1,Poor Return Policy,1. Bought the milk.2. Disliked the milk.3. Returned the milk.4. Charged a $14.95 restocking fee.P.S. I also bought the 4.5 lbs. of Chiquita Bananas. Best damn bananas ever!
1,Warning: Wild Boar Exploitation,"While researching primary animal species of the Tuscan region under a grant from the Homeland Security Department I discovered that dairy farming is in fact almost non-existent. There do however seem to be an abundance of wild boar or Cinghiali in the area.Am I the only one who's wondering if this is in fact not cow's milk at all, but deceptively packaged milk from the poor pitiful overworked teats of exploited Cinghiali sows?Where is PETA when they're needed? Why are we tolerating this wicked profiteering on the backs... err, teats of these sad little creatures?A cow is a sow is a boy! Fight the power!"
1,Amazon-are you serious?,"How can one be sure of purchasing a product when there is not even a complete description? And not to mention, not even a correct description? ""While milk""? That doesn't even make sense! How can I buy something when I don't even truly know what it is? Now I am going to have to wander around the vast interwebs and find out for myself!"
1,Bait and Switch,"Despite the advertised name and label, this milk is not from Tuscany, nor from the moon, nor from flying cattle. Caveat Emptor."
5,How do I love thee,"How do I love thee, Tuscan whole milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz, Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and height of a full, frosty glassMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight, your taste is so sweet, to my tongues own delightFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace, drinking Tuscan whole milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz, is better than getting sprayed with maceI love thee to the level of everyday's, blowing bubbles outside, soaking in the suns warming raysMost quiet need, by sun and candle-light, I wish I could buy more Tuscan whole milk, 1 gallon 128 fl oz, but my budget is tightI love thee with the passion put to use, I share you with friends, my morals are looseSmiles, tears, of all my life! - and, if God only choose, I'd forever drink Tuscan whole milk, 1 gallon, 128 fl oz, and forgo the boozeI shall but love thee better after death, but that won't be soon, so don't hold your breath."
5,Why did the elephant go to the dentist?,Tuska loosa.Get it? Like Tuscaloosa AL. I guess you'd have to be there.Who can? Tuscan! I will say nothing of milk.
4,Describing this product accurately is complicated,"Comparing these examples with their parasitic gap counterparts in (96) and (97), we see that any associated supporting element suffices to account for the extended c-command discussed in connection with (34). To characterize a linguistic level L, a subset of English sentences interesting on quite independent grounds does not readily tolerate the traditional practice of grammarians. Analogously, the earlier discussion of deviance cannot be arbitrary in a descriptive fact. Presumably, this selectionally introduced contextual feature is not to be considered in determining the requirement that branching is not tolerated within the dominance scope of a complex symbol. I suggested that these results would follow from the assumption that this analysis of a formative as a pair of sets of features is, apparently, determined by a corpus of utterance tokens upon which conformity has been defined by the paired utterance test."
1,Sour grapes,One star for not offering Strawberry and for making a weak moustache. Too watered down to be Whole.
2,form factor inhibits this PMCD,"It's shocking how little innovation there is in the Personal Milk Consumption Device space. To start with, the form factor is not ideal. When the device is full, it sometimes requires two handed operation. Not optimal, especially when using other devices simultaneously. There's no spill-containment mechanism, which in the year 2006 should be standard. And then there's the materials and packaging. The case just feels cheap and disposable. For $3.29, I expect more robust packaging.The milk itself seems tasty enough."
5,Bubbles,"Sunlight streams through cracked blinds, casting slits of light on a yellowed bedspread. A tipped bottle of ""Old Crow"" Kentucky Bourbon balances on the nightstand. A few inches away the pale face of a ""Lady of the Night"" sleeps, a soft mustache on her upper lip.Honk, Honk, Honk, below the 4th floor apartments window a car alarm goes off, awaking the large man next to the hooker. He stumbles from his bed, naked, smelling of sex and cheap whiskey. In the fridge he finds a week past date gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, and takes a swig. He is surprised to find it still fresh past the expiration date.This is just another morning like any other for every kids favorite TV clown..."
5,Top drawer Bing Crosby,"For several years I have had a scratchy LP version of this most enjoyable recording. For me the big question was: ""Will the digital version be as good as, or surpass, the original?"" I can enthusiastically say the engineers did a superb restoration job on this production. The sound is incredibly clear and vibrant. This disc certainly belongs in the top echelon of outstanding Bing Crosby recordings. Everything works well together. Mr. Crosby in in fine voice. The arrangements, although nearly 50 years old, still sound fresh and catchy. And there is a spirit of commaradarie that is truly infectious. This is the kind of music that deserves continued hearing and preservation. What a blessing to have it still available."
4,very punkish!,"This sound track is awesome!! I liked the movie a whole lot and it had a lot of punk music in it, so I bought the sound track. It really rocks. The only reason I didnt' rank 5 stars is because one song is not on there from the movie (where Angus dances with that chick at the end). But otherwise it's got a great variety of some good bands like Green Day and the Riverdales. J.A.R. is really a good song and if you like green day a lot, i'd recommend this cd for you."
2,Sorta kinda does a decent job...,"I bought one of these jigs a few years ago thinking ""hey, now I can cut dovetails on the cheap.""First, remember, this jig only does half-blind dovetails. So, if you want to Dovetail a box, you can't get those great looking through DT's..Because the jig is so narrow, it seems to take forever to cut the joints. You cut maybe seven, then you have to reset the jig. And those screw clamps take some time to get set for the cuts.Now, on the plus side, it was pretty easy to get this set up and cutting. And, it did a fair job with the joints.And, you don't need a guide bushing or collar - the supplied base has an indexing bar that registers the router.Once I upgraded to the Keller dovetail jig, I gave this to my brother in law for his shop. He has since replaced his jig and chucked this. But, hey, it worked for him for a few years."
3,Great resource - bad binding,"This is an excellent study companion and a great translation. However, the binding on the hardcover SUCKS! I thought it would be bound with string, but instead the publisher has used the cheapest glue known to man. I am being extra carful with it due to this really annoying defect."
3,Excellent for beginners.,I was hoping for more sample photos. Great instructions on basic composition techniques. Excellent for new quilters who need suggestions or step by step instructions for setting squares.
2,More for woman studies,"I had hoped that this VHS was similar to Lisa Ling and her DVD ""Surviving Maximum Security"". This is more of a psychological approach to why women kill their spouses...not what life is behind bars."
5,"Kenn, please go on writing!","My 9 year old son, who is bright but hates any kind of nonfiction, swallowed both this book and ""Algebra Unplugged"" like it was the latest fantasy bestseller. Really, we need books like this on any imaginable subject matter. Just a word of warning to other parents: there is some mild adult humor and some cultural references which might not make a lot of sense to kids."
1,Disappointed!,"As a woman who developed vulvodynia twenty years ago, I find Dr. Stewart's chapter on the subject woefully behind the times in her treatments and understanding of the disorder. My personal experience has proven that a low-oxalate diet and related therapies, as pioneered by Dr. Clive C. Solomons, can control the symptoms and pain in a non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical manner. This information is available for Dr Stewart to study, however, she relies on the outdated, harmful, ineffective therapies of the medical ""good ol' boys"". What a big fat disappointment!"
1,inaccurate iformation about vulvodynia,"While Dr Stewart has brought an important subject into the public eye and has written a comprehensive book, she perpetuates many inaccuracies concerning the Low Oxalate dietand Calcium Citrate treatment for vulvodynia.These innacuracies presented as the latest research will deter many readers who suffer from this disease from benefitting from a safe therapy that will help them."
4,"What's present, what's missing","This otherwise excellent book, that demystifies the ""forbidden"" zone and offers much useful information is lacking in that it omits serious and detailed discussion of any holistic/alternative approaches to this area of the body--how to keep it healthy, what to do if there is illness or trouble, such as a sexually transmitted virus (like HPV) or an abnormal Pap smear. For this, I recommend the excellent book WOMEN AT RISK by Henderson, Warshowsky and Yasgur. It offers conventional and alternative approaches to vulvovaginal health in general and HPV-related issues in particular. As a health educator I can say this is the best book I've found, and the only one that has any reliable information about alternatives."
2,Too Basic/General in Information,"I bought this book looking for more in-depth information about Women's Health, but the info provided was very basic. I didn't really learn anything new or interesting and it was kind of repetitive. It wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't a thorough as it appeared to be. I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking more detailed information."
2,OK but...,"This book covers the basics, and gives small to very little information on other things.I would love if this book gave some home remedies or things you can do to avoid UTI's or other things. But it doesn't just names surgery or medication boooo for this book! Waste of money"
4,Primus @ home,"Most concert DVD's that are being released do a really good job of capturing the live concert experience. The Primus ""Hallucino-Genetics-Live 2004"" DVD is no exception!! The sound quality is GREAT!!! The songs are unbelievable (the whole entire Frizzle Fry album performed live!!!) The picture quality is a little grainy and the camera shots could have perhaps been closer to the band. Overall, this DVD rocks and is a must have for any PRIMUS fan!!!"
4,More Tim Herb shots,"The show is awesome, specially the second set, wich is full of energy and the good ol' Primus i missed for long time. watching this guys playing the whole Fryzle Fry album brings good memories. Tim didnt get enough camera time, a real shame, cause he's an excellent drummer. At first, set one could be a little dissapointing but when they star playing To Defy The Laws Of Tradition the show became magnificent.If you are a true fan of Primus should own this, Also recomemnded: Animals Should Not Try To Act Like People."
2,Beware,Buyer beware - I got just what it says - not what you see - My wife has been working hard and deserved a special moment so I ordered this for mother's day to serve her expresso in bed with breakfast - paid 2 day shipping - the cup arrived in 2 days very well packaged - but without the pictured saucer - so much for the one chance to make a good impression
5,kids love it,"My boys love this video. They are 6 1/2 and 3 1/2 and just crack up at it, and so do I. We even lost it once and I had to buy it again as they missed it and always asked about it. Great video."
5,KIDS LOVE TOM & JERRY,My grandson just loves Tom & Jerry. The music accompanying the cartoon is awesome! Classical! Would highly recommend!
5,Old Time Tom and Jerry,We loved this DVD. It's the old cartoons and they are great. We have been disappointed with the newer Tom and Jerry and were so happy to find this one. We were all laughing.
3,Original Tom & Jerry - For Older Children,"Absolutely great videos of the original Tom & Jerry t.v. cartoon series we all remember from childhood. BUT, clearly too violent for toddlers and little ones. My kids flinched and asked to turn it off. Definitely for older kids. We stored it away for later, much later."
1,Don't bother,"Tom and Jerry, a wonderful childhood memory and a wonderfully entertaining comedic duo, have been butchered for DVD release. ""The Little Orphan"" contains an edit which is so idiotic that I cannot recommend this DVD. I would not even buy this at a bargain price. I don't care if everything else is uncut, one edit is all it takes. It is sad that some of the greatest animated characters have to be butchered just to be politically correct. One scene is cut while modern cartoons, full of innuendos and violence, recieve no such censoring. Do not support censorship and avoid this DVD."
5,"Superb,,,Couldn't be more pleased","The movies are wonderful, exactly as expected. Fast turn around and excellent service but I have never gotten less from Amazon.Thank YouSandy Morgan"
1,it sliced my finger,I bought four of these for my 6 mos old daughter and my 13 mos old neice for our trip to Israel.(it was in the 90's most of the time) The cage around the blade is very flimsy. It was on my daughters stroller and I was adjusting it to be on her and my finger slipped through the cage and the blade sliced my finger. Thank goodness this happened to me before it happened to my daughter. The firdt thing she tried to do was grab at it. This product should be recalled. I returned all four.Zero stars indeed.
3,mosquito-free zone,"Mosquitoes aren't much of a problem on a windy day. With this in mind, we kept this fan going on the stroller or pack'n'play when my son was an infant and it really helped! I'm not much for slathering an infant with DEET and this little fan was MUCH better than leaving him at the mercy of the 'skeeters. It's fine for little fingers, but the clip doesn't hold perfectly on the round bars of our stroller. Biggest downside is this fan is not very durable. Two have broken on us, and now I'm shopping for either this one or a similar but more durable one for my daughter."
4,Good buy for the money,"Decent price, good qualty, that's almost all you need. I just wish it came with more software options. (ie webcam over network or internet). But at this price, I can always find an app online!"
2,Does not work with netmeeting. Low quality Driver Software.,"We got this camera so grandmother/granddaughter could see each other. We have an H.323 capable video phone and need to use Microsoft netmeeting to connect to this from a PC. The current Logitech drivers (version 10.5) do not support Netmeeting (Windows actually gives a blue screen of death as a result of these driver). I'm disappointed with the fact the drivers for this camera are so poor.Before buying this camera, I'd recommend going to Logitech's website and looking at their User Discussion Forums for the list of issues.Camera was returned."
4,The Review,"The Logitech QuickCam Pro 5000 WebCam has been a wonderful webcam thus far since I purchased it October of 2006. It is extremly easy to set up. Just rember NOT to plug in the webcam first. I was told it will mess the camera and the computer up. This camera is perfect if you plan on talking to people via webcam. The quality is good, NOT great. It's better then most, but could be improved. I upload alot of video's on YouTube and the quality of upload has not been great with this camera. Which is why I personally gave it 4 stars. Also be careful with lighting around this camera, and the color black. Whenever I wear a black shirt other colors run through it. Other then that it has been a wonderful camera. Enjoy!"
5,QuickCam enables me to talk with my preschool nieces each morning!,"I live in Houston, TX. and I look forward to saying ""GOOD MORNING"" to my nieces in Canada each morning via the Logitech WebCam. When I purchased the Pro 5000 model for each of them as Christmas gifts, I had no idea how much fun it would be for the little ones to actually SEE my 3 pets and me while we talk! They can't wait to finish breakfast and to get dressed before we chat with each other. This is going to be a gift that we ALLLL can enjoy throughout the year!Kay in Houston"
4,QuickCam Pro 5000 worth the price,"I bought the cam based on reviews that I read and was aware of the shortcomings regarding the software. The shortcomings with the software are that you cannot use their microphone driver without getting the ""blue screen of death"". Logitech knows of the problem and had a fix on their website. The fix works but you ending using the native microphone driver. Doing this prevents the use of Logitech's echo reduction feature.That aside, the camera is excellent and that made it worth the price. I'm hoping that Logitech will fix the software sometime in the next millennia"
1,Paperweight,After an hour (so far) of trying to get this thing to work - no luck. I have a Dell Latitude laptop that is less than 3 months old so my system is pretty up to date. If I ever get it to work maybe I can write a more positive review.
2,"quality is ok, but cannot stay still on top of the monitor","quality is ok, nothing exciting nothing to complain too. but the design of the stand cannot stay still on top of the monitor, very annoying"
4,This is a good cam !,"This is a great cam for the price. It has very good low light capabities. The only problem I have encountered is a low frame refresh. I am running Win 2K, with 3/4 Gig of Mem a 2.5 Ghrz CPU, DSL and USB2. I cannot get a decent Frame refresh rate on this thing - I still need to try adjusting the Pixel rate of the cam to see if this has any effect on the frame refresh rate.Focal quality is excellent and the microfone is very good. Aside from the frame refresh issue it is an excellent product."
3,"Good camera, BAD software!","You should be warned before purchasing this - IT MAY CRASH YOUR COMPUTER! I installed this just before April Fool's Day, and the joke was on me. After it crashed my computer and I had to restore all my files, I realized that I have to unplug the camera before I reboot the computer, otherwise the computer just keeps rebooting. It is a driver problem with the included software, which is necessary to operate the camera. My system operates on Windows XP, on a computer which is about a year old now. The camera itself is okay, but I would NOT buy this product again, because of the driver problem. BE WARNED!"
2,Software nightmares,Logitech comes out with an update for this videocam about every 4-6 months. I have loaded about 3 updates since getting this videocam about a year ago. Each updates take about 15 minutes to load and install. Invariably something doesn't work after loading the update. After installing the May 2007 update I had restore the computer to get the webcam to work again.
4,Good so far!,"I bought this camcorder because I knew that it was supported by Mac. I use it with Yahoo Instant Messenger on my Mac, and everything works fine. I liked so much that I bought one for my mom, too. Since the Mac version of Yahoo IM doesn't support audio yet, I haven't had a chance to test the microphone."
5,Super Web Camera,"I absolutely love it. I use it to see and make faces at my new granddaughter who is in Chile (I am in Philadelphia, PA). Great price for a quality item."
1,Missing a Pillow for $23,"I ordered this in January and did not receive this ""in stock"" item until late March after much exchange with Amazon on my missing order. When the items arrived, the box said ""happy pillow"" but inside there was not a pillow, but only a pillow case?!?! I didn't pay $23 for a pillow case, I ordered a pillow AND the case... I would not order this until Amamzon figures out if a pillow actually ships with this... Also, this particular Amazon partner is poor at best. The in - stock items don't ship and their responsiveness is lacking."
2,a film i still haven't forgot despite my efforts...,"i'm sorry to write this, but this was one of the worse movies i have ever seen... i remember seeing this in the theater in lisbon and actually falling asleep during it. i am giving it two stars though: one for the madredeus, which are in fact worth listening to (but for this you should rather buy their cds). the other one is for that scene where manoel de oliveira (mdo) does a fantastic charlot. for those not familiar with mdo, he is the only filme director alive to have directed silent movies back in the 20s and 30s... he still directs fairly good movies...as for the rest of the movie, it isnt even original. i think wenders has another movie on a similar character randomly filming berlin (if i am not mistaken)..."
3,great kittybox,"I have 4 cats and 3 litter boxes thru out my home which I always thought looked messy. The new hidden planter-kitty box is a great idea and looks great in any of my rooms. The only suggestion I have would be to have the ""fake"" plant part look more real. The cheap material used for the plant part almost kills the great idea of the box. For $100+, I think a better material should be used. With that being said, I plan to order one more. I've replaced the fake plant part with pretty beaded branches."
3,"Probably a good thing for some people, not for me.","This looks much better in the living room (which I take great pride in keeping clean and orderly) than regular little boxes. However, it is very difficult for me to get the cover back on, bending over the whole time trying to wrestle with the top portion. It also doesn't contain thrown-out litter that well. I feel it is overpriced for the materials and size, etc. I would recommend it to people who really want the decorative aspect."
4,Keeps the Cats Going Where They Should,"I started having issues with one or both of my cats going on the floor. Very frustrating. I have a top loading cat box and while it was being used, so was the floor. I saw this hidden cat box on a flight magazine and knew I needed it, but didn't like the high price. Amazon's price is considerably cheaper, so even though it's substantial for a cat box, I got it. This has been great! Not a problem with the cats going elsewhere since. Now they go back and forth from the top-loading box and the hidden litter box. I put a doggie piddle pad on the bottom and then tape a jumbo liter liner onto the inside. This makes clean-up much easier. I am very pleased with this purchase!"
1,thinking of purchasing,"I need to know how wide it is? The description only says it's 42"" high. I have to know how wide to see if it'll fit in my space."
2,Way too much money,"The seller was very good and the product came on time..but I have to say that this Litter box is way over priced..The idea is good, But i was disappointed..:( It is all plasic and the top of the box does not fit..."
3,a little overpriced,I wanted a cat litter box that did not look like a cat litter box for my small apartment. It looks pretty good but the artificial plant is not quite what I expected. It does surprise people when they see my cat go into the side of the pot. I did think this one was a little overpriced but otherwise I am somewhat satisfied.
2,Good idea for my office appearance but bad to use,"I bought this for my office. My husband does the litter boxes and he hates it. It's not easy to reassemble after taking the used litter out. The cats chewed on the fake plant and threw up. It now sits in the basement unused. I'm back to looking at the litterbox with a cover, filter and handle. I can move that out of my office. Like a fine porcelin, it's pretty to look at but not practical."
5,"Krall ""nails"" the soul of Rio","One man's opinion-- Diana Krall can play any kind of music she wants to and create a masterpiece work of art. I have read a review (not of this video however)with an observation that the quality of sound was not ""up to snuff"". Perhaps, like myself, he does not have television with a sound system that can fully handle thefull subtlety and power of the music; but it is mesmerizing to watch Diana and her band work. Until I can upgrade my video equipment, I purchase the CD of theperformance as well and play it on my old but superb Yamaha component system and listen with my eyes closed so I focus entirely on the sound. I don't mind a bitto experience the performance more than once--once for the visual and again for the aural experience."
4,"Mom, You're Fired","Tina is embarrassed by her mother's actions and clothes. Tina wishes her mom was like her friend's mom. A new girl moves into the neighborhood, and Tina tells her that her mother is really her babysitter! One lie leads to another. Tina finally goes too far and a mother/ daughter discussion takes place. A great book for parents and children."
5,Very comfortable,I love these front closing bras. For some reason the Toast color seems to hold up better than the white one though.
3,A passable western,"This film has great stars which was typical of MGM films of the 1950's. Robert Taylor is one of my favorite actors, Ava Garder is very beautiful, and Howard Keel is O.K. But Anthony Quinn was acting over the top. Was a Mexican supposed to be like this? Shouting, gesticulating, emoting like a wild animal? You have to notice him when he is on the screen. Contrast him with Taylor. I prefer the minimal acting type of Taylor. There are many kind of love stories. The greatest one is between Quinn and Taylor, though mainly Quinn shows it. It is sometimes hard to understand the motivations of these people. There is a priest who talks about peace (do not kill!), but he is using guns like everybody else. Maybe motivation is not important in this kind of classy western. It is a watchable film, but not a great one (I give five stars only to Rio Bravo, Warlock and Magnificent Seven)."
3,feet?,"why, pray tell, does the baby Little Mermaid have FEET??????? and legs too! I would really appreciate if somebody would explain this to me..."
4,works,"gets the job done, I use it for my coby ipod look alike. Just kind of a pain turning off with my coby bc its on the side which is covered by the ...cover."
4,Interesting!,"This is one of Bob James' supplemental CD's in his discography. This album comprises ten selections (the majority of which are remixes)of music from the TV series ""TAXI"". It is in ""theme and variation"" form, with the theme appearing last. The individual variations take their character from portions of the theme itself. Bob is able to get away with this due to his having a Masters in composition. ""Hello Nardo"" (variation 6) contains references to both ""Shamboozie"" and ""Janus"" (see HANDS DOWN). It is the CD's best track. Some of the luminary musicians on this CD include Tom Scott, Michael Brecker, Eric Gale, Gary King, Dave Friedman, and the late Mike Lawrence. Also present is the familliar recorder work of George Marge. The TV version is here in full along with the ending salutation (Good Night, Mr. Walters"") (""Groan"")."
2,Book Description,"A Vast, underground computer network controls all the free world's missiles, security data, and surveillance systems. It is guarded by an unbreakable master code.But someone has broken it. Someone has fed to the Russians the means to explode the West's defenses with a single flick of a switch.Now Field Agent Conroy, a suspect himself, begins his own search for the traitor. A search that leads him to the genius who created the computer...to the head od British intelligence...and to a beautiful agent he trusts against his own instincts.Because there is no one else. And time is running out."
4,Jack Boy,"I think this video as a begining one is good. For a forensic class, this works as a begining. It does not have much depth to it, but it does cover the murders Jack the Ripper is blamed for. They do touch on a couple of theories very quickly. I was looking for a more historic biography of Jack the Ripper. I almost obtained that goal. The students in my high school class thought is was good."
2,"Works, but could it be any uglier?","Single IDE drive enclosures are very simple devices. I would not expect anything to go wrong on a device like this. Here's my impression on the product:Pros-Easy installation of both the drive and connecting to the computer.-Silent, fanless design.Cons-Looks very cheap. From the vertical stand to the aluminum case, everything is visibly cheap.-Rubber pads to protect case (those little things that will prevent your table from scratching when you put the enclosure on top of it) fell off the unit on the first hour. Two out of four were missing when I bought it.-Even thought you can turn it off, the hard drive status light is a big, ugly Mad Dog logo.I returned this unit."
4,Works ok,"It's just a piece of rubber and you wrap your cables around it.I could see some problems using this depending on how thick your cables are (if too thin it might not grab cable tight enough) and on how active you are while using it, but for me it works alright. I mostly use it to wrap my earbuds when I store them away in my pocket or backpack so I have no problem with it weighting down on the cords as someone mentioned, but I can see how that would be a problem. I also wouldn't recommend this to anyone that wants to have it dangling while running with your iPod for example. Although, if you wrap your cables close to your iPod, it should be more secure than having this thing midway through the cord.Overall, it's not perfect, but it beats having your cable dangling all over the place, especially when putting your iPod/earbuds away in your bag or pocket."
3,meh,It would be useful but it's too flimsy. The hooks barely keep the cord hooked in. I'd get something else.
1,dull and repetitive,"I read a favorable review of this in my paper, but really, they must have read some other book! I couldn't follow the characters - and didn't really want to after a while - and couldn't finish the book. It's like a rehash of everything you've ever heard or read about arranged marriages, unhappy women, demanding males, etc, without any spark or originality."
3,The question of Alexandra's settled,"In a previous DS book (Dark Shadows Companion: 25th Anniversary Collection) conflicting ages for Dark Shadows beauty Alexandra Moltke are given. One page of that book says she was born in 1945 and then it goes on to say how she was 19 (!) in 1966! I wondered for a long time how old the beauty honestly was. This new book seemingly answers my question as there are a couple of pages in the book that are Alexandra's own words and she claims she was 19 on Dark Shadows, which premiered in June 1966, so I guess that makes the beauty born in 1946 (or 1947) and not in 1945, as the old DS book said. If I got nothing else out of this book I at least got the satisfaction of learning Alexandra Moltke's true age.PS I trust this book on her age over the old one because, again, we have her testimony on how old she is and the part in the old book on her age was written by someone else!"
5,First hand,"This is just one of the best books I've ever read on Dark Shadows. Kathryn writes brilliantly on her time in the show, describing the marvellously. Reading the various anecdotes made me wish I was there when the show was originally broadcast and there were a lot of stories I'd never heard. A great shame it has never been shown properly in the U.K. - thank goodness I've got the videos! Well recommended for anyone who loves Dark Shadows or fans of cult tv-programmes who are curious about this series."
3,Sadly never mentioned fact,"Beautiful Alexandra Moltke (who played Vicki Winters on DS) is 15th to 20th cousins with former German Chief of staff Helmuth von Moltke. Helmuth was Chief back in World War One. Dark Shadows Memories neglects to mention this fact about beautiful Alexandra. Also, this books makes other mistakes, including not mentioning Josette Collins' original maiden last name: La Freniere!"
2,Not worth the money,"I have come to the conclusion that Ken Burnscannot make a documentary over 2 hours long.He is repetitious and ona soap box throughout this documentary. There are somewonderful moments, but the east coast bias and the socialcommentary get old very quick. How many times, I groanedat the screen, ""not again""...I get it Ken, I get it...showme some baseball already. It is very apparent thatthis documentary was made to be watched over the course of2 1/2 months...it is unwatchable back to back. Pick any onedisk and it is very enjoyable, but then put it away for a whilebefore you watch another one. dissapointing."
5,A Home Run For Burns,"Ken Burns makes films very well, which is no secret. I think I caught them all at one time or another on television.When I heard he was making one for baseball I was very excited and could not wait to see it.And I was not dissapointed when I did see it, wonderful work about baseball from its earliest roots. Even my non-baseball fan friends enjoyed it.If you are a baseball fan, it is a must to see. Though the set is a bit expensive, it is also worth owning if you are a baseball fan or a Burns fan."
5,Ken Burns strikes gold,"Wow! This is eighteen hours of the most comprehensive baseball coverage i could ever conceive of. Burns does a great job spreading around his focus, using footage and narration to expertly cover the nuts and bolts of the game for past 150 yrs, which includes crucial historical events, games and player bios. He then has famous writers and historians reflect on the game, giving it the sentimentality that no other sport can match. My only caveat is that if you're not an avid baseball fan, it can drag on at parts. However, if you're a baseball nut (like me) or a historian, this is a MUST-HAVE. Worth every penny."
4,Please give your review a title.,"Great documentary, not Ken Burns' best, but essential viewing for any baseball fan. Very poor audio mix however, found myself straining repeatedly to hear the narration over whatever music was playing."
1,another Ken Burns bloated waste of space,I don't understand why this filmaker gets so much pub....if you don't mind looking at a still photo being photographed from 4 different angles instead of seeing actual footage buy this and try to sit through it all. It seems as if he doesn't want to pay to license more of the archival footage that is available and mixes in far too many talking heads and still shots.If you want to see footage of the greats of the game buy the MLB All Century Team DVD which has 2+ hours of fabulous video and some cool interviews plus stats.
3,Enjoy it. I wish I could.,"If your DVD player is made by RCA . . . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!I thought I received a defective set when I noticed gaps while watching. Then I noticed that the gaps always occurred when the PBS logo was displayed in the corner of the screen. Whole chunks of the documentary would be skipped whenever the logo appeared.Then I visited the PBS site and saw the warning that these DVDs may not be compatible with RCA players. If you don't have an RCA DVD player, I recommend this set wholeheartedly. There's a lot left out in the telling of the story of baseball, but there are so many wonderful stories and characters in its history that some things had to be left out.Enjoy it. I wish I could."
5,Awesome!,This series is amazing. A must have for any baseball fan or any one who appreciates rich history and masterful story telling. shipping was so fast also would definitely buy from seller again.
5,A must for baseball lovers,"This is simply an excellent historical DVD series. It's even better with the 10th inning added. I got this for my son, a Little League coach, hoping it will give him and his son a feel for the importance of baseball in the American scene."
3,Helps prepare you for going under the knife,"This book was one of several I read when making the decision of what to do about my aging face. It made me realize there had to be a less risky, invasive way to create a more youthful look. After meeting with several plastic surgeons and reading this book, I decided to try facial exercise first. I purchased several books-read them all-and found Facercise. The Facercise book and video tapes have given me the face I had 10 years ago. No surgery, no risks, no pain."
4,A Good Offering,"The style of this album differed greatedly from Raise the Pressure; indeed the loss of Neal Tennant from the group is sorely felt on this album. It is, however, catchy and grows on you and worth having and listening to. It surpasses their final CD, Twisted Tenderness. If you liked Raise the Pressure, definitely buy this CD, it's a good addition to your collection"
1,Skip It--Buy Twisted Tenderness,"Everything that was exciting about the first album is absent here. It's hook-free, Marr is MIA, and it's just, well, bland.Fortunately, the third--Twisted Tenderness--has Marr all over it, although it's a bit considerably more ""rock"" than the first disc.This is not even worth owning."
5,"dance to the beat, shuffle my feet...","Trevor Jackson's ""Party Mix"" is certainly the best argument for the Eighties this listener has yet to hear. Over two hundred classics from 1979-90 are strung together in a logical, occasionally witty mash-up. Each track is given about sixteen seconds. The disc is marked ""promo-only"". If you see it, snatch it up.Here are a few that I could remember:""Was Dog A Doughnut"", ""Change Beat"", ""Atomic Dog"", ""Soul Makossa""""Erotic City"", ""If I Was Your Girlfriend"", ""Genius of Love""""I Wonder If I Take You Home"", ""The Breaks"", ""Billie Jean""""The Message"", ""Boogie Down Bronx"",""Galaxy"",""Pull Up to the Bumper"", ""Problemz D'Amour"", ""Shari Vari"",""Blue Monday"", ""It's My Thing"", ""Adventures on the Wheels of Steel"",""Good Times"", ""Rapture"", ""Computer Games"",""Magic's Wand"", ""The Breaks"""
3,Feminist Supernatural Fiction from the 1850s to the Present,"Salmonson selects twenty-four supernatural stories written by women over the past 150 years. Many of these selections focus on a woman protagonist who, contrary to stereotype, keeps her head when confronted with fantastic sightings and happenings. For instance, in Lady Eleanor Smith's 1932 tale ""Tamar,"" pits a gypsy woman against the devil himself. The more recent ""A Friend in Need"" addresses the issues of child abuse and the support women can offer other women without becoming pedagogical. Instead, the issues are woven into a tale of what seems to be an imaginary childhood friendship.""What Did Miss Darrington See?"" should be read by all connoisseurs of supernatural and science fiction as well as by anyone researching feminist literature."
1,Not So Much,Bits and pieces of the movie were good.. I like the Day 5 part of the movie ...but that was about it. Had very good actors in it so I thought it would have been much better.. but NOT SO MUCH!. I would not waste my money on it unless it was about .99 cause I truly wasted my money on this one. Too much of using the F word at some parts especially when they were all at the table... Just a bit much!.. but that is just my opinion.
5,Good movie,Movie was very good. I didn't know what to expect with this movie but I was overly surprised on how good the movie was.
4,good movie,This movie reminds me of some of my relatives and acquaintances...always coming together for funerals or money but don't have enough time to socialize otherwise.
2,Formulaic,"Predictable and formulaic. Not a very interesting script accompanied by acting and directing that is simply average. I view this as ""C"" level movie making. As long as you don't expect much, you can find moments where it is mildly entertaining."
3,Um.....,"I liked the plot of the movie, however some of the actors overdid it. I watched the entire film out of curiousity, however, it really wasn't worth it. Not exactly sure why I expected more, but I did."
4,Better than I thought,I was impressed with the production. It is an entertaining movie and I would recommend. I am not a TO fan but he did well in the movie.
3,Trill It Review,"I knew the musician who did this and his name is nowhere to be found on the DVD or cover. His name is Stanley D. Hoffman, why isn't he given credit? He conceived the idea, wrote the music and did some of the vocal and arrangement. Also, I distinctly remember that ""Winchester Cathedral"" was on the original, but it's not on this remastered DVD. Am disappointed that my dear long-ago does not even get a mention -- except for his picture on the cover (and also his dog!)."
2,not even close,"Not funny. Not even close to the other Asterix books.That's what my 9-year-old boy said, when I brought this book from the library. He loves Asterix books, and rereads them many times. But he didn't even finish this one the first time through.Luckily it cost us nothing :)"
2,This book is very difficult to learn from for the first time,"I had heard that this book would be difficult, but I wasn't prepared for Cohn's strange treatment of such important concepts as integral domains, modules, and ideals. He is pretty thorough, but I would have prefered a more structured development of the subject. All in all, the book was decent, but not something for a first-time learner of the subject to look to for guidance."
2,Disappointing,These are more of an accent light than task lights...not what I expected. should have paid attention to other reviews.
1,"Large Bitches Britches (Red, Fits 21-75 lb. dog)","I only gave this product one star for the following reasons: the ""large"" size did not fit my 6-month old boxer puppy because the leg holes were too small and the tail hole was improperly placed; they charged for shipping to me and when I returned it to them; and the texture of the fabric is not conducive to pets."
4,A Yolk of Magic,"A great book with a great storyline, something you can get stuck into and have a good laugh about, but it still retains the basic storyline and doesn't deviate from it. It managed to continue the first story(To Demons Bound) really well and I only have two complaints. 1. The writers, in the second chapter of this story, repeated the second last chapter of the last story which got a touch boring. 2.Sometimes, in this book, the speech style of Davin changes, and I'm wondering if that's on purpose(high style because he's of the nobility) or if that's just a place where the writers' styles haven't mingled well.Other than those two points I thought the book was great and would recommend it to anyone who wants to try a light hearted sci-fi fantasy novel."
1,Don't Bother,I am a major Bruce Springsteen fan and have seen him many times including 5 other countries beside England.Not even I however can get exited about this tape. It's nothing but boring old storys without any decent footage.Take it from me don't waste any of your money on this one.Its an insult to your intelligence by somebody trying to make a quick buck at the expense of Bruce and the Band.
2,11B,"Hello, Everybody.I have used this rangefinder during my predeployment training and during my deployment to Afghanistan. Probably it good for golf when you operate on 100-200 m distances, but if you look for reliable device for the long range rifle engagement I would not recommend this rangefinder. The manufacturer claims that this model is capable to give you exact distance on the ranges up to 1500 meters. (That why model calls 1500) This is not true. Not in my experience. The device is accurate up to 400-500 m, not more if you measure man size target or a deer. Up to 800-900 (very difficult) if you measure big ass building or another large object. There is no way it can reach 1500. Not in my experience, anyway. Thank you"
5,Masters of Horror: The Black Cat,"With great production values, acting and direction, this is a must-see for fans of horror and Poe! And the commentary should be required study for anyone producing a DVD and planning to add a commentary track as an example of the correct way of matching entertaining banter and information about the feature. Simply a gem!"
2,Skimpy!,"All right, so LI'L ABNER wasn't a classic gem of a musical with a brilliant score. But it's not a BAD score. It's certainly got more to offer than this cheesy, five-song folio would indicate. Some of Johnny Mercer's lyrics, such as ""The Country's in the Very Best of Hands,"" are brilliant, and Gene de Paul's music is adequate. But is this song included? No. Only a couple of ballads and, surprisingly, ""Jubilation T. Cornpone."" I guess the publisher didn't think anyone cared about the other songs. Thankfully Sony/Columbia has seen fit to reissue the Original Cast album, with extras. THEY had faith! This is hardly worth the cost."
4,Pretty darn good.,"Contrary to what Michael K thinks, I know this album was released this side of the Atlantic. My roommate had it years ago ('96-'97), and I listened to it continuously before it was too scratched to bother with anymore. And while it did have mostly good songs, there where a couple I wasn't fond of, but that isn't unusual with me. All in all though, it was a good album, and that's why I'm buying it now, since I finally found it."
4,beautiful movie,This is one of those movies where you really get to see the process of filmaking. The end results are great. The only reason i took out a star is because of my high expectations going into the film after seeing dogville. The inclusion of the perfect human makes it worth the buy though.
5,What a wonderfully crafted story,"I wish this book had existed a lot sooner, as my eyes have been opened to Saxon England! Octavia Randolph's detailed account of life at this time has proven to be a tremendous learning experience. So much so, that I felt I was actually right there beside Ceridwen at times, in the great hall of Kilton, or spiralling in dance about the base of the fire surrounding the withy-work man on High Summer's Day, or locked in fierce combat against the Danish Vikings. I cannot begin to describe the imagery this story left in my mind. This book is an essential addition for anyone's library! If you have not had enough with Ceridwen of Kilton, then you should seek out another of Octavia Randolph's desirable works- The Circle of Ceridwen."

5,THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST ONES EVER,I AM A HUGE TRAVIS TRITT FAN. THIS CD IS THE GREASTEST THING. I JUST LOVE IT WHEN HE DECIDED TO THIS ONE HE WAS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW GREAT IT WAS. WHEN TRAVIS PUTS OUT NEW RELEASES IT ALWAYS AMAZES ME THAT HE SEEMS TO TOP THE PREVIUOS ONE. I DO NOT NOW HOW HE DEOS IT BUT I'M SO GLAD THAT HE CAN BECAUSE I JUST LOVE HIM SO MUCH.
2,travis tritt cd review,"I received the cd in a very timely manner, however sveral songs on the cd skip."
3,a couple of excellent songs on here,"there is a song on here called ""foolish pride"", this song is so sad it made me cry. My friend and her boyfriend broke up and she cried a lot also. If you need a good cry listen to this cd. There is a few other good songs on here also."
2,Scott is an Indicted Fraud,"Poor bear! This man lead an 11 yr old golden retriever (if he was a true SAR dog, should have been retired by then) to ground zero. Scott as well as Bear was not a rescuer, Scott is not a Captain of anything other then his own private boat. He admitted to his fraud charges in March and should be sentenced shortly. Rescue workers during Katrina and WTC did not have time for photos and utube videos. They were there busy saving lives. Shame on you Scott!"
3,What is all the Fuss ?,"I bought this album after reading a couple of great reviews from very good sources. I don't understand what all the fuss is over this release. While I really like a couple of tracks, there are some very weak one's as well. At the start I'm really in to this album and by the end I'm completely unsatisfied. The album is very flat and the deep vocals are weak at times. The music is played very well and there are some catchy guitar riffs, but the breaks suck. The lyrics on the breaks kill some of the songs for me, but the lyrical content on the album as a whole is great. There are some great story lines and you can tell there is a lot of thought put into the lyrics. I think there's a lot of potential for this group and they may put it all together on the next release. This is an uneven album that just doesn't do it for me. 3 stars for the original lyrical content and a couple of good tracks."
5,a must read,"marc is a great student of history, economic history, and markets. he presents a clear, concise, persuasive argument that the best investment opportunities over the next decade are not in north america. it is a must read for investors in a country with excessive levels of debt, low relative competitive advantage, no industrial production growth, and a still highly valued stock market. sadly, most of the country is in denial."
3,Two Novellas by Martha Grimes,"Anyone looking for light reading won't find it in these two novellas about lonely middle-aged women. The first, The Train Now Departing, was slow-going and monotonous. The second, When the Mousetrap Closes, moved along better, but is another sad tale. Don't read these novellas if you need cheering up; read her Richard Jury books instead."
4,90s Bring Back,This cd will appeal to 90s lovers.Well 90s pop lovers.You get some well known artist with some of their lesser herd songs wich is a nice change.This cd offers The Rembrandts song that always greets you to a funloving episode of FRIENDS.Alot of people are stumped by who made this song.It's very catchy and you can own it now.I love it.This cd also has big 90s stars such as:Hootie & The BlowfishBare Naked Ladies and Paul Westerburg.R.E.M is here with all their alternative glory.Alot of the songs arent that great to start off with and why do they go with the t.v. siries FRIENDS?I have no clue.If you want a bring back to the 90s some decent pop and one hell of a catchy intro well buy this and all Thirteen tracks are FRIENDS worthy.
2,Not Too Good,"I didn't really like the CD because I'm not into the type of music that is on it. The only songs I like are the intros...ya knnow the ""I'll be ther for you"" by the rembrants."
4,Not a bad TV soundtrack,"I'm a huge Friends fan, and, in a fit of nostalgia for the end of the show, I picked up this CD.The music and dialogue snippets are all from the first season. Some of the music on Friends that I really associate with the show (especially those involving the big Ross & Rachel moments) therefore aren't included. I don't remember, frankly, when some of these songs WERE played - and I know the show pretty well - but they are all good.I do most of my music listening on my mp3 player during workouts these days, and there are plenty of upbeat songs that I enjoy for that.One gripe - the dialogue bits are not separate tracks. So, when I did copy some of the music to my mp3 player, I get not only the song, but the dialogue at the end, which is slightly annoying.If you're a Friends fan, you'll probably enjoy the CD, but just read the playlist before you buy it if you're expecting the later music."
5,Nice Job On Covers,"Say what you want about her, but the girl can sing. Does a great job on ""Respect"" and almost as well on ""Natural Woman."" I didn't buy this for her hit single, but for these 2 covers, and it was worth it. Often, covers are vastly inferior, but she tears it up on ""Respect."""
4,Insightful!,"Valerie P. Hans has written a thorough, carefully designed study of jury behavior in civil trials. While presenting information cautiously and academically, she thoroughly explodes several common myths about civil juries and makes a powerful (if understated) case for the preservation of the civil jury system. She begins with surveys and quotes, preferring to let her data speak for itself, until she draws final conclusions and points out areas for further scholarship. Hans does not over-generalize, but the book is often repetitive, in part because some of the studies and issues overlap. Even so, the information is trimmed to a manageable length. This is not an entertaining read, but we [...] find the information and interviews clear, useful and accessible. This is a particularly helpful book for law students and professors, litigators, reporters covering the courts, corporate legal departments and anyone involved in civil litigation, especially if you have a voice in selecting a jury."
5,An eclectic tour-de-force,"A friend played the first disc of this album for me a few weeks ago and I had to go out and get it. I wasn't expecting that the second disc would be even better. In some ways, it reminds me of Neil Young using both electric and acoustic music to best serve the individual song. And you can tell that Taylor follows his own path - the songs are intelligent and quirky in the best sense of the word. This deserves better than to become an undiscovered gem."
2,Shore Synthesized...Again,"This CD follows hard upon the release of a similar work by the Hollywood Studio Orchestra & Singers. Both CDs share two things in common: they are both performances of Howard Shore's score to ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" and they are both realized on synthesizers. Not terribly exciting. But if you feel you have to subject yourself to one of these CDs, I'd suggest the Hollywood Studio version. At least they use real human voices for the choral parts. The present CD doesn't even do that :("
1,EXPENSIVE AND BREAK EASILY,These headphones broke after 2 months. Ridiculous price for a two month investment. [...]
2,Oh Courtney!,"Ok, I realize this is very old, outdated, and Koontz' first major publication. It was a quick and easy read, and very predictable yet still enjoyable enough. I am currently on a mission to read all of Koontz' works. I just read Demon Seed,and now Shattered. I am reading them all in order. Although I should have saved Demon Seed for when it was updated. Which is why I am leaving Winter Moon and Icebound for their revised dates and moving on to Night Chills next."
3,Alex and Colin are being followed by a mad man.,"Alex and Colin are on their way to meet up with Courtney, Alex's wife and Colin's sister, to make their new lives. While they are driving there they are being followed be a man that they have no idea who it is. They have no idea why he would want them."
3,A Koontz disapointment,This book seems just as another cat and mouse novel.Ther is not really any character depth or anything of that sort.It just follow the leader and then kill him!The ending is unfufilling and leaves you unsatisfied
1,AFTER I READ THIS I FELT.....SHATTERED.,"I have enjoyed DK's books in the past but this one fizzles. The characters are dull. Theres no character that you can really connect with.the only simi likable character is colin. There's one scene with only meager suspense and the rest is basically a cat and mouse game full of bad dialouge and laughable thoughts. Leave this one on the shelf, if you want a good DK novel check out Intensity or Dragon Tears."
2,"Short, but not especially sweet","I read this from one of his 3-novel collections, and it's one of the weakest Koontz novels I've read. The villain was rather weak, with only a few of his qualities being interesting. His intentions and motives are standard cookie-cutter. Some tension is built with sudden mentions of his van. There is not enough fleshing-out of the ""hero"", and the ending feels abrupt and not worth the trouble, while also being a little predictable. It's only a hundred pages, so it only took me a couple hours to hammer out. The main cop that was mentioned was a waste, with no conclusion for him written. The ""encounters"" the hero has with ""discrimanatory"" people along the way are annoying and cliched. Still, it was fun to follow their cross-country pursuit on my road atlas.Probably just for Koontz fans, and I firmly count myself as one."
1,Oregon Scientific WR602,Purchased the Oregon Radio based on the product name and reading reviews. The radio I received played static 100% of the time. I tried various operating modes like putting it near a window but the static was relentless. The programming mode always came up in French ???? I could not remedy this action. I could not recommend this product.
2,"Easy to use, but not very functional...","The instructions were very easy to read/understand/setup. I had no trouble getting all the settings made, but the radio will not receive a signal anywhere in my home or yard. I emailed the company for any suggestions and they never replied. I do not reccomend this product."
3,Not what I expected,"Although it shipped quickly, I did not like the quality of this box. Also, now that all the fashion watches for women are so large, my watches would not fit into the slots. Made more for the small faced watches. Kind of flimsy too. Vendor was very courteous, simplified my return without a hassle."
3,For really short people,"This bodystocking was not what i was expecting. Its really small, and I'm only 5'8"". I usually buy items with more than one review but it fell in my price range. The torso looks like it would be for a child and the side holes in the picture didn't go farther then above my knee. The material was decent though. I pulled on it a bit to try to stretch it and no tears or runs. Very soft material as well. If it came in a larger size and was still reasonably priced, I would probably buy it again."
5,Perfect! So Exciting! Just what the Maldives needed.,"The most incredible underwater photos yet to be seen of the Maldives; combined with the best dive spots and detailed descriptions. First fully detailed, reliable and accurate maps of all the Islands, a Great book that is a must to any Maldives traveller or scuba enthusiast."
2,A Treatise on Carriage,A bit disappointed that this condensed version of the original book didn't offer nearly enough information to be worthwhile. The service I got when I ordered it was very good. But the small book leaves a lot to be desired.
5,Top notch for general viewing,"Used for general viewing, camping, trekking, etc. Not meant for seeing 10 miles away, but great for general use. Comes in a nice case too."
4,Essential Start-Up Book,"In this book, Jack has set out very relevant guide posts for people who are involved in start-ups. His writing is absolutely ""no-nonsense"" and this book can be used as a recommended text in any business course.My favourite bits:I feel that Chapter 10 (Managing Projects) was very well-presented and clear. Another must-read is Chapter 13 (Reading the Market) where Jack actually brings in Economics concepts - this is a refreshing change and reinforces in relevance of Economics as an analytical tool.Jack also includes updated links of relevant sites to research.I believe that different portions of the book will benefit people at different stages of business development. This book is a must-buy purely because it does not romanticise entrepreneurship but genuinely wants the reader to succeed..."
4,"Amazon, some help here!!!","DVD's can be great, or garbage. Evidently there's a DVD of Raid on Entebbe that is garbage. But which?? Reviews were easier and more helpful when there was one DVD of one movie. But once again, now that there is a 2007 re-release of Raid on Entebbe, which reviews belong to which DVD? In particular, have the transfer problems that plague MANY DVDs been cleaned up in the new release? Somehow, Amazon has GOT to make sure that the reviews for one DVD are not attached to another. If you agree, please click this. Maybe if enough people ask for it, Amazon will clean up its act."
3,RAID ON ENTEBBE,"WRITTEN TO RELATE FACTS OF THE INCIDENT AND THEREFORE LACKS SOME OF THE SMOOTH TRANSITIONS NORMALLY SEEN IN THIS TYPE OF MOVIE. BEING MADE FOR TV ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS FAULT. STILL, A GOOD MOVIE FOR WHAT IT IS."
1,DocIt 13 pocket expanding file,"I have been using this product for several years and have clear files so you can see what is in the first and last pocket. Now that I need more all I have seen are 4 colors, red, blue, green, and yellow. Had I known there were brown ones, I wouldn't have ordered, because I don't want brown on my shelves and now I have 2 brown ones.. Petty, I know, but colors is important to me. I am disappointed. Since there were only 2 available, why didn't the ad say they were brown instead of saying the color may vary?"
5,WORTH THE MONEY,I read alot of reviews and did a lot of research on all the different types of range finders out there.This one got the best reviews by far so i bought it.It is very simple to use just point and push the button it is really that simple. My friends who are all very good golfers 5 handicap and under say it very acurate.Now that I have something to help me find the correct yardage. I am on the search for clubs that will help me hit the ball the correct yardage any suggestions? BUY IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED
4,Bushneel Rangefinder,It does what it says it should - surprisingly good at spotting golf flags but you still need a steady hand and a good eye. Good golfing.
4,Bushnell Pinseeker 1500,"Easy to use. Clear optics. Ranges very well up to 1000 yards, but not much further."
2,Delay...,"The unit DOES work... it does convert the digital coaxial audio signal into a digital optical signal.BUT... and it is a BIG BUT, there is a delay that can not be adjusted causing the audio to trail the video ""ever so slightly"".I can adjust my home theater to compensate the OTHER way, but can not time travel to fix this.I tried all evening to ""deal with it""... but I can tell it will drive me mad eventually.I am borrowing a friends ""to analog"" converter to see if it is any different.Be warned..."
3,Doesn't work on everything,"I bought this to use with either my DVD player or an HDTV antenna.Neither worked with it. I plugged it into my Onyko 7.1 stereo and it cut out the audio a lot with HDTV antenna and on the DVD never once gave me audio. Funny thing is, on my buddy's older Sony 5.1 stereo system it works. May not work on some receivers."
2,Warning: Do not buy HP iPAQ pda,"The pda is very nice, portable, and has good features. If you decide to get this or any HP iPAQ pda, you MUST add at least an additional $165 to you budget to fix the screen as it will crack soon or later without a doubt. Steer clear. This PDA is NOT recommended at all."
4,good for beginners,"This is a good book for a beginner, which I am. It was the second book on the subject that I have gotten. Some of it confused me, because I didn't know all the vocabulary, but on the whole it was very informative. Good for someone who doesn't know much about it, which I don't."
4,Excellent Yes CD - BUT BEWARE IF YOU ARE THINKING YOU ARE ORDERING THE JAPANESE REMASTERED VERSION,"My review is not to critique this particular Yes CD. It's an excellent choice. HOWEVER, I purchased this particular item on this page thinking I was buying the Japanese remastered edition, as the Amazon description says. There is a Japanese Remastered edition, HDCD by the way. That was the one I thought I had found. Upon receiving, it is the AMERICAN Remastered CD with a Japanese obi strip and addtional plastic folder enwrapping it. So if you are looking for the Japanese Remastered edition, look elsewhere. Amazon needs to make a correction or clarification here. Even the Amazon Japan site, which I looked at after I received the disc, says this is the American version."
4,SON VOLT BATTERY,"Alt-country atmospherics that sound like the musical forces between two lines of lonely but active telephone wires along a deserted Texas highway. Jay Farrar's (Uncle Tupelo) rich rambling voice sounds both virgin and whiskey-throated and when he sings ""catching an all night station, somewhere in Louisiana, sounds like 1963, but for now it sounds like heaven."", the listener is right there with him cruising down a starry twilight highway onto the next time zone. ""Trace"" reminds me of The Eagles first record without the big city polish with equal parts acoustic country soul and flat out Southern rockers, neither form vying for prominence but blending effortlessly into a solid alt-music perfection."
4,Good simple explanations,Overall a good beginners guide to Hydraulic Suspension. Despite its name it is not by any means a scientific explanation of anything. What it does do is help a beginner understands what s/he would need to do in order to install hydraulics on his/her car.
5,If you like Mr. Bill (or the Pizza Head commercials) get it!,"This Mr. Bill video is very funny I believe. And what makes it so great, of course, is how ""cheap"" it's done. No one but Mr. Hands ever moves, and Mr. Bill just has to ""stand"" for anything Mr. Hands does to him, or anything Sluggo, a guy who hates Mr. Bill, tells Mr. Hands to do to him. Hilarious I believe!"
2,Lamott fans beware,"For the legions of Anne Lamott fans out there (I'm one of them), this is the novel to avoid. It is a maddeningly self-conscious attempt at serious fiction. At times I felt like I was sitting through the first draft of a talented but misguided novelist. Lamott (and her editors) should trust her brilliant wit and insight and leave serious novels to others. Like Woody Allen,another brilliant comic, Anne Lamott seems to occasionally want to prove that she can be taken seriously. This book, while funny at times, reminded me of Allen's attempts at serious, Bergman-like films. The viewer (and in Lamott's case, reader) is left feeling almost betrayed by the about-face."
4,She expresses life through her books.,"When I read this book I was left feeling so much clearer on my own childhood and teenage years. Anne Lammot continues to shine, I am a very big fan of her writing, both fiction and non-fiction."
4,Foundry 1,"I have the original gatefold Foundry 1 vinyl, if anyone's interested. It's in g condition on the side of the lp with flight on it (there are about 3 brief pops in one section). The other 3 sides are nm-m, as they have only been played a few times (like 2). The gatefold is in nm-m as it has always been bagged since I bought it in the 1980's.The review: it's all good and far better than his first disc. Nothing beats ""Flight""."
5,Easy to use music stand,This is a good quality music stand. I like the extra supports at the top that keep single sheets of music from bending over. Stands easily folds and fits into it's carrying bag.
5,Buy This Book,"While some of the language is a bit 'vintage' or a bit hippy, there is no other published work that will do what this will: give you every piece of information required to build a house. He did heat loss calcs before it was hip. If you are designing and or building a house you need this book. I wore one out and bought another"
4,"Soft fabric, launders well","This is extremely soft for baby's skin, yet repels stains and washes very well (keeping that softness). We were so pleased with this product, we purchased another so that we'd always have a clean one ready if the other required immediate laundering. The color has held up very well through (at least) one wash a week for 3 months. The only recommendations we have for the manufacturer are to put more fabric on the bottom to protect sensitive wood surfaces from the plastic of the changing pad and to add skid pads on the fabric to prevent the pad from easily sliding."
4,Super Soft!,"This changing pad cover is ridiculously soft! I had read that it was wonderful to the touch, but couldn't believe how wonderful it felt. I'm sure our twin daughters will love it. When my 8 year old was a baby, I'd used a terry cloth cover (can't recall the brand) and it actually seemed very scratchy and uncomfortable, so this one seems much nicer to me. It also fit perfect with our contoured changing pad (we also chose a Summer Infant changing pad, which works great and seems nice and firm and supportive). The wash and care for this cover is pretty basic, and the material seems durable. I'm not sure how clean the white will remain, but my 8 year old's cover was also white and it stayed white the entire time we used it, so I'm hoping that won't be an issue. However, the price was so nice, that even if we have to replace it down the line, I won't feel too bad."
5,It's very soft and it doesn't stain,"These things aren't totally well made, and will sometimes develop rips along where the elastic is, but they are incredibly soft, and never stain despite major poop blowouts from my infant. That is not true of say, a cotton terry cloth one I got from BRU. Prefer these."
4,Good Value,bought two of these. Best price around for a nice soft changing table cover. Very Good value for the cost.
3,not bad,until know am not using that becausae i need to have a materil in site of the cover so as neer as i will
5,Baby loves the soft feel.,"First I would have to say what a great seller. I ordered pink and for some reason I got blue, I emailed them and they promptly sent me out a pink one!My baby also loves to lay on her changing table and feel the softness of the cover, sometimes i just put her on there to let her feel it."
5,This book is truly a confirmation of spitirually in today's chaos !,"I no longer try to explain laws and rules of spirituality to family and friends, instead, I buy books that support theses ideas .I am going to buy several of these when I finish writing this review. I feel that each one of us has to take responsibility in saving our universe in spreading Light to this world and this book sheds a great Light!"
1,Sorry to Disappoint,"Sorry to disappoint new potential buyers for this item, but after agonizing for many days on whether to spend the $338 for the Pinseeker 1500, I took all the good reviews to heart and dialed in my ""Place Order."" Only then did I find out that there would be $40 added for shipping. After calling Beach Camera for clarification, I was told that they do not even have the 1500 in stock. Amazon, get your act in order!"
3,Works great watch out for battery door to fall off,"The battery door design on this unit blows. It fell off on the golf course.Now I have duct tape holding the battery in. I will be writing Bushnell for a replacement, we'll see what happens..."
5,Very Satisfied With This Product,"The Bushnell Yardage Pro Golf Pinseeker 1500 Laser Rangfinder is easy to use and very accurate. I really like the pin mode indicator that lets you know when you have a lock onto the pin without picking up trees or other objects in the background. It provides the yardage information very quickly and doesn't slow down play. Of course the Bushnell optics are second to none and the adjustable eyepiece is another handy feature.The only minor complaint I have is the case that comes with it. It's too bulky and awkward to handle and stow away. Don't know if it will make you a better golfer, but if you are in the market for a reliable, accurate rangefinder, I highly recommend the Bushnell Pro Golf Pinseeker 1500."
2,disappointed,"""Widely spaced outlets that accommodate up to four transformers"" Well, no. There are six outlets, in two rows of three, so you'd think you can plug one transformer into each of the corner outlets. But when you do that, there's not enough room: the edge on one side doesn't allow the plug to go all the way in.I had an older Tripplite that had room for actual transformers but this on can only fit two, firmly and solidly. I'm sorry I bought this unit."
2,This Their Greatest Hits........Not!!!,"This is a very poorly put together package. The only way to do this band Justice is a 5 or 6 disc retrospective. There are too many glaring omissions from this--like Turn of The Century, Awaken, Close to The Edge, Going for the One---instead they opt to put crap songs like Big Generator, Shoot High Aim Low..and other Rabin era nonsence on this...sad indeed. Their Box sets even though not complete are better than this mess. Stay Far away from this one...Its just a cheap attempt to make money.. TRUE yes fans deserve much better....."
3,It's Okay,"Purity is just okay. I have all their other disks, and I still can't get enough of them. When I pop Purity into the player, I find my mind wandering away from the music, occasionally brought back to reality by an overly repetitive melody or wailing that lasts too long. Previous disks are amazing, but this one is pedantic, boring, and lackluster. Sorry, Mythos, better luck next time. Mythos, Reality of a Dreamer, and Eternity disks are fantastic. Purity is very disappointing."
3,Great Wireless Mouse !!!,Works amazing with my HP Bluetooth enabled laptop with Windows Vista Home Premium. This product is really good.
5,Bluetooth Mouse is great,I use this mouse with my Dell laptop that is Bluetooth capable. The mouse was recognized right out of the box and has now gone for four weeks on the same AA battery. I am greatly pleased.
2,"software buggy, crashes XP","My wife experienced months of intermittent blue screen crashes after installing the mouse's accompanying Logitech SetPoint version 4.24 software on a Lenovo T60 laptop running Windows XP SP3. I kept the machine fully updated via ThinkVantage and Windows Update; swept for spyware, defragged, etc., but sporadic crashes continued, for example, when coming out of Standby. She was able to tolerate this until XP began crashing with blue screens every 21 minutes! The fix was to deinstall SetPoint, and to revert to a wired mouse. No more crashes. Outside of the deal-breaker Logitech software, we liked the mouse; ergonomics, tracking, and battery life were fine. If you search the online support forums, you'll find many other users complaining of serious problems using SetPoint, and an apparent lack of responsiveness from Logitech."
1,This mouse does not work consistantly with OSX,"The mouse worked for a little while, but then the OS keptdropping the bluetooth connection and now I can neverget it to work. Right now it is sitting uselessly on my desk."
4,It works nicely,"I some times takes a second to start going(that is why I give it 4 stars), but is not really that annoying. I haven't changed the batteries since I got it (2 months), an I constantly forget to turn it off.In General I like it very much for my laptop."
4,"Pairs easily, weighted well","I tried several other Bluetooth mice and found this one to be the best. It pairs easily and is weighted well, not too lite like some of the others I tried."
3,Great - it's bluetooth,Somehow in the descripotion we missed that it bluetooth enabled and therefore we can't use it.
4,Perfect mouse for the business traveler,This mouse is perfect for traveling. I would give it a 4... It's a little small and It's not perfect for ergonomics but everything else is great. Bluetooth is built into my laptop so no extra usb devices are needed. It's a great companion for the traveler.
5,"it's great, long lasting batts","it's compact and easy to configure, works great.the best purchase ever!"
5,Works great for business travel,"I purchased this mouse to work with my Dell Precision M4300 laptop. Setup was easy and took about 3 mintues.The mouse works great, especially on slick and shiney surfaces. I use the mouse primarily at hotels and many mice don't track on faux surfaces the hotel desks are made of. This mouse works without a problem on the 4 desks I tried so far - much better than the rest. Another great product from Logitech."
4,Nintendo Is Fun Again,"I bought this game because wii sports was getting old, and I was really excited to hear about the movement controls. I was a huge DBZ Enthusiast back in the day, and everything I ever wanted in a DBZ Game is here. I wish this technology was avaliable when I was younger! The game is fun, not too overly challenging, but difficult enough to keep it interesting. I have not beat it yet, but with over 100 playable characters, I see my purchase of 19.99 lasting longer than anything else I would spend that money on. The graphics are nice, I don't own an HD system, so it looks superior to my xbox, and honestly, the gameplay is important. I love the movement scheme and once you pick it up, it's hard to put it down. Will I buy Tenkaichi 3? Probably not. 2 has everything I want and will be challenging me for a very long time."
4,for desktop,"I bought these to attach to my laptop and sit on my desktop, small size was important. The fractional watt headphone amplifier in the laptop is enough to push these to reasonable volume. A visit to radio shack and some quick soldering produced a cable. Not exactly hi-fi, but better than the 1 1/2 inch speakers in the laptop. The real use is listening to radio web streams while I work, and playback of my ripped CD collection."
5,Sony speakers,"I have purchased two sets of these speakers from the same company and have been very satisfied with the company and the product. I was looking for a set of small inexpensive bookshelf speakers and these more than fit the bill. Workmanship is very good and the sound quality is ample for what I wanted. For the price, I found these speakers to be a bargain."
5,Great for Morning Asanas,"I needed a simple video for my morning Asanas to go with the Ayurveda diet plan for my Dosha type and this one was perfect for me. Denise repeats each exercise so you can learn the move before going on to the next one. I hate trying to keep up with sprinting exercise teachers and Denise goes slow enough so even seniors can keep up with this one. I love it. My three year old now does the Morning Asana part with me every morning.I have flattened my ab, lost five pounds and feel much better health wise since using this one. I want to see results without a lot of sweat or grunt work! This is the one for me!The background of Mountain range and the landscape scenes are beautiful as well!"
1,Denise Austin VHS,Wrong VHS was sent with no receipt. Did not order XTRALite Beginner's Tone Up! I ordered XTRALite Beginners Yoga! Will not order again.
1,JUST TERRIBLE,"THE GAME IS GOD AWFUL. THE ARMIES ARE NOT AS BIG AS THE SEEM TO BE, AND WHEN THE UNITS RUN THEY ARE STUCK TOGETHER AND LOOK LIKE CRAP. THE GRPAHICS ARE BAD AND THEY PLAYING MODE IS BAD AND YOU WONT LIKE IT. THE LEVELS AREN'T INTERESTING AND IT TAKES TO LONG TO START THE BATTLE. THE AI IS TERRIBLE. SOMETIMES IF YOU TOLD THE TROOPS TO WALK STRAIGHT THEY WOULD WALK BACKWORDS. THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING"
1,Imperial glory,"I was not impress at all when playing this game. The disk is flimsy and made lots of noise when I put it in the drive. Overall, I am not happy with this purchase at all."
3,Overrated and drawn out,"Imperial Glory suffers from several things. First off, the strategy map is very simplistic and lacks the complexity of Rome: Total War's--even the diplomacy is plain with relatively few options. When it comes to the battles, they take place on pre-set landscapes that never change once one moves into a province and the lack of a pause option gives one the feeling that the battles quickly fall out of one's grasp. Add to that the fact that you only have a few troop types that are pretty much the same across countries, and you've got a game that quickly becomes a bore...."
4,More adventures of Frasier,"Huge fans of Cheers and Frasier were really into the latter sitcom as the 1995-96 season began,which was its third. Keep up the great character,Frasier!"
4,The Inner Glow,"""The Inner Glow"" is a book that provokes thought. It has many emotion, the funny, the serious, having faith and love. The story is about a little boy who can guide a family into being a little bit better. I would recommend the book to those who are seeking comfort from loss and to those who are looking for a little more to life."
5,Up there with Beethoven's 9th and Mozart's 40th,I am not kidding. This album is simply the greatest album of the last 50 years.
2,"First two songs rock, rest are awful","I'm a big Knopfler fan, and love his work with Dire Straits and his other solo album, Sailing To Philadelphia. This one starts strong with two rocking, upbeat songs with Mark's trademark guitar licks. But after that, every song sounds like the guy is on Prozac. I cannot recommend purchasing this album."
1,Another disappointment from Philip T. Tucker,"This book bears all the hallmarks of Tucker's other works: poor scholarship,weak editing, stilted prose, and contents that don't live up to the title - only 70 pages of this 250 page book even deal with Burnside's Bridge."
5,"funky, soothing spirituality","The first thing I noticed about this album was that it never gave me the chance to have a 2nd, 3rd or 4th time listen to see wheather I liked it or not, the 1st time was enough. With the religous sentiments identifing todays society like ""leviticus:faggot, the funky jazz to keep your head rocking alongside those sweet soft melow tunes like ""stay"" and ""free my heart"". Me'shell is an artist who has unique gift with the way she she uses her poetic voice, which transends through my Hi-Fi with feeling. I reccommend this album to anyone who appreciates good music. BUY IT."
4,Loved it!,"I haven't had the privilege and pleasure of seeing this artist in a live show, but I will definitely make the effort after listening to this CD! It is truly awesome!Buy this CD - you won't be disappointed!"
1,Disappointing!,"I have always been a huge fan of Anne Rivers Siddons. I have read most of her books and have always enjoyed her style of writing. She is so eloquent and has such a wonderful vocabulary,with which she brings to life her marvelous characters and locales.However I was quiet disappointed with Heartbreak Hotel.Her story line is tedious,overworked and her characters lack her usual depth.I was bored after the third chapter ,but plowed on through. Sorry to say I found it to be a waste of time."
3,Good flick but not as good as Trinity and beyond,"This was good background for the Trinity amd beyomd video, just a rehash of Trinity stuff but interesting historical documentary"
3,Adrenaline for the people,"Deftones'first album is not an easy listening job at all... This one is -like the title says- pure adrenaline. Aggression and anger. Furious screaming with sharp guitaring. There are hints of the Tones' greatness in these songs already, but ""Adrenaline"" gets nowhere near the two follow-ups ""Around The fur"" and ""White Pony"". If you are new to the band I recommend you check those out first.Not bad, but a bit too repetitive and some more melodies would get this one 4 stars..."
2,depends,"If you bought this c.d. in hopes of it sounding like shove it, sorry, the songs are all alike sounding and typical"
4,Deftones are not f**cking nu-metal,"Deftones were rockin their same f**ckin rock way before nu-metal was ever thought of. As soon as Korn and Incubus came around is when that s**t got started. Dont get me wrong I like the those aforementioned. Same with Anthrax. They did what Deftones do now and have done all along, and nu-metal was nonexistent. so stop with all this s**t about deftones being nu-metal. theyre just metal."
1,Complete waste of time,"I read a few of the reviews for this seller before buying this item and obviously took them too lightly. Clearly, whomever was responsible for packaging the map I ordered was far beyond incompetent. Rather than using a shipping tube or some type of box designed for shipping posters, this person hastily taped two boxes together and slapped the shipping label on the outside. My map arrived bent in the middle and damaged on both ends. It was almost more trouble to repackage the item and send it back than the $12 price tag warranted. At least the replacement item was in perfect condition, second time's a charm. The map is exactly what I wanted and has plastic poster hanger things along the top and bottom that slide off. Very nice. I wish the seller could have gotten it right the first time."
4,PRODUCT GREAT; DELIVERY CONDITION TERRIBLE,"I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT HOW THIS PRODUCT IS RECEIVED. I THOUGHT THAT WITH THE MANY POOR REVIEWS ABOUT SHIPPING THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT RIGHT BY NOW. NO, IT WAS A MESS, LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN RUN OVER BY A TANK. THE MAP IS BENT AND MAY NOT BE SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO HANG UP, I WON'T."
3,AmericanGunfight,"The authors spent too much time and paper detailing the early lives of these perpetrators.This was completely unneeded.I almost put the book down in the first 50 pages.The reason that I didn't was;...(1.)I paid for the book,...(2.)the primary author(Stephen Hunter)is one of my favorites,and third,I decided to be patient, find out eventually what really happened with the attempted assassination.Far too much detailed description(s) of the secret service agents,their personal lives,their families,etc.Mr.Hunter-Mr.Bainbridge would have been better off adhering to the details regarding the assassination attempt."
3,doesn't anyone edit books anymore?,"The subject matter is fascinating, but this book suffers from a wandering and haphazard writing style. Most of all, doesn't anyone edit books anymore? Throughout the narrative the authors repeatedly change tense in the middle of paragraphs, and even in the middle of sentences. If you have any journalistic background it will drive you nuts. What could have been a great story dissolves into a pile of mush. Any decent impartial editor would have cleared this up in a hurry, so perhaps the manuscript was edited by one of the authors... who knows?"
1,I should have read all the reviews,I really wanted to read about this incident - not what everyone in a 40 mile radius for a couple of years was wearing and what the temperature was when they were wearing it. Scream! Too many books to read to slog through this.
1,The 1st stupid thing you can do is read MS Pearl's book,I suppose values and common sense means nothing to this author. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
1,Waste of money !,"Do not waste your money on this book. If you searched for Dr. Laura, you would be better off to get one of her books. MS Pearl should read ""Ten Stupid Things Women Do To Mess Up There Lives"", because she's done them all. I believe the guilt from her messed up life is very well potrayed in this book. Dr. Laura hit a ""raw nerve"" called ""Mother's guilt"" and MS Pearl is retaliating. MS Pearl is a very bitter women."
1,Very Disappointed with this prodluct.,"This product did not live up to my expectations. After reading all of the raving reviews, purchasing and using the product, I realized that I was fooled. The product made my hair so brittle and tangled, my hair actually squeaked when I tried to comb the conditioner into my hair. My hair is usually very soft and manageable after shampooing and conditioning. My hair is not of the type that some hairdressers consider difficult to handle, they usually enjoy playing with my hair. My hair has even been used for student examinations. After becoming so angry, I decided to rinse out the conditioner and start again with my regular shampoo. I had much better results. I would not recommend this product to anyone. My experience with this product and the moisturizing shampoo was so disappointing that I am afraid to try the other Aphogee items that I purchased. I will most likely donate it to a charity."
5,Great Leave-in for Oily or Damaged Hair!,"Aphogee has done it yet, again! The Aphogee Pro-vitamin Leave-In is outstanding! Whether you have hair that is bleached, damaged or otherwise chemically treated, this is the leave-in for you. It is water-weightless and can be layered under heavier leave-ins if/as needed. Praise isn't enough to describe this product's virtues. But, hopefully an A++ will suffice.JJ/-R"
1,Very cheap,"The packaging is lovely, but doesn't do anything to protect the earrings in transit. One earring arrived more tightly wound than the picture, and one looser. Individually, they would have been fine, but as a pair they look silly. Very disappointed with the quality."
2,Yet again disappointed!,"First let me say that I like this film. It's beautiful with a intriguing story.With that out of the way let me again point out that Fox/Lorber has again put out a poor DVD edition of another film. The subtitles are on the film and very big. I guess I shouldn't complain as you can read them, unlike most of Fox/Lorber films.This is in Full Screen. I wish someone could explain to me how Fox/Lorber can call their movies widescreen with they are full frame? Someone should call them on this fact as they repeatedly call their movies widescreen that are obviously full screen.The video is decent as is the audio. All I can say is that it's watchable and doesn't take too much away from the original. But again it's just a poor transfer.Oh well...if you are like me and really want to see this film it is probably the only version that will come out. But if not...there are plenty of Criterion and Anchor Bay DVDs to mention a couple."
2,still no good case for zen,"to start, the leather case is not that bad, as long as youre in a clean environment. doesnt fully case the zen so dust and other debris easily get inside and onto the screen. also, the window on the leather case scratches and glares easily and i find myself taking it out to watch movies. the armband is worthless. it uses these circle velcro spots spread out along the outside to secure it. now, if u actually work out you wont be able to find a comfortable spot due to the fact that once you get it tight enough if your zen isn't on hold it will start squeezing the play or smart button. oh and if you decide to change songs dont touch anything but the button you want to use because any extra pressure will squeeze one or more buttons rendering your zen frozen until you free all the buttons.wish i could have gotten my money back."
1,not the actual charger...,this is a micro usb charger and this phone doesn't charge thru the usb... will return this product asap!! not happy with this!
1,not good,i have to anchor the charger with a tape on the phone in order to charge it. it didn't fit into the battery port. it turned on and off. it did not charge anymore after the first 2 tries. stay away from it.
5,Powerful!,"Only a man who has gone through significant spiritual tests could have written this book. His trials have given him a perception and degree of understanding that not everyone has attained. This book is Scripturally solid. On page 27 he writes, ""Humility is a frame of reference that perceives all of life as a gift from our sovereign and gracious God."" He goes on to describe brokeness as a process of pruning. He teaches us that in that process God cuts off the non-productive branches, enabling the desirable branches to grow stronger and more fruitful.He makes a powerful statement on page 34 when he says ""No one ever gets close to God without an overwhelming sense of impurity and frailty."" Attitude is a vital key in the overcoming time in the midst of difficulty. Dr. Nelson says if our attitude is right, the trials will make us stronger.I highly recommend this powerful book. The author is right on target. This book will help you to come out of your trials better than when you entered them."
2,Not worth the trouble.,"The fiber optics do catch alot of light, and they work great, but the snap mount they're on wiggles around on the barrel, twisting out of alignment."
2,Not what I expected.,"As a fan of Scott Cole's, from his Abs of Steel 2 video, I was eager to try this lower body workout tape. What a disappointment. While the workout itself is okay (a bit on the easy side)the quality of the video looks as if it were shot with a home movie camera. I also found the chatty banter between Scott and Billie to be excessive, and quite irritating after the first couple of viewings. The routine is quadricep heavy and completely leaves out hamstrings. They do touch briefly on calves. If you workout to your own music or with headphones then this video could be a good beginning tape for you, however I expected better."
2,Not as discribed,"This was a used book and a library addition, but it was in very used condition and had scribbles in it. I ordered this book to include with a Christmas gift for a needy child with a hand made tug boat. The book was too damaged to use for this. This is a great story for mid-west children to understand tug boat. The original story is located in an Eastern city harbor that these children would not relate to. Too bad this one is not being reproduced."
3,Mixed Emotions!,I was SO surprised at the size of this loop! I expected it to be twice the size it was. I didn't realize they were smaller than the ones that the jewelers use.
5,For George Benson the Tenor,"Granted, along with earl Klugh, and Wes Montgomery, George Benson is one of the finest Jazz Musicians to ever pick up a guitar.However, I love to hear his beautiful clear voice ring out full of emotion and tenderness. That's why I love this collection of George Benson Vocals. Sometimes you are in the mood for instrumentals, but sometimes you just want to sing along. Included in this collection is one of my personal favorites, the melancholy ballad, ""Everything Must Change"" from his album ""In Flight"". I always used to play it last when I would D J a dance back in the day, thinking every time this could be the last time I'd do this, have this much fun etc. And many of these songs have that kind of memories. It's hard to feel that way about an instrumental, no matter how good."
4,Solid book on Internal Auidting,This book is comprehensive but still concise. I have been in Auditing for a number of years and found it up-to-date and very helpful.
4,Decent live album.,"First off, the sound quality of this recording is great, not muddy like you find in a lot of live recordings. Each band member is clearly audible. 75% of the album consists of live versions of what I consider to be the best tracks off their debut album. Then there are two other songs--""What's the Matter Baby"" and ""Tunnel of Love."" Good live versions of all these songs, but they're essentially play just like they are on the studio versions (with the exception of ""What's the Matter Baby""...is there a studio version of that anywhere?). Nothing really special about them, just your run of the mill live album that happens to have exceptionally good sound quality. I will admit though that the version of ""Sultans of Swing"" on this recording is great, and Knopfler's guitar solo on it is amazing. I still like the ""Alchemy"" album better."
4,Great Costume,"this was a really great costume for my 11 year old Grandson. He said that the costume has a perfect fit, he even made a cardboard Buck 120 knife for it. i recommend this for any child that loves ""Scream""."
1,Faild in a week,The watch arrived in good condition in a reasonable length of time but failed to speak after aout 2 weeks. I have not recieved any respones from my email sent to the merchant.:-(
1,Terrible!,"If I could give this book 0 stars I would. I had high hopes for it because I do enjoy some of her other books. It basically is just a very poorly written book! It is her personal commentary on creation which is filled with many glaring biblical errors. She contradicts herself and her 'evidence' is very shoddy and at times, a bit ridiculous. I cannot recommend this book to anyone and would actually warn everyone to look elsewhere - preferably, just to the bible!"
5,Well made!,"I watched this special on the history channel about a week ago. The documentary tells the story of how the trial was put together, the problems during the trial and the aftermath (Sentences, how the trial holds up today, e.t.c). I would reccommend this video to anyone interested in history, particulary Nuremberg and other famous trials.(Note: One fact I did not know before I watched this was that during the executions, instead of their necks snapping instantly, several of the convicted instead slowly strangled to death. Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel alone took 28 mintues to die.)"
2,Not at all what was expected,"I found this barn very disappointing. The plastic material is flimsy and the pieces do not stay snapped together. It comes with stickers to decorate the barn and accessories, but peel off easily. I ordered it because I loved the features of the fold up/carrying style and trusted the renowned Breyer name... I thought it would be perfect for my 4 year old horse lover. My son lays on the floor and plays gently in imaginative play with this set, but even still the barn easily falls apart (windows and doors fall off, fence will not stay attached and falls down). The accessories are cheap plastic as well.This is [not worth the price] I paid. And certainly not worth the Breyer name."
2,Disappointing....colorless and rushed,"I'd never heard Leif Ove Andsnes before this recording, though I've heard a great deal about him, all of it flattering. I hope he's in general better than this recording, which left me flat. This is humorless Haydn, played with glassy polish and little else. There's no subtlty or wit in the performances, his pedaling is uniform (and uniformly dull), he's colorless, and he rushes the tempi constantly. A little is forgivable--we don't want stiff metronomic performances. But sometimes he nearly jumps ahead a whole beat, as in his entrance in the D Major concerto. Overall a disappointment, and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra plays the way he does...blandly. Hear Richter in the D major if you want to hear some impressive Haydn, though his Haydn is almost completely out of print. Pity. He shows you how it's done, and how much range you're missing by going with Leif."
3,Let's get something new out there!,"This albums is a middle of the road album, which pains me to say. Most of the songs are from previous albums. There is only three new songs (Dreamland, Too Little Too Late, and Just Love Somebody) out of 12 tracks. Most of the songs are from their last album, ""Lemon Tongue"". The Lemon Tongue album was a good album but I never intended to purchase this album to just have those same songs. It would be nice to have an album by these guys that resemble the days of Racing After Midnight and Monsters Under The Bed. If you are a true fan, then this is a purchase to have, otherwise hold off and purchase their next full no previously released album."
2,Sam Jenkins Sorbo movie,The plot is slow and the acting so-so. Sam Jenkins Sorbo is a good actress but limited by a dumb plot. A waste of her talent. Other characters are so shallow it is pathetic (especially the villian).
2,Laurel Line,"The book probably as originally published may have been good, but the quality of this copy is poor- the print is small and the pictures are washed out. Poor item."
1,"Horrible Support, Always with problems","The nice stuff about this device is you can backup very quickly. I backup 70GB exchange database in 20 minutes (3GBx minute).But every 2 months I always had issues with tapes, scsi errors, etc.I do not recommend this device. And the support is terrible, they always call me from INDIA or non-english native language country after weeks of problems, slow support, bad service, terrible device."
5,"Very light, great output, adjustability, and durability","I use this stove regularly on backpacking outings (usually one or two nights, and just about once a month). It weighs absolutely nothing, and has great output--particularly for boiling water. It's also very adjustable--which is great for controlling heat on more complex cooking--ie pancakes. Highly recommended, as a cartridge stove. The downside (which is a cartridge downside) is that it does use lots of fuel vs. an equivalent white gas stove, which means you need to pack additional fuel for more complex cooking (ie more than boil and heat). Also -- since it mounts directly on the cartridge -- if you're low on fuel you can't use the ""turn the fuel canister upside down"" like you might be able to on a MSR Windpro or other remote canisters.Finally, yes, it's not as stable as a tripod stove, but it more than makes up for it in weight.I'd recommend this for ultralight backpacking in a heartbeat."
2,Not what it seems.,"This book is actually a 31 page pamphlet rather than a paperback book. The information on making mustard is woefully short, the bulk of the book being rather pedestrian recipes for using mustard.The recipies remind me of the ones on that back of store packages. Most of them seem to have mustard included simply so the recipies can be included in this book."
3,"Gah, The Angst!","Moving away from the story in order to develop new relationships between the characters was a bold move that does not pay off this time. Having spent so little time developing the supporting cast in earlier episodes, these episodes play out as drawn out and boring and by the time they get back to the primary story, it's hard to really care. Being that we're only at the halfway point though and this volume ends on a note that I certainly didn't see coming, I'm willing to bet that this series will make a nice comeback and find a way to regain its momentum for the second half. This one though we'll chalk up as a tragic misstep."
3,Ok...some of the time,"I first bought this product because at 4 months, my girl was waking and going crazy when I changed her at her feeding at 3am. She wouldnt calm down even after eating.. I wanted an overnite diaper so I could just feed her and put her down again. I bought the size 3's, impossible to find out there, I could only get them on Amazon. Well, I dont know what happened. they worked great, no leaks, for 2 months. The last week, she is drinking the same amount, and waking covered in pee every morning now i have to remove all bedding and change her and wipe her down. She doesnt mind, but I do, I dont want these to stop working. They cost a lot more on top of the regular day diapers. Now, it seems I have to change her at night anyway, even while using them. I get up around 3 or 4am and she's dry, but at 7 she is soaked. I dont know why all of a sudden they dont work. She is drinking the same amount of fluid."
2,"Good, but not great.","Our son is 4 mos old and sleeps thru the night. I found that these diapers did not fit well on the sides. There just wasn't enough material to cover. But they do cover the belly and back area to prevent leaks well when he is rolling around. My big problem with these is that our son has very sensitive skin and he broke out in a rash 3 days after he started to use them. There is a little disclosure on the package regarding gel particles that help absorb, but can get on your babies skin. I would rather he wet the bed in the morning, than be miserable with a rash all day."
3,Good but it is like a recital but she was 18,I will have to get a MP3 and learn how to download them. That must be the way of the future
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this travel alarm to use while traveling through China and South Korea. Not once did the time change to the correct local time - and that's why I purchased it. It won't even change when I travel from the central time zone to mountain. The clock is much too large for a travel alarm (about twice the size of my 20 year old Seiko.) The only bonus is the fact that the clock batteries are inexpensive. Oh, did I mention that the alarm is not loud enough to wake me?"
3,Half a clock,"Travel alarm with automatic time set feature was exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, auto time set was the onlything that worked. The alarm, light, and options functions did not work. I returned the travel alarm 10-29-2011 and I'mwaiting for a reply."
5,A Great Introduction to a Wonderful Author,"I really enjoyed all three stories in this compendium. As other reviewers have noted, Brautigan's stories all have an absurdist flair, and satirical themes that are always fun and often thought provoking. The fact that these stories still resonate so many years after they were written is a testament to both the author's prose and themes. He has a breezy way of writing and manages to keep the reader engaged in some very unlikely scenarios (even when he breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience). For anyone interested in fun reading and an introduction to a great, somewhat forgotten author, this book is for you."
1,Remnant,"This book was labeled ""New"", but it has the the distinctive black mark indicating it's a remnant. It's old, it's dirty, it's shopworn."
4,A Brautigan time capsule,"It's been a couple of decades since I last read Brautigan. I was surprised to find this collection at all, thinking his stuff way out of print and out of Literary Fashion along with all that other sixties hippie-dippie stuff. Couln't be any good. Wrong! The three stories are a delight, fast paced, and imaginative. Confederate General reads like the best of the beat writers, evoking the relationship between Kerouak and Cassidy. The other two stories are nearly as good, with strong but simple characterizations. I can remember what it was to live like the folks in these books, in a time filled with challenge and promise and new freedoms. Before grey hair, IRA's, and desk top computers. Read these. Let the wind blow through your hair a little! March 29, 1998."
1,what a service!!,"Totally appalling service, having paid for an expedited delivery, it took 2 weeks to get the book. No wonder it took an extra two weeks for a request to review the service.rating should have been 0 not 1 star"
3,Treatise on Older Lesbians,"This read like a doctoral treatise; I would like to have had it in plainer, everyday language!"
4,DRAMA IN FUTURISTIC SETTING,"No action, no revolutionary technology... quite political/social actually.Its all about Kinnall Darival and his journey from royalty to bureaucrat to dissident to fugitive.Not a difficult book to read although the beginning was a little tedious.Thought provoking piece."
1,Customer Service is An Absolute Nightmare,"I had lost my Viruscan CD and requested via their online customer service for assistance with a replacement copy.After more than 2 months and series of very frustrating emails, I am still without a replacement CD. First it took more than a month for Mcafee to finally acknowledge my proof of purchase. And it's been nearly a month since they last emailed to say that issue is being looked into.Often, when I send a reminder about my unresolved problem, someone new responds and asks me to fill in all the tedious details again to show proof of purchase. Then they forgot all about my emails till I emailed them again.I have never in my life encountered worse customer service than that provided by McAfee. And when I checked on the internet, it seems that I am not the only one with horror stories about McAfee's customer service.I have given up and will be buying Norton instead."
5,Lieber has it right!,"Lieber tells to straights. It certainly appears that(1) ADM can steals billions from US taxpayers and no one can stop them.(2) ADM has polical connects which goes to the top of US government (decades)(3) ADM used a tiny amount of (scam) funds to buy ADM execs out of prison(4) ADM will financially destroy anyone who tries to stop them(5) ADM has the power to control prosecuters, so whistleblower goes to prison(6) Message to Public: Do not assist feds as they will turn on youP.S. These good FBI agents were ultimately overruled by higher level officials"
4,"Perhaps unfair, but scrupulously researched","Like everyone else, I was only vaguely aware of ADM before I read this book. I won't forget ADM soon, though. All the dirty tricks you hear about seem to have been concentrated in one company: everything from antitrust violations to bribery and intimidation. Short of treason, it's hard to think of a crime ADM didn't commit.James Lieber has done a tremendous amount of research, and it shows. Even when no first-hand sources are available, he is often able to reconstruct a conversation or meeting, and he is very fair about drawing a clear line between facts and suppositions. My only complaint is that he can get a little carried away in his criticism, blaming ADM for practices common to many American corporations (e.g. political contributions, influence peddling, media spin). However, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise outstanding book. Buy it and read it."
1,Not good for beginner or expert,"This book is the worst written of the series. It is vague about some steps, leaves out others, which can leave a beginner floundering and frustrated. It also assumes a fair bit of 'artistic' ability.It's good in that it can demonstrate some techniques very well, such a scaling - but it doesn't really help or encourage a beginner to 'get creative'. Which is the whole point of the application."
4,Not for the advanced user.,"Adobe Illustrator 7, Classroom in a book is a well organized, comprehensive guide to the program. It's great if you are new to the program. However, it doesn't tell you much more than the tutorial that came free with earlier iterations of the program. If your looking for a book on advanced technique, this is not it."
1,ITEM WAS UNAVAILABLE AND NOT SHIPPED BY AMAZON,I FOUND THE ITEM FROM ANOTHER VENDOR AS AMAZON WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE AND SHIP.
2,oh no tell they get better than this...,"I have up to this point, been a Xanth fan, and gone out of my way to follow the series, which believe me is VERY difficult... anyway after much perseverance I finally got my paws on this one, and it is disappointing to say the least! The puns and creativity seems to have degenerated into serious overkill, that makes it, and the story line brim with tedious, banal, stupidity! I LOVE these books, but they've got to get better than this! PLEASE somebody tell me they get better than this..."
5,This Book Is A Fantastic Journey!,"5 stars!! This book has all the magic of Xanth and then some! Join 3 interesting characters on their amazing quests in the punny, exciting, and wonderful land! Travel into the realm of the gourd and encounter an amazing animated skeleton, head underground and explore the different kinds of creatures who reside there and see how they can help poor Volney who is looking to fix the Vale, find out how Cherie reacts to Chem and Xap's daughter, and much, much, more! If you are a Xanth reader, this is obviously a must-have, and if you are not then this will get you hooked! Remember to look for the other great Piers Anthony novels to suit your taste and quench your thirst for adventure- they're out there waiting for you to order, read, and enjoy them! As a more than satisfied fan of Xanth I truly suggest you do just that with this book....What are you waiting for?"
1,Keep batteries handy,"I bought this radio, not from Amazon, and found it worked splendidly for about a month. Then the generator crapped out. Well, not entirely. It played about about the same length of time that the generator was wound. Having very little patience with electronics that do not work properly, I depositied it in the same place I did a Canon scanner. On the sidewalk, tossed from my second floor.I see from the reviews that others have had better luck and with the Grundig name, I expected better. But, as stated above, keep batteries handy."
2,Barely adequate,"1. In my environment (urban) I received no listenable shortware channels at all. Selectivity is nonexistant.2. FM works fine...at the level of a $10 radio that is.3. The sound is very, very tinny and having the radio level turned up causes distortion very rapidly.4. There is a rather nice carrying case of the typical non-waterproof nylon variety. I find it useless.Consider this *only* an *emergency radio*, without any other value at all."
1,"Avoid this cheesy, flimsy dog","On a catalog page the price might seem right, but this is NOT a radio or flashlight you would want to count on in an emergency. Sensitivity is low, but not low enough to make up for the poor selectivity and fiddly, imprecise tuning. This thing is incredibly poorly made, with loose wiggly knobs, switches that are hard to operate, and a magneto crank that feels like it's about to break right off. A bad deal at half the price. Far better AM/FM/weather channel sets are available for the same price or less. If you absolutely must have shortwave, don't throw good money away on this overpriced toy; for just a bit more you'll find outstanding choices like the Sony ICF SW35. If low price is critical, get the cheapest AM/FM pocket radio you can find, pick up a cheap flashlight, and every few months treat yourself to a couple of new batteries."
1,Grundig FR200 Emergency Radio,"I purchased the Grundig FR200 Emergency Radio as part of an emergency kit I'm putting together. Unfortunately I'll have to find another radio. The reception for this radio is so poor, that the few stations I can tune in to are full of static and difficult to understand. I live in the Philadelphia area with plenty of stations to choose from, but very few can be tuned in with this radio. I can't recommend this radio to anyone."
2,Not fully working,"This radio was sold with a flashlight feature that doesn't work, which was not mentioned in the seller's ad. Yet he asked full price. That's not right. It's the product I wanted, but this particular item is not of good quality. Beware of this seller."
2,Fact and Fiction,"This book is full of interesting facts. Unfortunately, the author looks through colored glasses, and they're not rose-colored. Granted, neither is the history of the Mormon church. But Abanes uses careful wording, quietly sliding adjectives and adverbs into his prose,to lead the reader to erroneous conclusions. His intent is to arouse anger, indignation, and fear.Abanes obviously has an agenda--and it is not to ""tell the whole truth."" It is to sully Mormonism. ""One Nation Under Gods"" is religious propaganda masquerading as history--no matter how many facts are represented. If you're looking for a book written by an actual historian, look elsewhere."
5,A Wealth of Information,"For those looking for a great introduction to this issues this is an excellent book. It is loaded with source material, but is very readable. If you have never studied Mormon history this book will serve you well as a great one volume resource."
1,The Picasso of Literature,"If you want to read anti-mormon literature, save your money and look it up on the internet. That is basically all this book is;a bunch of events and quotes taken out of context, and at times, made up alltogether, in an effort to disprove the Mormon Church. If you are looking for a real history, this is not the place to find it."
2,Exposé,"The book contains lots of interesting information. In my opinion, the author demonstrated his limited understanding of human nature. The author would do well to broaden his horizons by investigating and writing an expose on the origins of Christianity and then re-write ""One Nation Under Gods."" I was disappointed that the author ended the book without a chapter containing a summary and conclusions."
5,Oh Yesss...good stuff,"I had heard of The Rentals, but it took me a while to actually listen to them and give them a chance. This cd is awesome from start to finish, too bad there aren't more songs, but at least all the tracks on here are good. Its rather refreshing to hear a band like The Rentals that have that rare ability to let you slide into that relaxed state where you can just sit back and flow with the music. The Moog and the violins have a soothing sound and put me in a good mood whenever I'm listening to this cd, plus The Rentals have that garage band mystique to them which I think is cool. Anyway, this is one of my favorite cds and I recommend it to anybody."
5,I'm a friend of P. Are you?,"This album is definetly in my top tive, number three, right behind weezer's first to albums. The moog synthesizers have a relaxing electric sound that gets you movin'.RENTALS FACT: Matt Sharp sold most of his personal possesions to make this album."
5,"For 2 bucks, you get a great little album","I'm pretty biased being an old school Weezer fan. I remember waiting for their next album and this little beauty hit me. Matt Sharp teams up with the Haden sisters. (Rachel, Petra) It's got these great little rock out synthy moments and Matt collaborated with Rivers on some the most interesting Weezer songs (Blue album and Pinkerton) this is sort of Matt taking a weird turn from his other efforts, if ""Say it Ain't So"" and ""Undone the Sweater Song"" are favourites of yours then I'm sure you'll like ""Friends of P"" two dollars is worth that song alone."
5,"Moog, Violin, Matt Sharp, RENTALS!","Wow, my friend reccomended this to me, and me being a huge Weezer fan decided to check it out. I was blown away, from beginning to end this album flows with intense feeling. The Moog lines are crazy and the violin really adds a rare element to the Rentals. Each and every song sticks with you. Hey, and if you like Weezer and the Rentals, you should also check out Ozma. BUY THIS!"
2,I wasted my money on this one...,"I was so disappointed with this CD. At least 6 of the songs were recorded from VERY OLD albums....scratches and all! They were SO bad. I play two of the songs over and over...the only two I liked. When I read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs, I assumed that they meant doubles of the same song....I was wrong. I don't know WHY they had to add the scratchy music..a filler? I would quickly skip to another song...only to have to ""skip"" many times!!"
5,Wonderful and very inclusive of many singers.,The selections were interesting. Hearing how each performer sang them was also nice. Considering that some of the recordings were from the early 20th century they were very nicely mastered for now. As thrilling as when I was sitting in a movie theater watching Fantasia and feeling chills run up and down my spine during the Ave Maria segment.
3,Speaker stand,Good low cost stand. Was easy to set up. Need to be careful as stand sturdy but can be knocked over if speaker is heavy.
3,128MB Smart Media users beware,"This reader was easy to set up and worked GREAT with my 32MB Smart Media card. I recently bought a 128MB Smart Media card and my computer (800 MHz P3 with Windows 98SE) crashes every time I try to read this card. I called Lexar tech support, and they said it only works up to 32MB Smart Media cards. I downloaded the updated driver from the website, and now it works intermittently. Typically, it crashes my computer, I hard reboot, it may or may not crash a second time, then it reads the card. So eventually it works, and I have never lost any picture files, but I am going to buy a dedicated Smart Media reader to avoid these problems."
4,Sowa makes a hit with The ABC's of Success in Simple Terms,"This book is a rarity, something the whole family can use together. Kids and adults will share in the lesson's that can be learned in 53 simple to read and easy to explain pages. Sowa breaks it down and explains the fundemental skills he has used to and preached his entire life. Anybody can be a sucess as long as you follow his books character "" Mr. Successo"" and are willing to try....then the sky is the limit. This is the type of book that should be shared among family and freinds..its along the line of ""Who Moved my Cheese"". Excellent, I wonder if this is a single book or a planned series?"
2,"Pass on "" The ABC's of Success in Simple Terms""","The book attempts a great concept but falls short. Sometimes confusing and misleading, the author seems to lose focus from what he started out doing in the first few pages to the last one. Mostly common sense, and little insight your money may be best spent elsewhere."
5,Back to Basics,"After the controversy of EROTICA...Madonna decided to go back to basics. The light, but fun BEDTIME STORIES, and this compilation of her ballads SOMETHING TO REMEMBER, and they are at that.This is a collection of her best ballads, ranging from its earliest a remake of her 1984 cover ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"", to her most recent ""Take A Bow"". There are also some new songs, ""I Want You"" with Massive Attack, a great ballad that just sweeps over you, she is performing well vocally and musically. ""You'll See"" is one of her most compelling ballads I've heard in a long time, and a huge hit with the fans, it will always be a classic. ""One More Chance"" is a beautiful song with great acoustics and vocals.If you loved her hits like ""Live To Tell"", ""This Used To Be My Playground"", ""Rain"", ""Oh Father"", ""Crazy For You"", etc you will love this cd. It compiles all of her best ballads on one cd, with some excellent new songs as well."
2,:/,"The CD and Artwork are in great condition, BUT it promised it would have the back cover artwork and it was missing it. :(, I was really upset about that.The album is great though, Im not into Compilation albums, but this album has so many of Madonna's greatest songs. Oh Father, You'll See, Ill remember, This used to be my Playground, One more Chance, Rain, Live to Tell.All the songs have a really deep meaning, and are all wonderful and under rated. Oh Father is definitely my all time favorite Madonna songs, its so melancholy, but has a great meaning to it."
4,Crazy for this collection of songs,"I've liked Madonna's music for a long time. It's touched me emotionally since I was young. I only have two Madonna albums -- Ray of Light and Something To Remember. I bought this album because it had my favorite songs on it, ""Live To Tell,"" ""Crazy For You,"" ""Rain,"" ""I'll Remember"" among others. This CD was cheaper than buying all of her previous albums. I can't tell anyone what to recommend, but I like listening to this CD."
5,Her voice is incredible on this album.,"Madonna's voice has grown tremendously over the past two decades as is evidenced on this CD. I initially bought this CD for two songs, but when all her ballads are compiled into one CD, the way they flow from song to song is amazing. I have fallen in love with her music all over again."
3,Read it for fun,"De Mente's terribly out of date book is an excellent glimpse of what the sex trade in Japan must have been like in the fifties and sixties. While often terribly politically incorrect, at least de Mente's anecdotes keep the reader entertained. The book is also defiantly unapologetic about the aims of sex seeking readers and foreigners in Japan. An interesting read, but don't suppose that it will help your ""game"" if you travel to Japan."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Rich people pissing off plot.Given it is Ben Elton, it is not going to be completely serious.However, with this plot of the world's filthy rich building a habitat so that they can escape the terrestrial pollution he is of course commenting on what is going on, or what was going on at the time.Definitely funny at times, despite that.3.5 out of 5"
1,Derivative Vonnegut,"Bought this because I loved his latest, Inconceivable, and still do. This early work is derivative of Kurt Vonnegut in style, plot, tone, etc....and real Vonnegut isn't much to write home about.I rarely encounter a book so tedious that I give up reading halfway through. Guess what I did here."
3,Not bad ay,"I havent yet read the book but it seems in good condition, well as good as was to be expected from the description given upon purchasing it. It came in good time and all round I'm pleased with the out come of the transaction. Thank you :)"
3,whitehead and blackhead extractor is not as good as I expected,"This tool is good in the sense that it has kept me from using my finger nails to pop zits. However, even with use of this tool I have experienced some minor bruising and scarring on my face. This tool does not extract the whiteheads and blackheads as easily as I thought it would but it definitely removes blackheads easier than it does whiteheads and it works best when you drag it across an area of skin rather than try to target in on one zit at a time."
1,Not good,I bought this to replace one I lost during a move. I owned the previous one for 10 years and it worked great. I couldn't even make this one work. I think the problem with it stems from the finish. The unpolished stainless steel seems to pull the skin rather than slide across it. The small loop is also quite flimsy compared to my previous.
5,Beautiful delicious food !,"Some of these recipes are a bit familiar but with the author's own twist . Many are very different. They are all delicious and didn't require additional seasonings and herbs to make them flavorful enough,which I frequently find with cookbooks. There are no pictures which is too bad because his dishes are colorful,but then the price is reasonable.... I want to know where he is a chef,I'd like to try that restaurant !"
2,Definitely a book to pass by,"Bought this book based on reviews and because I wanted to have add some vegetable dishes to my meals. These recipes had some very expensive and little used spices in them. Butternut squash is constantly used throughout the book, not an easy vegetable to cook with. Both my husband and I religiously tried these recipes but they took alot of time and at times bland."
5,GREAT cook book!,"I've had this cookbook for four years and I love it. The recipes are all very good and aren't missing anything by not having meat or dairy. They're very creative, restaurant-worthy recipes that non-vegans such as myself will love as well. I like that the author didn't try to copy recipes with meat and dairy like ""macaroni and cheeze"", which never taste like what they're trying to imitate although they might be good if you don't think of it as mac and cheese. I especially enjoy the soup and chili recipes!"
5,"Worked as expected, good value.","I have had this recorder for almost two weeks now and all functions work as expected. The recorded DVD-R has no problem viewing in other players (including GE, Shinco, KLH, Go-Video, and Sony) and I have not experienced the black-level problem.Here are some suggestions for improvment:1) better manual ... I guessed the problem could be from Japanese to English translation2) bigger numeric keypad in the remote control3) improve loading time during power-on initializationOverall, I am satisfied with this product."
1,Recorded DVD video disc would not play!,"I spent hours trying to create a DVD video disc of a soccer game wihtout success. The original video content was loaded into its Hard Disk Drive (HDD) with no problem. THe creation of a DVD Video disc was another story. I used DVD-R disc and followed the instructions line by line. At the end of the disc creation process, the machine went into the disc finalizing mode to complete the process. But then it immediately went into the loading mode (you can see the word LOADING on the upper right corner of the screen). After a few minutes, it stopped and gave me a message that the disc was either damaged or dirty. This is the same disk that it just recorded. I spent 7 hours and wasted 6 discs and gave up. I do not recommend this recorder!"
1,"The Good, the Bad & the UGLY","THE GOODThis unit does have some nice features like the menu creation and library functions.The BADI couldn't believe it until I called Toshoba tech support myself. You have NO control over burn speed!THE UGLYCall it ""Black Level"" or whatever you want, but playblack on ""most"" other units will look washed out! This is a HUGE BLUNDER!My advice is if you are thinking about this unit, purchase from a retailer with a liberal return policy.I can't recommend this unit until these issues are resolved."
1,Amazon.com misleading,"I ordered this dvd recorder over three weeks ago, it took them this entire time to send me an email yesterday that said it was not available, I have now wasted three weeks waiting for this, and now must start completely over trying to find a good deal. I cannot see why they can start processing an order, and not be able to check availability within a reasonable amount of time..Interesting point is that even today, Amazon website still lists it as able to ship, which I find extremely misleading !!!I will not use Amazon.com again !!!"
2,Please put the torch on low,"First let me say I am a HUGE fan of Patti Lupone - onstage, live,in a musical, she is flawless, brilliant. But this cd? Please,where is the intimacy in her voice as if she is speaking only to you? Nowhere, as usual. Her songs are loud, her voice is loud,it has, unfortunately over time become harsh and brassy. She sounds like what Ethel Merman ended up sounding like (early recordings of the Merm when young hear a laser like phenomenal instrument, warm and touching)at the end of her career. No warmth, no softeness, no caressing in this voice anymore. It's sad, really, and so is this cd.LIRIO"
5,Worked as advertised,"Replaced evaporater and decided to replace this too. Worked great, quality was fine and fit perfectly. Would buy again.So great to be able to get these types of things from Amazon instead AutoZone..."
1,Don't buy it -- poor format and little to offer,"Hopefully Peachpit will keep the Real World Bryce series alive, because ""The Bryce3 Handbook"" has little to offer to Brycelings. This book was written in a great hurry to get it out first before any other publishing company could and it shows. Real World Bryce2 by Susan Kitchens is much more helpful even if it was written for Bryce2 and not Bryce3."
2,Marginally Functional / Barely Useable,"I bought one of these natural gas heaters mainly because it has electronic features including a timer as well as a fan built-in. At first it worked well but less than 6 months later the digital thermostat barely works which means the temp will drop as much as 6 degrees from the set temp before the heat goes on then over shoot several degrees before shutting off. The difference in comfort between 65 degrees and 59 degrees is huge! The built-in fan, which is meant to come on a minute or two after the heat comes on, now usually comes on after the heat turns off. The electronic pilot light is a nice feature however the pilot shuts off randomly and once the pilot is off there's no heat until it is restarted manually by pushing the ignition button. I use this heater to supplement my central heat and am in an area that doesn't get super cold. If I depended on this heater as my primary heat it would be completely useless and I would have rated it 1 star."
4,A must-read for every daughter!,"I'm so glad Anna-Sofia and Elizabeth have written this book-- because if they didn't, I would have! :) If you, as a daughter, have ever found yourself wondering, ""what am I supposed to be doing?"", then this book should give you the answer. Using a very non-confrontational question-and-answer format, these two sisters give a very thorough treatise on the role of a daughter in the home. As a daughter myself, it was a blessing to know that someone finally had the courage to write on such a sensitive, but needful, subject. Feminists, beware-- if you think a woman's place is ""anywhere BUT the home"", you will certainly not agree with this book. But if you think that self-fulfillment is found by encouraging and helping others (including husbands and fathers) to fulfill their dreams, then this is the book you've been waiting for!"
1,"Not quite finished yet, but...","I recieved this book from my cousins for Christmas. It is basically full of unsupported sweeping generalizations (like this sentence) that are poorly developed. I have dubbed it the ultra-conservative Christian manifesto for women. The young authors advocate a return to a non-existent American paradise where women live to serve their fathers, then husbands and do not think for themselves. The problem is that they try to pretend that there was absolutely nothing good that came out of feminism, and we should not try to deal with the world we live in, but rather retreat into our own little cloisters. And it's full of questionable hypotheses. To top it all off, the authors annoy me. They are inexperienced and obviously still have a lot to learn about persuasive writing. Avoid this book."
1,"Overlord D-Day, June 6, 1944","I have studied WW II for over 50 years and read every book I could find on the subject. This is the first book that has tried to convince me that the Germans had the finest army, leadership, and equipment during the war. All the allies, with the exception of a few units, were blundering fools. The only allied leader who knew what he was doing was Montgomery, and his commanders and troops let him down.Patton and the 3rd Army had a walkover, only facing second rate units, I am sure those men will be surprised to learn that fact.I was under the impression that the allies won the war.I rate this book as 1, only because 0 is not allowed."
1,Are you serious?,The worst movie I have ever seen in my life! I can't believe that Amazon rips people off with this thing! BTW I would have given it ZERO STARS if I could have!!
3,Another book of names,A comprehensive list detailing the origin and meaning of a multitude of names -
1,Save your money!,"I won't be as kind as some of the other reviewers who were disappointed in this edition. It's a load of crap! Back in the 80's it was the only thing going, but each successive edition has gotten less and less helpful, until it's finally degenerated to a great big commercial for What's Playing On The Radio. Hey, if I needed to know what was playing on the radio, I'd turn on the radio!I just saved you thirty bucks. You can thank me later."
5,"Great Battery, Great Price",I read other reviews and decided this would be the best deal. It payed off the price was great and the battery is great at least as good as the original battery that came with cam-corder.
5,Looks great and works well,"I've had this watch for several years, and I've been very pleased at how well it performs. It looks great and works well."
1,Deceiving Title,"Make no mistake....these cartoons are from the 1940's, but they consist of two hours of ""Hunky and Spunky"" (a mother and son wild donkeys) and ""Gabby"", an overbearing little character I saw for the first time from the movie ""Gulliver's Travels"". Two hours of just THEM! I would never have bought the DVD had I known that. I can take a few Hunky and Spunky cartoons, I cannot take two hours of GabbY. The title should have had some clarification."
4,Great Stocking Stuffer,I recently seen this book at work in a basket auction.I came home and had to order one online. I thought it was neat that it lights up...and know my daughter would love it also.Great gift idea!!!
2,Not for a beginner,"I'm a beginner in mediation and download 'Quantrum Light Breath' from Amazon. There was 1 reviewer who gave it 5 stars and it sound like it would be a guided mediation to breathing with something funny happening (per the other reviewer). Anyway, I listen to it for 20 minutes and had to turn it off. There was so much moaning & groaning going on, I didn't know what to make of it. I might try to listen to it again, when I'm prepared for it."
4,Catching the Moment,"This Polaroid One Step Express Instant Camera is not the latest model, but it is good & fun enough for people who want to ""catch the moment""-- take and get pic in hands within 3 min.Digital cameras & images are great. You can almost take as many as pictures you want and would not be afraid of wasting your films. As the instant film is more expensive, you may not take pic that ""freely"" but what's on the pic will be what you treasure and you would like to keep. The size, shape, & texture of the instant film can give you something different & a little ""nostagia"" flavor.There was black & white film for this model, unfortunately, they are no longer manufactured. So, only color films are available for its use. That's a little disappointing, but I think this camera is still fun to have. :)"
1,very disappointed,"I bought this camera for my children at school and was very excited, only to find out that polaroid no longer makes the film for this type of instant picture. All these polaroid cameras are virtually useless, unless you already have the film on hand! Potential buyers should know this. Disappointed and in possession of a 'useless' camera! Buyers beware"
4,Quirky Pop With Smart Lyrics,"This album is basically unknown, but it's actually not that bad. ""Whoever You Are"" sounds like nothing else here, but it's a clever song with a sound similar to Sugar Ray's hits ""Fly"" or ""Every Morning."" It probably should've been a bigger hit than it was. ""Lotta Stuff"" is a fun punk rocker that slows down completely at times and the tune seems to come from a stuffed teddy bear's mind. There's even a few nice ballads like ""Don't Close The Door"" and ""Gina"" that seem somewhat honest, and they show Geggy Tah can play in a variety of styles. Most of the other tracks are simply funny tales about nothing special, the best of which is probably ""Las Vegas With The Lights Out."" It's too bad nobody really picked up on Geggy Tah because they show with SACRED COW that they have raw talent and ability that could grow someday into something special."
1,I gave it a chance.,"I try and keep an open mind when I hunker down to listen to an album. I don't keep in mind what critics say or what my friends say, I want to value it on my own terms. After listening to this, I am convinced this is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. Everything about this album is annoying...the guys in the band are trying too hard to be strange and not hard enough to write a decent song. The lyrics rarely make much sense, and the music itself isn't terribly original. I have to give these guys credit, though, for trying new things. There are several instruments on here I haven't heard on a CD before. However, don't listen to me, BORROW (don't buy!) this album and make your own decision."
4,Sacred Cow has more than just a one hit wonder...,"I'll be honest, I bought the CD for the song ""Whoever You Are""...based on that television commercial. I was pleasantly surprised that the rest of the CD, while different than that song, pretty much rocked. This is a CD you can put in, and listen from beginning to end, straight through. There are not too many that can get away with that, so this one is definitely a keeper."
3,"Sorry, Enya, but you are my favorite.","Not that bad, but it's not the melodies I'm used to listen from Enya and contains some melodies from other recordings."
4,More of the Same Great Stuff,"Ok, first off, Enya rocks. If you don't know that already, go buy her compilation album, Paint the Sky with Stars. It will enlighten you. If you already know how good she is and you aren't desperate to buy everything she's ever done, there is something wrong with you.All right, so maybe Enya isn't for everyone. But you will likely appreciate her if you have ever been truly moved by a dreamy piece of music. She is soft, soulfull, and dynamic. And yeah, so her music all sounds the same, but when it's so good, how can you complain?Highlights from The Memory of Trees include ""The Memory of Trees"", ""Anywhere Is"", ""Athair Ar Neamh"", and ""On My Way Home""."
3,So-So monitor,"The product work fine if you DON'T use the Advance Positioning Sensor. With that turned on I had to raise my arm well above my head for it to registor that it was lever with my heart, wether I was standing or sitting. Other than that it seemed to work pretty well."
4,First time user review,Omron HEM-637 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with Advanced Positioning SensorIts almost 2 months i have purchased this product. Until now it is working fine and is convenient.
4,Easy and Accurate,I had the nurse check my Omron HEM-637 at my last Dr. visit and she said it was right on target with their equiptment. I believe that the position sensor is a positive feature although it did take a little getting use to to get the unit in proper position level. It's got a nice case to keep it in. I like it very much.
2,Easy to use BUT............................,"Omron HEM-637 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with Advanced Positioning SensorThe doctor told me my blood pressure was high and to purchase a bp monitor. After reading several reviews, I decided on this model. It had good consumer reviews and it seemed very easy to use compared to the arm cuff monitors. After purchase, I took it to my doctor's office and the nurse did my pressure and it was high on their equipment and lower by 20 points on this monitor. The doctor came in about 20 minutes later and retook it and he had the same results to. He said that I needed to get a Large Cuff monitor because I would get a much more accurate reading and it I could better control my blood pressure and my chance of stroke.So as cool and easy as this model is to use, my health is more important and I am returning this WRIST MODEL and ordering a Large Cuff monitor"
5,My doctor was impressed,"I took this Omron along with me on two visits to my doctor to compare it's readings with their office device. My doctor had expressed reservations about the accuracy of wrist cuff types of BP monitors, but both times, the readings were within several units, and my doctor was impressed enough to write down the brand and model number. That was good enough for me."
2,Multiple issues with this item.,This worked great for about 3 months. Now it won't even register 3/4 of the times that I use it. It doesn't seem to be made very well. I use it multiple times a day and it is very frustrating.
3,Important Missing Feature,"This is a good unit for monitoring blood pressure. Purchasers should know ahead that measuring blood pressure with a wrist style monitor is sensitive to arm position. The Intellisense system verifies your arm position before it takes a measurement, making it more consistent than units that do not. (Missing Feature) I lowered the rating to 3 stars because the unit is equipped with an interface port, which if you purchase the unit in Europe or Asia it also comes with software (missing in USA) and a cable (missing in USA) that allows you to download the data to your pc and share with the doctor. Omron refuses to support this feature in the USA (hence my aggravation)"
3,"Overpriced ""hook""","What you save on the CW50 you lose on the ribbons. The ribbons are about 10.00 which makes it imperative to find the absolutely lowest price. My CW50 broke down. It's under warranty so I sent it back. It ruined a ribbon in the process. A lot of websites say it's good for 50 prints. However, the back of the single pack says it's good for 40 prints. I was mislead. The price of the ribbons should be 3.99-5.99. I have been constantly complaining to Casio to get the prices down. You should not buy them if over 6.99 (I've found them at that price)"
4,"good product, good price","I purchased the casio cw-75 Disc title printer, and I am enjoying making professional looking titles on my dvd's and cd's. The ink cartridges for this little gem are convenient and easy."
4,"Great harmonies, melodies, and imagery.","The song ""From Whence Came the Cowboy"" tells the true multi-racial story of the American Cowboy. This album contains great renditions of some classic western songs, as well as some poetic songs of the New West. The songs are quite different from each other, but the melodies and lyrics are all in the western tradition. I have played it many times."
3,great for a time,Thought this dog bed was the one until I took off the cover and washed it per the instructions. The bottom of the bed is a plastic type product and it came unraveled from the flannel top material.
5,Good Product,"I prefer this flat type wire to the round type wire. Its easier to fasten to walls, etc. Works great."
4,Dark And Obscene,"This album is truly inspired by ''The X-Files''. The best song is ''Deep'', by Danzig. The only problem with the album is the remake of REM's **** Me Kitten. it has nothing to do with the show. Chris Carter wrote a song for the CD. I forget what it's called, but P.M. Dawn sings it. A good album for a good show."
5,Good music that goes along with the series.,It is a very good cd and I enjoyed it because it relates a lot to the show.
5,Neat trick!!!,"This is really neat. If you look at the liner notes it says "" Nick Cave and the Dirty Three would like to remind you that ""0"" is also a number"" When the CD starts, you can hold down the skip backwards button and it will rewind for about 8 minutes. When you let it play it will feature Nick Cave and the Dirty Three performing a eerily stunning spoken word piece entitled ""Time Jesum Transeuntum Et Non Riverentum"" (dread the passage of Jesus for he does not return). This piecce is followed by the Dirty Three's exquisite cover of the X-Files theme."
1,This is not salsa AT ALL!,"This video is terrible. The music is bad, the steps she introduces are not correct and mislead people on what salsa, mambo and cha-cha dances are about. Toghether with the music problems, the routines used are not even for the right and left side of the body. Actually it coul be very negative for your body. What a waste of money!"
1,This video was a HUGE disappointment!,"As a Salsa Instructor, I bought this video to use as a morning pick-me-up thinking that, at the very least, the music would be good. NOT! It was terrible! I went so far as to write a letter to the production company. The title is very misleading considering that NONE of the music is Salsa. It was some sort of new age style music that had nothing to do with Salsa. It was also very low impact, I didnt break a sweat. If Salsa is what you crave...this is not the video for you!"
4,"Good, but somewhat inconsistent","I love Jobim dearly, but like the liner notes point out, he's not a natural singer. The feeling he gives his songs can be incredibly sublime, yet often the quality of his voice and his inability to always sing on-key bother me. Add to that a few commercially-minded and annoying tracks like ""Surfboard"" and ""Bonita,"" and you get a album that true bossa nova lovers will only enjoy about half of. If anything, buy it for the wonderful performances of ""So Tinha de Ser Com Voce,"" ""Useless Landscape"" and ""A Felicidade."""
5,Better than origianl,I got this as a replacement part. This is much sturdier than the original -- clearly an improvement since the original broke so easily.
2,Not my favorite.,"We have a lot of Gamewright games. This one was not our favorite. We don't really play it. If you are buying your first Gamewright game I recommend starting with Sleeping Queens, or another sure hit. I guess if you REALLY liked moose this could be just what your looking for, so I gave it 2 stars."
2,Uses electrical wiring!,"Numerous customers have complained about these not working but they really need to investigate things before buying, instead of griping because they purchases something without understanding the details.These get up to 1500 feet. I use them. HOWEVER they work through the electrical wiring in your house. If you have two plugs that are not on the SAME circuit, which is COMMON even in the same room, these will NOT work. There are many other things that can cause interference as well. In other words, this product isn't going to work in most houses."
4,"Easy to read, easy to understand.","As a programmer myself I found this book to be unlike most tech books in that it keeps the interest level up, not at all the usual dry, dull, verbage.Examples are consistant through-out the text with few exceptions. (Focusing mainly on the mythical Kelly Kayaker and her publisher's web pages) The CD with this book includes some great utilities, some shareware, some demo.Overall a good textbook."
2,"Which is bigger, this game or a trash can",The idea behind the game is good but the rules are so vague that if you are competitive at all than you can to make an argument for any play in the game. Every play may get challenged and your family may end up debating something stupid like whether air is bigger than a giraffe.Seems like it would be good for kids to get their minds going but doesn't seem to work very well with adults. Especially competitive ones.
4,Sometimes hilarious results!,"My 20 year-old son gave me this for Mother's Day. He, his girlfriend, my hubby and I played it right away. It was quick to learn and often the gameplay had absolutely hilarious results. For example, one group of cards read, ""a THIEF was in a NUN(he's stealing her virginity, my son explained), the NUN was in the DOGHOUSE (she's in trouble now! my hubby explained), the DOGHOUSE was in a PARADE, and the PARADE was in LEFT FIELD.You'll get the same type of results. So much fun and easy to learn and play."
5,Perfect for my charms,"Have been making wire wrapped stones and put these on the top, so they can be put on anything. Everyone is reaping the rewards for me using these"
2,HO7 error,"Got this as a gift 4 years ago, now I have a piece of junk with an HO7 error (bad motor). It will cost more to fix it than to just buy a new dvd player. My son got an Apex dvd player at the same time 4 years ago and it still works fine."
1,Another BAD review,"All we got was three years worth out of this unit. All of a sudden is just locked up, F07 error message, and that's the end of it. We used it maybe twice a week. What a piece! I will never buy another Panasonic appliance."
1,Ineffective amount,300 mg of freeze dried black raspberry powder equals a little over 1 black raspberry. You would have to take at least 50 capsules per day to obtain anything close to the level being used in research. Try an extract like this one for more potency:Black Raspberry Extract - equivalent to over 266 capsules of 300mg of freeze dried powderOr just purchase the pure powder and add to smoothies.
4,"very moving, good characters!","Mark Garrett had staked his greatest hope on this trip to St. Croix. From the time the jet left the gound in Atlanta, he was determined to leave the problems of his construction firm behind and focus on the love of his life---his little girl. They'd been apart far too long, and nothing mattered more to Mark than gaining custody of his own child. Father and daughter were getting reacquainted when the jet was rocked by turbulence and Beth was knocked unconscious. Mark had never met a woman like Dr. Chambers. She played the role of doctor well, maintaining a cool, professional facade. But beneath the doctor's ice-cold surface were the warm, vulnerable emotions of a woman. Her whiskey-brown eyes warned Mark to stay away. But one way or another, he was determined to find the heart of Dr. Catherine Chambers."
5,Awesome screen,"I have owned this LCD monitor for 4 years now and it has never failed me. Terrific quality, no flicker, and I love the square design of the screen. You don't see those too much any more. Both business and gaming oriented (I have played Halo 2, Cod4, Halo, and Cod1 on it, and it works perfectly). I would recommend this monitor wholeheartedly."
3,Not for tough chewers.,I bought this for my puppy (Golden Retriever) and he chewed it up in about two days. He chewed the WHOLE thing until there was nothing left. It did keep him interested though. I bought kong peanut flavor treats and those worked well. It was okay.
1,Shockingly flimsy,"I bought this because upwards of a dozen people had told me that Kong brand was the sturdiest, healthiest toy for my two semi-mouthy dachshunds. Less than ten minutes after starting to play with this chew toy, Duke ripped a two-inch jagged chunk off of the wide end, rendering it useless and unsafe. For a toy manufactured specifically to be chewed on by small dogs, this is an in excusably flimsy product, and I cannot recommend it to anyone."
5,My dog loves his Kong,"I have a 47 pound shepherd mix. He loves the challenge of getting treats out from inside the Kong. After we adopted him, he didn't want to play with it too much at first. Now, his tail wags like crazy when he sees us with the Kong in our hands."
5,favorite pasttime,"My female German Shepard has devoloped a habit of dropping this in my lap when I sit down in front of the TV in the evening, letting me know that it is time for her evening entertainment. Put a few of her favorites inside, and she is happy for hours. So far, it has proved to be industructable, and is by far her favorite toy, even surpassing a fresh bone to chew on!"
2,Dog Gone It!!!,"We have 2 labs and a chihuahua. Santa brought them Kongs for Christmas. They were VERY interested in the filling but didn't chew on the kong AT ALL:(.I was disappointed because my brother's dog loves his Kong. I guess in the case of the Kong, it depends on the dog, not the toy."
2,Brief interest shown at puppy stage when I smeared treats inside the core ...,"Got a small for my mid size spoodle when he was a baby.Though some token interest was shown initially - each time fleeting - the main attraction was that it bounces irregularly and you never know where it is bouncing to and puppy loved to chase and pounce on it. Didn't really catch on either but because of the size, puppy did token chew on it a little after catching it.Better than the dentals.psDo not leave outdoors, we lost it for a few months on the shady side of the house which gets sporadic son - it has faded a little and is showing miniscule scaly cracks.Love the concept though, just pooch prefers the natural eg soft bones etc"
4,"Kong Classic Small Dog Toy, Red",Toys came in perfect condition. They were exactly what I ordered.We are very happy with the toys and would order from this seller again.
1,Destroyed in seconds,"We have been buying only Kong toys for our small terriers, but this one was destroyed in seconds! This toy is definitely not for aggressive chewers. Make sure you get a Kong Extreme if you have crazy chewers like ours."
5,Multi-purpose Dog Toy,"Great toy for large breed 'chewers'. Great to play 'Fetch' with. The shape gives it an irregular bounce that fascinates my dog. She will chase it on her own just for fun. It is also great, satisfying her need to 'chew'. Seems almost indestructible. Highly recommended."
4,Very Durable and great time consumer,I got this for my Olde English Bulldog and he loves it. I usually put his treats in there and even some of his food and he will play with it until everything is gone. I haven't tried any of the Kong fillers or peanut butter in Kong toy so I don't know how much longer that would occupy him but it is definitely worth the money and a great buy.
2,small dogs only,This toy is not sturdy enough for a dog over 10lbs - learned the hard way. My 50lb dog bit the top off in les than 5 minutes
1,DO NOT INSTALL - Nightmare Software,I have spent the last 6 hours fighting with this crappy software. Fortunately I could never even get the software to install completely. Unfortunately this crap software doesn't uninstall either! Contacted McAfee tech support via chat and they suggested that I uninstall and then reinstall the software! Thanks! Have done it seven times... now going through the registry line by line removing the garbage left behind. Use Norton. Use Kasperksy. Use anything but this crap. You have been warned.
1,"Be afraid, be very afraid","This is very possibly the WORST software that I have ever attempted to use, and I've been working with computers for over twenty years! Everything the other folks said is true. I've used McAfee products in the past, but this one is a disaster. I'll never make the McAfee mistake again. I only wish that I had read some reviews before I purchased this non-working, non-returnable piece of crap! ZERO STARS"
2,Forget the Privacy Service,"As far as I can tell the Virus Scan and Firewall are pretty standard and work well. When you are assessing the price of this product assume this is all you are getting. Forget the Privacy Service module. It is a piece of software junk, and McAfee will not admit there is a problem. (Check out their technical forums for posts from angry customers). Their on-line help is next to useless, and their administrators behave like thought police - deleting any implied criticism. The Privacy Service interferes with various functions of the computer, in my case it shuts down internet access, whether its features are turned on or off. Only uninstalling it will clear the problem, then you have to re-install it as a standalone programme afterwards. When that crashes the connection it is near-impossible to get rid of it in a way that removes all traces. Don't buy yourself several hours of hassle - if you buy the product don't install Privacy Service at all."
1,JUNK-JUNK-JUNK!!!!,"Don't waste your money.1. Slows internet connection to a crawel.2. No support3. Disables mouse and keyboard optional menus4. Virtually useless until you disable everything.5. The worst virus software ever written6. I just pray that the uninstaller works better than the software.7. Oh, No, the uninstaller is CRAP to. Prepare to format your drive and spend the next few days installing everything all over again!"
1,Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidentia,This book is full of totally unsubstantiated allegations and written by two disgruntled journalists. I would love to read a factual book about Karl Rove but this book isn't it.
1,The subtitle should have been: The Lack Thereof.,"Karl Rove wasted his time: you can't get blood from a turnip. Summarize as follows: Bush's brain has long atrophied from lack of use. Never let it be said that the government won't hire the mentally-challenged. This country is being run by advisors, not by the president, and it'll take years to undo what's been done around the world because of it. Don't buy this book looking for an explanation of this phenomenon, you'd get further studying labaratory rats."
3,Bush's Brain,I bought this only so I could lament that I overpaid for Bush's Brain since it cost a whole penny.
3,I loved this story.,The relationship between the characters were very nice developed. The story had potential but for some reason it was not developed enough.
4,Extremely Hilarious in a immature South Park type of way,"This CD is extremely hilarious after I heard it in a long bus ride. However, the content of the CD is even worse than South Park which is pretty much beyond the limit of cuss words. Other than that, it was really funny so buy it if you love South Park and love Adam Sandler"
3,Amazing content and perfect sleep aid.,"Paul Ekman has arguably done the most ground breaking research with relation to understanding universal nonverbal cues, which is what this book is about and teaches. If you can read this book cover to cover you will be leaps beyond 99% of the population, that is a big if though. With that said this is well written and does not use challenging language for the layperson."
1,unmasking the face,I found this book to be laborious and definitely not worth the time or money. This is my opinion and in no way trying to discredit the author.
3,"Nice Small Remote, but Keyspan has bad Customer Care.","I found this remote easy to install and set up with my iMac G4. You can customize the buttons on the remote to do virtually anything from moving the mouse cursor to keyboard commands to quiting and opening different applications.The only problem I have had was when I upgraded to Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, the volume buttons no longer operate the system volume anymore. I have sent MULTIPLE emails to Keyspan with only a reply saying they will respond in 72 hours, but THEY DONT! Everytime I try to call nobody answers the phone.In conclusion, this is a great remote for controlling everything on your computer from a few feet away, but beware if you need any technical support because they may not be there to help you."
4,Perfect for MusicMatch,"As the title indicates, I bought this to control MusicMatch from the couch. Installation is a snap, it's pre-programmed so it controls the program right out of the box. I had a little trouble getting pause button to work, but I easily figured out how to program the button. I haven't tried this with other programs, but based on my experience so far, I don't doubt performance will be excellent.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because the included USB cable is a little too short, though it's passable."
4,This Game Rules!,"The new Star Wars plug-in video game is awesome. There are five different games that are included: The Gunship Battle, Grievous Onslaught, Coruscant Attack, Droid Invasion, and Utapau Chase. You are wielding lightsabers deflecting blasts from droids in one game while you are piloting a Jedi starfighter launching an attack on Separatist battleships on another.My favorite game is the Utapau Chase. I am Obi-Wan Kenobi tracking down General Grievous while being chased by enemy Bogas and avoiding turret gun fire. I can upgrade my blasters, armor my Boga, or acquire extra lives. This game combines the classic arcade game graphics with the versatility of a great video game. It is fast paced and fun. I would recommend this game to both Star Wars and video game fans alike."
4,where is the GameKey?,"How come they never came out with the GameKey for this? (GameKey is a cartridge that adds 2 more games)? I have noticed other Jakks plug and play games have slots for GameKey, but I have never seen them in stores. Did Jakks Give up on the GameKey idea?"
1,No power after just 4 months of use,"The wireless system is just horrible. For the brief moment of use which is barely four months, I had to deal with statics and loss of signal from the main unit constantly. The distance between them were maybe 8 to 10 feet at most and signal kept dropping with static. Then the power went out on the unit that connects the rear speakers and took a month and a half to repair. Its a total waste, I'd spend little more money and get a better one that works!!!"
1,Deserves No Stars,"This video is an absolutely amateurish waste of video tape. It is like an hour long homemade video which is essentially a commercial for some tour the video's makers, travel agent/tour operator types who make the mistake of appearing on screen and narrating, have thrown together without the assistance of anyone who knows how to competently make a video.The video focuses on one hotel in Cancun and one in Playa del Carmen, including such trivia as the fruit in their buffet, their water treatment system, and what the rooms look like. Lots of focus on places to shop, but not much in which a discriminating buyer would be interested. They show a bit of the beach and some of the activities there, and they go to the ruins at Tulum. If you only saw this video, you would assume that Cancun and the Mayan Riviera are destinations to avoid.This video is a complete waste of time and money."
5,Good boots,Good pair of boots. The booy size is spot on. The boots are very comfortable. We will see how they do this winter.
3,A Generally Worthwhile Release,"My first true exposure to BNL came via this album, which remains quite good several years later. Obviously more ""adult-oriented"" than their previous work, it contains several great tracks - ""Shoe Box"" (which sounds even better in the ""radio remix version""), ""Straw Hat & Old Dirty Hank"" (a happy song about an unhealthy obsession), and ""When I Fall"" are my favorites, plus bonus points for making ""Same Thing"" work, even though it shouldn't on paper. That said, the album can sound rather samey all the way through, and although there's nothing inherently wrong with them, several tracks just don't rate (""Stomach vs Heart"" and ""Spider in My Room""). A few more truly catchy numbers would have helped, too. Still, a worthwhile album."
4,My least favorite BNL Album....and it still gets four stars!,"BNL is my favorite band, and although this is my least favorite album, it is only because when you get goofy like me and rate all this stuff, something always has to be at the bottom. Still, this is a great collection of the Ladies' songs. My favorites are ""Break Your Heart"" where the character in the song is trying to end a relationship without feeling the guilt that always comes with being the breaker-upper. ""I Live With It Every Day"" is something to behold as it changes styles without breaking the mood of the piece. ""Straw Hat And Old Dirty Hank"" is probably my favorite because of the definitely creepy subject matter. This is a great album, but purchase ""Stunt"" or ""Gordon"" first to see if this is the band for you."
4,Good,"It can be a little repetitive, but otherwise I really liked it. I read it in less than two weeks. I bought it as a Christmas present for my dad and my sister. I bought Praying the names of Jesus for my mom. I haven't read it yet but I will soon.Worth the money. A good read."
4,Useful sometimes,"This item is great for dealing with larger blackheads and small pimples. It's hard to use for small blackheads though, and I haven't used it as much as I thought I might. Overall it's a good product though and I would buy it again--the lesions I used it on cleared up quickly and much more easily thanif I left them alone."
2,I liked it but ....................,I liked the way this fit and stabilized wrist movement. But it broke in less than 30 days where the strap attaches to the plastic.
4,MUSIC,"Exactly as published, music scores of Sting's album. Wanted it for a muso friend so he could play Fields of Gold. I'm still persuading him it would be a great idea!"
2,NOT as recorded,I am very disappointed. This transcription is NOT the same as what is recorded. The transcription for Fragile is particular poor.
5,cleverly rhymed using real world words,"This is the best early reading book I have found. The story rhymes throughout, making it so much easier to read. The story is fun and engaging. Let's face it: if kids don't like the storyline they aren't likely to read. Conflict is interesting to little ones trying to figure life out.Some reviewers got upset because the book uses words they consider inappropriate and because it depicts arguing characters. Unless your child leads a very restricted life and is homeschooled, they hear these words at school. Words like hate, brat, and fat are out there and your child hears them. Wouldn't you rather have a book that could start a dialogue about conflict resolution and appropriate words? To think you can simply avoid them is naive."
4,Great,"Very good album, all songs are very relaxing and catchy.My favorites are Good God's urge (amazing bass line)and Kimberly Austin."
2,Very Disappointing,"For any music lovers out there who are late learning about the wonder that is Jane's Addiciton and subsequently Porno For Pyros, avoid this album. All the positive reviews are very misleading in my opinion. Anyone who likes the band will of course be curious to hear this album. I don't discourage you. I just want to save you the frustration and disappointment that I experienced with this. I LOVED Jane's in the heyday, and still do, and the first PFP album is killer. This last gasp for PFP was created over a period of a few years while the strung out band members escaped for surfing trips to try to get clean. They didn't have much focus or drive on this one. I have had this cd for years and really WANTED to like it. It's just boring. Tahitian Moon is ok for a few listens...."
3,A little disappointed...,"Despite a few negative reviews, I decided to go with this model. As it turns out, my optimism was misplaced. The fountain looks nice--the colors, the water...but it doesn't sound so great. The humming noise of the pump drowns out the sound of the flowing water. I followed the directions and cleaned all surfaces before setting up the fountain, so I don't think that's the problem. The fountain is just very small, so the water doesn't fall from any significant distance, which means the trickling water noise is faint to begin with and easily overshadowed by the pump. I gave it 3 stars because it does look nice, but my main purpose for purchasing it was for the background ""music,"" hence my disappointment."
4,An unusual card game,"I have over 250 games in my collection. I'm pleased to report that this game is not like any other. It's a little like an auction with strategy and a little chance. It's style of play is unique. Don't let the instructions fool you. Just play it out and you'll understand how easy it really is. I have just played this with adults (2 full games in a row). But, I think age 10 and up through seniors will enjoy this. You can rely on strategy or chance to win. It's helps if you plan ahead and then again, depending on how others play, it may or may not go as planned and that's the fun of it. The cute sheep pictures on the cards lends a little chuckle to the game. The size of the box and cards makes it a good travel game for family and friends."
4,really big,"it is huge maybe too big. i have 60lb female lab, she loves it but nexting gonna stick with lg or xl"
4,"The Great, the silly, and the ugly.","I'd be a liar if I denied that there were some clunkers on here. But there are also some of the best songs Reed has ever written. Hooky Wooky is hillarious and honest. Hold on to Your Emotions is perfect. The title song is brave and beautiful. Some of the silly songs are so silly that they are great. I love this album and I listen to it in my car all the time, but there are several tracks I always skip over."
5,Ten Ways Towards a Simpler Life,"This was a fascinating insight into the ancient Essens, writers of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and how they sought a simpler more peaceful life.The book is a beautiful instruction guide to achieve a life of freedom and happiness."
2,"Ironclads - pretty costumes, bad acting, script, ad technica","Based on a true event, the producer had a good story-line to work with. The movie suffers with the addition of the love triangle and poor acting. Well done uniforms and civilian attire alone does not make it a good movie. The battle scenes are somewhat corny. Technical detail, in many instances, is poor. For instance, the Monitor could only have one canon at a time move out of the port. Several scenes showed both canons protruding - a physical impossibility. Its a shame that this historical event could not have been produced more historically correct."
3,VHS is dead,"Great material but horrible video quality. It appears this was a former library copy. The seller did make a refund but not the shipping charge which was nearly as much. They did apologize, and I understand they can't vet every item going out the door. I'll keep looking for a DVD."
4,MY FATHER'S VOICE - WORTH THE READ,"Even if you're not a Bonanza fan, I think you will enjoy ""My Father's Voice"" I thought the title was due do Lorne Greene's distinguished booming voice, when in truth it had more to do with the fact he had recorded his thoughts on tape for many years in the hopes to write his own story but never got around to it. This book is written by his daughter after his death as she listens to those very tapes and writes a heartfelt tribute to her father. What an amazing adventure he had right up until he became Ben ""Pa"" Cartwright on Bonanza and also named the second best TV father of all time."
2,Not what I expected,"To be honest, I did not like this book. The printing was filled with errors which really irritates me. I expected the book to spend significant time discussing David Koresh and the events which led to the fire at Waco. However this book spend the bulk of its pages discussing everything that happened before David Koresh. It comes off as a very dry read. The history which led up to David Koresh really is not that interesting. The only good points this book receives from me is for the few pages in which Koresh is actually discussed. Pass this book up unless you want to read up on the history of the Seven Day Adventists."
3,"Not totally fantastic, but a few gems........","Okay so the soundtrack wasn't certified platinum or anything, so what!!! Like most people with a pure love of music you look at more than the packing and take the song for what it is....for instance R. Kelly's ""Freak Tonight"" is a cool 'bout to get your freak on song, The Luniz ""Ring My Bell"" is straight comical and on point if you like them, Roger Troutman's ""Chocolate City"" is a classic -period-.....and ""Come Over"" by Sandra St. Victor is the sleeper on this cd that I think would have blown up if it got regular airplay...maybe it even could now. Okay, so I'm sort of biased because I actually liked the cd, but you will too even if it's just to hear H-Town's version of ""Thin Line Between Love & Hate."""
3,Interesting,"I bought this book from the Science Fiction Book Club because I love reading vampire stories. The book was very boring at first, but when I got thru the first 100 pgs. it started to get very good. First, you have Miriam Blaylock, the last vampire of her species,then Paul Ward the ultimate vampire slayer. The story goes back and forth between the two until they come together at her Dance Bar. Then they come together to form a union and concieve a child. The ending totally surprised me and I was glad at the end when Miriam and her friends got away. This book is not as good some other vampire stories, I would like him to write a sequel about Miriam and her son and to see who is more powerful ,Paul Ward slayer, and Miriam Blaylock the ultimate last Vampire of her kind and who will have their son."
5,Another Author's Hit,"Great story about a headstrong,independent woman who captures the heart of a daring ,sexy knight. Exciting action,some humor and of course the developing love between these two wonderful characters."
1,Not Worth the Paper it's Printed On,"To be worthwhile a biography must offer some insight into the person about whom it is written. If what is written is extremely negative that goes double. Martha Stewart is undoubtabley difficult to work for and work with. She is also very, very good at what she does. This book provides no insight whatsoever into what makes Martha Stewart tick. Instead we get story after story of nasty, small mindedness coupled with psycho-babble on how she was abused as a child. This writer has not done his homework he has simply compiled a lot of rotten stories. The real biography of this driven, complex woman is bound to be facinating but this is not it."
2,JERRY OPENHEIMER'S TRUTH ISN'T,"ANYONE WITH ANY INTELLIGENCE OR AN INDEPENDENT MIND WOULD DISGARD JERRY OPPENHEIMER'S BOOK AS WHAT WE USED TO CALL IN MY JOURNALISM CLASS TOO MANY YEARS AGO--YELLOW JOURNALISM. TODAY WE CAN BUY IT AT THE GROCERY STORE WHILE WE WAIT IN LINE TO CHECK OUT.IF YOU ARE A MARTHA STEWART FAN, YOU WILL CERTAINLY QUESTION YOUR LOYALTY. BUT BE NOT AFRAID, ANYONE CAN BE PAINTED AS EVIL BY A WRITER WHO IS OUT TO MAKE A DOLLAR. TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT ANYONE, EVEN JERRY OPPENHEIMER, CAN BE CRUELLA DEVIL.I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO HIS BOOK. BUT IT IS DANGEROUS TO LET A WRITER OUTLINE THE TRUTH FOR ANY OF US. I'VE LEARNED THAT WHAT IS WRITTEN ISN'T NECESSARILY THE TRUTH"
4,Africa Of Old,"This is the book I remember from earlier days. The Africa that existed in a true wild state. Gone now forever. The book brought back ""How It Was"" in vivid and understanding detail."
1,Poor martial artist,"I don't know about the book, but I have seen Sean Flynn compete in person several years ago. Studying Aikido for about 15 years, I can tell that his basics are still not yet firmly grounded. Just based on observation, I can not say I would recommend this book. I was very surprised to see his name on the cover while looking for some literature written by some of the true masters of the art."
4,A Dangerous Novel,"--And that's exactly what I liked about it. Many readers, no doubt missed the themes of desperation and alienation that accompanied a boy's transition into adolescence. In a time where the answer to avoiding another Columbine is a cocktail of ritalin and anti-depressants, ""Tender as Hellfire,"" displays the stark realities of poverty, where the liminal state from child to man becomes (quite literally) a trial by fire. Most striking of all, Meno is able to bring sympathy to his narrator's older brother, whose reaction to his socio-economic-imposed ostracism is pyromania. I call it a dangerous novel, because it dares to tell the story of American ""trailer trash."" Someone had to publish news of their existence; not pretty, but Meno certainly couldn't wait on Hollywood.""Tender as Hellfire"" is an easy read about complex characters, and Meno doesn't pull any punches. Leave your judgments at page one, or stick with PC Oprah books."
2,Lee Oscar Harmonica Holder,"The springs that hold the harmonica in place are extremely tight. The position of the instrument is fixed at a specfic angle that projects slightly upward. I prefer to hold my harmonica downward against my lower lip. This position enables me to get more of the harmonica in my mouth.The elevation between my clavicle and my mouth is also fixed. If it were adjustable, a person with a longer neck like mine might be able to play the harmonica according to the distance between the shoulders and neck> This is a 1 size fits all holder.I will continue to search the internet for a more suitable holder. WD NEIL"
3,Sits too high on off my shoulders,"I must have a shorter neck than most people I just can't seem to get this in a comfortable playing postion. It kinda stays just below my nose at its lowest postion, which makes it difficult to play. It does seem well made, and didn't find it too much a problem to slide the harp in postion in spite of the stiff springs. Might be good for the tall and lean, but not good a good fit for the short and stocky."
3,Some first albums are good,"They were developing their style on this one. I am not disappointed, but I and Love and You will be their classic piece, I am sure."
1,Painful attempt to hide the truth,I honestly couldn't make it through the whole video. I only made it about 3/4 way through. It just takes Obama and paints him as this perfect community organizer. I felt like I knew less about Barack after watching this.
3,"Rarely interesting, a boring attempt to combat the propaganda","A feeble attempt to combat some of the conservative propaganda out there. This breaks no new ground and serves almost no other purpose.Of interest are some of the early clips, but that's about it. If it were about 1/3 the length it might have been interesting.It focuses entirely on his life as a community organizer, which while formative paints only a partial picture of the man."
1,Smoke and Lies here...no real truth..,"If you really watched this so called documentary through, Obama never should have been elected President, maybe Mayor or Governor of Chicago and cleaned up the neighborhood he lived in. Worst place to live next to California and declining. Housing projects to put poor blacks and whites in projects by the democrats years past FAILED, and the bones of decay are still visible!!California has Hollywood with sunshine and good weather, higher unemployment, high taxes and rising. Actors and news media who favor socialism love to host a disturbing smile from Obama on TV talk shows. Got to love ""Disney""...Walt is dead (he was a republican) family takes over the liberal media to tell YOU who to vote for. Yes we do have Hollywood with all the perversions Clinton and Obama love!Maybe sometime in the future we will elect a ""real Black Man or Latino"" who is in tune with everyones needs! (I put little hope in that)"
1,Poor quality,"This sharpening system is constructed very poorly. From the cheap, loose adjustment screws to the plastic angle adjustment gauge. I would not recommend this product. The stone even had voids in the surface on the fine side. Poor quality all the way around."
1,*Growl*,"3 episodes x $20 = rip-off!This is no reflection on the show (which is awesome), just the way FUNimation has decided to release it. For more information on Vols. 1 & 2, check my review on the Starter Set page."
5,A great book for Hawking fans.,"Kitty Ferguson does a great job in not only showing the biographical issues of Mr. Hawking, but also many of his works. I salute Mrs. Ferguson's ability to write a truly inspiring biographical work of Professor Hawking. This must be in the highest ranks of biographical works ever done on Hawking."
1,Color incorrect,"I believe the shoes were mislabeled. I ordered Gaucho and received Black, even though it was labeled Gaucho. I know there can be some variance in the leather color, but the shoe laces were black, not brown like the photo. Too bad, I loved my older pair of Dr. Martins."
3,Not Steel Toe,"The shoe is great, but it is not a steel toe shoe as advertised. The paperwork said steel toe too, so I do not know what is going on here."
3,Very average; Good laugh at times; Nothing memorable.,"My son had a good laugh. And to be honest, at places so did I.But...The storyline is not very interesting and the screenplay seems like something done to get the movie out because it was too long since the previous ice-age movie. Dialogues are very average and characters are not as strong as you would see in the other movies in this series. It starts on a promising note but gets diluted too soon to keep it memorable.A lot of animated features in the last few years (notably Pixar movies and the Ice-age series), have this tendency that a few minutes into the movie, you forget you are watching an animated production. Continental drift keeps drifting a lot and although is enjoyable and definitely watchable, I would not rate it higher than 3 stars."
1,30 minutes gone....,"I have watched and enjoyed the first 2 movies and thought this would be just as entertaining. Wrong, yanked the Btu-Ray right outa the player after a half hour. Movie was made for the sake of selling tickets."
5,Very funny movie,Our family loved this movie. Very funny and entertaining - even for the grown ups. Probably my favorite of the series.
5,ice age,Its lighthearted and it made us laugh. A very good family movie. would recomend highly to people with children. great
4,Cute....,"It was cute and worth watching with the family. I am not usually a fan of movie #2 or #3, but this was well done."
3,Ice age continental drift,The graphic nice but wasn't funny like the 3rd movie.The graphic nice but wasn't funny like the 3rd movie.
4,Nice Family movie,"My family really liked this movie!!! We highly recommended, this movie is not just for kids, the adults who watched enjoyed as much as the kids."
2,Cliche,"I suppose the target audience for Ice Age: Continental Drift is children who have never seen a movie before. With no frame of reference, they are likely to enjoy this film. As for everyone else, I am not so sure.The writing itself feels as if it has suffered from too many writers and too little direction. There is the overarching natural disaster of continental drift, the inter-family conflict, the pirates, and the love interest. Not one of these is given more than a few minutes for motivation, nor the proper screen-time afterwards to justify their existence in the final script Each conflict is left undeveloped until it is miraculously resolved in the final scene.In all, I would say it is wise to avoid this film if possible."
2,Continental Drift,"I have seen the full movie and enjoyed watching theses snippits. Funny, Intense. Sad. Altogether good and funny for the whole family"
4,Lives up to expectations.,As entertaining as usual. Good family film. Granny was the most entertaining. Wanda Sykes always kills me with her portrayals.
3,Not the Original,While this movie is very kid friendly and there are some good one-liners it doesn't have the magic of the original. Of course this was not to say that it wasn't any good. The interaction of scrat and his nut is always a crowd pleaser.
2,Least favorite of the films-not really necessary,"I like the Ice Age films. NOT love them, like them. Between the first and third films I can not say a favorite out of them, I like them equally.But, I have no problem as saying this 4th film was my least favorite of them.Why was this film necessary? Reused story lines.Disappointing.OK, we see the Peaches character introduced in the 3rd film as a teenager here. Gee, my parents embarrass me, they do not understand me. Can we count how many times in TV shows & movies this storyline has been used?A boring villain. Making 2 groups to follow did NOT help, Manny, Diego & Sid together with Elle, Crash, Eddie & Peaches.What was the storyline about from out of no where we have Sid's family? Where did they come from, a storyline please film makers.There is no need for any more Ice Age films, pretty soon they will be in 1969 with the cast of Men in Black"
4,Great Family Movie,We have all the Ice Age Movies and love them . If you like animated movies buy this one for the whole family.
1,Could not get the movie to stream,No rating - movie did not stream. My daughter could not see the movie on her Kindle HD - wasted $2.99.
2,To anti white for my taste,"This is one of those movies where the producer is trying so hard to be politically correct it spoils the film. The cast of black actors ( in voice only of course), bleeds through the animated characters. Instead of enjoying the film all you hear are that stereo typical ""black speak"" not quite ebonics but that sassy uppity type speach. It is irritating.I think we need some more white characters especially ones with the distinctive voices of the classic films such as Disney. Very black type voices such as eddie murphy work well as a seasoning. When we see the donkey on shrek we smile in anticipation of knowing that we will hear that mamie type voice."
4,very cool,"i found the movie to be witty, fun and full of great humor....the family loved it. we hope there is another ice age movie coming"
5,Parents beware!!!,If you bought this for your kids plan on watching it about 12 times in the next month. I bought it for my nephews and neice for christmas (I have 6 nephews and a neice.) It came in on Dec. 21st and I've already watched it 5 or 6 times. It is really a GREAT movie and will have you laughing even after the 6th time you've seen in two weeks!
3,cute,"i chose this rating because although it was cute , it was not as good as the other ones, i would say wait for this one to be on the free list"
4,Fun for the whole family,"Great movie, and fun for the whole family. This cast has always been great from the first Ice Age, and they haven't lost any steam in this one either."
5,Great family movie.,Loved this at the theater. It will be fun to watch with the family. Scrat is always funny. Good for all ages.
5,fun pic,love the ice age DVDs - hope they continue. The characters are wonderful and the films are good for children.
3,good kids movie,put this on when the kids came over to spend the night- it's a good movie... and if you have seen the series- then you will know what's in store. Others- a band of various animals form a herd of friendship and live together... welcome to kid movies... while i do have to admit- history buffs will be outraged... parents will be happy
4,"Good movie, VERY predictable, but that's not really the point is it.","Practically the same story line as all the others, but the comedy is pretty good, and the squirrel (I just can't get enough of him - funny!)."
4,Fun movie for the whole family...,"Adults and children alike will like this newest installment of Ice Age! It is fun and has a new twist on the series with fresh talent. The overall message of family unity stays consistent with the previous installments, which this mom can appreciate."
5,Review of Ice Age Continental Drift,I believe it to be one of the best of the Ice Age series. My 4 1/2 year old great-great niece watched it for the 1st time and we had to see it again. She really liked Granny and Precious!
4,"Yep, more of the same from the Ice Age crew","It's all good, don't expect much more than a mild influx of the popular pirate theme into the movie you like best, and you don't be disappointed. Definitely worth the watch."
2,Locked Up Half way through,The movie was good but the stream locked up half way through the movie. This has happened to me two out of the last 3 movies I have rented from amazon. It's not my system since I stream Netflix all the time and it has never locked up.
2,"The movie was great, it played smoothly","It played smoothly and i rent it at a good price. The problem? I live in a bilingual home, and we try to teach our children good Spanish, you know, for their own future, but the video does no give language option nor subtitle opcion. Big bummer, netflix let you change the movie language in many of their films."
2,Ice age Pirates? Really?,"Your standard Ice Age fare, the same aging characters. But the story line is getting VERY thin. Somehow there are pirates who maneuver an iceberg around like a ship? Really? An iceberg? The entire logic of why pirates would exist during this time period is stupid. The whole teenage mammoth segment was unnecessary. This is the worst of the series."
4,Fun family movie,Fun movie. Do not like the interaction of the so called cool crowd. I did like the pirate. Choice of voices on new characters are questionable.
3,Good movie but a little scary for my young kids,"I get the humor in this movie but my 2.5 and 5 yer old didn't. They watched it, but we're pretty scared most of the time. I think we'll stick with the first 2 in the series."
