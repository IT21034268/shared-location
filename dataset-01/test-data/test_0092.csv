5,Much better than the movie!!!!,"I was very disappointed with the movie ""after"" I read the book. Yes, I had not seen the movie till Feb of this year. But it pales in comparison the book. A must read for those who love the movie. It gives the characters more depth. Anyway, a must book."
5,"Great book of families, history and crime!","This is a great book on many levels. Firstly it is a fascinating and detailed book of an Italian family living and loving in the land of opportuntity. It is historically accurate, richly detailed, and utterly believable.Secondly it has wonderful characters. The Don himself and his family; the different people from varied circumstances who are driven to ask him favours for whatever reasons; and the people of rural Sicily.Finally it is a great crime story. Who can forget the horse's head in the bed? The shooting in the cafe? The revenge wreaked on a daughter's rapists? This is really powerful stuff, and so well written that you forget the horror of it all.This is a truly great book, of difficult times, driven people and how they evolve into what they are. It is a classic that should be on everyone's reading list."
4,godfather,"arrived in timely fashion. only problem is that it wouldnt play in a regular cd player. I guess b/c its in mp3 format, but seller should have mentioned this"
4,WHAT DID I LEARN?,"I would have given this book a ""10"" if not for two things. One, I didn't clearly see the point of the story. Vito Corleone has a position in his family to get revenge on any yo-yo who wreaks havoc on his family. Period. I don't see how the theme or purpose of the story could be justified (if one exists) being based around The Don's vigiliance. Secondly, it's too aggressive. I hate aggression and it would take a real hardhead not to see the lack of emotion in the carachters. The Don's reaction to the death of Sonny Corleone, however, saved the day. It was entertaining, and a great learining experience about the Italian Mafia. Read it."
5,A Classic,"This book is spectacular! I read it in about 2 days. As I love the both the Godfather films (part I and II), I was worried about the book. But I was not disappointed. The films are even more amazing. The first film is the best adaptation of a book that I have ever seen. The book is complicated, detailed and thrilling. I loved getting to know more about this characters and getting into the head of a mafia chief. I highly recommend it!"
5,New Moon Rising,"It was very intriguing, I felt that it gave a lot of information about the time of the Civil War. I liked the series, how it is about the family and continues their lives."
3,eyelets not very secure,I used suggested tie downs and took great pains to not put much more than one to two pound tension on each tiedownone pulled out and a dozen more have partially torn
5,buckshot the bdi thug hottest album in hiphop music today,buckshot the bdi thug received five stars because the beat on the album so incredible that every song from 1 to 14 is banging for real and he destroy the lyrics over the beats from begining to end but the female mc's of crow hill and sweet medloyee destroy the lyrics on the track which they ripped on the album and everbody must cop this cd for real.
2,Uncomfortable,"I guess the gel works, because it's really bouncy, but the design of the seat kind of does the opposite of what it's attempting with that hole."
4,gal with a country heart,"after recieving the woman in me as a gift i immiditely went looking for other recordings and found the debut albumn that wasn't really known to be out there at the time. when listening to this work of shania's i was bewondered at why no one knew that this was her debut albumn not the woman in me. it's a great cd with lots of great songs like what made you say that, dance with the one that brought you and several others. if you like her most recent contributions to country music then Shania Twain is a must have for anyone who is a country fan at heart."
3,Tassimo Twinings Earl Grey Tea,"The tea made with the pod is too strong for my taste, but we share the first cup and dilute with hot water. I can make at least 2 more cups with the pod that are perfect."
4,Works great,This was just what I was looking for. I had it hooked up and ready to use in around 5 minutes!
3,Needs a little work,"You must buy this book! Why? Because you will find out things you never knew, like that in Britain, ""puke"" means to vomit. ""Piece of cake"" means easy, ""posh"" means high class, ""put a sock in it"" means shut-up. This book is littered with words and phrases that mean exactly the same thing in both American and British English. I e-mailed the author, who responded politely, but basically said the book is just fine as it is. The book is useful for reference and enjoyable for browsing, but is flawed by its inclusion of entries that do not belong. I guess the author just added some unnecessary words to pad the list out to 1000 entries."
4,Keep this little book next to your television,"I bought this little book to help me understand some of the slang that bubbles through the British mini-series, ""Queer as Folk."" (""Snogging"" is kissing; ""Sod off"" is the equivalent of ""Get lost""; ""Cor"" is a mild exclamation, a shortened form of ""God blind me."") Since not every British movie available on DVD is captioned for the deaf, you may want this little volume close at hand when you rent ""Trainspotting,"" ""Snatch,"" ""The Full Monty,"" and other contemporary fast-talking comedies.Written in a very informal style(by a Brit who lived in Texas for two years) and peppered with cartoons, this volume is divided into seven little chapters: one on general slang and chapters on food and drink, clothing, motoring, people (a ""punter"" is a customer...or a better, as in the movie ""Croupier""), household items, and odds and sods (miscellany). Treat yourself to a copy of this amusing book. Keep it by the telly, mute the commercials, and enjoy!"
5,Gourmet cooking on a budget?! Yes!!!,My spouse is a professional gourmet cook who read this book with interest. The conclusion from our family gourmand? This is the perfect book for the home cook desiring to learn professional techniques so they can prepare restaurant quality meals at a fraction of the cost of dining in a fancy eatery.
1,Very Disappointing,"I expected to find a book of recipes and ideas that were encouraging to those truly working with a limited budget in the kitchen. Instead, I found her recipes and thoughts to be more upscale. I was especially disheartened to read of her view of potlucks and how distasteful they are to her. Those of us who are raising a family on limited means, generally look forward to those occasions where we have an opportunity to gather with others and share friendship over food. Overall, I found the book too upscale in opinions and dishes for my tastes."
4,CD-Rs,"Excellent quality CDs that burn/read well every time. Cost is slightly higher than I prefer, but guess that is due to the current economy."
2,Not very scratch resistant.,I bought these after reading reviews that they're the best CD-Rs out there. I don't think the other reviewers actually bought the product. I've used 9 of them since buying them and every one of them has either skipped after a few plays or is easily scratched.
5,Great Price for Quantity,Delivered perfectly. No damage. Great price for the quantity. Will definitely purchase again.
3,jlerbrecht,"The specs for this product - - unlike similar items - - do not identify any qualifications on their use. So be forewarned that the Sony CD Recorder will not write to these discs. The error message is ""Data Disk""."
4,Review for Verbatim CD-R 80MIN 700MB,"So far, I have used 6 of them from the Spindle. I haven't had any problems..."
5,Very practical buy,I've used roughly 20 of these CDs thus far for music and data. The CDs have worked in every disc player I have tried to use and are just as good at the $30 100-pack at Walmart.
2,What's changed?,"I have purchased these exact same CD's (Verbatim 94554) two or three times before, and had absolutely no problems.However, I haven't had the same luck with my latest spindle.I burnt 12 of them, but none of them play in my CD player.This is strange, because I have purchased the exact same CD's before and they always played perfectly.I burnt them with the exact same computer, at the exact same speed, with the exact same software.They do play on my computer, but in my CD player.And my CD player is not the problem, either.So, I don't know what Verbatim did to these CD's, but they simply don't work for me any more.I will be buying another brand."
1,50% failure rate,"Five of the first 10 discs gave me initial write errors. After the third in a row I gave up and returned the lot for refund. All I was doing was making backup copies of my CD music library using Toast.I went back to my dwindling supply of Sony CD-Rs and proceeded to copy 15 discs worth with no trouble at all. I shouldn't have given up on Sony. I have never had trouble with Sony, contrary to the majority of reviews on Amazon. Go figure.Verbatim CD-Rs, IMO, are crap. Avoid at all costs."
3,Verbatim,"Well, I purchased this brand because of the advice given to me by the company I purchased my software from. I don't see this brand being any better than any of the others I have purchased. They all have some that simply don't work when you purchase the larger quantities. (50 or 100)"
1,WARNING to Vista Users!,"Vista will not recognize blank Verbatim brand CDs! My laptop burnt other blank CDs in the past, so when it did not recognize the blank CD I put in, I checked the Vista site, and the message board showed that others had the same problem. I wish I did more research before I bought all of these CD's :( hope this helps someone else!"
3,Case Was Cracked,Discs are fine but one of the four tabs that hold the see-through case to the base of the tower was broken off.
1,"CD's work, but barely","I got these CD's after having read the mediocre reviews, so I knew it was a gamble but I didn't need very many so I figured it might be worth it. Anyway, I started burning and went through all 50 disks before finishing the 21 that I needed to create. The rest of the disks were garbage, but I got what I needed. So if you expect to get all 50 to work, go with a better brand."
5,Best CD-Rs are on the market,"Memorex, Maxell, TDK, HP, and many other disks are behind verbatim in quality. These CD-Rs are very compatible with so many devices, they are not very sensitive to scratches, and rarely fail to burn. They can even be over burned 20-30MB without too much trouble. I have been using Verbatim for years, and these are the best in their great series of disks"
2,94554 WERE High Quality Discs. 97458 ARE NOT SO MUCH,"I am on my third spindle of these blank discs (I listen to a lot of audio books that I download off the computer). When we used to buy other brands, it seemed like every third disc would not record at all. I have not come across a dud yet! Am very happy with these and will purchase more to be sure.(EDITED MAY 16 2011) I wrote this review about the #94554 discs which were great, I went through 4-5 spindles of them. Lately they are not available, but #97458 discs are. These are not so great. They seem to be ""seconds"". I am only halfway through the spindle of 100 and have 10 ""duds"" already!!! This is very disappointing."
4,Best quality for the price,"I've been using Verbatim media for years. The CDRs have a strong rate of being read by many different kinds of players and burn usually without errors. I gave this product 4 stars as I burned a few MP3 CDs and while most turn out great, some have some tracks that aren't read great. Otherwise great value and quality."
5,excellent!!!!!,"THEY R THE BEST , NO PROBLEMS, LUV THEM.......HAPPY NEW YEAR AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL, AND THE PRODUCT MAKERS..........."
5,The only brand i trust!,I never seem to get any coasters with these discs and that's why i love them and would recommend them to anyone!
1,Useless,"This purchase has turned out to be a complete waste of money (and, time at this point). So far, I have not found a single working disc in the whole package. Yes, they're cheap and I guess I got what I paid for. Every single disc results in an error message when try to burn anything on it. At first, I kept chalking it up to having a couple duds, but I still have not found a single good disc in the entire package. Unfortunately, I waited too long and don't think I can do anything about it now. But, I wanted to make sure others don't waste their time and money with these useless discs."
1,DEFECTIVE JUNK,"Purchased this item and was compelled to return it as at LEAST six (6) discs proved to be defective/failed. Undoubtedly, a high percentage of the remaining discs were also defective. So much for quality control. I had heard that Verbatim made quality products. NOT ANY MORE!"
4,Exactly what I ordered!,"The only ""issue"" I had was that it took FOREVER for the item to arrive! The seller sent me a link to review the product before the product even arrived! However, other than that, the item is perfect! The price was just right and I know my students will thoroughly enjoy having the ability to write directly on the map, as needed."
1,I used to adore PTW...,"Poison the Well is a great band. That was my opinion until this album- they will never be the great band that Opposite of December and Distance Only Makes the Heart Grow Fonder were promising them to be. In the same way that Tear From the Red was different from their debut, this takes it to an all new extreme. When I heard this new album, I got really disappointed. It is much softer, and it doesn't have the singer's traditional piercing scream. I would recommend a lot of albums over this one, like any From Autumn to Ashes or Hopesfall, but this album will just disappoint you."
5,Damn Good Album,"For any of you that are poison the well fans, pick up this album. it is a bit differnt from ""tear from the red"",""the opposite of december"" and ""distance makes the heart grow fonder"", but this album really highlights ptw as talented artist. they stay real hard but at the same time it shows them grow and become little more mature. it shows that jeff can sing his butt off too.he can not only scream but really sing.this album show that bands can not only be hardcore but grow in a way that does not change them but makes them better."
5,Interesting reflection on society,"Love Charlize Theron and the roles that she has chosen, including this one. She definitely reflected bits of myself, which was sort of uncomfortable in some ways, but a needed wake up call. Strangely, I started much self-introspection after scoffing at the character throughout the movie. We all need a movie like this, every once in a while."
2,can I have those 2 hours of my life back?,"I didn't think it was funny. I was bored. I just kept thinking what a loser the main character was and how amazingly embarrassing her behavior was. Sorry...I just didn't get much entertainment from this movie. I spent 2 hours watching someone make a total fool out of themselves and hurt everyone and everything around her. This is not a comedy. It is just a bad, sad and boring drama. THERON is better than this."
1,Bad movie- skip it,No redemption. No learning. The character is obviously mentally ill and yet no one seems to want to do anything about it. A waste of time.
1,Can't believe how bad it was,"I thought with the actors in it, it had a chance to be good. Wow, was I wrong. The story is about a spoiled, pretty-girl alcoholic and how she still thinks everybody should love her because of her beauty. It could have been a good story but turned into just another ""I'm a drunk and ruined my life now I'm unhappy"" movie. Not one person in this movie even tells her to get sober and move on with her life. It actually seemed as though they encouraged her to drink more. I saw this movie just a couple of weeks ago and I don't even remember the ending. That's how much it impressed me."
1,Not funny,"What a letdown. Diablo Cody's writing with Juno was so good, but this movie was boring and not funny at all. Patton Oswalt's character and story was just depressing."
1,this movie sucks,"This movie sucks bing tiime. similar to bad teacher in some way, but with a very bad and undeveloped script. Do not waist your money on this charp."
1,Terrible!,"This is one of the worse movies I have ever tried to sit through. I only made it halfway through before I turned it off. Boring, boring, boring. Did I mention it was BORING?! Charlize Theron made another bomb of a movie. She is the female version of Hugh Grant. Thankfully I only spent 1.99 to rent it but that was 1.98 too much!"
1,Waste of time. Lugubrious. Just plain bad.,"Charlize is an amazing actress. This storyline, however, is horrible. It lightly touches on the mental imbalance of a has-been writer with a severe case of narcissism. There isn't enough sustenance in this movie to write a serious review on. It could have easily been culled down into a 5-minute video for a youtube contest. I don't know why Charlize agreed to be part of this DC film."
1,Boring and stupid,"I decided to watch this movie because the DVD box said it's a comedy. It was far from being even close to comedy. It was something depressing, dark, boring, cold and stupid. I couldn't make myself to finish watching it. DVD went right into the garbage. Unfortunately, I lost an hour and I can't get it back. This movie is about a woman who could have a great future, but she decided not to. Instead of making the right choices, she preferred to drink, and live absolutely empty, selfish life. There is nothing funny about it. It's depressing and scary. I was wondering if the screenwriter was high, when he was writing this ""comedy""."
2,Could think of 100 better names,"Don't waste the time watching the full movie. Watch about the first 30 minutes, turn the movie off and you have saved 1 1/2 hours of your life that could be doing something productive. The story line is about as uneventful as any movie I have seen. In case you are still interested here's the whole movie in one sentence: Prom Queen grows up leaves small town, becomes semi-successful, Gets married, Gets divorced, Her first love has a baby, she goes back to hometown to get first love back, all her old friends pity her, someone she doesn't even remember from high school gives her a pep talk and she goes back to the big city. All you have to do is add in Melodrama and a lot of alcohol and bam, that's the movie."
1,Awful,"I've really enjoyed both Reitman and Cody's past films, but this was not only not funny, but was totally repugnant and unwatchable. You know it's bad when you bail during the climax of the film."
1,Waste of time. Slow moving & no purpose...,"I just never found anything redeeming about this movie. There was no purpose in it, it went nowhere and did nothing. I can't even say the ""acting was good""because I didn't get what there was to act in the first place. A waste of time."
1,what?,"This is not entertaining or funny and definitely doesn't tug at your heart strings. If you want to feel uncomfortable for an hour and a half, watch this movie. That is literally the only word to describe this sad excuse for a film. uncomfortable."
3,Sad mostly,It is not a terrible movie. I thought it was going to be more humorous. It was mostly just very sad. Patton Oswalt was great.
1,Super awful,I waited for some sort of climax. It never came. Very disappointed. I normally love Charlize. This movie left a bad taste in my mouth.
1,Worst Movie Ever!!!,"What a waste of money, time and talent. Very ugly stupid movie and why Charlize would choose to do something so ridiculous. Don't waste your time. Horrible movie. Pathetic."
1,Young adult,"This was the most boring, and messed up movie I have seen. I think there were maybe one or two laughs in the entire movie. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Waste of 1:30 minutes of my life,"This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 20 minutes into it I was ready to turn it off, in fact 20 minutes in took a lifetime! The story was stupid and just didn't really have any meaning. I wanted to turn it off and thought...well it's got to get better. Nope totally wrong! I gave it one star because you have to but in my opinion it shouldn't get any stars. I want a refund!! Please don't waste your time or money."
1,"BORING, it wasn't funny at all","Why put a movie under comedy, when it not even funny, I actualy stop watching it because it was soooo boring. I do not know why people said it was sooo good, they lied to me"
4,How to make fools out of every Intelligence service,"Miles Kendig is a retired CIA spy who is dying slowly of boredom. Unable to adjust to his forced retirement after a life living on the edge, he is inspired after a meeting with an old adversary to write his memoirs. That is the last thing his former employers had counted on because Miles knows a lot more about their dirty tricks than they ever imagined - and he knows how to run circles around his hunters when he invites them to try and stop him.This book was written in the 70s during the cold war and was later made into an entertaining movie. Despite the age, the story has held up well. Kendig is not James Bond, but he's not stupid either as he takes both the CIA, KGB and MI5 on a merry chase. This book held me easily to the end of the story, though its not quite the same as movie it easy to see its source in this book."
2,Not what I ordered,"I ordered a different product. When I ordered it the picture was shown. It was in a green package, a single roasted almond crunch bar...it even had a different name from the product I received by mail. I did not return the bars as I did not want to pay for shipping again."
5,Great,"I love this Granola Bar, there always fresh and crispy. They make great snacks and easy to eat on the run. Plus they are healthy for you too."
5,"A Sensual Experience, not For the Timid if They like Being Timid","El Bakkar is one of the most sensual musicians for Oriental dance. His music is inspiring for the Oriental Dancer and non-Oriental dancer alike. This music almost puts you in a trance if you are not dancing to it. If you are dancing, it makes you a better dancer-- the beat pulls you into it and you become part of the music, a visual instrument. Generally speaking, belly dance music pulls you into its own warp. While there is a great level of skill involved in belly dancing, an amateur can pick up to this music and with a scarf set her husband on fire or dance her blues away.This CD made me think of the quote by Martha Graham, ""Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance. Great dancers are not great because of their technique, they are great because of their passion."" Get this CD and translate you passion in to something memorable if only for yourself."
3,Pat Does Fusion,"For whatever reason, every great jazz guitar player has a period in his career when he deviated from what he did best. Wes Montgomery and George Benson both went Pop later in their careers. Grant Green did some funk before he passed away. Kenny Burrell now sings on his cd's. And Pat Martino did this. I don't know what you call it; 70's fusion I guess. But I think you can love and respect Pat as the guitar god that he is, and still not be able to listen to this cd. I know I couldn't!"
3,Great fun but be careful!,"My daughter loved her Baby Einstein jumper. Notice I say ""loved"" in the past tense, because she's not allowed in it anymore! At 10 months she got herself out of it!!! She pulled herself forward on the piano and when she put her weight on it--she was able to just tip herself out! It was quite the shock for mommy to look over and see her laughing on the floor. She's not that tall or that big (29"" and 20lbs) so I guess there needs to be an upper limit on the height and weight for this one. However, I wouldn't take back all the fun she had in it until this point. It was well worth the investment."
5,Love It!,I bought the activity jumper at Babies R Us yesterday. My 13 week olddaughter loves the frog & the piano. I have it set on the lowest level & her feet touch the floor. Easy to assemble. I would highly recommend it.
4,How to Dry Foods,Very good book with lots of ideas and will have a go with drying once the summer products arrive.
4,Stern is one hip cat!,"Mike Stern has solidified himself in the top echelon of jazz/blues/fusion guitarists. Who Let the Cats Out is a varied disc that shows off what he can do when supported by a top notch band, each with something to add. Mike knows how to vary the mix enough so that he doesn't become predictable.. there is always an edge of newness to his playing and this album doesn't disappoint. While I would not hold out ""Who Let the Cats Out"" as the quintessential Stern recording, it surely belongs in your collection of you appreciate his styling, chops, and musicality."
5,Great Jazz guitar CD,"I don't buy alot of guitar instrumental CDs. In fact, I only bought two in thelast 12 months.... this and Frampton's Fingerprints.Mike Stern, after having heard clips over the years and owning his ""Standards"" CD, is as fresh and new-sounding as he is honed on his style he has played for decades. Unlike some straight-up jazz players, Mike liberally blends blues and rock (inflections only, but effective) into his playing. And I LOVE the tone!!!!!!BUY IT!!! You will not be disappointed!"
2,Competent but pretty dry,"A somewhat stingy ""complete body massage"" due to the author's painstaking avoidance of anything remotely sensual. Massage without much real feeling."
5,Great!,"Clever, moving poetry. Good collection. That's all. Done. Okay, guys. Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye!Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye...."
4,Alternative rock that's refreshing & cool,"The unique vocals and imaginative tunes make up this very cool album. I think Dolores O'Riordan's voice goes well with the music here. On their later albums, her yodelling tends to get a bit grating sometimes but here it's just right. This is definitely a good addition to my CD collection."
5,Cran-tastic!,"I just re-discovered this disk (and at not a bad price from Amazon, I may add...) and I must say, this record is just as fresh now as it was when I first heard it twelve years ago. I was instantly catapulted back to the days of my youth, and I can tell you after all this time, this music is Timeless. Delores O'Riordan's vocals were extremely ahead of her time, and they still make sense today. You can hear her tortured spectrum of emotions, from euphoric happiness to crippling pain, and isolation. ""Everyone Else....."" is an incredibly intense cry of the soul, and It's the PERFECT introduction to the band. Crantastic Phunk."
2,Immitating a fellow Irish,"Cranberries' style of music is leaning towards alternative music heavily coated with pop genre. But Dolores' style of singing is a desperate attempt to immitate fellow Irish artist Sinead O'Connor who was even more popular 10 years before Cranberries hit the airwaves. I have heard their Unplugged version of Linger and Zombie where Dolores was badly struggling to hit the right note. It's sad to hear artists who can't sing well their own song just like Janie Lane of Warrant during his last gig with the band.For me this band is a one hit wonder who can record albums after spending 200hrs recording each song and requires a dozen of sound engineers to make her voice sound better. In fairness, songs from this album that were played in radion stations are the only songs where you get your money's worth."
3,A toss-up...,"Let's see here. On one hand, this has the two best Cranberries songs ever, ""Dreams,"" and ""Linger"". On the other, the rest of the album is pretty bland, and there isn't much that's explorative or different here. Not bad if you like this, but check out The Sundays classic ""Reading, Writing, And Arithmetic"" instead for the real deal."
4,"What it lacks in Lyrics, it makes up for in Great Chops","Cesar Rosas' ripping guitar work and excellent combos with Flaco and others save this cd, which is semi-weak in the lyrics on some songs, pretty hooky on others. His energy cannot be denied, and his voice is one of those things you wish you could lock into your brain for attitude alone. A most interesting mix of blues, traditional street Mexican and who knows what else styles. Just wish I bought into the words a little more."
4,Great roots music CD,"Rosas steps out in front on this CD with great songwriting, hot guitar work and powerful singing. Very much like the early Lobos sound. I pulled this out to play the other day and had forgotten how good it was. Was curious to read the other reviews. If you like the bluesy, rootsy side of Los Lobos, check it out. There's some tex-mex and norteno too, and a nod in the direction of New Orleans, but mostly R&B in the style of ""Don't Worry Baby."" Lyrically the CD doesn't stray far from the ""she done me wrong"" blues tradition - I think David Hidalgo may be the stronger lyricist of the two, but it's got plenty of grit."
4,"Finally, a Los Lobo's blues-rock CD","I have heard of Los Lobo's, but wished that they turned more toward the blues-rock sound. Well, with Cesar's debut I got my wish. From ""You've Got To Lose"" to ""Soul Disguise"", Cesar plays with intensity that is equal to other guitarist's (most notably Jimmie Vaughan), and his singing is along the lines of Billy Gibbons. Believe or not, you will enjoy this impressive debut."
1,Slow cat,"I would have liked to have had the size specified before I bought this sign, as I wanted it to put on the road to remind people to slow down for cats crossing. Apart from that, it looks like a lovely sign, but it is over a month since I ordered it, and it feels like it was ordered so long ago I have given up on it.It hasn't arrived yet."
2,buy the old model if they have one.,"Used to have the old model, broken down after over 10 years. Recently model only last for a few month, a replacement has the same problem.hb"
1,Flowbee Haircutting System,I got my Flowbee in 1994. I use it on and off for 3-4 years at a time. I stop because I need to order new blades. I never did and I would start using it again. I looked up on line to see about ordering new blades. It says the blades come with 4 springs also. I do not have springs with mine so I e-mailed them to see if the new blades would work on mine. It took them several days to answer yes. I e-mailed them back to make sure since because I did not have springs with mine. Again after several days they said all the units have springs. I e-mailed back told them mine is 18 yrs old and he might not have been with the company that long. After several days I was told to throw away the springs. I emailed back to see if I could get my money back if the blades do not fit. It has been 3 weeks and I have not heard from them. They don't have the best customer service.
5,Great recipes from many cultures,Fondue deserves a comeback and this book is a great way to get some great ideas for many different occasions. Many different forms of fondue are covered and my family really loves the dessert fondue with the melted Toblerone bars. Yummm
5,"Finally, hose that can withstand me.","I am notorious for getting a run in my hose the first time I put them on. Even when I make sure to check my nails for sharp parts I always seem to miss something and the hose snags on them and runs. Not these!I was able to put them on and even be a little rough with them while tugging them up. The shimmer effect is nice and subtle, so you won't look like a little girl with a sparkle addiction."
2,So so,It is not sheer pantyhose. Looks thick and color is not right as what I was thinking. Don't like it very much.
3,"Everest: Mountain of Dreams, Mountain of Doom","The subject fascinates me. Interesting, but not as intense as;Everest, the Death Zone; and ;Everest, the Death Zone; was not nearlyas good as David Breshears' IMAX movie about Everest.There were some very interesting interviews with various climbers about Everest. The discussions about Hillary's efforts to help the people of Nepal to improve their quality of life was especially commendable, although that portion of the DVD was made in 1985. I would have liked an update about those projects. Before, I viewed the additional(bonus) items, I felt somewhat ripped off because I had thought I purchased a 1985 video. (The description gave the impression that this was a DVD with all new material.) However, those bonus items were more recent and made the DVD worthwhile."
2,Too many mistakes,"Rather coplete book but-alas-full of mistakes in entries concerning German and Austrian porcelain.Take for example the Meissen porcelain:the authors put together in one large pile Meissen proper,Thieme factory,Fr.Hirsch,Helena Wolfsohn and other factories,though these are absolutely different things.The authors should make a bit of research before starting the project:What amazes me is that this is the 46th edition of the book and nobody ever corrected those mistakes."
2,Spirit Trap,"This is a B movie. It wasnt bad, but the one redeeming value of it was that Billie Piper was in it which is the reason I ordered it in the first place. That being said, I am satisfied with my order."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This movie is a first for me! ...ya see I have never been so bored during a horror movie, that I actually fell asleep. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen and when it did, I didn't care at all! This movie was SO bad, that I don't think the actors were interested in it."
4,what's new scooby doo vol.6,sorry that it took so long to review this my computer has been down for awhile. both my daughter and i like this
5,Great Compilation,"It's nice to be able to pick up a cd with a really good jazz selection for that relaxed mood. Even better, to pick one up where I don't already have several of the selections on other cds.The producer of this cd has shown excellent taste both in musical and artist selection.My favorite cuts are ""That's All There Is To Love"" with Donald Byrd sounding very much like Miles Davis, ""Lost"", and ""You Don't Know What Love Is"". ""Sunny"" and ""'Round Midnight"" are also very good.If you like good relaxed jazz or if you like to sample some artists with whom you are not familiar, or a good bunch of standards, you will probably enjoy this cd."
5,Great Solution for Analog Audio Splitting,These things work great for multi-splitting analog signals. More splits - less wires and connectors. No more fumbling around and keeping track of connectors and wires.
3,A little tricky,"You can do a great deal with this software--some of it obviously useful, some of it less so--and there are clear, succinct explanations of legal issues involved in the decisions you have to make. Moving in and out of your existing documents is tricky, though; there aren't automatic prompts to save, and it would be easy to accidentally save over an existing document. It can be hard to get back into saved documents from the document list, too."
5,Old but still good,In 1972 I joined Weight Watchers. Over the years their food program has gotten more liberal and it's a little confusing for me. Their old program is easier to follow and I do better without the goodies. So I'm thrilled to have the older instructions.
5,Great Book!!,This book was informative and encouraging and I recommend it to anyone interested in the Pampered Chef opportunity.
3,"`The Universe Always Has A Plan Zack""","I can't believe I'm saying this but I must. I enjoyed watching `Employee of the Month' starring Dane Cook and the infamous Jessica Simpson in this light-hearted comedy/romance about finding love and selling in bulk. I didn't intend to watch this film because I thought it was going to be yet another vehicle for Miss Simpson to giggle and jiggle her way to the top of the Hollywood food chain. However I was eventually swayed at my daughters insistance and agreed to a viewing.It definitely was not what I expected. Dane Cook was quite enjoyable in the part of Zack, box boy at the local Super-Club mega store and Jessica Simpson played it straight and somewhat subdued in her role as Amy, the stores new cashier.Obviously there's nothing deep or profound here, just good, clean fun that the whole family can enjoy. Watch and see who's the greatest cashier of them all!"
3,Flat Out Smokin'!,"All right -- just shut up! This is not Schindlers List you morons. It's a light comedy, just bordering on dumb, but with far more heart than any Will Farrell extravaganza.Jessica Simpson is flat out smokin', so her bright, ah smile is all a man needs for fine viewing. But maybe you're not man enough for Jessica; okay, so you got that problem, hey, nothing wrong wit that."
3,Not bad,This movie wasn't bad. It had its funny parts. But some parts seem a little stupid. I think Jessica Simpson did a good job with her acting. Never seen a movie with her in it before.
2,I felt bad for Vince....,"Dane Cook stars as Zack Bradley a slacker who, after reading the personnel file of a beautiful new checkout clerk (Amy) discovers she only dates 'employees of the year.' Because of this, he decides to try try for the title and beat out lead clerk Vince.This movie started out funny, but I soon found myself annoyed by Zack Bradley's character. I felt his motivation for wanting to win, and his change from slacker to star employee unconvincing. Zack changes to impress a girl, not because he wants to be star clerk or has truly changed. I also felt he was a bit mean. The ending was particularly bad. Poor Vince.2.5 stars. Funny beginning but the mean put-down humor got old after a while. Also, I felt bad for Vince."
2,2 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:Employee of the Month is a sophomoric attempt at comedy that misses the pretty large satiric target of Costco-like stores in favor of formulaic romance and dwarf jokes: stay far away.
5,the firt song is off the hook,yo this is the best gangsta pat cd ever. the first song is so tigh you just wanna dance and nod your head to the shh-tuff. get it quick
5,Go get dis cd mayne!,"Yeah dis cd is bangin everywhere u go. If I were yall, I would have got tha cd when it first came out. I go to school puttin fear in those fools thumpin gansta beats."
4,oh granddaddies of heavy rock I love ya!,"oh I love ya Grand daddy of heavy rock! I love ya! I really love ya! your music had grown up with my same roots during my childhood! I coud not ever forget the Deep purple style of classic hard rock. It doesn't matter whether they were Mark II, III, IV, V, VI, VII with past time members or current members of the band such as David Coverdale, Glenn Hughes, Ian Gillan, Blackmore, Bolin, Lord, Paice, Morse, Glover, and teh current Keyboarder Don Airey....you set my heart on fire everytime I listen to you all!"
5,Great jeans!,"My 7-year-old was constantly putting holes in the knees of his jeans because he plays so hard. These jeans are reinforced exactly where he needs it, and they are also a great value."
1,Not recommended,"I was very disappointed with this filter. It was not as described, since it DOES cover the controls on my 19 inch monitor, and it was actually very reflective, it seemed to bother my eyes more than not having a filter at all. The company that sold it (antonline.com) refused to refund the total cost of the item when I returned it, charging me a $10.00 restocking fee, which is outrageous. It is too expensive for what you get, and not worth all the trouble."
4,I love this watch!,"I would give it five stars except three things:1) I agree with the gentleman who said that the difference between 15 and 50, 13 and 30, etc. is nonexistent.2) The second is that I found it very difficult to press the button for the dates.3) The third is that it totally died after a bit over a year and a half. I thought it was just a battery thing, but a new battery to not help. But I love this watch! I bought a replacement that I HATEDtsame brand), so I have since ordered a replacement of this model . It is great, particularly for those like me who are legally blind."
2,A lot of sunflower and little seed - like potato chips for your bird but a good filler for treat time,"I like to give my birds a good fruit/nut and small seed filler for treats - I had to pick out the peanuts in shell - I never feed peanuts to my birds, but there weren't a lot of those anyway. Not a lot of larger nuts period - mostly sunflower and safflower seed - some pepitos and other nuts scattered in but really a lot of just the filler seed in there. This would NOT be something I would feed to any hookbill (parrot) as a meal - it's like feeding a 5 year old child potato chips - all fat and no real protein. Other than the scattered bigger nuts, it's not much different than what you feed outside birds."
5,"As others say, great for the price.","Hard to fault these since they end up costing less than what I spend for a single lunch. Not for serious listening, of course, but adequate. Only issue I have is that the left speaker wants to fall over backward when touched or nudged. No biggie & happy with the purchase."
3,Nice little speakers,"They're adequate. And for the price, I'd say worth it if you're just needing speakers with a volume adjustment on them, and a plug for earphones. I do medical transcription, and I wanted both of those things for an affordable price. These work great. They aren't what I'd call fabulous speakers, but they're adequate, low profile, and accomplish what I needed them for."
2,You get what you pay for.,"These speakers initially sounded average at best. Average highs, midrange and a weak bass. The price was good and I needed them for a limited time (currently deployed). I was surpised when the lows suddenly became distorted after two days. They were used at low volumes with no heavy bottom end music. I got what I payed for."
5,Great product for a great price,"I'm really, really happy with these speakers. For such little speakers, they're almost as loud as my home stereo and the sound quality is nearly as good. I first bought them on sale for my mom's computer, because she doesn't listen to music or watch videos, so I thought if they sounded tinny it wouldn't really matter. But I was so impressed I bought some for myself. They come with an AC adapter (they don't run on batteries), a large power button, a volume control, and a place to plug in your earphones on the front. I'm actually listening to some Benny More right now, and the bass is coming through really nice."
2,Chris Isa,"Instead of Mr. Tellinger letting the evidence speak for itself, he speaks for the evidence. Which grossly invalidates his theories. His findings are speculative at the most. Also, his sarcasm lends an unfortunate diservice to his efforts. Tellinger, vehemently declares his speculations as if his findings are facts. He unfortunately isn't certain of any of his work. I am sad to say it is merely a work of conjecture."
2,Slave species of God,I eagerly awaited this title... and usually I like books that give historical facts as back up. But I have to say that I got bored after the first few chapters...so I did dive into chapter 16 as he'd suggested (where his whole hypothesis supposedly comes together) but I'm afraid I didn't find that inspiring enough to continue reading.
5,Folk-rock trio,"Sound of their music is similar to 10,000 Maniacs, although there is contrast because the earlier group had (has) one female lead and Hank Dogs feature the harmonies of two women. Guitar playing sounds at some points like ""Bucket of Rain"" on Dylan's ""Blood On The Tracks"". Consistently excellent."
5,THIS BOOK ROCKS!!!!!! GET IT!!!!,"This book is the best! If you love the T.v. show, YOU'LL LOVE THE MANGA 10 TIMES MORE!!! It's an AWESOME book for anybody! I just KNOW you'll love it!"
3,OK,"This is about an heiress who goes to Paris and gets into an upper class social circle, returns to England to help with the suffrage movement and then goes back to Paris. I gave it a mediocre 3 stars because it's a mediocre book- the writing is OK, the lead character isn't all that interesting, and I doubt that I'll ever read it again."
1,assmbly of battery,The compass directions called for opening the compass to install the battery provided. Try as I might I could not open the devise. I returned it and got a prompt refund.
4,"Good CD, with a few super cuts.","I heard only of Mark Murphy slightly; but this CD made me a big fan. Afew cuts are super-""Miss You Mr. Mercer"",""The Best Thing for You"" and ""The Bad and the Beautiful.""He might be a better jazz singer than Torme. A super buy!"
3,"not the best,not the worst","I am interested in this subject matter and this does provide a lot of information,but not a lot of depth into any one person or entity."
3,Broad and thin,Coleman covers most of the popular crptids here but in little depth.If you're really interested in the subject I'd recommend any books by Shuker or of course Heuvelmans.
1,Size of envelope is not as advertised,"The description of the envelope states the envelope is 9.8X 9. It is in fact 7.25X8. It is the correct size to hold a CD but not the size indicated. I had to return the item as it was too small. The material seems good and plastically (would be water resistent) but, the air pockets are not too deep. It will provide some cushioning but not a lot of protection if you are mailing heavy items."
4,Nice movie,"I liked this movie, it was a little slow but had a good story line and was also sad. It was good enough to at least watch once"
3,OK,"This movie was pretty decent. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll buy because while it had good moments, it didn't really follow through.I will say this: they didn't follow the typical, done-to-death method of storytelling where something extremely tragic happens and that's the most important part of the film. I'd say the focus was more on the positive side of things."
5,Works surprisingly well,"Very rarely do I give a product 5 stars, but this one definitely earned it. Simple product but a great idea. We picked up about 15 bags of leaves in less than an hour. The same job last year took us twice as long. These are big enough to get a large volume of leaves but small enough so that you can still fit them into the mouth of a garbage bag. They even have holes so you can hang them up on a nail when not in use. The plastic is thick enough so that it is sturdy, but thin enough so that it's lightweight. The straps have enough play so that you can use the claws with or without gloves. Overall quality product. Definitely worth the money."
2,They Were Back On Top,"`Janie's Got A Gun' is really the only reason to buy this album, the other hit `Love In An Elevator' is a dubious asset at best. The rest of the album is loud unexceptional metal typical of the band at the time. At the time this was considered a great come back album from a band that was a master of the art, however, in retrospect, it seems mere pandering to the sound and the politics of the time. Stick to the seventies stuff, as for `Janie' you can probably get it on a comp"
2,"OK, but not the band I remember","I loved Aerosmith in the 70s. This album is just too cold to be likeable for me.The recording is that 80s big-hair sound (is that Aerosmith or Def Leppard on ""Love In An Elevator?). And it's missing those classic Aerosmith details - the jazzy Joe Perry solos with the little non-pentatonic touches, the deep bottom end, and the classic chromatic riffs. F.I.N.E. is the only song I can give a nod to.I understand the need to change, but I think they took a little too much away from what made them unique and replaced it with ""the norm.""Old fans - you'll probably be disappointed like me."
5,"Comeback? Nope, they CONQUERED","This album was not Aerosmith's ""comeback"" album, it was their crowning jewel, where they showed their musicianship, energy, and determination.Nearly every track spawned an awesome single and I spent many teenage nights rocking out to the entire album.This was Aerosmith's best. Ever."
5,Love this collection of books,I bought them for my daughter for Valentine's Day and she just loves them. The chapters are the right length to read her one each night before bedtime.
3,Very unlike standard Tibbetts fare.,"Long ago I used to listen to Steve Tibbetts albums. Now I listen to his CD's. But this particular duet is missing something. It's not bad. It's very restful and relaxing. Yet most Tibbetts music has a dynamic quality: some pieces wind you up, and some relax you. This entire album relaxes to the point where you may start to wonder: how are the musicians staying awake? But if you are a serious Tibbetts fan, it's worth having."
4,Peridot pendant,I love the pendant. I did put it on a different necklace. The chain that it came with gave me a rash ;(. I have gotten so many compliments on the pendant.
5,a powerful message of women's roles as creators,"Through the experiences of the archetypal 13 Original Clan Mothers, the reader is guided through life's lessons. Writing of the purpose of being a woman, Sams gingerly walks the feminist precipice between woman as a reproductive machine and woman as a meaningful contributor to society. She magically does not lose her balance, successfully making the case for women fulfilling a personal and cosmic biological role as creators, with men assigned the role of helpmate and protector. It becomes painfully clear that the tasks that men and women have traditionally performed have not been so much at fault as has the value placed on them by society and the individuals contained within it. Sams is a competent writer with a gift for description. Unlike many spiritual bestsellers, the reader does not have to overcome the distraction of faulty writing in order to receive her powerful message."
1,Not Another ... - you be the judge,"She sells Lakota Sweat Lodges and Medicine CardsJust like Amylee, she claims to be a member of the ""Wolf Clan teaching lodge"" (this is a big warning sign) She claims her stories were passed down by two Kiowa grandmothers: Cisi Laughing Crow and Berta Broken Bow. She assigns colors to the moons (i.e.) ""Gives Praise Moon"" gets the color purple. Strangely enough, she has created a twelve month moon cycle based on the Julian calender and is completely oblivious to the basic fact that tribal people realize that there are thirteen lunar months. She also promotes what she calls the twelve cycles of truth which are supposed to be Seneca teachings. She claims that the thirteen crystal skulls made popular by Art Bell listeners are part of traditional Native American teachings. She tells the reader to use animal bones to create Kachina dolls and ceremonial bone masks. ..."
4,Review,"I've enjoyed this book although, at times, the writing is dry and uneventful. It is sometimes hard to follow but the information and experience it contains makes up for those slight downfalls."
4,Good for beginners and recreational players.,This book is suitable for beginners and recreational players but those who know basic strategy and count cards will not benefit much from this book...
3,"Great for ""Friends"" album songs, not for much else","I bought it because it was the only way I knew to get copies of the songs from the old ""Friends"" album (movie of same name). Don't care for any of the other songs."
3,Rare Masters - Elton John,"I wasn't so much interested in the CD as a whole - but was looking to complete my CD collection for certain specific songs (""Sick City"", ""Friends"", ""Step Into Christmas"", etc.). There are a lot of songs that are worthy of ""B"" side material on this CD. But I'm okay with that because I have finished my collection off."
2,Promoting racism,"This movie is the worst movie ever. It was funny at first, but there was so many racist jokes that after a while, I just outright offended. It makes all white people look so damn ignorant! It was quit offensive to see how many racist jokes there were, as if they had nothing else to talk about. I am quit disappointed to see Latifah play such an offensive role."
2,Downer of Movie,I've tried really hard to enjoy this movie. But the constant racial jokes really bothered me. It would be one thing if it was done in good taste for example Undercover Brother. But mostly in this movie it was mean-spirited. My only delight in this movie was Steve Martin and occasionally Queen Latifah who was outstanding in Brown Sugar and Chicago was likable but not lovable in this movie.
1,steppin fetchit is rolling over in his grave,"what a piece of sterotyped junk , it was not funny nor was i impressed with the various archtypes in this movie . mel brooks did a better job with satire in his films (but at least made you laugh) this is a racist movie plain and simple. after watching this movie i can see this was for latifah's crossover audience humor white people and black people (who should know better) want to see black people acting in every negative way and white people laughing at our expense.i thought this stuff ended in the 60's, if i can give it zero stars i would ."
4,Humor!,"Steve Martin and Queen Latifah team up in this flick to bring you some great lighthearted entertainment. Martin plays a very uptight lawyer who is divorced and raising two children. Queen plays a convect who desperately needs Martin to take on her case and prove that she is innocent.As the story moves on Queen Latifah moves into Martin's house and the fun begins as Martin and the children learn how to enjoy living again. There is a problem however, as Martin is trying to close a deal with a very uptight wealthy women who would never approve of the happenings in Martin's house.This movie was fun and also made you stop and think about smelling the roses along our life journey. An enjoyable movie.Shirley Johnson"
2,Ahh,"Cute movie, I guess, but not the greatest. What's a rack? Lol, that had to be the best line in the movie, well it's a country son. It wasn't my favorite, but eh, someone else might enjoy it."
4,I'm not sure on this one,"I'm giving it 4 stars for being funny but I found this movie to be extremely racist. I'm getting tired of white people being portrayed as racist, bigoted morons. Every white person in this movie is a moron. And all but a few are racist. Betty White hates everybody who isn't white and heterosexual. Racial jokes can be funny and they are in this movie but I just don't think it's fair to stereotype white people this way. We're not all stupid and bigots."
5,Hilarious!!,This movie was hilarious!! It made me laugh until I cried. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to have a good laugh.
3,"Interesting, if you like the topic",The product was received in excellent condition in a Manila envelope. The product was listed as new condition as it was except for writing on the cover.. I'm not sure if it is in buy back condition at any book stores or universities. The price was very well priced compared to other places that I checked out before purchasing this one.
4,Interesting new stuff from Brazil,"Good-natured, tropicalia-tinged rock'n'reggae from Sao Paulo... There's a wide range of styles on here, from bouncy alt-pop and ska to funky spy-jazz retro (particularly on ""Vozes,"" one of the album's highlights...) This gets a little goofy in places, but mostly it's pretty solid, with nice, dubby production. If you want to sample some of the new indie-oriented rock coming out of Brazil, this record is worth checking out."
3,"A short, entertaining piece of seldom heard history","This was a rather entertaining piece of local history. It is not often that one reads about moonshiners. The book details his life before, during and after moonshining. The author also includes many short tales and self written poems, adding additional color and flavor to the story. Included in the text are instructions for building and running a moonshine still. Would have given the book a higher rating, but was a little turned off by some of the preaching. Would recommend it to anyone interested in eastern Oregon history."
1,"Great album, horrible mastering...","Avoid this 1999 're-mastered' CD like the plague!It sounds like it was taken from a 4th or 5th generation tape instead of the studio master. I traded this turkey in for the BGO import.The sound is much better on the BGO two-fer with ""Twice Removed From Yesterday"". Much clearer with less tape-hiss and distortion. Still not ideal, but better than on this overpriced 'new' re-release.Shame on Capitol for not doing better..."
5,Little Bit of Empathy,"I own this on vinyl, cassette, and now the 3rd CD version. I bought it for the BBC sessions and I am extremely happy with those tracks. Great recording and selections. A must for Trower fans, and if you don't have this album...get it for a real music education from one of rock music's greatest trios!"
3,just ok,i thought this would be more of a life based movie. i tend to think that a lot of this was made up with just some true facts. it was just ok.
1,BRILLIANT! MOVING! award material!,"oh yeah, and more ...... this gem elevates ""Surf Nazi's Must Die""to 'High Noon"" status ...... another infinite waste of plastic ....... honed for sad-teens and the 'unusual'.Nothing to redeem this fracture, except infinite pity for the unnamed victims ~ maybe that was the director'snd the amateur cast's 'motivation'.....Oh, so much for Art, Valor and Integrity![Even Ed Wood would frown...]and its not even in wide-screen.......now ....""Salo""......'"
3,He's Not Clowning Around,"Yup, another entry in the direct-to-video-real life serial killer-slasher film franchise. Once again we have a mediocre slasher/suspense flick who's gimmick is to base it's crimes on a real murderer. Try as it may to be a biopic(though how much of it that's truthful is a mystery to me considering I have only basic knowledge of Gacy, but it can't be too accurate), it can't escape it's exploitation elements. Granted, this one takes a little more of a serious approach to it's subject than Ted Bundy did. It looks and plays out like a demented R-rated Lifetime movie. Holton's very good though."
2,Something's fishy here,"The book was OK. Just OK. I skipped around, wasn't terribly impressed. (Could be that it just wasn't my kind of book.) But all five of these 5-star reviews singing the praises of a book by Judy George -- chairman and CEO of Domain, the Boston-based home furnishings chain -- come from, yup, the Boston area. Well. Need I say more? Except that it irks me to no end to see these reviews, which people expect to be honest appraisals and not marketing ploys, skewed like this."
5,Much More Than I Expected,"Everyone has been in a work situation that just didn't feel right and this book seems to have its finger on some reasons why. With the present issues of poor business ethics, I think that this book is important, if not essential. I have yet to read a book that gives such a clear and entertaining picture of why people, relationships and ethics are the most essential piece to running a quality business or organization. I hope that this book finds its way into the hands of supervisors and business owners around the country."
5,Must Read,"This is a wonderful short parable that deals with the realities of the work place; a work enviroment and our day to day lives. It is easy to read, enjoyable and gives the reader a perspective of being there and realizing the real differance behaviors can make. I would recommend this book highly for anyone who works!!This is going to become a NY Times Best seller.I hope to see this soon in our local bookstores."
3,Repeats the same old story,"Very little new here, esp. for the colonial period. Author repeats many stories or views that are inaccurate or myths."
3,"Vanilla chai scent is very strong, not for everyone","I received this lotion as a gift, and was excited about it because I love the scent of chai tea. But the actual lotion has a very strong, very perfume-y scent that doesn't bear a strong resemblance to chai. It was so strong and sweet it actually made me feel kind of ill. The texture of the lotion was fine, but I ended up not being able to wear it due to the scent."
5,Great creative toy!,"These are very creative toys for 7-10 year olds. They can learn how circuits work and make lights, bells and whistles go off."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"1've tried a number of laser sights and all of them so far have 2 ajustment screws. This one has 4 scews. I spent hours loosening and tightening them and finally gave up. The other laser sights I tried have a spring on the opposit side so you only need 2 screws. The best I've been able get this one is about 3"" low and 3"" to the right at 25 feet."
2,Cheap Product,I mounted this sight on my Mossberg 500 Cruiser. After I fired about 100 rounds the sight stopped working. I would mount this laser on low caliber firearms only...
3,I've seen better,"This laser sight would probably be more appropriate for airsoft/ pellet guns. The recoil on my 40 cal. kept turning off the laser and I had to nudge it with my finger every time I fired to turn it back on. It has 4-way adjustable aiming, which is good - but it tended to not stay in place after a magazine or 2 of firing. By the way, this sight will NOT fit on a sub-compact gun like an XD-SC or similar sized glock. I've seen better sights than this - but it IS only $20. You get what you pay for."
4,"For the money, I bought 6 of these!","This laser actually works, but the adjuster screws are very fragile. I stipped the first two I have used trying to get it tight enough to hold it's its line after being shot a few times. So be careful. I bought a few extras cause this thing is disposable and I also gave one to each of my sons. Makes a great little gift for a shooting contest, you don't have to tell them it was about 10 bucks! BTW, the dot disappears on a bright sunny day, probably just like any other cheap laser...."
4,Great for the price,"Install was fairly simple (did not know you had to actually had to take the other side plate off) and when adjusted, seems pretty accurate. have yet to shoot it, however looking down the iron sights it seems to line up. Like i said, good for the 10 bucks"
5,nice for the price,i have a pictany mount on my pistol .. with some small alterations it fit tight and is on target ( close enough )
4,Nice laser,This was a nice product for me i like that it came with the pressure sensor the only thing i dislike is how hard it is to sight in you have to loosen one side then tighten the other to get it to move other then that it was very nice
5,awesome,this is a powerfull laser it may not last through a lot of abuse unknown at this time but it cant be beat for looks and price
2,WTF is up with this laser sight?,"I just got this laser sight and a pressure switch for it yesterday, and it didn't even last the night. I couldn't figure how to adjust the dot to be perfectly aligned with the iron sights on my airsoft gun. It took me like 5-6 hours alone just to try and figure out how to line it up, but not even close to perfectly. To top it off the laser dot was like a big blurry circle, though I think that's just defective, so I'm returning it for an exchange to see if a new one works any better."
3,Decent Laser...Wish it was brighter,"I bought this laser as a training aid (I am a Firearms instructor) and it works fairly well for my intended purpose. The laser is small and (so far) dependable. I don't think I would trust this laser to hold up to any kind of recoil, but since i don't actually shoot with it...it works fine. The laser shows very well indoors (25 Yards projected on a white wall works great) but outdoors leaves a lot to be desired. Even on a cloudy day the laser can't bee seen from even 10 Yards. Like I said in the title...I wish it was brighter, but the price was right."
2,Ehh...,"Only cool for looks. If you want something like this that's actually FUNCTIONAL, you're gonna have to spend more money than this.The recoil of the gun (I had it on a Umarex SA 177) tweaks the ""dialing in"" work out of use.Worthless for reliability, but cool in looks."
3,good product but dosnt fit,"product shipped fast packaged well looks good well made, however it dosnt fit the rail on my gun not the sellers fault but to potential buyers research and make sure it is going to fit your model gun, for the price cant go wrong just the laser is worth it so will probably purchase a mount and use the laser. to the seller if possible add a clearer description on what types of firearms the mount will fit i did a search with my model firearm and your laser and mount came up in the search thats why i made the purchase. but again not giving a negative review just my own personal experience and again mostly to my own error i do reccomend this product but only once you researched a lil to make sure its going to fit your gun."
4,A good buy,A really good buy if no need for magnification. Would have been a five star if mount had an adjustable rail grab. Easy to sight in and stays locked.
2,only good as a training aid,Bought for the cheap price to practice my trigger squeeze by dry firing and watching the gun movement. Fit great on my Sig 229 and decided to try some live fire with it. Switch is fairly easy to activate though it is small and cheap feeling. Aligning it with little set screws was a little time consuming but not imposssible. Worked great for 5 shots with the 40 cal but them it died. If you bang it and wait it would come back on but each shot from that point would casue it to go out. Might be good with a .22 but it can't take the recoil of a large caliber.
5,I Love It Anyway,"I understand why many of the fans/reviewers are disappointed with the ""editing"" job done to this DVD. Lucky for me, I skimmed through the review section of In Livin Color, another FOX television classic. Almost all of the music from the In Livin Color skits were replaced due to licensing- So I was expecting it when I bought Jump Street. It's not fair, and there should have been some sort of indication before ordering. But if you are a true Jump Street fan this shouldn't bother you too much. I was happy to see my favorite stars all together again: Johnny, Holly, Dustin and Peter. Screw the music, but enjoy the show. At least we got it on DVD, something that I never thought would happen."
3,Closed-Captioning (ENG),I own the older brand from Anchor Bay Entertainment and it contains closed-captioning. I do not understand why Mill Creek Entertainment does not copy and include closed-captioning? It is supposed to be free and not to copy the original videos without closed-caption. Most DVD buy-outs from another company does not include closed-captioning. It is bit disappointing!
1,ANOTHER DVD RELEASE RUINED,"21 Jump Street on DVD, like so many DVD releases of classic TV, gets a big FAT F FOR FAILURE. Like many fans, I settled down to watch this with some excitement and a sense of nostalgia. Instead of enjoying it, bit by bit, things started to bug me. Imagine my horror when I discovered that the pilot ISN""T the original version but rather an edited version and the ORIGINAL MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED ON ALL THE EPISODES. And not so much as a disclaimer to be found anywhere on the packaging to acknowledge that fact! BUYER BEWARE."
3,cool for the time period,"Johnny Depp got His Acting game into High gear here.He went on to Become a very Good Actor. Holly robinson Pete got Her Acting game on here as well.she has doen various Projects over the years. this was a pretty good show for it's time period.I dug it more back in the day,but it still holds up fairly well."
5,no fuss and a quick clean,"I have a 15' above ground pool and was not satisfied with the dinky little pump that came with it. It took several days to remove ""cloudiness"" from the water if it removed it at all. This wonderful product did it in a few hours. And when we left for a week of vacation and came back to some green growing in the pool, again it was almost entirely gone overnight. I would highly recommend a sand filter because it removes particulates much faster. With a quick backwash the top layer of sand that trapped the particulates is once again clean. The pump is impressively quiet. I also use a saltwater system and it hooked up to this wonderfully. I purchased the 19"" instead of the smaller size in case we ever purchase a larger above ground pool. You will not regret this purchase. Take time to level the ground where this will be placed. I used some 15"" paving stones and they worked great."
5,Puma Shoes,Puma shoes are awesome!! they are so comfy and very cute! They also have TONS of colors so you have many many style choices.
1,Nickle Plating Peels Off,The nickel plating on the hinges pealed off after a fews months. I would not recommend this product at all.
5,Good and sturdy.,This is definitely a step up from your normal plastic toilet seat. Not real wood like I was hoping but still looks good nonetheless. Can't say anything bad about it.
2,"""Dull, Dull, Dull""","Lady Jane Barlow refused to hear of marriage to the Viscount Rossmere. Such a match would be an insult to the memory of the man whom Jane had loved and tragically lost. Moreover, Jane refused to put herself under the yoke of a lord who clearly thought himself superior to her and everyone else. For his part, Rossmere wanted nothing to do with tying himself down to any one woman, especially not the infuriatingly independent Lady Jane. Much more to his taste was the exquisite Madeline Fulton, who offered a wealth of pleasure without demanding he pay with his freedom. But Jane was hard to resist- almost as hard as resisting a love that neither dared admit....You may like it after all this author has published a number of good books but personally I did not..The ending was a big disappointment."
2,Not her best book,I was very disapointed in this book. I was also left wondering if this is the last of the series?
1,"Pure, unadulterated crap","If it wasn't for the Stargate & related sound effects, I wouldn't know this festering pile of garbage is supposed to be related to SG-1 or Atlantis. The voice acting, stories & animation are terrible. Also, attention to detail, or lack thereof, is baffling for any fan. The Stargate has 7 chevrons instead of 9. All of the chevrons lock, instead of just the top one. The glyphs on the DHD are rotated instead of pressed. I couldn't force myself to watch the entire first disc. I reached my threshold for bile in my throat after 2 episodes. Avoid this series at ALL costs!!!"
3,Stargate Infinity,"I'm not sure I was ready for this one. I thoroughly enjoyed the TV series, and the original Movie version of StarGate but this one left me someplace other than what I was expecting... It's not a bad movie/series, just unexpected content."
2,Stargate Infinity,"I was so excited to be getting this series thinking it was a normal one, I wasn't aware that it is actually an animated series...I haven't opened this to watch it as I did not want animation, for that reason I am probably not the best person to review this.I will be on-selling this one...Cheers...Anne"
3,It's ok... if you're a kid.,"I was not disappointed, only because I read all the reviews. I'm about half way through and I'm determined to finish because I did pay for it. I wanted to see for myself how bad it really was. It's not horrible... if you're a young child. I don't find much entertainment value from it myself, but no less entertaining than the cartoons I used to watch in the 80's like He-Man and Masters of the Universe or She-ra, Princess of Power. Same crap. I could barely notice any connection to the Stargate movies or series. Yes, there's a Stargate. Yes, there's an SGC. That's where the similarities end. I guess I was expecting more than a passing reference to the original. I think the show would've been more successful if they had geared it more towards the fan base of the movie and other 3 series. I guess the old addage really is true, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."""
1,Animated!,"Make sure you know this is animated. Even so, I tried watching it and turned it off after 5 minutes. Horrible drawing and lame story line."
3,Stargat Infinity,The product was ship in good condition and timely. The animation sequences were good and the artwork enjoyable and functional.
2,Thompson's Other Books Are Excellent,"This must have been one of his ""developmental"" writings, done long before Thompson came into his own as an outstanding, ""can't wait for his next one!"" author."
1,Unimaginative and Boring,"This is a very unsatisfying, trite, and stereotype book. The 'Normals' or humans in the story are so poorly portrayed, that not even one of the is close to likable. The dialog is cheesy at best and even though you hope it's going to get better, it never does.Okay, so you have another Vampire who's trying to undo what's been done to him a long time ago. He finds jobs as a doctor at clinics so he can continue his research with hope that one day he'll become human again. How many times are we going to have to go through this? You'd think by now authors could come up with an original idea once in a while."
5,Dynamic Laws of Prosperity,"I don't remember how many copies of this book I have owned, but I normally find somebody who is having a hard time with life and give it to them. It is great reading and has some great affirmations in it."
5,dynamic laws of prosperity,"an excellent book full of positive and helpful information, much needed at this time in my life."
3,It's Pretty Decent,"Even though I love the cartoon series and JETIX and Toon Disney, the books weren't all the great. They're supposed to be best friends, but why do they fight all the time? Irma and Cornelia aren't even friends like they are in the TV series! Also, the dialouge isn't good at all. The other books in the series are good, but this one could have been better, for the first book in the series."
3,Good CD but NOT the Original Alive 1 or 2,"This CD rocks for what it is. I can kinda get into it, so it'll stay in my KISS collection. I've written before that i'm a biased 70's era KISS fan and i dislike the most of the 80's stuff and 90's Revenge. BUT this Live CD rocks in it's own right, i gotta say. It doesn't have that Rock and Roll Garage Spirit of the original Line up, But I dig the Energy on this disc, doctored/overdubbed or not. Again, it by no means has the raw power of the original KISS ALIVE...and I miss Ace on these tracks A LOT, but it's a pretty good CD for what it is."
3,Kiss - 'Alive III' (Mercury),"I give it 3 1/2 stars.A live CD that many of us never thought would see the light of day.'Alive III' was produced by long-time producer Eddie Kramer.A few old fans here and there might be a bit let down,but for the most part,'Alive III' is decent.Total of sixteen cuts,with a running time at 67:26 as there's just four early tunes here,""Deuce"",""Watchin' You"",""Detroit Rock City"" and ""Rock And Roll All Nite"".That's okay.As for myself,I thoroughly enjoyed hearing the later material as well,""Unholy"",""Creatures Of The Night"",""Lick It Up"" and ""I Was Made For Loving You""(after all these years,I'm used to it anyway).No,'Alive III' isn't as great as the first 'Alive' record.But then again,did you really expect it to be?"
2,Very Disappointing!,"I've been a Kiss fan since I was 4 yrs old. In all that time I've never given up on the band (even during the Unmasked & Crazy Nights eras, I even loved The Elder). To be honest I didn't think it was possible for Kiss to make a bad live CD but I was wrong. Don't get me wrong... the song selection is great, the band is great but Alive III is far to over produced. It just sounds fake, like the band played to an empty hall and dubbed in the audience. It sounds so obvious during Paul's abbreviated between song chatter & as previous reviewers said during certain songs. I am totally shoked that something bearing Eddie Kramer's name should be so poorly produced (Who knows maybe it's the ""and Kiss"" part of the production team that was the problem). I like this CD but it just doesn't compare with Alive! or Alive II. As a fan all I can do is hope and pray Alive IV doesn't suffer from the same GLARING flaws."
3,Same old stuff,You can find the same information in any book on the shelves about conspiracies. Just the same stuff worded differently.
1,Slop,"While the book is somewhat entertaining, they should have used a ficticious regiment. This is not right."
3,Cameo,"Cameo is great, but this album overlooks 'Hangin' Downtown'. Cameo did great funk dance songs but also some great funky ballads too."
4,Are You Kidding Me?,"Anyone who gives this book a bad review is not using it in the setting it was meant for. Robert Munsch is a storyteller. His books are best enjoyed in a group setting. I've been reading books outloud and telling stories for many years. This book has stood the test of time. It remains one of my students' favorites. It surprises me how much upper grades enjoy the book, but I especially like using it with children grades Pre-K - 1st. The repetion is delightfully addicting and the whole idea of pulling one over on adults fascinates children. Don't buy this book if Love You Forever is the only Munsch book you've read. This book is more true to Robert Munsch's writing style. If you enjoy Stephanie's Ponytale, Thomas' Snowsuit, or Purple, Green & Yellow then this book is for you!"
3,If Woody did the Graduate,"This is a charming little film with some very nice performances. Bebe Neuwirth in particular is very, very funny. Her scenes with Stanford are what make this one sizzle. Extremely short (77 minutes)so if you blink you may miss something, but those minimal minutes are certainly entertaining. Watch for the restaurant scene - you will laugh and squirm at the same time."
3,A helping of Texas blues,"T-Bone Walker, (B.B. King's idol) is well-represented here with recordings from 1966 and 1970 combined on this Crazy Cajun collection. A real mixed bag with traditional Texas style blues, Chicago sounds, and even a little jazz and funk thrown in (with an occasionally overly dominant organ sound)some of these songs find T-Bone at top form and others present a great no longer at the top of his game, vocally or musically. Some good performances are found throughout (""T-Bone's Way,"" ""Got to Cross the Deep Blue Sea,"" ""Left Home When I was a Kid"") but the collection is uneven in recording quality. Not bad as an intro to the work of this seminal blues great, with more than half the recordings his own compositions and an informative booklet, but definitive recordings will be found elsewhere."
4,a light and sad tale,"As travel adventure this is a walk in the park. Really light stuff. So, why the four stars? What the reader runs in to, is the plight of the indigenous people, caught up in a free market of evangelicals and their ""products."" There must be some law against committing cultural genocide. The native people appear to be lost in their own land, drowning in an alien culture."
2,Soaked?,"I really enjoyed R.T.3 but this expansion pack is very hard to master and has a few bugs of its own. It takes forever to actually make a water fall work and is very frustrating.You have the ability to build rides through terrain now but this to is virtually impossible to accomplish. And often the rides won't function. I receive constant pop-ups saying the ride stations are not long enough for the ride cars, even though you can see the cars sitting in the station. Terrain is a major problem as que lines no longer line up with the ground, forcing you to spend alot of time trying to adjust the surrounding land to the proper height.This expansion pack, if anything, is very frustrating, much more so than the original problems with RT3.In the first 2 version of this game it was very easy to build through mountains and underground, those days are long gone here. Unless you have hours to spend mastering this new stuff, you may want to think twice before you add this pack."
5,Great!,"I really liked this edition, now sure the bad things from the original game are still there but this makes it WAY more fun! You can have water rides and pools and a bunch of new rides and coasters all together. If you are thinking about buying either this expansion or Wild buy this one!"
1,Tycoon 3 Gold Works Better,I couldn't get the game to install.It would say disk not found and Bad version 4.It may be because the Roller coaster 3 game I was adding to is a Scholastic version.The only way I could uninstall the soaked add-onwas to use the Restorefunction on my computer Then uninstall the RCT 3.Other wise you'll have no working game at all.Buy the Roller Coaster tycoon 3 Gold instead.You get a matched set R.C.T. 3 and Soaked all on one disk.It was a little more money but at least it worked.
3,Know nothing review,"I bought all the items that day for my grandson's birthday. They were to be given to him by me and several aunts and uncles. He had sent me a link to each item that he wanted. None of us listened or played any of the items, but he is happy with them."
4,"Good book, okay binding","I got my order shipped within the expected time range. The book was in good condition, just as described. The cover was a bit bent and could tell that it's been used. Overall it isn't too bad, I love the books so I'm glad to have it. My advice is if your looking to order the books, try to find the best used book that's labeled as very good instead of good. Will probably be in better condition and a bit cheeper. Otherwise I'd defiantly recommend it to any Sailor Moon fan."
3,Very Good...........but.................,"I have been a SM fan for quiet awhile. In fact, it was my very first anime! Soon after my love of Sailor Moon began I started liking Tenchi Muyo, Card Captors, Ranma 1/2, and so-on. It's a great series. Though the ""action"" scenes fall flat, it is very funny and the charectors are interesting. My favorite SM's are the ones where they show the scouts just doing everyday things and going to school. ..."
3,Not very inspiring!,"This book contains a nice discussion of the Gödel-theorem and some very nice parts about quantum mechanics. He is right when stating the necessity to find a theory of mind. But in my opinion the author chose a bad ratio of science to pure speculation. On the one side, it contains a lot scientific reasoning, so the reader should have some knowledge of modern physics for example. On the other side, he is just scratching on the surface of the theory, so readers with scientific background will not be satisfied and challenged at all by his descriptions (exceptions mentioned above). The author failed to explain important facts about the biological mind. Shadows of the mind is not very helpful. But it is worth to read this book just for the nice parts! I think it is not the time yet to write books on this subject for the public. Write them for the scientific community."
4,Freud grows branches,"This book, in very easy lay language, describes what would happen if Freud grew branches. Instead of one superego there are many; instead of one id, there are many; only the ego remains in glorious isolation managing the whole crowd of inner beings. Don't get too confused trying to figure out which inner being is talking to you, just get steady with your ""Aware Ego"" and go forward. The book's spiritual base and presumed readership is New Age, so if you're not from that place, it can be very entertaining to listen to the authors chide various New Age failings."
4,CAPTIVATING PERFORMANCES OVERSHADOW SOMEWHAT CLICHED PLOT,"The movie is almost solely carried by Barbara Streisand's scorching performance as a high class hooker wrongly accused of first degree manslaughter. The courtroom scenes are fascinating, and if you love fast witty banter, this is a delight. The subject is weighty (a couple of rants toward the end are also a bit predictably feminist) but thought-provoking, and its rendition into the dramatic screenplay is very, very satisfying. Highly recommended for the discerning viewer."
4,love it,this product is great for under base of powder eye shadow. It stays on forever. To bad it is a limited edition.
1,sophomoric and unfunny,"There's one great essay in this book; the one satirzing Hollywood culture is dead-on. For that, it deserves one star. Aside from that one essay, the others are duds.O'Rourke has a sophomoric humor, trying to shock us with how ""bad"" he is. He regales us with drugs & booze jokes, like a standup leftover from the early 1960s Brat Pack era. He tries too hard to be funny. His ""jokes"" are old and obvious.And there's much phony posturing, for he pulls his punches lest he TRULY offend his PC employers at Rolling Stone.He opposes ""Democratic big government"" because, he says, he likes to speed while driving drunk and fondling big-breasted women. Not the sort of ""scathing"" commentary that would offend Democrats."
1,Karate with Taekwondo Gi?,Mas Oyama's book but with the cover showing a guy with Taekwondo Gi? I reckon it's the biggest mistake in the world. Are you sure it's Oyama's book? I don't think Oyama would be happy about this.
2,Recommended by a friend,"A friend who is as avid a reader of fantasy as I am recommended this book with great enthusiasm. I have to say, I am now a little dubious of his potential to recommend me books in the future.This book is very predictable. In fact, it's so predictable, that I found myself waiting for the twist within a twist to slap me in the face, because the truth behind the lies in the book is so obvious. It never came. Apparently, I was actually supposed to be fooled.If you can't guess the ending of the book and spoil the ""suprise"" for yourself very early on, then who knows - you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, you'll probably feel as if you must have read this somewhere before in a past life... (it can't possibly be that obvious, can it?)"
2,Over-rated.,"PJ Harvey is for the most part bland -- just more overhyped Anglo posturing. Consistently fooling critics on that side of the Atlantic is no accomplishment, but somehow Harvey's got the Yanks' attention too. Props to her for that, I guess."
2,Not her best.,"I adore PJ Harvey. She is a genius,an original, and in a league all her own but Rid Of Me (her second album) left me disappointed. I love all her other albums especially Dry and Stories from the city, stories from the sea but Rid Of Me is not catchy. I don't mind indie albums but this one has no production quality, too under-produced and I can bearly hear her amazing voice and cool lyrics. I only like two songs which are the title-track and Missed. Skip this album, not much to it."
3,"Good, but there could be more","American Music: A Panorama is a cd that has many different tracks from American Music History. I think that it contains many good examples of this, but there could be so many more. Elvis, the artist of the century, has no songs, as well as many other influential artists from the 50's and 60's. The booklet in it also had many errors in track numbers and song title numbers in it. Overall it was good but could be better, and I definitely do not think it was worth the money."
5,Nice looking and strong,"My son did not like wearing his diego helmet. It fit funny and bothered him. He doesn't mind wearing this one. It looks like one for ""big boys' (he's five). It is nice looking and seems like it will protect him very well."
4,When the going gets tough...,"Unlike other reviewers I found this book to represent an interesting insight into where companies need to go if they are to remain competitive. Coveney's analysis is both deep and full of solid anecdotal evidence of the kind that executives should see as representing a genuine reality. The author doesn't gloss over the inherent difficulties attached to bridging the strategy gap and therein lies its weakness. While the book makes solid suggestions about the next step forward, it could have done more to recognise the real issues required to execute against its ideas. In this sense, the notion of CPM, which at one time seemed like a truly great idea, is likely to be relegated to management theory rather than practice."
1,"This book is the ""Howard the Duck"" of fiction","You must NOT remember this. One can only imagine what prompted a sequel to ""Casablanca"" where Louis Rennault and Victor Lazlo are killed off, Richard Blaine is cast as a Jewish mobster on the run, but he and Ilsa still end up MARRIED and returning to Casablanca. The author unfortunately misses the whole point and tenor of the classic motion picture. The only greater disappointment is that a major publishing sanctioned this book. What next, Marie Osmond as Ilsa in the TV movie?"
3,Interesting but not great,"If you are an fan of CASABLANCA as I am you will find AS TIME GOES BY interesting. The author creates a story line that give Ilsa and Rick and past and a future. The problem is that we all remember Ilsa walking off into the foggy night with Victor. Somewhere deep in each persons heart you think of the person that you really loved but whose love was unattainable. Therein lies the beauty of the movie. We all want to hope that someday she and Rick maybe got together or that they spent the rest of their lives with other people but still dreaming of Paris.Although I found the book an interesting read, it just didn't work. You really can't add to someone else's story."
3,Does Rick Blaine really speak Swedish?,"Being an old Casablanca fan it was great to listen to the taped version of this prequel/sequal to see what happened to everyone. For me, however, the book was a disappointment. Can we really believe Rick could check into a Prague hotel and pass for a Swede? What possible reason would British Intelligence have for sending him on the mission in the first place? Was Bullwinkle's Natasha the best European accent Lynn Redgrave could muster? And a daylight ( !) plane pickup ! You really have to suspend disbelief."
4,Entertaining and fun...,"Having seen Casablanca at least two dozen times, As Time Goes By was, for me, fun & nostalgic, giving some of my all-time favorite characters both a past & a future. These may not have been the pasts I would have thought, nor the futures that I would have planned, however, I believe that Michael Walsh put his heart into this effort, keeping to & picking up on the details of the movie dialogue & innuendo, & obviously enjoying himself in the process! This book added dimension to each of the characters -- the sides we witnessed in the film were only in Casablanca, after all, & only over the course of a couple of days. Keeping in mind that this is a light, ""fun"" read, & not something to find subliminal meanings in will only add to your enjoyment. At the same time, this was no small undertaking on the part of the author -- & whenever I want a book to ""keep on going"" as I near the end, I always applaud!"
1,Couldn't go by fast enough!,"I was sadly disappointed by this book. First of all, the Kindle edition had numerous misspellings, format errors, typos and stretches of missing text. That alone made the book difficult to enjoy. At a cost of $12.99 the book ought to be edited correctly, at least. Where to start with the novel? The plot was weak and featured characters and dialogue copied verbatim from the movie and sprinkled throughout. The ""back story"" read like it was written on the back of a paper bag in about 15 minutes. There were a few historical errors as well, but hey, who wants to nit-pick? Put a DNR (Do Not Read) on this one!"
2,End of a beautiful friendship,"This book is similar to the first fifteen minutes of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" in which all of Indy's quirks are explained down to the scar on his chin. Only in this case, it's not funny, or even fun. Walsh gets the characters' flaws correct, but completely misses their strengths -- especially Renault and Victor Laszlo, who seem to be completely different people here. He also removes the nobility from both Rick and Ilsa, making their sacrifices vain in both senses of the word."
1,Not satisfied,I ordered this for Halloween a month in advance. Received the product and was damaged. Send the item back and paid $10 for postage. I did not receive a credit on my credit card nor did not receive a non damage item in the mail before Halloween.After Halloween check my credit card and still did not received my credit. I lost $10 in postage for a product that was defective. I did request a refund for the postage but not receive a refund for the postage. Very disappointed with this company. I paid my hard working money for nothing but disappointment.
4,So Far So Good,"I haven't used it very consistently yet, but what few I have taken seemed to have stopped my hair breakage and that took only about one month. In a few more months I will update my review."
5,Better than the last novel and November Mourns was fantastic!,"Tom Piccirilli's novels just get better and better and The Dead Letters is no exception to that theory. HisownPicSelf drew me into the story with his tragic ""hero"" Eddie Whitt, a man with a dead daughter and an insane self-abusive wife.Being a father myself with a young daughter, I can relate to the wide range of emotions that Eddie goes thru and that makes this novel real for me.Great scenes, bizarre characters, superb dialogue and a nice satisfying sad ending, this novel really had me close to tears several times.Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy, read it and tell me why I'm wrong.Troy"
4,very funny,the best part about this book is that every golfer has rationalized away many of the rules as this book does.
2,Works great but weak steel means the tines bend,"Fantastic product - but the steel is so soft and weak, the tines bend easily with normal use around the house. They need to use a stiffer alloy to make this product."
1,"Poor quality, at best",I just started using this tool and found the forks bending as well as the trowel. I will never endorse or purchase this line of tools again.
4,Total EFA,"Great value and a good product. Has high amounts of Omega 3, 6, and 9 (higher than most others) for a lot less money."
4,"Good movie, bad DVD soundprint","Nothing wrong with the movie: it might be a little weak on character analysis and plot realism, but it is fun and gripping all the way, and soooo 1960s....! The dialogue is the best part ( pure Michel Audiard: you learn French slang a mile a minute!)and both Jean Gabin and Alain Delon sparkle. BUT: the sound of this DVD has a few problem, with background noises at time as if picked up by bits and pieces from different versions of the movie. I paid full price (and above, as it is a foreign item) for this DVD: where is the DVD quality I am entitled to expect ? What a pity..."
1,WORTHLESS!,"After 12 hours of operation I found this unit to be the costliestmistake since my divorce 13 years ago. It is currently 88 deg F outside;the best this unit will do is drop the inside temp to 85 deg F ... in aroom with all windows closed and approxiamtely 260 sq ft. area. Theexhaust hose radiates almost as much heat as the cold air it dischargesinto the room. In other words it appears to be fighting itself. Ireplaced a small (5,000BTU) window unit which would easily bring theindoor temp down 20 deg below the outside ambient. Hard to believe this(supposedly) 12,000BTU gadget works full time for a 3 deg differential.I find it disgusting that anyone could ask $400.00 for such a worthlessitem."
2,Sticky cover,The cover sticks and it is very flimsyNot made up to par for a Medco grillHave had better service out of Meco grill products
2,Is This Price A Mistake???,2 years ago I bought a grill that looks almost like this one at Walmart [...] for $[...] but mine has a side shelf and a front condiment holder and it has >200 sq inches more cooking space on it. Why on earth would anyone spend $[....] on this one? Mine still cooks great meals on it. I love Amazon but you have to shop around before making your final purchases in this economy.
1,Please check your Specs,"Here are the specs you NEED to know.If you don't have EVERY spec up to date,THE GAME WILL NOT RUN!P4 3.0 GHz processor1GB RAM128MB DX9.0c video card (256 reccommended) (nothing prior to ATI X1600 series or GeForce 6600GT)Sound card with DX9.0c with Dolby Digital LiveHD space 7GB!I'll say it again. If you don't even have the minimum requirements, the game WILL NOT EVEN START.UBI soft is not being helpful on the support page. From what people have told me, even with the minimum requirements, they have not liked the game due to ""no save"" feature, the story mode and lack of real difference in weapons. (this is from word of mouth, not my own review) They said nothing about any commercial issues but I will ask.Someday, I will buy a better gaming rig and will be able to play it. Someday. I can play Oblivion and Dark messiah witth very little lag. I don't see why this should be so much more advanced."
5,Bang for buck,"Great graphics, voice, storyline, and fun.4 months later, I still play it from time to time and it's still fun."
5,This game will be AWESOME!!!!!!,depise the fact that this game has been delayed again trust me guys it was a smart move cuz if it came out on may 22nd. Who knows if it will be good or bad and since it got delayed again and im sure they are working on it to make it really great so the reviewers can say this is a great game and not give it a lame score like on those previous titles. I am very patient. This game will rule when it comes to stores on june 13th!!! Can't Wait!!!!
4,Another winner,"Lightly written, but condense in content this book blows apart some of the most pernicious myths of the last few years. Miniter, again marshals his facts with a deftness and fluency that betrays his journalistic background, but with an attention to detail that one only wishes that other commentators on the war on terrorism would take on board.He has traveled across some of the most insalubrious sectors of the planet to lance some basic misconceptions.From proving conclusively that Bin Laden is not suffering from kidney failure, nor was he trained or funded by the US to showing how pointless racial profiling is his targets range across the political spectrum. If the war being waged against western liberal democracies is as much a war about truth than a physical shooting war, then this book is the verbal equivalent of the 51st Highland Division, short tough-minded and destructive."
5,"A transitional album, and a great one at that.","Still using the name Tears for Fears, Roland proves he can make it happen solo on ""Elemental."" The hit single here is the incredibly catchy ""Break It Down Again"", but that's only the beginning. The next best tracks are at the end: ""Power"" is very well done, as is the Beach Boys homage ""Brian Wilson Said"" and ""Goodnight Song"", a tribute to the joys of live performance. Also of note are the great title track, the melodic ""Cold"", and the softer sound of ""Mr. Pessimist."" Every track on this one is great, though, proving that even if he's not burning up the charts with every single, this guy can still make some great music."
2,A STORY YOU'VE SEEN MANY TIMES BEFORE,"Nothing new in this storyline. A couple hikes along ""taboo"" trails. Meets up with ""weird"" family. Winds up in big trouble.Take out the chainsaw and the ""hook"" from TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and you've pretty much got TIMBER FALLS.There ARE a couple of ""jump"" scenes, so it's worth a look just for those.And the acting isn't all that bad.But the story is VERY predictable.Worth a rental, if you like ""B"" horror movies. But that's about it."
4,NICE LOOKING LITTLE JAM!!!,"I didn't know anything about this movie, Till few days ago my friend came with it to my house and we watch together, This is a good rated B movie! Good-looking couple, beautiful in woods & nature. Turn up to insane, scary psychopath intense story! I liked it, pretty good flick, Nicely done & shot. Just ending is corny & unbelievable, leave U all cold thats for SURE!!! But still worth to watch. Put it this way...If u likes WRONG TURN OR WOLF CREEK Style of flicks.. Then U like this . Worth to see at least once!!As I said, Good looking for B rated looks..But ending makes it. C+"
4,"Solid, Simple Horror Flick","A very good, simple horror flick. Not the most original plot, but very enjoyable. Mostly solid acting."
3,"Good, if old fashioned, basics","Whilst the core business ideas of this book are very sound and there is a lot of very useful and specific information I can't help feeling that it's a bit dated. It needs a big revamp to include the whole Internet world. I also felt that the copywriting examples, whilst they probably still work, are representative of the 50s and 60s rather than the 21st century."
2,Not all black wood toilet seats look the same,"It's made of wood, but it's painted gloss black so it looks a lot like plastic. In my opinion it doesn't look nearly as nice as the ones that are stained black so the woodgrain shows. The gloss black surface also exposes fingerprints etc. easily. Other than that, it's a toilet seat that works fine. If solid gloss black and shiny chrome hinges are what you're looking for then I'm sure you'll like it, but it's not what I expected."
4,"UNIQUE, ANGELIC VOICE","Nana Mouskouri's voice to me is immediately recognizable without seeing her singing. It is unique, liquid, strong but NEVER vulgarly loud or screechy. I was amazed to learn once that she has been the most sold of all female vocalists in the world, although I do believe it. This album is gentle in content, certainly no great showcase for Nana...she goes through it as if she were toying with buttons on her blouse! Faithfully familiar and lovely songs from the movies...Michel Legrand great accompaniment and a nice splash of Harry Belafonte. A wonderful little trip through silver screens."
5,torx bits,items added to my tool box for additional uses in the future. Have not needed their use as yet but seem to be a good addition to have as a just in case
5,Neiko Torx Bit Socket Set,If you work on cars you find this is a must this set was in expensive and works very well. I've had to use it many times on my wife's car. German cars use several different sizes of this type of head instead and regular heads.It has paid for it's self ten times over since purchase.
3,too Oracle syntax specific,"Main complaint: the authors use Oracle syntax as basis for book's examples. For those who have time to research SQL equivalents, it is fine. I do not."
4,Not bad,"This text is relatively good book on database systems. In my opinion, it should not be the first book you read on the topic. Also, chapter organization could/should be done other way.Whatever the case, this text revolves around use of UML in database modeling, which is not my favorite tool for this time. I like ERDs and what's more foot-crow ERDs. So, I couldn't find any in this text. But, since authors say that UML is pretty much becoming a standard and many people would agree with them, I will keep my preference for crows-foot ERD to myslef.This text covers topics like: distributed systems, transaction management, and web technologies. These are not the easiest topics and reader should have some previous knowledge of databases before getting to this book."
2,Not too helpful...,"If I hadn't already had some COM knowledge, this book would have been extremely frustrating. I found the topics poorly, and in many cases, inadequately explained. I often had to refer to other books to get the full picture. I would not recommend this book. There are better ones out there."
2,The Other Olive,"I was so disappointed by this movie. We have the original book and we love it. When I saw that there was a movie version I was so excited. I was even more excited to see that Matt Groening was the EP. But when we actually watched it, my heart sank. The movie is nothing like the book. Other than Olive and the fact that she hears something on the radio and sets off to save Christmas, there's little similarity to the original book.On it's own, the movie was OK. The humor is as you would expect from the creator of The Simpsons so if you are a fan of Groening, you will be amused. But if you are hoping for the animated version of your 2-year-old's favorite book, don't waste your money."
1,"Book Lovers, Don't Buy It!","I bought this DVD because my daughters love the Olive book and thought the movie might be a fun treat for them. We were VERY disappointed. This is nothing like the book, other than the fact that it features a little dog named Olive.To answer another reviewer's question, yes I have seen Tom and Jerry cartoons, however I do not let my children watch them. In fact, my kids don't watch any TV at all and earn 1 movie night a week. They were very confused by all the violence and anger in the Olive movie. ""Why did the postman take Olive and the penguin? What was he going to do with them? Why were those people in the restaurant throwing them? Would they really throw them off the roof? Why did Olive lie to that police man? You're not supposed to lie!""This movie may be fun for some adults (though I'm a long time Simpsons fan and still thought this was garbage), but I wouldn't recommend it for any kids I know. Stick with the book, it's a much better option all the way 'round."
1,visionary encounters with departed loved ones,"I was disappointed with Dr Moody's work in this book. I found that he was departing from his usual scientific approach and perspective to something more like a sci-fi description of events that may have been nothing at all to begin with. For readers interested in the topic, I would instead recommend Hello from Heaven."
1,"Sorry, No Mirrors, Please","I was very disappointed, after having just read Life After Life, a book I found particularly uplifting. Since I find mirror gazing, and crystal balls, on the same level as Ouija boards, I didn't find this book especially awe inspiring. As a matter of fact, I struggled to finish it."
1,Useless!!,Please do not buy this product. It does not stick to the windshield at all. Spent $20 to buy it and then $10 for return shipping.
4,"Underrated, and Entertaining","First off, I'm not sure about these people who claim the films isn't true to the Punisher comic book. The movie follows The Punisher Graphic novel closely, with Howard Saint taking the place of the Gnuccis.I also enjoyed the film's nostalgic feel; it's very reminiscent of a Sergio Leone Western, and much of the Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry flicks. It's a welcome change from the endless parade of CGI and mindless explosions of more modern action films.A real winner!"
5,BEST MARVEL MOVIE SINCE SPIDERMAN!!!,"THE PUNISHER... what can I say about this movie. ""The Punisher"" is one of Marvel comic characters I never grew up with but now I wish I did! The movie was the best one since ""Spiderman"" and when it is released I will be the first to buy it!!!"
3,Why Are We Still Being Punished?,"After 2 attempts, no one seems to get this Marvel Comic Book hero. Still, this is much better than the first attempt. Thomas Jane, virtually emotionless, tries to flesh out our hero, but is too cold for us to really care. Travolta again plays an over the top villain, he seems to be auditioning for one of those silly ""Batman"" villains. The action is plentiful, but not at a good clip. The fight scenes are good, but too long, and the love interest that tries to emerge looks phoney and staged. The ending is predictable, but overall is still fun at times, mainly for the Tampa skyline. A hero with so much following deserves a better attempt as a movie. Lets put some heart in these cult comic book heroes. We love these characters and they deserve just as much effort as ""Spiderman"" or ""Batman."" Alright, better than ""Batman."""
3,Comic Book Fun,"There's nothing surprising about this film. It's action packed fun. Even though the movie does have a relationship side, it's still great. Not as horrible as The Hulk."
4,"""The Punisher is definately not Punishement""","Here's is a movie worth seeing. True to the comic, great actine, and great special affects. The creators did a fine job with this film, going up and over my expectations. I have to say that apart from the ongoing ""killathon"" there was a clever little dramatic twist that added much flavor to the movie. Alot of this twist was the music. It made me feel as if I was watcing Lord of the Rings or something. Another part was that he did make new friends, and all they wanted was what was best for him. They did however know what he was going through, and even though they didnt agree with it, they supported himm %100. My only complaint was that the final fight sequence didnt last long enough, but all the other good points covered for that."
3,Punisher Blu-Ray Review,"Okay this was a good movie, not mind blowing, but definitely gritty. In my book, this deserved a sequel and not the train wreck that is ""War Zone"".* * * * * Blu-Ray Review * * * * *This release falls short.LionsGate should have taken the time to polish the film for its HD release. I imagine they probably ported the exact DVD release. The disc has no trailers or extras, just a ""Blu-Ray Experience"" trailer... probably the best looking part of this release.There's grain throughout the film, except in scenes with ample lighting, which is bad. The only scenes with ample lighting are: the family death scene and the car chase... and maybe while in the apartment.I recommend holding out for an ultimate edition (please LionsGate!). But for 12 bucks it's good if you haven't seen it.This is NOT for collectors!!"
2,The Punisher,"the movie took forever to get here an after it got here, I wondered ""what-in-the-world"" possessed me to buy it? really an truly corny and pretty unbelievable story line! John Trovalta has seen many a better acting day than this movie. The best thing I can say for it, is that the movie was in really good shape. Final word....hang on to your money!"
2,Blu-ray is not hi-def,"REVIEW OF BLU-RAY DISK ONLY. This Blu-ray disk may be in the blu-ray format, but the resolution is no better than what you'd expect from a normal, anamorphic DVD. It was actually distracting to me, because I was expecting 1080i resolution, and I got the fuzziness I would have expected from a normal DVD.I fear we may be getting alot this in the early days of Blu-ray and hi-definition TVs. I remember the same thing happening in the early days of DVD about 11 years ago. DVD was capable of much better resolution than a VHS tape, but many DVDs were not significantly sharper than a good VHS tape. Now the same thing is happening with Blu-rays: some of them do not have significantly better resolution than what a good anamorphic DVD would have, and this product is one such disk."
2,2.5 stars this extended version doesn't make It better,Well the title of my review says it all however as a completist in my Super-hero genre of films I would own this version over the original.
2,I waited all this time for THIS!!!!!!!!!,"I am a huge comic book fan and the Punisher is one of my all time favorite characters. I even have his first comic-Spider-Man number 129. There have been a string of comic book character-movies lately that I have despised(Daredevil, Batman and ROBIN,etc).I had high hopes for this film because of the great casting job. However, I was very dissapointed! The Punisher's family is killed and he is having dinner with fatboy and monkey spanker dave. and then he is transporting fire hydrants around time and playing Mcguyver to get Howard Saint to kill his gay colleague. I expected this film to stay true to the comic and be entertaining. There most not nearly as much action , violence, and killing by guns. But, this film made the 1989 Dolph Lungren version of ""the Punisher"" look like Citizen Kane. I snuck into Kill Bill vol.2 for free after this crappy movie just to forgot that I had seen it. Way to go, ARTISAN!sellouts"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY 4/10,Do not waste your money on this piece of crap movie. Horrible! GO TO members.cox.net/hunter21291 for full review.
5,Good start,This is a good start to The Punisher series it tells the story from the beginning. How he loses his family and making him punish anyone who gets in his way.
3,Evil Ones Are Punished!,"The beginning and the end of this movie was very exciting.Themiddle tended to drag.In this movie a retired FBI agent has onemore undercover job. It results in the son of crime warlordJohn Travolta being killed.The FBI agent Frank Castle is inPuerto Rico at a family reunion when thw crime lord gains revengeby killing the entire family of Castle including his wife and son.Castle is severely wounded.He recovers and begins gainingvengance for the killing of his family.It just takes him some time to get untracked.One of the more notable scenes in the film is when former wrestler Kevin Nash attacks Church.It is an exciting battle. Church(the Punisher) attacks the crime lord and all of the members of the organization at the end of the movie.This is an exciting series of events.The actor who plays the Punisher does a reasonably good job.All in all this movie was not as good as ""Hellboy""."
1,GIMME BACK DOLF!!!!,I dont know were to start. It felt like I was watching a cheezy made-for-TV movie! Like I was watching a bad Miami Vice episode or something! I was hoping this movie would have been cool. Even though the first Punisher movie with Dolf wasnt that great either it certainly is better then this. So far the only really GREAT comic book movie Marvel has put out is Spiderman(1&2)Hulk was ok too. PLEASE! I just hope the Fantastic Four is good!
1,oh my god,"This is the worst film I have seen since battlefield earth!it's so laughable you should rent it for the pure comedy factor. Its so cheesy I can't even explain it, enjoy at your own sanity"
1,It looked so good but blowed so much,"This movie is plagued with bad writing, weak action, and worse of all poor attempts at comedy. There are a few good moments in the movie but overall its really nothing special at all. The ""climax"" to the movie can't really be described as exciting. Even if he gets shot he just flinches alittle and keeps shooting. THATS ALL!!! I figured that since It was a rated R film it would get all cool and bloody like blade. Theres blood in it but not enough. This movie is way too weak and filled with many boring unecssary scences."
4,Cool Marvel Comics adaptation; Decent HD presentation,"The Blu-ray disc of THE PUNISHER looks superior to the DVD version, but none of the extras from the DVD are included here.The ""studder"" issue noted by other reviewers is present ONLY when selecting the DTS audio option (which is the default on the menu). To play the movie without any issues, simply choose the DOLBY DIGTIAL audio track and the movie will play back perfectly. This strange issue affects all 4 of the initial Lionsgate titles. Again, to get around it, simply choose the Dolby audio option.Hopefully the Blu-ray camp will begin releasing better discs soon, but for the meantime, THE PUUNISER looks cool in HD."
1,"THE MOVIE ISN'T VERY GOOD, BUT THE BLUE RAY... IS EVEN WORST","That's my second Lionsgate Blue Ray purchase, after T-2; and i was hoping that being a much more recent film, the picture quality would improve more than the highly dissapointing grainy print of the James Cameron's film, but this doesn't happen. I don't know what kind of masters this studio is using, but i don't think you coul call this high definition. If you want to know how to treat a movie in high definition, i recommend you to consult how Disney Studios and 20th Century Fox are doing it. Because for me, this two studios are the two only ones that are bringing high definition into the next level. Even the Sony titles don't look so good as the Touchstone editions."
2,Pretty but disappointing,"I'm a new weaver & really looked forward to getting this book. The scarves are beautiful & the book inspirational, but did I mention I'm a new weaver? It's hard to turn that inspiration into a textile treat without some direction or instruction. The editor states they published the information each scarf designer was comfortable in sharing; a few were very generous, but most shared only the very basic information. All in all, this book was a disappointment and not what I've come to expect from Interweave Press."
3,A Walking Revolution,"The first couple of chapters are a reawakening to the true author of our Declaration of Independence and the great Liberal Concept of Liberty and Rights. Sadly, the book then turns into a strained effort to link Paine to every subsequent left leaning movement without creditable argument and to little purpose in explaining Paine's Promise of America. Popcorn Politics."
2,Well written but biased and flawed argument,"Kaye's prose is solid and I certainly enjoyed the first few chapters on Paine's controversial life. The book, however, takes a turn for the worse when it launches (for half the book!) into a very oversimplified argument that ""liberals"" (of all times, shapes, and persuasions) are the true decendents of Paine's ideology and that conservatives (over and over derided as ""the powers that be"" ""capitalist elites"" etc.) can never truly draw from Paine's legacy. Quite the contrary, Kaye admits that Paine's libertarian tendencies and his disdain for government, contradicting his own argument. An interesting read, but disgustingly biased and as a previous post commented, should be on the shelf with other political polemics. Wouldn't recommend it to an objective student of history looking for a good intro to Paine."
2,"Good Topic, Average Writing","Thomas Paine was a luminary, and one of the (if not the) most forward-thinking of his era. I am sure there is a definitive biography out there, waiting to be written, that will give us the true depth of this man.Unfortunately, this is not it. This book gives little insight that any reader of Paine's works could not have gleaned on his/her own. The writing style tends to the pedantic, with awkward sentences and trite constructions.The book does give a good starting point for a scholar who might be interested in real research into Paine's life.Bottom line - the book is worth reading if you can pick it up in a used bookstore."
5,"The Prince, the Rose, and the Fox","I happened onto THE LITTLE PRINCE in college and read it at a sitting. Since then I've re-read it many times and bought numerous copies for friends. In under a hundred pages, Antoine de St. Exupery managed to beautifully express some tender and profound views and teach the reader some important things about mortality and the proper appreciation of it. The illustrations are wonderful and the text has made this book popular in several languages for over three generations."
5,Bravo to Amazon,"CONGRATULATIONS TO AMAZON: For having ethical, professional book distributors. I received my copy of The Little Prince within a week of my order date. It was in excellent condition. I would definitely order from this bookseller again.I have always received my books long before the projected end date and they have been in excellent condition. In these economic times, and really at any time, it's a pleasure to be able to own books priced reasonably. I am an avid reader and there are some books I'd rather own than borrow from the library. Amazon is my first choice whenever I am on my search.Congratulations again.Nydia FergusonMargate, FL"
3,"Too Many Meanings, Too Much Confusion!","This book, which is made for kids my age, really got my noodle going, but it wasn't exactly enjoyable to read. As it was boring in some ways, the meanings were way too complex and confusing. For instance, one minute they're talking about one thing, then the next they're talking about another. Everything happens so fast, you don't know where you are, what you read, and you end up reading paragraphs over again and again. I wouldn't recommend this book to impaitient people, or who can't understand hidden meanings. But if you're a fast thinker, I suggest that you read this book because you'd love it. But I don't think this book is suitable for kids my age and under, unless they're up to the challange or super smart, because it will just tire them out with trying to figure out what they're reading. Personally, I didn't like this book, but everyone else is a different story."
1,hee hee,"sorry, i just put 1-star to get your attention: so i'll make my message short: this is my FAVORITE book by far, the little prince is sooooo powerful its awe-inspiring; saturated with useful, hopeful, and optimistic messages on life and dealing with others. lastly, this deserves waaayyyy more than 5-stars: in a league of its own..."
5,It's SIMPLY beautiful,"Easy enough for a child, with issues profound enough for a college philosophy professor; easy enough to read if you are sick and tired; worth paying attention to if you are wide awake and vigorous. Somewhere, in this lovely book, you will find yourself."
4,Sweet. Charming. Heartwarming.,There is a reason some books are classics and The Little Prince is a great example of such a book. It's told in a manner that make you feel as if you're reading a diary. The illustrations meld perfectly with the story. The story itself is imaginative and can be read on many different levels. There is something here for all readers. And that to me the measure of a true classic. A book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds.This small unasumming book hides a wealth of discovery.
5,Not too simple ...that's a good thing!,"This is, and with this I agree with one of your other reviewers, a book that should be READ TO kids. Starting probably at around 7 or 8. My kids love it (we're not quite finished.) I have had this book read to me in DUTCH about 30 years ago. Loved it then. Glad that it's still going strong."
3,Oh Well...,"I wanted to love this book and be moved by it. I really did. But I guess I just didn't get it. It was nice and all, and its messages are very meaningful, but the book really didn't move me to think about or feel those messages. Oh well."
2,Unsatisfying,This could quite possibly be the least satisfying book that I have ever read... The extended metaphors are too many and too bothersome to analyze as one is reading this short book. I [don't like] having to figure out exactly what the author is saying as I'm reading. It takes away from the flow of the book.
1,shoddy impersonation of a book,"This book appears to have been printed the day after I ordered it, according to a note on the last page of the text block (says it was ""Made in the USA/Lexington, KY/January 14, 2011""). The illustrations are of horrible quality: they look like they've been through a photocopier 2 or 3 times - and the illustrations are an integral part of this book. details are lost in the poor print quality. the text does not say what translation of this story it is using. I question the legitimacy of this publisher -- ""BN Publishing,"" whose tagline on the back of this book reads ""Improving People's Lifes."" If you cannot present your own slogan in proper English you should not be in the publishing industry. I didn't pay too much - 8 dollars or so - for this book, but I still feel taken for a ride."
4,Little Prince Review,"Here is a good book you should read. It is about a kid who travels to many asteroids and the planet Earth. This book is by Antoine de Saint Exupery. He is a French writer who wrote other books to such as Terre des Homes and Vol de Nuit. The Little Prince is one of greatest books in the world and I truly think you should read this book. This book also teaches you a lesson. It teaches that to gain maturity one must lose his innocence. In the book there is a flower, and even though the flower is vain about herself the Little Prince still takes care of her. It shows how your parents would take care of you even though you do sometimes annoy them. So if you like books about friendship this book is for you."
1,Product Not Received,"This was a gift, but it was never received by the recipient. Amazon apparently has no procedure for this circumstance. The Little Prince has been one of my favorite books."
5,The easiest book to cook from Biba Caggiano.,The recipes are easy to follow and the ingredients are simple and easy to find. The recipes I've tried are all came out delicious.
1,Strange proportions,"I have worn many brands of hooded sweatshirts but this one is shapped strangely. The shooulders are so wide they hang well down my arms, yet the waist is considetably smaller than any other large sweatshirt I have purchased.I am keeping it as it is only for wear arond the house and not worth the effort to return."
2,Partial Wiper,"Installed this on my 1994 Cherokee Sport, and after 2 months it no longer makes complete contact with the window. It only wipes the center and both ends don't make contact with the glass. I would not recommend this brand. I also purchased the 12"" for my 2003 Grand Cherokee and it has the same issues."
2,This Book Doesn't Do It,"I wish that there was a comprehensive Step by Step book on how to install a NT Web Server-a reference that anybody can understand especially those who are taking the Internet into their own hands for the first time. Most of the books that claim to do this are too general in their coverage or are so poorly written they are not worth reading.If you are looking for that detailed aspect, do not buy this book. Besides, it is out of date."
2,2 hours long and 40 minutes of dialogue. Seriously.,"This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The plot just never comes together (apes discover monolith, man discovers monolith, computer goes crazy, man discovers bedroom on the other side of the universe). What is the monolith anyway? And just why did Hal go crazy? I give this movie three stars because Hal is a great bad guy, and I love the scene where he sings ""Daisy"". Very cool special effects, esspecially that psychaelic nebula. Other than those few points, Stanely Kubrick is a sick man. Just watch A Clockwork Orange and The Shining to find out why."
3,A snoozer until Dave is locked out in pod,The movie is pretty boring and I don't know what to make of the ending where the dude has died and gone to a room like prison.
2,Boring!,"I'm an 80's kid. I purchased this movie expecting more but was sadly disapointed. In it's day, the 60's and 70's, this movie may have been extraordinary. Some of the scenes like the video chat between father and daughter were certainly ahead of it's time. Unless you're a fan of this movie, I wouldn't buy this. There are are plenty of other movies more appropriate for you depending on your age."
3,It's over hyped,"The effects are cool, the space scenes and what little dialogue really help the movie. The music adds to the power of the whole film but, what the hell was the point of the movie? I haven't read the book, and haven't seen the sequel yet so i hope answers may be found there. The point is, everyone say's, KUBRICK LEAVES THE VIEWERS PONDERING THE ANSWERS, i'd like to know, what ARE the question's...beside's: WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE MOVIE. If there is no point, and you are just supposed to wonder at the end what you just saw, then it's a good movie, otherwise, skip it. Star Wars is better, it has action, and dosen't stretch for 15 minutes showing apes jumping around going banana's (pun intended).It's a fun fantasy that may put you to sleep, see it, appreciate it, then forget it.Stop calling it a classic. It's trash like this that gets overhyped (Like Harry Potter & Tomb Raider), that turns fun little film into something to hurl by.Like the film, hate the hype."
1,A Masterpiece.??!... please!,"Easily one of the most boring movies ever! It totally sucked! The first half hour of ""human"" apes; what a joke (wow. look how far we've come...yeah.) Don't even waste your time with this crap. Boo."
1,I hated this.,"I hated ""2001:A Space Odyssey"". I don't know why every one says it is so good. I mean it was just some dumb. It was silent. The acting was bad. The story line & plot are dumb. I would not say to see this movie becuase of the fact that it made on scence. The music was okay though.2/10"
1,Boycott this awfull DVD !,"I saw the orginal of this film at the Grumman's Chinese in Cinerama, the first week it showed. This DVD is a ripoff and a travesty, an insult to the original film. It's got a lot to look at:1. Grainy shots (like cheap Kodak camera shots) in the beginning.2. Shimmering and herringbone effects on stars and complex scenes.3. Ghosts. Yep. Somehow they managed to record TV style ghosts onto the disc.4. Werid vertical ""bars"" in the dark shots. In the end shots, these turned green and were more interesting to watch than the film. I have since learned that this is an amateur DVD encoding error.Last, but not least:5. This film, more than any other film on or off this planet, needs to be encoded in proper anamorphic widescreen !Boycott this incredibly bad, amateurish attempt at a DVD. The studio can make another. They can afford more than the $100 it must have taken to make this disc."
4,A Movie You Look At Instead Of Listening To,"This above statement no make no sense to many of you out there,but let me explain. This is my feelings of this film. When watching many different movies it's important that you pay close attention to what you HEAR instead of what you SEE. The dialogue is the most important thing in the movie. Think of the films of Martin Scorsese or Spike Lee. If you miss certain parts of the dialogue you'll be lost for the whole rest of the story. But that's not the case with this masterpiece by Kubrick. There is I believe only 40 minutes of dialogue. So basically your just looking at your screen and watching something you'll never forget. The screenplay done here by Kubrick and Clarke is amazing. This will turn our to be a one of a kind movie you will never forget.Which is all due to the astonishing images projected on screen. Kubrick really out did himself and set a very high standard for others to try and reach. A must for movie fans!"
2,Disappointed with the editing,"THIS IS ABOUT THE REGULAR DVD, NOT THE BLU-RAY VERSION. The scene of the space clipper arriving at the space station, with the Blue Danube Waltz on the soundtrack, is my favorite scene ever in a scifi movie. I was very disappointed to see that on this DVD that scene is cut short. I'm not sure exactly how much is missing, maybe the last minute or so. That was enough to significantly degrade the whole viewing experience for me."
5,Let perspectivism reign,"Watch the movie before you purchase it: if you are astonished, thrilled, etc.--you will watch this movie in the many years to come, for it is truly one of the greatest cinematic experiences if it strikes a chord within you; for those who are angered or unimpressed by it, obviously, don't buy it. This movie is an acquired taste, and for the mentally adventurous; if you aren't open minded in general, this movie is probably not for you. It is a movie that takes effort, one must think while watching it. For those benign souls who wish not to think, PLEASE, don't watch this movie and espouse your nonsensical static opinions. Moreover, for those who do think and have an open mind while watching this movie and believe its crap--cheers to you, at least there has or will have been an attempt. Good luck y'all."
1,boring,"a lot of critics like to say that 2001 a space odyssesy is a good film b/c they feel that this staterment will validate thier position as real critics and b/c the top critics in the game list this as thier favourite movie.for example, the renowned film critic roger ebert puts this film as one of his greatest film. this film receives the highest rating possible from the leonard maltin filmbooks. but the truth is that this film is not good. it is boring, it has no plot whatsoever and all this film is is kubrick showing off and telling everyone how good technically he is.i love kubrick films, but i hated this. there is a scene in this film that shows an astronaut running around in the spaceship at . this scene is cool at first as it shows him running upside down in the spinning spaceship at zero gravity. but when kubrick decides to show this paticuler scene for about 15 minutes with no words, it gets boring. if you want some shut-eye, then this movie is for you. otherwise avoid at all cost."
3,watch out for faulty older discs,"Considering that the movie was made over thirty years ago, I think the image quality is still quite good -- contrary to a few reviewers who seem to compare it to movies made today with state of the art equipment. The only problem that some may experience is that some of the earlier DVD release of this movie (i.e. the one in the black case) has problems reading the second layer of the dual layered disc. Be sure to purchase the disc re-released with the white coloured case."
3,The DVD was a disappointment,"I've always liked 2001, even though I saw it several times and had to read the book before I understood the ending. One of the best things about the movie is its outer space special effects, which were state of the art at the time of its release. I had this movie on VHS, but I bought the DVD wanting the improved visual quality. While the interior scenes shot on a soundstage met this criteria, I found the outer space scenes a disappointment in many instances. In some cases the blackness of space had alternating verticle lines of black and gray. I'd recommend sticking with the VHS version of this movie."
2,Less here than meets the eye.,"I remember well seeing this movie as a teenager. At the time,I thought it was very clever, although nobody knew what it meant.When I saw it again on DVD, from a perspective of being 50 yearsold, I was amazed at how little there was to this pretentiousflick. Oh well."
5,Amazing Transfer,"I was shocked when I put this movie in my Toshiba A-2 720p player and watched it on my Panasonic 42"" plasma. The movie has never looked like this in any of the previous releases. It appears as though a lot of care was put into the Picture and sound for this ""release of releases"". If this is your sort of movie then buy it. The Amazon price is unbeatable. I can order 3 HD titles from Amazon for around the same price for 2 at my local retailer. Buy this and enjoy!"
1,Wow!,"I was really looking forward to viewing this movie in the blu-ray format. I was extremely disappointed in the story line, and overall video was just average."
1,2001 - a total disappointment from amazon,"received DVD, inserted into sony player; disk did not load. inserted into computer; system claimed no disk in drive. inserted in philips DVD player; disk did not load. notified amazon and they sent replacement disk. before i returned original, i inserted new disk in each player only to find that it too failed to be recognized. examined disks and container, was referred to website where i might be able to download software update but, when i went to website, all i got was message from producer which seemed to state that they didn't care if my stuff is obsolete and won't play their junk. both disks returned to amazon."
3,"Great film, terrible DVD.","A classic film, but the digital artifacting on the blacks in this film is a disgrace. This transfer was apparently done from the same source as the notoriously bad 1993 MGM 25th Anniversary laserdisc. The best release of this film on home video is the Criterion laserdisc, either CAV or CLV version. As it stands, this DVD desparately needs a remaster. However, the Arthur C. Clarke talk is very good."
1,2001: a nice idea but a terrible movie,"2001 was a very complex and insightful movie, but it lagged everywhere and just was not very entertaining. Many scenes were excessively long and their added length just showed the same basic material over and over until you just wanted to scream ""OK! I GOT IT! MOVE ON!"" You could have editted at least fourty-five minutes off of the movie and you wouldn't have lost any of the content."
2,I'm afraid I can't watch this ever again Dave!,"This has got to be the slowest movie I have ever seen.This is my first Kubrick film to watch and now I am not even a fan. I couldnt even watch the whole thing because I had things to do and places to go instead of watching a spaceship dock and float for two hours. I think some of you adults think that since I am a kid I dont know classic films. Well I do and this is diffenetly not one. Skip this film please. Dont watch this film. There is only one good thing about it. The visuals. They are spectacular. Way better than the CGI crap we see know in movies like Episode III. Oh yeah one more good thing, one word. HAL. Well more like the voice of HAL. He has a mesmorizing voice that sends chills up your spine. If you really want to see this movie, rent it at all costs!. Trust me, this movie is not a buy."
2,Dated and I try hard to get into it,"Dated is not unkind...This movie is beautifully filmed and given great epic pace to explore every nuance. However, as much as I love the pace and the artistry, I am forced to say I skip huge portions of the entire serving.I don't have five minutes of life to trade for the ""Monkey Scenes"" they are not enjoyable nor are they in some other way (perhaps so subtle) meaningful other than in Kubrick's demented mind. Which I happen to love dearly. But just not in this movie.The good parts are too few and too spread out amongst that which I don't like about the movie. Hanging around and waiting for some cool videography and maybe dialogue is grueling.I love KubrickI don't enjoy this movie.It would be fun to do an ambient music dub over edited portions of the space shots...that I would buy."
4,"Very good, but calling it great is a stretch.","2001 is indeed a movie for the thinking person, which is something we could definitely use much more of. Many people complain about the slowness of many of the scenes, but fail to realize Kubrick did this for a reason. I do indeed find this movie intellectually stimulating to a large extent, but the problem I have is that Kubrick was a little too obscure for my taste. I would have respected this movie much more if he had actually made some clear points and not left so much to the imagination. For example, what in the world is going on with the whole alien concept? What is he trying to say? The answer to that is that he isn't trying to say anything according to interviews I have read. This, I believe, is a weak and ""cop out"" approach. Aside from the movies pitfalls, Kubrick has left us one of the very few movies that actually provoke thought."
5,Excellent Science Fiction,"I saw ""2001"" when it was first released. Excellent film that would not get made in today's entertainment industry. Anyone notice that this film never gets shown on the Science Fiction Channel?"
1,The worst movie ever!! Stanley Kubrick is awful,"Stanley Kubrick is too often praised for his 'wonderful' work. His work is terrible, and 2001 is no exception. This movie goes on for three hours and there are almost 10 lines of dialogue! Then, it just ends; the big mystery throughout the movie is totally unanswered and there is no closure.I think that people praise Kubrick because they believe that there is some 'deep' hidden message, but they are too afraid that they didn't 'get it.' So as to not look stupid, we just say, ""Oh, that was so wonderful!"" If I could I would sue him for so malicioulsy stealing three precious hours of my life. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!! UGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!By the way I gave it one star because you cannot choose 0 stars."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:2001 has 40 minutes of a good movie surrounded by lots of Fantasia 2001 (extremely slow scenes of incredible beauty set to classical music) and scenes not intended to make much sense by admission of the authors--it's worth watching in the sense that you'll never see anything like it again, but not for any other reason."
1,Sent me the wrong dvd,"On Monday, 11/1/10 I sent an email to these people telling them that Ihad received the wrong version of this movie and asking them how to proceed...They did not respond...My DVD player won't play HD versions...I have a ""standard""DVD player...I have the DVD, but I can't play it..."
3,2001 DVD no extras,Very disappointed => only a 1968 interview with A.C. Clarke & movie trailers. The trailers had negative scratches. I was hoping for a directors comments track. END
5,Living/Reading Happily Ever After,"This is a delightful book, full of heart-warming stories and breathtaking photographs. A wonderful addition to our humble collection of books, Living Happily Ever After is one of those books one simply HAS to pick up and read, over and over again... happily..."
1,BUYER BEWARE: Traditional Values Undermined,"The cover of Living Happily Ever After exudes traditional family values; however, the inclusion of homosexual couples clearly demonstrates dual intentions of the author. By not giving an indication of the books homosexual content, the author is certain to offend many unsuspecting readers. Statistically the homosexual couples are disproportionately represented. While many heterosexual couples stay together 30 years or longer, the homosexual world has been proven grotesquely promiscuous, especially among homosexual men. The book portrays long-lasting homosexual relationships as if they are the norm when nothing could be further from the truth. BUYER BEWARE, you definitely cannot judge this book by its cover."
5,People Are Hell,"A masterwork of the themes which you glimpse in the songs of LC, here shining with the glow of the Acropolis of the Native Americans painted red when seen from the floor. Beautiful Losers is at times an homage to a canadian catholic saint, a history of canada, and a bizzare love triange in hell."
5,Captivating Plot,Excellent style! Author kept my interest from page to page! The reader is compelled to continue reading! Highly recommend the book to any suspense-lover!
3,A So-So Book,"Okay, This book matched my expectations, which weren't that high, but the action and molotov cocktails earned a three star rating. Anyway, I had to read this novel for a book report (I wanted to read ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" but I couldn't), and I found in some parts hard to put down, but others, just plain boring, like the Chinese storytelling part. The main character, Alex, is a total dingdong. I mean, who paints plastic men all day long? What a freak. Three stars."
2,Disappointed,"I just got the book a week ago and this book is old and outdated, it is not hard to tell. There are very few pictures, and a distorted sense of organization. Half of the pictures were drawings of irrelevant knives. I thought I would get detailed information about throwing, but most of the book is dedicated to famous knife throwers, and not to helping you learn. It is short and overpriced. A real let-down. I would get a more up-to-date book on the subject."
4,dark and enjoyable,"This book takes place in a series of dark scenes as two young people try to save a magician from a deal he has made earlier, although he is not highly deserving of their loyalty or help. The characters are not deeply developed but this didn't really bother me, since the book was more intent on creating a mood of gloom and strangeness. The ending didn't answer all questions, so I'm hoping for a sequel. I would recommend this to people who liked Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast novels and Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Likewise, if you liked this, you might want to try those authors."
1,Cryptography somewhat superficial,"The description of RSA leaves a lot to be desired. I got the impression that the author doesn't really understand it. I bought the book but would not recommend it. Very glossy presentation, however."
4,The Conversation - 1974 Movie Worth Watching,"Another great movie written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, A suspenseful movie from 1974 which had some great actors/actresses; Gene Hackman, Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford, Teri Garr to name a few."
3,Curious mov between &#65533;Godfathers&#65533;,"MY RATING- 6.7This one has been sometimes forgot in the middle of the colossal ""Godfather"" parts.It has a brave acting of Gene Hackman, that goes very well as Harry Caul, ""the best bugger in the West Coast"". He's lonely, frightened and he pleases himself hearing his tapes many times.Sometimes the mov gets some thriller touches with Hackman being hunted, however it gets monotuous after a while and we see why the ""Godfather"" movs are better.Good acting by the rest of the cast Frederic Forrest, John Cazale (a favorite from Coppola), young Harrison Ford and a cameo by Robert Duvall.Not for all tastes."
2,"Great acting, confusing and annoying plot.","I agree with the reviewer from Maryland. The movie was confusing, lacked suspense, and got very irritating. Gene Hackman was excellent, and so was John Cazale, but the other characters were very flawed and I can hardly remeber anything that happens with them. The plot was confusing. Why did the boss die instead of the two lovers? And what did ""When The Red Red Robin Comes A Bop Bop Boppin' Along"" have to do with this? Skip this one; it is too confusing and should be forgotten."
2,Mediocre Meco,"I've purchased this model grill three time before from regular retail stores and loved them. After first use of this one, I discovered the lid was dented so badly that the smoking function was lost. The front legs were so much shorter that grease from cooking all flowed out the front bottom. If I had discovered the damage before using, I might have bothered to try and re-pack and sent it back. Will get another, but not from Amazon."
4,Decent overview of Skid Row's career,"I'll start my review by stating that I usually hate greatest hits compilations. They rarly get it right, and almost never cover everything that fans have come to expect from the band.As far as compilations goes, ""40 Seasons - The Best Of Skid Row"" is actually a pretty solid disc overall. I can't really complain about the songs that were included, even though some exclusions were head scratching, and other inclusions were moreso. My biggest gripe with this album is, why are all the songs from ""Subhuman Race"" either demos or remixed? As long as I have owned this album, I have never figured that out. The song listing otherwise is extremely thorough though. All the hits are present, sans ""Wasted Time"", which is missed, but not essential.If you like Skid Row, I suggest buying all three of their records, which pretty much makes this compilation meaningless. Unless you really want the two demo songs."
5,Mr. Flute Himself,"I am a true Nelson Rangell fan from the heart. He plays technically and with precission. His sax play is very good and No he his not a David Sanborn sound a like as some critics would say. He has his own sound and style if you listen carefully. One thing I would like for him to do is to make a all FLUTE CD. This guys flute play is impecable. His trills and texture and tone are of the best quality I have ever heard from a jazz flutest besides Hubert Laws (""IN THE LAND OF PASSOIN"" CD which I can't find anywhere). I would very much like for Nelson to do an ALL FLUTE CD someday. Once a gain Mr. Flute Himself just blows me away when every flute song that he plays."
4,Great Product,"Though it took a few days longer to ship then I anticipated, the product is outstanding. My fish absolutely love the food and there seems to be less waste with this brand.Highly recommended."
4,Another winner,"If this book is ever made into a movie Guy Ritchie should be first choice to direct it. Hutson delivers another compulsive story in this tale of a band of small time crooks out to pull one last job, the biggest of their lives. The only problem is the money they have stolen belongs to a powerful crime kingpin who gives them an ultimatum. Either he kills them on the spot or they can take a chance at having their lives spared and kill a psychotic Jamaican kingpin who is gruesomely butchering other criminals in order to become No. 1.Being a Hutson novel there is ample graphic violence and the usual cliches he uses because Hutson himself admits he's too lazy to think of anything else. That's not a bad thing, though his previous book WARHOL'S PROPHECY was a lot better. I hope he returns to the horror genre again, if only once more. But this is good."
3,Well written.,"Well written book. It would be nice to have some ""MatLab"" problems. Excellent motivational or explanatory examples.I gave it three stars because most reviewers are far to liberal with their stars. To me 3 stars means worth buying, 4 means a must buy, and 5 means it'll be a classic for a long time.I equate this book to Mallet's ""A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing"". The subject matter is slightly different, but both are very readable."
5,Great Songs And Even Better Music!,"Tony, Toni, Tone was one of my favorite R & B groups. This album along with the very last one they did (House Of Music) was among the best they did together.The standout track was Anniversary without a doubt. Its one of those tracks that's as powerful today as it was in 1993 when it was made! Translation....it is timeless!The rest of the tracks range from okay (Tony, Toni, Tone) to good (My Ex-Girlfriend, Slow Wine) to excellent (If I Had No Loot) to timeless (Anniversary, Lay Your Head On My Pillow). In my view, no song on here is below a 3 star rating!Its also one of those albums I sincerely wished had an instrumental version because the music behind these songs is great too! I could bob my head to these pieces without the lyrics!Anyway, its a great piece of R & B to own."
5,GROOVING,"This Is One OF THE FEW MUST HAVE ALBUMS FROM THE 90's,THE VOCALS,SLOW-Jams&Fast Jams.THE GROOVES ARE Still SLAMMIN'.Leavin' is In THE JACKSON 5 Vibe.So Many Styles&Great Arrangements.THey Were Getting Better&Better with each Album.This Band was Tight.I Miss R-N-B Like THis."
2,A drummers perspective,"Ugh drum machines! There may be a real drummer buried in there somewhere, then again maybe not. The time is too tight, horrible programmed drum breaks. If I Had No Loot is catchy after that the songs tend to sound the same and forgettable. Better bets Tower of Power, Neville Bros, or even Chic-ism by Chic (better drum programming)."
2,Bummed Brummell,"This version of ""Beau Brummel"" is not from Warner Home Video (WHV) -- and it shows! It's from some outfit called Televista, whom I have not heard of. The keepcase design on the back is poor, with type very hard to read (colored type on a black background -- bad type color!, and a poor choice of typeface.)The print itself is lousy+. What is infuriating above all is that this silent film was projected through a sound aperature, which cuts off part of the top and lefthand sides of the frame (all of the inter-titles are off center, and the tops of most of the heads are partly cut off).I feel I spent way too much for this version, and I hope that WHV will come out with their own version. I suspect, considering the quality of this film, that it is a 16mm copy of a much-used 35mm print. It is hard to watch, with such low quality, and certainly no care was taken to put it on this DVD. Do not waste your money on this one!"
2,no way to fix,i purchased this item it seems to get little pin holes in the upper part i dont no how but it does the patches dont work its like its tape i tried everything to keep it flated it just wont work bottom part is fine though but with out the top it seems like your sleeping on a box spring
3,Wrong info,"I notice that one of the previous reviewers mentioned that this item does not run on batteries, while the product specs listed state that it does. I myself noticed that the shipping weight is listed as 22 (or so) lbs. -- that also is inaccurate, I weighed this thing on a freight scale, and it was around 40. It felt even heavier than that, so much so that it was trouble moving it around before I inflated it. I don't think I'm going to use this for very long, because it rises so high off my waterbed frame! I should probably just break down and get a regular mattress...."
2,Wenzel Queen Raised Insta-Flex Air Bed with Built-in AC Pump,The pillow top portion of the bed started leaking after few times of use.
4,Basically I like it,"This bed is very confortable, but holes developed within 3 months. Order a second one, hoping the first was just defected."
1,Wenzel Insta-Flex Queen Airbed with Pump,"This bed was absolutely dreadful. The bed popped a hole along the seam after a mere couple of weeks. We tried to patch up the hole, but it kept getting larger and we had to replace the bed. I can only tell you to be careful if you buy this bed and keep your receipt. Our mattress is headed for the trash recycle bin, where it belongs. Shame on you Wenzel for selling such a bad product. Amazon customers beware of this product!"
1,Durability of the Wenzel Air Bed with Built-in AC Pump,The design of the bed is awesome. Unfortunately it would not hold air. There were no visible flaws. The instructions state that the bed will need additonal air after the bed is originally used. The bed would not hold air at all. (I only attempted to use it in the house and checked for possible problems there 1st)I purchased another bed assuming that the 1st bed had a flaw and the second one did exactly the same thing. I love the design but I am disappointed in the quality.
3,Wenzel Queen Raised Air Bed,"Seems to be well-made of heavy-duty vinyl and easy to set up and adjust. Adjustable back makes reading or TV viewing a pleasure! The only fault I've found is that after some use, it develops a concave depression causing you to always roll toward the center."
4,Need a Handle on Modernity and Postmodernity?,"Thornhill has done us a great service in the production of this book. As a PhD student at Boston College, I'm fascinated with the social and philosophical phenomenon we refer to as ""postmodernity."" But it can be a difficult idea to get a handle on. What is postmodernity? What is modernity? How are they similar or different? Why does it matter? If modernity is passing away, why is this so and can it be redeemed? Thornhill suggests that it can and he sees a way to do this in authentic catholicity. This book is invaluable to me as I prepare to write my dissertation and I highly recommend it."
1,Star War Sheets,"My son was so excited to get these sheets for his birthday. However, even after I washed them, they felt like sandpaper...way too rough for anyone to sleep on so I ended up sending them back for a refund. Too bad!!"
2,A disappointing followup from a rare vocalist.,All I can say that despite the inspirational nature of these songs they are pretty musically mundane. These recordings are not worthy of such a gifted artist.A real shame.
2,a disappointing follow up,"After 'Circle of One', Ms. Adams' debut cd I had high hope for her follow up release. I was very disappointed, not in Oleta Adams' vocals or song writting and choices but with the over produced nature of the music. WAY too much electric piano (ugh), bells and whistles. A wise man once said 'with Oleta Adams less is more'!!!"
5,Great little cable (for the price.),"This is a good cable, and if it works 4 u, then, you're doing ok. It is recommended."
4,appealing story and interesting characters,"This fun animation starts with the earth being blown up and humans become the gypsies of the universe, despised because they are still chased by the Drej, a race of energy beings.The most impressive scene is where the ship is being chased through an asteroid field made up of ice. The reflections of the ships and eery crackling as the ice asteroids shift made for an exciting chase.Titan A.E. is a favorite film of mine, one I watch over and over. It is visually stunning with an upbeat soundtrack and plenty of humor."
2,The Best Anime Film!,"This movie was ok, but it definitely wasn't a good anime film. Everything in this movie suffered, from the character development to the story line. I did not find myself hooked into the the story line or any of its characters. Anyone who wants to see a good sci-fi anime knows that you have to look towards japanese animation. With classics such as Akira, Macross, Ghost in the Shell, Neon Genesis, and many other sci-fi japanamations, this movie doesn't even come close. It was a good try, but just like most american animation films it just didn't cut it."
3,A Good Watch!,"I impulsively bought Titan AE yesterday without ever seeing the film before. When I saw the cover, I shuddered a bit as it said: ""This is the movie Star Wars fans have been waiting for"" How many times have films shot themselves in the foot by setting themselves up to be the next Star Wars, only to fail miserably?Well much to my surprise, this did not happen here. No, this is definitely NOT the next Star Wars (although I can see where there are some similarities). But it is an enjoyable experience. I don't regret buying this DVD at all as it has become a welcomed addition to my collection.Rent it if you need something to do on a quiet evening. You'll definitely enjoy it. Buy it if you're a sci-fi fan."
3,GOOD EFFECTS,"This animated movie had good effects and a gnerally good history line, but Damon's voice as the main character was a poor choice. He showed his lack of talent here. Anyway, it's a great entertainment."
1,Titan A.E.,The DVD was scratched and could not be read. Very disappointed as it was a gift for my grandson. It would have been a great price if it had worked.
3,A Thrilling 2-D/Computer Animated Flash Gordon like Space Adventure,"Take a ride into deep space in one of the most thrilling animated films ever made, ""TITAN A.E."" A SC-FI story of survival & war in the 31st century as an evil alien race called the Drej destroy Earth & humanity's last chance of a new planet is with the Titan, the most advanced ship in the universe, it's up to a young man named Cale & a crew of 2 humans & 3 aliens to find it with an enclosed map in the palm of his hand. fantastic spectacular SC-FI film, no other animated film like it, a 21st century Flash Gordon, featuring the voice talents of Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman, Nathan Lane, John Legiazamo & Jeanne Garafolo. If you love animated films or SC-FI then take the journey through deep space & get ready for life after Earth, in ""TITAN A.E. ""You can't beat the Drej, no one can, the're pure energy"""
4,Really good feature...,"I bought this movie on a whim because it was very affordable and I was always curious to see it. I saw it and I liked it a lot. I didn't go into the movie with a lot of expectations, I usually don't watch animated movies but this caught my attention, special effects and story alike."
3,Titan AE (special edition),It's an alright movie. I only got it because Joss Whedon co-wrote the script. It kinda leaves you unsatisfied after.
4,Almost perfect,"This is a fun movie. The animation is pretty amazing. I only have two issues.First the hard rock video-like segments are embarassing to listen to. Not to mention pointless to the plot.Second, a sense of time is very much missing here; the entire plotline seems to take only day or two at most, but then there it seems like those would be an exceedingly busy couple of days. Personally, a comment or two along the lines of ""Why did it take you a whole week to track me down and free me from these slave traders?"" would have given me a better sense of pacing.However, these are minor complaints. I enthusiastically recommend getting your hands on a copy, especially cause you can find them really cheap; I saw a copy at Target for $6.99 last weekend."
2,"AS ""COLD"" AS THE NEBULA'S ICE RINGS!","I cannot believe that the same director of the passionately produced ""An American Tail"" and the marvelously executed ""Secret of N.I.M.H."" could have made this ""soulless"" adventure. None of the characters is interesting enough to care about, and if the future of humanity rests on the shoulders of ""Cale,"" then, let mankind end. This flick, for all its technological wizardry, is about as thrilling as a trip to the orthodontist."
1,Full Screen Black Hole...,"This film is currently not available in widescreen format in Video On Demand. Why do studios and distributors insist on wrecking otherwise excellent work by subjecting it to ""pan and scan""? Don't bother with this version - the animation is completely ruined. Rent or buy the widescreen DVD and always make sure to check the format before purchasing."
1,Titan AE is horrible. horrible for Sci FI Lovers. Horrible .,"The teen cartoon with the voice talents of Matt Damon & Drew Barrymore... made by the guys that did Anastasia... and suppose to knock your socks off animation. blah blah blahIt sucks. story was thin, dialogue sucked, the animation was good but after 15 minutes I was bored. The dialogue was horrendous! It was lame dialogue after each part of the movie.The characters in the movie was even worse! They tried to hit the kids genre by placing in some cuddly creatures that ended up looking disgusting and unmarketable.boring.... even the kids didn't care too much..... I went to a theater, and the kids were really bored out of there mind! the people behind were nearly falling asleep and my friend went to the washroom like 5 times cuz he was so bored. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! STAY ATLEAST 10 FEET AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!"
1,Disappointed,I got this grill in March. It worked well until July. Now it won't get hot enough to cook anything. What a disappointment!
4,Electric grill review,"The grill does all that is claimed in terms of cooking. It heats quickly, even with a cold outside temperature and works well indoors as well. The unit gets hot enough to sear the meat nicely. The only unfirtunate flaw is that the reflector tray under the heating coil cannot be disconnected and removed for cleaning. It is also not possible to slip aluminum foil in between to help with cleanup so juices get burnt on. I hope that oven cleaner may clean the tray"
2,"Lame Characters, So-so Time Travel","I bought this book because the plot sounded cool but it never really developed beyond ""Wow what am I doing here"" and ""My husband is hot"".At the end of this novel, I still have NO CLUE as to the inner workings of either the hero or the heroine, besides the fact that the heroine at one point had some body image issues, which so quickly resolved after she lost weight - despite the fact that everybody from the maid to her husband told her she looked fine.The hero remains poorly sketched. Apparently he's handsome, but really, at the end of this novel, I didn't care. *yawn*The one positive was the unusual time travel method (heroine switches place with another woman), but if you're into time travel there are WAY BETTER BOOKS OUT THERE! (i.e. anything by Karen Marie Moning)"
3,When We Meet Again (Effington Family) by Victoria Alexander,"I have finished all of the books in this series, as well as read a lot of other books by Alexander. This would be my least favorite, but i still enjoyed it."
5,So Good I Had to Read the Series,"This book captured me so much so that I am reading the remaining books in the series. The writing allows you to visual the story. I laughed, cried and smiled through the whole book. I will re-read the book when after "" A Visit from Sir Nicholas."""
5,Great for Curly Hair!,I really enjoyed this book. It gave me some great advice I had never heard before on how to deal with my curly hair. It talks about hairstyles and haircare for several different types of curly hair. It's wonderful the author has curly hair herself and isn't just guessing what it feels like to live with it.
1,Get CURLY GIRL book instead,"Sorry but this book was like watching an informercial for Ouidad products. Don't waste your money on the book or the ""miracle product."" Buying a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner which contains the right proteins, emollients, humectants etc.and alcohol-free clear hair gel from your local discount store will do the trick. HINT: Look for products in the ethnic hair care section of your store, product with a big price tag that promises your hair a miracle!"
4,I like Romancing the Stone better,"Although I like this movie, I like Romancing the Stone much better. I don't find myself watching this very often but still wanted it in blu-ray. I was disappointed with the video and audio quality of this movie as well as Romancing the Stone. They both are about the same quality in that regard. I was expecting more. Although better than standard dvd it is slightly below average in blu-ray quality."
1,Incomplete without the soundtrack's music video,"I'm not gonna buy it because they didn't includeBilly Ocean's When The Going Get Tough music videofrom the soundtrack.It makes no sense not to include itbecause Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turnerand Danny DeVito were in the video.Scott"
3,Still Thinking...,"James Brown is a legend. For that he gets mad respect. I really liked some cuts on this album and some i didnt. I never really was a huge JBrown fan, and to be honest i thought he was a little off and i never really liked his slave/work mentality approach that he brought to his music and to the people that worked for him...But the album is cool to add to your collection. I wont be bumping this in the whip though!"
4,"A Good Read, but...","McDermott's ""Seeing God"" is a good read, but you would do better to pick up the original John Edwards, or one of Dallas Willard's texts.McDermott does illuminate spirituality through his ""twelve reliable signs;"" however, he does not plumb the depth of spirituality in the way Edwards does with his ""Affections.""This book would serve best in a high-school Bible class, or as a small group text for new believers. For those needing more meat, see J. Edwards."
1,Garbage,"I am a Motorola employee who purchased this phone via the employee purchase plan. Conveniently after the warranty expired, the phone was defective. The numbers on the phone keypad stopped functioning. Do not purchase this phone or any other Motorola cordless products due to their very poor quality."
2,Disappointed...,"1. Horrible voice quality. Lots of static and poor sound differentiation.2. Answering machine will randomly stay on, preventing further incoming calls. Motorola's solution -- unplug power for 10 minutes each time this happens (4 times a week on average). Thanks guys.3. Battery life is between 1 and 2 hours! Terrible.4. At least it looks cool."
1,Motorola MD 481,"I live in Austin, Texas, want to support Motorola as much as possible. Have been pleased with Motorola Star Tac - dropped many times, still works fine. The MD481 is the worst phone I have ever had - worse than the '93 Sony that I was trying to replace. If you love to say it a lot, and your favorite word is ""WHAT"", you will love this phone. Maybe it's my computer - who cares because I have one desk. Both computer and phone must call it home. Thank goodness for the 30 day warranty. This puppy is going back to the pound! I love Motorola and will try the 5.8 GHZ MD681."

1,"Looks nice, BUT","This phone has great options, however the buttons cease to work after a little while and the battery duration is terrible. Looks can be deceiving and Motorola is ZERO help. I will not be purchasing a Motorola product again."
2,Out of Date,"I got this book not realizing it wasn't the latest version and ended up ordering the latest one after I received it. It has good information, but it is pretty out of date. The latest edition however is great and I would recommend it."
3,My thoughts regarding the Meco series 4106:,"I love the product but wish that a cover was available. The assembly instructions, however, were very vague and unclear. I only gave it three stars rating because I've had several of these prior and loved them."
5,Happy Customer,"I am very pleased with any & all DVD's I have bought from Amazon.Com.It is such a good feeling to know with 99 per cent certainty that the DVD or possibly VHS will be of the highest quality and if not that you make good on the purchase.I am a very happy customer.Thank you,thank you."
2,No longer supported.,"Device works well enough. Sound drivers wouldn't get picked up in vista. The maker of the device was bought out though, and there is no longer active support, just an outdated website of drivers."
5,Handy Handbook,"The ""Codename: Kids Next Door '2x4 Technology Handbook'"" is one of the ultimate books in KND knowledge. (The other is ""Sooper Secrets and Boomerang Bloopers"".)This book, presented by Numbuh Two, has SOME of the KND inventions used in episodes like ""Operation: L.I.C.E."" and ""Operation: S.H.A.V.E."", and others you've never seen before ! Each gadget, weapon, and vehicle has the inside info on what it's used for and what it's made out of for their full potential. Also, each invention tells quite a story or two; especially with the fact that more new episodes are being aired.So if you want to know about some of the KND doohickies and thingamabobs used in the TV show are, get this book and be amazed. Though I wish they'd put in more inventions and other stuff in there because I am surely more than certain there's many, many more than that ![END TRANSMISSION]"
5,How To Kill A Rockstar: Excellent Read,"Wow...this book is so good! My heart hurt, I cried; I was happy, felt overjoyed. This book had it all. I stayed up all night to finish it and my eyes are puffy & I'm exhausted but it was worth it all!"
5,Could Not Put it DOWN!,"Love Love Loved this book. It was such a fun and unique story and had me laughing out loud, crying, and cheering from the very begining. I didn't want the book to end!!!!"
4,This Book Is AWESOME,"I bought this book because it was referred by other indie authors. I absolutely loved it. It was witty, funny, made me smile, tear, all of the above. I even held my breathe a few times when reading. The one thing that I thought was odd was her reference to Jesus. How Paul looked like a rock star Jesus. Although funny, it was strange? But a great read altogether!"
1,Don't waste your money,"It was flat after one night of sleeping. We had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning.Also, be aware that you need an AC outlet to pump it up ... it's NOT for camping."
1,blu-ray please! region 4 dvd is best available still...,"The Australian DVD is the best we have so far; so long as you have a region free DVD player so you can watch the UNCUT version with a 5.1 soundtrack; unlike the CRAP stereo only US DVD.I really hope to see a Blu-Ray disc of this with surround sound track for the US market... the UNCUT version please. Also the documentary ""Ladies Please"" would be great."
5,A GAY CULT CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,A story about three drag queens in an old bus named Priscilla who set out across the Australian Outback for a performance at an Australian resort. Pathos and Comedy are mixed in equal proportions to provide the viewer with a unique perspective of a little understood lifestyle. You will fall in love with the entire cast and the movie will immediately become a beloved favorite!!!!
4,Enough one-liners to make anyone a drag queen!,"This film is essentially a road trip flick featuring Priscilla, a huge bus hurdling through the Australian outback with three bedecked and bedazzled drag queens inside. Of course, the bus and the trip are symbols for the personal growth experienced by the three men along the way, but the best part of this film is really its searing one-liners. Any film in which a man in drag says to a tough bar-broad ""why don't you light your tampon and blow your box apart because that's the only bang you're ever gonna get"" is a good one in my book. The costumes and ""production numbers"" another the trip are a joy to behold. Although the film waivers a bit trying too hard to be a poignant meditation on the trials and tribulations of queer folk (i.e. one of the queens is on his way to see his wife and child, the bus is painted with a blatantly anti-gay message along the trip), it never fails to entertain and keeps the pace going with ABBA and other disco favorites."
3,OKAY DEBUT.....BUT JUST A NOVELTY,"After YEARS of Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton's The Living Daylights came as a breath of fresh air. But that breath of fresh air quickly turn stale. The Living Daylights had a plot that needs a Rhodes scholar to untangle. Despite Kell Tyler's Linda Collier in the pretitle sequence, Maryam D'Abo's dull and colorless Kara Milovy is the only Bond girl in this romp.As for Tim himself. He gave a good performance, but it is a performance that cannot sustain the Bond series for long. He is way too serious and tries to put Bond back to the way Ian Fleming wrote him...,a mistake considering the series became successful when the movie made a departure from the novels (unless it is a good novel, like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, or Dr. No).Oh, did I mentioned that it is quite boring? Yes, it is also bone dull in parts, especially when the action switch to Afghanistan.Dalton's second Bond, Licence To Kill, is more entertaining."
5,I thought it was great! I really enjoyed it!,I was glad when I saw General Kuskof fall off the plane. And I liked the graphics of the flames.
1,Another 007 Dissappointment,James Bond may be the worst series of movies ever produced. My brother bought this movie while I was logged in. The producers of these so called films have cranked out around 20 of these 2 hour pieces of crap. I suggest to annyone who has not been pleased with other 007 movies will not enjoy this one either. The plots are the same the only diferance between them is the scenery and actors.
2,Has trouble,"I liked this film mainly for two reasons. They are the stunts and Dalton's performance. Everything else is poor. Myram D'Abo is dull and very boring, Kuscov and Whitaker are spirited but not at all menacing, there is about no action, the script is very thin, the plot is very confusing, the settings are not exotic, and John Barry's score is his worst. The gadgets are okay, yet many other OO7 filmshave much better gadgets. If you want my to see some good OO7 films, check out From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, The Spy who Loved Me, GoldenEye, and A View To a Kill. Avoid You Only Live Twice, The Man With The Golden Gun, Moonraker, The Living Daylights, and The World is Not Enough."
2,A few good things,"The Living Daylights isn't a bad OO7 film, it just isn't very good. The two good things are the song and Dalton. Everything else, P-U! D'Abo is one of the worst Bond girlz, and the villains aren't good. This film doesn't even have a Bond feel,it feels like you're watching some big TV-made drama. The henchman is SOO bland, and the villains are FAR from menacing. The plot is so confusing that I finally figured it out after seeing it six times! If you want to see GOOD OO7, check out Diamonds are Forever, Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, Thunderball, The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your eyes Only, Octopussy, License to kill, or Tomorrow Never Dies. Avoid The Living daylights, The Man with the Golden GUn, A view to a kill, Live and Let Die, and Thw world Is Not Enough."
2,strong contender for worst bond film,"No wonder the franchise died out a bit in the 80s. This movie was absolutely horrible. It was literally painful to listen to the dialog in this movie; The actors could barely carry the terrible plot; all the class of a bond movie was replace with gaudy 80s pop culture. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this film and had to immediately rewatch ""From Russia with Love"" as to not loose respect for the series."
5,A rediscovered gem,"Rediscovered this gem while cleaning out 20+ years of CDs. I was going to give it a 4 vice 5 until I double checked a saw I had burned 8 of the 13 tracks to my i-pod. While ""Laid"" was the only tune that got any radio airtime in the U.S.; Dream Thrum, One of the Three, Say Something, P.S., Everybody Knows, Low Low Low, and Lullaby are really worth a listen. Discoveries like this make me scratch my head and wonder why some groups/performers really break through and others don't."
4,Great targets.,These targets are great. The paper is nice and heavy so it holds up well in windy conditions. The visability of these targets are great as well.
3,Basic Instinct 2,"After re-locating from San Francisco to London, best-selling crime novelist Catherine Trammell once again finds herself on the wrong side of the law. Dr. Michael Glass, a respected London criminal psychiatrist, is brought in by Scotland Yard detective Roy Washburn to perform a psychiatrist profile and evaluation of Tramell following the mysterious death of a top sports star. The first one was so much better are they ever going to make a good sequel."
3,not bad but not outstanding,"I didn't find it that bad at all. I wasn't expecting too much having seen the original umpteen times and read the scathing remarks when it came out. What was lacking was a believable character like shooter aka Michael Douglas, or Gus his side kick. They just seemed to gel in the original.I thought the Shrink (Dr Glass) looked a bit like John Cleese, and was expecting his funny walk at any moment. The cop was also a bit of a disaster for me. He reminded me of a foul-mouthed dixon of dock green for those of you old enought to remember that series. I also think the Brittehsness was a bit out of place. The original film had more of an edge when it was filmed in san fran. Everthing seemed to gel in that film: the characters, the setting, the plot, This film seemed clumsy. I also thought Tramell overdid her femme-fatele image too much.But it's worth watching."
4,Basic Instinct 2,"Movie critics were not so kind to this movie, but I think it was pretty good not as good as Basic Instinct but enjoyable just the same .Sharon Stone was sexy as always. I must admit at her age she looks so hot.Dr Glass (David Morrissey) was good too,but in some parts over acting in his role,but acceptable just the same.Quality of blu ray print is very nice."
4,Nice Follow Up,"Just as eery as the first one. It took her in a new direction in character. Once again, Sharon Stone continues to involve her audience in her web of lies. I would strongly recommend this movie."
1,worst acting ever,"Sharon stone may get hotter with age, but her acting sure doesn't. What was with that fake ""trying to be sexy"" accent? It made me want to puke."
3,"come on , be intellectually honest , you know you like it","i figure a star per dollar ratio at the LOTS is a good reinvestment on this baby . perhaps as the man of the hour writes , it doesn't have all the goods . rent a porn . this film was a labor of lust as the editorial-a-new-one review suggests . i like it . i divested myself of it and now i've reaquired the modest nugget . i'm in it like the tar baby ."
5,Wooly Bully,"Flat out: This is a very nice topcoat and a steal at the sale price. I have meant to buy a full length navy blue topcoat for several years and always put it off. White shoe types will insist on cashmere but this feels as nice to my hand as that cloth. You won't impress any clothing snobs with a JAB suit or coat but they will not be able to tell the difference with their eyes unless you show them the label.The coat is cut large enough to generously fit over a suit or sport coat so don't order 'up'. It has a great, full length, nice heft and fine feel. Be warm and look great. At this price, I may get another in a different color!"
1,Start your own Import/Export Business,"The authors of this book could not make up their minds ""should this be a joke or serious book"" their choice was to make serious subjects into a joke and thus made a truly worthless book. It got to the point where I was so upset at having to read 6th grade jokes (sorry 6th graders, you are probably much more clever) that any information was lost. You can learn as more about the import/export business by going to the store and reading shipping labels."
4,Take off the Training Wheels,"Kenner does a fabulous job dissecting Ulysses into various themes. He brings out ideas and elements that are not evident to a casual reader. As good as this book is, however, IT IS NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME READER. This book is for readers of Joyce who are ready to take off their training wheels and go for a real ride. First time readers of Ulysses would be much better served by the New Bloomsday Book (excellent beginner's guide) or even the Cliff's Notes (pretty good, but misses the mark occasionally).If you have read Ulysses once and are ready to enjoy it again. This book will open a lot of Joyce's mysteries for you."
3,Not sure about this Product....,"Perhaps I did not give this product enough time to work properly, but it did not seem to help my immune systemat all considering I got a couple head colds while taking it."
5,an irie album,"smash hits is the first album by the group that i purchased. i am proud of the fact that i made a good choice(since i was just getting into reggae at the time). and now i am hooked! but, it is a good hook. all the songs on the disc are of good quality. for one, the vocals are more clear here than they are on some of the group's earlier works(i.e handsworth revolution). i was a radio host in college(i had a reggae show). most of the requests that i got from my listeners were for songs by steele pluse(second only to bob..and maybe toots). matter of factly, the songs requested were all located on this particular disc. my favorite songs on the disc are: rave, chant a psalm, roller skates and of course lego beast. hey lego beast, wanna play?(just joking). peace to all my guyanese brethen and sistren. God bless all!!!"
4,Very limited representation for the casual Getz fan,"A video on the internet--the one and only encounter of Stan Getz and John Coltrane--has attracted at least a million viewers and perhaps as many opinions, most of them loudly proclaiming Coltrane the ""victor"" and some even characterizing Getz as ""technically limited."" The present collection may satisfy listeners who were initially attracted to the ""cool"" Stan Getz sound of the early '60s bossa period and the earlier '50s cool bop / West Coast period. But it fails to incorporate the Getz whom Norman Granz frequently put up alongside Dizzy, Stitt and Rollins on Verve recording sessions for which there were no rules about speed limits and lengths of choruses. If you're looking for a collection representing one of the all-time masters of his instrument, a musician whom even Michael Brecker once called the best saxophonist, this isn't the disc--perhaps no single disc is capable of capturing the once-in-a-lifetime talent of this Olympian player."
2,"Good Tips, but better books are out there","I thought the tips in this book were good, and they were easier to absorb, and more concisely presented than in the Kaplan book. However, they were the same tips the Kaplan book had. On top of that the Kaplan book had a wealth of tests on the computer (like the actual tests), and is a better buy than this book.I can't comment on the accuracy of the scores because I didn't take any full length tests from this book, but a really accurate score predicter is the free software (PowerPrep) you get when you register for the GMAT. They give you 2 practice tests that are basically identical to the real tests (as well as tons of exercises) that give you a score within 20 points of what you'll actually score."
1,Diagnostic test provides unrealistic results,"Before reading this book, I took the diagnostic test at the beginning of the book to get a baseline of my GMAT score. I made a 730, so naturally, I thought that I would do much better on the real test. I read the book and went through all of the math practice tests (my weakest area). On the night before my exam, I decided to take the PowerPrep test to see how much I had improved after studying for a few weeks. I made a 550. Imagine my disappointment!I decided to not take the GMAT test the next day and wasted hundreds of dollars.I haven't taken any of the other diagnostic tests in the other books, but they've got to be better than this one! Also, the questions on the PowerPrep exam were MUCH more difficult than the sample questions and practice questions in this guide.In short, if you do well according to this book, don't expect to do well on the GMAT!I had the 2nd Edition, btw."
1,The worst book on the market,"This has got to be the worst book ever... I totally disagree with all the reviews. First of, the examples are horrible - nothing like the real GMAT. This book states that you should leave any questions unanswered blank; whereas Kaplan and Princeton Review state that you should guess. There are also many other mistakes that I do not remember. Reading the Princeton Review & Kaplan and practicing the examples from ETS will lead to a better score. Also, there is no need to waste any money in classes."
5,Just the best,"Bought this as a gift for my wife who is a dyed-in-the-wool deadhead, and it was a total hit. I think by now she's probably read it cover-to-cover, although it's more of a reference book than ""a read.""Although not really ""into the dead"" in the same way, I find myself dipping into it when some lyric isn't clear or catches my ear. Invariably there's some fascinating little tid bit there that leaves me enjoying the music just a little more. Great buy!"
4,hours of sing-along fun,"Even though my dad already knows all the words to all the songs, he still enjoyed flipping through this volume while singing along to his favorites. The art throughout was undoubtedly an extra source of inspiration."
4,"About average, but good for the price","I've seen better, but not at this price. They should do the job just fine. Sure, if you are a pro you'll spend the bucks, but I'm not (yet) and they do the job as well as expected."
4,Nancy Drew in Scotland,"Attention Carolyn Keene fans! Nancy Drew is in Scotland! She is looking for a missing heirloom (brooch) and a flock of missing sheep. Any mystery/Nancy Drew fan will like it. Nancy Drew is a great protagonist. She cared about others while at the same time trying to solve the mystery.Overall, the book was one of Carolyn Keene's best work. She has great characters and many page-turning suspenseful events."
3,Well made but fatal flaw,"Plain and simple. You will love this until it crashes into the tub and wakes you up at 2 in the morning. Unless you plan on removing and cleaning every month religiously, it will fall. The suction cups just can't keep holding longer than about a month. Worse if you have any kind of porous tile at all. I have smooth tile and the longest it has lastest is a month and a half, usually about a month. I'm looking at the 3M tape on ones now."
3,Good for awhile,The suction does NOT hold indefinitely.There are times everything comes crashing down without warning.You then just have to reapply it and secure it in place.It is a very useful item but unpredictable.
4,And now for something different,"Perhaps it was a mistake to make a film in which Bond goes off on a personal adventure, it was always going to alienate the more hard-core traditionalists who want Bond to play it by numbers.I personally enjoyed this film and at the time it was my favourite (I must watch them all again and see where it falls). I also enjoyed it for the fact that Q got the chance to operate in the field too, joining 007 in his adventure.The DVD is heavily featured with commentaries, a couple of features about the film, stills, trailers and music videos.The picture quality of the film is excellent, The music videos however are relatively poor (if the film gets 5/5 for picture the music videos get 3/5) but to be honest I am not concerned about those. The sound quality is excellent. In short a very good DVD."
4,Too many,"The movie works well, but i was misled into believing i only bought one but i ended up with two and was unable to return just one of them."
2,"Good action, but Dalton is wrong choice as Bond","Dalton's second time as Bond is different than many other Bond films; unfortunately, that doesn't mean that it's better. This is a leaner, meaner Bond film, devoid of humor, and with a truly nasty drug lord as a villain, well played by Robert Davi. There's also a tough Bond girl (Carey Lowell) who has to compete for attention with the villain's girl (Talisa Soto). One thing I couldn't understand: Lowell's character is portrayed as tough and independent, yet at times, she's whining that she doesn't get enough attention from ol' James.The biggest problem is Dalton. Like The Living Daylights (which is the worst Bond film ever), Dalton is dry, and displays none of the class, style, or sly humor which Connery, Moore, or even Brosnan have displayed. This isn't a bad thriller, and the action sequences are terrific, but I can't say I was sorry that this was Dalton's last turn as Bond."
5,Timeless!,"Tonight I was at a store and ""The Winner Takes It All"" was playing over the loudspeaker. I got SO excited. There was not one person working there over the age of 25 and not one of the ones I asked even knew who ABBA was. What a shame. This album speaks to me today - resonates - even more than it did over twenty years ago. Make it yours!"
3,I would think about it,"It arrived fast and was in good condition, but I doubt I would order it again. It doesn't have the sound that they did when I was young. I am sure it is digitally redone."
5,Waterloo!,"I am eleven years old and I love ABBA! I think that it is a great CD, and me and my friend have a disco band called Beaver Fever and we got dressed up in bell bottoms and stuff and did an ABBA concert of Waterloo along with the tape in hsi basement for his mom and dad and it was really fun! This is a great CD and you should definatly buy it! My favorite songs are Waterloo (the best) Dancing Queen, and Fernando! BUY THIS! ""There was something in the air that night, the moon was bright Fernando, shining there for you and me, for liberty, Fernando..."""
4,Just plan fum.,"Great CD. I love the music it is fun and soothing to listen to, in my car or at home."
3,Missing some of the hits,"Some of their ""greatest hits"" are missing from this collection. The tracks included are good, but just not a comprehensive collection that you would expect from a ""greatest hits"" CD."
5,ABBA The Great!,"This is one of the best ABBA CD's for their career synopsis. It is the one to have in your car, and cruise the boulevard in true 1970's, to 1980's style. I saw them in concert in United States, and in The Netherlands. My age is showing as I was in The US Navy during much of their reign. This is still my favorite all time group. A-Teens can't beat the old Swedish Guard! One can easily see why they won The Euro contest. Wish they would reunite for a world tour."
4,ABBA's Greatest Hits,"Being 89 and a devotee of classical music , I missed ABBA's prime years . I first became aware of the group when I saw MAMMA MIA onPublic TV's presentation. I was smitten . I had to have more and soI ordered ABBA GOLD : Greatest Hits. I was satisfied with therecording. It bhad melody and rhythm, it also had a harmonious blending of voices with understandable diction. I was quite pleased with the selection. Moreover,one selection, ""Fernando"" I was already familiar with from anotherselection to my surprise."
1,"Mama Mia, what a shame!","I'm not a big fan of Abba, but have heard their music enough over the years to be very familiar with it. The launch of Mama Mia productions and the movie enticed me to buy Abba Gold to hear all of their work. This CD sounds nothing like what I have heard from a multitude of media sources. As an audio engineer I knew there was something technically wrong with this CD remix. Digital audio analysis revealed a boost in the midrange centered around 3 KHz on all 19 tracks, amongst other mixing modifications. These mixing changes can be partially corrected using an equalizer, but what tin-eared recording engineer at Polydor thought this was an ""improvement."" You can probably get a better sounding copy off old Abba LP records, if you have them and know how to create a digital copy on your PC or Mac computer. What a shame, because this poorly ""Remastered"" CD will probably end up turning-off many first-time listeners to Abba's music."
4,Can't go wrong.,ABBA just seems timeless. This one I bought as a gift. The last one I bought was 'Number Ones'.....for myself.
1,NEVER EVER BUY THIS!!!,"One of chineese products!!! AMAZON delivered that from US to UK (to my doors!!!) in less than 40 hours- amazing service!!! But the product is just crap! Whatever connectors used (RCA, low or high, ground loop isolator...) you mostly getting horrible noises through speakers and that is it. I put it back to the box and then stored it in my loft, was not worth of sending it back."
3,Ruined by a Terrible Ending,"It was a beautiful story (thus my 3 stars), but the ending was terrible. There were so many loose ends and mysterys, untied and unsolved. The characters are wonderful, the story plot is merorable, the ending STINKS! I wouldn't waste the money, unless you don't mind bad endings. One more thing, THIS IS NOT A 'GIRL' BOOK AT ALL!"
5,Sweet story,"This is a dear story about twins who have been abused and neglected by countless families, only to distrust a kind older couple that adopts them. As the story progresses, the reader glimpses how the twins warm the home and marriage of the couple that adopted them. Such a wonderful story and appropriate for children (grades 3-6)!"
5,"Intriquing, Exotic, Soothing, yet Melancholy","Super Cool. Exotica meets 40's big band arranging with a Japanese/Pacific Isle melodic twist. Historical liner notes detail the intriquing history of musicians in Hawaii's post-WWII Japanese community. I love this record, then again, everything this label puts out is excellent."
5,Top choice for a table top electric grill,We use to buy this grill many years ago but switched to another less expensive table top electric grill.Although the other grill worked well the element would stop working within one year. The less expensive grilljust would not hold up. I guess one could say we got what we paid for. We are back to top quality.Tim.
5,You'll go bannanas!...,"Vividly detailed and expressed beautifully by a woman who's compassion was to study these magnificent creatures.This book goes on to detail gorillas and their lives as well as the conflicts of deforestation and the fight to save them.You get to know individual gorillas as well as Diane Fossey and her life.I recommend this book to anyone, especially animal lovers. :)"
3,Sister Age,"I would have liked to know that even though I paid extra to expedite shipping, the time it took to receive the book was longer than if I had chosen the regular shipping option. I have no idea how good the book is because it arrived too late for my purposes. I feel like I wasted the money I paid, and will never do that again. I also am leary of the bookseller who made the promise to send the book earlier if I paid the premium. Since I did that, I feel that the bookseller did not keep his end of the deal."
2,"OK features, but not worth the price.","This phone feels solid (if not too heavy) and has some nice features. However, the price/performance ratio makes other phones much more attractive.PROs:-good, solid feel-one-year warranty-nice display-good reception-really nice sounding speaker/speakerphoneCONs:-had many people complain that I was not sounding clear-may be too heavy for some-didn't fit well to my ear-orange/red backlight is *way* too Star Trek for me!"
1,This phone failed,I had this phone for about 6 weeks and the base failed. So frustrating for a $$$ phone! We could not make calls and it caused our other phones not to work until we identified the problem. On top of this they made me pay for shipping .... And THEN the new phone had the same problem about six weeks later. DO NOT buy this phone. Shame on MOtorola for sending out this faulty product. It was obvious the rep knew there was big problems with this phone.
4,Independent Minded Horror,"The 8th Plague is a buckets-of-blood, no-holds-barred zombie fest. With first-rate acting from Leslie Valenza, a moody atmosphere, excellent editing, and stunning visuals, the movie delivers on the promise of its chilling opening moments. Horror fans will not be disappointed."
4,It's ok,"I bought this product a few weeks ago based on recommendation from a fitness instructor. I am 5ft 7in and I weigh approx 115lbs. So since I started my new exercise routine I bought this product to maintain my weight. It's a little bit too early to say if it served the purpose. But I must admit that the taste is NOT BAD and it mixes out well with a spoon unlike other protein shakes I've heard about. A co-worker used another protein shake and the moment he tried mine he said he was going to switch. Maybe he should be writing this review. One thing I appreciate about the product is that it tells us when to use it i.e. if you want to lose weight, it outlines when the best time is to take it. However, one disadvantage is that it doesn't tell me how many times per day it should be taken. As far as I know, too much protein is not good for the body so my fitness instructor told me to take it only when I am working out which is twice per week. Hope the review helps!"
5,A New Humanism - Boundless Wisdom on Every Page,"I first found this book as a result of Larry King Live interview with Tina Turner, a devout practitioner of the Buddhist school led by Daisaku Ikeda, author of A New Humanism.I was so impressed with the wisdom, courage and compassion of Mr. Ikeda's university addresses in A New Humanism that I bought several more of his books and have enjoyed each one more than the previous! It's easy to see from this book why so many prominent universities around the world have bestowed upon Daisaku Ikeda their highest awards and honorary doctorates. He is truly a world-class gentleman and scholar.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the practical applications of ancient Buddhist principles in everyday, modern life."
3,Not so good for the neck though,"I ordered this hoping to alleviate neck and back pain. Within minutes, the instructor began doing exercises requiring me to lift my neck and pull up into a sit up position which I can not do without considerable pain. Disappointed, I returned it."
2,"Exercise techniques basic, not especially helpful","Upon reading the various reviews, I eagerly awaited the DVD with the hope that the exercise regimen would alleviate my longstanding lower back pain. (I also bought an exercise mat.) Regrettably, the 25-30 minute length series of exercises were neither original nor especially useful. Also, and somewhat surprisingly given the options available on DVDs these days, there were no instructions and/or leadership on possible alternative routines. The DVD spends a fair amount of time on breathing and contains little to inspire the viewer to push himself/herself. I'll keep at it -- and, I hope, will find it necessary to revise this review weeks or months from now -- but for now, I have to say it's been a disappointment."
4,Amazing SAXON ALBUM,"THe band was produced by Jeff Glixman, who had recently produced Gary Moore's CORRIDORS OF POWER. THE POWER AND THE GLORY is a majestic album, heavy, coeherent, agressive and well crafted. It was also their last great album."
4,all his best stuff,I love it when you can get all the songs the you like from an artist in one album and for cheap
1,not very good,i was not happy because i was sent the wrong model and i can still not find the set i need? i need a set for a 2003 f-150 short bed stepside 4 door can you help me
5,the powers that be were dumb,"let's go back in our time machine to chhicago, 1976/77you have a band that sells records, and it slows up a bit. there is this new music called disco, and your number one band needs something to tide them over. your sitting there with a tape of ""down to the line"", or a fantastic loud great version of ""the letter""......which do you release? well, lucky for us, we FINALLY GET THE RIGHT ONE RELEASED HERE! fred turners vocals, and the playing are just superb. the rest of the cd is all the hits, and nothin' but the hits, along with great lp cuts........this cd is fantastic. too bad they couldn't add the canadian only bto version of ""wooly bully"" too. another great cover with fred turner vocals. buy this you wont be soorry."
4,The one to own.,"I agree with the below review. Instead of buying all the other CD's (unless you're a hardcore fan), this is the one to get. Their songwriting was always spotty for me, but the riffs were usually on-target. This s a quintessential '70s boogie band. The last few songs on disc two showed it was ime for them to quit, but the first 90% is great."
3,Pretty good!,"This video is over 15 years old, but pretty good. All information is pretty accurate, but he doesn't mention who is ""antichrist"". He says it comes from Rome and it's ""world wide religion"", but I don't know why he is afraid to say it's the papacy. It's not Hitler for sure, there is too much Hitler in this video, but only a little about the pope! People should watch out!"
2,"Bland, predictable, and utterly forgettable","Good actors and great sets cannot salvage a lame little story filled with Hollywood clichés. I'm not sure I've ever seen a film with so many of the hoary old set-pieces: generational conflict, angst and exasperation caused by the old-school immigrant parents, stressed young man hitting a career wall, cross cultural love, follow your heart, don't give up, and, the worst of all, the mysterious stranger with the solutions to all of life's problems, who blows into town, teaches the kids to dance or the adults to be tolerant, and then disappears, leaving his words of wisdom behind among the forever-changed acolytes.Not a bad film, no, not at all. But one done many times before, without anything to distinguish it from its innumerable predecessors. (And the notion that non-cooks can be brought into a kitchen and resolve a chaotic world is pretty silly.)"
3,probably complete techniques but short examples of each,"I've read two other interogation manuals(we get confessions by Albert Joseph jr. and make em talk by Patrick McDonald) so I've got a bit to go on. This book is pretty complete for techniques but the examples don't show enough. The book ""we get confessions"" is the opposite. It gives great examples but is short on techniques. The book ""make em talk"" is a military interogation manual which deals more with torcher. If you are going to read ""interrogation, techniques and tricks to secure evidense"" it would be best to read the other two books mentioned. If you were going to read any of the three books, order ""interrogation, techniques and trick to secure evidense"". By the way, this is a canadian book. The other two books are american. Not that it much matters."
5,Happy Husband,"I purhased the razor as a gift for my husband. I am now living with a happy man. The razor is doing a excellent job and he said"" never again with a blade"" . He is finding the longer he uses it the closer the shave is. Great Product, Juanita"
4,Good shaver for the money,"I was replacing a very old Norelco unit, and I haven't kept up on the latest advancements, but I've been very pleased with this shaver. The shave is close, the locking head position is a good feature, and the pop-up head gives a very good cut (better than my dedicated beard shaver). Battery life is fantastic, and the unit it is relatively quiet. Good buy."
1,The Shaver I got didn't shave close.,"The shaver I got was not good at all. After 10 minutes of shaving, I had to use a razor to finish. Maybe it was just mine that was bad, but I'm returning it."
2,Great cleaning system BUT!!,This is my second Braun. I enjoy the cleaning system BUT this is my second Braun electric razor in 26 months that has DIED?The shave is as good as the foil Panasonic but my Panasonic after 6 years is still working.There is DEFINITELY a problem with this model. 1 year use and throw it away! It resembles the realiability length of time as 20 BIC RAZORS. I love electric razors but for $140.00 they should last longer than 1 year.
2,Didn't do the job for me,"-This thing was never able to give me a close shave on the neck unless I attacked each hair individually-This morning, after just a couple of months, a plastic piece brokeI'm going back to my Norelco"
3,Well engineered shaver,Braun has made a very nice and balanced product.I bought the complete system with the charging/cleaning/air dry/sterilizing base. As with any electric razor it does not cut as well after the first 20 cuts.So when they tell you the blade last 18 months it only cuts as well as a new blade for about 3 months.Replacement blades are around $25.
2,Not too impressed,"I am used to shaving with a Norelco 3 head shaver and decided to purchase a Braun. Here are the results:Pros:1. Cool factor2. Cleaning station works well3. Keeps good chargeCons:1. Noisy!2. Odd shape and difficult to hold3. Heavy4. Cannot shave neck areas well at all (I have already shaved 10 times with it, so it is not training)5. Cut hair falls down (have to shave in front of sink)6. Price - not worth the price (incl cleaning station)"
5,LOVE THE BRAUN SYNCRO SHAVER,MY HUSBAND HAS ONE OF THESE SHAVERS THAT HAS LASTED SEVERAL YEARS AND HE ENJOYS SHAVING WITH IT. HE NEEDED A NEW RPL SO WE WENT WITH THE SAME ONE RECONDITIONED. THIS ONE SEEMS TO BE A NEWER MODEL AND WORKS GREAT!
2,Not enough,"This is the textbook used for the introductory statistics course for engineers at UC Berkeley and while it has some merits there are other textbooks that are better for the purpose:If probability is the emphasis, Jim Pitman's Probability does the job.If an overview is desired, then Purves' Statistics book will work.The homework problems in Devore's book are of moderate difficulty but the explanation isn't any more detailed than that of a high school level statistics course (with the exception of continuous random variables). The book has some computer examples but does not discuss uses of computing packages like Matlab, R/S-plus, SAS, etc.Unless the textbook is required for the class, for reference purposes try other textbooks for your dollars."
5,You Won't Regret This One!!,"When I first saw the preview for this on The Disney Channel, I was not too thrilled. Though I love Bridgette Mendler on ""Good Luck Charlie"", I just wasn't sure about the movie. Then I started to see some of her videos, and realized, hey, this girl can sing!! So, I rented the movie on DVD and I have to tell you, I'm very glad that I did. I liked it so much that I ordered the DVD combo pack from Amazon.com the very next day.This is a very fun movie, with lots of laughs and tons of heart, not to mention some awesome songs.So don't hesitate, this one will have you tapping your toes.Lemonade Mouth (DVD + Digital Copy)"
5,"Slow, sensual mood that leaves you wanting more...","I truly love this CD. I've had the movie for a long time but it is only recently that I bought the soundtrack. I regret not doing it sooner. The music completely captures the film. I love the whole ""mood"" that is created. I would love to find something that is comparable to it. So, if you have any suggestions, email me."
5,Sultry Seduction,"This original soundtrack truly eminates the sensuality of the movie. The slow tracks like 'Makambo'is truly haunting. And this soundtrack has the theme-song, which is a great, fast Tango!!!"
3,A mix between Never Never Land and Set the World on Fire,"Whereas Alice in Hell and Never Never Land were all out thrash fests, King of the Kill is a more subdued, riff based and groove oriented album. Still 100% METAL though (could Annihilator be anything else?). There are some ballads here and there but they are mostly well done and rather cool in their simplicity. Towards the end more speed metal numbers are thrown in (Alice in Hell lite, ha) but my favorite songs are the heavier ones, like The Box or Annihilator. Cool cd."
5,Flaky salty goodness,This salt has great flavor and even better texture. Is excellent sprinkled over anything you want saltier. Steamed veggies or even a hard cheese.
2,Maldon Flaked Sea Salt,"I read an encouraging review so went for it. Others may appreciate it; I did not.For it would not work in my salt mill. I would turn the mill several times, yet but little salt would come out.I needed larger crystals."
3,And it was all a dream.,"This has some hot scenes if you like things a bit nasty, but why oh why does the author describe hot scenes time and time again and then reveal the acts were only occuring in the heroine's head. This is disappointing and the equivilent of a child's story being only a dream. This is a work of fiction and fantasy so why not make things really happen? It was very annoying. There are only about two sex scenes in the book that actually happen in real life, the rest is in the heroine's head.Why?"
5,"If you like guitar,you'll like this!!",What a shame about Roy. The liner notes tell a more comlete story
5,This is a fantastic shaver at a fantastic price,"I have had this for a couple of months now, and I have no complaints. It replaced a Braun Flex Integral that refused to stay charged. The Syncro gives the best shave I have ever got! It shaves very smoothly and quickly. The head moves from side to side as well as up and down, so somehow that makes it more efficiant.This is the best electric razor I have ever used."
1,Won't Stay Charged,Works great when plugged into AC but won't function after about two days in cordless mode (won't stay charged) w/normal use.
1,Bad move on my part,"With my five year old Norelco overdue for replacement I went hunting for a new razor. Based upon the reviews given this razor, and the price, I decided to give it a try. Bad move on my part, it does not shave nearly as well as the old Norelco. I will never make the mistake of buying a Braun again."
2,My God,Why would anyone buy a factory-reconditioned Shaver? U must be out of your mind to use something that has come into contact with someone else's bristles.Yeech. In this case I rather pay more and have the peace of mind that its only my bristles clogged in the machinery.
3,improper packaging,"The book is Ok for the money. Wish it had more color pictures and more about US owned aircrafts, not foreign.The last 30 pages or so got wet in transit as a result of the abismal packaging used (with open ends cardboard).The book is actually ruined as a result and must be returned.The packaging, although costly for what it was, was useless in protecting the merchandise."
4,Good Resource For The Money,"As a subscriber to the ""Where To Retire"" magazine, this is a compilation of their retirement site articles but provides an one source stop for retirement information."
3,It's Johnstone,"Johnstone is Johnstone...either you like him or you don't, he keeps it just interesting enough and cheap enough to keep me buying."
3,It works,"What can I say? It's a tie down. Seems strong and I don't think it will break or slip, but haven't tested it yet."
4,Overall review,"This is an overall review of Serenty... I have to give it four stars... terrible art, terrible dialogue of how teenagers don't talk, cheesy as all hell... It is so bad it is awesome... I can't help but laugh at everything done wrongnow of course, the story is weak in the beginning, but near its end, it ends sort of on a strong high note... and it teaches a good lesson... that even though you have changed into another person... you are still you and you don't have to be someone your not."
1,Lies,"First off, this is not a manga. The common meaning for the term 'manga' in America is used to mean a comic of Japanese origin. This, being written by a Korean-American could hardly be classified as manga.Serenity also, despite the sickly residue of insperational material, is not in any way cutting edge. ""Good Girls learns the error of her ways"" is hardly new or interesting.I found this to be an insult to my hobby and America as a whole."
3,Mickey Slips,The watch is a eye catcher but hit it just right Mikey slips from his spot causeing watch to stop non repairable
1,Hed Kandi?,"This cd is mistakenly classified as ""house"". I am an old ""house head"" & I can tell you that it is nothing more than very commercial dance music. I am very disappointed in this marketing deception. Thanks to the housenation & keep on keepin' on!"
1,Don't believe the (considerable) hype ...,"Never have I seen so many glowing quotes and press clippings about an author. Never have I been so utterly bored by a book. Dunnett's highly self-conscious, thick-as-molasses writing ""style"" reads like a very bad first draft. The most painful of Dunnet's many instruments of torture are her action sequences; rather than racing along as an action sequence should, Dunnet turns thoughts, words and deeds that should be happening in a matter of seconds into a page or two (or three) of thick, glutinous, unreadable mess.As for the hideously mangled and unnecessarily complicated multiple plot lines, if anyone has read this book and claims they can remember from one page to the next what is going on, they're lying.Avoid."
1,The Game of King's,"Could not get into the story due to a million references that I had no idea what their meaning was. I read where folks either love it or hate it, I was one who did NOT like it. Disapointing b/c it came highly recommended by a friend."
1,Wordy but lacking the talent of Shakespeare,"I have an excellent vocabulary and have read several Shakespeare plays, however this book is super wordy. It almost seems like she goes above and beyond, searching out words in a thesaurus. I hated this book and I am easier to please then most. I couldn't even finish it."
4,great historical fiction,"I had heard about Dorothy Dunnet a few years ago, but I was not able to find any of her books, even haunting used bookstores. When I saw that they had been re-released in paperback form I snapped up _The Game of Kings_. I have not been disappointed.This is the story about one of the most complicated characters (Lymond) I've ever seen. Dunnett makes her readers hate, love, and respect him. I have been reading this book with a dictionary at my side, because the language is so rich and unusual. I plan to read the rest of the series, as soon as I can get them."
2,Couldn't Deal,"I am an avid reader of all kinds of books and have an advanced degree in literature and I have to say, this book was just TOO MUCH WORK. It seems like there was a grand plot in there somewhere, and I know people love this series, but I simply couldn't follow it -- with the arcane vocab and extensive use of untranslated foreign languages...sure, I'd slog through it if it were a class assignment, but after 200 pages of wondering if I'd had a head injury which wiped out my reading comprehension skills, I gave up."
1,Good Subtitle,"Whatever happened to common sense is exactly what I wondered while reading this collection of shotgun blasts. The most telling thing about the book is that Rush Limbaugh thinks it's great. If you trust ol' Rush's scientific judgement, this is the one for you.Dr. Ray had been a scientist at one time and it's too bad she gave it up. A former teaching zoologist, she nonetheless feels qualified to write about atmospheric mixing, stratospheric photochemistry, and the laws governing land use. It's sad when a scientist stoops to namecalling. Here's what she has to say about ""Silent Spring"" by Rachel Carson, the environmental writer: ""...an emotional, lyrical, and grossly unscientific and inaccurate book...."" ""...Rachael Carson's hysterics....""If you're trying to sort out what's true in scientific issues from what isn't, and don't care about personal feuds, look elsewhere."
1,Dreadful -avoid this if you love this band,"Sfter the live album 'Close Encounters with the West Coast' (aka 'live From Tokyo') , the FBB's numerous live recordings are a minefield.This CD features the circa 1985 lineup of Skip Battin, Greg Harris, Sneaky Pete and Jim Goodall. The sound is generally very poor, Harris' vocals are shaky and hoarse and overall I'd suggest even fans of the post-Gram Parsons Burritos should avoid this.For a far better document of this lineup, invest in 'Live From Europe' instead, which sounds much, much better."
3,No strangling the dancers,"You have seen it a million times from ""Freaky Friday"" (Disney) to ""Vice Versa"" with Judge Reinhold. This movie is one of the most formula stories around. So now it boils down to if you like the acting style and the ""one liners."" Or if you just like to ogle young girls and extra hairy guys.The basic story is simple. A person who in intentionally rude, but unconscious of the rudeness, soon will find tables turned (gaining or losing an appendage in the process) and learn to feel for the other person. Then again it is the story of making mugging and dancing a little easier if you have the right body.For an excellent version, that excels at exchanging bodies, watch ""Goodbye Charlie."" Debby Reynolds did not have to act like a baseball player to emphasize the change."
3,CAVEAT EMPTOR: It's not actually a widescreen version.,"In spite of the fact that this special edition is advertised as ""widescreen"" in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the actual DVD is a full screen version in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. All the claims on the package about this being widescreen are completely bogus. The only good thing is that it is remastered and is visually superior to the earlier versions.At the moment (January 2011), this is the best version there is -- but again, it aint widescreen. CAVEAT EMPTOR."
3,Chariots of Fire - Two-Disc Special Edition,"Unfortunately, this is the prodcut that I ordered but not the prodcut that I was sent. I was only sent the one disk DVD which I already had. I was looking forward to the additional material that would be on this DVD. Obviously, I can not provide a review."
3,Great film - poor quality DVD,"This is a great film. The film tells the story of two Olympic runners with very different backgrounds and motivations, but who end up on the same team. There are some powerful moments in which the viewer feels the drive, force and determination of the athlete and the basis for that drive and determination.Unfortunately, the quality of the DVD is poor. It's grainy on the HD screen and not released in wide screen yet. Being that it won Best Picture at the Academy Awards it is a marvel that this film has not yet been released as Blue-Ray or some better quality DVD. It just doesn't play very well on HD sets."
2,"not compatible w/USA dvd players, so why sell it here?","not compatible w/ USA dvd player, so why sell it here? i paid for shipping and return shipping and twice rec'd a dvd playable in the UK."
1,Believe us...,"Please believe us that this DVD advertised as ""widescreen"" is indeed just the full screen with the top and bottom cut off to make it look widescreen. Very false advertising. The movie is, of course, one of the best ever made - especially about sport. This version, however, is not satisfactory!"
1,Call me when it's widescreen,"I keep looking for my favorite movies on DVD, and look forward to buying this flick-- when it's finally released wide-screen. Can't imagine what dolts at Warner Bros. were thinking in not at least giving a widescreen option on this flick. I have the same question about why they released Bonnie & Clyde full-screen."
1,Wide screen format needed,"Just in case I may be able to influence future releases, let me just say that I (and probably many others) will NEVER buy a DVD movie if it does not offer a choice of wide screen viewing !! It does not matter how good the movie is. It's a good thing that I still have my laser disc player."
4,Excellent Film But Overpriced,"Great film that won an Oscar but shouldn't have considering the monumental 'Reds'. Overpriced and I'm wondering how many times they have to collect the same dollar on the same real estate. I don't know if anyone's noticed but the older films are not as sharp on blu-ray as the newer ones. In fact, there are some that were so good on DVD that blu-ray is not much of an improvement, if at all. There was one film that I was going to buy on blu-ray but didn't because the DVD was that good. Trying to remember which one."
3,DVD a Disappointment,"Purchased this DVD on impulse, often a big mistake. I should have checked the customer comments on Amazon first. Many others have commented on the fact that it was released in full-screen format instead of widescreen. Also, my copy is of fairly poor quality in general. The picture has black blips and white spots flashing throughout the film, as you often see in theaters when the film is old. And through much of the movie, there is a black smear in the center of the screen that is very annoying and unsightly.This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and what a disappointment the DVD turned out to be. I would think it deserves to be released in a cleaned up version and in widescreen format."
4,Incarnation of the hymn that inspired the title.,"Less of a ""review"" and more of a reminder that the title ""Chariots of Fire"" is derived from a turn-of-the century English hymn--Jerusalem--that raises the question: Did Jesus Christ visit the British Isles??? The text of the hymn provids a valuable insight into the spirit of the film itself."
2,VERY BORRING,"I LOVE THE SOUND TRACK OF THE MOVIE, OTHER THAN THAT THE MOVIE TO ME WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,IT WAS DRY AND VERY BORRING. I RATHER WATCH THE OLYMPICS."
4,A Childhood Favorite,"When I was a little girl my grandmother got Red Mittens from a church rummage sale. It was one of my favorites as a child, because of it's wonderful writing style and lovely pictures. I was recently talking to a memeber of my book club about it and found out he is Laura Bannon's nephew. Though Laura is now gone, I'm sure her books will be loved for generations to come, buy those of us who know and love her work. I will surley pass down Red Mittens to my children, it's a unknown classic!"
5,Great self-teaching tool!,"I chose this book because I hadn't picked up a guitar in years, and I had never known more than how to play a few chords. This book takes you through how to read music and play the guitar right from the beginning, but it's also a wonderful review for those who already have some experience. It's very clearly written and easy to use for those who want to teach themselves to play. I highly recommend it."
5,"Excellent Guitar Method, Excellent Bargain","I have been using the Hal Leonard method with my guitar students for several years with great success. This spiral bound edition of books 1,2&3 is a great bargain. Not only do you get all three volumes for less money, the spiral binding makes playing and teaching much easier since it stays flat while on the music stand.If you are just starting out, the CD offers a great chance to hear what you are actually trying to learn, and with a little self discipline you could improve your skills a great deal even without an instructor.Great product!"
4,Hal Leanard Guitar Method,"My 9 and 7 yr old boys are both taking their first guitar lessons and it seems ok....the CD is a bit confusing..I couldn't tell what music it was corresponding to at first because it was going too fast. It should say ""now we're doing sample #1"" etc. I like the idea that all three books were together."
5,"If you want to learn music, start here","When you take it upon yourself to learn the guitar, the very first thing you must decide is whether you want to learn music, or you just want learn enough to jam with your friends. If you're only interested in playing at bonfires and jamming in your basement, look elsewhere. If you want to learn both how to play the guitar and why the guitar is layed out the way it is, then this is where you start.If you just want to jam, then getGuitar All-in-One For Dummies. If you want to master music, then start withHal Leonard Guitar Method, Complete Edition: Books & CD's 1, 2 and 3."
2,It can and did get worse,"""Enemy of my Enemy"" is the second book in the Spirit Walk series and the fourth book in the Voyager relunch sereis and it seem to get worse. Now Captian Chkotay and his sister are being held by a changling and a changling is in control. But, of course Janeway knows this and she has sent Tom Paris to save Voyager and her crew.I have to say at this point, I am reading any Voyager books from my local library, because I can't see spending money on this books. As I said in my last review, die-hard will love this books, but others may want to skip this books"
1,disappointed,I was planning to buy Mr's May's Almonds and Cashews but they were out of stock at amazon so I decided to buy Sahale's Sing Buri and Soledad. Did not like the taste of either of them. Highly Disappointed. Will wait for Mr's May's to be back in stock.
2,Not for me,"I really like several of the Sahale products, my favorite being the Valdosta blend (almond/cranberries). This one, however, is not going to be one I'll buy again. Given all the five-star reviews, I was expecting these to taste MUCH better than they do. While not too sweet, the strong vanilla flavor overwhelms the flavor of the cashews, pomegranate, and apple. I love vanilla, but there's just too much in the blend for me. I bought the pack of six and wish I had bought one pack to try, instead."
5,great snack,We were glad we were able to purchase this sanak from Amazon. It is difficult to find in stores. It is delicious and nutrious!
1,Too salty,Looks good but this is too salty. They can reduce salt without making it less tasty. Hope they make this change.
4,Guide to ranger school,"Ever wanted to become a US Army Ranger?Well, this book will tell you what to expect if you join the ranks of recruits who hold the hope of becoming a Ranger.This pictorial book will start where the first change occur when we sign up for duty in the armed forces; the haircut! From there it take the reader through the process of training a raw recruit from a civilian life to the life of - not only a soldier - but a US Army Ranger!We will follow recrutis through the Ranger training, on the firing range, parachute training, patrolling at night, and not to mention the demanding physical opstacles that has to dealt with, if you want to make the pass as a US Army Ranger. The pictures take the reader close enough on the recruits so when you finish the book you can almost say: been there, done that...well almost!The reader will get a good knowledge about how the life of a Ranger recruit is.Read it before you sing up, if you do not want to be taken by surprise!"
5,No words can explain,"Dear Amy, do you really want to hear or see Pinback on MTV with the rest of Americas fake recording artist? I doubt it..."
3,"Nice story, not well told","This is a wonderful story of the religious and other cultual interchanges in central Asia a thousand years ago. Unfortunately, Mr. Foltz does not have the ability to tell that story in an engaging manner. Foltz, he admits this, digests a huge amount of information in order to tell this story. The result is that it is not enough for the academic specialist and not well enough told for the generalist. Thus the text suffers. Still, as a short text that introduces the whole realm of the religious history of central Asia, there is much to be learned. This text is only a small taste of the variagated history of the area."
5,Fram CH6007 Oil Filter Motorcycle,Excellent quality. Fits my CX 500 just like the Honda filter. Better qualty and price than the WIX 24938.
4,my fish seems happy,"I don't know what much to say.. it's fish food, the fish are ok, they seem healthy. I have a guppy farm. Seems to be prospering fine."
4,Very good - not great,"Definitely best when you see it for the first time, because you just don't know what happens next. It's a slow bit paced, so sometimes it makes your mind wander. My big complaint is that they left out LOTS of great footage from the final. I have a tape of the extra footage, and it would definitely have made this film much better (extra scenes include Troy getting shot with a .45 revolver, wrestling with bears in the junk yard, Troy on the Roseanne show/Canada AM/interview, him getting hit by a pickaxe, etc...). I live near Troy and have gone up north to gold pan too, so technically it's pretty realistic. The soundtrack is good and editing job also, but some scenes drag on with people talking about things you really don't care about, that don't have much to do with anything. This is still probably the most entertaining and uninformative documentary ever."
3,"Some good stuff, some bad stuff","This compilation of Taste's four albums (2 studio, 2 live) contains the best of Taste's work, particularly the scorching 'Same Old Story' and the raucous blues 'Catfish' (from the excellent 'Taste') both of which have Rory Gallagher wrenching fantastic licks from his guitar. Unfortunately it also has several tracks from the dire 'On the Boards' (Taste's second studio album - I was SO disappointed when I bought this in 1970!) including 'Its happened before, it'll happen again' which was Gallagher trying to play jazz. This track starts off promising but disintegrates into an embarrassing attempt by Gallagher to play alto sax. Thank goodness he didn't do much more like that. Overall its worth buying as it shows the wide range of styles in Gallagher's early career, and as the albums from which the tracks are taken are no longer available its a valuable addition for anyone interested in collecting Gallagher's work."
3,"Neither complete nor encyclopedic, but still a nice work...","I was really hesitant to give this book only three stars, because it actually is very well-written and quite nicely illustrated. My main objection to the book is its scope, reflected in its slightly misleading title. In a well-intentioned effort to write a comprehensive one-volume reference, the author glosses over too many principles which a beginner should learn in detail, and skims over (or omits) some essential information on advanced topics.As a broad overview of home aquarium science, the book is great; as a reference for either the beginning or the advanced aquarist, it will likely prove to be of limited practical use. Someone who is just starting out would do far better to purchase one or two of the many good beginner's books offered on this site. (If you're reading this, it means that you're checking the readers' reviews, which is probably the best way to find the most suitable books for your needs.)"
2,Thorough but out of date.,"Book is from before 2001 and was missing key fish now widely available for purchase for a freshwater aquarium. Book arrived in fair condition, Not bad considering it was on old Library copy. More pictures than information. I was hoping for a book on how best to keep a freshwater tank, not as a reference to species and compatibility."
4,Great for Lunch Boxes,"This is a small muffin mix. The package says it will make 5 standard sized muffins; however, I use it to make 18 mini muffins for lunch boxes. As other reviewers have noted, the blueberry chips are artificial, and not real; however, I don't find that this detracts from the taste. Note that to make these more nutritious, I always use only 1/4 cup water and 1 egg instead of the 1/2 cup water the package calls for. I also stir in 1 tsp of powdered milk with the dry ingredients before I add the liquid. To make them a little fancier, you can sprinkle a little sugar atop each before baking; the kids love it!"
1,bad in taste,"Even though the pack says ""Whole Cashews"", inside the box are mostly halves, pieces and crushed cashews.The pack says they are good until 10/2008; still there is such a severe smell of oldness we are having to throw the whole case."
1,Wish I had read S. Elliot's 1-star review,"With so much glowing praise over the vibrant colors and picture quality of the new transfer to Blu-Ray, I was excited to watch this on my 60"" plasma TV. Oh so dissapointing. I thought for sure that I had a bad transfer, until I read some of the other 1-star reviews which clarified the situation. The entire film--except for some brief moments after they get to the Emerald City--looks grainy. It's especially noticable during the sepia bookends and whenever there's a closeup of Dorothy (you'd think she had smallpox as a child). My wife never noticed it until I pointed it out during the closeups, but it was obvious to me the entire time. I haven't seen many BD films, but I was impressed with the color and quality of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and was hoping for something at least equivalent with the Wizard of Oz.If you're a videophile and have a large TV, you'll probably be disappointed."
5,Wizard of Oz,Excellent move for the whole family. You don't have to worry about sex or language content.
4,A classic,"Great film classic...if only it were on Blu-Ray. Oh well, the up convert will do in the meantime."
3,DVD Quality,DVD was in good quality but the case was a cut out of another movie case disappointed in the quality of the package.
4,Great Picture,Just as I remembered. Enjoyed seeing the theatrical version in our home. Recommend for all with grandchildren. Our grand daughter loved this movie.
5,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz...,"Well it had been many years since I had been 'off to see the Wizard' and it was well worth the wait, as this version certainly is the 'wonderful wizard of oz' as the quality was excellent and the color extraordinary vibrant. If I didn't know better I'd say it was blu-ray. This version is beautifully restored and the detail it reveals is more than I've ever seen before in this movie and I often felt 'I never noticed that' from the rivets on the tin man to the detailing on the munchkins costumes."
5,Why it's not in Widescreen...,"I've read a few negative reviews here complaining about this release because it's not in the widescreen format and wanted to explain why. This movie was originally released in 1939. Movies weren't shot in the widescreen format until the 1950s. Widescreen was a format used by Hollywood to combat a new form of entertainment that they feared would put them out of business...television. This is why television originally had the aspect ratio of 4:3, because it matched the aspect ratio of movies at the time. There was a ""fake"" widescreen version of the Wizard of Oz released in 1955, but it wasn't true widescreen, how could it be since the master prints are in the 4:3 aspect ratio? MGM simply cut the top and bottom of the picture to fit a widescreen format. Fortunately, this version hasn't seen the light of day since it's release in 1955.Just wanted to clear that up for people wondering why there's no widescreen format."
4,Great Classic,It is great to have this movie back in our house. My kids have seen it before and love it when it goes from the black and white to color. This is still a great family movie and it will always be one of my favorites. And the box it came it (from Korea) is somewhat of a treasure because the kids love that it is in a different language. The only thing I don't really like is that we have to keep changing the subtitles but it is worth it just to have it on DVD and in great technicolor!
5,The Wizard of Oz is a classic!,This is simply one of the best movies ever made. I watch it over and over again. I have the original Wizard of Oz but I don't have the new one. I wanted to see it in theaters but I didn't have the time. When I was growing up I watched it all the time and I still do. It's a great movie!
1,Horrible Color Tech,"I purchased this Blu-Ray version thinking it would be great. I have watched this movie hundreds of times; I even have copy of it on my DVR at home. However, I wanted to own the DVD. Unfortunately, this Blu-Ray that I received is very poor quality indeed. Dorothy's dress is orange or red, and the faces of the characters are green or blue. Other color backgrounds, etc. are very poor quality. I am attempting to send this back for a refund. Hated it...color quality wise."
1,The Blu-ray version is grainy and is no better then standard def,My family and I are huge Wizard of Oz fans. We bought this Blu-ray format collector's edition thinking that we would be blown away by the visual clarity of one of the all time best movies ever produced...didn't happen! This supposed Blu-ray disc looks no better then the standard definition version! I recommend that you save your money and steer clear of this rip-off!
1,Wizard of Oz,"I'll just get straight to the point. This is one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. The acting is poor, the songs are stupid, the whole plot is completly stuffed up, and the filming is terrible. Take my advice. Dont waste your time renting this out. Read the book instead. Its alot better"
4,"It was okay, but not as good as the book.","It was great, yet not as good as the book. They cut off certain parts of it which made it rather boring. I don't mean to insult anybody, but I'd much rather recommend the book. So sorry to all of those who liked it. Still, for what's it worth, the acting and everything was great."
5,Wizard Of Oz - Fun for the whole family,send me an email if you need this video. i have a couple (syberbob@earthlink.net)
4,As Good as it Gets!!!!,"The Transfer of this movie considering that it is 70 years old was beautiful. I have never seen the colors so alive in this movie before. From the yellow brick road to the Lolipop Guild, the colors jump off the screen. Sure there is some film grain, but that is to be expected for a movie that is 70 years old. They did what they could to restore this movie back to its orignal intent. My hats off to Warner Bros for restoring a landmark of a movie that will be a favorite for the whole family.The Wizard of Oz (Three-Disc Emerald Edition) [Blu-ray]"
1,No Captioning of Special Features,"This review isn't rating the movie, which is a favorite of mine. It is rating, rather, the entire boxed set. Outside of the movie itself, the special features are not captioned, and as a hearing impaired person, I cannot enjoy or easily follow what's being said. I was especially disappointed about this because I've waited years for ""Dreamer of Oz"" to be released on DVD. Anyone with a hearing loss is better off saving his or her money and purchasing just the movie alone."
5,do this if you wanna see sumthin sweet...,"watch this movie with pink floyds cd, ""dark side of the moon"" playing in the background. make sure the movie is muted though...good bye...have fun..."
3,"I Love This Flick, But...","I'm giving the DVD release three stars simply because they refuse to put the film out with an aspect ratio that matches the original release. All the other bells and whistles are great, but this omission is glaring in the studio's consistent refusal to take advantage of the technology that is out there. There is absolutely no reason to release this movie without the widescreen, and less reason to buy it, all the pretty packaging notwithstanding."
5,"We're Off to See the Movie, the Movie called Wizard Of Oz!!!",GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!! PLOT YOU CAN BITE RIGHT INTO!!!!!!!!!!WONDERFUL MOVIE FOR ALL AGES!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"product good, packaging busted","all contents in packaging intact, and the box shipped in was also fine. The Green Display box that holds everything was broken at all four corners. It looked like it was on the bottom of a pallet and got bumped many times. The shipping box was fine which means it didn't happen in transit from location to my house, the distributor/shipper KNEW it was broken."
1,Movie disc would not play in my DVD players or on my computer. Disc of extra features played just fine.,"This was so strange-the movie disc label said it was for region 1, but the disc would not play in either of my DVD players (different brands) nor on my iMac desktop computer. The disc of extra features played just fine. This is the first time that I have ever had a disc that would not play. The seller's service was prompt, & the discs were in very good condition. I did not contact the seller because I figured that it would cost me more to return the set than I had paid for it in the first place."
4,FAVORITE MOVIE,"This is my favorite movie along with the new version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It is almost exactly like the book except for they don't put stuff in that was in the book. I liked the movie, but the ending was kind of dull. It got kind of long, too. but something about gets you addicted and you watch it over and over and over again.Dorothy (Judy Garland) had a beautiful singing voice and made the song ""Over the Rainbow"" famous. My mom and I both agree that no one sings it better. All the other characters were good too but I like Judy Garland. I do think you should read the book after the movie."
2,Too far on restoration,"Sorry...but was all hyped up for the new and supposedly faithful restoration...then I watched it.Remember in the bonus materials, the one tech guy says something along the lines of ""well, we could do more, but you wouldn't recognize it...so we didn't.Really? Then explain to me WHY the string swishing the lion's tail in the KING OF THE FOREST song is now no longer visible? Especially when it's been EXTREMELY visible in every other incarnation?Yep....the string is gone...and, yes, it's probably the type of thing they would have removed in the day...but they didn't...and changing it NOW....is changing the film.Why stop there? Why not correct Judy's changing hair length? Or redub the ""little bug"" line?Great color....but leave it alone. Ever since I was a kid the string on the tail tickled me...and removing it is removing a small piece of Hollywood history."
5,A Great Purchase,"This was a Great Purchase. It arrived quickly, and in absolute PERFECT condition. I had ordered this first on Netflix, and they could never send the correct 2nd bonus disc. They just kept repeating discs that I had already seen from the 4 disc collection. After 7 tries I decided to just buy this set. Boy was I glad I did. I bought it for $7.09 US, and with shipping, I spent less than $10.00. I must say that Netflix was kind enough to give me $16.00 off my next bill, so you can say they bought this for me. This is chocked full of many wonderful extras that I had never seen. This is a must have for any fan of this classic movie. The digital restoration of the film is remarkable. Order this now. You will not be disappointed."
5,Blu-Ray Wizard of Oz,This movie is timeless and the HD version leaps off the screen. It's almost like watching a new version. Some of the non-verbal queues I've never noticed before.
1,collectible queen,"collectible queen removed my money for this purchase over a month ago, but never sent my movie. I sent her an email the day after the last possible arrival date, and never got a reply. When I contacted amazon, I was told I had to wait even longer to file a claim. The email even implied that I was somehow at fault because I didn't look at her reviews. When I did, I saw that she has done this to several other people. I don't understand why amazon continues to allow her to rip off their customers. I will probably never order from amazon again."
5,Spectacular,I was flipping through the channels one day with my daughter and came across The Wizard of OZ and my daughter became instantly mesmerized. I purchased this DVD and it is amazing how awesome it is. A great classic movie updated and fine tuned to todays high def times!
4,Wizard of Oz Blu-Ray,Disk was full of extras; unfortunately most of them already available on the DVD released a couple of years ago. Still worth having.
3,Confused by reviews since the BluRay version has not been released,"I am confused by the reviews since the BluRay version has not yet been released. While I understand the expression of feelings about the movie in general (VHS and DVD) as well as the nostalgia associated with the movie, how can this be considered a legitimate review of the product since no one appears to have actually seen this version? By the way, my family loves this film, I rated it because it was required, and I will most probably purchase this version."
4,Grand kids love it!,Our 8-year old granddaughter asked for it for Christmas. She LOVES it and invited us to watch it. We enjoyed seeing it again after nearly 60 years! Her 5 year old brother likes it too!
5,Fun for the whole family,I've been watching this movie since I was a baby! I would watch it 2 or 3 times every day. It is a wonderful and magical experience and I love it. It is still my favourite movie!!!!
5,Love it!,One of my all time favorite movies. I was excited once it came in almost four days earlier than expected. The picture is great and plays very well.
5,It arrived as promised.,I purchased this video as a gift. It arrived as promised and the person I gave it too is enjoying it.
5,"Beautiful, but problems with special features?","Having purchased my set awhile back, I am just now getting around to watching some of the special features. When watching the older Wizard Of Oz B&W titles on the disc 2 special features disc and going back to the main menu, it won't allow me to select any other titles. In order to get back menu control, I have to fast forward to the end of the feature I'm watching and allow the disc to return to the main menu itself. Also, the ""Dreamer Of Oz"" movie, looks terrible, with ghosting that looks as if watching a 3D movie without glasses. Since other here have commented on the great quality of that TV film, I can only assume I have a defective copy? Anyone else had trouble?"
5,Just the ticket to the show,Good product Great service Wonderful employees. I appreciate what they did to fulfill my Christmanss list.No complaints at all...
4,the extras were disappointing,"Though the film has been cleaned up to the point where it's simply astonishing, I bought this chiefly for the extras on the second disk, which I found disappointing and anemic.Specifically, I thought there were a whole bunch of deleted scenes that were included. No such luck. There's some cruddy footage of a jitterbug dance that was omitted, and an extended version of the Scarecrow's ""If I Only Had a Brain"" dance, but little else. Nothing revelatory here."
5,A true classic.....especially for Pink Floyd fans,You thought this film is great on its own....try watching it with the volume turned all the way down while listening to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. Pause it just before the first song and after you hear the third lion roar in the very beginning (before the movie begins) unpause the cd. You will be amazed!
3,Disappointing Blu-Ray,I'm rating this as a Blu-ray NOT the movie. The Wizard Of Oz is one of the very best movies ever made. This Blu-Ray is not as as good as I had hoped. A lot of Blu-Ray movies are so sharp the picture looks like liquid. Don't get me wrong even the worst Blu-Ray is still better than regular DVD but this is not as sharp as some other Blu-Rays I have watched. It's good but not great.
3,Blu-ray Wizard of Oz Emerald,"This review is based on the Blu-ray 3-Disc Emerald Edition only. It is not a review of the film.While this movie is a clear Classic, this Blu-ray edition does not provide any better picture quality than the regular DVD. Perhaps the sound is better and the extras are better, but overall I was not happy with the picture quality as it was not a vast improvement. I have since given this set to a family member as I do not plan on watching it over and over.If you want to add to your Blu-ray collection, this set will fit in. If you already have the regular DVD, just keep it and don't waste the money on the Blu-ray."
5,Wizard of Oz,"I bought this movie for my 3-year-old grandson. I was a bit worried that he would be frightened of the witch. Fortunately, he wasn't and he LOVED the munchkins. Great purchase for me."
1,Too grainy,"I haven't watched the entire movie yet, but the few minutes that I watched (both B&W in the beginning, and later full color scenes) are way too grainy. I was hoping the digital restoration and transformation into Blu-ray would be much better than this. For a classic movie that's seventy years old, with today's technology, I know it could be better. The movie gets five stars of course, but I gave one star for the poor quality."
2,Strictly kids fare,"Cute story, poor acting, poor directing, terrible singing....but then you know that. The DVD transfer is sub-standard. Picture quality is acceptable, but not better than VHS. Turn off your surround decoder or the whole movie comes through the center channel. I realize that this was a mono movie made in 1939, but surely a little time could have been taken to give it an AC-3 soundtrack. No extras on the disc worth mentioning. One more note: original theatrical presentation doesn't mean widescreen in this case. The original aspect ratio was close enough to 4:3 that the DVD was pressed as 4:3. Buy this disc if you don't mind your kids playing with the DVD player, otherwise wait for Ted Turner to broadcast it."
2,DVD for wizard of oz,the quality of divd was not very good for the price i paid i just did not have a very clear picture
4,And your little dog too!!,"If you want to expand DVD collection, this is a must-have. I mean, who wouldn't want to have this timeless Amercian classic. This DVD had everything from production notes to home movies. Though it lacked 2 major things. An audio commentary and a widescreen presantation. But anyway...The people at Warner Brothers digital remastered this movie so well, you can actually see the cheap piece of string that makes the lion's tail wag!! [Oops. Was that out loud?]. My point is that this is a great addition. BUY IT!!!"
3,Wizard of Oz,"The DVD arrived in great condition, my 2 year old niece loves the Wizard of Oz she watches it over and over."
2,Normally these shoes are good quality,"I have purchased many BCBG Katchen Shoes on line from Amazon. This is the 3rd pair of this shoe I have purchased in the last three years. I wear them as daily work shoe.Unfortunately, thie entire sole of this last pair came off within 3 weeks of wearing them. It was neither snowy or rainy. It was surprising as this shoe has always performed very well for me and BCBG is top quality. I wonder if Amazon had very old inventory in stock where the glue on the sole was separting.I was quite disappointed. But if you can get a normal quality pair, they are great. They look good and are very comfortable. I have never had an issue in the past and would still recommend them for women working in the office."
2,run VERY small,I love the look of these but they are very uncomfortable and run small. I ordered an 8 which usually fits but was tight in these shoes.
1,"Not worth the $$$, very disappointed","These shoes came as a rec. from a friend who swears by them. As a girl who has to dress in business professional attire everyday for work I was excited to try these. I have not even had them for 2 weeks and the metal is already worn through the heel, mind you I am 5'11"" and thin. I have shoes from Target that are better made than these! The heel looks chewed up and the bottoms are almost worn. I am not on my feet a whole lot so I can't see why these shoes would already be as worn as they are, except for being cheaply made. Other than that, the out side of them looks nice...but if I could return them I would. Not impressed BCBG!"
3,The bag serves its purpose but is very unwieldy,"I bought this bag to carry my laptop to and fro from office and since it provides an extra large pocket, it lets me carry a few other items as well. The shoulder straps have nice cushion built into them. The bag serves these main goals.However, it is pretty ungainly. I use NYC subway to get to office and you cannot easily keep this bag in your lap. The bottle holder has been provided too much to the side and hence if you bend a little to the side, the bottle will fall off. In addition, the bottle holder does not have any straps (and the built in elastic was pretty bad) and thus you can keep only one size of bottles in it.The bag is also pretty heavy and hence after the laptop and adapter and few other small items, it is a pain to carry it around.I would recommend this product for an occasional use and not for a daily use."
3,Fits my notebook wiith unease,Good bag.My own did not include the phone pouch as advertised on Amazon.I usually have difficulty getting my Toshiba P25-S509 to fit into the bag. I have a feeling the zip of my bag won't last because of the strain I exert on the zip to get my Toshiba to fit in.
3,I bought the wrong battery,"...But I managed to make it work.I accidentally chose this battery because my eyes were glazed over from looking at so many different models trying to figure out what was compatible with my 20+ year-old Panasonic. The seller doesn't help by specifying the model it works with, it's on the back of the package so he knows but the buyer doesn't. It's a fullsized pack 3xAAA instead of the half sized 3x1/2AAA that I needed. It worked out since the plug fits and the electrical specs match and it's NiCD not NiMH; only the size didn't match. So, I plugged it in, jerry-rigged it with a rubberband to the outside of the phone and charged it up. :D So, for less cost than a correct replacement battery (TL26156?), I managed to make it work on my phone.Also, don't be tempted to get a cheaper NiMH batter. For cordless phones, you'll want a NiCD."
1,Sent Wrong Battery,"This is the battery I wanted but did not get:Nickel-Metal Hydride Cordless Phone Battery For Uniden BT-446But this is the one I got and it doesn't fit at all:GE Cordless Phone Battery for Panasonic/Uniden Phones (TL26154)I would like to have the real one but how do I get it?Thanks,Roland HiltscherSenior Citizen on Social Security"
1,Non-compatible phone battery,"This product was not compatible with the phone we use even though it clearly stated that it could be used with a Uniden phone. So, the battery is now in a pile of unused batteries we have stored away just in case we ever find use for them."
1,What was Sham thinking?,"Geez was this horrible . It sounds like a British band covering Huey Lewis and the News songs.Seriously , the songs are terrible , I try very hard to be open minded when a band changes it's sound for the better , but most of these songs were just cheesy dance music. But I guess the band saw their mistake because the album ""The A Files"" which was released 10 years later captures the original Sham 69 sound , but avoid this unless you like Culture Club , and Huey Lewis and the News."
5,Meco 9309W Electric Grill,"This Meco Grill is the best and the most convenient grill I've ever owned. Its very quick at cooking with little to no chance of a fire build up, like with charcoal. I am very satisfied with this grill, I plan to always do all my grilling with a Meco grill."
1,disappointing,"it did not worked for me, I still have pain in my ears from the drops after 24 h , there was nothing coming out and due to the pain as after affect I am not going to put the drops again in my ears , the syringe ball is not really unpractical for my ears eater , i feel like wasted my money with this product ."
5,Great!,"I love romance Western style. This one is a great read. Sexy, fun and touching. Baker's work is way up there on my list of favorite romance authors, along with Brown, Howard and many others including my latest fun, sexy read ""Anything, My Love"" by Cynthia Simmons. These ones can keep you turning pages, and Baker always does."
4,Good CD,"This guide was helpful because of the CD-Rom. If you're planning to take the CBT Praxis, and have never taken Reading, Writing, and Math tests on computer, you need this guide. It will allow you to answer questions while being timed. The functionality is close enough to make you comfortable with the real test. I took all three on one day and passed all with scores 3 - 5 points above the required score for GA. The material is a couple of years old but the methods for reading, writing, math are current.For updated material I used Arco 2003 Praxis I guide. It was useful but the CD in this guide was essential for my passing. I wish this company would update their cd rom and create a guide for Praxis II."
1,This book was a waste of money for me,"I bought this book from Amazon.com before I had to take myPraxis test. Passing this test was an absolute necessity for me inorder for me to get my NH Certification in Guidance Counseling. I studied from the book, especially the math sections, although briefly. I found that the questions and problems in the book were nothing like what was asked on the test. And in spite of the book I still passed anyway! Yeah! My suggestion: find another book."
5,Outer Limits,For the sci-fi lover this is a must for your collection. Many of these shows are classics.
4,The Outer Limits Volumes 1-3-Box Set,"I am so looking forward to getting this set...I was 11 in 1963 when this series began its short run and, for its time, it made a huge impression on my social conscious...we had emerged from the peaceful 50s and JFK had not been assassinated at that point...very prophetic material...loads to make you think about morality, ethics, scruples...lived a short life because it provoked when no adult wanted that post Great Depression, Post WW2...then along came the Smothers Brothers and Laugh In...comedy permitted that deeper look...buy this series...so worth it...The only hold back on this series is the packaging, It would truly seem that a great series as this the DVD should not been made so cheap, you open the dvd, no information on the inside, and the DVD are Side A & B....I much more would of paid for ""Quality"""
3,Good for its age,Quality of video is good. Special effects are terrible...as expected for its age. Entertaining as acting and stories are fine.
5,Awesome Series!,"My review is short and sweet. This series is the best, along with Twilight Zone, that has ever been on TV."
4,Outer Limits 45th Anniversary Edition,"A single release of this 60's SciFi series was a welcome addition to my DVD video collection.A recent visit to the local best buy clocked the series at nearly $100 for the three individual volumes. BB had this new single set priced at a savings of 50%.I was impressed with crisp clean EZ to use menus. The B/W video and Mono audio quality was excellent.I did miss bonus extras, and the lack of closed captions for those of us with less than perfect hearing was also sorely missed.Others have mention problems with the double sided discs. My toshiba DVD player had NO such troubles. Either disc quality has improved, or maybe these other people just need to upgrade their hardware.While the ""monster"" FXs are very dated, the stories have held up well over the years. All in all, enjoyable to watch.4 stars."
1,Defective DVDs,"MGM has released these DVDs in two other packages, and they are defective. I've bought two complete sets of these DVDs. After you remove them from their case a few dozen times the center begins to crack. Even the ones that don't crack, fail. After about six months they start skipping and freezing. One just failed tonight. If you look at the surface of the DVD it is perfect, yet it skips and freezes. I take care of my DVDs. I don't have any problems with any other DVDs, just these MGM Original Series Outer Limits DVDs. They have failed for me on many different DVD players. I recommend not buying (since the manufacturer has already received money for millions of defective copies), but have someone make a copy for you, provided their copies haven't failed yet."
4,Do not attempt to adjust your set...,Hours of TV philosophy 101!This collection offers my students a glimpse of post WW2 and Cold War fears... let the metaphors fly.
1,This product is bad,"I do not like this product. It has to many bugs in it. It breaks down, I stayed up to 3:30 A.M. with it, I'm stil working on it."
5,Great Version,"Stable for general use and dual booting a PC, if you need to run programs that need DOS but also want Windows, try this."
1,Should Be Callled errors 98! buy windows me instead,This Program I dont advise buying it has all kinds of bugs and windows update you see like one million critical updates that eat your hard disk space and it throws up blue screens all the time and almost every time i try to install anything it throws a error at me or some other thing at me and i have to restart my computer all the time and my computer has 128mb ram 40gb hard drive and a 700mgh pc and almost no matter what pc you have windows 98 is not worth the hours of headache is causes it's just not a stable OS and if you feel like throwing your money away buy windows 98 but i finally got windows me and it works great so dont buy windows 98 if you have it buy windows me
1,The worst OS on the market.,"Microsoft Windows undoubtedly is the worst popular OS on the market. It is unstable, unreliable, not secure, and contains the worlds most bugs."
1,"""Wal Mart Returns"" , here I come!","Mine only worked two times then began to shut off after only a few minutes . . . has plenty of water, too. Luckily I got it from Wal Mart who will take anything back."
2,poor layout design,"My beef is with this particular type of layout of the prongs/outlets. It works fine until you into plugs that are longer. For example, because of the layout of the plugs, the longer plugs will take up (i.e. cover up the other plug-in holes) more than one slot. Stay away from this type of layout, i.e. the holes should be oriented 90 degrees the other way so that longer plugs will not get in the way."
4,Bon Jovi - Raw,"I bought this album 15 years ago while I was still at school. Having already bought ""Slippery when wet"" and ""New Jersey"", I found this album to be quite the treat. Having been released before the massive commercial success enjoyed by the band on the release of Slippery when wet,7800 Farenheight is a rare glimpse at Bon Jovi's original attempt to classify themselves as ""hard rock"". It is worth a listen, if only to chart to progress of their music - although there are a few good tracks on there like ""the hardest part is the night"" and my personal favourite ""The price of love"". Following their first albums ""Bon Jovi"" and ""7800 Farenheight"" the band mellow out significantly, taking on the identity of Pseudo rockers, or soft rock, rather than the original raw attempts. Like diamonds in the rough, the first 2 albums are in need of a little polishing. However, 7800 marks the first step towards the rest of Bon Jovi's remarkable career."
5,Great if you want to learn the basics,"This book is great if you want to learn the basics of relational database design in a non-platform dependant manner. Some of the information may seem useless, such as the interview process, if you are just looking for designing a database for your own personal use. In a business environment this essential. As an individual who had not messed with database design since dBase III+, I found the book quite useful as a refresher and an excellent warm-up for more advanced books."
1,Size/Fit a big problem,"I wear a 10.5 EE shoe and these socks fit tight out of the package. After washing the first time they shrank to 5 1/2"" from heal to toe and 2 1/2 in height. Had to give them away after one use. Someone with a size 4 to 7 and a narrow foot may want to give these a try."
1,"Good idea, poor design","Summary........good idea, very poor implementation. Good software and easy to use, major problem is reception of radio stations. I live in a major metropolitan area and have to practically stand on my head to get the radio shark to get clear reception (even with a plug in antennae)."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7,"Below is the transcript of my help chat with tech supportRadioshark: Welcome to our real-time support chat. How can I help?AL: [10:02] trying to record program via scheduled recordings, all i get is 1kb file of nothing. running win 7 64bitRadioshark:[10:03] So sorry to hear about the trouble you are having with that!Radioshark:[10:03] How long have you had that?AL: [10:03] about a month, when i first startred it it recorded fine[10:04] i can schedule soemthing 5 min from now and it does fine. does it have something to do with sleep modeRadioshark:[10:04] That is very possibleRadioshark:You can try setting the computer to not sleep.Radioshark:Also, RadioShark isn't actually compatible with Windows 7, but if you continue to have problems with that, here are a couple links that should helpAL: [10:05] That would be a problem securitywiseAL: [10:06] Did you just say Radioshark is NOT compatible with win 7?Radioshark:[10:07] Correct"
2,"Poor reception, even in the heart of Seattle (but worth a try)","The most basic capability of this device is receiving radio signals, and in this area it gets just 1 star out of 5. In Seattle (Eastlake Ave, Lake Union area), I get just a couple FM stations, and 2 or 3 AM stations. Luckily NPR (94.9 KUOW) comes in very well, otherwise I'd have returned it.The user's guide is informal but clear, and the set-up on a Mac/G5 was easy and quick. The software is quite good (no problems at all). Griffin follows Apple's iTunes shortcuts, which is nice attention to detail.If only this device would receive more radio stations (seems pretty basic - how long have we been doing radio?!!) it would be a winner.I'm glad that I have this - and will keep it - since it gets my #1 favorite station.It's a worth a try, but keep the packing materials as chances are high you'll need to return it. Good luck."
3,frazzled,While a good purchase. It is limited to a few racing games. It only becomes excellent if you have the encoded games.
1,Not for me!,I viewed this DVD for maybe 10 minutes before rolling my eyes and turning it off. I purchased it for an adult friend who said he loved it. I guess I don't understand my friend.
2,Over the top,"Cut out all the disgusting pieces, and you might have a good 15 minute bit on the Comedy Channel."
1,Bruno,"I really wanted to give Sasha Baron Cohen the benefit of the doubt while viewing this film. I really wanted to understand what he was trying to say. In my humble opinion, this film is disgusting through and through. Except for the VERY short part of Bruno going to interview a supposed terrorist, this film should be rated X rather than R. It is a porno film rather than the smart interesting social commentary I expected. I think i will never watch anything done by Sasha Baron Cohen again. Creepy.. just creepy..."
2,"Funny? No, not so much.","I understand that this childish movie was supposed to be funny and intentionally offensive, pushing the boundaries of the rating system. But it was just ok. I snortled a couple times. I supposed if you like Punk'd and celebrity practical jokes, this might be your movie.The one thing I can really appreciate is how he got people into the film and attempted to twist it into the story. But the story itself around Bruno was a huge let down - including Sacha prancing around like an arse. Whatever. Sacha, you owe me 1 1/2 hours of my life back, you moron. Or maybe I'm the moron...I can't give it one star because I did choke on the full hour and half (nearly) of it. It was like watching a car catch fire along the freeway."
1,Do not watch!,"This movie is simply horrible. I loved Borat and found it hysterical. However, this one does the exact opposite. Instead of exposing homophobia in a funny and light hearted kind of way, Burno creates more homophobia and affirms ""gay stereotypes"". I feel this movie portrays homosexuals in a negative way. This movie only reinforces what homophobes already think and feel. If you like watching an hour and a 1/2 of literally penis in your face, and this idiot running around half naked (or completely naked) then this movie is for you. What he does is not funny and quite harmful to the homosexual community."
1,Sexual Harrasment is not that funny,"If you need to expose yourself in order to expose bigotry, you're really just provoking it. And thats all the Bruno character does. The movie tries to win a few laughs by trying to corner heterosexuals with an overdose of homosexuality. If you laughed at certain parts of this movie then you think sexual harrasment is funny. Poor taste, the movie is trash."
1,The Worst Ever!,This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. No lie. What a waste of $3.99 for the rental. Save your money. ZERO stars!
2,Didn't like this one so much,"I like his films but this wasn't so funny. The one with the dictator was really funny, but not this one."
3,Another Borat,It's Borat recycled. You have to be a big Bruno fan from the Ali G show to like this movie.
1,freedom of speech?,"Sometimes I wonder why we put our soldiers in harms way to defend the freedoms of our constitution. This video is a gross unpleasant defense of the right to choose homosexuality, or a defense of homosexuality as nature. I don't mind homosexuality, but what a waste of time, money, and energy.... Pick up a book and read."
2,Borat at least had a point,"Honestly, I'm quite a fan of Borat. No, I don't sit there and make a weekly appt with my dvd player, but it was funny. It was real life with a plot point on how close-minded some Americans are and how different cultures act in different circumstances. Brüno, however, seemed completely pointless. I suppose the underlying plot was how people react to homosexuality (and sex/censorship), but the way it was presented was not at all like Borat. It just seemed like he wanted to make a movie with a lot of male genitalia flashing about. I laughed at some parts (hence the 2 stars), but mostly was just wondering why he was doing what he was doing and when the movie was going to be over. Too bad. :)"
3,"Tiny player, Nice picture","This new RCA model is quite generic, but ideal for small spaces.No front display for time/function etc. and not many features, but pretty nice for a lower end unit."
5,Excellent compilation!!!,A bunch of great retro arcade games including mk 2 and 3. Narc is a great game and this is the only compilation where Hard drivin actually works right! I like that game. Lol. Even if you don't it's still a must for fans of retro arcade games!
5,great little machine,"Compact, quiet, great suction, and suction control options. Simple to use. The telescopic wand is great, as are the 360 degree turning wheels. The two different temporary housing slots for the wand make stopping and starting during the vacuuming session easy. The design of the Miele in terms of maintenance is simple and effective.The only cons I can see are that the tool storage on the wand sometimes gets in the way when you want to vacuum under furniture; you need to take it off. Also, the on/off switch is not always very responsive."
4,"Not what I was expecting, but...","I liked this book, but can't say a I loved it. I was expecting a passionate romance and got frustrated halfway through when I realised I wasn't getting it. Only later found out that Heyer's goal was to make it different from the historical romance formula and write a more realistic love story of a couple trying to make the most of a less than ideal situation, and learning that a relationship based on friendship and loyalty is more valuable than being head over heels in love.When you put it in that light, you see that Heyer was successful in her intent and you will enjoy reading about a tender and mature love story and its three dimensional characters, specially Jenny."
2,download trailer then you've seen all the good parts,"From the trailer you can gather what the story is aboutFrom the trailer you can see all the funniest scenesFrom the trailer you can figure out how it all endsFrom many other reviews you can see this is a movie not worth renting, which was disappointing because I do like both the main actorsThe fact that Hollywoood is AGAIN remaking what is normally a superior movie is a sign you should stay away from the remake and just watch the original. The only exception to this rule this year would be War of the Worlds."
3,"OK FILM, HAS A FEW GOOD LAUGHS","i think that i went into this film with high expectations, and alas the movie did not meet those expectations. all the best parts seemed to be captured in the trailer. mostly through the movie it seems the audience is expected to handle filler dialogue until the movie can get to the next joke. bernie mac and ashton kutcher do a pretty good job bouncing the comedy off of each other. i think that the movie could have been a lot worse but on the same note it could have been better also. the rest of the supporting cast is very solid and gives the story a well rounded feel to it. since this is a remake they made an honest effort to differentiate from the original by trying to make this a more comedic movie rather than one of social commentary. i think that this movie could still portray a social message in todays society and still have been funny. this is still a good movie and i am not trying to knock it in any way, but i feel that it had a lot more potential."
2,"I didn't really like this, not much at all.","This is a rehash of Guess Who Is Coming To Dinner, but it has oppsite qulities to it, It has Ashton Kutcher take the place of Sidney Poiter and the plot is that Bernie Mac and his wife expect their daughter to bring home a rich, wonderful, black man, but she brings home a white ""boy"". The jokes were stale, and reminasint of Meet The Parents. They really fell flat on their faces, Bernie Mac outacted Ashton in practically every scene, hands down. He was getting most of the laughs(or chuckles) out of me. He was really showing off his comedic talent, while Ashton was not. I thought that the title of this movie was ridiclous, and didn't tell us anything. The racial jokes were not that funny at all, and I found some offensive, even to blacks and whites. There are more better choices out there than this movie. I recommend you go to those."
4,A happily good and funny movie.,"Pleasantly surprising is the fact that there is a bona fide story told in this movie so that even amidst the laughing -- and you will be laughing plenty -- a plot unfolds in a natural way, advancing on its own, undeterred by the jokes.This is the first time I saw Ashton Kutcher do any meaningful acting. About time. His efforts receive valiant support from Bernie Mac's skill at taking the load off him. Mac puts in another pretty good performance as an actor, and by also assuming the heavy lifting as the antagonist, he makes it easy for Kutcher to look like he knows what he's doing.Whoever was in charge did an artful job of keeping the comedy flowing while making it help the story unfold rather than hinder it which is all too often the case in contemporary romantic comedies.It exceeded my expectations. I'm sure I'll watch it again sometime."
4,Guess Who???,This is a funny film worth the watch but im not too sure it's one that will be watched over and over again
3,"Predictable, but has its moments","Bernie Mac's daughter is bringing home her boyfriend just in time for her parents' 25th. wedding anniversary. They expect an upwardly mobile black man, but what they get is Ashton Kutcher, a bumbling white man who has just quit his job. The plot is predictable from there on, and Mac reacts in just the way you would think he would. The low points come when Mac decides to sleep with Kutcher to keep him from nighttime visits with his daughter and when Kutcher teaches Mac to do the tango. Better scenes pit the two men against each other in go-carts, and show their apologies in front of all of the women's friends. Mac's over-the-top style is nicely complemented by Kutcher's understated reactions and the basic messages in the movie are communicated pretty well. Not a bad movie, if you're looking for a gently amusing film."
3,Review,"When I first heard of this film, a remake of an Academy-Award-winning classic, I expected a cheesy comedy with a sweet romantic supporting character, some funny moments, a U People comment, and two funnymen who aren't funny. Well, guess what. This is what I got. The film isn't aiming to be funny, it has funny situation(or so it seems) and we see how characters react. This film, was predictable and anyone who was expecting a good-racial film should have another thought before seeing this film. As far as I can understand, it isn't a racial issue any longer, more of a social issue. But this film is one of those No.1 films that tank down later to No.10, with no 3D character develoment.I suggest that if anyone has already missed this film, then don't bother. It may be good for a Friday-night laugh, but don't waste your time."
2,"I Hate Commercials, They Make It Look Good.","I hate those reviews on tv that keeps saying, BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR, TWO THUMPS UP, they're saying it so much I wanna get violent. I'm watching it pure basely on the commercials and probably the actors. That guy seems to be only THAT good on the 70s show. Outside, ehhh, not so great. Bernie is like one of those black guys you don't ever wanna argue against, big mouthed and full of bs. Only knows how to argue back.Even so, the movie was sort of funny, but still, failed miserably for how I expected it to be. I remember when movies were about quality and not so much about the $$$. Movies nowadays are mediocre and sometimes, just a total waste of time. Only a rare view are good..."
3,Disappointing,"I thought that this movie was going to be a lot funnier than it was. Actually, it sucked. There were some parts of the film that made it an o.k. movie. Like the part where they're all sitting around the table was kind of funny. All of the funny parts of the movie were already in the previews on T.V, so that kind of ruined the film. So, I would recommend this movie to people who are bored and there's nothing else to see the movie."
3,Meet the negroes,"After the first 15 minutes, I was ready to shut it off. I gave it a little more time, and it got a lot better! I don't know much about the original, but I do know that this one had a lot of funny parts in it. When Simon was telling his black jokes at the dinner table, that was hilarious! Get through the first 15 minutes, and the rest is great."
2,Colossal Boredom,"""Guess Who"" is a film I watched in three halves. It's difficult to sit thru this film in one stretch. Much of the humor is infantile and not funny at all. The only funny scene in the film lasts for around ten seconds and features a taxi driver who's not even a part of the plot. This is by far Ashton Kutcher's worst film. I thought Butterfly Effect was simply amazing but with ""Guess Who"" he fails to make a faint impression. This is easily the most skip worthy film I have seen in a while. It lacks humor and falls flat on it's face as far as acting,direction and screenplay goes.Watch this film if only you must see every Ashton Kutcher film out there for some reason transparent to me. Cheers."
4,Anatomy Of An Illness`,"Cancer,and other alignments, patients discover there is hope......just add laughter and belief..Let the mind/spirit forces cure you........."
4,"Anatomy of an Illness, as Perceived by the Patient","Norman Cousins has written this book that will benefit any long-term patient. His observations on the benefits of keeping a positive attitude are very useful. His recommendations on taking large amounts of ascsorbic acid should be taken with a cautionary note.My used book arrived with a bent cover and several dog-eared pages, but was otherwise in good condition."
4,Funky Grooves with Silver Service,"Horace Silver delivers once again with this 1960 Blue Note album. While this is not quite in the same league as ` Song for my Father' and `The Tokyo Blues' (hence the four stars), it still contains some solid finger poppin' tracks, which became the hallmark of this great jazz pianist and composer. With an all-star ensemble such as Junior Cook (tenor saxophone), Blue Mitchell (trumpet), Gene Taylor (bass) and Roy Brooks (drums), Horace Silver couldn't go too far wrong. Together they bop along with funky grooves such as `Yeah' and `Nica's Dream', but for mine the more laconic `Stollin' remains the standout track. This polished quintet certainly would have been one to have seen live, but for most of us the Rudy Van Gelder recordings will just have to do, as they provide a unique glimpse of their generally under rated talents."
2,Disappointing,"I was really curious about Angela Davis,but I found this book really boring. It seemed really clinical and dry. I've read alot of autobiographies,and this one was really disappointing. She never really opened up."
5,Angela's Lessons,An exceptional book told only as Angela Davis can tell it. Reading her powerful statements about that time in history makes what she says even more important. My daughter attends UCSC and I suggested that she take a course from Dr. Davis or at least attend her guest lectures on the campus. We need to learn from the lessons she teaches us ....tolerance...yeah some folks pay lip service to that concept...read this book with your heart and mind.
2,Great food processor - except for this part...,"The Kitchenaid food processor is priced well at the top of the range available in Australia. It's worth it in terms of power. However, the most used accessory, the bowl, is as others say...not well designed. On mine the handle has become separated from the body and needs careful jiggling to get it to engage the switch. I am afraid it is becoming unsafe. Of course it's now out of warranty, so I'll have to purchase another bowl.In addition to this problem, the handle itself has filled with unsightly mouldy food remains impossible to remove in dishwasher or by hand washing. It should either be sealed, or solid, or dismantle-able.The manufacturers should have a good look at these faults as they are spoiling their reputation for reliable appliances!"
3,Monk Season #6,"We miss Sharona, she was funny, energetic and brought excitement to the series. Natalie is like having a Beagle but Monk is Monk so we did buy this season to complete our set."
2,"Cute, but not very functional","I thought this salt pig would solve a problem. We often measure salt in our palm and then decide it's too much. We were keeping a bowl near the stove to put the extra into. The pig is cute. However, unless you pick up the pig and tilt it, it's pretty hard to put salt into it. The little spoon that comes with it is useless. The handle is too short. The bowl of the spoon is too shallow to be useful. It does keep the kosher salt reasonably dry."
3,interesting experiment,"This CD is pretty good. It's kind of tame, but that is understandable because, according to the notes, Monk had to study the sheet music before he could perform it. The liner notes said before he even started recording the music for the LP/CD in the studio, Monk was acting like he wasn't exactly familiar with some of the songs. So, with the CD, we can hear Monk a little reserved due to the fact he was working off his memory of written music-if he wasn't reading the music as he was playing/recording it, that is (some of which he may have been familiar with, listening wise-Ellington's music was popular). So, sometimes, it is ok to hear Monk not flying away on the piano, if there is an understandable reason for that."
4,It's still a good season,I am subtracting 1 star because -as mentioned before- Seven absolutely sucks.The rest of the episodes are still great though. I love the one about the Senior Olympics and the regular cast is still as funny as ever.
1,Oh the humanity!,"Married with Children - The Complete Seventh Season was a complete disaster. The writers brought in a confusing and unnecessary new character, a little boy named Seven. I couldn't believe how boring this new addition was, they quickly dropped the boy but the show was never the same. The writing had become really vile, childish, and just plain unfunny. This show was always a little raunchy and pushed the envelope but it became a joke and I lost interest halfway through the season. Season 7 is definitely a train wreck, seasons 1-6 are the ones I highly recommend."
4,More adventures of the Bundys and the D'Arcys,"In the 1992-93 season,this FOX sitcom's seventh,Shane Sweet is inaugurated into the cast(but not thru the series demise) as Seven,a mischievous kid abandoned by his weird,dysfunctional parents(their behaviors and demeanors are similar to those of the Bundys). The father is portrayed by the season premiere episode's guest star Bobcat Goldthwait,who himself is somewhat weird and dysfunctional. Al(Ed O'Neill) and Peggy Bundy(Katey Sagal) welcome Seven to the Bundy household with open arms. Kelly(Christina Applegate) and Bud(David Faustino) now have a foster brother. The Bundys' next-door neighbors Jefferson(Happy Days veteran Ted McGinley) and Marcy Rhoades D'Arcy(Amanda Bearse) adore Seven as well(odd name for a human,don't you think?). Marcy is still loving her second marriage to Jefferson who sticks with her thru the 1997 cancellation."
1,Inaccurate.,"I thought that this scale was going to be good news. Well, it wasn't. You can step on the scale and each time receives a different weight. It also read almost 4 pounds heavier than the doctor's scale. Don't buy this scale."
1,Went Backwards,"I purchased this unit with expectations it would exceed the capability of my 6 year old Char Broil Patio Caddie. After three uses (salmon steaks, beef steak, hamburgers) I confirmed it was inferior in every way:- max interior temp was 75 degrees lower, thus much slower cooking.- shims were necessary to level the cooking surface.- a 15 inch high flame flare-up occurred while removing just two hamburgers.- cleaning the reflector plan was very difficult; if not cleaned to bare metal the cooking temp would lower still further.Further, it took three communication attempts(fax, email, telephone) with Meco to evoke a response, which didn't address my questions.This unit is now for sale at the local Goodwill store and I am happily back with my well-built, dependable and safe Patio Caddie."
1,Horrible quality,"I bought this product. The second time I used it the volume control broke. I can't adjust the volume. So I returned it for another one of the same model with the manufacturer. Three days later, the same problem, the volume control broke. Horrible quality product. The manufacturer should pull the product and address the problem."
3,Audiophiles beware!,"Looking for a relatively cheap ipod speaker dock, I chose this one since it looked fairly attractive and simple. The quality of the main dock is not bad at all. Fit and finish is on par with the more expensive docks, however, the remote is absolute garbage.By no means is this a terrible dock physically, but the sound quality has left a lot to be desired in my opinion. The dock sounds kind of like low quality computer speakers at best. Very hollow and flat sounding with little fidelity. this was a major disappointment to me. Because of that, I usually only listen to podcasts on it. (Which is fine since I love my podcasts also.)I would say buy it if you plan on sticking it in the garage, or other work area, but don't use it as your main external speaker source for the ipod if it's going into the living room, or somewhere other people might hear it."
1,Lasted 2 days,This product lasted two days before the volume got stuck on maximum. It's electronic so there's no way for me to turn it down now. Useless item.
1,Where is the product?,"I bought this product through Amazon from supersavingsusa. I never received it. After more than a month, I have requested a refund."
4,Nano Speakers,"Most adequate, a good 300 bucks cheaper than the ones yiou can tell the difference in sound from."
5,Great tasting candy,I bought this candy as a gift for someone addicted to coke and trying to quit. I also tried it and its great tasting and has the fizz of a cola. It also lasts a long time in your mouth. Its a great treat.
4,very good,A Passonate story about a woman torn between two men and a ravishing love that she just couldn't forget. Unforgetable tale.
2,"damned opening,good ending!!!!!!","for the first time i saw it,3 words lived in my mind:bored,stupid,cheap.........but then,at the end of the movie,i think different:it's a sweet movie(just at the ending!!!!)so i don't like hilary duff too much,she's too fat&her; voice got something like britney,she's try to be like britney........i don't like this movie,it's not real for teen even it's have a little bit cute....so if you are want to have real movie,real romantic,you must watch what a girl wants movie!!!!!!!"
1,I nominate this movie for the worst movie of the year award!,"If there was an award for the worst movie of the year The Lizzie McGuire Movie would win with out a doubt. A monkey could have written a script with a thicker plot. The movie from the beginning was very predictable and cheesy. It had no substance. Anyone who liked it only liked it because Hilary Duff was in it. The movie itself was nothing like the show Lizzie McGuire. Lizzie's best friend, Miranda, was not there, Kate, Lizzie's enemy was nice, and Ethan, Lizzie's not so smart crush, was actually acting intellectual. All in all I would rather watch grass grow than see it again."
1,one word GAG!!,my friend dragged me 2 see this movie and i eventually agreed i spent 8:50 on a peice of crap like this and do u know why lalaine wasnt in it because of hilary duff's bad attitude on set she thinks she was better then everyone else because she was the star lets see where that went
1,Worst Movie Experience Ever,"I rented this movie on Saturday with a very open mind. I watched it on Saturday night and thought it was the worst movie ever! The acting is mediocre and the plot is equally bad. I normally like the show so I'm not a Lizzie McGuire hater, but this was an extreme disappointment. If you want to have respect for Hilary Duff do not watch this movie. It is so horrible it will make you want to cry. The plane ride to Rome was the highlight of the movie and the clothes were pretty cool. Oh, and how Lizzie ignored Gordo the whole movie made me annoyed at her, but I guess the end for them is as good as it's gonna get because it's Disney."
5,one of the best movies i've seen,"this movie is truly oscar worthy. Not only is it fun to watch, but you learn a lot of interesting things in this movie such as history of rome and a ton of different morals. i highly recommend this movie to anyone who watches the show and enjoys movies with a surprise and sweet ending. I couldn't have thought of more unpredictable ending! it was wonderful!"
5,Lizzie in Italy!,"Disney Channel has had a hard time adapting their pre-teen series into movies, but The Lizzie McGuire Movie was an exception, despite the fact that the character Miranda was written off.Lizzie and her best-friend Gordo along with Ethan, Kate, and their other classmates go on a school trip to Italy! Lizzie is mistaken for Italy's biggest singer, Isabella, and Lizzie falls for Isabella's singing partner, Paolo. When Isabella goes missing before an upcoming event, Lizzie must learn how to lip-sing and act like Lizzie. Meanwhile, Lizzie's little brother, Matt, knows the truth about Lizzie. He convinces his parents that he misses his sister and that they should go visit her.The movie is not perfect, but it is a clean-cut family film."
3,"Cute, but not as good as the series","This was a cute movie, albeit implausible. In some ways, it's a young girl's dream. I missed not seeing Lalaine as Miranda, and wondered why she wasn't in it. In addition, I wanted to see more of Sam, Jo, and Matt. However, I loved the parts with Matt and Melina together. I missed Lanny Onasis (Matt's silent, but profound friend), Larry Tudgeman, and Claire too. Lizzie's graduating class sure looked different from her class on the series. Plus, there were too many ""explanations"" and discontinuities. When was she elected secretary/treasurer of the student council? And, she didn't get to go to the spring fling dance.Hilary's performance was okay;Yanni's performance was stereotypical. The supporting cast rocked, actually.All in all, it was a nice way to end the series. I don't see how they could've made an effective sequel, so I'm glad they stopped here."
2,"Not Real, Hilary","Okay so if I go to Rome will I meet some famous singer and ride around on his red motorcyle? Not in real life! The idea of the movie was fine but once it was made it is horrible compared to other movies like this. Sorry, well not really because if i truly was sorry i wouldn't be writing this :o)"
5,Love,I loved the series and the movie growing up decieded i wanted it so i got it. The shipping was great the product was sealed and not damaged it was a great purchase
5,Lizzie mcguire,I love the Lizzie mcguire episodes. I also love the movie. I love the parts when Gordo and Lizzie kiss and when paoula sets up Lizzie to sing and be famous. I love LIZZIE MCGUIRE FROM ADAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Boot sizing is wrong.,"If you are considering buying these overboots I would suggest trying them on at a store first. I wear size 11 shoe and purchased the size XL for(11-12.5) shoe and ther is no way they will fit over them,and they are a sneaker! I found the boot localy and tried the XXL size and barely got them over my shoes because the tight ankle area,and when I did finally pull them on and walked in them they were very sloppy in the toe area--enough to make you trip on the extra rubber at the toe!"
4,"Tough to size, but nice design and construction","I ordered a paid of X-Large overshoes for my size 10.5 and 11 dress shoes. The overshoes ended up being really loose once on, but I'm worried that the size Large will be difficult to slide on. These X-Large overshoes are just too loose though.UPDATE: Ordered a pair in size L and they work great. Nice construction."
2,overshoe rubber boots.,"Received large size as ordered. I wear a size 9+ and these boots will NOT pull on over my shoes. Very tight fit. They bind at the top open end when trying to get shoe to go in. So i cut the top 4"" off and they now go on easily. A totally poorly designed product. Dont buy."
2,Unrelible,"The quality of the ink was inferior to original EPSON cartridges. Also not all of the cartridges did work at all, or worked with lines on the images. I would never buy this product again."
5,Truly captivating,"I became a huge fan of the band's music after seeing them play in Manhattan about 3 years ago. At the show, I purchased their debut album which completey blew me away. Over the years I have seen them perform many times and have anxiously awaited their follow-up album. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. In fact, I found myself brought in many unsuspecting directions with this new release. I have never heard an album that captured so many musical styles while at the same time orginating a totally new sound. If you can appreciate rock/jazz music with a depth that is rarely found these days, I highly recommend this album."
2,Misguided required reading for CS students,"Most people who purchase Deitel books do so because it is the required course material for their CS (pick a number) class. Deitel book are needlessly saturated with filler material that do not justify their extremely high cost. You could easily save your money and learn Java by going through the Sun tutorials which are FREE, not to mention the countless online Java tutorials out there (just do a Google search ""Java Tutorials""). Stay away from this book! If you have to buy it, then please save some money by purchasing a used book."
4,B. Traven,"I am half way through the six ""Jungle Novels"" and I find that Traven is a bit of a mixture of Hemmingway and Steinbeck, with a James Michner approach to historical narrative. This is the best way I have found yet to see inside prerevolution Mexico; to understand why it happened and why Mexico is the way it is, in many ways, today still the same."
4,A revisit of the New Orleans jazzy sound,"Here we have Elvis present a new approach on the New Orleans sound, a far cry from ""King Creole"".The title song, an old American classic, is actually given a powerful treatment and it holds pretty well on the top of the album.Later on we receive songs that do not instigate any exciting listening experiences and the case is certainly made for ""Petunia, the gardener's daughter"". Still, the out-takes of even that tune provide a fresh look for avid collectors. A gypsy-like song by the name Chesay is sheer pleasure and is wonderfully mastered by Elvis. As far as the ballads go, in this album we are treated with more than the usual one or two. ""Beginner's luck"" and coming near the end strong and emotional ""Please don't stop loving me"" are real cult classics that command repeat performances.Do listen to the overall out-takes because they vividly colorize the recording set and let you in the making process of the album."
1,misled,"new york yankees ""franchise""fitted mlb cap (blue) (x-large) ordered the hat believing it to be and extra large adult hat for my husband . received the hat and found to be much to small . found out from jr's sports that the ad hadnt been clear enough and that it was a childs size . was offered to return or get a 20% discount on another item .as i had given it to my granson i couldnt return it and had no desire to purchase anything else.i felt misled and with no options that would have not cost more money."
2,Too tiny and too loose,The stud was as described. The backs were so tiny I could hardly hold them to put them on and then the first time I wore them one of the backs came off and was lost.Sybil
1,Can't get it to work,I threw it in the trash. Could not get it to work on Mac Os X. What a waste of shipping $!!!
3,"Powerful, but doesn't hold a blade well","I bought this to put in a new gable vent in my garage. The wood is mostly plywood, so the jigsaw had no trouble making short work of it. The unit is very powerful and cuts with ease. It also is fairly quiet for a jigsaw. The vent in back of the unit for hooking to a shop vac is a nice touch, but what takes the grade down a notch is the blade holder. Blades are held by two Allen screws, which need to be extremely tight or the vibration alone will loosen the blade during a cut. Needless to say, I would have preferred a quick turn and connect piece instead. If it wasn't for that, it would have five stars. It takes most u shank blades just fine, just make sure you stop and re-tighten now and then."
3,"A very good value, but the blade holder needs improvement","I was impressed with the power, easy handling and ergonomic design of the saw, but the blade retention device needs improvement. The blade is held in place by two socket-head cap screws (i.e., ""Allen bolts"") and those screws need to be TIGHT, otherwise the blade isn't going to stay clamped for very long and WILL work loose. Also, this saw did not come with a hex (Allen) wrench for changing the blades. Most other power tools that require a wrench for changing the blade come with a wrench specifically for that purpose. Overall, a good value for the price. It is easily twice the saw that it replaced in my shop (a Craftsman top-of-the-line from 1987) Had it not been for these minor problems, I would have rated it 5 stars."
4,Career retrospective on a single disc,"The COFFEE & BOSSA collection for Sergio Mendes is a bit of an odd one as it represents three different periods of Sergio's career. There are tracks from the old A&M; Records Brasil '66 days intermixed with his Brasil '77 period on Bell Records, plus some tracks from his '80s days back at A&M.; What's odd is that two different music giants own this stuff, so having them together on one disc is somewhat of a treat.This disc comes from Universal in the Phillipines, so perhaps some oddity of international rights law is what's allowing these to be compiled together. And I've read somewhere that this disc has been withdrawn, so if you can find it, grab it.The outer package is a Digi-Pak with just a track & publishing listing inside. The disc is encoded with CD-TEXT, so you can see what the song title is on CD players so equipped (mostly in cars)."
4,"""Rummie"" Gets Even","This is a rip-roaring book of poetry from the always trenchant lips of Donald H. Rumsfeld, our Secretary of Defense and sometimes Zen master and kitchen poet. If you've tuned ""Rummie"" in during one of his press conferences, you'll recognize the stamp of an extraordinary, original thinker. These encounters have been gathered by editor Hart Seely, something of a poet himself. Truth to be told, some of the poems are retreads of previous poems in the book, but that's okay because what Rummie has to say -- and the way that he says it -- is worth repeating.And Rumsfeld gets his turn at the ""microphone.""My son gave me this book for Father's Day, and having just finished it I say again: Thank you."
5,The best album of Bon Jovi,it's naturel...best of Bon Jovi with its music and also lyrics.. best of Sambora also with its super tones..not only stupid meaningless fast licks that most of the guitarists can do..the solo of 'my guitar lies bleeding in my arms'is wonderful also his acoustic solos in other songs are very good both in tone and in music...because it is not a commercial album most people don't recognize it and I guess that's better anyway....all of the songs are worth-listening to ..not only the singles that are released...I think even Bon jovi won't be able to make such an album again..this is the album that they give up stupid pop-rock (or what it is)songs....it's an album that you should listen to from the beginning to the end at one time...the only bon jovi album that I'll put it in my top ten ever list
2,NOT GOOD,"BON JOVI is still capable of filling rock arenas even nowadays, a remarkable achievment for a rock outfit. But we must remember that BON JOVI is not about rock anymore. With the passing of years, they turned more commercial than ever, filling their albuns with cheap ballads. After KEEP THE FAITH, nothing was the same. The title track THESE DAYS is the only thing worth mentioning poisitvely in this album. THis is also the first one after bassist Alec John Such left the band. ( or was fired, I don't know)"
3,Bon Jovi refusing to be Bon Jovi,"These Days is the most un-BonJovi-like album Bon Jovi have ever put out. It's like they decided to pick up some fans, and also critics who tend to dislike Bon Jovi's true sound, by compromising who they are as artists. That did not work. You cannot get a long-term recognition by doing someone else's shtick, no matter how good you seem to be doing it (the songs on this album are actually quite good - that's why I gave it 3 stars). Looks like they learnt their lesson as they have never repeated anything like this again. Also they pretty much ignore this album when they tour.If you are interested in Bon Jovi and their sound, I would recommend picking up their latest album Have a Nice Day, or their 80s work, SWW or New Jersey. These albums are representative of Bon Jovi as a band. These Days is not."
1,use Cd as a placemat,"(Sorry Amazon!!) Bon Jovi belts out rocksongs with incredibly deep,often morbid words.I guess its a good cd..for a bonjovi fan.But me?I hate him!I reckon his music is horrible,I bought this when I thought his music was great(Blleee-uuurrrrrrr!)Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.."
5,great picker upper,this album has been a life saver for me it has so many great songs whether you have lost somebody or have found a new love this album will get you throughit's a great album
3,Here and There,"Kreeft's book is effective in introducing one to the contemplation of suffering. He certainly asks many of the right questions. However, his use of dialogue feels grossly manipulative and contrived; in fact, there's really no question about the manipulative part. There are a number of instances where you can see difficult questions coming, but they are deflected rather than confronted by yet another condescending and tangential foray into Kreeft's ""cleverness.""The book is certainly worth reading. However, don't be suprised by the default evasions inherent in it. Every time a truly difficult question is posed, or rather allowed to be posed by Kreeft, it's usually answered with the portrayal of God as someone who's allegedly a loving father and how it's all going to be all right in the end. Machiavelli's Prince is a rank amateur compared to Kreeft's God."
2,Who is Matt Dusk,"While this CD is well-done technically, both in terms of the music and singing, there is a haunting hollowness to Dusk's singing. Through simply attempting to emulate Sinatra, he rarely finds his own voice and his own feelings, hence the hollowness. In the creative arts, strict imititation (as we have it here) is not a form of flattery, but simply reflects a lack of a creative self... This is more about music industry marketing than the music, which is truly sad. My advice: Digg out some real Frank Sinatra or Ray Charles or explore some authentic modern singer-songwriter artists (e.g., Ben Foulds, Bruck Cockburn, Elliot Smith). Cheers!"
1,There's no life in this cd.,"I gave this cd many chances. I really wanted to like this cd. I'm a fan of Harry Connick Jr., Jamie Cullum, Peter Cincotti and Michael Buble. From what I understood, Matt Dusk was cut from the same cloth.Wrong.Matt has a good voice. It's pleasant enough to listen to (think Frank Sinatra meets Steve Lawrence), but it sounds like he's holding back any energy he may have. He's much too subdued. He comes across as spiritless.I know the cd credits say there's real live people playing on this, but it does'nt sound like it. The arrangements and performances by the musicians are not bad per say, just.....bland. The whole cd just sort of plods along. All the songs have about the same tempo. It NEVER swings.The words drab, flat, tame and uninspired all come to mind.Matt needs to breathe some life into his next recording."
1,Stop Copying Frank Sinatra. Stop the cheese!,"I love to hear old standards and such. But I like to hear people who put their own take on it. I can't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some Frank Sinatra wannabe. Where are the male versions of Nora Jones? Tone down the cheese! We need more people like sophisticated Shirley Horn and Betty Carter(NOT hams like Buble, Dusk, or boring singers like Diana Krall. But what can I expect from the music industry? Rarely do the best song-stylists get lots of attention. So, hmmm, nevermind. I guess it's always been that way."
3,"Hitler, A Study In Tyranny",I really don't know how to rate this book since I am currently rereading the unabridged version which I was forced to obtain from Amazon.com.uk. It is an excellent work and I can not imagine why Americans are not permitted to order it from the US. Does Amazon US think Americans are too lazy to read the original? I would give it 5 stars if it were the unabridged version. I will never know what the abridged said or left out.
2,A seat that doesn't stay in place !,"Not too impressed with this seat, it shifts around and doesn't stay centered on the toilet."
1,"Waste of money, another gimick.",I did not notice anything special/any effects after taking this supplement. It seems like another waste of money. I need to stop believing the hype.
3,Works too well,"So I started taking it (1 pill/day for two days) and it started to work too fast. I became dizzy, nauseated and real dehydrated. I know that for anybody first time taking it, don't use the directions on the bottle. Start with small increments until you get the desired amount right for your body."
2,Bad shoes,"I bought these shoes for my boyfriend for basketball. Ever since he's used them, he has had problems with his ancle and the bottoms of his feet. Not to mention he only had them a couple months and they started to fall apart. I dont recommend any of the Iverson's!"
5,Growing Minds,"This was a book my son needed for school. Not only was the delivery quick, but the book was in very good shape and very reasonably priced."
1,THE OTHER REVIEWS TELL ME NOTHING,"With so many releases of The Lost World 1925 available, what makes this one the one I should buy? Does it have a better picture than the restored version? Does it have a better soundtrack than any of the other versions? Because if there is one thing this movie suffers from it's a lousy soundtrack. I've heard six different soundtracks, and they're all terrible. Does it have bonus features not found elsewhere? Tell me, why should I drop up to 15 dollars on a cheap dvd-r when professional dvds are available at a lower cost. You see, after taking a bath with a2zcds ""remastered"" ripoff I am very cautious about what I buy. So once again I ask, WHY SHOULD I BUY THIS EDITION?"
3,Good but...,The first half of this book is not very good. Strangely it gets really good in the 2nd half. An ok read.
4,Nice 60's collection,"This CD contains a nice collection of France Galle's songs of the 60's. I chose it because it has some of my favorite oldies including ""Laisse tomber les filles"", ""N'ecoute pas les idoles"", and ""Nous ne sommes pas des anges"". But with 23 songs on one CD, it is apt to include some so-so songs, too. I enjoy France Galle's uniquely girlish delicate voice and her happy youthful style that is quite melodious."
4,"So lightweight, it's like not wearing shoes at all!","I was looking for some cute silver casual shoes to go with the silver purse I carry, since spring is coming. The shoes are adorable and super comfortable. I got a great price at Amazon, so I couldn't be happier!"
4,Exceptional thriller,"A husband and wife (Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan) suffer car trouble while driving through the deserts of the Southwest. When the wife disappears mysteriously, it is up to Russell to find and rescue her. The frightening plausibility of this scenario is often undercut by the more conventional action movie elements that creep in, but it remains a nail-biting thrill ride that kept me on the edge of my seat right up until the end. Talented character actors J.T. Walsh, M.C. Gainey, and Jack Noseworthy demonstrate that, when it comes to fear-inducing film antagonists, ghosts, monsters and aliens have nothing on a band of mean-spirited, sociopathic rednecks with sleazy motives./"
4,Classic Kurt Russell!,"This is one of the most exciting thrillers I saw in the 90's. Kurt Russell's performance is great! The cinematography and direction are excellent.The movie works because it doesn't try to be TOO serious. This is a Hollywood thriller, so the action certainly gets extravagant at points. The premise of the film is a fantastic setup.I love films like this where the editing is paced, rather than sporadic and choppy. For instance, the scene with Kurt Russell climbing on the outside of the semi is shot masterfully. The tension is real. The supporting roles played by Kathleen Quinlan and J.T. Walsh are convincing.This movie, considering the low price it's at these days, must be owned. It's one of Kurt Russell's best films."
4,Breathtaking action!,"The plot looks like ""The Vanishing"", with Kiefer Sutherland and Nancy Travis. However ""Breakdown"" goes to the adventure kind of film, instead of mystery. And this is its great quality. It is a surprising non-stop action movie. We kind konw what is going to happen, but it comes with a lotta unexpected electicity. Kurt Russell is well but just imagine if it was Harrison ford in his place - uau! Kathleen Quinlan has the ideal look for the desirable young wife, but she's not only the screaming victim - wait for the grand finale and you'll see what I mean!"
4,Excellent Resource!,"Fraser has done a thoughtful job of researching and writing this excellent text on the history of religion and education in America. The whole ""church and state"" debate is not all the media cracks it up to be, and here Fraser looks simply at the historical facts: a great read for any educator, home-schooler or anyone interested in ""church and state"" issues in our nation's history."
3,Please proof read!,"I live in Carrabelle/Franklin County, Florida where this book is centered. It's a quiet little fishing community and I found the book to be accurate about the locale. The plot was good and was obviously going somewhere....but.....I could barely get past ALL the typos and grammar goofs. Obviously the same person who DOESN'T spellcheck or proofread the ""Apalachicola/Carrabelle Times"" DIDN'T spellcheck or proofread this copy either.I hope his new book that's out now and advertised so much in our ""Times"" will be proofread. It's an insult to the reader's intelligence and to the author as a legitimate writer."
1,Exact re-issue of older set at a higher price!,"Warner changed the box art, but the thick ""keep cases"" inside are the exact same as the earlier release, which Amazon sells cheaper. (These are not slim cases or digipacks as reported by others.)The Bette Davis Collection (The Star / Mr. Skeffington / Dark Victory / Now, Voyager / The Letter)So save your money and buy the same for less!"
2,small print,"Unlike the description on the web site, this book came in a smaller size as a thick paperback novel, fine print. Very strange and uncomfortable to read.Covers a good amount of details of Sun LDAP JDK, but little on JNDI. I think it's starting to show its age now."
2,Absolutely Wrong Title!!!,"In my opinion the title is misleading! This book is about the proprietary Netscape SDK. And probably this is a great book about... Netscape LDAP SDK. If you wish to use JNDI instead of Netscape SDK, then the book is almost useless. It's amazing that the book contains maybe one reference about JNDI."
5,Bon Jovi - New Jersey,I bought this to start a friend's Bon Jovi collection. Trying to convert another person into a Bon Jovi fan. It might just work.
4,Simple Review,"Highlights: Born to Be My Baby, Stick to Your Guns, I'll Be There for You, 99 in the Shade. Lowlights: Homebound Train. A lot of good songs."
5,A terrific followup to Slippery When Wet.,"After the awesome success of Slippery When Wet, the band had to be intimidated by thought of following that album up. But if they were, they don't show it as this album blisters. These guys aren't your let your hair grow to your ass musicians who can't really play and just got where they were because of the way they looked. These guys can play. Bad Medicine, Lay Your Hands On Me, & Living In Sin are killer tunes and Richie Sambora is underated as a guitarists. They right terrific lyrics and add fantastic instrument playing to make truly awesome and unforgettable songs. No Bon JOvi collection should be without this one."
3,Hitcooper.com Review,"Ok, so all the critics ripped apart this CD... they don't know what they're talking about... it's just as good as the first... it's just not a novelty any longer... I did notice that Hitcooper.com just chose her as their artist pick for May... that proves that some people out there have some clue into music... i would definitely recommend the CD if you want something that is chill and has some definite artistic/musical value..."
3,"Yeah it's ""nice"" so what","Maybe it's been too overhyped and maybe the expectations were sooo high that they'd never be reached. Nonetheless, it's a decent album. It's what I would call ""nice"".It's stuff you could put on in the background, stuff you could put on and take a nap to, stuff you could play for your mother, stuff your girlfriend might even like.That said, it's not really that much different than the first one, which again was just ""nice"". Her voice is still smooth as can be; it soothes me to sleep at times. The songs just aren't all that memorable; I've been through it a couple times and can't recall any absolute-must-listen-to-standouts.So buy it, hopefully cheap, because, yes, it is nice. Just don't expect to hear the reinvention of music on this cd."
1,iS THIS A JOKE~,"PLEASE TELL ME THIS ALBUM IS A JOKE. MUSIC IS BORING AS HELL. HER SINGING IS BORING AS HELL. THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS BORING AS HELL. CANNOT BELIEVE SHE WON SO MANY GRAMMYS. I'D RATHER LISTEN TO ALICIA KEYS AT LEAST SHE'S CREATIVE AND TRIES SOMETHING...THIS CD CONTAINS THE SAME SONG, STYLE, AGAIN AND AGAIN.COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY"
2,SNORE!!!!!!,Wake me when it's over. Great voice but so what. Cutsy pablum with a country twist. How refreshing.TIP: Nellie Mckay debut kicks this to pieces!
2,does she know she's half east indian?,"the minute I looked at this girl I knew she was a desi chick, so how come she didn't admit to being related to ravi until her mom publicized it? And how come she chooses to stay away from bollywood, the biggest entertainment market out there, or acknowledge the brown fans who bought her records? She's nothing but a sellout to our community"
2,just ok,Norah Jones has Talent but this Project feels like the Label Heads said lets cash in&she also is having the Job of trying to top Herself out from how large Her Debut was. she has to have room to Grow&this set more or less is a formula Follow-Up as to Being something different.cool idea with working with Dolly Parton.but like Much Alicia Key's follow up it seems like striking on the Same Shirt&just using the same iron&Board on the Same spot.
4,Relaxing(some people need it),"I enjoy this CD. I can also understand how someone could turn away from it fast. I am a Marine and it is not too popular with most of the guys in the barracks. With that said, her jazzy/country voice is one that can really relax me. I believe that this young lady has a bright future ahead of her. This album is just a start. When she experiences a little more life, the songs will improve."
1,Terrible Music,"It's hard to tell where to begin. Norah has a beautiful voice and can sing country music. The music I heard was not country it was just bad. The song's lyrics were beyond bad. The arrangements were more than jazz inspired(they were jazz). If you are going to sing country, sing country songs with country arrangements. It's all rather simple."
4,home indeed,"I don't get it -- this CD is better than her first, yet the reviews are lackluster and she'll no doubt leave the next Grammy awards empty-handed. If you want to rock 'n roll, put the Nirvana CD in. But if you want to chill out and bask in something warm and thoughtful, ""Feels Like Home"" is a must. Buy it."
4,I used to disliked her...until I got her album!,"I used to judge her too much 'cause I didn't understand why this very new artists got so many Grammy's and a ton of platinum album sales...it just didn't make since. So I judged her and thought her music was stupid...that is until I picked up her new CD. I like the single ""Sunrise"" and I realized that her music style is the kind that I somewhat like. It's really peaceful and soothing. It's something you can sleep to and wind down to. It's just hard to know when a song ends and starts again 'cause most of the songs sound alike."
2,No Rah for this Jones,"Dull, lackluster, and lifeless. The picture in this CD's packaging material says it all: There is wan, little Norah looking sad at the back of the room, while in the foreground nameless musicians dominate the scene. I hope she gets to be front-and-center again soon."
3,"Good music, lazy recording effort","Compared to her first CD, it is obvious the producers and sound recording techs did a poor job. You can hear the microphone stand vibrate in the last two tracks, and most tracks the microphone Norah uses distorts. The post-mix production is average and doesn't make use of good stereo effects. Again, I'm comparing back to back with her first album which is reference audiophile quality.However, I do like the music and it will make a good casual CD to listen to."
4,Almost as good...,and it does grow on you after multiple listenings. The biggest disappointment was the duet with Dolly Parton. I didn't need to hear the voice of Dolly Parton on a Norah Jones CD; that's just not the style of music I was looking for in this CD purchase. I think I will burn a copy of the CD with just that song removed to make it a more enjoyable and consistent listening experience.
1,Very upset!,"First off what is wrong with Norah for putting that spyware thing on the CD it messed up my computer grrrrrrrrand second I was exspecting something like ""Come Away With Me"" and Im very upset that it dident exceed with me this CD I allready put it up for sale on Ebay...I suggest you dont get this trust me its not worth the money!"
3,Flat?,"I think Norah Jones has enormous talent and I look forward to her future endeavors. On this CD, however, while I find the quality of her voice to be enthralling, she seems to have trouble staying in tune. She just sounds flat. I was impressed with her art but disappointed in her singing."
4,Already lovin' it,"I just got the CD on Tuesday night 2/10 and it's only Thursday night 2/12 but after listening to it for a couple days, I am lovin' this CD. It can really make you feel peaceful. It took me a while to get used to it but now that I have, I think this'll be one of my favorite CD's of 2004. There is a broader range of songs where we really get to see Norah at her best. ""Come Away With Me"" was awesome and I love that CD,. This one is definitely a more mature sounding Norah and like she says, it's a snapshot of her life and that's what I love about her music. There is no fakeness, even when there is no beat, her voice is just lovely to listen to. My favorite songs are ""Sunrise"", ""What Am I to You"", ""Humble Me"", ""The Prettiest Thing""....oh heck I like them all. I strongly reccommend this CD for any Norah fan and of course, people who haven't yet converted to her music. It's such a great album. Just give it a chance. :)"
3,"Enjoyable music, but very questionable software installed","I bought the CD retail and brought it home, inserting it in my PC to play while I worked on the Mac.Imagine my shock and anger when I discovered that by listening to this CD on my PC using Windows Media Player I had unwittingly installed Bandlink software on my hard-drive that was now collecting and attempting to communicate information on my music listening practices to Bandlink and other commercial entities via my internet connection.I think that kind of software's called Spyware, isn't it?When I e-mailed Bandlink to get the uninstall tool [it isn't provided with the Norah's CD that installed it], they tried to convince me that allowing them to collect information on what I listen to was in my own interest. How George Orwell is that?While Norah Jones continues to create and record enjoyable music apparently with great artistic integrity, both she and Bluenote should be ashamed of themselves for associating themselves with Spyware."
2,A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"Had Ms. Jones not recorded. ""Come Away With Me"" this album would rate four stars. Unlike her previous recording, this latest effort lacks the poetry, lounge-jazz, hypnotic, startingly beautiful lyrics, soft country,and slow tempo that made ""Come Away With Me"" the all-time winner for recordings you DONT play in your car.I listened to this recording once and it was very annoying. The lyrics were annoying; the tempo was too upbeat; there was not a sense of the emotive or evocative; every song sounded just like the other. If you must listen, this is the CD for the CAR; her previous one is for rainy nights in the woods, resting languidly on your sofa, Ms. Jones'lyrics quietly guiding you down the tributaries of sleep."
2,A step back for her,This is pretty ordinary girl singer stuff. I think the answer is she has a very beautiful voice but it needs great music to rise above the other ordinarily beautiful voices. The music itself is very pedestrian
3,Feel Like Sleeping,"Come Away With Me was nice, mostly because other people wrote Norah songs for her. But on this cd, the songwriting is not up to the same quality (she and her boyfriend are doing most of the writing). Plus, I was expecting her to show more muscle vocally (to prove her doubters that she can sing) and she totally didn't. The only difference between this cd and her last one is on this cd; she has become less of a jazz singer and more country. I am disappointed in this cd, but I can't blast this cd. It still ranks high and above a lot of crap that's on the radio today. I just hope that Norah realizes that she has to show more growth and connect with her emotions if she wants to continue as an artist like this. She is a very nice person, humble and down to earth. But she lost me on this one."
2,A Norah Jones Fan,"Norah Jones sings wonderfully in her new CD however, the songs all seem musically sparse compared to her last CD. There are some good songs on this CD but overall I think it lacks the soul and intensity found in ""Come Away With Me."" If you like Norah Jones I would recomend buying this CD but don't expect any revalations. If you are new to Norah Jones I would suggest starting with ""Come Away With Me""."
3,somethin' missing at home,"Well, after selling millions copies of 1st album, she did brought something special and blew the worries off a thousand miles. But, it does not really clearly defining her musical journey to be fruitful and seems missing somethin'. After listening the album several times, it only grew stronger that the begining and the end is not strong enough to break my imagination and only limiting her self-portrait with numerous instruments' sounds which are not fully aligned and not even interplay in some place. I guess too many straight monologues can be too plain. It is a good album among the many, but not satisfying at this moment."
2,BATTLE OF THE JAZZ DIVAS,"Norah vs. Dena. They both sing, play piano, compose, arrange so what is the difference? Norah is BORING. and Dena is EXCITING. I stacked my CD player on one side with Norah's's latest Cd's and the other side with DENA'S AND HAD MY OWN JAZZ IDOL COMPETITION. AND THE WINNER IS DENA DEROSE HANDS DOWN. Compare song samples here, and you decide if I was right. I ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE YOU WON'T BE BORED WITH DENA. I have played Dena's albums 3 hrs. straight and was never bored. Can you say that about Norah's?"
2,The Nora Jones Southern Strategy CD,"I loved Nora's last CD with it's warm, piano jazz flavor. This CD has a few similar songs, but mainly sounds like Nora's record company selected her songs by focus group: ""Let's see, in the last CD, the South didn't buy enough Nora Jones CD's, so let's add some steel guitar, and an Opry star to some songs. That should even out our sales."" Let's face it, Dolly Parton goes as well with Nora Jones as Alice Cooper goes with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Maybe Ms. Jones will take a more active role in her song selection next time. I'd like to see her research some of the jazz classics and New Orlean's standards and I hope she finds her voice and her style without relying on a NASCAR pastiche to please everbody."
1,"Oh no, not again....","I think maybe Ms. Jones needs some help -- with her voice -- maybe voice lessons? With her musical style -- has she heard about vocal range at all? With her choice of recordings -- her first cd was mediocre -- this one is just awful....I noticed there were an awful lot of ""1"" stars -- I've never seen so many being ""awarded"" a Grammy winning vocal artist -- what are we missing? There are so many beautiful voices and talented singers out there --- I wonder if Norah's popularity will continue...."
5,great sophomore cd,please ignore and disregard the mean one star reviews foe this excellent sophomore album from the grandaughter of the great indian sitar maestro ravi shankar and it gives me great pride as an indian to listen to her great albums and her accompilshments.very highly recommended.go norah go!!!!!!!
4,Just me,"Miss jones voice is very smoothing and with a bit of little soul,enjoy listen and singing with. Painting a beauty of art as well,piano and backgroung sound effects expresses pictures of delight,as well, thankyou kindly for sharing"
3,Don't Fix What Ain't Broke,"If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then what's to say when you carbon copy yourself? When your voice is as astonishingly clear and silky as Jones's, you say congratulations. Don't fix what ain't broke...and 'Feels Like Home' is a comforting, familiar sophomore effort by a young artist still honing her indelible craft while not pandering to a new audience or defiling her core fan base. Arif Mardin produces again [actually, co-producing w/Norah], Jesse Harris back strumming his acoustic guitar on a few tracks, her Handsome Band backing up quietly and seductively, Dolly Parton and Levon Helm lending support, covering Tom Waits splendidly, and with her ravishing voice and heavenly Yamaha, establishing herself as never-really-a-jazz-singer, but a supreme force of nature. My grade: B+"
2,Blah,"Its amazing how mediocre material performed using mediocre arrangements can make a great talent sound... well, mediocre. Wait for her third album and hope it has the inspiration evident in the first."
2,"if you're not a fan of country, don't buy this CD","I absolutely loved her first CD but am really disappointed with this one. Many of the songs sound like country music, which I just despise. It hurts my ears to hear the scratchy voice of Dolly Parton singing with such a talented young artist. I hope Nora's turn toward country is just a passing whim and she will return to her previous self soon. One song I do like is the last one, ""Don't Miss You at All"", which is devoid of that hillbilly twang."
1,first heaven second hell,"what a disapointment so much from""come away with me""to absolute boring drivel. this cd as far as i am concerned does not get even one star rating"
3,Feels Like Home,"Only three stars because this recording has too many different music styles. Some nice and sultry, some country, some hillbilly, some jazz.Several songs don't fit her voice well. If you're looking for some Nora Jones consistency, this isn't it."
4,Whaddayawant for 4 bucks?,"It amazes me how other reviewers have blasted this cute little bell as if they thought they were buying a highly precise navigational instrument for a mere 4 bucks. It's a simple ""one ping"" bell with a novelty compass attached and nothing more. For me, it does just what I expect it to do, a few pings and I have warned others of my approach. The sound is friendly and well recieved. As for the compass, I have found it to be generally accurate particularly while riding on smooth surfaces where the needle has had a chance to settle.It is often said ""you get what you pay for"" and I am very happy with my $4 investment. If you need more, then be prepared to spend more!"
1,Don't waste ur money,This charger is very costly. Buy the sony or the sanyo on with the better mAH. Better to avoid canon one.
1,Awful Service,"Item has never been delivered (although Amazon's webseite indicates the contrary), seller has not responded to my complaint and I had to request the use of the guarantee (I am still awaiting response about it)."
1,Charger failed after 10 months of light use,"Bought this back in June of 2004 (price was slightly lower than now). The case is fine, but would have preferred a belt clip rather than loop. The batteries appear to be fairly good quality (unlike the junk set of 2100mAhs I bought from Radio Shark which couldn't hold a charge in a lightning storm).The charger is decent, barring a couple weaknesses: the batteries don't seat securely in the bay, so I always worry that they'll pop out (partially) during charging; the flip-out prongs on the back tend to flip-in while you're trying to insert the charger in the outlet; and, just last week, I plugged it in overnight to charge the Canon batteries, and woke up the next day with the charger still blinking away, apparently having blown one of it's ""intelligent circuits.""Well, now I'm off to buy a replacement (Sony BCG-34HD4). Wish me luck...."
4,Does exactly what I want it to.,"I needed this to split a fax machine and a credit card line apart. Seemed to be a decent choice when looking for one. Once I got it, it worked perfectly for that."
3,Good for cord end. Not good for wall. Variable quality.,"This is OK for the end of a cord, but is susceptible to damage when plugged into a wall connection. Cord jerking, bumps, etc can damage it and/or the wall connection. One of mine was loose in the connection, and another had an early latch failure. A couple of others are still working."
2,Does not work for internet,"I am not sure how well it does to hook up multiple phones or a fax, but it is to small to plug in internet cables."
2,10 cent phone device for $4,These things used be all over in phone boxes. Now when you need one you go to radio shack and they want $ 10. It's unbelievable ! This thing did the job but it's worth 10 cents.
4,Not the best horror punk but enjoyable.,"This album is good, albiet short. The only complaint I have is Chud's vocals...I'm sorry but The good Doctor belongs where he has been most of his career...behind a drum set. His vocals are ok, but not as good as Mike Graves, or Danzigs...When he hits high notes I swear his voice is off key. The punk chords are typical of course but enjoyable...overrall a good horror punk cd with cheesy lrics..oh well....buy it if you have an open mind and a love for scary punk."
5,great product,"this classic thunder chicken was really a good buy, for the price, it was worth it, I received a grey-blue model, it held together perfectly, and it was perfect down to the last detail"
1,"Oh, for the hopeless fools","News flash for all the wonderful darlings that are saying this isn't a bootleg, it is. THERE IS NO OFFICIALLY RELEASED DVDs THAT ARE REGIONLESS!!! Don't say just 'cause it's on Amazon it must be okay (people used to say the same thing about eBay) I have seen plenty of bootlegs on both (look up Ronin Warriors, the boxsets of the whole series are bootlegs) Or the other reason I saw right off the bat ""it's just in Japanese, that doesn't make it a bootleg"", no dub-track available, subtitles probably including chinese, yep, it's a HongKong bootleg, guarrenteed. I'm just amazed someone was dumb and/or crazy enough to actually list it as what it is, an illegal copy of copyrighted material."
2,Not worth it,"This same product was listed on amazon about a year ago and I bought since I love bleach. This IS a bootleg people. For those of you who don't think so aside from the other reviews that give so many reasons, heres one for you. I speak japanese and the subtitles...they don't fit. This is a translation problem found in all the bootlegs from Honk Kong and mainland China. Had a similar problem with Saiunkoku Monogatarai and Ouran Hish School Host Club. All purchased here, all bootleg. Also, the names.... why in the world would the studio release the DVDs with incorrect names of characters? Save your money. Even if you don't speak Japanese, you are still going to get irritated trying to peice together the broken verbage."
3,Umm pretty sure it is a bootleg,"I'm pretty sure this is a bootleg, almost all of the Anime DVDs Japan makes are region two. And half of those don't have English subtitles let alone English subtitles and NO JAPANESE SUBTITLES. Who would do that? And if you're saying you think this can't possibly be bootleg because it's being sold on Amazon. Amazon does let users sell their stuff you know, and it is stated Bootleg in the title so that Amazon isn't responsible for it."
1,Outdated and Nothing New,"I need someone to enlighten me why other reviews gave this book such high ratings. This book has several shortcomings. It was first written in 1986 so many things are outdated. As another reviewer has pointed out, this book needs to provide examples to illustrate its points. The writers might be good traders but are lousy writers; they have failed to explain many key points. The content adds no new information than what most people already know: low volume on rallies, drawing trendlines, breaks of trendlines as signals for change in direction. I gave up reading the first author (Hutson) half-way through. I jumped to the third author (Weis) because the chapter titles seem hopeful, but I found the same shortcomings there (not enough examples, lack of explanation, etc.). My conclusion is don't even bother with book. I gave it one star because I don't know how to rate it as zero star."
2,low charge,doesnt hold a charge for nearly as long as the battery that came with the camera. It shows 'dead battery' after every time i use it.
3,Very pleased,I have not been able to use my digital camera for over a year because all of the batteries I purchased would not hold a charge or work. I contacted Olympus and they told me to only use an Olympus replacement battery. I didn't want to spend over $40 when the camera only cost me $140. So having this option to purchase for less and it actually works - I am very pleased. I also appreciate the fast shipment. Thank you.
3,Not Original Product,"Although battery appears to be same as original product, it is not. Battery was made in Japan and assembled in Viet Nam. When comparing to original battery, most items imprinted are way different. What disturbs me most is the fact that there appears to be a year and month date imprinted on the battery ""2009-12"". Now I do not know if this is the date manufactured or expiration date but the year I purchased it was 2011. Since I have been sick (under the weather) recently I have not had a chance to use the camera with this battery much lately. Consequently, I cannot really attest to life of the battery."
1,Poor,"I purchased this product as a back up battery for my camera and when it arrived I put it in the new charger. The charger light came on and went off to indicate battery was fully charged. I placed the battery in my camera and the camera would not even turn on. I thought perhaps the camera had problems, so I charged up the old battery and when charged and placed in the camera it started up immediately. This product did not charge and was faulty. I would not recommend this product."
5,Love it!,"I love my Olympus camera but I don't like that the battery is so hard to come by. I was very excited to find it on Amazon, and at such a great price too! Not only am I happy now that my camera is working again, but I'm so glad I saved some money and got my battery so quickly too! I'm very satisfied with my purchase and I'll definitely be shopping again!"
3,Half Bad & Half Good,We bought two of these batteries for our digital camera. The problem is that one battery was completely dead. The other battery was perfect. So that is why I gave it 3 stars. The seller should made sure both batteries were working before selling them.I didn't bother exchanging it or notifying the seller because it wasn't worth the hassle. We only paid $10. for each one. But I just wanted to note that the seller needs to check their product before sending it out.Would I buy the product again? Absolutely. From this seller? Probably not.
5,Great battery,I ordered 2 batteries as spares for my camera. Both arrived in good packaging on time at a great price.Thanks
5,Replacement Battery,This battery works great and was reasonably priced. It is identical the orginal camera battery and worksin the charger.
1,Big lier,"In the picture says made in China, but is not true. Cause I bought one and they gave me one made in Japón....."
2,longer battery life,"I swapped my original battery with this one, expecting to get longer battery life. My phone kept crashing re-booting randomly, and I also discovered that my iPhone would not charge."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,These batteries were useless! They could hardly turn on the camera and if it came on it went off before I could remove one photo. I contacted the seller immediately and they gave me a refund immediately. It almost seemed like they were aware that they sold me junk.
4,"not bad. at all ..i was really surprised..and in this one, you can ACTUALLY play venom a whole Lot sooner !",I bought this game when i picked up my ds system and i have to say its quite good... in this game you can actually play venom in a level feeding on people(using the ds stylus) in central park. its fun playing venom..he shines in this version as well ...this is the way the ultimate spider man for the ps2 should have been ..i also have that one( see my review for that one) ..in that one you have to go thru the whole game to finally unlock venom ..which was mis advertised...the ds version is fun for quick super action on the go !
5,Just want to point out some problems in the book.,"The GMSK constellation diagram on Page 169 is NOT correct. Furthermore, we can not search back to the original paper listed. The reference paper does NOT have that diagram."
4,An interesting work,"Crossan's re-tooling of some of Christ's most famous utterances is welcome; it is a rare work which allows us to ""re-see"" the Gospel teachings.I would like to see more scholarship in addition to the sayings, but the absence doesn't detract much from the book as a whole."
3,Seems smaller than pictured,Even in a relatively small pickup (Ford Ranger) the size was smaller than expected. However my husband says he likes it for stowing smallish items.
5,"Made well, sturdy","Product is as shown and material made is not cheap, but i find i need bigger so I am giving to my mother."
4,way better!!!!!!,"If you love michelle williams you should already have this album. Michelle is developing well as a gospel artist. Her voice has gotten stronger. The production is great everything is great. If your looking for alot of uptempo songs you will be dissapointed ,But, i think she sounds better doing slow songs myself. Michelle keep up the good work."
3,Maybe it's me...,"I thought I was getting the first cd, but apparently not. I bought this cd last week, thinking it would be pretty good. Ever since she joined DC, I thought her voice was pretty unique (compared to Bouncy and Kelly's). Unfortunately, I fell asleep while listening to this.Like others, I expected this cd to be ""gospel,"" but it clearly wasn't. These songs are, at best, inspirational. And to make sure I was hearing them right, I read the words while listening. One person said it best: these songs could easily be about her new man or some of her friends. It left me empty.And it's kind of hard to take her seriously when you listen to ""Destiny Fulfilled."" Pretty racy there...seeing how these albums were released within a month or so of each other. I'm really interested in where her heart and her loyalty really lies. With God or with the World? The answers may lie in DC's newest videos: Soldier and Lose My BreathI'm selling this one on Ebay."
4,MARVELOUS!,"I am pleasantly surprised, blown away actually, by the quality of this album. The melody, instrumentation and lyrics that were missing on ""Heart to Yours"" are in every song on ""Do You Know"" and lend tremendous value to an improved tone of voice that I once found undesirable. ""The Incident,"" ""My Only Love Is You,"" ""15 Minutes"" (my absolute favorite)"" and ""The Way of Love"" are the reason behind me adding ""Do You Know"" to my small list of favorite inspirational albums. Michelle has left ""Heart to Yours"" in the dust and taken 5 or 6 giant steps forward as a Gospel artist. :)"
3,Not for the faint-hearted,"""Closure"" is an intense story of how a violent crime affects both the victims and perpetrators. After the crime, the victims accidently learn the name and whereabouts of one of their attackers and then devise a plan of revenge in order to regain their self-respect and to try to regain control over their own lives. The introduction into the story of the daughter of one of the attackers brings tension between the victims and alters the plans of one of them. The film ends suddenly and dramatically. Dont blink!This is a moderately interesting film depicting peoples' responses to a violent event. Because of the violence, it is definitely not for the faint of heart."
2,A very cold dish,"This movie is an unconvincing descent into gratuitous violence redeemed only by an excellent performance from Gillian Anderson. Although the desire for revenge is an understandable response to the brutality suffered by the two main characters their reaction is not a credible one. Few people act on an urge for vengeance but even if we accept that they do on this occasion it's hard to believe they would be this extreme. What is this movie trying to tell us about a lust for violence? Well, nothing really, except that some people have such a lust. Now, I like a good gory horror flick, but in such films the violence is not posited as real. Here, however, we're supposed to accept these sadistic acts of retaliation as plausible, and we're left feeling a little grubby for having witnessed them."
5,Great Snorkel!,This is a great snorkel. Seals well against your face and the water really does stay out if a wave comes by. The purge valve on bottom works well.
3,Paper feed problems,"I bought one of these printers for my mother. It works fine most of the time, but once in a while it produces a nasty paper jam. The last time I had to remove the cover (which required removing four screws) and using a screwdriver to rotate the wheel that moves the paper through. Big pain. But it's far more economical than the color inkjet it replaced."
2,Beware of toner costs,"In interests of full disclosure, I chose not to buy this printer due to toner costs. Just check those costs before you buy. A 3000 page toner costs $70, versus $54 for the toner of an equivalent Brother (say the HL1440 which I have owned) or $70 for a 6000 page Brother toner. I think Samsung is known to do this ""make the profit in the refills"" for this printer."
1,A big disappointment....,"Purchased this printer in Sept. after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately, I cannot support all the raves. I have had nothing but problems since I purchased this printer (a great price after rebate)from Amazon. After it prints three or four pages, something happens where a window comes up and says, it is out of paper when the paper storage is completely full. This happens several times a day and I think that it is overheating or something similar since I shut if off for five minutes, and I can then print another four copies. I tried several times to get Samsung Tech Service and I get a recorded message that Samsung is experiencing difficulties and to call back. They're not the only ones having difficulties. I've decided to get another reliable Canon which I have on my other PC, which I have had for a couple of years without problems and just chalk the Samsung up as a ""loser""."
2,80% fluff for Visual C++ programmers,"Book deals with one single ActiveX control, with no UI, and a simplistic purpose. Yet the author spends 80% of the book explaining the *business logic* (not the ActiveX-specific issues) of this silly example. (and the code listings of every iteration) Good beginning, good chapter on VBX to OCX (if you need that), but overall dissapointing. Hardly ""inside-out"" coverage to a proficient VC++ developer."
2,Beginning ActiveX Programmers BEWARE!,"First this book names all of the features of ActiveX but never gives enough detail for the reader to fully understand. Then it hides the nuts and bolts by using MS Control Wizards. If a control ever breaks and Microsoft's Wizards can't fix it for you, you have a snowballs chance in hell of finding anything useful in this book."
1,Makes Activex look like a 'house of cards',"After reading the cover endorsement by Microsft VP Victor Stone, my excitement soon dimmed when I studied Adam's writings. No clear picture of a recognizable architecture emerged.The book presents examples in C++ source code complete with at least two instances of potential memory leaks, while at the same time asserting this code's thread-safety! According to the bibliography Adam now works primarily with Java: at least no more memory leaks there.After reading this book I believe I now may have a much better understanding of why Microsoft may have internal problems with their ActiveX technology groups and possibly why so many of Microsoft's own COM-based applications tend to blow up so dramatically and so frequently."
3,Wait a minute! It's not that bad ...,"Chapter 3 of this book is the most frustrating part. In this chapter, the author wants to showcase so much stuff he hasn't yet explained, which makes it extremely difficult to understand. However, from the second section of chapter 4 it begins to make sense. Part II: the basics of ActiveX controls is actually pretty good, the style and approach are more or less similar to what you can find in ""Inside VC++"". If you have the patience to follow the examples in Part II, you may get some understanding of the basics and some practice as well. My suggestion is: read ""Inside COM"" first, then skip the first three chapters of this book. After you're done with part II, you should be able to write ActiveX controls (is that too much to ask for anyway?)."
3,Sound - good; construction - not so much,"This hands-free earbud for cordless phones works great. It's much easier for me to hear when I'm using it than when I place the phone directly to my ear. Plus, I love being able to move around and do things with my hands free instead of holding the phone to my ear. However, there are two drawbacks. First, the piece that fits into your ear doesn't seem to be shaped like a human ear, unless your ear canal is round, so it feels like it's going to pop out; but it doesn't. (I've found other earpieces are the same. Who's designing these things?) Second, as someone else noted, there's a little plastic silver piece that is part of this headset and it really is the weak link. I have had two of these just snap in half. I'm currently using my third headset, and I'm online now to order more, which tells you something. I like it, for the most part, but really wish it was made of better material. If the price wasn't so reasonable, I would look for something else."
5,Excellent Service,Seller was very professional and considerate!! Shipped immediately without any hastle. Very responsive to e-mails and questions. I highly recommend this seller with no hesitation! Outstanding Service!
1,"Ditto. Horrible quality, unsafe, poor design.","Even if the rest of the negative reviews were wrong (which they are not, but I won't bore you with a repeat of the same complaints), the seats are very far away from the table, making it difficult for a small child to do anything (eat, draw, read, etc) on the table.When the screws backed out, seats came off, and table collapsed, we considered fixing it with new screws, holes, wood glue, etc., but really the design makes it not that great of a table and not even worth the time to do that. In my opinion, it's not even worth the 14.99 we paid. Someone paying full price would probably be livid."
1,Table broke w/in 30 days.,Sadly...you get what you pay for and this table was on sale for only $15 when we got it. Now we know why. It seemed flimsy already when we built it but it was broken w/in days by 3 tiny girls.Wouldn't recommend.
4,A great farce!,"""Don't Dress for Dinner"" is an absolutely hysterical farce written by Marc Camoletti and adapted for the British stage by Robin Hawdon. I was involved with a production of this show at our local theatre, and it was an absolute delight to watch! It's a fun read, too!"
5,Fantastic New Moves Like Crazy!,"Most of these moves are great although some of these moves I don't like, but they teach a lot in this 2.5 hour DVD, so pick and choose your heart away. It flows quite well and I'm getting a huge boost in my dance moves as a lead rather quickly! Look out follows!!! LOL If you are at least intermediate, I strongly recommend this! If you teach swing, I strongly recommend this! My only complaint is there is almost no slides shown and certainly none in the titles intentionally taught. New Volume for slides?!? LOL"
5,Delicate Floral Bath,"The delicate fragrance of the Kneipp Almond Blossom Bath is very comforting. The oil can be used in the bath, in a footbath or even just in a sink of warm water to soothe your hands. Perfect for pedicure/manicure applications and a tablespoon added to a bath creates a nurturing fragrant escape. The orange oil is energizing and you might enjoy this for steam facials. I put this in my SpaMist unit and have been enjoying the warmth of the fragrance that is somewhat reminiscent of a walk out in nature where wild honey almond flowers blossom.~The Rebecca Review"
3,"Loved the Stinky Cheese Man, not so impressed with this","I bought this because my son loved The Stinky Cheese Man, this book was not quite as engaging. The artwork was a little dull. Would not recommend."
2,"Very clever, very sinister","I agree with the reader who said it's for parents, not necessarily their children. The illustrations are astonishing and darkly humorous, but really too cynical for the very young children it is marketed for. Adults: read and enjoy. I haven't met a child yet who didn't put it down almost immediately."
4,Great little camera,"I love my camera and I love that it takes movies too...I just wish it had a stronger zoom or at least some available adapters for a stronger zoom for my bird photos! But other than that, I have enjoyed it tremendously and get great photos out of it."
4,Are those other reviewers refering to this camera???,"I purchased this camera because is is compact but has a huge view finder.My first impression is this camera is heavy for it's size even with the battery removed. It feels like it is made of cast iron.The rechargble battery is a little unusual, so don't expect to find a replacement anywhere except in a dedicated camera store.The XD memory card that comes with the camera will let you take 16 full resolution pictures, so you need to buy a spare. I recommend an H (high speed) 512 MB or 1 GB memory card.I have yet to test the durability. More on that later."
4,More than I expected,"This is a great camera for those who are not too tech savvy. I just took it on a vacation and came home with some great photos!Several people who saw me using it, inquired about the BIG screen and the camera's ease of use. Have never considered myself a salesperson, but raved about it everywhere I went!"
1,Horrible Customer Service!!!,The camera is fine as long as nothing goes wrong. Fuji has the worst customer service I have ever delt with. They pass you from one person to another and do everything they can not to help you. Be prepared to deal with the worst customer service in the business. I really hope this helps you.
4,Sexy Camera,"Good quality-value-price. Pictures not always great out of sunlight. Looks great, convenient, would get it again"
4,Fuji Finepix V.10,"AWESOME CAMERA! Just what I wanted. The thing I wanted MOST is a FAST, FAST camera. This is it, this camera takes super fast pictures of my little girl in action. She is usually almost impossible to get a good picture of. My HP camera was so slow in comparsion. If megapixels were higher I would have given a 5 Star. In my camera I used the H-speed 1GB card, it is also super fast. Pictures upload to my computer (50 pics) in about 2 seconds! Using PICASA, Amazing! Camera body is also awesome high quality brushed steel beautiful! Great job Fuji!"
3,Fine Reading for a Start,"Anything worth doing is worth doing well...Tenzin Palmo's spiritual journey is extraordinary in that she invests all she has into it with a passion and intensity that is worth applause. However, this whole business of 'enlightened' she is after is what makes me squirm in my seat. If, as she says, enlightenment is nothing out of the ordinary then what is the great desire for it? Just be. One of the Togdens put it very well when he told Ms Palmo that there is nothing that they(the Togdens) knew that she did not, except that ""we practice it""!I am also wondering whatever happened to the madhyamika (middle) path that the Buddh (the missing 'a' at the end is not a typo but deliberate - it leads to the universal mispronunciation Buddhaa) advised? At the end I was left wondering if the austerities were indeed necessary, let alone warranted? Again, it is one person's journey, one human's endeavor and she has the right to go about it any way she wishes to...interesting read though."
1,Extremely Misleading,"This product and its pictures are EXTREMELY misleading. The picture shows a two port phone jack connected to a fairly long phone cord. The picture makes it look like it is one item. This is not the case. When my shipment arrived, it was a three port phone splitter and a long phone cord with no way to connect the two included. Since I had ordered this product specifically because it had a phone splitter attached to a long phone cord, I am very disappointed in this product and the false advertising. I would not recommend this product to anyone.For the record, the ""technical details"" is misleading also:Duplex adapter attached on one end provides connection of two devices25 Foot cord"
4,Where are the Irving Johnsons and Alan Villiers of yesteryear?,"If you have the delightfully entertaining and informative video produced by Mystic Seaport you might think this an unnecessary adjunct. But the man could write. Also you will encounter a few details you did not know about the making of this voyage. While not illustrated, the picture on the cover is very pretty."
1,Extremely basic book... NO valuable insight,"This books is a very basic introduction to factoring, which should more or less be targeted at the kids of a potential factoring entrepreneur. It gives no additional insight if your are familier with the term ""factoring"" and use your common sense. Waste of money and time."
1,How Disappointing!,This grill is extremely poorly made: cheap materials! Pieces do not fit together. This grill will not last should you decide to keep it. Returned immediately to Amazon....
3,All in Black and White,"In todays world of color, and because it is a ""picture book"", I was really disappointed to see that the whole book was in Black & White. Not one page of color! Given the price of this paperback book, and because it was not obvious from the Amazon description, I thought it was a good idea to at least let this be known. This book is OK if you want to see a photo archive of AMC cars all reproduced in a B&W; Paperback. Or, if you buy all AMX/Javelin/AMC musclecar books, then you are probably going to buy this one regardless. Bare in mind that this book does include all the pre-1967 AMC ""Performance Cars"" as well!! But, if you are into color, there are other really nice AMC books out there with lots of picture in color, and they are cheap. I was really happy with other books such as Larry Mitchell's ""AMC Muscle Cars"", and ""AMX &Javelin; Gold Portfolio"".Bottom line: Disappointing, and probably OK if you can get it at less than the current asking price."
4,can't complain!,"I ordered the green lifesaver tongue ring. When it arrived, I noticed that it's not as green as I had expected it to be, but is instead a yellow/green, but I'm not particular, so it was not an issue for me. It may be better to take out the ""life saver"" before going to bed, because, personally, my tongue swells a little when I'm sleeping, so it has occasionally caused discomfort upon waking up."
1,Never Again,We have now had two collars just like this. This first one broke in about a month so the store replaced it. Now the second one has stopped working just a few months later. I think we stopped using it for a while and it still did not last more than a couple weeks. The batteries run down in just a few days. Those type of batteries are not very cheap. I would never buy another collar from this company again.
3,Dog collar,Did not realize it had a battery in the collar as opposed to a plug in charger. Battery life is not the best.
4,"""She thinks I'm a wacko.""","I liked parts of this book but had a hard time deciding on 3 or 4 stars as I have read better.I liked Once In A Blue Moon. I thought the way it handled the sex over forty and after parenthood issues was good. I thought the humming on the way to the living room was cute. ""Cute"" is a good way to describe this story.Moon Magnetism was all right. I think Jim Butcher (The Dresden Files) does the technology issue better. The elevator scene was very hot.Moonstruck just didn't do anything for me, although I did laugh at the ex falling in the fountain. ""Would you like to see my knitting?"" - wow, who knew that knitting had replaced etchings? More of a 3 star read for me.Not a bad read, I just didn't enjoy it enough for 5 stars, and it was iffy on the 4 stars."
3,Familiarity with subject made the book a good read.,"Another in a series of Jeri Howard mysteries this one begins with the death of of a corporate legal assistant, Rob Lawter. As Jeri goes undercover to the corporate legal office where Mr. Lawter worked she finds the evidence to figure out what happened. What I was struck with was the dynamism of the departed Mr. Lawter. This dude should be the subject of a whole series of books, instead of Jeri Howard. In fact, it seemed clear that Jeri Howard considered the filing and the dictation in the legal department beneath her."
4,It's not about magic...,"The book is very good. One may feel that the book was written just to promote Mr. Bolinger's works, but actualy he talk about his work very humbly. However, the simple way Mr. Bolinger explains his ideias, the down to earth advices and the balanced way to user the Bollinger Bands make its worthing a try.This is not a book about HOW TO... it's about the concept and ""deus ex machine"" of the Bollinger Bands. The HOW TO... is by one owns risk and mind."
5,Don't be put off by the title,"This book is a collection of stories for any one interested in the fundamentalist faith -- adult child or ""maverick."" All the stories ring true. Not necessarily a ""Christian"" book, although it is about, and possibly for, a person familiar with the Protestant Christian faith."
3,"Ok, but a lightweight treatment","It is a good read for some of the why in using software patterns in the design. I liked the author's suggested process of doing more design and less coding. This seems to me to be how projects do get done on time and within budget. The attempts at humor and several badly written parts hurt the book. The summary at the end of chapter 1 is a good example. It is a complete negation of the chapter's point and is almost unreadable. This happens in a number of places. The humor appears in the wrong places, often hurting the strength of the the author's message. The book is worth reading, but not for those who are looking for more depth on the why of using patterns."
2,The Peigon has feeling too,I was very disappointed in these books. The pictures and words did not appeal to myself or my grand daughter. I will not buy anymore of this series.
5,"Books, Good Gift For Kids","Gave this to my pre-school niece who's Mom is a grade-school teacher, hoping it would please her since she loves books...I was told she loved it!"
2,Not as good as other Pigeon books :(,"Very short book. My whole family enjoys reading Mo Willems books and the Pigeon series is our favorite. However, ""The Pigeon has feelings, too!"" has been a disappointment. There is not enough content."
2,it is hard for a pigeon to really show feelings,We do like Mo Williams in our house. We had the Knuffle Bunnies books and a couple with the Pig and Elephant but this was our first pigeon book. The fact that our daughter doesn't really gravitate towards Oscar the grouch should have been an indication that she wouldn't love the pigeon either. My biggest complaint is that we have some other feelings books and you can really see the feeling job off the page. This book falls flat with that.
3,Great indie metal from da eighties 3 1/2 stars,"I bought this back in da eighties cos i loved the first two Iron Maiden lps. I was pleasantly surprised. Sounds a lot like the Maiden albums from that era by Judas Priest and Dianno's former band, Iron Maiden. I am giving it 3 1/2 stars instead of four cos some of it sounds a wee bit dated although it certainly aged better than some of the cheesy MTV manufactured hair metal bands like Europe. My favorite track back in da day was Feel The Rock."
1,Total Junk,Can not even understand my own outgoing message - sounds like talking through a blanket. Tried rerecording 25 times to no avail.
1,Not so durable,"I have bought a couple Kong items for my three Rottweilers. Anyone who has a Rottie for a furry child knows that this breed can destroy something in seconds with their strong jaws and sharp teeth. This particular Kong item was disappointing. After receiving the item, I gave it to my dogs and monitored them to see if this Kong toy held up and was tough like the other Kong toys. It didn't take long (probably 15 minutes) and my dogs had chewed pieces of the Kong off. I haven't let my dogs chew on this toy after they were able to chew off pieces in a matter of minutes.I can't say whether this dental toy cleans a dog's teeth since I won't let my dogs chew on this item anymore. The other Kong items I love and my hard chewing pups have not destroyed these toys yet. It was very disappointing that this Kong was not as durable as the other Kong items."
4,Good wholesome fun and adventure,"Harriet's observations about the world around her are insightful, and spawn great conversations with my eight year old. My daughter, however, is a bit disappointed that there are no real mysteries in this book. It is mostly, as she puts it, a book about a girl rudely paying attention to everyone else's business. The author creates a good balance though; the reader is well aware that Harriet is being inappropriate, but can still empathize with Harriet's feelings. I love that Harriet the Spy's adventures are clean fun, yet still entertaining and interesting."
3,"It's expensive, but it works","I hated seeing how much it costs to replace my AC adapter when the cord connection to the block began to fray, but I have to admit that this has stood up well so far. The reinforcement around the joint where my last adapter began to fall apart looks the same on this one, so I don't know if I'll end up with the same problem or not. I've had the new one for nearly two years, though, so I guess I can't complain."
4,The final test will be the move!,"To be fair, these are called ""China Dinnerware Storage"" cases, not moving cases, but what inspired me to buy them was a needing a way to pack up my family china for a move, looking forward to having a way to nicely store said china once the move is completed.For storage, these are lovely. Currently, my china all resides on top of my kitchen cabinets, where they get nice and funky and dusty and scratch each other up. These nice cases will keep my china dust-free and the plate separators will keep them from scratching.For moving, they aren't as awesome. I'm much more pleased with the same items from this set for glassware, as they come with sturdy cardboard bottoms and sides. I wish the dish sets came with them as well.However, with enough paper and bubble wrap, they look like they will do the job conceivably well. We'll see in a few weeks how my plates come out on the other side!"
2,Janson Beckett DermaExcel,"I always wonder about expiration dates on products. I would have to guess that this may have been discounted because it may be out of date. I'm very familiar with the product line, and this is not what I was used too. Essentially, there was zero progress or difference in my skin !!!"
1,Cheap,"The fabric and cosntruction of this costume was terrible. It only vaguely looked like the pictures and many of the accessories weren't proportional to the rest of the costume. In the picture, the belt hangs to the boy's kness. On my son, it was so short that the ends just stuck out of the knot while the rest of the costume was a little big for him. I don't know how the black mask was supposed to attache to anything. It was too small to tie around his head so we just threw it away. He wore the costume because we didn't have time to replace it but I would have if it had been an option."
2,My son likes it,"Okay, so we could go two routes here: my review, or my son's review. My 7 year-old son, who got this for Christmas 6 months ago, would say he loves it. And he does enjoy dressing up in it.My review is that:1. There are too many black fabric pieces that just get in the way and get lost (I've ended up throwing them away when I find one)2. The material isn't the best quality (the elastic in the pants have started to come out of the waistband)So, take that for what it's worth...a boy's review or a mother's review!"
1,Very Bad Stitch. Low quality costume. Disappointed when open box.,"I highly recommend not to order this. Very Low quality, first was eagerly waiting for the product, when received didn't meet exceptions.The costume was not properly stitched. complete rip off. They should not be allowed to sell their products and rip customers, I ll will email to amazon as well the ruined my kids holidays. Will find a way to get money back. the shipping was 3 times the price of the item, which i accepted this whole thing is a scam.Doesn't Amazon get a bad name for putting these kind of stores online?"
2,Low quality,The costume mateiral is of low quality. I was worried whether it would last for just one-evening use. I would not buy it again.
1,"I NEVER RECIEVE THE PRODUCT , I AM STILL WAITING","I BUY THIS ITEM I I DONT RECIEVE THE PRODUCT YET, PLEASE I WANT TO KNOW WHEN IS GOING TO ARRIVE TO MY ADDRESS, I WILL BE WAITNIG AN ANSWER."
4,good mold,"It makes smaller moon cakes as I expected. The carving is ok. Maybe because I am new on making moon cakes, I cannot get very good pattern on the surface of the moon cake. But it is a pretty good solid wood moon cake mold."
3,Not very bad,I have seen worse and even though it is a b movie the zombies were still very good. I did throw it away after watching it.
4,Good Overview of Their Later Work,"If you're looking for the big hits, look elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you want a servicable sampling of the bands post-1970 career, this will do fine. The band went through trials (literally) and tribulations duriing this time, and it shows in the stylistic inconsistencies. The band had an experiment phase, which more or less ended when ""Endless Summer"" created a huge demand for classic, sixties BB's music. They took the show on the road, and started trying to duplicate their old sound. You'll probably consider the later stuff a pale imitation of the BB's records you grew up with as a kid. Still better than most of what's out there."
4,Exciting throughout!,"Gripping storyline from the beginning to the thrilling end!Educational, but fascinating, for most of us who do not know thescience, and history, of the making of the atomic bomb.I enjoyed the riveting suspense, along with the historical facts, and character portrayal.I highly recommend!"
5,Worked perfectly,"I own a Sony 2001 SCD775 CD/SACD Player. Until recently it would play any burned CD's perfectly. During the last several months, it would refuse to recognize burned cd's at all most of the time. This problem seemed to be dirt, as burned cd's are more difficult to read than regular cd's. This Memorex CD/DVD Laser Lens cleaner worked quickly and restored my CD player to perfect working condition for burned and regular CD's. Give this CD cleaner a shot--it's definitely worth the money!"
1,Still getting error messages,"I have an insignia TV/DVD player, it is starting to get a lot of ""disk error"" messages, SO I purchased this... it couldn't even read THIS cleaning disk!Save your money"
1,Garbage,"I bought this to clean my PS2. It cannot be read by every electronic I've put it in... The PS2, dvd player, even my computer. It is not recognized as a disc at all. Don't waste your money. This is very disappointing because some of the older Memorex cleaners worked just fine."
3,Didn't work for me...,"I have a slot-loading iMac whose DVD drive stopped reading DVDs but was able to read CDs. I figured it was simply the DVD reader lens inside that had gotten dusty or dirty. Before taking my computer in to be repaired, I bought this lens cleaner to see if a few bucks spent on this thing would save the hassle of hauling my computer in. I ran the disc through the drive multiple times, heard it spin and the brushes do their thing, but no luck with my drive. I'm hesitant to leave a really bad review since my problem may have been more severe, but just beware that this product may not do what you're hoping if you're not completely sure that a dirty DVD lens is your problem!"
5,"It Works, but not for the Wii.","I bought this to try to repair the Wii, but that's another story. It works okay with other CD/DVD drives."
1,Didn't fix my problem,"Our DVD player just stopped in the middle of a disk one day, and suddenly could not detect the disk--or any disk, for that matter. Thought we'd give $10 a try before shelling out for a new player. Sadly, our player wouldn't recognize this disk either, making its cool audio and cleaning features impossible to assess on the current machine.Sounds like it's good if you're experiencing skipping, but if you're player is telling you ""Please insert disk"" when you already have, this is not the solution for you. I have to concur with the other reviewer here who came to the same conclusion, wish I would have read that before buying this cleaner.We plan to keep this cleaner, and perform some regular ""maintenance"" with our new player to avoid, or at least prolong, this bitter end."
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought this product for the purpose of cleaning the optical lens on my Samsung DVD player. When I put it in and closed the compartment, the machine rejected it completely. It said it couldn't read the disk. Thus, it didn't do what it was advertised to do. It wasn't expensive (thank goodness), but I have the same need to clean the optical lens of the DVD player I had before only now I've lost time and a small amount of money. If this product works for you, then I think that's great. And it might do that on newer models. I don't know. It did not work on my Samsung DVD player, which is about 4 years old."
1,"Didn't work, bought it again, didn't work again!","I bought this so-called lens cleaner twice from different sellers and neither time could I get any of my DVD or CD players to read the disc. I thought the first copy might have been a dud (it was an open box) so I bought another one. Boy am I stupid! My Panasonic DVD player won't read it, my Toshiba DVD player won't read it, my Philips CD player won't read it. I don't understand how a company can sell a product that simply won't work in who knows how many different brands of players!Don't waste your time and money!"
4,Great DVD Lens Cleaner!,"I bought this item to try to clean my Wii laser lens. It was just an idea on my part, and in no way based on any claim by the manufacturer. It will not work for the Wii. (Oh, Well) My purchase was not a total loss though. I used this on an old DVD player that I thought I was going to have to scrap, and it worked wonderfully! My DVD player works like new again. I highly recommend this for cleaning your DVD laser lens."
5,Fabulous,"Let me tell you, this is a real steal and a great product--I love it and shopping this way is so convenient!"
2,NOT HER BEST BOOK,"I was disappointed in this. I love Poirot, I love Christie, but this was only mediocre. I could get this type of mystery from Dorothy Gilman or someone else who mass produces mystery. Don't get it, please!"
5,Funerals can be fun!,"Agatha does it again! Without wishing to give anything away, she has the reader looking in the wrong direction from page one right up to the end. How many times have we Christie fans fooled ourselves into thinking we know ""whodunnit,"" only to find out that, dammit, she's pulled the wool over our eyes again! This one is pure pleasure; the characters are more eccentric than usual and therefore quite funny at times, and the puzzle (and its solution) is as amazing as any she ever came up with."
3,I really enjoyed it,"I found that, once again, Agatha Christie keeps us guessing wrongly till the last page. I really enjoyed reading about Hercule Poirot, he's just amazing."
2,cheap,Mine is six months old now and only played once or twice a week. The top broke off the cd player last night. The display is not lit up at all. The sound is okay for the price but it has stopped playing cd's about half way through their play. I was here looking for a new one when I saw this and thought I should review it.
1,Did they forget to put the working parts in?,"This item is the worst of the worst.At roughly $29.00 I didn't expect much, just something that would play cd's and the radio, I didn't even expect it to have good reception, just halfway decent would have been great. What I received was a cute looking portable player but I can't with all honestly call is a ""CD-R/RW Player with AM/FM Stero Radio"". Yes, it did have a button for AM and one for FM and it seemed to have a place to put a CD and yes, it did have an antenna and I did see a volume control button. But, the ""item"" does not play music, does not turn on, does not have ANY sound coming out of it whatsoever. Item arrived brand new in a factory sealed box packed very carefully by Amazon as usual - what they forgot to put in this unit was all the working parts. Those Emerson guys can be real tricky."
2,Emerson's CD Player is a Lame Product,"It has decent sound quality and the radio stations plays without a hitch but after a few months the CD player just wouldn't work. It's advisable to save your money and buy a better quality CD player than the Emerson Portable CD Player. If you're looking for a cheap quality CD player then Emerson is for you but if you want a long lasting, durable, all-purpose CD Player which puts out high quality sound look around Amazon.com for a better quality product because this CD Player isn't it."
5,Love Them,"I have read Anne Rice books! I've read all of them at least twice, Mayfair Witches4times for them. So if you want a good evenings read pick one at Amazon.com\Shirley 65 yrs old"
5,Mayfair Witch continued,Taltos is so spell binding you can't put it down. A must have. I could not put this book down until I finished it.
3,Should have stopped at Lasher,"I liked this book the least. I think that it should have ended with Lasher. Maybe I just wanted a happy ending. It was a good story and was written well I just didn't like what happened in the story at all. No, not my favorite."
1,Absolute Bomb!,"100% un-readable. Couldn't even make to page 100, much lesspast it. Has absolutely no story line with even more useless,irrelevant, & tedious information. Wasn't made to be read, was meant to be burned at the stake...(i've tried reading her other novels in hopes of some talent, but alas i found none.)"
1,Really??!!,"The format used drove me crazy. It jumped all over from past to present to future to 1 character to another and back again. I was so frustrated, I just jumped ahaed page after page until I could see what was happening to the main characters."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"The end of this story of spirits and incest, and some back story on the whole Taltos development. It turns out that there are a few of these, and one of them becomes and important character in the book.Mona finds out she is carrying Rowan's husband's child, and they decide to have it.Supernatural types end up running away togethre."
4,good anne rice,"Written just as the Mayfair Witches was written. If you liked the first book, you'll like this one."
2,Dissapointing.,"Having read and enjoyed both 'The Witching Hour' and 'Lasher' I found 'Taltos' to be mediocre, at lease compared to the first 2 books of the series. Mr. Ash's character is incomplete and he seems to be placed there just to justify the need for a 3rd sequel. This makes the whole book boring and in general ruins the great atmosphere created in the first 2 books."
3,Two great novels then this! Please...... Bored me to Death!,"Again, you can have so much ideas in your brain, apparenly this one was not it. After writing the best novel The Witching Hour, and a great sequel Lasher, and it comes to this, Taltos. A boring story, uninteresting characters, with nothing about the witches. Anne has made the mistake by focusing on Ashlar the taltos, when this is not his series, it should be the Mayfairs. I kept reading hoping for more stories on the witches but all I got was 10 lines. Please. Ashlar is interesting but to make him the focus of the novel, please, totally boring character compared to the Mayfairs. It just bored me to Death.This is one novel, that has not enough material for a movie. Yes that is right. It is no where near The Witching Hour or Lasher."
4,A good introductory French book.,"The watercolor pictures are a nice size, easy to see and to recognize. Underneath each picture is the French article (a, an, the) and word; under the French word is the English translation. The book covers over 500 words, including the basics (body, opposites, colors, animals, food) as well as daily tasks and sights (drying hair, skyscrapers, classroom items). At the back is an alphabetical listing of the French words with their pronunciations. My three-year-old enjoys this book, and we are having fun learning French together."
2,Doesn't best USB,"I wanted to sync my iPod as quickly as possible, and the documentation (printed and online) suggested that firewire would be faster than USB or USB2.0. But I've synced several times each way, and at least this PCMCIA firewire cardbus is *slower* than USB2.0.Plus, the iPod battery is recharged during a USB/USB2.0 sync, but *not* during a firewire sync. So not only does the firewire sync take longer just for the music, and not only is additional time (and a connection) required to recharge the battery, but the battery also drains *during* the firewire sync, making it a triply long process.I'm returning this, and going back to USB."
4,very like Waugh,"The dust jacket of The Light Years, the first in the Cazalet series, compares the book to the ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" television series from the BBC. And there is a certain resemblance, of course, as there would be with any upper-class English family of the early 20th century. However, Elizabeth Jane Howard's book is more like Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited or Jane Austen's Emma -- a leisurely stroll of a novel where the character development is much more important than any plot line. You'll find you really care how each of the major characters changes and grows -- whether adults or children.The Light Years also made me realize for the first time how constrained women's lives were, even as late as 1937.This is a book that will sneak up on you. If it were a movie, it would be disparaged as a ""chick flick."" However, you won't realize how much you like it until you've finished the last page and feel cheated that it's ended. I immediately ordered the next book, Marking Time."
4,different perspectives,"I really enjoyed the Cazalet Chronicles, for many reasons. Much of it came from a child's/young person's perspective which was unusual."
2,El arte de la Guerra,Es bueno para la gente de negocio y ventas ...pero para el diario vivir no le veo ni pie ni cabeza
3,confused,"I ordered this, but I didn't think I ordered the book in large print. I don't see anything on the order that says the book is in large print. This book is huge because of it. Not what I expected."
3,So-So,"I have just gotten finished with Tooth and Claw. I (being a Trekkie from way back) almost always find Star Trek books entertaining and a quick read. However, in this case I must say I was somewhat disappointed. The storyline is based on an interesting premise. However, I found character development lacking, and the story too slow to develop. I give the book 3 stars because I enjoyed Data's language experiment and as I say the storyline is good> I just found the execution lacking..."
2,Very disappointed,"From the beginning, I was very disappointed with the plot(s) which were all overthe place. The action did not follow any Bibical teachings I have come across andfinally turned it off. Won't try to watch it again."
4,One of the best comps ever...,"Alright, I bought this comp after my record collection was stolen at a CD release party i DJ'd. I had albums by, and the albums featuring, most of the artist and tracks on Disc one ""Goth Side"" and a few disc by some of the artist on the ""Industrial Side"", even once Dj'd a party that ""Razed in Black"" performed at, but alot of the songs were new to me (don't listen to alot of industrial.) Disc 3 ""Remix Side"" features some great mixes, aall of these disc read like a good playlist from your local goth/industrial night.This is probably one of the best comps I have heard and ranks up there with ""Gothic Rock"" Volumes 1 and 2. This is a much better choice if you are first getting into the scene, or giving as a gift for someone else as it covers the industrial as well."
5,Sisters of the Red Death blows BTNAN away...,"I have been very eagerly awaiting the arrival of this cd for quite some time, i preordered it directly from sony and i am glad to say it was worth the wait. All preconceived notions aside this album is simply incredible. The subject matter is something some may be offended by, as it talks about rape,murder,things that happen behind closed doors at catholic schools, and castration to name a few. But if you can overlook that you will definately be singing along with all the catchy hooks for months to come."
1,horrid,this book [stinks]! the examples are skecthy and only show one type of the problem the certain trig section is on (when there are many situations and scenarios trig problems could be in). this book makes self teaching impossible. I would suggest another book to use.*this is a student prespective
1,An intreaguing design with obvious flaws.,"Upon purchasing my new Bodum double walled drip coffee maker, I was thoroughly impressed with its ability to make coffee, keep it warm, and interest guests. After a couple weeks of careful use, I went about my daily routine. After warming up the reservoir, I poured my coffee into the warmed reservoir (via instructions as I had every time). As I was sitting at my computer, about 10 minutes after the coffee had been prepared, I was startled by a loud ""pop"" and spent the next 10 minutes picking up glass, not drinking coffee. Being that I got the item for around $20, I am not too upset, though I would be thoroughly upset had I paid retail. I would not purchase this item again. Total p.o.s. in my opinion."
1,There should be a way.......,"Sent the first one to me......arrived in shards. Sent the second one.....also in shards. Both were sent UPS, but packed box inside a box, but with only padding around inner box on one side! This is America, and there should be a way they can ship this to a customer in one piece!!!!! Instead, Amazon refunded my money, so now I have 2 filters, and NO CARAFE!"
1,Poor packaging and product design,"Unfortunately, I suffered a similar experience - the carafe was broken in shards upon arrival, though only the interior was actually broken.Judging from other user reviews and my own experience, I can only speculate that the problem lies not so much in the packaging (though it is woefully inadequate for something so delicate), but rather in the design of the product itself. Clearly the glass is too thin or brittle to survive the wear and tear of transit, let alone daily use in a kitchen."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $20, followed the instructions with two scratched DVD's from the library (one badly scratched, the other still playable) - and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability. It's going back in the morning.This model relies on an aluminum oxide paste (superfine liquid sandpaper) to sand off the scratches. I think I'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc.For cleaning, just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol - they work just fine."
1,Cleaning Mode Does Damage!,"I must agree with the other shopper who found this unit damaging his discs. In cleaning mode, the Optifix Pro leaves a hazy film on the disc, with radial swirl patterns, that I have not been able to remove. An effective cleaner should leave a disc shiny and bright, free of haze. According to Memorex, this haze is caused by the pads and solution and can be wiped off -- but I wasn't able to wipe it off. I would have to call this product UNACCEPTABLE, and I am returning it for a refund. I guess I'll have to pick up one of the Maxell cleaners; they're poorly made of cheap plastic, but at least they clean a disc effectively and feature reusable pads..."
1,Just buy a new CD!,"I've tried this on at least 20 CD/DVDs just to see if it actually repaired them. It doesn't. In fact, it added scratches to a perfectly good blank CD that I used as an experiment.If you have a damaged disc, buy another disc. Don't waste your money on this ""repair kit."""
1,Worthless,"This thing does nothing. It does not repair well nor clean well. Complete rip off of a product.UPDATE: I've found that pressing down the the lid while it is operating improves the results. Of course it will probably end up wrecking the motor and/or the CD. I still wouldn't recommend buying this thing, but if you're already stuck with one... you can give this a try if you're feeling brave."
3,Not so Bad,"I bought this unit about a year ago, maybe longer. I bought it to repair my old cds and dvds. I soon found out it did not do a repair job all that well. But I didnt really expect it too, seeing that it only cost 20 bucks. However, recently I have been converting my cd collection to mp3's on the computer and alot of my discs were really dirty. I put about 80 discs though it to be cleaned, and i can say it does that pretty well. So even though it didnt do what i really needed done, a year later i got good use out of my $20. And what other people have been saying about damaging their discs even more, I have not noticed this. I might just be lucky though."
4,it worked!,"Though other reviewers appear to have had less impressive results, I have just now used this project successfully to repair a CD that used to stop in the middle of track four and cause my computer to seize up while iTunes tried to deal with the issue.This is a very basic product. The working parts are plastic and the entire thing is very lightweight. It doesn't look very promising out of the packaging.But, hey, I'm now listening to track five.It worked for me."
1,The Scratch maker,"I bought this today to see what i thought. But it did NOTHING to repair my nonworking disc! It added scratches and hazes. In fact, id even worse harm to it..."
5,Great Product,My son had several video games that wouldn't play anymore and since using this cleaner he hasn't had any issues. Great product.
5,Plato's Timaeus by Peter Kalkavage,"Plato's Timaeus by Peter Kalkavage includes the Kalkavage translation of the Dialogue and two supporting sections, the introduction and the glossary, that are integral to the richness of the book. The Dialogue portion is beautifully translated and very readable. The introduction provides a fascinating treatise for the person wanting to understand the Timaeus as well as how Platonic dialogues generally might be approached. The glossary is not simply a list of terms and definitions, but offers an explanation of the concepts embedded in the language of the Dialogue. Peter Kalkavage's Timaeus is not just for scholars. It offers insight for all those interested in Greek philosophy, Platonic dialogues and in particular, Plato's view of the creation of the cosmos and man's place within it."
4,Great Translation,I have a big green book with all of Plato's dialogues and it is gibberish compared to this translation. The introduction is great and the book is poetry.
5,BF42 Rocks!,This is an award winning game and on top of the basic BF1942 game you get all the expansion packs as well. Great Value!
2,I should have read the reviews Battlefield 1942,"Will not run in Windows 7, I changed properties to have run in XP mode, it worked but poorly. I will give it to someone using Vista. That's if any such people still exist."
3,1 of 4?,"The Airborne is worth the price of admission, the others were pretty much dated and didn't care for them, i didn't complete a play through on any of the rest. I am probably spoiled by the newer graphics engines and am not in love with many of the ""classics"" as some others are. I expect far more than a rehash of Doom with the cheesy graphics,why buy a Cadillac to drive to the grocery store?The computer system I have built for gaming spit these curmudgeons out, pick and choose. (I gave it away)"
1,Game was bad.,"Games sucked, don't believe the hype. I was looking 4ward 2 playing this collection only 2 b very disappointed. Couldn't find 1 interesting thing about these game. Wouldn't recommend."
4,mouse and keyboard limited but fun and worth it,"I bought this after playing the ps2 version of modern battlefield 2. Its graphics aren't bad for being an older game. It came out in 2002 and other games included in it later. Nice shooter. It started the classes trend for shooters that is now the game standard. 10 dollars for 4 games can't be beat either. I like to be able to assign keys to a controller and avoid carpal tunnel problems. this can but you can't do all functions like the reticle movement which is very important. you will have to play with keyboard and mouse, but otherwise worth the buy."
5,fantastic product with fantastic service,"i wont go into detail about the game because everybody knows that its great. But i will say this package is great at a cheap price with battlefield 1942, both expansion packs and battlefield vietnam...since i have got these games i have wasted incredidble ammounts of time haha.the service was amazing i live in australia and the product came within 5 days and it was tracked, it was shipped as soon as the money went through."
2,Battlefield 1942: The Complete Collection,Doesn't compare to similar games within the last few years. I wouldn't buy any BF game that debut earlier than 2010.
4,omitted letters,"I haven't used the spanish version of this toy...but are the omitted letters ""ch"" and ""ll""? These letters have been officially ommitted from the Spanish alphabet within the past few years, at least in dictionaries and new textbooks. Just fyi."
1,still waiting for its closeup,"the smorgasbord approach is rarely satisfyingin a scientific excursion as proved here severaltimes (23) over -- there is no depth to this bookwhatsoever -anyone with a smattering of generalscience background will find the ground all toofamiliar and trying ---- add to this the author'sannoying and offputting arrogance as witnessed byhis uncalled for swipes against certain 19th centuryastronomers (simply because they couldn't guess theshape of the future) -- directly following his insults,this idiot proceeds to mangle the most basic informationthat our species has ever uncovered - the em spectrum! --his value for visible light being wrong by a factor of--wait for it -- one thousand!!!if only those past scientists were available for a rebuttaljustice might be served -- although come to think of it, maybethey wouldn't bother -- after all, they were astronomersnot entomologists"
5,Hydrogen,"An excellent description, not only of the Hydrogen atom, but the way that very simple structure informed scientists about more complex structures in the universe. Very well written and not mathematically intense."
4,Solid HH,"Like Field of Dishonor, the longish sequences of depression can get tedious. Still a good read overall."
4,The Most Important Film You Will See This Year...,"Or, ""impotent feelm"", in the words of the ""pimps"" portrayed. You know what I'm sayin'? Are any of these people real or is this all an act? Who cares?!! Go clothes shopping like a ""mack daddy"" (think purple bowlers and bright green and yellow alligator shoes)--you know what I'm sayin'?--attend the gala ""pimp of the year"" ball--you know what I'm sayin'?--watch big fat black prostitutes in six-inch heels waddling into nighttime traffic--you know what I'm sayin'? Of course you do! It can get a little boring in spots, but this is mostly a laugh riot. Be sure to shower afterwards!"
2,I don't know about this one,Watched it for 3 days and felt I didn't really get my moneys worth. So I am reselling it and hope that someone wants it. I won't be surprised if they don't. A waste of money.
2,My three sons in the saddle,"Bonanza was way to soft for my taste. I agree with Pernell Roberts the writing was just plain silly. I preferred Gunsmoke, Rawhide and Wagon train."
5,Bonanza,"If you are a fan of Bonanza or just starting out, this is a must-have. The video images are so clean and if have a high def tv, you think they are riding right into your living room. It great if you like classic tv, and it stands on its' own merits even today."
2,bonanza,These videos could have been made better. Th e videos are not as clear and the music isn't what iI remember.
2,"Cliches of Evil, more like","Your standard assortment of victims arrive at an isolated island castle to attend the reading of the will of Korvik, an unscrupulous industrial baron and scientist. The twist: Korvik felt that one of them was responsible for the lab accident that caused his slow, painful death, and nobody inherits until the others figure out who's the culprit. The other twist: somebody who looks a lot like the scarred Korvik is wandering around the castle's hidden passageways and killing people. This is a pretty standard 40's ""reading of the will"" murder mystery gussied up with some absurd science-fiction elements, like a chamber which fills with a gas that somehow reduces people to skeletons. Starring Scott Brady and a very down on her luck Virgina Mayo."
2,old movie,wasn't that bad ive seen way worse and i wanted it. the maid from will and grace was ln it it a b movie that wanted names and they wanted work and a studio made it has a good idea if somebody wanted to a remake jazz it up add better effects to itwouldn't be a bad movie
1,horrible horrible software,"This software was a total waste of money. It would randomly move the images I had imported, fail to save when told to do so, and bring my computer to a snail's pace. I have over a gigabyte of memory and this program would not work at all. Don't waste your money on this."
1,/sigh,"I have one thing to say to this crap. Jesus save my tattooed old school goth behind from your followers. What a silly, hysterical woman. I am more concerned about saving my daughter from people like her."
1,No good,"I read the reviews here and purchased the book. Felt cheated, it is a waste of money and time. Utterly boring, and fake. The protagonist is supposed to be from India, but her descriptions of India sound like it is her first visit to an exotic land."
1,here we go again,"this book is ok written but i am sick of seeing novels that make out that Indian parents don't care if their kids are happy or not as long as they are married. This is often NOT the case. This is just rubbish, sorry I did not like it and I don't think anyone in my reading group did!"
2,all dressed up and goes no where.,maggie Z saidit all. Just when you thik the heroine has come into her own. BAM there comes the (boring) happily ever after. This book is nothing but fluff. But if you want an easy read go for it!
4,One of the best tribute albums out there,"If you're a fan of European power metal then this album is for you.Excellent choice of bands and songs to be covered.I wish there were more songs from Michael Kiske era but it's good nevertheless.couple of criticisms..1) I am a fan of Sonata Arctica but I felt Hammerfall did a better job covering ""I want out"".2)Hammerfall were unjustly excluded from this album.3)Why isn't Stratovarius on this one?If you got Luca you might as well have Timo doing Hansen's riffs.However,female vocals on ""Helloween"" is something not to be missed.Dark Moor added a nice symphonic touch to the song."
3,a badly mixed bag...,"While I don't claim to be the biggest Helloween fan ever, I'm familiar enough with the band to be able to judge covers of their songs, and the results in this case are all over the place.About one third of the songs on this CD (Guardians, I Want Out, Judas, Halloween) are on par with their original Heloween counterparts. Another couple (I'm Alive, Eagle Fly Free, Future World) are considerably less stunning, but still worthy to be a part of the album. The rest of the songs range from dissapointing (Savage, Ride The Lightning, How Many Tears, Little Time) to disturbingly awful (Save Us, Victim Of Fate).I'm sure hardcore Helloween fans will still find plenty to love and listen to from this album, as there are a fair number of decent songs. It may even bring back some nostalgia or something. For the average power metal fan, however, this is a sub-par effort and any actual Helloween CD would be a far better purchase than this."
5,favorite author,"Discovered Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe several years ago, loved every one.This is another character Tecumseh Fox and I was not disappointed.Stoutmay have written in '30 and '40 but stories are timeless."
5,Double for Death,This is a book consisting of two short stories. Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin are at their best in these stories.
1,Not enough suction for carpet.,"I was disappointed in this machine as soon as I plugged it in. It does not pick up dog hair out of area rugs or carpets. It worked well on hardwoods, but don't waste your money on this machine. The ""turbo"" nozzle is anything but ""turbo"". It needs electricity going to it to be effective, the suction just isn't enough as is.Beware of who you buy from and what their return policies are. Vacuums of America charged me a restocking fee of 15% even though it doesn't state that anywhere on their Amazon pages. They were even aware that it doesn't state that and were willing to not charge me 15% restocking fee if I purchased a different vacuum from them. Shady operation. Now I am going through the Amazon A-Z return guarantee to get the rest of my money back."
4,Phone battery,Works well however does not eliminate background noises which built up in GE telephone system before old battery was replaced. Cheaper to replace through Amazon that to purchase at local electronics outlets.
5,Great Gift!,"Bought this for my Fiance as a gift. BIG QUEEN and Freddie Mercury fan so this was a sure hit...he said there are a few songs that are the same and remixed, but overall the album is played 24/7 at my house. Great buy for the Queen and Freddie Mercury fan in your life. Also could not find this album at all not even Best Buy! Great price too!"
2,OLD SCHOOL RAPPIN .....,"I DON'T CARE FOR MUCH OLD SCHOOL RAPPIN.BUT THE ONLY TRACK I LIKE ON THIS ALBUM WOULD HAVE TO BE # 10 ""DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE A GANGSTA"".DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH IT.I BOUGHT IT CAUSE I WAS CURIOUS."
1,disappointing very brief not funny,"disappointing very brief not funny, very brief and must be looking for some line and trying to find who said it etc not what I thought"
3,Great ... but not so great,"I am a die-hard fan of Bananarama (since 1984), so thrilled to see this album released. When I saw TRICK OF THE NIGHT included in this 12"", I was so happy! Had been looking all over for that remix for ages (I only got it in LP), I couldn't care less about the rest of the tracks.It is overall a great album, but quite disappointed with some of the remixed tracks. I am really looking forward for The Twelve Inches of Bananarama Part II. Anyone?"
4,About Time,"It was way overdue for this Remix CD to come out. I am so happy to see the old mixes of some of my favorites: A Trick Of the Night, More Than Pyshical.It would have been nice to have tracks from Please Yourself on this compilation."
2,Not recommended if you are new to ham.,"This book is just a copy of the question pool with a very brief description of the answers. If your goal is to learn about, and understand amateur radio then your money is probably better spent on ""Now You're Talking!"" if you just want to memorize the question pools instead you can do that online for free with practice tests.If you are new you should really consider NYT instead so you not just pass the test, but understand the basic technology and rules behind amateur radio."
2,Not worth $10,"You have to get the dolls to go with it. The hair accessories are break easily, but my daughter loves the hair piece."
5,Manual for Children's Deliverance,Well done. This manual takes into account the special deameanor required in this area so as to not frighten or upset the very young and make them more vulnerable to forces they cannot quite understand.
1,BAAAD,"The battery was bought a few weeks ago, but it's already acting like it's at least a year old (barely holds a charge), not brand new -as the seller contends."
2,batteries for LG CU500,"These batteries are worse than the ones they replaced. They constantly shut the phone completely off on a full charge. My last batteries don't hold a charge long, but are still much better. Where can I find genuine LG batteries & NOT generic?"
1,The Scriptures are NOT for sale!,If you would like to obtain a copy of the Scriptures FREE OF ANY CHARGE contact your local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses or write to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. We would be happy to give you a free copy of the New World Translation of The Holy Scriptures. Don't be fooled into paying for any of our literature.
1,Total Lies!!!,"This ""bible"" is full of nothing but lies! To all the jehovahs witness people out there I truly feel sorry for you.I mean how bright are you people? Anyone reading this book really needs to have their head examined!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not a reliable translation.,"If you're looking for an accurate translation of the Holy Scriptures, this is definitely not it. The NWT presents unique and controversial bible renderings at every turn, and - wow - these unique renderings just happen to support the un-christian teachings of the Jehovah's Witnesses who publish the book. When you write to the Watchtower Society to get a list of the translators and their professional qualifications, guess what you get? NO RESPONSE! It is the only bible in the world that won't identify its translators. This combination should be enough to scare you away from buying the book, but if it's not, just go to a few Witness ""bible studies."" That experience should convince you that neither the Witnesses nor their bible is interested in understanding God's word."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"Not What I Was Expecting, The Seller Failed To Mention That The Book Has Major Stains On The Edge Of The Book."
4,New World Translation,The book came in good shape. I'm not an advocate of the NWT bible; I'm using it for reference when comparing other versions of Scripture.
3,Eye Opener,I bought this book because I kept hearing about all the differences in the JW Bible and my Bible. Well after taking my Bible and Jehovah Witness Bible I can understand why I should not want them at my house. They have taken words out and added there own words. In doing so change the meanings of what was meant in the scriptures. I am so glad I got this book and did what I did because I didn't this when I let them in my house and read there scriptures they were so different. I thought they had the same bible as every one else. Boy was I wrong. I don't want them preaching there Bible to me anymore. This is my opinion.
1,This is NOT a Christian bible.,"The scriptures have been twisted, added to, taken from, and very little resembles the Word of God in it. Definitely not a good choice of a bible for anyone who wishes to know God."
5,Most Accurate and Easily Understood Version of the Bible,"The New World Translation has been carefully translated from the original languages for the most accurate and easy to read version of the Bible you'll ever read! It also restores the use of God's name, Jehovah, which appears in the original language texts over 7,000 times. However, this Bible and many other publications are available free of charge at your local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses. (Donations are appreciated but neither required nor solicited.) : )"
5,Great Sound in a small speaker,"I am currently running 9 NANOSATs plus the sub-woofer on my ONKYO tx-sr607, and they sound amazing. I love being able to switch between the new PLIIz and the PLIIx sound fields as well as the other sound fields on the ONKYO. The NANOSATs do exactly as advertised; you get an enveloping sound environment from the omnidirectional speakers and the sub-woofer delivers a bass that is perfect for my room (18'x14'). I ordered, as an add-on to the 5 NANOSATS I already had, and paid for the original 5.1 system (with the silver and black design) and I received the newer more expensive version (all black)....no complaints here. If you are thinking of getting the NANOSATs and plan on using them more for TV and movies than music, these speakers are the way to go. Music sounds great with these speakers too, but some people might not like the omnidirectional sound for music."
3,A tremendous compmendium of photos from a bygone era in F1,"An oversized book filled with Ranier Schlegelmilch's magnificent photos of F1 in the 1960s, an era where the faces of the drivers were not yet hidden by full-visored helmets and where there were no gravel pits or armco barriers to limit the photographer's scope. The portraits of the racers are coupled with written profiles that encapsulate the essence of the man, in three languages. A comprehensive, black and white trip down memory lane."
1,not worth it,This was a descent heater for a year. It stopped working and had to be replaced almost a year to the date.
2,This camera is the worst,"I recently purchased this camera and thought it would be the best bang for the buck. I took it out of the box, read the instructions, and began to use it. To my dismay, when I played the footage I took on my TV, I found that the picture was pixelated and the sound would keep cutting off. I called Sharp customer service and they were not able to solve my problem. Nevertheless, everything else seemed to work fine. The infrared worked perfectly and I was very happy with the stills. It is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. Other people seem to have better luck than me, except for one other person who had the same problem. Overall, I would not recommend this camcorder."
4,"Get away from it, no matter how good the deal it is.","~I didnot trust those negative reviews at the time I jumped into a deal when sharp offered a ...rebate on this model.I tested the camcorder with a blanktape playing and did not see the problem on the common reported tape mechanical problem. I felt I was lucky.Well, 5 months after the purchasing, with less than 1 tape shooting time, it exhibited the exact the same problem! It ate tapes! Mine situation is worse, after several try, it now rejects any tapes into the compartment.Called"
1,disappointing,"too low qualityFrom the beginning, the quality of the record is too low. I can't watch most of the time after recorded."
2,"Tempting, but...","The picture quality of the recorded video is really not any better than my 3-year old analog Hi 8 camcorder.The medium to low light performance is poor. The recorded images were very noisy in average to low light conditions.The menu system was fairly easy to use. Once through the manual was enough.The recorded sound quality is very good.The price is very good.If I was a first-time camcorder owner, I would be pleased with this product. I don't recommend it to someone moving up from an analog camcorder to a digital camcorder.I returned mine after a week of use."
4,great bbs but...,"These are great bbs, but when they came the box was all smushed then when I opened it three of the bottles tops where broken and they spilled bbs all in the box. But also just might have somthing to do with how it was shipped so it might not happen to you. Other than that its a better deal than buying them at the store because you could get only 4,000 for the same price (plus shipping cost)."
3,"Great Background, so-so execution","Typical of FASA, this product has a richly detailed and imaginative background. The rule set leaves something to be desired. They have two-dimensional aerial combat! Ick! Given this major flaw, it's still much better than the never sufficiently cursed AeroTech rules they put out for their Battletech game. If you played their Renegade Legion game, you will know these rules. FASA took the Crimson Skies universe from their video game group (now owned by Microsoft), stuck on an existing rule set and got out a boxed board game set. It's delightful eye candy, but IMO, overpriced. A Crimson Skies expansion module costs as much as a full blown sourcebook in Steve Jackson's Games GURPS line. Another major flaw in Crimson Skies is the lack of a Role Playing Game add on. Mechwarrior breathed life into their Battletech line. Not having this aspect weakens the Crimson Skies line. The three stars are strictly for their development of the really cool Crimson Skies background."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"This is an absolutely fantastic movie for all members of the family. Everyone I have shown it to also have loved it. Get this and their new movie, ""Facing the Giants"" and plan some great family movie nights."
4,Very Uplifting Movie,"The Movie Flywheel is a very uplifting movie. The movie is not nearly as believable as their next movie, Facing the Giants, but it is still a pretty decent movie. This is the producers/writers first attempt to do a full length movie and although the characters are not quite as strong as the ones in Facing the Giants they still provide the viewer with some good clean family entertainment."
3,Good Start,Great family film with a great message. Anyone looking for a good family film will be pleased with this. This is the first in a series of Christian films.
4,Flywheel,This film had a clear message and though it was somewhat on the amateur side I thoughly enjoyed it. Well done for what little it cost to produce!
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"I bought this just so I'd had a big enough purchase to get free shipping on the books that I was ordering. I don't remember which books I got, but I won't forget this film. Sure it doesn't contain top cinematography or acting. It won't appeal to a worldly person because there is no real action. The amount of emotion displayed is not even significant. The amount of emotion generated was though. I had tears in my eyes and a chill down my spine for several minutes watching a man choose to follow God no matter what the outcome. I enjoyed it just as much, if not more, than Facing the Giants - and I'm a big football fan. Putting this together on a $20,000 budget was nothing short of miraculous.Donald James ParkerAuthor of Love Waits"
3,Review for Flywheel,"This DVD was shipped the day after I ordered it, which was phenominal. However, the price was twice as much as one of the DVDs I ordered the same day. That is why I didn't give a 5 star rating."
5,What a blessing!! A must see.,This movie will change your life if you let it. Watch it with your entire family. Get the rest of the movies from these folks.
5,Must See Movie,"Everyone else has told you much about the movie, I would just like to say as well, this is a wonderful movie. People often think that things have to be dirty, and be loaded with cursing and sex for people to like it. The popularity of Flywheel, Facing the Giants, and now Fireproof prove that people do want to see something like these movies. Something without profanity and sex. Something that deals with real life problems and shows how you can overcome them in the Lord."
4,Great story. Not the greatest quality production,"This is, I guess, the first movie by this group of people from a church. They have a great story. It's fun, funny and penetratingly serious at times. It does lack the Hollywood professional lighting, etc. but that almost adds to the ambience as you watch. You can see the people, get to know them almost and enjoy it with them. THey are having a great time doing what they do. THey director's cut is much better because of all the extras and the personal behind-the-scenes touch. You'll enjoy it. It may not be appropriat for the youngest of viewers."
4,Excellent!,"This is Alex Kendrick's first movie. It is obviously a low budget production, but it is amazingly GOOD!! The characters are very realistic and the movie has a good message. The world doesn't seem to understand the reality of the Christian culture. For me, Flywheel and Facing the Giants depicted every day life with its problems. I didn't realize Facing the Giants was done by the same group when I first saw it (or I would have seen it sooner). Considering the budget for Flywheel was probably almost non-existent, it's a great film. It's good to see that Kendrick was able to move onto Facing the Giants and do a first rate production in every way. I'm waiting for more."
4,REFRESHING MOVIE,Finally a movie I can watch with my married children and don't have to be embarassed to death. Really made us talk as a family. Some of the family had tears in their eyes.
5,Very uplifting!,I loved this DVD and all the others made by these creators. I've ordered all of their other ones for myself and also for my grown children. These are to be watched more than once and also shared with others.
5,A Movie every man must watch,You follow the story of Jay Austin who turns from bad salesman to good salesman. He also takes a major change in how he does business. He looks at reality and see how his wife and kid views him. He decides he does NOT want to be who he was and has a desire to really change. I will not give away the movie but at the same time you need to watch it. It will sit there and make you examine who you really are.
1,misleading,"I love de niro, and I love movies from all genres and all time periods but this movie was awful. I bought it because I found it for 5.88 and a lot of places didn't have it in their warehouse so I figured it might be rare. The box of the dvd makes it out to be a de niro film which its not. After the first scene when he is killed within the first 3 minutes I looked at the case to see if De niro was a star. The story line is awful, right from the beginning you know what will happen in the end and if you do watch this movie pay attention to the end it just isn't real. The last 15 minutes is absurd. The dvd case said there was extra features such as a trivia, filmography and biographies there wasn't even a scene selection area. The movie quality looks like it came straight from a vhs and and the sound is awful. If you are a de niro fan and you want to see this movie go for it, but just know what its actually like and don't go by the box cover."
3,Don't 'Swap' this film,"It would be true to say that this film is only worth seeing for the early performance of the greatest actor EVER (Robert De Niro). The story is weak, the film is choppy, (actually put together by two directors over a couple of years). The DVD is cheap in price and cheap in quality. This DVD has had even less work put into it than the movie had. A cheap looking cover, splashing De Niro all over it. Needless to say for De Niro fans only. (Find the director's, let's get a special edition director's cut out there on the shelves)"
2,Disappointing,"I expected this to be a swashbuckling tale on the high seas with tons of action and plenty of romance. I was sorely disappointed.While Sabrina Jeffries is known as as bestselling author, this was obviously not one of her best. I didn't like Gideon Horn's (our hero) take-over attitude nor did I care for his bitter attitude. He wasn't really a likable character. And while Sara Willis (our heroine) had a great personality--strong, independent, vulnerable--I wasn't buying into her attraction to Gideon. A reformer who falls in love with a pirate? It's a great concept, but the actual plot was a bit lacking. I think Jeffries could have written this with a little more...flair, I think, is the word I'm looking for."
1,Did not finish,This was one of the very few books that I couldn't bring myself to finish. The heroine just grated on my nerves too much.
3,.,I loved the storyline and the characters were very engaging but there were many grammar errors and words mushed together.
5,Secrets,As with all previous books written by this authoress this book deserves its 5 star rating. Well researched and interesting to the very last page.
1,LOL~!,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well.I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL"
1,False advertising!! Watch out,"This is not the real product, and Ritz is not the real vendor. Apparently they have some other reseller called D&H list items on their behalf whithin the Amazon site. Originally this item was listed as a real IBM product, in fact it is an eReplacements product, but D&H used the bait and switch tactic of changing their ad details after I purchased. Then claimed I should not get a full refund. I had to get Amazon involved and they took care of the issue 100%. But who wants to waste time with a purchase - I just want what I paid for; don't do business with these folks, they are dishonest!"
1,not reliable. worked well only for a few uses.,"I was happy with the smoker for only its first few runs, the 4th run, it stopped heating, so i unplugged the electric thermostat control prong only to find where it fits into the smoker had actually melted. the once shiny and straight metal prong had become deformed and the receptacle looked burnt out, the plastic around it had melted.A side note, the unit was bent in a few areas upon arrival to the extent that the cover did not fit on the smoker, i had to use pliers to bend the smoker in order to get the lid to fit, tho it never fit snugly.I'm returning it tomorrow."
1,"MISSING PARTS, SELLER WON'T RETURN CALLS/EMAILS","I am very disappointed in this product. There were missing parts to make this unit unuseable and I immediately contacted the seller and they did not contact me back. I purchased this as a gift and I make a lot of purchases on Amazon and this is my first bad experience. Amazon is now telling me that I can't get a refund through them because their refund only covers:1) When the buyer provided payment to the seller, but the seller failed to deliver the item.2) When the buyer received the item, but the item was materially different than as depicted in the seller's description.I am very disappointed in the way this matter was handled. If only the seller would've called / emailed so I could tell them what missing parts so I could use this but they aren't responding to any requests.I would highly recommend buying a different smoker."
2,Not well built,"This smoker creates some terrific Bar B Q, but the construction of this smoker is disappointing. After two years of use, we have to replace it. The metal lid warped the first time it was used, which means the lid and body don't fit together well. The biggest problem, though, is that the electric control is flimsy and must be jiggled constantly or it stops cooking. This smoker was recommended by Cook's Magazine, and while the food is terrific, poor construction means that after only two years of infrequent use, we have to replace it."
1,Meco Electric Smoker review,"Ordered the Meco 5030 electric smoker just a couple of days before Thanksgiving. Unit would not get hot enough never reaching the ""ideal"" temperature range after about three hours of operation. I had to disengage my smoking and proceed to back-up plan of cooking the turkies in the oven. Not what I wanted to do!After the holiday, I called Meco and complained. To their credit, they were quick to respond and offered to send a new element and electrical control. Just received those items and have not had time to install. But, to say I was disappointed is an understatement. The construction of this product is very cheap, not at all what I expected. It was a little dinged up from shipping. The lid does not fit very tight. If you want to go cheap, I would suggest a Brinkman which is considerably less expensive but about the same quality.I believe that for my next smoker, I will invest in a Green Egg!"
4,Shadow Riders,This book was more interesting than the previous ones. I would reccomend it to anyone interested in this type of story.
3,For 9-12 year olds?,This book is better for children older than 11 maybe 11-13 because 9 year olds and even my 10 year olds were not able to get into it. It is a good book and is worth reading even if the kids have to wait a few years to fully understand it. Some how books like this are better read aloud by teachers who understand the literature.
4,Still not bad,"I have had this camera for approximately 4-1/2 years now, and it's still a good product. The only complaints I have are that (1) it doesn't connect to the computer in any way, and there are no longer products out that will convert the RCA cables into a USB input. (2) The battery will not hold any type of charge whatsoever anymore - I have to plug the camera into a wall to be able to use it, and replacement batteries are near impossible to find at ridiculous prices. From Sharp directly it's a $50 battery. I managed to find one at Fry's for about $30, but it's still NiMH and I would like to find a lithium-ion so we don't have this problem again. Other than that, it's a wonderful camera, and I absolutely love it."
1,Cover picture is incompetently picked and totally irrelevant!,"Hey, even kids know who is the persons on the cover picture!This is Taras Shevchenko, famous Ukrainian poet and painter: [...]For the record, the picture on the cover is an incompetent pick and has nothing to do neither with this book nor with author!I would take it as expression of disrespect towards potential readers, pardon me, listeners."
1,A new Famous Error - Unique collection,"This CD is really unique. The famous Ukrainian writer, poet and painter on the title page has no correlation at all to Dostoevsky. So, if you like to collect something interesting, this is for you! It looks like Charles Dickens portrait on Edgar Allan Poe books."
3,I would have gotten more of it if i'd read it in school,This book is beautifully written. I didn't much like it though. There were so many digressions from the main story that i got a bit lost at times. I had no problems keeping the characters straight but did not enjoy trying to remember who followed which philosophy. Glad i read it but i know i didn't properly understand it.
3,Not what I was expecting!,"The cover was completely different from the picture on display. Also the book looked and smelled like it was 60 years old. The pages were brown and fragile. Within one week of regular use, the cover fell off and the pages started to come apart. I ended up having to go to a bookstore and buy a new one. According to the seller, however, the book was in ""good"" condition. I would have liked to know exactly what the book looked like before I spent money on it!"
1,defective DVD,"I am a huge Columbo fan, however, I was most disappointed at the quality of the 3rd Season DVD set. The first film kept pausing and playing, pausing and playing. It's most annoying and ruins the viewing experience. Upon closer inspection I find there is a manufacturing error. The oil used to produce the DVDs has obviously not settled well and thus not produced the DVDs to the quality that is required.I have now asked for an exchange hoping that I'll get one from a decent batch, failing that I will return it again for a full refund."
4,columbo the great,i'm a great fan of columbo but the seasons seem to be getting shorter as they go along with not as many episodes being included in the sets. episodes included in this season are lovely but lethal(martin sheen and vincent price) any old port in a storm (george gaynes and dana elcar) candidate for crime (jackie cooper and katey segal) double exposure (robert culp and ann driscol) publish or perish (jack cassidy and mariette hartley) mind over mayham (jose ferrer and diedre hall) swan song (johnny cash) and a friend in deed. this disc also has a bonus episode of mrs columbo (murder is a palour game)
2,3rd season on dual sided disks - not good,I have all the Columbo series. The third season is the only one that uses dual sided disks. This is the second set I have tried and one episode does not play correctly.I've tried the disk on 3 DVD players with the same relults. The first season 3 set had 3 episodes that would not play correctly so this is an improvement...It might be better to get season 3 at a local store so you can quickly return it until you get a set that plays correctly.
5,Six stars if possible...,"Each and every one of Columbo seasons are great and have something special but this third one stands as on of my personal favorites because of the plots and guests actors that are featured. LOVELY BUT LETHAL features the great Vera Miles, Martin Sheen and the one and only Vincent Price; ANY OLD PORT IN A STORM features the great Donald Pleasence in an outstanding performance as a wine industry man; CANDIDATE FOR CRIME features Jackie Cooper; DOUBLE EXPOSURE features Robert Culp; PUBLISH OR PERISH features Jack Cassidy and John Chandler; MIND OVER MAYHEM features Jose Ferrer; SWAN SONG, my personal favorite that features the great country legend Johnny Cash and actress Ida Lupino; A FRIEND IN DEED closes this extraordinary third season with the help of actor Richard Kiley."
3,Columbo is Good; but double sided discs were Bad,"I recently bought the series with high expectations and Columbo was up to it with beautiful stories and exemplary acting. But the Double sided discs were faulty, even when I got it replaced, and it kept ruining the excitement."
4,Excellent product. Lousy packaging.,"First, the good news. This DVD has 2 of the very best Columbo episodes. ""Swan Song"" and "" A Friend in Deed"" have excellent story lines, even for today. Child sex abuse,groupies, adultery and domestic violence are handled with tact and class. The points are made without being vulgar. The episodes aired on network TV in the 70's. Both are very well written. Did the writers win any Emmys? I must admit, I was hoping Johnny Cash got away. You see why celebreties and people of prominence feel they can get away with murder.Now, the bad news. Universal Studios should be ashamed for putting out bargain bin quality discs. There is no inner leaflet describing each episode. No pictures or anything on the discs. When you open the cover, you feel something is missing,especially for $[...]. Excellent Amazon.com price and excellent material, though."
2,Consumer be darned! Man the money machine,"So, why you ask, should a four star DVD rate a two star? Well, first, it could never rate a five star because of the hokey plots and contrived confessions. However, it is always great fun watching Peter Falk at his best as the crumpled Columbo...not really such a bumbler after all!! The problem is quality control gone bad of the actual DVDs. I have purchased double sided DVDs before. This is not my favorite format, but at least previous purchases have functioned. This set does not! I promptly returned the first order to Amazon. But, guess what, the exchange set was also whacked, albeit not as badly as the first one. At least the Johnny Cash episode played well, as did the ""Mrs. Columbo"" pilot which is worth watching, once. But, buy with no fear. The Amazon return/exchange program is excellent! Who knows. Perhaps your set will function smoothly. Still recommended."
4,Great book for the student,"I bought this for my Class on 1-2 Samuel at the Seminary. Good, easy and clear writing."
2,I Ain't Been Lucky In A Long Dang Time!,"I just watched the dang Troma movie Getting Lucky. And while we're on the dang subject of luck, let me say that I ain't got any. My dang toilet won't flush, we have a dang pest problem in our house, and I ain't been laid in a few dang months. And I have a dang bladder problem. I had to urinate two dang times just while watching this crappy movie! Getting Lucky is from Troma, of course. I've been a dang Troma fan since Justin Bieber was in dang diapers. Sure a lot of the dang movies they put out are crap, but I loved that dang Poultrygeist movie and a few of the dang Toxic Avenger movies. And Tales From The Crapper starring that dang sexy broad, Julie Strain. However, I did not love Getting Lucky. It's not very dang funny, and there isn't a whole lot of dang nudity for a teen sex comedy. Heck, I've seen more dang nudity in a hemorrhoid cream commercial. The dang bottom line is you ain't getting lucky if you're watching this dang movie."
2,"Looks nice, doesn't work","I like the stylish yet classic look of this watch. The face is easy to read, and the matte gold color is modern and attractive. However, the watch doesn't work very well. I don't know how, but the pin for setting the time comes out, and the watch stops keeping time. Since I really need the watch to keep good time at work, this is annoying."
4,Good Looking,"The flatware looks great. Much less expensive then my initial purchases of the flatware although also slightly different in size than the individual sets that I received during my wedding registry, but not very noticable."
5,"Delivered on time, no problems.","Everything went smoothly, product exactly what I ordered. Would definately not hesitate to order from this seller again."
5,I CANNOT WAIT!!!,I absolutely cannot wait for season six to be released. I'm in the Air Force serving overseas so I haven't seen season six. I bought seasons 2 through 5 and have season 6 on order. I watched seasons 2 - 5 last week w/ my husband and we're addicted! We're gearing up to watch season 1 tonight! I CANNOT WAIT!
5,what can you say its the best show ever!!!!,this is defintly the best show on tv since I love Lucy and it may be better than that. and too add to things this is the best season of friends that there is. there are some classics on this one. likle the one with the Unagi where ross is scared half to death by rachel and Phoebe. this is just the best season of the best show ever. so go out and buy it now
5,Fun and laughs continue,"Imagine my appreciation for this comedy when it continued to air 5 years after it premiered. Many shows I'd like would disappear in a few years, but this one would continue to remain popular with different storylines involving everyone in one way or another. Unlike most sitcoms that have me giggle or chuckle, this show would have me howl at times. A very good addition to your Friends collection. I'd purchased seasons 1 to 4 and ordered the rest here, so I'll post more reviews for seasons 7 to 10 in due time."
5,An excellent introductory electronics book,"Unfortunately I found this book only after having taking many electronics classes, but I still love it. I have enjoyed other books by Mr. Slone and if he were to write a more advanced electronics book, similar to this introductory book, I would buy it no questions asked."
1,lacking substance,"I'm halfway thru this book, and looking for an alternative. The author doesn't finish explaning a subject, instead gives an example that does not clearly explain the subject. Like another review, I'm looking for a book that shows the ""how"", and especially the ""why"", of electronics."
3,Not metal!,"I'll second what another reviewer wrote - although the photo on the product page appears to show something made of metal, the body of these things is PLASTIC.Having said that, they're decently made and cheap. So if you're not looking for something really heavy-duty, probably a good choice - they've worked well for me in hobby use. But I'm very careful not to tighten them too much!"
1,"Great book, but HORRIBLE reprint","This quality of this reproduction is EXTREMELY POOR. In fact, it looks like a counterfeit knock-off. There is no publisher's mark and it looks like a standard self-publishing job from a scan of the original book. The printed pages are small & almost unreadable and many of the illustrations are hard to make out. The real travesty is that the original by Ernest Thompson Seton is a great book. Amazon should pull this book and demand better quality."
5,Solid Construction - Very Happy!,"I did a lot of research before finally deciding to buy the OmniMount MWFS. I couldn't be happier with my decision. Many of the other wall mount shelving systems received negative reviews based on lack of stability. This unit does not have that problem. It is very sturdy, attractive, and has no problem holding up my 35 lbs Harman Kardon receiver along with the rest of my components. I've received several compliments on its appearance and the space savings is nice too!"
1,RUINED SURPRISE GIFT IDEA,"JUST RECEIVED THIS ITEM, PAID FOR EXPEDITED SHIPPING SO I CAN SURPRISE A FRIEND AS AN EARLY GIFT. AFTER CAREFULLY UNPACKING EVERYTHING, I DISCOVERED NONE OF THE HARDWARE WAS INCLUDED IN THE SHIPPING.IT TOOK ME ANOTHER HALF HOUR TO REPACK EVERYTHING AND IM HIGHLY ANNOYED I HAVE TO TAKE MORE TIME OUT OF MY SCHEDULE TO RETURN THIS AND NOT GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO GIVE AS A GIFT NOW!SINCERELY,DISAPPOINTED IN SUCH NEGLIGENCE CUSTOMER"
1,Poorly Designed,"The wall mount was the worst designed piece of furniture I ever put together. First off, some of the holes that were drilled in the mount were unequal. The option I chose was to have the 2 shelves on the lower half of the mount. When the mount was assembled and wires were connected, I went to put the cover pieces on and they didn't snap shut completely. The covers were crooked and showed some of the wires. It wasn't worth the $200.00 I paid."
3,Nights in Rodanthe,"When I first starting reading this book, I felt that it was very slow and did not understand the plot. The story starts off, as a sad women named Adrienne is dealing with the fact that her daughter is trying to grieving the death of her husband. She tells her about her time in Rodanthe and the man that changed her life. I think the book had a good theme to it, I just wish that it had a little more romance to it. Not one of Sparks best."
4,A Well Executed Work,Sparks manages to be fully engaging in a story of a short-lived romance. This is a shorter book; nice quick read that leaves you with a few feel good moments at the end!
3,Buy It Used,"Nights in Rodanthe was a good story, a quick read and it had some moving parts. But it just wasn't up to the level of Nicholas Sparks' earlier books. This seems to happen to a lot of authors who get very famous. I will still read and even look forward to his future books, but I won't be rushing out to buy them anymore. I feel a little let down like he's taking his readers for granted and putting stories out now using a formula. Come on, Nicholas, give us the good stuff again!"
1,"Been There, Done That...","I told myself that I would give Nicholas one more chance. I have always scoffed at his critics, but maybe they are right after all. How many times have we seen this before? A man and woman trying to escape their past, meeting and finding in each other a way to make a new future (Message, The Rescue, Bend in the Road, and now Rodanthe) set in a small North Carolina town with predictable romantic circumstances (alone at an inn with a storm outside and fire inside - haven't we seen that a few times)...it is enjoyable reading, but it isnt fresh or sharp or original anymore, and I don't think we should settle for that from a writer as good as Nicholas Sparks. I will wait for the paperback next time unless it's different from every other novel he has written. Please, Mr. Sparks, some originality again!!"
1,Male Danielle Steele,"Sappy, shallow romance written by a male. Danielle Steet fans should love this new offering by Nicholas Sparks. Fans who enjoyed earlier works by Sparks may be sadly disappointed, as I was."
5,For my Nicholas Sparks Book Collection,"Thank you. The book that I ordered and received was exactly what I wanted! I collect all of the larger size Nicholas Sparks's books with the artwork covers, so this book was a nice addition to my almost complete collection. :^)"
1,wow...this book isn't good,this was one of the cheesiest books i've ever read. there were times when i thought the book was just folly and making fun of real relationships and as i kept reading and found out they were serious i just wanted to laugh.
2,Drawn-out tearjerker,"Never read anything by Mr. Sparks before, and I generally don't read much in the romance genre. Somehow, just picked this up at the library, on impulse. The characters are stereotypes and not realistic ... the surgeon who was too busy to spend time with his children, but has now completely changed his ways; the self-sacrificing, angelic, divorced woman who somehow knows exactly the right words of advice to give others all the time. They fall deeply in love over the course of a few days. Frankly, much of the dialog just sounds awkward; the story is painfully drawn out, as if the author was trying too hard to conceal the ending from the reader, for as long as possible. The mother tells her story to the daughter, and the story magically heals the daughter's depression. It's all a silly fantasy, and the writing is full of cliches and is overly sentimental. Just another sappy tear-jerker."
2,Not Impressed,"I was not at all impressed with this book, despite many of the positive reviews by other readers. Although it was not completley boring and tedious to read, the main reason I didn't like it was because it was not at all believeable. The whole setup, and the idea that two people can fall so deeply in love in just one short weekend is ridiculous to me. Maybe it was because it only took about 3 or 4 hours to read the entire novel, so I didn't have sufficient time to really make a connection with the characters. Either way, when I was finished, I found myself laughing at the story that was supposed to draw a tear."
3,Not his best work,"I have written before that I am a fan of Sparks and have read all of his books except the new one, I'd pass on this one. He seems to be recycling his plot lines more and more, which I think he realized and picked up something new for ""The Guardian."" Normally by the first couple pages I am hooked and can't put the book down, but let's say this one was much easier to let go of. It's not a bad story, but it's not his best work. I recommend if you're going to read a Sparks book for the first time, don't choose this one."
2,Fresh Voice Needed,"I know I will upset many of Nicholas' fans (as I have been for many years), but I think his books have become like recycled sitcoms. The same thing every time. I think he just knows how to manipulate a scene to drum up emotion, but it's become old and tired. I have been with him for many novels, but I think it is time to look once again for a fresh new voice. Anyone have any recommendations??"
