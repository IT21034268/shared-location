3,Decent introductory text,"Kittel is a brilliant physicist, but not the greatest at helping beginners. So far this book (as well as the Thermal Physics book) in many spots feels rushed, almost like a summary rather than thoroughly explained concepts. Solid State is difficult to visualize, and the pictures are clear, but I do not think enough is offered to fully picture principals."
1,Don't buy this book,"Not worth your money. And if you have this book, you might as well donate it to some bum so he can burn it for heat"
3,A pretty average undergraduate solid-state text.,"Topics in the book are somewhat disjointed. This is probably a result of the author inserting new topics in each successive edition without really trying to integrate them into the text. Problems at the end of each chapter are not very illuminating. Can someone suggest a better ""modern"" text which covers recent developments such as scanning tunneling microscopy and semiconductor lasers?"
2,Hard for an introduction and disorganized.,"I don't like this book very much. As my first contact with Solid State Physics it proved, above all, disorganized. Sometimes you have to reread a paragraph (or a whole section) because the explanation to the beginning is in the end of it. I also felt a serious lack of physical intuition over the phenomena at stake. Sometimes two (would be) comparable graphics were side by side with totally different scales and looks, rendering the comparison difficult. Maybe as a reference it could be used, mostly because of the many tables encountered throughout it. But they are present in other (better) books too... As a comparison, I liked Ashcroft & Mermin's ""Solid State Physics"" a lot more. I am a student of Physics."
2,Why this book is reprinted for so many times?,"No need to say much: a bad book. He wanted to talk about everything in the book while there is nothing valuable in the text. If you compare this book with the Solid State Physics of Ashcroft and Mermin, you will also agree with me that this Kittel book is useless. But the book of Ashcroft and Mermin has nevered been reprinted since 1970s, really a pity."
5,If you've got the dinero. . . . buy this!,Great DVD!! I saw the Tornadoes live and this is every bit as good if not better. It's a wonderful tribute to Doug Sahm and Freddy Fender. Doug's showmanship and interaction with bandmembers and the audience make this one of the better CMT DVDs that I own. Freddy Fender was as soulful in this show as when he was 30 years younger. Plus - you just can't beat the blend of tex-mex and their rework of some old Sir Douglas songs.
1,"History of Carrollton Manor, Frederick County, MD.",I was very disappointed in this book. I thought it to be the complete book but found it contained only 238 pages and the portion I was interested in was on page 367. Obviously this was a condensed form of the book which was not conveyed in the description on line.
5,Hilarious!,"Wow, this author has a sense of humour that is quite dry and witty. Reminds me of childhood realities!"
4,Great CD to have in your 311 collection,"I had to have this CD after a friend let me listen to the first song. Don't Tread On Me is a great song and the message it has is great. It's a fun and playful song. I love 311 and think they are great music to listen to especially in the summer time. They have a reggae feel about them and their music just makes you feel calm, relaxed, and happy. If you haven't given 311 a chance you need to."
2,Saddly uninspired,"I find it hard to believe that 311 is just going through the motions but songs like Frolic Room, Speak Easy, and waiting leave me asking what they were smoking. This album is just simply uninspired, it is certainly not what I have come to expect from 311 - solid, awesome, impressive music - this is no where near that. The title track intro was an immediate turn off as I was praying that it was a song about to rag on bad 80's glam-rock or something but instead it just seems like a poorly constructed intro. There are a few decent songs but nothing stands out and I certainly can't imagine wanting to hear any of this live...overall this album is just an embarrassing bump in an otherwise empressive catalgue hopefully next time around they think of their long time loyal fans and write some more inspired offerings. Bottom line wait till it's cheap on ""used and new"" but don't waste the money you'll regret this purchase."
2,worst 311 ever,"I have been a fan since the beginning and yes I can name more than 5 songs. But anyway, I never thought that 311 could make a bad album but they did. I returned it 2 hours after I bought it.Don't waste your money."
4,They've still got it!!,"For anyone that was diasppointed by ""Evolver"", I think you'll be pleased to hear this new one, and find that they brought it back to the 311 we know and love!! This new one definitely has the feel of ""Grassroots"" and ""311"" and what not. The good stuff!Rock on, as always, 311!!!"
4,311 does it decently,"311 is the sh-t. They always will be.I dont know what they were trying to do with this alblum, but it kinda worked.About half the songs are good on the cd, which isn't bad. Solar Flare and Don't Tread on me, being the best. Closely followed by Frolic Room and Speak Easy.311 changed their sound. But in a more poppy and island way. It's ok, but its not what 311 fans expected.But that doesn't matter, because the band gets to evolve however they want. Some will like it, others wont.It's not bad, but don't expect the heavy in-your-face music, they are known for."
3,"A ""safe"" album for 311","While definitely not 311's highest caliber, ""Don't Tread On Me"" is a safe middle ground for the veteran band.It has all the good aspects of 311 from the past, however, the album misses the punch. The tracks are short, bland, and filled with mostly catchy bridge and verse.One tremendous improvement is SA's singing. In the past he has done well with harmonizing with Nick and doing his own raps. But this album proved that he can finally stand on his own as a singer like in tracks ""Getting Through to Her"" and ""Speak Easy."" It seems as though he has gotten some coaching on how to project a little better, and it definitely worked.However, the entire album fails to pass mediocre level. A longer, stronger album would have been better."
2,"I know I'm ""supposed"" to like this band, but...","I'm not sure why, but I feel almost angry at Bigelf for making this kind of music. And by ""this kind of music"", I'm talking about how every song sounds like a swirling psychedelic ocean of circus music with Ozzy or Jeff Lynne at the mic. That doesn't sound like a bad thing at all, but the way Bigelf does it really annoys my earballs. I dunno...I expected better. That's what I'm really tryin' to say here."
3,The Best Bed & Breakfast 2001-2002,"Does not show websites which would be valuable in selecting a bed and breakfast. Does not show counties on pages with photos,, which makes it difficult to locate properties. Lists properties by owners instead of by name of bed & breakfast on the summary pages, such as p. 323 for Somerset, Bath & Bristol. Does not have page numbers on every page. Too many photos. Money saving offer is deceptive, as it only applies during slack seasons, and only in London."
2,No shine. Oily.,"I don't get this product.Was looking for it to create that promised shine.Instead, what I got was an oily greasy surface.Has to use other cleaners to take it off and get back the shine."
2,Disappointed...,"I hit 46 this year so I decided I had better take a little care of my face. In my search for a moisturizer and sunscreen I found L'Oreal Men's Expert Vita Lift Anti-Wrinkle & Firming Moisturizer. While it says non-sticky on the box, it felt very sticky even an hour after putting it on plus you feel like something is covering your face. One reviewer mentioned that it had no fragrance. It does and is listed in the ingredients. It has a very flowery smell that is not for me. I am wondering if this is simply something from the woman's product line repackaged for men?"
2,Not as show,"The moisturizer is great, but they send me the one with no SPF 15 (the old one), not the one show."
4,Included?,Well built but as this is for my first Hummingbird in quite some time I was surprised that it did not come with the sonar as is the case with lowrance products. I would recommend the product.
2,"Slow, slower. slowest","Ditto to all reviewers who lament the old white 4-cup. I bought the 5-cup a couple of years ago. Makes decent coffee. But the carafe drips unless you pour very carefully and the warming plate doesn't do a good job of keeping the coffee hot. My major complaint is that it takes 25 minutes to brew a pot of coffee. I give it a vinegar treatment regularly and remove and clean the water tank. Trouble is, after exhaustive research, I don't think there's a small electric drip coffee maker that fills the bill. The old 4-cup is still in the garage, seriously stained, pitted and ugly. I'm tempted to haul it out, but I'm now used to that extra cup."
5,A great book on a great artist.,"Gerald Scarfe is an amazing caricaturist, and one of my favorite artists. This is an excellent, colorful book that chronicals the British cartoonist's rise to fame, from his days as a sickly bed-ridden child to the editorial cartoonist of England's biggest newspaper. There are full-color drawings and photos a-plenty, with lots of interesting images of his work for the British theatre and the animated segment of Pink Flyod's infamous ""Wall"" film. Its also full of interesting insights and ancedotes from the author. A great book on a great artist."
3,"Not enough, but a good book none the less","It would have been a much better book with color illustrations and comparison photos of different locks close together, but it is still a very good book on this subject and I recommend it."
2,Wouldn't buy another,I wouldn't purchase this again because it lacks a lot of the towns and cities on it.
4,SKB cornet case,Case is very durable and looks nice. My son was able to attach a shoulder strap to the case and ride to band practice on his scooter.
1,Suppose you wrote a book and nothing happened,This is what it would look like. The plot makes no sense at all. The character keep missing the obvious and when do figure it out the reader just shakes their head. Next.....
5,Definitely worth the wait!,"Anne McCaffrey did a great job of joining both the Rowan and Pegasus series together with ""Pegasus in Space."" I would have wished for a bit more fleshing out and a bit more of a stand alone style. But other than that, it is a great book. Her naming convention of ships is fantastic!Well worth the read."
1,Avoid the Kindle version,"The Kindle version of this book is awfully. The pages look as if someone just slapped them down on a scanner, scanned them to a digital format, and uploaded them. The publisher gave no thoughts to aligning the digital pages with the pages of the actually book. Navigating through the chapters is a nightmare with the index function which would normally be used to at least navigate from chapter to chapter in Kindle being non functional. As to why there are so many blank pages throughout this book is beyond me, and chapter titles appear on one page with the actually start of the chapter appearing several pages after. If possible just get the actually book and avoid the digital version."
2,Old information,This book is filled with information that many years ago was timely. It is outdated and was not worth the effort that it took to read.
2,As cheap as you'd expect,"I thought I'd save some time and money buying a notebook online instead of heading to the campus bookstore. Bad idea. Without being able to see the product before purchase, I had no way of knowing how cheap it was.The pages are not perforated, but sometimes they rip out easily because the edge is cut too close to the spiral binding. The binding also works its way out of the pages because there is nothing at the ends to keep it in place. The notebook is also floppy, so it needs to be resting on a flat surface in order to turn the pages.Next time I need a notebook, I'm spending more money, and examining it in person first."
2,Good price poor quality very flimsy,"The note books were a great price however the back and front covery are very flimsy an tear easily, would not recommend for school projects."
5,It’s a notebook,I had some extra cash and bought this......... .......... ......... ......... ......... .......... ...... . . .. . . .
3,Silly Me,Reading is fundamental -- for some reason i saw the photo of multple notebooks and thought that I was getting a great deal on a pack of notebooks. In reality you are getting ONE notebook. In which case i could have gotten this cheaper at a store. My fault for not reading the details properly and assumning that the picture reflected what I was buying.
4,"Good Notebook, High Price","I have used these notebooks for taking notes in class. They are durable and handy. I like having one notebook dedicated for each subject or class. It helps to keep things better organized. However,I do prefer the narrow ruled better and I usually wait until just before the new school year, usually in August, and go to WalMart and buy them 10 for a Dollar. If you can wait and plan ahead you can get them for a much better price."
1,The rubber ball stinks!,"This rubber medicine ball stinks literally! It smells like it was dipped in gasoline, the smell is unbearable!"
4,A nice addition to the workout set,"I've never purchased or used a medicine ball before, but in my winding and inconsistent quest to get in shape, I bought this. It operates as its own workout at this weight without being too big or bulky. It has good elasticity too, in case you're bouncing it off of something (hopefully something sturdy, due to its mass). The paint peels very easily, which is more of a nuisance than anything else. There's at least one extra layer of paint beneath it, but finding the little yellow pieces all over the place isn't all that great. It's a good product on the whole, though."
2,Valeo 8Lb. medicine ball,"It takes about a month to ship. This is much too long for a shipment without any reason why.It seems this item wouldn't be so hard to produce and be on such backorder.For the price, I guess it's worth the wait, but I'm still shopping elsewhere for one."
1,i didn't like it,i think the have no talent and they are just friends with the judges on THE CUT. hahahaha
4,there stands!,"They hold up speakers like no other stand, and you get two of them in a box! what a deal."
5,Best Soundtrack I've ever heard,"I loved this album. All the songs on it describe every moment in the movie perfectly. I'd say my favorite songs on this soundtrack are: ""Colorblind"" by Counting Crows and ""This Love"" by Craig Armstrong. The entire album is beautiful and every song is beautifully written. I hope anyone who has seen the movie buys this album."
2,Verve steals the soundtrack.,"Easily, the best track on this CD is ""Bitter-SWEET Symphony"". I listened to this soundtrack at a special screening of the movie two weeks ago. The soundtrack fails to capture the romance between Phillippe and Witherspoons, and focuses only on the more ""explicit"" themes of the movie."
4,Great Soundtrack!! Just like the movie:-),"At first I didn't like the c.d., but the more I listened to it, the better it got. Now I love it and it's especially great for cruizin around in my Jeep with the top off. Usually soundtracks suck because not all of the songs in the movie are on the c.d., but this ""Cruel Intentions"" kicks ass. Ryan P. is HOT!! My favorite movie!!"
5,Great Soundtrack!,"It was a great soundtrack. I liked Placebo's Every You and Every Me, Bedroom Dancing, and Bittersweet Symphony.I just wish they had put the music to the trailer on the soundtrack."
4,No Instrumental Pieces :'-(,"I loved the movie ""Cruel Intentions,"" the soundtrack is really really really good! There are some incredibly good songs on it which were featured in the movie. The only concern that I have w/ the whole CD is that there are no instrumental pieces on it! Throughout the movie, there were some excellent instrumental pieces which they failed to include on the CD. I would have given it 5 stars if they were included, but otherwise, the CD is wonderful!"
3,Counting Crows Steals it....,"The soundtrack as a whole stinks, but Counting Crows' ""Colorblind"" is really really really good. Its a great preview for their next album!"
2,Westek 3 level touch pad.,"Electrically, the product is as advertised. However, we noticed that the pad has left an indelible mark on the cream colored cabinet. Not pleased."
3,Westek Touch Pad Dimmer,"Nice when it works. After an electrical storm the thing sort of got a mind of it's own. It randomly turned on the light in the middle of the night. At first I thought the cat was doing it, but I've seen the light go on without the cat being in sight. It worked great for about 8 or 9 months and controlled a halogen bulb.Edit 11-29-10. The second touch pad failed and won't work at all. It arrived 4-10-08 and stopped working 11-27-10 while changing a burned out bulb. It just made a pop when the bulb was screwed in. The things have a 5 year Warranty but by the time you pay to ship the old one back, and take the chance the claim will be denied, you can just buy a new one. Too bad they can't make these things last longer. They are really handy when they work."
1,Dies soon after purchase.,"Two people I know use these all the time, but I've gone through two that didn't last more than a couple months. The problem seems to occur when the bulb burns out. I had mine hooked up to a desk lamp and both times these things have crapped out, it's been right after the bulb burned out. :/ I guess all I can say is it MIGHT work for you."
1,small and slick unit but not funtion well!,I like the model of this unit but the poor quality of it just get on my nerve! This toy just turn off by itself while playing music. Very furstrated! Amazon wouldn't replace their bad product because they said it has passed the return period (within 30 days).
5,"Concise, Creative, Catchy","Amy Winehouse looks to the past to create something new. An album that could hold up in the 60s as it does today were the lyrics not resonant of a woman who is anything but traditional. Her vices, drinking and men, namely, account for most of the material, but the way she sings of them mark this album as original. Unapologetic for the wino in her, drained from the men in her, Winehouse sings in a voice bigger than her human foibles. And I am all too eager to listen."
2,Higly overrated,"Only three real good songs on this record, but we`ve heard them all before. This is nothing new, the entire record is kind of a Motown soul replica, and could easily have been made back in the early 70`s.Amy has a cool voice though, and the lyrics aren`t too bad, but the production quality is so unimaginably crappy you couldn`t believe it. The bass-sounds are boomy, there are distortions in Amy`s voice, and the arrangements all over are poor and monotonous. Because of this, I think it`s annoying to listen to this record. The crew responsible for this thrashy production, should have been punished.. Better luck next time!"
1,Ripping off real artists.,"Amy Winehouse is so freakin' ugly, how does she sell albums? A total druggie, alcoholic, and god how much does she weigh, 45 pounds? She is a terrible role model, she is just as bad as Lindsay Lohan. Winehouse can't sing, she thinks she is some rockin' soul singer from the 1960's but she isn't, she is just a wannabe. Take my advice and stay away from this over-rated album, but if you like to hear a troubled and pathetic woman whining about going to rehab which is where she is now, then this album should make you happy."
4,No Rehab gal,"Amy's voice has an Motown edge with a little Billie Holiday smoke. It is hard to picture a Jewish Londoner with these qualities, excluding Sacha Barron Cohen, of course. I really like her lyrics and style. I just wish she would replace the electronic backup drum machines and stuff with genuine solid blues/jazz type musicians behind her for her next performance."
5,I am so glad I bought this CD!,"Rollingstone directed me to first hear her Live on Youtube. I was impressed. The CD is GREAT! I bought the CD in a store, but was compelled to come here to write a review. I love her lyrics as much as her sound."
3,"Amy, fire your sound engineer!!This recoding is awful!!!","Decent record , worth examining I guess if you like her style. But the quality of sound mastering is terrible: Pumped bass and treble and nothing else. Not recommended for audiophiles."
1,Awful!,"Awful quality! I have all my original vinyl from the 70's and 80's. When I played this album I thought something was wrong with my needle, which is brand new. I took one of my old records out, played it, and it was fine. They just pressed this album very poorly. Save the $20 bucks...don't even bother."
5,Amy-excellent Cyndi Lauper's Bring Ya To The Brink,"Her cd is unique. Excellent and fresh music. No wonder Cyndi Lauper was thrilled when she announced Amy's the New Artist Grammy as a winner. Buy Cyndi's Bring ya To The Brink. Cyndi's new dance cd is coming out on May 28, 08. Her new single Set Your Heart is awesome. I would like to see Amy in Cyndi's True Colors Tour performing together."
5,I love it,"I absolutely adore this album. I am not too crazy about Amy Winehouse herself and her real-life rehab experiences but this album is just amazing. All the songs are so heart felt, so real, so full of emotion. I prefer some of the less popular songs to the ones that had huge commercial success."
5,What a voice!,"This is a great CD. I received it over a year ago and still listen to it. What makes this CD all the more interesting is the troubles that Amy is going through. When I first got the CD as a gift, I didn't know who she was or what she was about. But as soon as I heard the first few notes from her voice...WOW! She is incredible!Unfortunately, Amy is going through a lot of issues. When a singer goes through what she is, most people want to toss the CD aside and figure, ""yeah, I ripped it for my iPod, it'll go to craigslist soon."" But with this CD, you want to keep it. You want to listen to it; not for messages or any of that psychology stuff, but because it may truly be the last real recording she does. And even if it isn't, the music is fantastic. Don't ignore this, it's a classic sound brought into the modern day."
4,"Back to Black, ironic","Such a soulful voice, reminiscent of singers long gone, Amy delivers what seems to be an autobiography. She sings about being engulfed in dark moments, she is clearly stuck in a destructive lifestyle. Ironically, I had trouble finding this CD for a long time and ordered it from Amazon.com the week before she died. Such a great talent, such a train wreck. ""FRANK"" is just a good."
2,The Power of Emotion!,"This woman had an unusually cute face, a nice rack and some pretty tattooes; but other than that, and at best a fair performer...she had no singing talent whatsoever!"
4,Definately Worth the Hype,"I was very impressed. I heard songs from her first album, and i think she has really honed in on her skills. She has a very mixed sound. A little Patsy Kline, Jill Scott and Lauren Hill. She did not get a 5 star because of that horrible rap remix on track 11. That really sucked. Other than that she is great."
3,Something different for me.,"All in all this disk was something different for me. I heard ""You Know I'm No Good"" and I liked it so I picked up the disk and I have to say that it is pretty good. It's something new for me has an old school jazzy thing to it with a modern twist. Granted her lyrics may be a little weird but still it's good work."
5,An astonishing album of updated 60s soul/jazz,"Amy Winehouse sounds incredibly authentic as the Detroit-via-London chanteuse who infuses each song with 60s Shangri-Las doo-wop plus some jazz and blues. It's as if some time machine dropped on your CD player, pushed you back 40 years, and ten lost gems just tumbled out. However, the lyrics don't speak to bubblegum sensibilities -- heartache, relationship upheavals, and personal downfalls inhabit these songs. Amazing that she wrote or co-wrote all the songs. An incredible emotive talent with the perfect voice for this project. I did want to note that the tracks produced by Salaam Remi (ex: Me & Mr Jones) sound much cleaner than those produced by Mark Ronson (ex: ""Rehab"") who tries a bit too hard to recreate that mono-ish 60s wall of sound. This is not a high-fidelity release."
5,Don't sleep on this album!,"As much of a Christina Aguilera fan I am, Back to Black is the album she wished she'd recorded when planning the concept for her own throw-back inspired disc, Back to Basics. Where Christina's throw-back sound ended up a mish-mash of 50s and hip-hop with insipid lyrics on love and swagger and her trademark over-singing, Amy Winehouse, with the absolutely stellar producer Mark Ronson in tow, created an album that could have been sung by Aretha and Etta--had they written songs dealing with alcohol and drug use/abuse and f*cked up love affairs. Back to Black is that rare concept album that comes about once in a lifetime that sounds like its concept(60s soul/jazz/girl-groups) and yet remains current and relatable--and edgy. Couple Amy's blunt lyrics with the smoky, gritty quality of her voice as she allows it to dip and trill and scat(with the absence of over-singing), and Back to Black is an album I can declare to be the best of 2007 long before this year is over."
1,Absolutely TERRIBLE,"I don't get what all the fuss is, particularly now since Winehouse died. Fortunately I didn't buy this one, a friend loaned it to me. So glad I didn't! It's a complete ripoff of earlier artists and music, and not in a good way. Ms. Winehouse's voice would have been put to much better use if we could take out the do-wop rip-offs and replace them with unique blues songs. Could have been great, but completely misses the mark here."
3,The Day the Ronettes Cried,"I guess it wasn't just an ""act."" Too bad she really didn't go to rehab, or at least connect with a good mental health professional.Etta James went through something similar, but she managed to get her act together. One can only wonder what Amy was capable of had she put out another album. People keep calling her sound ""retro soul."" I disagree: I would call it wonderfully ""trashy pop"": she was like the bad Ronette, or perhaps the lead singer of a modern day Shangri-Las called The Shangri-Lows. What can one say about the drugs and alcohol? Every year or two some successful star burns out, and it's romanticized all over again.It's The Cliche That Never Dies."
1,I hope that you realize?,That everytime you buy this cd that you are helping support her drug habit which is another nail in her coffin. That is all~
4,Genuinely soulful,"From the opening track Rehab I knew this was going to be a great album. Winehouse has a genuinely soulful voice that expresses all the different moods of the genre. Besides Rehab, my favorite track is called Love Is A Losing Game, a gem of a song with a beautiful melody in the lost love tradition. Another great one is You Know I'm No Good with its powerful sax. And Me & Mr Jones is a stunner. The music gains a distinctive flavor through the use of samples from classic 1960s pop songs, while the lyrics are intelligent and mature. There is a certain authenticity to this seamless blend of funk, torch, R&B and pop grooves that reaches the heart and soul. It's rare to find an album these days where every single track is memorable; Back To Black has thus been a very pleasant surprise. Judging by this excellent CD, Winehouse will prove to be a major force in the years to come."
1,People really need to stop giving this album 5 star reviews.,"I cannot believe how low people's musical tastes have dropped over the past few years. This drivel is given over 100 5 star reviews!?!?!?! Are you serious!?!??! It isn't about how she compares with older R&B/soul divas (she doesn't) or how contrived and boring her lyrics are (Your going to rehab? congrats!!), the fact is that people like this album BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD TO."
1,Not What I Expected,"I was really disappointed with this CD. The lyrics were more profane than I expected. The songs felt repetitive and musically I felt they lacked any kind of payoff. If you like the single ""Rehab,"" just buy that. You can skip the whole disk unless you are looking for a good, nasty snooze."
4,"WTF happened to ""Addicted""?","Everybody knows this record is a 5 star album, but why did they take ""Addicted"" off of the US version? Anybody who wants the real 'Back To Black' should get the UK version. The Ghostface verse on ""You Know I'm No Good"" is kinda unnecessary, especially as a bonus track swapped out for ""Addicted""."
4,Amy Winehouse Rocks the House!,"What a great CD, it's so different than other rock/blues music, she adds horns to give you that throw-back sound to earlier jazz and blues music. I really like ""rehab"" and ""back to black""."
5,Nicholas and Alexander,I found the price reasonable. I enjoyed reading about the russians in that century. The story was an opening of people in another era. What a wonderful experience!
2,101 excuses for a failed Tsar,"Although well researched and rich in insights into the Romanovs' family life, the book is rather one-sided in its pursuit of the Tsar's rehabilitation in the eyes of history. Massie jumps out of his skin trying to find excuses for all the blunders the Tsar and the Tsarina are commonly blamed for, from the Japanese war, to the Bloody Sunday, to Rasputin. Yes, they were mere humans, and a loving family, but they had a JOB to do, and that was to rule Russia at one of the most critical point in that country's history, and they mostly failed at it. Unfortunately, the author attempts to convince us that the Romanovs were purely victims of tragic circumstance. While this may be said about many historical figures, this is not what I was interested in when I bought this book."
4,Apologist for aristocracy,"Although well researched and thorough (from the viewpoint of the autocrat,) Massey shows little compassion for the plight of the peasant or soldier. He makes it seem almost as though the fall of the monarchy was primarily due to Rasputin and hemophilia, rather than the disastrous consequences of WW1 and centuries of autocratic rule. Romantic and apologetic. But a pleasant and informative read."
2,Meh...,I wore these 2 times & one of the heels started peeling from the rest of it. A lady complimented them but noted that the same thing happened to her. This company was nice enough to refund me my money when I let them know what happened.
2,Save your money,"I bought this stove for atmosphere and for heat. It came with one broken foot and after waiting 30 minutes for a customer service rep I hung up. After 3 months the heater now does not work. What now? Yea, I suppose it has one of the more ""realistic"" fake flames but even when the heater did work, it put out very little heat for 1500W. My suggestion is go to your local home center and buy one there (probably for less) if it has an issue I would guess you could take it back for refund or replacement. I gave it 2 stars (generously) because of the lovely flame. I would not recommend however."
4,Great Decorative Piece but Fair Heat Source,"I bought this product to heat a 700 sq ft. master suite in my day-light basement. I live in East Tennessee mountain area and winters are mild compared to a big part of the country. However, we get down into the teens many nights during winter. I used this as a secondary heat source with the primary source being Central Heat and Air. This product will take the chill out of the air and provides warmth if you are sitting close. I like the fact that it is cool to touch as well which is great for children and pets. It's definitely attractive and has a romantically realistic flame."
3,Not a juicy romance,"I've read a few of Anna DeStefano's books. I really enjoy her writing style, so I had high hopes for this book. But I really wanted a juicy romance (this book is a Harlequin SuperRomance), and it just wasn't there. Plenty of drama, drama, drama. Everyone's got lots of issues that make for interesting reading. If you're looking for a juicy romance, though, look elsewhere."
1,useless pump,"No, ZERO STARS. This is a non-functioning bike pump. I'm about to start looking for my receipt. You basically have to break your finger off to set the valve lever, and then it doesn't let you push down. I tried it on 4 other tires and only managed to get some air in 1. Unbelievable."
3,Ho-Hum,"I agree with most of the other reviews. This book while it does start true to the original Flix/Pip forumla nothing of real content is divalged. It is good for what it is but nothing comes of it.My impression-I liked this book, but like I said nothing really happened. You should read it if you are a big fan of this serise however."
3,I don't like it.,"First off it is a pain to be getting your electric out when the acoustic is in. You are always worried about banging up your guitars. You have to put them in and take them out very slowly. Second, you cannot set an electric with a chord that inserts on bottom in without the chord hitting the floor, which will eventually mess it up. But it is made well. Maybe if the acoustic were on back and the stand was a little higher I'd keep it but for now it's gonna have to go."
5,Excellent product!,"What they don't tell you is that it also works well for an acoustic guitar and a banjo. Folds up, light weight... perfict."
1,Newsflash,"I love reading reviews of books I've read (I hardly review myself but I made an exeption in this case). All the people that gave this book a good review have only ever reviewed this book (despite being avid readers). Or if they reviewed any other book, like say Harry Potter, they somehow manage to write about ""dope"" and how great it is and how people should go read it. But they hardly write about the book they're supposed to be reviewing. Now it doesn't take a genious to figure out all these reviews are fake and written by either the author or his friends. And that's why I'm writing this review. I brought this book because it got great reviews only to find the book horrible and the reviews fake. This book doesn't go over anyones head. It's just a horrible book. DO NOT BUY THIS ATTEMP AT LITERATURE!"
1,Mr. Escandon YOUR a terrible writer.,"Not that I consider myself a grammar nazi (for if I was I wouldn't be making such terrible grammar mistakes), or someone who enjoys a good book or rather someone who knows the difference between a good book and a bad book, but I for one do not believe in Dope. I can't see how a human being can say that this very adorable attempt to an undeveloped idea can stand against the works of Salinger, Thompson and others.Mr. Escandon's childish expression to deliver his frustration of the world is as cute as a kindergardener coloring outside the lines, or writing his/her name with a crayon and getting all the letters wrong.Can't say I recommend this thing."
4,Wow,"I bought this book last night.WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm only on chapter 4, but i can't put this book down.Dope is the best book I've read this far, funny, playful and very very deep. Buy it if you want something to think about."
5,It's hard to over-rate the Kyser Capo,"""Capo"" is Latin for ""head"" - it's mighty handy to change your guitar's ""head!"" This little clip-on wonder is the world standard, and the price is right. Thanks, Kyser."
5,Awesome!,"This Capo is a must for any guy. Many double takes on this item, as well as were we got it. Amazon sent it pronto, which helped because I couldn't find this product in any of the guitar store were I live."
5,best capo I've used,"I've had one of these for years and it's still going strong. Easy to get on and off, which is nice if you're performing or just don't feel like dealing with one of the old school capos that comes apart and needs 2-3 things done for it to work. If speed and ease are what you're looking for, this is the capo to get. Works great for both acoustic and electric guitars."
4,Now I have two,I already had one of these capos and decided to buy another for my other guitar. It's the only one I have tried and it works just fine for me.
3,Good Capo,"This capo works just fine and I have no issues with it other than when I first saw this product it was shown as red, white and blue but not like the flags shown now. It was solid colors on different parts of the capo and looked awesome. When I got this I was a little dissappointed by its appearance bec it made my guitar look like it belonged to some country bumpkin. Works great though...I just painted over it."
5,super duper,"Capo feels solid and durable, has performed well so far. Bought it for my sister and she loves it. Easy to move, especially once you get the feel for it. Would buy again :)"
3,Convinced!,"I had always believed that we landed men on the Moon. I had heard bits n' pieces, rumors about a simulation of this historic date in our TimeLine and basically brushed aside the notion of any fakery involved.I ordered the book, ""We Never....."" and then my mind started to see what my eyes refused to. The points that I think make this event suspicious to me now are the 6 near perfect ""trips"" to the Moon; the astronauts entering the unfilterd sunlight areas, temperatures that their suits would not allow them to survive; deaths of people involved with the 'mission' that perhaps were a threat to the success of the secret. If it wasn't faked, then the Government would have all the information at it fingertips to disprove the theory and put the disbelievers to rest........?? Where is the proof and why to this day are we not using the Moon as a practical base for space operations. Until I hear something to change my mind I'm leaning towards a simulation.........."
2,Unconvincing,"When I realised I'd dropped $15 for this I could have wept. I want to believe in conspiracy theories however books like this do not help the cause.It's a thin tome to begin with; in addition, a number of the pages are taken up entirely with (often irrelevant) photographs, looking as it they've been taken on some ancient old busted camera and photocopied a dozen times.This is an interesting topic however this book in no way does it justice. Purchase something else for your money."
3,Rate this book Honestly,"Well, the first thing i noticed in the review here and at bn.com about this book is, many people are rating this book as 1star because they do not want to believe that the moon landing was a hoax. I am not saying it is a hoax, nor am i saying its not a hoax but if you are interested on this subject you should read it. people should not rate it on their beliefs."
4,solid set of soul,"Perhaps nothing earthshaking or life changing to be found on here, but it's a solid set. On this CD you will find some very good 70s soul music with brilliant harmonies and a happy vibe. I never get tired of listening to music from this era. As another reviewer noted, the Friends of Distinction were more than one-hit wonders and had plenty of fine songs. This CD gives a good overview of their best material."
5,eye of the tiger,"very good response and delivery time. Well packaged and excellent condition.very good sound. Brings back some good memories of when it first came out. Have it in my house collection and also garage collection, great to get in the mood to work on race car."
3,Classic Few Hits Wonder of the early Eighties,"When I was just a teenager this album first came out, I was hooked on it then. a little while ago I found the CD version of this and got hooked again. Not the most classic music, but typical of the early eighties bands."
4,Plastic trash bin,"This sits perfectly between the seat and drinks tray in my Dodge RAM 1500. It is a trash can, it does exactly what it says it should on the box!"
5,I love this tape :-) these songs are great,If anyone has the CD and wants to sell it to me please contact me at abrookhart@yahoo.com thanks Angie
4,the Bucket list,The Bucket List [Blu-ray]I really enjoyed this movie the picture is so neat and clear the audio is clear as well
1,"It's not funny, it's sad",This was a horrible movie. It wasn't funny at all and both the guys die of cancer at the end. I give it 1.5 stars cause at least it had good actors in it.
4,A thoughtful comedy,"Comedy works best when there's a grain of truth to it, and when it's provocative. We get both here. Taking on the topics of cancer and death isn't easy under any circumstances, let along trying to make a compelling movie out of them.And yet, that's what we have here. A serious and lighthearted film all rolled into one! Yes, that's what it is. A journey of discovery, and of coming to terms with death and the measure of one's life.And like life, we get both laughter and tears.Well done!"
5,Watched on plane while going to Alaska,"My husband and I watched this movie on the plane as we were going to Alaska. We thought it would be a good diversion. We are both big Jack Nicholson fans. Of course, the little screens and the noise of the plane do not always allow you to get all of the dialogue and nuances but overall we loved it. I am going to buy the DVD so I can pickup what we missed. I agree with those who did not like not using the historic places like the Taj Mahal,etc. I think they could have shown those. However, that being said, it was an entertaining, 1 box of tissues movie."
4,Good movie- Sad but funny too!,This is a good movie - I like Nicholson and Freeman together. It is sad in alot of ways - deep in meaning - but it is a good movie at the ending for what it is and for what it is about. There is comedy in most of this - but it is a deep movie all the same. I liked it - bought it for my mother.
3,A good but not great movie,"After reading other reviews, I went to the theater. Jack Nicholson was his usual self, sometimes streaching the boundaries of credulity - especially with a manic-depressive persona. Morgan Freeman is a very good actor and turns in a respectable, if predictable performance. One star was taken away for using stock footage of famous places. eg The scene in Africa with wildabeast crossing a river is a favorite of tourists with cameras. The one in Egypt was also hard on the eyes. The other star deduction was for the inability of the director/editor to make the story flow.While I actually enjoyed the story line, the movie never made it to where I was able to suspend my disbelief and become involved with the characters. It could have been a great film, if all the people working on it had spent a little more time making the movie instead of rushing it into the theaters.Unfortunately, because of the flaws, the DVD is not one I would buy and keep."
2,H'wood Strikes Again,"Yet another example of Hollywood's lack of imagination. This time a remake without the decency to credit the original. Shame on you Mr. Reiner, you're better than that. Bucker List is a good formula movie with seasoned A-listers. Not as good or believable as the low budget original. If you liked Bucket List try the movie they stole from: Hawks (1988)"
5,Life Lessons!,"This movie has every element in it that I look for: life lessons, family, self discovery, romantic moments, unlikely friendship, adventure, and acceptance of things in life that we don't want to accept. I emphatically recommend that you watch this movie!"
3,"Interesting, sad, yet worth watching!","This was a good movie. Worth the $3.99 rental fee. Some parts hit me pretty hard, and I was tearing (rhymes with steering) up. This from a GUY!Other parts dragged on, but it wasn't boring. Interesting movie, and two excellent actors. Made me think about my life, mostly, and what I'm doing wrong, or could change. I suppose that was the whole purpose of the movie, maybe?Anyway, I enjoyed it, definitely worth renting. Great performances, could have had a deeper plot though.And I have to mention, the video quality was excellent, didn't notice any hiccups in the playing of the movie. Amazon has done a great job. And I didn't have to spend any money on gas to rent this movie (a definite plus!)."
4,Great Film if you are in the market for sentimental and funny,"I actually purchased this for my dad for father's day. He LOVED it. I watched it as well and I thought it was really good. The movie is more sentimental than funny. It was also somewhat predictable, but the writing was great and the ""chemistry"" between Nicholas and Freeman was fantastic. Another pleasant surprise was the guy who played Jack on Will & Grace had a decent part in this movie and he played it well. (I was not a huge fan of his before this movie.) I would recommend this if you like sentimental movies with some humor thrown in.P.S. One of my friends said that she hated this movie and expected it to be funnier. My response to that is, it is a movie about death, not a dumb and dumber for the elder generation. If you are looking for belly laughs this is not the movie for you."

2,flatliner,"The only thing that redeems this dull, predictable flatliner of a film is the cast. Freeman and Nicholson could read aloud from the phone book and make it interesting, and in this case they have to."
1,One of 2007's Worst Films,"Plagued with post-production difficulties (evident in its truncated 97-minute length), ""The Bucket List"" managed to rake in $175 million worldwide. However, Rob Reiner's directorial skill deserves something more substantial than this manipulative piece of schmaltz. The film's selling point is the first-time pairing of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately, the Oscar winners display little chemistry in their scenes together. Nicholson overacts in desperation to keep the shuck and jive afloat, but ""The Bucket List"" is dead on arrival."
3,Slim Shady.........got that right!!!!!!,"From the samples the CD is ok. Slim shady would be the best song to me so far. Artist voice get's a little annoying after a while. Hard to believe that Dre. had something to do with this after Snoop Dog, and Rage and the Chronic Cd the all time best. There is a lot of originality in the CD but the beats could have been better.Three stars for originality and..The song ""Slim Shady""."
5,Why are there so many racists writing reviews?,"If a black rapper comes out with a bad CD it's because he can't flow or the beats are horrible. If a white rapper comes out with a cd YOU think is bad it's because he's white. That's racist. Some reviews are racist and ignorant, I just have to laugh when I read them. Yall go back to school and learn how to not judge people because of their skin. Plus, this CD is TIGHT! However, if you dislike it, fine I can respect that, however it's not BECAUSE he's white."
3,What's goin' on?,"This CD is the weirdest one I have ever heard, but I don't know if thats good or bad?"
4,Great Album,"I generally do not like rap very much, but this cd is awesome. I don't care that he is white, he could be purple for all I care. Regardless of the man's color, much of what he says is right about the music industry and life in general. If you want to listen to something with some intelligence, listen to this. Dan."
5,Funny CD,"This isn't really a CD to take seriously. It will definatley make you laugh. And if your drunk and stoned, it will make you ball. And it also thumps really well with my Quadrupple 18' inch subwoofers. Gotta have this one."
1,crapper,"rapper, rhymes with crapper where this worthless, unmusical, garbage needs to be. Do yourself a favor and dont buy garbage like this no talent,nonsinging, egotistical maniac so called musician"
1,I have a guilty conscience for listening to this,"Another rapper poisons the radio waves, leaving behind only obscene and distasteful lyrics. I can curse too. And I'm white. So where's my record contract?"
1,It takes no talent to rant profanely.....,How can you call it talent or the art when the lyrics sound just like I do when I'm having a fight with wife?
4,"Not Bad, its pretty damn good actually","I really can't stand Eminem, but this CD is pretty damn good. I'm really impressed with Eminem's flow and rap ability. Some of the songs are rather repetitive, but songs like ""Stan"", ""Marshall Mathers"", and ""The Way I am"", rock."
1,BEST SUMMARY OF EMINEM EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,eminem is the most disgusting artist i have ever heard. his music simply serves as a means of desensitizing the youth to the horrors of reality. any one who buys this and has an appreciation for the music does not understand the meaning of being human. and so what if he is a white guy?
3,Ems 1st album,This is Ok. All the songs up to and including Track 9 Role Model except the skit B*tch R good or great but after Role Model every track and skit were rubbish except Still Dont Give A F**k! So its you're choice ethier buy for Tracks 1 to 9 and Track 20 or leave it.
3,Just to Entertain.,"Eminem is a lot better now, than he was then. This album is not sorry it's just that most of the songs on this album sound too much the same. There are some songs I do like listening to but over all I think the album should get a 3 out of 5."
4,Demented but great,"This CD is defenitly not for kids. It's violent, and drug oriented, and hilarius at the same time. It's also much better than the ""Marshal Mathers LP"". The reason I only gave it a four stars is becuase it has a lot of negativity in it. Even though he talks about killing his wife in ""97' bonie and clide"" you can hardly take any of it seriusly. The one I can't stand is ""Still don't give a f__k"". The violence in it is outrageous. Parents beware....."
1,M y name is down the drain,This is the worst cd i have ever listened too. I have two words to summarize it all. It is pooh pooh. The lyrics are great but the music sucks. He sounds like a martian when he sings. This cd is just the poopiest cd i have ever heard.
4,His Best,"This is definitly Eminem's best album. This is Eminem before he became the hottest rapper on Earth, when he was a lot more funny and creative. There are only like 3 songs that I don't like. The beats are just ok, but he makes up for it with his witty lyrics and tight flow. If you're into rap, you'll like it."
2,disappointing album for a talent rapper,"As an Eminem fan and fan of rap in general, this was quite a disappointment. (Perhaps, because I bought it after the other two and had high expectations.) This cd lacked any real showcase for his talent. The beats are somewhat deccent but the juvenille ryhmes are pretty pathetic compared to him today. Although, the overall album was pretty annoying and- for lack of a better word- crap, a few songs I liked, such as Rock Bottom and Still Don't Give A F**ck (which were some of the better tracks and are reminesent of the insightful and careless views found on Eminem's other two albums.) Bottom line: Fair Effort for a 1st run but definately not worth the money, unless your a fan who wants to own everything his ever done."
3,Its alright,THIS CD WAS DECENT NOT DA BOMB OR EVEN GREAT JUST OK.I WOULD NOT CONSIDER THIS AMOUNG THE THOUSAND GREATEST RAP CD'S EVER. Don't waste your money on this!
3,WEAK WEAK WEAK!!!!!!!,I think the song my name is... is rather silly .I think Dre could have found a little better talent.I hope the next single sounds better
5,CLASSiC.,"dr. dre sure found some talent here. great production, rhymes, grooves.. who cares if someone is black, white, red, yellow, green, whatever.. it don't matter people.. this kid has an original approach, check more than the ""my name is"" to see it in full force."
3,this album aint that great....believe that hommies..and im an eminem fan,"only two or three songs are greatif a rap song cant be played in the club (while strippers are getting their freak on) OR it doesnt have INTELLIGENT lyrics like that of TUPAC, BIGGIE, MOS DEF, KANYE, COMMON SENSE.....it AINT MUSICya dig?!"
1,Anyone Listening?,"Dear All,This man is awful! He is against every person in this world, and I don't have this cd, but i know someone that does and they regret every cent the spent on his cd! His cd's are full of swearing and hate! Our country doesn't need more hate - we have enough! so save your pennies and buy something else - anything else!"
4,it's about time . . .,"you know, I REALLY didn't think that white boys could even touch rap, but eminem took what the bloodhound gang did and made it better! big props to him, and i'll be looking for another cd soon . . . and by the way, he really IS fine!"
5,"SLIM SHADY AND DA D.R.E,THE ALBUM WAS CRAZY","THIS ALBUM WAS TIGHT.AT FIRST I DIDN'T LIKE HIM,UNTIL I HEARD THE TRACK #3.BUT THE WHOLE ALBUM IS STRAIGHT.I'M FEELING EVERY THING THAT HEIS SAYING.THIS WHITE BOY CAN RAP!"
3,"Don't let a lousy track like ""My Name Is"" fool you.","This cd is good. After hearing ""My Name Is,"" I wasn't expecting much. After listening to the whole thing, I decided I liked it. The production is tight, and so is the concept. The lyrics are amazing. There are a few lousy tracks, but a bunch of the other ones are great."
4,"This isnt Rap, its a comedy album","Got this CD, skipped ""My name is"" and was laughing all the way.....Now I hope that people dont do the political/color thing and I suspect that it has, and if you go there then the jokes on you...You been had; not by a ""white wuss waper"" but by a comedian who is goofin on himself and you."
4,Good,I grew up with rap. This is a CD I am now begging for. He is one of the best White rappers. This is a fairly good CD.
1,"Dumb(But what do you expect,it's Hip-Hop)","It's sad to see a man like Kurt Loder,who I presume has a Doctorate in journalism,sit and laugh at this subhuman's vacant humor and stupid answers.So okay,it's just another vulger, hedonistic,poorly written piece of trash,in other words typical Hip-Hop.This album will only serve to placate anthropoids who think""Dem white boys can't rap"" but who cares?We should have jettisoned these apes when we had the chance a century ago.Oh yeah,all that electronic junk(sounds like Rice Krispies to me)buries enjoyment for me."
1,What's the Point??,"I just don't get it...does the world really need another angst rapper...if you can even call him that. This kid has nothing good to say about anyone, so why bother...kids don't need this kind of input and influence these days. It's worthless to waste more time and space here..."
5,Eminem the best rapper,"Eminem style is just phenomenol, his lyrics are phat, and very comical, but also violent and explicit. He makes you think about life and makes you realize what he is been to. He pushes freedom of speech to the limit, and all the tracks are great. He does a good job with the skits to introduce the next song. Check out ""Guilty Conscience"" the the best song in the album. Also check out his next album ""The Marshall Mathers"" which is even funnier and more violent and he gets more personal."
1,Utter Crap,"This CD friggin stinks, its all about murders, rapes, violence, drugs, the same friggin thing on every friggin song. I can't firgure this moron out, his about the most negative person i've ever encountered. Any talent he actually has is drowned by his stories of hate and crime. Why does stuff like this even exist and the thing is rap was once a valid genre, if you think this purverted garbage is what rap initially was all about than your sadly mistaken."
1,What have we come to?,"This CD is an extradinary and unmatch display of barbarity, and what's even more shocking is that people like it that way! How can this be called music? It shouldn't be anywhere near the music category! Come on, people. Don't you have anything better to listen to?"
1,What hell is this?,"Anyone who purchases this CD should be examined by a clinical psychoanalyst. I have two words to summarize it all. It is f*cking sh*t, "" my name is "" has to be the most annoying song of all time in the rap game."
5,This cd is the best cd in the world. EMINEM KICKS A$$!!!!!!!,"Hey whats up?I think Eminem is the best rapper. His lyrics are hilarious and screwed up, but thats what i like about them. They make me happy when im pissed and another reason i like it is because it makes my parents all pissed off when i listen to it. so know im going to buy his edited cd so i can listen to his other songs edited and im going to get every single, cd, movie, music video, anything on him. I am eminems biggest fan. i have a 300 page notebook on him and a collage of picas i got off the net covering my wall"
1,THIS ARTIST DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO RAP,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. SLIM SHADY DOES NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD RAP. HE NEEDS TO BE FIRED AND TAKEN OFF THE AIR WAVES.
1,WHITE MEN CAN JUMP BUT THEY SURE CANT RAP,"This is, without a doubt, the worst cd ever. Eminem's voice is incredibly annoying, his lyrics are horrible, and the beats are wack. Also his video for ""My name is..."" is the absolute worst music video I have ever seen. Eminem is everywhere now and I dont see why. Save your $ everyone...Get a cd that is NOT a disgrace to rap or hip hop.(i.e. 2pac, Wutang, etc.) Dont buy this ""cd"" cuz u think its funny. Dont buy this cd for any reason. The last thing the world needed was another Vanilla Ice, and, I'm sorry 2 say, we got one. This cd does not deserve a tip of a star."
5,"awesome,funny as crap cd!!!","this dd is awesome!!! it is the funnyist cd besides marshall mathers. ken kaniff is as funny as crap!!! eminem is awesome!!! i dont know why everyone dosent like him!!! buy this cd,well review it first if you arent into the cussing,but it just makes it funnier! i always listen to this cd! no one can get funnier than eminem!!!"
3,"If you like rap with a lot of swearing, this is for you!","I think that this is a great CD but there is a lot of profanity and great swear workds. But if you like that kind of thing, go for it! It is a great deal with a lot of songs and a lot of variety!!!"
1,I am totally appalled,"Although I've only heard one song by Eminem, it's obvious to me that this guy has little or no talent.. What is with this guy? His voice is definitely too high pitched and squeaky to rap. This has to be the WORST thing I've heard in a very long time... this is even worse than Hanson (if that's possible).. I am so disgusted that anyone could give this anything more than 2 stars. I don't think this is even worthy of one star, but that's the lowest rating... I have one question: Why is this guy so popular?"
5,Great first book,"School psychologist, Skye Denison, is an amateur sleuth who had to leave her last school and has come back to her hometown of Scumble River, Illinois, where she swore she'd never return. Many people in town remember her high school graduation speech in which she did not talk nice about the town.I enjoyed this cozy and cannot wait to read more. The sleuth is likeable and the story moves quickly but she doesn't omit important items. There aren't so many characters that you lose track of who people are. She gets into a few sticky places (don't all amateur sleuths). It is a fun, quick read and I highly recommend it."
4,Skiing,I wore this for the first time last week as a replacement to a cotton turtle neck that I always wear skiing. This is much lighter and won't soak up the sweat like cotton.
2,"Looking for More Story, Less History","I suppose fans of ""worldbuilding"" would likely enjoy this one, but I fell out of the story somewhere during the interminably long and soporific thousand-year history of the protagonist's family's ancient grudge against the antagonist, early in the book, and never fell back in. I was looking for more story, less history."
4,good but not for the layman,"This book was good and very useful for research but a trite hard to understand. Overall I found it worth the read, and it has a very nice calendar of the festivals of Athens."
1,not made for men,this has the smallest seat cut out ever! if you are a male its impossible to sit down and go number 1 you will end up going on the floor. its nice and sturdy and came already assembled and you can adjust the legs to fit over your toilet but like i said it only works for women or going number 2. i like that it came pre assembled but we end up not using it because my dad couldnt use it.
3,An accurate description of one man's year in Vietnam,"Gordon Steinbrook uses old letters written home to recall the day to day events of his year in Vietnam. Steinbrook has one of the truly unique experiences of the war, serving with both US and Australian forces primarily as a forward observer and fire direction officer in artillery. Although his account does not include much 'combat', it does, none the less, give one a true picture of the way it was for many of us. ..""long periods of extreme boredom punctuated by short intervals of extreme 'urgency'"". I can personally testify to the accuracy of this work."
1,I don't recommend.,"In my opinion this book really shows its age. For example, there are long sections about the Oedipus Complex, which no one seems to talk about anymore except in a discussion of the anacronisms of Freud. The book takes a very psychological point of view overall. I agree with the other negative reviewer who said it rambles. Probably the best parts are when the author encourages parents to provide appropriate but firm discipline, but I've heard that many times before."
4,Great for new parents,"I initially read this book many years ago in a college Child Development class. While it is NOT a text book, it was very effective in helping to look into the mind of a child. I read it again when my daughter was young and it proved to be essential in helping get through some difficult situations. I purchased it again as a gift for some friends who are parents of an almost three year old. I know they'll get some help from it as well. Essentially, it helps to understand that small children's minds don't work as ours do, and what solutions can be most effective during times of night terrors and such. It's a practical book to meet the challenges of practical parenting."
4,Great Entertainment for Nostalgia Fans!,"I am finding that many, MANY younger people are showing a growing respect, appreciation and true ENJOYMENT of our older black & white movies. They are truly refreshing, in that, there is a STORY line: RESPECT to a degree for the clergy: and ESPECIALLY a terrific freedom from only mandatory suck face capades and sleep-around-athons non stop that bombard us today. This film is humorous, thrilling and INTELLIGENTLY done! Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. was a natural athlete who made his Zorro charming, heroic and again very lightheartedly funny. I suppose the best way to describe the experience in enjoying this film is the sense of innocence. Yes, there were cruel and unusual occurrences yesteryear, however, if there was a way to calm the anger, the nerves and to escape into a pleasant distraction, this film is for you."
5,Hot Item!^^,I loved this item. It was exactly as discribed. The shipping was great and it came in excellent condition. If you like a good book this one is a great mistery/suspence/werewolf book that I have ever read. Once you start reading this one you can't stop until the end.
4,GREAT Wah,"The ability to quickly change the range and sensitivity has made it easy to dial in the exact sound you want to hear. It's built like a tank and has worked flawlessly in the time I've had it. Since I normally power it with a wall wart, I don't have much of an opinion about battery life.Bottom Line: It costs a bit more than the standard Dunlop wah pedals, it's worth it."
3,Item damaged,The wah effect is not working. When I press the pedal its only increasing and decreasing the volume. I will try to return the item
3,Chessy but good,"I don't know, I kinda liked it. So far Terminator franchise has peaked my curiosity. I just don't like the look of this movie. They could have done better with CGI or whatever they call it nowadays."
4,Deed I do love Diane Schuur.,"I have had this cd for many years and still love it. Excellent, timeless classic for any jazz enthusiast."
3,Viking Fan,"A little on the ""house use"" side. Not intended to fall on the ground or play with the neighborhood boys."
4,Finally something for the younger player,"I bought this toy for my 4 year old son's birthday. My Five 1/2 year old loved it and immediately picked it up. It was just challenging enough for my 4 year old to learn without being too hard that it is frustraing. Frequently, games designed for this age -be it computer or for the TV are too difficult for their stage of development to learn. This wasn't. My son liked the way the device vibrates and the tools light up to reinforce which one to use. I do wish there were a way to adjust the difficulty for my older children, but for a 3-6 year old this is the perfect ""driving"" toy. It allows them to be succesfull and challenges their hand eye coordination as well."
2,"Deceptive Description, Pricing and Shipping (But I got a Refund)","The product is fine. But the description is misleading. Each package contains ""40 count,"" that is, 40 filters. But this is not a ""(Pack of 12),"" as you would think from the description, from the price reduction (from $23.88 to $1.93), and from the shipping weight (4.20 lbs). It's just one box of 40 filters. And you'll pay, as I did, $11 for FedEx to bring you this one box.Soon after I submitted this feedback, I was issued a partial refund of $7. Product description still needs correcting, but at least customer service was responsive."
4,great book for a great price!!!,"This book rocks! and amazon is awesome for selling it for 61 cents! but for real, i needed this book for class and everyone was spending $60-70 dollars for it and i was able to find an older edition for real cheap! awesome!"
3,"Great machine, but be sure to budget an extra $80 for a different handle","This is a terrific machine. It's still work to use it, but it's so much more satisfying to use this instead of just elbow grease.However, the handle requires you to continuously hold down a button to keep the machine on, and it's torture. It's a terrible design, and it's not the same handle they send you if you rent the machine. The company will tell you there's nothing they can do but sell you an alternate handle for $80.It's a major disappointment to spend so much money, then be required to spend even more.Be warned."
5,No longer a secret,Making money from photography is everyones dream but a tough goal in reality. This book has helped me define my goals for marketing my photography. As an amateur turning pro this book has been a life saver. Bourne clearly and concisely outlines a variety of methods to market your work. The beauty of the book lies in it's set up. You can pick and choose what you want to use and attack each new obstacle one step at a time. I highly recommend 88 Secrets to anyone interested in turning their dream into a profitable business.
4,Wow,"As soon as I bought this album, I plugged it into my car stereo. When the first track came on, I swore that I was listening to Bonnie Raitt. This girl is a dead-sexy singer with a tight band.This album is just what I needed!"
3,Easy Read,"An easy to read book on cryptography and security. Stallings illustrates concepts well, with lots of examples. If you're after mathematical depth, this book is not for you. This book is more about high level ideas and concepts."
2,Interesting Book,"I found the material mostly interesting if not occassionaly difficult to read. However, I found it infurating that the review questions and problems asked at the end of the chapters, could not be answered based on the materials in the chapters.Nothing like setting you up for a fall. This isn't unique to this book, it seems a trend in most text books these days. It reflects poorly on the material, the publisher, and the author. You'd think an instructional book, would endeavor to provide its students with the tools necessary to answer the questions asked, instead of asking questions that the material doesn't cover.Really piss poor."
1,Very disappointing!!!!,"I bought this book for my 5 year old daughter hoping it would help with the bully issue, but after reading it, I hid it. I showed the book to three other adults who also thought it was somewhat frightening and depressing for a child. An adult might think the book is somewhat humorous as to how a child labels people who set limits, babies who pull hair, teachers who correct homework etc. all as being mean. A child sees this book as justification that mom is mean if she makes me eat vegetables. It seems to say to the child that everyone in the whole world is mean. A somewhat pessimistic and dark look at humanity. Not cool for kids! Save your money!!!(...)"
4,Learning Italian,"An effective method of supplementing your Italian lessons. The English translation allows speedy cross referencing without interrupting fluency. Learning new words by context is effective, and this format of narrative allows that."
2,A Disappointment,"I bought this book based on the great reviews here but was disappointed. While being concise about what is fun to do, see, etc., the author unfortunately feels the need to write comments in a sarcastic manner that almost put me off the entire place!I've noticed this with other Frommer's guides - watch out for the one on the Bahamas. After reading that book I asked myself why anyone would ever want to visit the place.Although it's nice to get honest opinions about a vacation destination, who wants to read something that essentially makes you feel like not going there?I recommend ""The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World"" instead. Although honest in their reviews, they're much more concise, complete, and positive about Disney.After all, I buy guide books because I'm already planning on visiting the place, not to make me decide not to go there!"
4,Average mold kit,Nothing special about the kit. Works as stated. Not the best mold kit I have used but it does the job.
5,This is VOLTAIRE!,"I love ""Zombie Prostitute"", it is Voltaire pure and simple. If you are not a fan, you may not appreciate his messed-up slightly disturbing lyrics. If you are a fan, then you will enjoy it even more!"
2,lions uniform,My son is a size 10 and this was a little too small in the pants. He wouldn't let me send it back.
3,Just Okay!,"This movie had a bit of trouble holding my interest! I did not dislike it and it was not a bad movie, just not my favorite. It is funny and I love Mickey Rooney..."
1,Awful!,Turned it off after about 10 minutes. No Christmas movie should EVER have the F-bomb in it especially one this horrible. That's 10 minutes I'll never get back.
1,Worst Chrstmas Movie of All Time,I have seen Jr. High Students give better performances than this..I never knew Mickey Rooney could be so bad...I want to meet the salesman who sold this turkey to some stupid producer...Turned it off after 45 minutes and broke it in two....
3,A tad dissapointed,"I was really looking forward to Brian's latest disc, but was overall disappointed when I listen through its entirety. It just did not seem fun, like many of his previous albums. The songs seemed rather tired, and they tend to start sounding the same near the end of the record. I see he has a new BSO album coming out, so I hope that offering will be much better than this...at least I would hope. For those who are new to Brian's work, I would suggest his ""Comeback Special"" which was excellent, or one of his early BSO project albums, such as ""Guitar Slinger""."
4,Enjoyable Read,"I enjoy the Hamish Macbeth series and this is one of the better ones. There are lots of mysteries for Hamish to solve including an insurance fraud and a missing boy. There is a budding romance with a 92 year old woman and a reformed criminal. Most mysterious of all is what is happening in the village of Stoyre. Hamish also is starting with the free spirit news reporter, Elspeth. A wonderful way to spend a couple of hours."
1,The worst purchase I have ever made.,"I ordered this great Item and what I got was a Item that was a bright ""PINK"". This does not work for me as I am a guy going on vacation from Iraq. I was going to were this to go see a girlfriend that is into Butterflies... she is not into men dressed in bright pink little girl looking things. I advise everyone not to buy anything from this seller."
1,No Help,This book was not helpful at all. Maybe we arent dummies. What we have learned has been not found in any books we have bought.
1,save your money,"Save your money!!! I would rate this less than one star if I could. Useless, silly, run of the mill information."
5,Best Poodle Book,This book was loaded with information from A TO Z on caring for your Poodle. I really learned a lot from this small book. You will see both colored and black and white photos explaining what your Poodle will need and want. Fantastic book for the money.
3,nuthing beats the original!,The album edit is the standout as the remixes string along towards monotony. Do yourself a favor and stick to D&D from the erotica album
1,"Don't Buy it, not one of her better Singles","Don't Get me wrong Deeper and Deeper is a great song, but the Remixes on this single are awful. By the time I got to the 4th track I was ready to send it back. It's not a bad song, the best tracks are 1 and 4 the rest totally stinks. Not her best single im afraid, definitely not worth the money."
2,not the ticket,Unfortunately this does not make me laugh. My young children didn't laugh either. Maybe I'm not old enough and the generation gap is too big for this footage to work for me (I'm 41 years old). The footage is very old- most jokes filmed from the black and white tv era. Maybe my father (who's 72) will laugh. I'll have to stick with utube hidden camera clips.
5,The Best Book on Watergate -- period.,"Sussman was the city editor on the Washington Post when the Watergate burglars were apprehended. It was his story. He teamed Woodward and Bernstein and remained their boss throughout. He knows this story as well as anyone, and has written a riveting account of the greatest scandal in American politics in our lifetime. If you're interested in Watergate, Nixon, etc. -- this book is a must-read."
4,give me more horses,"after getting the first video, All Things Horses for my kids for Christmas, I decided to get them the followup, All Things Horses 2. It is a continuation of the first video, and just as fun. Recommended for kids under 8, but i liked it too."
4,Rubber Fingers,"What really is there to say? These are Swingline Medium/Large Rubber Finger Tips, Size 12, 12-Pack. They work just fine."
2,no size for smaller 2 qt dish,"when selling two different dishes in a package, it would be nice to know the size of BOTH dishes... I'm trying to locate a 6x10 sized oblong dish - which seems to be an almost discontinued size by most manufacturers. If the dish was now sold as a part of a pair, the pair would be purchased to obtain the size I'm trying to find. But if only the standard larger size is known, I'll not gamble a purchase to find out the smaller size is not the right size."
4,great old time entertainment,well if you enjoy watching old time entertainment this is a very enjoyable movie it brings you back to older slower time in history
4,NOT A BAD DEAL,"AT THE TIME THAT I BOUGHT THESE, IT CAME OUT TO 12.00 PER UNIT (24.00 FOR THE PAIR) VERY GOOD DEAL...AMAZON ADVERTISES THAT IT COMES WITH CHARGING UNITS AND IT DOES NOT. BE VERY CAREFUL. I HAVE COMPLAINED AND IT STILL SAYS IT ON THE WEBSITE FOR 2WEEKS NOW. APART FROM THAT -ITS A PRETTY NICE UNIT, RECEPTION IS FINE (NOT 10MILES THOUGH) ABOUT 1-2 MILES ON A BUSY HIGHWAY..BATTERY LIFE IS POOR.. WITH CONSTANT USE, YOU CAN GET ALMOST 1 DAY OUT OF IT. 4 AAA BATTERIES. THE RECHARGABLE UNIT IS A MUST..BUT FOR 12.00 PER UNIT - NOT MUCH ROOM TO COMPLAIN."
2,Poor range for me.,"Does not compare with Motorola. The range was poor. Interestingly, when I pressed the call button, that was transmitted but the recipient couldn't pick up my voice and vice versa. If they work for you, then you have a good deal. But not for me."
3,"It's okay, but awfully thick.",To me this was too thick & sticky. I prefer a creamier gloss. The taste is also not great. Just not for me.
3,so-so,I bought this thinking the pen would be full when I got it...WRONG..it is LESS THAN HALF FULL..and you have to really work and beat and click ot get it out..then its goopy...and thick and is almost invisible...it isnt the pink I thought it would be and its just a gooey mess..I will not buy this again
5,la muisica esta buena.,the SONGS ARE GREAT AND SO ARE THE GUYS THAT MAKE UP THE GROUP. WHEN ARE YOU BABYS COMING TO INDIO CA. OVER HERE TO EL RODEO. PARA VER TUS LINDOS OJITOS. YA TE EXTRANAMOS PAPA.
5,Brawler's Mom,"My son loves Bakugan and really enjoyed this volume. He liked it so much he asked for more. So far we have up to volume 6 and will probably be ordering more. However, since they're so inexpensive, the don't break the bank."
3,Historically interesting but not first rate,"My wife and I watched the DVD. I found the sharpness of the images excellent. The sound track is very good. My wife found that Ingrid Bergman was not really pretty and too large compared to the other cast. She found that Bergman overacted a lot. She also found that Howard was too passive, as in his other films. Overall she found the pace too slow and the story too predictable. I agree somewhat. I believe this film is meant to make us consider what life is all about, and whether we should risk a home for adventure. In this sense there is little action. The acting of the secondary leads was better than the two leading actors. By and large the film is good, but perhaps too much is taken from the Swedish plot. In later films, Bergman's acting improved a great deal--I suspect she was too much into the European style, and adapted with time. Overall good but not great. In an historical perspective a very very good example of transplanted stars and story."
3,DVD is as advertised,"This is not the remake from 1939, but the original version from 1936 as advertised. This 1936 version, directed by the co-author Gustaf Molander, stars Ingrid Bergman as Anita Hoffman, and Gösta Ekman as Holger Brant. The film was remade by director Gregory Ratoff and titled ""Intermezzo: A Love Story"". It was based on the same script written by Gustaf Molander, also starred Ingrid Bergman as Anita Hoffman, but this time cast Leslie Howard as Holger Brant. This is the version that most think of when ""Intermezzo"" comes to to mind. For more detail on the 1936 version, visit http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027796/#comment. For more on the 1939 version, visit http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031491/."
4,Works great if you understand all radios have limitations.,"Own a pair of these, work as well as any order radios. There is a 'Boost' feature that allows broadcast at a higher power if you need more range, unlike other high-power units that constantly broadcast at max power (thus draining the battery quicky).Please note despite Amazon's description, they DO NOT have the NOAA Weather Radio feature. The GMR1588-2CK does."
3,Cheaper end two ways,"These hand held two way radios work pretty well but don't expect them to last any longer than two years. One of mine no longer works, doesn't even turn on no matter what batteries I use in it. If it's going to be used for fun then buy them but if you need a reliable two way then get a better quality radio."
5,Young Viewer!,"I was very young when ER first debuted, to be exact, I was 8 years-old. My Mother and Father put it on in our family room, and I actually watched. To be honest, it was the only show they allowed me to watch at the time. So, needless to say, I grew up watching ER. I fell in love with Noah Wyle from the start. By far, ER was one of the best shows of all time!"
1,"Waste of money, Incorrect description on box","I purchased this product to use whilst I am working away from home - to develop learning materials.After installing the product without the internet connected I found out majority of the clip art is online!You would obviously think that when it is on a DVD ROM and the box states 400,000 clip art ""An entire library of creative images and fonts"" that is what you would get - WRONG!Of the 459,847 items in the search window 410,911 are online!That leaves 48,936 items on the DVD ROMI will never purchase another Broderbund product again."
2,A little better this time...,"I give Britney 2 stars for a slight improvement over her 1st album, but this CD is overall not very good. Britney has no real vocal talent and sings meaningless bubblegum-pop. All I can say is that she has great managers because, considering her complete lack of talent, her CDs are not as bad as some. My least favorite songs on here are ""Oops..."" and ""Satisfaction"". The best tracks are ""Stronger"" and ""Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know""- she almost sounds as if she can sing on these two."
4,Ben lover,T his Cd is pretty good. Even if you are not a Britney Spears fan i think you will like it. The best tracks are Lucky and Oops... I did it again. It is a very fun and vibrant album
1,...Baby one more time again,"The instant success ""Baby one more time"" turned Britney Spears into an international phenomenon. However, her much anticipated sophmore album is a huge shortcoming. The title track cannot be compared to the first hit and the rest of the album is just another remake of her first. For example, the song ""Stronger"" has the repeating line of ""My lonleiness is killing me no more"". What is up with that? Once again her voice has been enhanced with machines yet she will never be able to reach the heights of stars like Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, and Celine Dion, or even her fellow teen peers like Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson and never reach the height of success with any of her ballads like ""Dear Diary"". Britney Spears has 5 years tops."
5,GREAT!,"hey peepz! ok i'm like a kinda sterotypical 13 year old girl, so if you don't really care what i think then don't read this! ~~~~ alrighty then i'm glad you decided to read this, this cd rules. i'm not just sayign this cause i'm a britney fan, but if ur undecided about buying this cd, hen do it1 especially if you liek cds that you can really dance to! i luv yo put this on in my room, and just boogie down to it for an hour or so when ever i've had a bad day! well, u should buy this cd, cause if ya don't, you'll be sry! ps i think brit looks better w/ her hair short, don't you?"
5,Better than average with at least 3 good songs,"My favorite song is ""One Kiss From You"" which is more along the lines of Mariah Carey. Tho Britney, unlike some artists, is not an imitation of other artist: she has her own voice which is a combination of Carey, Madonna, and Jewel, and something else. I wish people would stop comparing her to Christina A. because their singing styles are way different: Christina's style is more base on power of voice like a Whitney Houston. Whereas Spears is more in line with a New Age voice like a Jewel: soft and sweet in other words as most critics have said like Candy. Other songs that are good are ""Oops I Did it Again"" which would be a real treat if you seen the video when it came out and was sold at McDonalds: the video is visually stunning. The other good song is radio favorite: Lucky. The other songs are nice tho I honestly think Her Baby One More Time CD had more hits. Neverless the fact that it has at least 3 good one makes it better than most."
3,In-Between the Lovers and the Haters,"I am stuck somewhere in the middle between those who listen to this c.d. 24/7 and those who would rather eat the c.d. than listen to it. I think Britney is a talented singer, but I get really tired of her constant moaning and groaning in an attempt to make her songs more interesting, and those stupid little intros to the songs where Britney is gossiping with her friends honestly make me cringe. The songs themselves are upbeat and fun, but the lyrics mean absolutely nothing. (If you need proof, find the words to ""Dear Diary"".) Whether or not I like this c.d. really depends on my mood. If I'm cleaning my room and need some energy, I'll pop it in my boom box and sing along. But 70% of the time, I start listening to ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" and end up laughing about how stupid it is beneath the surface."
1,stay away from this,"Britney is sadly targeted in the media. And no I do not think she's a bad mother. The only problem is that she can't write a decent song to save her life. She's no Madonna or Janet. They at least add creativeness to their songs and perform them well. Want proof? Get Madonna's Like A Prayer or J's Rhythm Nation. Back to the product. There's nothing remotely different from her first effort. I mean nothing. And the worst part is that she covered a Rolling Stones classic. I'm surprised Mick and Keith didn't shoot her down for it. Well, they did get their money. Stronger is ear poison to the fullest and the rest of the singles...pure MTV garbage. She's one of the reasons why MTV is going down hill. A great album from 2000 that you all should check out is Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun. If you disagree, then you are officially brainwashed by MTV."
1,Waste money!,"This CD is not as good as I believe! I won't recommend it to my friends! ""Oop! I did it again"" is too similar to ""Baby one more time""! Just listen to the old CD! Wait for next time!"
2,"IS THIS A ""NEW"" RECORD?","The title says it all: she made the same record again. It sounds like an exact duplicate of her first one. If you liked that, Iguess you'll dig this. SATISFACTION does sound ok though, srprisingly."
3,It's aight,"This CD is decent. The stable tracks are of course the ones that were promoted as singles, although ""Don't let me be the last to know"" can be a said exception. It's obvious that Britney can't really hold a note --- but that's not what the album is about anyway. It's more fuel to add to Britney being toted as a sex object and every guy's flooging the bishop fantasy. All in all, it's tight to bump in the car (uh, with your windows rolled up please) for the fast tracks (""What U See (Is What U Get)"", ""Don't Go Knockin At My Door""). If your looking for someone who can actually sing, you need to be lookin else where tho."
5,Hit after hit...she did it again,"This CD is great and the more I listen to it, the more I like. After the worldwide success of ""...baby one more time"", Britney is back, proving she can do it again and as much as she desires.As soon as I put my hands on this album on its release date, I felt it would be a top seller. It has lots of good tracks, all having the potential to be chosen as singles.""Oops!...I did it again"" is a cool track. ""Stronger"" has interesting lyrics, connecting this second CD to her first, and showing that britney is more mature now and totally aware of her popularity. ""Lucky"" is also worth listening, since it shows every star has its moments of loneliness, depression and desilusion. ""Don't let me be the last to know"" is brit's favorite track (mine as well), and it's about a girl who wishes that the boy she likes gets enough courage to show his feelings for her. Pretty interesting for shy people.If you liked britney's first album, this is the one you should buy!"
4,BEST REVIEW,Hello people who are thinking about buying B.Spears new album. All I have to say is that its kinda like the old one. She makes no difference really. Its good dance-pop music. Some slow songs we can do with out because face it she aint no Mariah. But for songs with a good beat and catchy tunes i recommend that this is the album for you. I hope I havent took too much of your time.
5,THE BEST ALBUM OF 2000!,"BRITNEY'S NEW ALBUM ""OOPS I DID IT AGIAN""IS WAY BETTER THEN HER LAST ALBUM.MY FAVE TRACKS ARE ""LUCKY"",""WHAT U SEE IS WHAT U GET"",AND DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW"".I DID NOT KNOW BRITNEY HAD A VOICE IN THE SONG ""WHERE ARE YOU NOW"".AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO LOVE ""OOPS..I DID IT AGIAN"".BRITNEY IS NOW THE BEST!"
1,Come on!,"I can't believe people actually buy this garbage. This is the very lowest of music forms. First off, Britney doesn't even write her own music, all she does is show skin. She has no real talent because shes a [sham.] Not to worry though, because I think she only has 2 albums let and then no one will care anymore. Then, she will start doing Playboy shoots to start her popularity up and find out thats all shes good at. Her family will then abandon her, no one will respect except [warped individuals] and then her demise will be complete"
1,THIS ALBUM SUX,"ANOTHER ALBUM THAT JUST PLAIN SUX. I REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHO LISTENS TO THIS GARBAGE. HOW DID SHE EVEN GET A RECORD DEAL. BUT I'M LOVING THAT ""DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW"" VIDEO. ALL THIS GIRL EVER WILL BE IS SOME HOT CHICK CAN'T SING."
5,"Yes she did, and much better!","I bought this album the day it came out, and i haven't gotten sick of it yet. From the title track on thru the end, I was shocked at how good this album was. ""Stronger,"" ""One Kiss From You,"" ""Lucky,"" ""Satisfaction,"" ""Don't Go Knockin On My Door,"" and ""What U See (Is What U Get)"" are great great examples of what 'perfect pop' shold sound like. Not only is her album great, her ""Oops!"" tour was one of my favourite concerts I have been to. She's a great performer, a beautiful girl, and one of my all time favourites. Can't wait til the next album...if you don't own this and it's predecessor ""...Baby One More Time"" I HIGHLY recommend you pick them up...they are absolutely DELIGHTFUL."
2,She lied she didn't do it again,"While the music from this CD was okay at best, Britney just does not seem to have an original idea in her entire body. Do what people tell her, go wherever they say to go, etc. I found it very empty. The music might sound good, but that's about all you can say. What she says in her songs on this CD is very lacking. Hands down across the board."
1,This album angers me.,"To start off, i dislike like album, and with a passion. Britney spears has no voice, no talent. She is only surviving on her above average looks. Secondly, has anybody noticed that all of her songs sound the same. They use the same keyboards for almost every track. This angers me. A lot. I can't begin to explain how much this album angers me. So in conclusion, Britney Spears is a teen sensation much like the new kids on the block, and her time will be up soon."
1,Debbie Gibson could at least sing....,"This CD is absolute teeny-bopper crap. Yes, she's georgeous, and I guess she can dance, but a singer she ain't. Debbie Gibson and Tiffany could at least hold a tune! Don't get me started on N Sync and the Backstreet Boys -- a GUARANTEE HERE --in five years all of these worthless ""artists"" will have their own VH1 ""Where are They Now""?Bottom line -- Pass on purchasing this garbage."
1,"wow, this was amazingly bland","this was one of the great cd's of the millenium! all the songs are so much alike, and this cd sounds just like her last one! not only that, but her cd sounds like bsb, nsync, christina agulera, and the list goes on! i have to tell you, i would gladly pay money to own this cd, and burn it! and man! what great ideas for songs! who hasn't thought of singing songs about misery in love, and how great their lovers are! wow, and don't get me started on the great tunes! you can barely tell them apart from each other! i think her writers must be thirilled with how much alike they sounds!well, this is what you're all thinking, and you know it."
3,Not quite #1 material.,"This cd was okay, but not nearly worth a five star rating though. The 3 stars I did give were mainly attributed to the good lyrics in a few songs. My favorite songs were ""Lucky"" and ""Oops!..I Did it Again"". My major disappointment was that, like, ALL the songs had talking in them, which, in my opinion is just plain annoying. I don't know if guys feel like you're getting jipped, but I sure do. If we wanted to hear her talk, couldn't we just turn on the TV and hear an interveiw, or buy a whole cd devoted completely to hearing her talk, talk , talk? That's just my opinion."
1,Only gave it one star because I had to,"Don't worry about what Britney's new CD sounds like. You probably already know. It's full of the same bubble gum pop and nasal tones as the last one. And if you're not sick of it already, this album will make you run to the toilet. ""Oops"" showcases, yet again, Britney's lack of vocal range and singing ability. However, there are quite beautiful pictures of the untalented little girl in the album's insert, giving the impression that on THIS album she grew up...then you put it in your CD player and find out she, like everything else associated with her, was just utilizing false advertising. Her most horrible mistake is her monotone cover of The Rolling Stones' ""I Can't Get No Satisfaction,"" in which she positively butchered a classic. This CD is better for a coaster or a frisbee for the dog, if you want to spend that much money."
1,Oops is right!,"Sounds like her last cd and just as bad! I'm surprised that Shania Twain would want such an untalent to sing her beautiful music! (Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know). What's even worse is that Britney only thanked Shania's husband for the song and not Shania! She then had the nerve to say on television that he wrote all Shania's music, which is untrue. I think Britney is jealous of Shania when all she should be is grateful!"
5,Britney is Amazing!!,"Britney's ""Oops...I Did It Again"" is one the best CD's ever. If you thought ""Baby...One More Time"" was good, this one is 10 times better. There's something for everyone: fast-paced songs that make you want to get up and dance like ""Oops"", ""Stronger"", ""Don't Go Knockin' On My Door"", ""What U See"", and ""Can't Make You Love Me"". There's also nice ballads such as ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"" and ""Where Are You Now"". My personal recemendation is ""Lucky"", it's a great song with a lot of meaning. Britney is an amazing singer with a super voice and just keeps getting better. This CD is awesome and I deffinetley recemend that you pick it up. It's well worth the money."
1,Garbage,"If I could rate this zero stars, I would. Anyone who says they like this is playing mind games with themselves! Britney Spears has an occasional interesting throaty vocal--but by and large her music (and videos) are absolutely terrible! The lyrics, the composition, the performance, it's all cheese! Commercially designed to sell to young girls! And you're buying into it, congratulations."
2,Baby One Time Part 2,"This album just shows that Britney is musically illiterate. I mean, Oops is just a rehashed reedited version of Baby One More Time. By the cheeky title, it proves that she has done it again - had her brilliant production team redo the song that made her famous and exploding onto the charts. The rest of the songs are okay except Satisfaction, which got a funky cover , but other than that, there nothing to write home about."
2,A big disappointment,"I must admit, this cd was a huge disappointment. Britney needs to learn what the word ""diversification"" means. All her songs sound the same...."
1,Time to go back to school,"Absolute trash..has a deservant place in the bin, not taking up all the space in record shops!The shops could be filled with far better CD's, like those of James, U2, Bluetones etc. But..there filled with this teenage-appealing trash.It's not even worth the disc it is written on. I would've given it no stars had I had the choice."
3,"Could be better, could be worse","Britney Spears' new album does not meet my expectations, but is not a complete bomb. Oops I Did it Again was a good song, but radio stations overplay it. When I listen to the radio at home, in my car, and everywhere else, I always hear Oops. I Can't Get No Satisfaction was a good song, but not accompanied by Britney Spears' bubble gum voice and the very irritating ""uh""s. Lucky is the only song I would rate 5 stars. Where Are You Now and When Your Eyes Say It can be considered ""filler"". I would recommend loaning it from a friend or downloading some MP3s to see if you like it before buying the album."
1,Please,"I will resist the temptation to make any of the cracks the title of this CD offers us. I was fine with Britney Spears making her disposable garbage for the gullible, close-minded masses until she went too far - covering a Stones' song, and probably their best one at that. Hearing ""(Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" covered with all the poppy bubblegum added is like listening to yourself slowly choke to death. This track is such an insult to the ears it almost makes the rest of the 15 dollar piece of plastic sound good. I can't even believe her producers and whatnot let her do this. Imagine if Debbie Gibson had covered ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds""! Britney, please fade away just as quickly as any bad trend but do it without covering classic songs."
2,"Yeah, unfortunately, she did it again...","The title track's rather weak, in my opinion. The other songs are almost equally forgettable. The redeeming songs are 'Stronger' and 'Lucky,' and they'd be even better if it wasn't Britney singing them. Currently she has a vocal range of about three notes, and all the moaning and groaning doesn't help much either. I read somewhere that we're being sold pure hype, and that's pretty much how I feel. I only hope that, in the event that she'll put out another album, someone will take the time to teach her how to sing an entire octave."
3,Could've been much better,"after the huge xitement over getting the CD the first day it came out, i was slightly disappointed with the music. Of course Oops, and some of the other songs are great but I still feel the first CD was easier to enjoy. Personally my love for pop music has shifted more to Mandy's style as of now."
1,"wow, she can dance!...and she has a pretty smile...","...but in the end of it all, that does not lead to good music. what ever happened to the days when the writer/composer of the music was heralded? that is where the talent lies anyways, right? it doesn't matter how well anyone can sing (and britney does not have that good of a voice anyway), but the music itself is what we love to hear. let's get back to the days when we honored those that actually wrote the music and not the performers."
2,"Not completely worthless, but average and sometimes painful","I'll admit, i loathe all that is connected with pop music and teeny boppers. I'll also admit that this isn't the worst thing i've ever heard. Britney is a decent singer and certainly has presence. And she has indeed grown up from her paper-thin facade of a little schoolgirl. But she also sings incredibly predictable mainstream pop that seems recycled through four or five groups/singers like her. The cover of Satisfaction is really hard to listen to and i found myself legitmately angry after hearing it. Overall it is just really average pop garbage and i can only hope music moves away from this lame mediocrity very soon. In five years, we'll look back at this era and laugh at these people like we do now at Samantha Fox or New Kids On The Block. Come on, kids, we can do better!"
4,Britney Spears,"If you like Mandy Moore, Christina Aguilera and so on you'll like this cd it's a pretty good cd. If your buying it for your kid and she likes what I said before she'll like it."
2,"Does the phrase, ""negative role model"" mean anything?","In a world of constantly evolving teens into a more and more sexually active and violent society it seems that Britney has added her own ideal of what the typical teenie bopper should be. Grotesque and ultimately too revealing, her fashion sense gives the American teenager the idea that dressing less is acceptable. I'm not saying that long skirts and long sleeve shirts are correct, but where are the days when not showing skin was MORE provactive? These days nothing is left to the imagination, what a shame since imagination can often be more stimulating. Britney tells the teenage girls of today that sex sells, and boy does she use it to sell her album. Her voice is like a nasal piccolo. The songs have no substance and the believability that Britney has acutally experienced any of the lyrics is laughable. My suggestion, if you have an IQ of 2, buy this album, since you're probably in a vegetative state anyway."
4,"Preety good cd, but not as good as the first one","I have to admit when i heard the cd for the first time it wasnt that great. But when you listen to it more it gets better and better. I really like what you see is wat u get and lucky. The rest of the other songs are preety good too except dear diary. I cant stand that song. Its so annoying. Other then that its a preety good cd and i really recommend you to buy it. People probably give this cd such bad reviews just cause there jealous of her, cuz shes preety, a good singer, and a great dancer. If people say that she cant sing, then how did she even get two cds released. THat has to show talent for singing. I mean she already sold like twenty million copies."
4,Britney's Feel-Good Pop,"Well, I am hated for my opinion of this CD, but I love it. While Britney is simply a manufactured bubblegum singer, and a manufactered teen sex symbol, this CD is plain fun to listen to. I love ""Oops..."", ""Lucky,"" ""One Kiss from You,"" ""what you see,"" ""Stronger,"" and ""Can't make you Love me."" I dislike Britney's much-talked about cover of ""Satisfaction,"" but that is the only sore spot for me. I love to sit and listen to this CD when I feel like smiling or just goofing around. Some people will dislike the strained vocals Britney delivers, as well as the many effects that are used on her voice. This is not a CD for people that love strong vocals ONLY. I'm a stickler for a great leading voice (Celine Dion, Bono, Pat Monahan of Train), but I still appreciate a good, catchy pop song. Bottom line: if you like feel-good pop music, you'll love this CD."
1,this is an idiot cd,"whatever she sings.... man! it's idiotic!!! it's obvious that she's just cashing in on her 'popularity' and this is just a bag of s***. the woman can't sing, she just basically sells herself to get album sales and people... it's just the packaging. the song oops i did it again is such an inane piece of drivel that it's sickening that there are people who writes this kind of stuff and call it art!!! i wanted to give this a -20 marks fer it's sheer ridiculousness but they wouldn't let me. the song stronger nearly killed me the 1st time i heard it because at the start she was shouting GREARGHHHHHH... YEEEAAAAAHHH!!!! and i thought that a frog was stuck in her throat! the song is really tasteless coz it's not 'catchy' and the beat is terrible... it just flies everywhere and it sounds worse than any racket that my 1 year old niece can produce. i can't even believe they're selling this vile pile of horrible, horrible art!!!"
2,Eh... An okay sophomore album effort,"Im not a big Britney Spears fan but I do like some songs in this album. The one that stands out for me is ""oops I did it again"", ""stronger"", and ""can't make you love me"". Those are the only tracks I think is appealing and danceable to listen to. The rest are pretty annoying and in my opinion will only appeal to younger teens. But i had to give Britney's album a chance cause she's one hot girl!"
2,Britney Speared,"I am not a Brit-Basher, and make no attempts to be. However, this album was pretty weak. Although Britney is the ""Pop Princess"" she simply hasn't any substance. Her rendition of ""Satisfaction"" is extremely untrue to the original, and a great disappointment. This album lacks in identity. This CD was a fun listen for a week or so, but the novelty of ""Oops..."" has worn off, and the CD has sat in the rack ever since. Don't waste your time on something with so little longevity."
2,Oops! I Bought This CD,"Will Britney Spears do it again? The answer: Not with this album. The title song Oops!...I Did It Again is okay, but every other song on the album sounds exactly like it. On the few that don't, such as her ballads and Satisfaction (I Can't Get No) her voice is strained as she struggles to make the high notes. She doesn't have the voice for anything that's not computer-enhanced like most her songs, so she shouldn't screw up perfectly good songs trying to sing them."
1,Who are you kidding?,"When I first bought ""baby one more time"" I wasnt really impressed.The only good songs on there are, ""baby One More Time"" ""Crazy"" and ""Sometimes"". The ones she picks out for singles. Thats how these people get you to buy these Cds!They pick out the 3 or 4 good songs, turn them into singles, and keep the other junk on the CD.I wasnt really happy with it, but when ""oops I did It Again"" came out i thought Id give it another try. Same old thing."
1,Huhhh???,"Please tell me how this CD's average rating is 3.5 star when the highest visible rating is 3 and the others are all 1 star??? Is it just an artificial boost for this unfortunate young cele-britney, ""pushed"" somewhat into the stardom she feels so ""reluctant"" to be in. I've heard this CD, some parts are catchy but all in all, you could spend your money on something else and feel more satisfied. I feel in general people are getting somewhat tired of the wining baby vocals that don't ""cut-it"" on stage. The first few months of the debut album was interesting but I suggest that Britney look into other avenues of the entertainment industry. She's a terribly good looking girl so may be film... but that's not very imaginative (kinda like this album)??? Thanks for reading."
2,Oops! She Did it Again!,"It's another album of mediocre songs designed to have Britney shake her halfnaked body on MTV. Britney's voice is just odd. Unlike that tonedeaf Alanis Morissette, Britney can actually hit the notes but her voice..well..it's...um... it's just not very good. It's just an ordinary voice singing a bunch of mediocre songs. Just like Morissette, Britney's key to success is her packaging. In the case of Alanis, she's billed as an ""angry female"" (it's own tired genre) while Britney's packaging is literally her packaging (something that clearly can't be said about Alanis!). It looks great, but you can easily look at it while listening to something else.I bought this CD for the karaoke tracks because ""fixing"" these songs in karaoke is an incredible amount of fun."
4,"Britney is an entertainer, not a musician!","I really enjoy this album and cannot wait for her new one to come out. I am not a big fan of pop music, but Britney's music is just so catchy and fun, I cannot help but to like it. What a lot of people complain about is the way she dresses and how she doesn't write her own music. Although I don't like the way she dresses and she doesn't write her own music, she is a great entertainer. She is an awesome dancer! You have to take her for what she truly is, not compare her to something she isn't. As for all the other girls in pop (Christina, Jessica, Mandy...etc) I think they are just trying to ride off of Britney's fame!"
2,"Better Than ""Baby One More Time!""","""Oops!... I did it again"" is a good try by Britney. This is not the best CD in the world but it is Extemely better than the album ""Baby One More Time."" There are many good songs on here Like the title track, ""What U See Is What U Get"", ""Cant Make You Love Me"", and ""Stronger"". There are the annoying songs like the ballads ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know,"" ""When Your Eyes Say It"" and the extremely horrendous ""One Kiss From You"" which is what many people call filler space. All together it was a good try by Ms. Spears. So If your a Britney Fan than this CD is For you."
3,Tolerable...,"Very cliche, but fun, nonetheless. You can't help but dance to such tracks as Stronger, Oops!...I Did It Again, and Don't Go Knockin' On My Door. .... Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know...oh goodness...sorry, Brit...stick to the fast, fun, bubble-gum-pop dance tunes you're best at."
3,She's going to have to grow up sooner or later...,"Okay, Britney Spears has an obvious pop appeal that drives young people crazy. No one can deny that. If she was, however, a stronger vocalist and not a producers' puppet, her music would be so much better. The title track is an infectious tune that I couldn't get out of my head for weeks. ""Stronger"" is pure girl power and hides her weak vocals substantially well.That's just it! If she was a stronger singer and half of the irritating background noise was cut out, this album, and Spears herself, would be more impressive. If Britney wants a long career, she is going to have to grow up sooner or later. The Spice Girls had to. Their new album is set to a mature, R&B beat. They found the key to appealing to a more mature audience and perhaps longevity. Pop eventually BURNS OUT! So will Britney...Just like Debbie Gibson and Tiffany."
1,Redundant,This is not good. Oops sounds like Baby one more time. Hello! Be original. I am a R&B fan and I do not think many R&B people will buy this bubble gum album. Britney should work on her vocals.
1,Uh Oh............,"This album stinks!There is no denying that!All of her vocals are covered up and made into robotic space-aged sounds.Britney really has talent for singing,but OUCH!"
2,Britney rules but her music doesn't,"I wanna nail her as much as the next guy but her music is weak.First of a rolling stones cover,that is more funny than sad Oh well at least she has all those pic's in rolling stones.Oh yeah and her Vma performance.Woo Woo"
3,Alright 4 A Sophmore Effort,"I like this CD b-cuz it showz that Britney can move 4ward in her career, and more kool songs are the result of that. My faves are: ""Stronger"", and ""One Kiss From You"". All of the other songs are pretty catchy, and all sound different. Some songs can be a little sappy though."
4,Best Briney album !,"This album is terrific. In this album, there are 3 WONDEFUL songs, and they are :Oops I did it again - 5/5Stronger - 5/5Don't let me be the last to know - 5/5Hey ! I like this album not because she can dance well, or because she is just popular! I buy her albums because I like her music! Take my advice, and buy this only for the music. And I really recommend to buy this album."
4,She did it again!!!,"Okay,I'm going to rate each song seprate,because this CD has a few REALLY bad songs and some REALLY good ones too........Oops!..I Did It Again-4 stars,not bad,but not the best.....Stronger-3 stars,Cool words,but terrible voice......Don't go knocking on my door-4 stars,Not bad,but not the best...Satisfaction-4 stars,???...Don't let Me be the last to know-3 stars,It's a great song,but I personally don't like it....What U See Is What U Get-5 stars,fantastic!!!Lucky-6 stars!!!...Okay,I know the scale only goes up to 5 stars but this is the BEST song ever!!!...One Kiss from You-4 stars.Where are you Now-5 stars,really nice.Can't Make You Love Me-5 Stars,Awesome!!!When your eyes say It-2 stars,Rotten!Dear Diary-0 stars!!!This is the WORST SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!..."
3,Not too bad,"I happen to like several of the songs on this cd, but what gets annoying is that they all do sound very similar. I have read reviews saying that her voice in this cd is much more adult but I strongly disagree. Her voice is so distorted and high pitched in most of the songs that she sounds like a little girl. Also, the ""uh"" at the end of every word (as an attempt to add sexuality to the songs) gets annoying after awhile. I like the beat of the songs and am glad I bought this cd, but there is just only so much you can take. I would recommend this cd to anyone that enjoyed her last one."
2,Ops is right,"Ok, this CD (for most part) is like having your computer sing to you. There are soo much synthesizer and sound effects in lots of the songs. The lyrics are good for most part, that's where the two stars came from. One Ops was ok, but making the fast track songs similar to Ops or Baby One More Time is just too much. In regards to Britney CO-WRITING one song, that's nice but it does not make her the most talented person in the music industry. I would say Mariah Carey, the Jackson's, Madonna, even the new group M2M has more talent in that department than Britney. She's co-writing, not writing and arranging the music. Christina Aguilera, who also co-wrote or wrote one song, is more talented in regards to voice quality. Even if Christina didn't write a single song, she sounds great with just a piano."
2,"OOPS, is an oops!","The lyrics are good, the music is catchy, but the girl has no talent. She's managed to ruin some potentially good songs! Do us a favor... give the music to someone who will do it justice."
4,This album is great,"I just wanted to say this album is WAY better than her first one! My fave songs are ""Stronger"" and ""Lucky"""
2,only 3 songs are worth it,"only stronger, satisfaction and don't go knocking on my door are okay songs, though britney brings nothing new to the music table"
3,Not a bad cd.,This album really surprised me. I thought it was going to totally suck but there are some good memorable songs on it. The two I'm talking about are Don't let me be the last to know and Stronger. These 2 tracks make this album somewhat worthwhile. The other songs truly sound like each other and Britney really needs to come up with new material on her next album. Otherwise you can say bye bye bye to this pop princess.
1,Oops! I threw you away!,"I can understand her feelings and thoughts on her 1999 album, but this album is totally trash. Her songs are really short, and most songs have talking in it which isn't called music. And her CD doesn't look like good music, but it looks like she is using her appearance to sell it. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"
1,Ooops..I dropped this CD in the used bin!,"Yes, she did it again. She duplicated the sound of her first album almost to a tee. For that, she gets an A. But this album just further proves that she will not be around for long. She shows no growth and has the same teeny bop voice that she has always had. Her rendition of ""Satisfaction"" is a complete disgrace to the song and the Rolling Stones. Another flash in the pan, another teenage media-made pinup. Her best performance does not even come close to Christina Aguilera's worst."
1,Some observations,Miss Spear's latest offering is rather like that rash you caught last time you visited a cathouse: unsightly; irritating; disturbingly contagious; difficult to get rid of; guiltily acquired when the wife's back was turned; worryingly familiar. The public should be warned.
5,"Yes, I'd say she did it again.","I'm a 14-year old guy, so you'd think you know why I like Britney, right? WRONG! So she's hot, big deal! She has a voice unlike any other except for Jessica Simpson among teen pop queens. All the songs are quality written, except for Dear Diary. Let's just say Britney should stick to the singing. Max Martin is an incredible songwriter and Britney sings the songs amazingly well. From the fast tempo songs- ""Oops!"", ""Stronger"", ""Lucky"", and ""Can't Make You Love Me""- to the slower songs- ""Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know"", ""Where Are You Now"", and ""When Your Eyes Say It""- Britney handles the lyrics very well. If you're looking for a quality CD with songs that could all be singles, listen to this one!"
2,Wait till it goes on sale..,"This CD isn't the best.The songs that are good are ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" (sounds like a guy is in love with her but she isnt in love with him). ""What U See (Is What U Get)"" (her refusing to change the way she presents herself in public), ""Stronger"" and ""Lucky"". I like these songs because she was being honest.The songs ""One Kiss From You"", ""Where Are You Now"", ""Can't Make You Love Me"", ""When Your Eyes Say It"", Dear Diary"", ""Don't Go Knockin' On My Door"" and ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" should not have been on the disc. And the bonus songs are no good either. They aren't good as far as lyrics, vocals and music.Overall, this disc is about personal preference. I am not a child so I am going to expect more from my music. And she just didn't give me much to work with on this CD. I was really dissapointed. I thought she would have grown from the first cdas far as quality."
2,Annoying Corporate Pop,"Britney Spears had a major hit in the early twenty-first century with the annoyingly catchy ""Oops...I Did It Again"". One of her relatively early hits (the first being ""Hit Me Baby One More Time""), it only furthered the deathgrip that the young dancer had on the nation. However, unfortunately, said deathgrip was not enough to mean that she could make good music. ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" features ambigouous lyrics obviously not crafted by Mrs. Spears and no attempt for any material of note. Most of it, in fact, is just overproduced bubblegum. Other than for her fans, not worth the buy."
1,The Lost Jewel,"I don't know how people can give this movie 3 stars. Don't waste your money. This movie stunk!I don't have a problem with Amazon Prime, I think it's a great deal, but sometimes I come across a movie that is awful. This was one of those times. The Forgotten Jewel with Jackie Chan was rotten, and I don't recommend you wasting your money on this movie."
1,Don't waist your money/ This is a home made flick,Horrible Horrible Horrible! I think this is the wrong video and i was retarded enough to spend my money. I am so tempted to call amazon and ask for a refund because this is not the correct movie! i am so disappointed right now.
4,An overall coverage of the history of modern geodesy,"I found Mr. Smith's book to be very informative and well written. He covers many aspects of geodesy from early history to modern application. He is apparently very knowledgable and has a broad spectrum of experiences which he writes about. There are some instances when Mr. Smith tells a large amount of information, maybe more than the average reader would require. There are other times that I wished he would tell me more. He has a writing style that tends to skip around alot. Just hang in there and you will get the information in another chapter. There is always the bibliography for reference, if, Mr. Smith didn't cover it, which is rare indeed. He covers such obscure subjects such as: coriolis effect, isostasy and dynamic heights. Throughout the book all of the illustrations are simple yet understandable in almost all cases."
3,On The Road To Hollywood,"Yeah, Bingo and Handsome again, on the road from Brooklyn to Hollywood,notes of historical interest provided by Handsome's perfect photographic memory,pass through a town called Thursday, in Iowa.They buy a turkey farm and 500 turkeys,that will be worth $10.00 each in three to four weeks,because the poor farmer's mother is very ill in Illinoisand he can't stick around to make that profit,so will let it all go for $2000.00.Hmmmmm, there seems to be a pattern here;""buying the Brooklyn Bridge"" but somehow profiting from it anywayby solving a crime, aided by Handsome's perfect photographic memory,with the usual looney and shady characters, and in this case,a low down character, a little too real, that seems out of her style.(My dust jacket does not suggest this. *Oh, I have a used hardcover edition.)Their adventure started in New York City with ""The Sunday Pidgeon Murders"",which I know of but haven't read."
3,Delicious and Exciting,"Delicious and Exciting are the only words to describe the experience of hearing the sounds that I cannot wait to hear again and again. Not only is this a hit, this is what one lives for to hear these sounds."
3,NIce pendant...,"Nice look, good construction. The finish is okay (look as if it has been handmade, quickly. Lots of glue keeping everything together.) Nevertheless : completly satisfied with it."
3,I found it interesting,"I recently purchased this DVD at one of the only remaining record shops left in my area out of pure curiosity. I didn't see the fine print that read ""contains no Radiohead music"" on it until I got home but still wanted to see it. Probably the most interesting aspect of this dvd was the feature that showed still pictures of where the band grew up in Oxford (from where they worked to the street they lived on). I've never seen this before so it was new to me. There's very little actual ""Radiohead"" here and I think I paid way too much for it ($20) but if you're a die-hard fan you'll find it at the very least, interesting. A better option is to try and find it on YouTube and not waste your time with the dvd."
1,Nahhh.....,"These shoes are definately not for you if you intend to be on your feet a lot, especially at work. The sparkles started falling off of the shoes within the first few hours of wearing them, and the bottom sides of the shoe are peeling away from the leather already, only after 1 weekk!!! I DON'T recommend them to anyone else."
5,A colorfull voyage into psychedelic soul,"The album contains tracks which cover a wide slice of modern electronic music. The music takes you on a trip full of surprises. From tracks like prozak that ""floats arond"" to micro.com that drives on a complet diferent levels. Great production combined with tastefull selection of sounds."
3,Good,"Its a nice book, i actually bought for my mother in law and she likes it. Some of they things the book ask you for are very hard to find."
2,Disapointing,"Wait to check out the paperback from the library. Ed Morales' best writing was at the beginning of his career in the Village Voice, where he displayed a passion for writing. This book smacks of someone trying to stay relevant in a desperate fashion akin to a Crackhead looking for rock in the gutter."
3,neither great or bad,"kind of hard to follow at times and the ending was very dry. what happen to the end of the play,it leaves you hanging"
2,"Good concept, bad follow thru","Not sure where the ball was dropped on this one, but it dropped. It became quite predictable about 30 minutes in. And it seemed to me as if the storyline was drawn out way too long."
5,Suicida Tendencies Best Album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you don't have ""join the army"" and you like S.T. then you should stop reading this and get this amazing blend of hardcore and trash metal.Best track for me: Join the army, a little each day, the prisoner, war inside my head, i feel your pain, possessed to skate, no name no words, looking in your eyes."
5,A powner full book,"This was the first Lucado I read, and to me it is still the finest, capturing the foreboding, the agony and the ultimate triumph in terms that anyone can understand."
3,Rain EP,"this is more of an EP than a mxi-single1. Rain/Radio Mix: this is a much tamer version, and, somehow takes away the power of the original. It's not bad, but it's not better than the original.2. Waitin/Remix: i like this mix although i usually hate hip hop music. i think she actually redid some of the vocals on this mix3. Up Down Suite: this is an extended dub of a song called ""Goodbye To Innocence"", which can be found on the compilation ""Just Say Roe"". Goodbye To Innocence is much better than up down suite so go check that one out.4.Rain/LP: of course, the origingal. very good"
1,Torch This!,"I received my order yesterday and was shocked by the lack of quality and craftmanship. These torches online looked beautiful and substantial but in fact are cheap and poorly made. I ordered mine through Target.com and now I have to pay shipping on top of it to return them? These torches when ordering 3, averaged $21.66 each and with shipping, $26.33 each. I would not pay more than $2 per torch. I urge you not to purchase this item!"
2,"KJV, drawings seem feminine","I like the one-page story summaries, but most people who buy this book probably have something similar in a children's Bible. The drawings include a verse in King James, which is not what I use with my children so it really just confuses them. The drawings themselves are elaborately detailed, which is fine, maybe better for older children. The style seems somehow romanticized or feminine to me; the men all have long curly, flowy ""locks"" of hair, drapey robes, etc. Somehow it just feels girly to me."
2,Good information but some bad theories,"The author does provide good information on the status of women in the ancient world, but has some completely baseless theories. She tries to juxtapose the masculine Persian god Mithras with the feminine god Isis, claiming Isis was supressed and Mithras welcomed. The problem is, Mithrism, after Christianity and Judaism, was persecuted heaviest because it was though to indicate loyalty to Persia, Rome's enemy. Isis, on the other hand, after some early initial efforts to ban all foreign religions, was fully tolerated. It saw nothing like the persecution the other three religions saw. Also, she overstates Isis as a feminist figure. Most papyrus quotes from ancient Egypt have her worshiped as a traditional wife and mother goddess. All she has as proof of her contention that wasn't so is one Oxyrhyncus papyrus quote and a quote from the always unreliable Diodorus."
4,Great history.,"One of, if not the best, compact source for classical women's history. Readable and comprehensive."
5,The Farmers Daughter,I purchased this film on DVD however it was not even second class I got rooked constantly stops freezes I am heartbroken did not buy from Amazon. From another movie connnection. I hope i can get a DVD within a reasonable amount
3,"Smells good, but doesn't last very long","I bought this originally for my Yorkie-poodle mix, who was blessed with the poodle hair in which it's very wiry and curly. I usually have him groomed about every 6 weeks, but it's winter so I'm keeping his coat long so he doesn't freeze. I use this spray first, brush, then lightly spray again. I like the smell, but I just wished the shine and conditioning lasted longer. I don't think he makes it through the whole day with his fur looking like it did when I get finished."
3,Tin set VS non stick,I purchased the same set..but in tin coated metal which is not flimsy. There is no indication as to whether the nonstick is aluminum or steel. I have also gotten several free sets of cookie cutters with other purchases and the guage of the cutters appears to be similiar....to the set I bought.I would like to see a similiar set but in smaller sizes..diameter. Ignore the 3 rating as I did not buy the nonstick set. I would give the tin set 4 stars.
3,Prayer Book,Product received in the time frame promised and was as advertised. Not an expensive item. Ideal for my needs. .
2,Too Abbreviated,I enjoy having the prayers and yearly readings but this book is a little too abbreviated for me. Maybe if I were a lot more familiar with Catholic Prayers (I'm a new Catholic still waiting to be completly converted) I would like it. If you are a new Catholic it's not very helpful.
5,Story time,This book is best for 4th graders and up. The stories are good to use for inferencing and questioning strategies. The length of the stories are perfect for those brief times when I need a meaningful filler activity in my classroom. Good stories to enjoy before bedtime or as class read alouds.
1,My Movie,This movie was good in its day. But this copy was of poor quality the movie was hard to see as if it was a very low quality copy. Save your money it was not worth it.
1,Totally Upset,"I am totally upset with this product. First off the description on Amazon, does not even mention that this thing is made of Styrofoam ($40 for a Styrofoam plane). R we serious? This is a plane, exactly how does making it Styrofoam make it durable in any way. 2. none of the parts stay on the darn thing. 3. After a short 20 minute charge you will be lucky to get exactly 1 minute of flying time out of this things. Its garbage, and i wouldn't waste my money on it again. The kids were very disappointed which just made me even more upset that i bought it. I don't mean to knock it down so hard, but i guess it was such a disappointment to us, i just can't see myself recommending it."
2,remotecontrol broncoRCelectricRTF2CHreadytoflyradiocontrol,this plane flys very well but the directions stink and the plane is very hard to build
5,Great Book,"This is a Great Book for Trained your Ministerial Staff, I think every Pastor or Church Leader Buy this Book for your staff"
2,Not a real VDO fan.,"Although product is advertised as VDO, and has a VDO sticker on the box, it is just a repackaged Chinese brand fan."
4,Good investment Advise.,"All I have to say is BOO YAHH!If your looking here you already know Cramer is King.Respectfully, Dennis Lloyd"
3,Cramer's Mad Money,"The overwhelming majority of the book is a sales pitch/pep talk about investing. It's a good book if you need to convince yourself to invest. If you're already a believer in stock market investing, I would skip the book."
1,Cramer's Insane Investing Ideas,Cramer is the type of guy who loves to be the center of attention and loves to hear himself lecture other people on how to invest in a volatile market. Problem is that this guy has made so many poor stock picks since his show went on the air that most people now just laugh at him. This clown will one day tell his viewers to pick up shares in company X and then next week tell them to sell it. He flip-flops on so many companies that I really believe he is Insane like the title of the book suggests. He often tells his viewers that he used to run a hedge fund. I can't imagine how much money he lost for his clients.
1,"Good for basic advice, but don't listen to his picks","This is an interesting book to learn basics of the market. However, Jim Cramer has lost me and others in my family a ton of money. On his show he recommended Cheasepeake Energy, Encana etc. We all bought many of his stocks and years later have lost our shirts. Therefore, I say buy low and sell high and looks at the fundamentals. I think Cramer is a phony. He recommends stocks then doesn't speak about them when they tank. Therefore, why doesn't he take the advice he gives in his book. Or doesn't it work."
3,Real Money Lacks his TV show charm,"I am a big fan of Jim Cramer and a regular watcher of his Mad Money in CNBC.I bought this book recently in much anticipation.This is the first Jim Cramer book I ever bought.Eventhough the book is good in content, it lacks the charm of Jim Cramer.I couldn't find it very readable like. Honestly it is bit boring.I wish he would improve this part in his future books."
2,At Least His BOOK Is QUIET....,"Really, I figured what could it hurt to read & listen. Tried all his ideas, watched his picks on TV etc. Set up HIS ideal portfolios on my trading page where I trade stocks. After 2 years what are the results? Cramer's picks as well as Vectorvest picks got CREAMED compared to MY own idiotic attempts at making money long term as well as short term.So, do what you like, but if ever in San Diego & you want this book? You can have mine for FREE. Do however pay attention to his common sense ""get out of debt"" strategy."
5,Took about an hour to install.,"This is a great product! Timken has been around for years and I was very impressed with the Quality of this Bearing assembly. Made in the USA and the quality shows it.I installed this on my wife's 2003 Saturn VUE. It was a real easy install, about an hours worth of work.I was very happy with StockWiseAuto on Amazon and the service they gave me. Great price! I got it for about one third the price the dealer wanted.Very fast shipping and great customer service.Thanks, Jim"
4,House of Payne DVD Vol. 1,"Received DVD one time. One of the three dvd's had scratches and skipped a couple of time, but overall satisfied with the product."
1,false pretenses,"This is more a review about the shipping policy. It cleary states that this product is shipped APO/FPO. However, when I went to checkout I was told this product does not ship to my address. So if you are APO/FPO looking for fasteners, do not buy from this store."
2,not worth it,Decipher attempt to throw together something on moria ... a bitter disappointment to a beautiful rule system LOTR RPG CODA.
1,not recommend it to anyone!!,"within three days of daily use my face began to suffer a series of uncontrollable eruptions. this never happened before, the truth was very scared so I decided to stop using. if it was not for my skin type or reaación was due to some allergic to one of the compounds of the product, but it was a very bad experience."
1,Will Break immediately.,"I bought two of these, used them in different rooms on completely different lamps. Within weeks they were both burnt out. Useless."
5,Bellissimo!,"This is some of the best tenor singing I have ever heard. Vargas fuses the spontaneous pathos of the great Italianate tenors with a more informed and accurate approach to singing that is contemporary. Unbelievable dynamic shading with beautiful covered head tones. The live sound makes the piano sound *huge* and a bit boomy, but one's ears adjust to it after about a minute. Perhaps that is the reason for the CD's low price, but it just makes this release even more delectable. If you wish that Wunderlich had been reborn in Mexico this is for you!"
3,Bake Away,"These are great muffin pans! You get a great golden crust with these. I wish they were slightly larger in size as I prefer large muffins. Now I have the regular, large and topper versions for my blueberry muffins."
4,Will and Grace Season 7,"I agree that the first maybe 5 or 6 seasons are the best, but season 7 and 8 are pretty good too :)"
1,i agree downhill..........,Yep this show went downhill..pretty much in the middle of season 5. I only own 1-4. None of the shows were very relastic to me. Very slapstick. Will got stupid he was always the sane and smart one. Grace looked like she dont want to even be on the show after her pregnancy. Karen and Jack got dumb and dumberer. The first four seasons were very believeable story lines. I though the series finale was junk to. Just a great show that once was and went on to long with no good storylines.
5,Dodge Viper GTS!,"This car has always been one of my favorites! The exterior design is perfect when it is combined with blue paint and the white stripes.The Viper was one of the most attractive cars on the Need For Speed game and that's where I saw it first. The interior also looked neat with those four black-on-white gauges above the air conditioning vents that measured from left to right: the engine temperature, oil pressure, fuel, and the battery.This blue GTS coupé was released in 1996 to the market. Although it looks great, the car also became notable for its heavy fuel consumption V-10 engine!Burago produced an excellent replica of this great car! Get it now if you like it and place it for display in your room, just like I did!Thanks for taking the time to read!Later..."
2,Good movie for sissies,"It's good for a younger audience but don't let the cover fool you, it's not for hardcore anime fans like ghost in the shell, or ninja scroll. It is better than sailer moon."
1,"Predictably, lacks perspective","An autobiographical account is always a dicey proposition, and in order to succeed, the author requires a certain amount of objectivity, as well as superior writing skills. Unfortunately, this displays neither.I'm not here to bash Nixon politically, but I do have to say that the book comes off as extremely self-serving. Nixon's account of Nixon's life just doesn't come off as honest. I think that when he wrote it, he was still too entrenched in a persona that needed to take public opinion into account. The result is a lot of treacly, ponderous prose that comes off like the presidential equivalent of a Hallmark television special.The one saving grace of the book is that it gives us many little anecdotes that demonstrate the minutiae of the daily life of a President of the United States, and that is indeed interesting. But other than that, there's no reason to pick this up."
5,Great coffee for at home,"This little guy makes a fanastic coffee (more for two than three). Takes a bit of practice to get the perfect cup, but definitely worth it. I recommend placing it on the stovetop on low heat with the lid open to avoid excessive bubbling, which gives the coffee a bit more bitterness.Cleans very easily with just cold water."
3,Handle melts,"I've gone through several of these types of pots over the years and have decided to upgrade to an Alessi 9090 since the handles keep melting, especially now that I purchased a new gas range and the flame is too hot. Love the espresso though!"
5,the little espresso maker that could,So how much do you pay for Starbucks lattes? Probably around $3? This espresso maker + 1 can of Illy coffee + some soy milk= ~$38. You will make back the cost of this product by avoiding S-bucks 12 times and still be able to make more coffee. its wonderful- highly recommend.
1,I received a knock off,The product I was sent was not a real Bialetti even though it came in a Bialetti box. Around the third time that I used it the espresso maker stopped working properly. Only about one cup of very strong disgusting metal tasting coffee came out and the remainder would not come out. I have a one cup Bialetti that I purchased in Italy and the one I got from Amazon does not even compare. The Bialetti from Italy is made of good quality metal and makes great tasting espresso. The Bialetti from Amazon has to be a complete knock off. I returned it as defective.
5,"firm, stable, comfortable","These straps are built to last, and it straps hug your upper arms very comfortably. You're supposed to grip your fingers (usually middle and ring fingers) around the bottom of the hook, for extra stability, but I suspect that if you have very long forearms, you won't be able to since strap length is not adjustable."
5,Geat Purchase and Great Price,"I purchased these to isolate my lower abdominals, but found that I got a complete abdominal workout without having to do a million crunches etc...Also, you have the option of adding ankle weights to increase the difficulty of your workout. I attached my straps thru opposite sides of a 4 ft. chain that runs thru the floor joists in my basement.I would buy these agian. Solid bulid with sturdy rings. Should last me a lifetime with 4 time weekly use easily."
3,"Goalies, goalies, goalies","This book provides a ton of pictures for the reader, as well as it gives some insight about the goaltenders that are photographed. While it is so extensive, I feel it is too extensive, covering almost every netminder that has been in the NHL since the 1980's. I would like to have seen just some of the better players over the years, not just the HOF players, but perhaps a few less than were put in.Also, the pictures are of average quality. Brodeur does have some phenominal shots of goalies over the years, but these pictures are not art quality, rather documentary. I would like to see a book that focuses on the art of goaltending and the people behind it rather than a somewhat plain approach than was taken here. Nonetheless, it still sits on my coffeetable and starts a conversation or two."
1,Rise Of The Stuffed Animals.,"This movie is sooo bad it isn't funny. All you have to watch is the beginning to see that the rampaging animals are pretty much stuffed animals from some poor little kids collection,believe me it's that bad.I only watched a half hour of this super fake movie and I think that's more than enough for any human to endure."
3,Hard to follow,"I found this book above me, and perhaps that is as it should be. It would take an advanced educated theologian to keep up and understand. Thanks"
3,There's no size on this and i think there should be..,"It was too big for my Teacup Chihuahua, i had to go to the craft store & buy the elastic stuff you use for making bracelets and re-do it myself to make it fit her. Once i had done that it WAS adorable on her."
1,Entertaining work of fiction written by a non-vet.,"James Taylor has never set foot in Vietnam but does manage to write as though he knew combat first hand. Even though James Taylor was a mechanic in the Navy and definitely NOT a SEAL he makes you feel as though he was actually there. I found this book to be entertaining at times but obviously a piece of fiction that gets a little too carried away with ""Rambo"" type bravado to be taken seriously."
2,not good,The track started to fall apart before it was fully put together. The train is not much better. If you are considering this because of the price............do yourself a favor and spend the extra money.
1,Plastic parts too flimsy ..,"Life-Like Trains HO Scale Holiday Rails Electric Train Set #8198The train product when opened up from the box looked great and was easy to setup. The instructions and manuals were good.However the train parts, especially the wheels etc. would come off easily and roll off. The parts that join the cars to themselves and the engine are too flimsy.Overall, this is not a solidly built product overall.I am not really happy and hope to return it."
5,Just what I was looking for..,"This train was exactly what we needed for our Christmas Village. It was easy to assemble. And sturdy enough for our 6y old grandson to run without breaking it. He loves to turn it on and run it backwards and forward, fast and slow. He really likes to remove the freight boxes and put items on the train. I would recommend this train to others."
4,It works for me!,"I was looking for a tripod that would just work. This did it for me. Yes, it is cheap, and you do get what you paid for, but if just need a tripod for sporadic use then this is the item for you.I use this tripod with aCasio EX-S200BK 14.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7 inch TFT LCD (Black)and it definitely holds the weight of the camera at the desired position."
3,Good product,"Although I bought this item for my mom for Christmas, because she always uses her camera to take family photos, she rarely uses it mostly because it's not as portable as she would like, but, the item itself if a great tool to get a photo at literally any angle, and it can grip to any material (wood, plastic, etc.)."
1,dont waste your money,"If you want a gorrillapod...get a gorillapod. don't go cheap and get this, it's absolutely horrible. got one, opened it, went to adjust the legs right out of the package and it broke. no camera, no stress, just broke.not worth it"
1,Just broke,"The tripod broke as soon as it was taken out of the box. Moreover, when I put it to hold my Canon T1i it just couldn't handle the weight. Just returned it."
1,Won't support the weight.,I bought this for my Canon 6D and it will not hold the camera up. I bought this specifically because the pic shows it holding a SRL.
1,:(,it does not hold a camera like the pictures shows. they should write the weight limit in the description so you know if it will actually hold a camera like the one in the picture. it doesn't! :( it works with my little nikon cool pix but it won't work with my nikon d5000 since it weighs too much.
5,Grillmaster,"This is my second one. It is a great product. Nothing slips through, it is a perfect size, and it is easy to clean because nothing sticks to it. No serious griller should be without it. Great for veggies, fish, etc...."
1,I wasn't thrilled with this book...,"I had high expectations of this book and was hoping it could tell me some insightful pointers on healthy pre-conceiving, however, the book told me nothing I hadn't already known (don't drink, don't smoke, don't gain or lose too much weight, eat healthy foods). I breezed through the entire contents in 30 minutes and I don't think there is any information included in this book that your OB/GYN wouldn't tell you in your first office visit. I'd recommend looking around for a more comprehensive and informative book."
1,Outdated and alarmist,"I found this book to be easy to read, but severely outdated. The author also took a very alarmist stance that treated pregnancy as an illness. I would have preferred a more balanced view like what I found in Pregnancy for Dummies, which is a very good introductory book. I would NOT recommend this book!"
5,Great CD!,"Pink's ""can't take me home"" is one of the best entire CD's that I have heard in a long time! I met her today and she was really nice, I already had her cd, she signed my cover. She's the real deal. VERY talented and I hope she makes it BIG! I love this CD and I want to see her enjoy all the success in the world!"
4,Pink. A real cutie this one !,"So cute, so good lookin, so raw and unpolished. You can hear here humming voice on Split Personality and you know that this artist has something to tell. The voice has a pain in side, as she realy means what she sings. Some other artists dont, belive me. This album from 2000 is here debut album. The reason why i dont give it a 5 star, is that some tracks is a bit ""unstable"" and doesn't have the quality which surley comes on here next album Missundaztood. Track 4There you go, is one of my favourites. It`s so rytmic that my feets starts to tap hysterically'. But the voice. Everytime she speaks, she has that Janis Joplin inspired voice, which gives that makes me shiver in a good way. Its a pity i can`t take here home. She has star quality all over.Track 12 Hiccup is another winner. A must in youre Pink Collection. The dreamgirl next door, with a voice from another planet, which is difficult to describe in words. Track 10 Stop Falling is a sweetie two."
3,Not bad....,"After I purchased her second CD, I had to get this one. Although I was a bit disapointed, this is not a total waste (especially for a first CD). This CD is basically the standard ""I'm a new singer who has got a big producer ""Babyface"" and I'll let them call the shots so I can get my name out there"" feel. What is more impressive is listening to the quality of Pink's second CD as opposed to this one--it is obvious that on this CD she let others take the reigns--which is to bad."
3,Could have been better.,"When i first heard ""There you go"" and saw Pink, i thought she would blow up. I'll admit she's hot and she's got a voice, but as for the rest of disc, the songs sound formulatic and missing something. The music sounds like a sampling of every R&B hit in the past 3 years. Even the begining of There you Go sounds like No Scrubs. The album could use a few better written songs, and deeper grooves. But Pink's young. Hopefully she's not a one hit wonder."
3,Disappointed Yet Satisfied,"I was blown away by P!NK's ""There You Go"". All its radio play left me hopeful that her debut would be cutting edge but after listening to it, I felt ""Can't Take Me Home"" really didn't have the quality to grab me. The songs had some diversity but nothing like nothing that showed a range of talent. I am interested to see where this album takes her."
4,pink has a great voice,Can't Take Me Home is a great first cd. Pink is a good singer w/ some major talent. This girl tells you how guys sometimes are w/o being mean she is just saying that she doesn't want to be played by her bf and that if he comes crying back to her oh well his loss. I only give it 4 stars b/c after a little while it gets old and boring. But I still would really think that this cd is a must have for anyone.
3,Doesn't remove dog footprints,I bought the product because I read that it worked on removing dog footprints made by the oil on their feet. It does not do that.It does clean up those areas of the floor without dog traffic nicely
3,"Better artwork, but has more bass than U.S. version","This CD version has better artwork than the American version, but I don't believe it sounds as good. It has too much bottom end and bass, so buy the U.S. release instead. Now, if you like more bass, then this might be for you. The new Japanese version has very little bass, so it is your choice. Rock on!"
1,Misinformation,"This book is terrible and cannot be recommended. Many of the things it says are simply wrong, like the opening discussions of 'orders of minuteness'. This book gives a lot of disinformation in attempts to simplify difficult topics, when all that is needed of these topics are clear unthreatening explanations. It does not deserve the popularity it has received for the last century. For a much better book to help a struggling student of introductory calculus, I can to no end highly recommend How to Ace Calculus: The Streetwise Guide by Colin Adams, et al."
2,less than expected,"I believe Martin Gardner was mentioned as having something to do with this book so I thought it would be very good, and someone else said it helped them so much in calculus. I am a calculus teacher and I just don't get much out of it that I think will really help the kids."
5,great book.,"this book is very reader friendly, it is very clear and helpful, I really like the way the book is written and how the writer explains everything in detail."
2,Catskill end grain cutting board,"This board replaces an old cracked edge grain board that I have had for decades. I just couldn't see spending over $100 for a cutting board, but I wanted edge grain to keep my knives sharp, so I spent $26.58 on this one. So glad Boos has competition. (Made in America) OWSFollow up one month later; the board is cracked and warped. It is still usable and my knives are staying sharp. The crack from the outside edge hasn't reached the groove yet and the flex in the board changes directions as I turn the board over. It should be twice as thick. I guess there is no way out of spending the big bucks for quality."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,I bought this less than 6 months and the whole entire thing fell apart. Literally fell completely to pieces. I am hoping that the seller of this item will send me a replacement one for free it is so bad. Until then I will leave this horrible review posted so others are aware.
1,Check the facts at the door...,"I agree with BB. This book requires the reader to agree that black is white, yes means no...there are so many occasions in which the author offers fundamental untruths in order to demonstrate his points that one ends up throwing ones hands in the air in disgust. It is telling that the book one an award from the APSA -- an organization of non-experts. Experts who read this book will be left exasperated. Gagnon has a certain cachet, though, so he probably won't get the reviews he deserves. Bad ones, that is."
1,Waste of time and money,"As previously remarked ""do not buy this. it is a sham. a high school kid could do better with a mid range video camera"".This DVD is waste of time and money. It displays no understanding of Architecture or how to convey Architectural imagery and meaning to the viewer. Some of the buildings appeared to be filmed without the permission or knowledge of the owners and over their neighbors back fence with the background sound of birds and cars. A lot of the images of Schindlers projects could be seen by anyone from the street begging the question, Why this DVD was made? Issues such as light, shade and the quality of the spaces get lost in poor images which are composed at odd, strange angles and lack the perspective composition to explain the space thus depriving the viewer of any idea of what these buildings are like.I wonder if this DVD was really produced to promote Schindlers Biuldings"
1,Unstitched and unglued,"Wallet arrived with stitching undone and easily pulled completely apart when I opened the side slot to investigate further. Parts of it were held together by glue, no stitching."
5,I bought three,I needed a couple wallets for Christmas gifts and saw these. I bought three after reading the reviews. It's the heavy duty magnet clip that allows you to carry more bills than others of this type.
3,Works fine & workmanship is okay,"The adage ""you get what you pay for"" comes into play here. The money clip works fine ... clip holds bills just fine. External pockets are a tad snug but workable. Yhe center pocket is snugger and a bit less convenient as a result. The quality of the leather is commensurate with the cost.So it's serviceable but not polished. At this price it's unfair to expect much more; but I wouldn't complain if it gave me more!'"
3,As advertised,"Shipped fairly quick and when I opened the package, I was pleasantly surprised that everything about it was as advertised. The wallet is nice and compact and in brand new condition. The magnetic clip is a very nice touch and works perfectly. If I were to nitpick, I would say card pockets were a little snug for my taste. However, that could just be that it's genuine leather and will stretch over time. Also, if it had a slightly thinner profile, it would get another star from me."
3,Serves its purpose,"This is not high quality but it does what it's supposed to do and it looks nicer than it is. If you just need a money clip because a wallet is too big and youre not loking for anything too fancy, this is it."
1,Not what I thought I bought.,This item NEVER said in the discription that it was a MAGNETIC money clip. It was not at all what I wanted. Waste of money and false advertising.
4,Is Harry Really Mad?,"Harry's Mad, a breath taking animal fantasy, by a clever author, Dick King-smith is a tremendous tale. Harry is a young fun-loving boy who received an intelligent, gray, African parrot from his Great-Uncle George who passed away. Madison, or Mad for short, is a strange parrot that can talk and provide help like no other bird, but strangers can't hear this secret or Mad is in trouble. Harry, the owner of this amazing bird, worries when Mad is stolen and kidnapped by a burglar. Harry and his parents send out descriptions in the newspaper and try many things. Nobody knows what happened until...This book takes place in a variety of places in London, Harry's house, White Hart Lane, and Trafalgar Square. I would definitely recommend this perfect parrot book any time. It is full of good descriptions and has funny and smart scenes."
1,Boring,"I thought the video would show them doing the actual bike riding, as in helmet cams or the such but nope.The camera men had to often hunt down the bikers as they didn't take cellphones/walkie talkies with them (cells wouldn't work in most areas I'm sure).Extremely boring video. Had high hopes."
2,Boring,"Please, do yourself a favour and do not read this book. Most of the time it's extremly boring! The only reason I gave this book a 2 was because I liked the ending."
5,Being the Best!,I consider 'Lets have Healthy Children' to be one of the most valuable books in the world. Adelle teaches us how to insure our children reach their full genetic potential. The proof is in the putting and you should see my two children that were Adelle Davis babies. Both are well above average intellegence as well as extra healthy and beautiful. Now we start the next generation of Adelle Davis babies in our family. I must find a copy of this book to pass along so my new grandbaby can be the best she can be.
3,Too short,"This video is ok. It lacks a few videos though. Wheres ""The Dirt Road"", and ""Cafe on the Corner""? They could have included them in it. It may have cost more, but I'd buy it anyhow. The shortness of this video is why it gets three stars. Great group, ok video."
4,Good Replacement Tips for Park Chain Breaker Tool,"I bought a new Park Tool chain breaker. The first day that I had it, one of my boys broke the tip. At first I thought that I would have to buy another new tool, until I looked into the tool on the Park Tool website and discovered that the tips were replaceable. I decided to check to see if the tip were available through Amazon, since I use their Prime shipping service. And sure enough Amazon had them. I gave the tips only 4 stars because it is a great idea that they are replaceable, but we broke one the first time we used the tool."
2,Save your money on this one,"If you're a big Maryam D'Abo fan (like me), this is THE movie to see, since she appears au naturel a lot. If not, trust me, save your money on this one: a bigger bomb you won't be able to find! The two stars are only for gorgeous Ms. D'Abo sake; otherwise you'll never forgive yourself for spending two hours of your valuable lifetime watching this trash, not to mention your hard earned money buying it!"
3,Salt by Isabel Zuber,Very interesting book. Speaks to the rise and fall of prosperity and how we set our priorities as viewed through the lives of the characters!? Historical fiction.
2,"IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS NOTHING...","In the beginning, there was nothing. We can clearly see, listening to this album, how TRIUMPH progressed afterwards..."
2,You had to be there.,"This sounded great to me in 1981. It sounds pretty silly now, though. Maybe it was the booze."
3,"Solid Foster, but not as good as predecessors","I enjoyed this book (it is the third book of a trilogy with Phylogenesis and Dirge as the first two), but I found it the weak sister of the group. Foster is certainly prolific, and I enjoy almost all of his work, but I get the impression that he has done so many Pip/Flinx and Humanx Commonwealth books by now he could (and sometimes does) write them in his sleep. I enjoyed some of the prequel tie-ins written into this series (the Tse-Mallory/Zenzuzex linkage introduced in his early book Tar-Aiym Krang is explicated in this series), and the book is written in Foster's usual light but quickly flowing style, but there isn't much new here. Go back to the earlier Flinx and Commonwealth novels for Foster at this best."
1,dangerous---hook broke off and mobile fell on baby,"We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day!Like I said before, other than this, it has been great."
4,Best 20 dollars I spent today!,"This flick is fast paced and really shows off, Slaters ability. The music is quick and hip, great tape to get you in the mood for your own excursion."
4,"A thoroughly enjoyable,multifacted read","I have read this book twice; once during summer holidays and then again this past weekend, and I enjoyed it in a different way very much each time. There is a greater maturity in the work than before; Lentz has learned to use dialogue effectively and with good wit, especially with the difficult dialect and idiom of places as diametrically opposed as Bayou Cajun country and Boston, Massachusetts are. His capture of local colour really washes well; I thoroughly like the story line, but even moreso the underlying, gurgling innuendo and hidden asides. The setting in New Orleans works really well too, and moves the book along."
5,Precioso,"La calidad del producto es muy buena, el tamaño del mismo es enorme, es un producto realmente recomendable, sin dudas el mejor"
4,So far so good,"This seems to be a good product. It's attractive, functional and provides more room for the USPS delivery person. Not sure how it will stand up over the long haul."
1,"horrible, ...like bad troma bad","Just finished watching ""Hanger"". was a complete waste. badly acted. badly written (I bet that there was no script and the ""actors"" were improving(badly)). This has to be the most poorly edited film I've ever seen. Some pointless scenes go on for too long while others cut MID-SENTENCE to go to another scene also joined MID-SENTENCE. seriously, someone got paid for this. And to have to where with all to want to put your name in the credits for this; simply more shocking than the movie itself. Very little gore, for some reason the camera is never at the right angle to capture the violence or it's eluded to in some convoluted manner i.e. shadows on a wall (which they didn't get right either as the viewer can plainly tell by the SIZE of the shadows that the persons are not even near each other to preform what is being depicted.)That's all the time I'll waste here, marking this whole production team off my projected movie watching que......"
2,Disappointed,"After recently watching Gutterballs, appreciating the gore, and overall finding it to be an enjoyable film I decided to order Hanger. Although most of the other reviews regarding this film were mixed, I truly had an open mind and semi-high hopes with it, due to the directors previous work, however it really was a let down. The acting was really bad, and while there were some scenes which were graphic, for the most part it just came across as stupid. What was probably most upsetting is that you don't feel any connection/sympathy toward any of the characters, which made Hanger very hard to sit through. Very boring, unfortunately. If you are looking for raunchy/entertaining/good gore check out gutterballs... If your looking for extreme horror I would suggest A Serbian Film, and Martyrs."
1,'Hanger' Deserves To Be Hanged,"Hanger is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Its only redeeming quality is the rather abundant nudity. Other than that, it's a badly scripted and acted piece of junk. I'm not easily offended, but there were moments in this ""film"" that disgusted me. I can't believe this was directed by Ryan Nicholson, who directed the ultra-gory funfest Gutterballs. That was one of my favorite movies of 2008. And Hanger is one of my least favorite movies of this year or any other. Skip it."
1,Absolute JUNK!!,Dont waste your money nor time watching this awful rotten film. There really is no point to it except to try to disgust you which it doesnt even do!! 90 minutes of pointless stupid scenes that go nowhere. Avoid this trash at all costs!!
2,Not Triumph's best effort,"Listenable, at best. While hard core Triumph fans will probably appreciate this, it doesn't hold a candle to their best work. Sure, there's good music here, and it deserves to be in print, but to experience undiluted Triump, purchase 'Allied Forces', 'Never Surrender, 'Just A Game' or their superior ""Thunder Seven"""
5,Triumph: Progressions of Power,I found out about this band in 1978. These guys were a great band. Their style of music was what Rock N Roll was built on. They were the ultimate Rock N Roll Machine.
2,It's GREAT (not really)!!!,"When I first saw that they were going to sell this on the Neopets site, I wanted to get one of them, they looked very interesting and fun. But as soon as I got it, I didn't like it so much. First, its head stopped functioning for more than three times and I had to shake and twist the head around a bit to get it moving again. It doesn't do much and I don't think that there are as many as 30 sounds, since I kept getting those same sounds over and over. Plus, it's pretty noisy, and you can hear it a room away, which is sort of annoying. Overall, I think that this toy is boring and a bit annoying, so only buy this if you're a collector or a Kougra/Neopets fan."
3,It's hard to remix a song you got right the first time but long live Ahmad,I both grew up an listened to this legendary jam but it sounded so different not to put down Ahmaed because we all change as we get older either way no matter how I felt I guess the kids need to grasp the same feeling that this jam makes any O.G. feel when it first came out so that being said purchase it you wont regret it because we all grow old an it's nice having a jam that takes us down memory lane
5,it works!!!,I bought this ab wheel like 2 1/2 weeks ago. so far it has worked for me.My arms and abs look better already and i hope to get better results in a few more weeks. i would recommend this product.
5,Great Product!!,This item the Dual Wheel really works my abs and also I notices my triceps and upper back get a workout too. With this Dual Ab Wheel I can feel and see my core is getting stronger and the abs are not showing.lol. Easy to assemble out of the box and look and feel very sturdy and strong. Great product.
3,Just OK product.... The grip is pretty bad though,"The assembly is kind of difficult but not impossible. The product itself seems to be good and durable. Not sure about the the results yet. Be sure you exercise as directed since is really easy hurt yourself doing this. Another thing is that you have to be in good shape to begin working out with this or any other wheel. The grip is pretty bad, I have to use my gloves every time because if I don't my hands get really soar."
3,Dillon's review,I am using this product along with the Ab Lounge. I find this does more to help strengthen the upper arms and shoulders but does work on some lower areas of the Abs. I think this is a very easy and inexpensive product that is beneficial for everyone that decides to us it.
2,tough on hands,"This is not a bad product for the price but money aside, it is tough on the hands and you have to be in extra good shape to use it. I find that you can use it on a sturdy table while sitting and it is a lot less strenuous. You really should use a light pair of leather gloves when using it however. You must be in advanced condiditon to even start using this on the floor."
3,so far so good,"Only used it a couple of times, there's not much to it. I wish the instructions on safe posture were clearer. They have 2 ""wrong way"" illustrations and 1 ""right way"" but it's hard to tell the difference. The written instructions help, but I think they could have done a better job of making it clearer. Other than that, no problems."
5,Ab wheel,This ab wheel is really good if you juzt want to stay in your room and work it out your muscle....its really tone my abs....great value...fast delivery...thats what i like..
4,Surprising Workout,"Gives you a good ab workout, however I would recommend kneeling on a towel/yoga mat. And do read the brochure on correct posture, else you may suffer back soreness after using.The only reason this did not get 5 stars:--Grip could be more comfortable"
3,Gets the job done...,Assembly is a real work out my gosh i had to spray the handle with wd40 to get the foam grip on... my gosh it was difficult to put on... but after thats over its a pretty good concept... the workout does seem promising based on after effects... the wheel is a bit shaky but that can be dealt with... overall an okay buy...
1,Waste,You want core strength? Do L-sits. Can't do L-sits just lift your legs as high as you can. Pace yourself. Sore abs does not mean strong abs. The best workouts can be done with your own body weight not this useless junk the the Fitness community dumps on society.
4,nice,"Got it at a great price. Nice burn from using it. I don't know that 2 wheels makes it better, but it does the job.Only gripe was that it was almost impossible to put the foam handle on over the metal bar, that was a workout by itself, had to use all knowledge of physics and all brute strength in fingers to get job done."
5,It does the job,"I've been using this for a week or more.It does the job, and the price was good. That's about it.5 stars cus it does the job"
3,Valeo Ab Wheel,"A lot smaller than I had anticipated, which makes me a little nervous that the handle might slip off after using it for some time, but it does seem durable. Also the wheel itself hard, so if youre using it on gym/yoga mats it will likely mark or tear them up."
2,Who invented this!!!,"This is not for beginners, u have to be physically trained, the grip is horrible. Ur rolling down trying ur hardest to get back up.. u have to be really physically train. I have a stomach thats far from abeffic, its better u get a mcdavid waist trimmer or plastic wrap and do some ab workout.. If u do get to roll back up and down like ur doing a push up then good for u, most likely u will get some abs, once again its not for begginers, u have to be trained to work this. Whoever invented this didn't think of someone like me!!"
4,not bad for abs for price,You have to be patient and work at least 3-4 times a week. Also do something else because Ab wheel alone won't do it. I like the product for the price & installation was piece of cake. not bad to have something else apart from regular exercise.
4,Let's you know you need it,"I had never used an exercising device like this before. Boy I really needed to go slowly to start with as I needed it more than I realized. I have knees that need coddling so I kneel on a gel mat. If you have bad knees you will need to think about what you are going to kneel on. Your body rolls over your knees in this exercise.I like it a lot and I am definitely benefiting from using it. It wasn't expensive, it doesn't take up much room and helps.Its construction is okay, but considering how inexpensive it was I think it delivers dollar value."
2,Covers fell off immediately,"The paper is fine, but the spiral binding is of poor quality. The front and back cover of the book fell off in the first five minutes of use."
3,A Flawed but Relevant Stab at Biography,"This tome purports to explain why GWB is a talented leader of the American people and the world.In fact, it demonstrates conclusively that the American people suffered a collective fit of hallucination when they voted this singularly incompetent man into office.The book has some nice information about Crawford, Texas and the Bush's dogs -- but it does not tell us anything about the psychology of the Boy Emperor. Perhaps this is becuase the BE has no particular psychological nuance to display? Perhaps.Leadership, as Fred Nietzsche once opined, is about breaking the rules when others think that rule breaking would be a mistake.Bush's ""leadership,"" as noted by the author, consists of learning the rules and efficiently applying them with charm and gingerly worded disinformation. Then again, maybe the book isn't half bad. I learned how to be manipualtive and nice at the same time."
1,Casta is no gipsy at all....,"I have listened to many guitarist, but casta I expected more from u, but u let me down. This album was your first and last album in my opinion. Tedious rhytm and boring voices. Guitar palying is way off , and doesnot accompany the singers. If you really want a nice spanish guitar cds, check my reviews. Casta's cd will give u a big disappointment if u buy. Casta tries to join guitar with spanish mood and latin percussion, but he fails. I have nothing against casta, he may be a good person as his label comapny alula records says, but his music is very weak, and gipsies won't like this album at all. Plz, donot call your self gipsy. The album has some tracks that you will hate it, lake of talent and passion. Casta feels like gipsy, but real gipsy's music comes from heart and passions. Casta has to improve his style and music. Work hard Casta, you can do it."
1,Shocking,"Having just purchased this recording, I can't help but wonder HOW did Scott's voice evolve from this sugary, bubble gum style on this CD to the fine voice he currently possesses. The CD on Amazon lists 27 titles but only the first thirteen are on this CD, but then enough IS enough. It is amazingly hard to believe that he went on to record anything ever again but then this is only MY opinion. I have heard better on American Idol but it does not distract from his later works, only mystifies!"
2,Dumb Stuff.,"This book is a very poor piece of literature. A lot of the facts that the author says are false are true, and the author is wrong saying that they are false. There are many inaccuracies. Some of these are very much proven facts that the author claims are wrong. I believe it just the author giving his opinion on the things from what he believes to be true. Some of them on the other hand are false."
5,"Thank You, Kenny!",I bought 'Everywhere We Go' the day it was released. It is the one CD I have yet to grow tired of. It lifts me when I'm at my lowest. THANK YOU KENNY! You are truly a gift.
2,very misled!,"I dont do a lot of reviews, but first off, i buy a lot of compilations to get a feel for some stuff i may otherwise hear, and thats how i heard the song under the black ravens wings. i thought wow, this is pretty good, a little different than other black metal that i was hearing, so i found the cd and bought it. big mistake. the only song i could stomach through, was the one on the compilation. the rest was not good, and im being nice here, i dont like to bash someones music. i still listen to black raven sometimes, but i got rid of the cd pretty quick. i advise to listen to all the songs and then buy what you like."
5,"Great song, great CD","This is a fun song . . . the lp/movie version has that '60s pop sound that works great with an Austin Powers movie. The Calderone Club Mix takes a different, dance-oriented, more contemporary approach that is equally involving. A good song can wear multiple faces successfully.The Calderone Radio Mix is just a shorter version of the Club Mix.If I had a complaint, my only one would be that I wish there were more mixes included, as someone else mentioned. Other than that, I think this is a worthy addition to your collection."
1,Awful song,Her singing is really crappy on this song. And the lyrics aren't very catchy or interesting. Stay away from this one.
1,Rather boring I must say.,"There is nothing in this single that hasn't been done before. Just another trivial pop song, from one of the most overrated female performers."
2,Dèjá vu all over again,"In 1998, Madonna covered herself. This year, she's going dèjá vu all over again. Hope you know what I'm talking about because she, Michael Jackson, Jennifer López, and Ricky Martin are praised way too damn much for their throwing off of their clothes just to be the most popular stunts in history while decent people like Céline Dion, Phil Collins, and Andrea Bocelli get treated like s**t. She can't sing. She must go. No offense to you fans who don't care. I'm just expressing my opinions.Goodbye for now."
3,Missing Links,"To Wed a Viscount by Adrienne BassoOnce I got into the book this is a decent enough read. It is high in sensuality and low on plot. Several plot points were introduced that weren't followed through, and while I liked both the hero and the heroine, they weren't actually developed enough for me to become emotionally attached to either of them. This book seemed to me to just be missing vital information for the plot to progress as it should."
2,What a Bummer,"When I wanted to stop reading this book, I already had read half of it and kept plodding through it, waiting for it to get better. This definitely is not an unlifting book. Each chapter is spent on members and close friends of this Southern Family and their own personal histories up to the time their brother, friend, or father dies--and how they react or don't react to his death. What I found unbelievable is how this dead man's 3 year old son supposedly acts. What three year old thinks in full paragraphs? Can there really people that many dysfunctional people all in one family?"
4,so cute!,"I love grasshoppers and went on a search for a cute stuffed grasshopper I could put up on my shelf. This one fit the bill. When it arrived for Christmas, my husband, family, and I couldn't stop playing with it because of the cute little noise that it made!!"
5,Right behind the Big Three in the Second Viennese School,"Beautifully recorded expressionist works. Wellesz was a fine composer affiliated with the big three (Schoenberg, Berg, Webern) but not as individualistic in what he achieved in the early atonal period. If you love that recognizably Second Viennese School sound, though, you want to know his music."
4,Dreaming the Divine,"This wasn't too bad. It suffers from being on the simplistic side, which might be Cunningham's way of trying to keep it down to earth for anyone to understand. He offers up a good overview of Sacred Dreaming from several different cultures, techniques, rites and spells.It's worth considering to supplement any other Dream Books you might have or a place to get started."
3,"An engaging story, but the ending and characterzation struggle","The ending was a let down. Saul brings the reader to believe on thing throughout the plot, but as revealed toward the end, the truth of the matter is different. However, the setting of Prairie Bend was captivating and realistic. Some characters such as Amos were believable, but others such as Janet and Michael were annoyingly two-dimensional. I found it hard to identify or root for any characters in this novel. However, Nathaniel was written well and the pacing was fast. There are several mysteries revealed with crafty subtlety throughout. I found that I needed to keep reading, especially past page 150. I would give Nathaniel 3 1/2 stars if I could."
4,Legend comes to life in Prarie Bend,"Nathaniel, the truculent myth that has the residents of sleepy Prarie Bend whispering his name for 100 years asserts his powers vicariously through young Michael Hall. Family secrets abound and intertwine to hold the raeder spellbound, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Saul drops the other shoe with a wallop, delving into macabre with deft strokes of the pen. A poignant story of rural life peppered with anomoly"
3,"fun, pretty and Breakable","This tea set is very cute, and my own kids plus boys and girls who come over all love it. The colors are great, and the perfect size. They also like the ""tink-tink"" sound of the porcelain.However, we are only a few months into owning it, and already two pieces have broken and two more plates have chipped. I don't think it will last much longer at my house.Since the price was great, I'm not sorry I bought it. But if you have a more conscientious kid who loves to play kitchen, this is a great inexpensive set."
5,Great fun,"I bought this for the younger of my two daughters (she's two). I was nervous about her banging it around in play, and she has PLAYED with it. She loves it. Astonishingly enough she's not broken it yet. She has hit it the pieces pretty hard but so far it's still intact. A testament to it's durability!We've had a few tea parties with cake and ""lemonade"" tea. Fun for everyone! I ended up getting a tin tea setSummer Bugs Tin Tea Setbecause I was driving myself crazy with the clanking of the dishes. We use this as the ""good china"" set, for those special tea parties.A really great little tea set for any kid!"
4,darling tea set,"I gave this set to my daughter for her two year birthday. She immediately wanted to play with it and I got a lot of compliments on how ""cute"" it is from the other people at the party. She's asked to play with it a number of times since her party and has had fun having a ""tea party"" with the dog :-) Unfortunately, she dropped one of the cups on our tile floor right away and it shattered. My bad for not paying attention. Otherwise, she has been clinking the dishes around with each other on the carpeted floor and they've held up pretty well."
4,Good for the absolute beginner,Michael Morgenstern has written a valuable book here for males whose experiences of sex have not hitherto involved women but now want them to. My only quibble is that this might be a niche market.
4,A true classic.,"This book is one of the most unique books you'll ever read whether you are an ""Orwellian"" or not. This book represents any government system, and not just a fascist or communist regime as some suggest. George Orwell tells the story of a group of animals that hear a message to rise up against the humans. As they rise up, the pigs become the power hungry on the quest to rise up from their oppression. The pigs take advantage of their power, and they also betray their own rules.This book could say that one has to be a true saint for communism to work effectively, but in my opinion it states that if you give anyone power over another group of people, you will discover that we do not differ from the pigs in this novel.This is a true classic that everyone should read and feel inspired by. If you haven't read this, you don't know what you're missing."
4,Animal Farm,"This book gives you an excitment. Together you and the animals can experiance a story filled with suspense, thrill and interest.Some important animals stand out from the other animals.Others just sit around in the story. Although the last two pages are boring, I still reccomend it. The ending will give you feelings of some of the bad things that are happening in our lives. The utopian society the animals try to create turns into monstorous problems. A nine fits this book for the suspense with interest and excitement. This book is meant for 6th graders and up because it has a true meaning of life now and in the future."
2,Animal Farm,animal farm was a decent book i mean i would probably recomend it to some people but not ot all it gets boring at times but all and all it is a good book.
1,This is the worst book I have ever read.,"This book was terible. I was forced into reading this book in school. Which is no surprise, this is exactly the kind of book our government wants to force people to read, so they hand it to schools, and try to force us to read it. This book was written by a insane man named George Orwell, who hated society, and displayed that by bashing humanity, and making people look like lower lifeforms than animals. He used pigs to potray govermnent officials (which isn't a bad choice if you ask me), horses for hard working people, dogs as SS troops, etc... Throught this entire book, he constantly tries to show that humans are sick people, that will corrupt no matter what happens. To be honest I think this man is crazy and needs to be locked up."
1,horrible,i had to read this book for my ninth grade english class. i would have to say that it is one of the worst books i have ever read. There may be some things that relate to things that were going on in that time period7 but if i hadnt been told that by my english teacher then i would have had no idea. no one wants to hear about pigs taking over a farm and then wearing human clothes and beimg in their house. I just dont understand the point of this book
5,Not just for animal lovers!,"Something the revolution brings forth new types of crooks. If people don't pay attention to what their elected leaders are doing once they are elected, then like some of the characters in the book they will be looking on the outside at people on the inside having a good time at their expense.R HemingwayPast Twilight"
3,Good book!,The book is well written and I like it. But I think that not everyone will like the book-it is more about people having a revolution and people gaining power than about animals living on a farm. When I read the book I liked the comparison between animals and human beings. The behavior of the animals in the book shows the typical behavior of Man.
3,my review,"I thought this book was very interesting. I liked how all the animals came together to defeat Mr. Jones, but I didn't like it how the animals were able to talk to humans. I thought that was going a little overboard. But I thought it was cool the way the animals, though devistated, pulled through everything with hope and courage. I liked it how so many bad things, like how the windmill that they had worked so hard on was destroyed twice, happened to them, but they kept their heads high, and just kept rebuilding it.All in all, I thought it was okay, and would only recommend it to people that like fiction."
3,Wonderful satire and allegory on the Bolshevic Revolution,"Orwell does a wonderful job of writing a simple allegory on the Bolshevic Revolution of the early 1900's. It was very simple to understand and the idea of making the setting at a farm was great. However, I felt it was a bit unchallenging for my high school freshman honors english class."
2,Ludicrously fictictional yet fun to read.,"George Orwell's novel was in fact an expression of his views towards totalitarianism, i.e. a satire. However because the storyline was so insanely bizarre in and of itself, it became impossible for the reader to tell when the events of the novel had an underlying message and when they didn't. It was easy to pick up, and the anctics of the animals made it a book that the reader wanted to finish, but Orwell's subtly expressed views of totalitarianism were totally overshadowed and ignored as the reader incessantly wonders, "" Am I missing something here?"""
2,Politically great; Realistically no,"I found that reading Animal Farm was extremely boring. According to politics it was dead on, but the way Orwell chose to illistrate his views was obserd. Pigs climbing on ladders painting, animals talking, and; ""all animals are equal, but some are more equal."" That is just plain stupid. Please someone tell me how to be more equal if everyone is already equal.I would never ask anyone to read this book. 1984 is a much better work than Animal Farm."
5,Still holds up...,Great book and subject matter that is still so applicable today. It si a quick read but really gets your brain working. I could read this over and over. Right up there with To Kill a Mockingbird in my opinion as far as classics go.
5,great story,"I read the Animal Farm as a junior is high school. I bought this copy for a friend for Christmas, as she has never read it. I hope this is still required reading in high school, but unfortunately, that is doubtful. If anyone wants a perfect look at our current political system, they need look no further than the pages of Orwell's masterpiece, and classic."
1,I wish I had read the reviews -- teeny tiny print!,I didn't read the reviews either -- thinking they would be about content. This book shouldn't even be offered on Amazon. Am returning.
1,The print is so small it's unreadable - Do not buy,"The font size in this book must be 5 or 6. I have 20/20 vision and it is difficult to read, actually hurts after a few pages. I have no idea why someone would pring a book with such a small font.Do NOT buy this version of the book."
5,um help please,i need to read this for school but i dont know how good it is i am not sure whether i should buy it or borrow iti also wanted to know exactly howthis book effects youso if you can tell me i would apprciate itreply to my post i will be eagerly waiting
5,Animal Farm is off the HEEZY,"What's crackulating? I thought Animal Farm was the best book I've read this year! I especially liked the fact that it was a metaphor for the human condition, and that while it specifically spoofed the Communist Revolution in Russia, elements of Squealer and Napoleon can be seen in our own George W. Bush. I also appreciated the characters of Boxer, Benjamin and Clover, but I thought the sheep were annoying with their continuous bleating. Lastly, I appreciated the overall message at the end of the book: that power corrupts all. In conclusion, I thought this to be a fine read for all.Peace Out,The Waterboy"
5,Do not classify this book!,Too many readers have stated that this book is irrelevant now that the Russian revolution is over. But you should realize that the Russian revolution has no bearing on this material whatsoever. So what if it is modeled after real persons? The importance of this book comes from its lessons about the danger of power and manipulation and corruption. It is more relative now than ever.
5,Don't Let the Title Fool You,"I was asigned this book to read during the summer for school, and at first I thought it would be ridiculous. A book about animals taking over a farm? Boring. Well, it wasn't. It was a tremendous book, and I think I'll read it again just for fun. A story about how power can drive an animal, or a person, to do things that they'd never think of doing. A dispute between leaders and the ruining of a utopian dream. This book covers the aspects of the things that can destroy our own society, and teaches you a great lesson at the end. This book is in a class of its own."
4,Animal Farm,"Animal Farm was a alright book, but it could have been better. It got a little boring at times and sometimes you couldn't understand what the charaters were talking about other than that it was a good book. I over-all enjoyed the book."
2,Animal Farm By: Meagan Frye,"Animal Farm, a very intriguing novel by George Orwell, is one that I highly suggest to anyone who wants to read such a meaningful book. In an essence, it represents our world in the early 1940's, when World War II was in full swing. In this book, animals represent different human charcters and different characteristics people exhibit through their actions of war and tyranny. Napoleon, the pig that overthrew Snowball, symbolizes a dictator and represents a sort of dictatorship, like Adolf Hitler. Napoleon has a way, like Hitler, to brainwash his people to think he is the best. This book really got my wheels turning. This is an outstanding book for anyone who chooses to read it, so why are you waiting? Go read it today!"
2,It was plain and simply boring!,Those animals were very stupid. They didn't know what they wanted. Throughout the book they were changing the rules. By reading the first page you could already tell that there type of government was going to fail. Stupid ending.
3,Animal Farm,"The seller said the book was in like new condition. However, the condition of the book was overstated in my opinion. The book was also shipped after the date range the seller provided."
5,Excellent Book,Entertaining and very insightful. Quick read and will keep you hooked right up till the end.
4,School Book Requirement,This was a school book requirement that I found cheaper on amazon than purchasing at the local book store.
4,Social principles exposed in a 'once removed' story,"Because the animals occupy key stage in this metaphorical/symbolic story of social power versus social corruption, it removes the defense barriers-- so principles stand out in the end. If Orwell had featured humans for this message--it would have sidetracked us from the issue.Animal Farm is almost a sosphisticated fairy tale with a powerful moral value; making its greatest power social statements made via animal's lives."
3,It is a nice book to read,There is a farm called Manor farm. On that farm there is a guy called Mr.Jones. One night he for got to feed the aniamls.The animals kicked down the fence and drove the humans out. The animals are now working as humans. The animals on the Manor farm did not like each other. They always had a commander on the farm as a leader to lead them. The pig were first to lead them. Then Napoleon anther pig would be able to take to the humans.I would tell you that Animal farm is a great book if you like to read about farm animals. Their job in the book is like it is on a farm. The horses work to pull equipment and the cows give the milk. The animals can be like humans.There wasn't much about the book I didn't like. It is not really like any other book I've read recently.
3,A Quick summary ---- ! ! ! !,A symbolic book about a revoloution which ends to misery with an impressive writing and from a British writer.
5,Standing Ovation,"You don't need a thirteen year old reader to tell you that this book is a masterpiece.Orwell's imaginative and creative mind is well displayed in this brilliant novel portraying modern government and human characteristics. The symbols in the book are so rich. Propaganda, intelligence, gullibility... all very carefully molded in the book.Again, Standing Ovation for author George Orwell for hitting a home run with literature."
5,my favorite book,"Animal Farm is my favorite book in the whole world. I have read it at least four times --- each time in one sitting, because it is a very easy book to read, and once I start it, I cannot put it down. The first time I read it, I was in the 7th grade. I was an excellent student in school, but I did not like to read, because virtually all the books written for children and young adults that I had ever been assigned or offered in school I found to be insipid and boring. Imagine when I began reading Animal Farm and I suddenly discovered that not all books are like that, that books can be GREAT! What an eye opener."
3,Interesting political satire,"Animal Farm is a well written and interesting political satire. Orwell has fullfilled his job to illustrate the developement of dictatorship by giving animals the characters of humans. The novel isn't just a story of some animals living on a farm, their characters refer to real existing humans who lived under the Soviet Communism. The allegory may give away information about the further process and the developement may be obvious sometimes, but the thoughts and feelings of the animals prevent the novel from getting boring. Furthermore there are still some unexpected incidents, i.e. Boxer's death. All in all, Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" is a proclamation against dictatorship and a proclamation for liberty. I think that's very topical considering that the book was published in 1945."
5,"Great book, a real page turner","I had to do an over the summer report on this book, i coulnt put it down. i read it 3 times, its a great book!"
4,"Four legs good, TWO legs BAD!","This was a very powerful book.... It is able to be connected with real life so well that it was kinda scary. An important thing to realize about this book is that when Orwell calls it a ""Fairy Tale,"" it is just that. I read this book for a summer reading project and I am having trouble catching the symbolism and other devices in the story. Beside that flaw I really enjoyed it. It is fun to go from an in-depth novel to a quick fairy tale. A real good summer read!"
5,Welcome to the Pig Pin,"A book that needs no introduction: Animal Farm by George Orwell. It's a short read, maybe 2 or 3 hours, but has more substance than probably any book of that length ever written. It deals directly with the idea of civilization, what it is, and more importantly what it should be. While the story certainly deals directly with Communism and Totalitarianism, and might I add in a very entertaining way, Orwell was clever enough to point out that it is the sheep of any civilization who yield the most power; unfortunately they usually aren't smart enough to use this to their advantage. After reading Animal Farm it is not uncommon when watching the news to suddenly see every political move as an action by the pigs and every victory for the sheep as a leap over a fence into despair. Ironically, this is one of the best books on human sociology ever written and I highly recommend that you read it."
1,Oh my goodness----just... No,"I personally hated this book. I found it thouroughly boring it's tone was intolerqbly bleak and epressing--and poor Boxer! This book was such a bummer. I highly suggest AGAINST reading this book. I'm sure some people enjoyed, but most of my English class and I disliked it. I'm sure the author was a wonderful person, but this was just not a good book. Read something happier like, oh I don't know, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It's amd excellent read, and with the Holidays coming up, everyone wants to feel happy."
5,You can see them little piggies (with their piggie wives)!,"This is THE edition to own of Orwell's classic (and haunting) ""fairy story"". Not only Ralph Steadman's vitriolic pen is masterfully honed to the book's wit, mood and characters, the editors have also included an essay, by Orwell as well, about the fredom of the press, which in my opinion is worth the price of the book alone. Buy it and read it at once, and for chrissake, don't even think of skipping this book by watching its dreadful film versions!"
3,great book,Oh the horror! This book is a truly great depiction of why Communism Only works IN THEORY and not in reality. People and apparently animals too get deranged with power! Talk about animal instincts!
5,It was an awesome book!!,I recommend this book to everyone! It was great. I love the way George Orwell explains the bad things about totalitarianism. My favorite character is Boxer. But I am a vegetarian. READ THIS BOOK!!!!
4,Worth to be read - If only to have learned about it!,"I had to read Animal Farm for school. But anyway it very quickly managed to catch my interest. Named a children's book it also holds a lot of entertainment for grown-ups. Told is the story of the animals who live on Manor Farm suffering under the tyranny of their owner, Mr. Jones. One day they decide to throw him out and rule by themselves. But Animal Farm is not only a fairy story: It is a political allegory on Russia and the 1917 Revolution. Orwell, a strict enemy of Soviet Communism, makes skillful use of rethorical devices and hidden meanings to persuade the reader of his opinion. Readers of Orwell's later work 1984 will probably miss a bit of the visionary and philosopher that he turned out to be. Considered today Animal Farm is directed to the past, while 1984 shows a possible future. But anyway Animal Farm is worth reading, if only to have learned about it."
4,It was pretty good,I was assigned this book by my literature teacher about a week ago and finished it a while ago. It was pretty good and in no parts was it boring or off subject. The only thing I have to say about this is that the ending could have been a bit better. It was good but ould have been a little bit better.
4,Brillient Read!,"I had to read this book in High School. And while I statred out not liking it, it grew on mw and upon reflection I have to agree that it is in fact a master piece. It's the ultimate book for suspending disbelief. This is a story to get lost in and appreciate the social comentary."
5,How did he know?,I have now read this book twice. The first time was as an economics student pre the 1994 (South African) elections (and looking forward to the revolution). Reading the book again in 2012 I had to keep reminding myself that this is not a historical account of the ANC's first 15 years in office. Sorry South Africa we should have listened to history and not have been so romantically blind.
5,The truth about us,"This masterpiece of Orwell is showing us the whole truth about politics and society. Forget the good ideas, the brilliant political theories. In democracy, monarchy or in a dictatorship. In capitalism or in communism( indeed the best theory), the Napoleon-pigs will win and the sheeps will follow. This isn't a nice children book, it's hard stuff, but you have to read it!"
5,"Don't trust nobody, not even your closest friend.","Animal is probably the greatest book I've ever read. The characters in the book are as cruel and evil as the people in our government. Many of the characters remind me of certain government figures in the U.S. This book gives a perfect example of what our government is like. If you understand this book, you will understand how our government was somewhat started. George Orwell get's eight thumbs up for creating a story for us that is so real in different ways. If you've never read Animal Farm by George Orwell, I very strongly suggest you do."
3,Animal Farm,"I actually thought this book was very well written and thought out. I even enjoyed it although I wasn't sure at first. I cannot recommend it to anyone though, unless you really know what you're getting yourself into."
1,Cards are all the same.,"The game I played as a kid has pictures of the various grains on the cards. This game has the same picture on all the cards with the grains written on them. It's like have a deck of cards that all have the ace of spades printed on them with something like ""Jack of Clubs"" written on it. I wanted to play this with my five year old son but it is too hard for him to read the cards."
5,a different Oldfield,"That's Oldfield at his best! Huge, fresh, even funky. It's interesting and amazing how this man can first record a whole album on his own and then lead a group of almost 60 people to perform brilliant concerts. Pitty I was too young then, must have been impressive."
2,TASTES LIKE 2x4 SCRAP,I purchased all of the smoker chip flavors. All of them except the hickory were worth it.
5,Triumph-Stages,"I really like this record. The sound quality is pretty good for mid 80's production. The studio albums are more crisp but this record is raw and you can feel the electricity. Having seen Triumph in 1986, I can say this is very close to being there. The song selection is good, the playing is tight and it seems like the boys are having a good time. Listen to the crowd interaction on ""Laying it on the line"", wow, that is what a live album is all about. This is a must have for a true 80's rock/metal fan."
3,it's a shame,I originally purchased stages on vinyl. I was very dismayed when the CD came out and did not include the entire vinyl repetoir. I pitty the soul who blew this one. This is one CD that did not make it as a replacement for my vinyl.
5,Just what I wanted,I had one like this for my oldest child and wanted a similar one for my youngest. It turned out to be exactly what I wanted and worked perfectly. I think these are great keepsake items.
3,Footprint clay super sticky!,"I bought this once before for my older son's footprint, found it easy to use, and loved it. However, when I bought it for my baby girl, I found the clay that came with it was super sticky! It was hard to get a foot imprint without the clay clinging to my child's foot. It was like the consistency of chewing gum this time. I had to end up dusting her foot with talcum powder to keep it from sticking, but only thought of this after re-kneading and re-rolling the clay a few times. I do still really like the mahogany hinged frame though."
2,"I hate to say it, but my dog didn't like it.","I feel bad giving this a bad review, but my dog really wasn't into it. I looked at the ingredients and it all sounded like stuff she'd love, but she didn't. I think this might just be personal preference."
5,The Happiest Baby on the Block (DVD),This DVD worked miracles for my daughter and her husband. The baby is now four months old and for some time has slept through the night. We will recommend it to anyone we know with a newborn and will pass our copy on.
1,Didn't work for us,"I read this book fully and was really on board with the concept of the fourth trimester. In fact, I still believe in it, but the methods just didn't work for us. Part of the problem may be that my baby didn't like swaddling. It didn't matter who did it, how well it was done. She didn't like being restrained by the blanket at all and she would fight until she got out of it. I got the impression from the book that all babies do like it, they just don't realize it. Well, I'll just have to agree to disagree on that. And shushing didn't always work either. But since swaddling was out of the question, and it was the biggest step, this could be why the rest failed for us.In the end, the only thing my baby really wants is to nurse 24/7, even while she sleeps. This is not unnatural, so I go with the flow."
5,Best tool for new parents,"This DVD saved my life. My husband and I were trying to manage the challenges of breast feeding, schedules, and everything else new parents have to get used to in addition to calming our 3 week old daughter. Our daughter is now 9 weeks old and life couldn't be any better. She sleeps at nights for 5-6 hour stretches. She's swaddled for most naps and is primarily placed on her side so she can release her trapped burps on her own. Dr. Karp's theory is so basic and elementary that it's overlooked. Once you start to replicate the womb you assist in the transition between fetus and baby. I strongly recommend this DVD to any new parent. I also purchased the book but understandably have not had a whole lot of time to read.Congratulations and good luck."
2,This Video Makes Good on Its Promise,"Every new parent should see this video before their baby is born. Dr. Karp presents a practical and positive approach to helping soothe a crying baby. His method is easy, and it works. I watched my daughter and son-in-law soothe their newborn after viewing Dr. Karp's video, and he quieted within moments. Done in a very instructional but upbeat manner."
4,New Parent,"Last night was our first night at home with our infant daughter, thanks to a caesarian, my wife was unable to carry her around and comfort her.This task fell to me, and all through our first night home together, I had 3 occasions to feed/change/put her back to sleep. Thanks to the tecniques in the dvd, it rarely took more than 15 minutes to get her back to sleep"
3,all these techniques are available on the web for free,"If you have the what to expect the first year book, babywise or any other book they have the same techniques available...as does the web."
3,Life saving info,"If you don't already know about the five ""S"" for baby soothing... then this could change your life. But if you are already familiar and utilizing them... this vid probably won't further your knowledge too far... it certainly won't hurt though.Here they are in case you want to just cut to the chase:SwaddlingSide/stomach positionSwingingShushingSuckingGood luck!"
5,Wonderful DVD,I heard a lot of positive things about this DVD/book from some parent message boards that I frequent and decided that I should check it out too. I was a teeny bit skeptical at first but after trying out the techniques on our newborn daughter I was amazed!!! She is almost 6 weeks old now but will sleep almost all the way through the night and can be calmed down almost immediately with the 5 S's. I recommend this to any and all parents of newborns/infants. I can't wait to graduate to the Toddler series =)
2,For newborns only!!,"I bought this dvd looking for a magic cure for my 10 1/2 month old who went from being an excellent sleeper to an over tired baby with sudden sleep issues. The picture of an older baby on the cover is misleading. The principles that Dr. Karp ""teaches"" in this dvd are all very simple and intended for new infants. Maybe I had an exceptionally good experience in my hospital after giving birth, but all of these things were taught to me by hospital staff, and in a much less redundant manner. I gave this product two stars only because it may be helpful for a newborn of first time parents, but as for myself, I am very sorry to have wasted the $20 bucks on this dvd."
2,"Geared for parents expecting first child, newborns","This tape wasn't helpful to us, our baby was four months when I ordered it. The techniques to soothe didn't work for her, at all. It is more geared toward newborns..."
1,Not very useful,"I used this for several days then switched to a DietMinder journal. The Atkins journal doesn't have enough room to record everything you eat, let alone any reactions you might have to what you eat (cravings, bloating, etc). In addition, it has one of those cheap plastic binders that comes apart after a while. I highly recommend the DietMinder instead."
5,Making Candy,"There are two items that make successful candy every time. One is a good/real sugar pan, which this is, and a good candy thermometer. You will fail if these two items are not acquired before you start your first batch. I never fail any longer, and this is the basic 101 reason why! To compete with the best, you must buy the best. Don't wait buy this pan today!"
1,Why bother?????????,I dont get it. Why listen to someone copy the original without any different interpretation. I can understand a live thing a la The White for nostalgic purposes but on CD to listen to at home??????
2,Not Very Good CIA Potboiler,"Like several of your other reviewers, I am a fan of Timothy Dalton but I have to wonder what he is thinking half the time with the roles he picks (Brenda Starr, The Rocketeer, etc.). At any rate, while this is a more meaty role, and he makes a very dashing operative, the story is fairly idiotic and the production is second-rate. In fact, the quality of the video is terrible and you have to strain to see what is going on, ridiculous as most of it seems. The picture of Marg Helgenberger dragging a baby over and through the Afghan mountains while spouting flower-child preachings is enough to send you screaming into the night, to say nothing of anything else. In sum, a sad waste of Dalton's talents (can this be the same actor who played the definitive Rochester in Jane Eyre?) as well as Omar Shariff's."
3,Worth a Try!,"It's so hard to tell if herbal products really work or not. The difference in your condition will not be remarkable with most herbal products but it's worth a try to help your immune system when coming down with a cold. I've heard on the news several times that Echinacea is not effect in preventing colds which is the primary ingredient in this herb defense product. I was relying more on the lesser ingredient Elderberry which I've heard really great things about.My son got a cold so I started taking the Gaia Herbs Quick Defense, it did seem to help. I did get sick but I would feel better after I would take a dose and I didn't get ""that"" sick. So the verdict: I would try Gaia Herbs Quick Defense. During cold season, I think it couldn't hurt to do all we can do for our immune system. It's really hard to prove one way or another whether this herb defense helped my immune system."
3,quick defense,"This is kind of supplement that you are supposed to take at first signs of cold or sickness. It has 20 capsules and you are supposed to take them all in within a couple of days. My husband did get better in a couple of days after taking it, but he was also drinking lots of liquids and eating foods rich in Vitamin C. I am indifferent to this. If you are desperate to get rid of symptoms and want to do everything not to get very sick - this could help. But I much prefer just lots of fresh ginger and rose hips. Be well!"
2,"Excessive pills, not worth it to me","This is not a product I would get again. One bottle is 20 pills and you need to take 2 pills five times a day. That is way too much pill taking for me. If I'm getting sick, the last thing I want to do is think about taking pills that many times a day. And it only covers you for one time of being sick. I did test it when I felt a cold coming on and it did nothing to defend against it.They do a good job of detailing what is in the product though, I give them that."
1,Didn't notice any difference.,"I took these as directed, and after I finished my dosage, I noticed no change. I was really sick for a week, and couldn't get rid of my cough for almost two. Which is usually a lot longer than it usually takes me. There's a lot of hype over products like these for nothing, IMO."
1,a strong smelling perfume,"A strong perfume , bad smells like coconut oil, would not buy this product again . Will not recommend to friends and family"
5,Great Book for Gardeners,Excellent book with great recipes & instructions on vegetables. Try the Mustard Lemon Potatoes it's a family favorite. Also a great gift idea for families w/ gardens
5,A gardeners review.,"I have had a copy of this cook book for years, and it shows its age. I use this cook book ALOT. I can only think of one recipe that I didn't like."
4,Not for the Lay Person,"Having read several books about Chaos Theory, and having been promised a user-friendly and yet academic book on the subject, this book fell a little short. Certainly academic, not so easy for someone who does not have a solid background in the sciences and mathematics fields. The various sections cover much of the recent research, and if you can get past the equations, you get a more complete sense of the progression in the subject."
5,Great Stuff from the Great One,Lorenz has done it again. This is a terrific inside look at chaos by the man who made Gleick's book possible. And it had a few interesting new ideas too--who would have thought there was a different way to present fourth-order Runge-Kutta? Who would have thought Runge-Kutta could convert a phase-space circle to a nice-looking fractal attractor? A good book for the air plane.
3,Come to the Meadow is better,"I have both the Cello Quartet and Come to the Meadow on LP from the original issue. There is no question that Come to the Meadow is by far the superior recording. It swings with much more jazz feeling. Your toe just won't stop tapping. I'm surprised that it wasn't chosen over the Cello Quartet for release. Some record executive didn't do his homework.I want to replace my Come to the Medow LP with a CD, so I will keep looking. Maybe, one of these days..."
3,Numbs your mouth completely--unsure why these are so popular...,"I had a vicious sore throat that had me searching amazon reviews for well-reviewed products to try. After trying Cepacol I don't know what the fuss in these reviews are about.Yes, the product fairly effectively numbed my sore throat. Unfortunately, it numbed everything else in my mouth along with it--which seems to be the common problem with all these products. I wish I could find something that soothed my sore throat but didn't numb my tongue and everything else along with it.For me I guess I'll stick with 800mg Advil whenever I get a bad sore throat over using these..."
2,"Dated, boring and pop metal...","A disgraceful effort by Triumph.... The album stars more or less effiiciently with ""Never Say Never"", and then comes ""Heade Foer Nowhere"". Then begins a ""pop metal opera"" without end, lifeless, utterly commercial it seem it is another band altogether. This would be the last album to buy if you're wanting to know this great Canadian band."
1,Poor quality,"I am giving this filter wrench 1 star just because it did not completely fall apart. I've borrowed my neighbor's older model, USA made Plews 70-715 filter wrench several times before purchasing one for myself. The difference in quality was night and day compared to the newer foreign made wrench. The cam mechanism which causes the jaws on the wrench to open and close would slip very easily when trying to remove a filter, even when only installed hand-tight. Save yourself some money and look into other options."
5,Good!!! Its good!!!,Alice In Wonderland is the only story to truly challenge my imagination. The current movies with all their special effects do not have the poten- tial to amuse me
3,better than other alices movies but not as true to book!,"Sticks to the regular ALICE book, up untill the LOOKING-GLASS scenes they start to run short on time, so cut out 1/2 of the LOOKING-GLASS ,this ALICE was more to the first 1/2 of the story but still little things were cut, changed, etc. where could have not made a difference but over all, better than rest but not as good and as true to the story as could be."
4,"Magical, entertaining, funny, and dazzling","Carroll's infamous tale has been made into movies nearly a dozen times, however this version does a good job of keeping true to the text. The story is entertaining and the Hollywood big-shot cast is quite funny. Although originally TV-ready this version may be frightening to young children...especially if they were expecting Disney. The strength of this production lies in the special effects...most notably on DVD. It is for movies like this that you bought a DVD player in the first place."
2,Scenes missing,Everything was fine until we got to scene 7. Scenes 7-14 were missing - completely! I assume this was probably an error in the manufacturing for this particular batch (the replacement dvd I got did the same) which is why no-one else has commented on this happening.
3,use it for polymer clay,"i got this to work with polymer clay for beading. it works pretty well, but is time consuming to clean.overall i am pleased with the product."
4,Good,"I was very pleased with the item. However, it is good to know that the machine can only handle small amounts of pasta at one time, so the process is a bit time consuming."
1,Horrible service,"I purchased a book and recieved photo copies of the entire book. I paid for a hardcover book, not photo copies! Would not recommend to anyone!"
5,Favorite show since Moonlighting,Really love the cast. Danno and Steve are the best crime fighting partners! The humor in this show is magic. So hoping this show will go on for many seasons to come. Anything Alex is in is worth watching:)
5,Hawaii 5-0 is a 5 Star show!,"Hawaii 5-0 is a show I look forward to viewing again and again. It has a great cast. I also enjoy how it is tied in to NCIS LA, which is another great show. After a hard day, I know I can get lost in an hour of entertainment with Hawaii 5-0. If you're looking for a great show to watch, this is it."
2,Not what you think,This is not the first season although the cover looks the same. This is just five episodes from one season. Spend a little more and get the entire season!
4,Just Keep The Music Moving!,"In the times when k.d. was still working the charts heavily, this song came along and did quite well! The original version is taken from the soundtrack for the film ""Even Cowgirls Get The Blues"" starring Uma Thurman.This CD single is wicked because it contains the 'Movin Mix' produced by Tony Garcia. He did such an awesome job on it. I used to hear it often on dance radio stations back in 1993, but they would edit it down for airplay. I just wish this disc also included the Movin Dub that was pressed on vinyl, but I'll take what I can get here because it's a really groovy house mix!Track List:----------1. Just Keep Me Moving (Remix/Album Version) 3:582. Just Keep Me Moving (Radio Remix) 4:103. Just Keep Me Moving (Movin' Mix) 6:414. In Perfect Dreams (Album Version) 3:095. Just Keep Me Moving (Wild Planet Mix) 6:16"
4,Remember This Cd,"In 1993, after the relapse with Madonna's Sex-Era, she needed a hit song. This song helped put her back on the top, where she belongs. I love the song ""I'll Remember"", it is a very simplisitc, gorgeous song.1. Album Version: The best version and my favorite.2. Guerilla Beach Mix: I don't like this mix. It is too long and it gives the song a differnt sound that just doesn't work.3. Why's It So Hard (Live From The Girlie Show): This version is by far better than the album. In the album version, Madonna is singing softly and simplistic. In the live performance, her voice is full of power and energy.4. Orbit Mix: This is my favorite remix of I'll Remember. It stays will the orginal song, while adding a little William Orbit sound to it."
4,Long lost album - found!,"God, am I happy to see this! Someone swiped the LP from my house years ago and I have been desperately looking for it ever since. Wonderful, wonderful music!"
2,Give me Mesquite Bean Pods!,"I have to admit I like woodchips and as woodchips go these aren't bad. I am just spoiled after using Mesquite Bean Pods. The flavor intensity, sweetness, and that OOOOOOOOOOOhhhhh so good taste I found with Mesquite Bean Pods leaves woodchips out in the cold. I would buy 5 lb. bags of woodchips at a time as I disliked running out. Compared to Mesquite Bean Pods you need at least twice as much woodchips to last as long as Mesquite Bean Pods and still you won't get as good a taste."
5,This book is the real meat and potatoes of closing sales.,"I first read this book when I checked it out of the library, and it was so good, I had to buy a copy for myself.. No kidding, I read a lot and every other book I have read doesn't hold a candle to this one. One of the best I have read in my life. This book doesn't tell you what to wear, or to shine your shoes (which if you call yourself a sales person you should already be doing). It gets right to what matters most, CLOSING SALES. Many different options are offered, and I'm sure you'll find several that will work for you. Email me if you have read anything comparable. Thanks you."
2,No. No. No.,"Charles Roth was one of the top sales authors and trainers in the world. His work is timeless and totally valid today.This is a POOR attempt to trade on his name and material by ""updating"" it. A very poor attempt. Get the original by Charles Roth only. Compared to that, this one stinks."
4,cute lamp,"This lamp is good quality, and is cute. But I got it for less with the lampshade, for about $32.00. It's over priced here at babies R us, look else where."
1,to much for just the base,"i got the lamp shade as a gift at my baby shower, so i just had to buy the base.. almost 40bucks!! i returned the lamp shade and i went to baby depot instead because i had seen it online, got the base AND the lamp shade for 34.99!!"
3,"Not at all bad, but it could have been so much more.","Well, first let me warn you that Bastard!! is not a film for the easily offended. There is nudity and much sexual joking in the film, as well as a lot of rather graphic violence. In fact, I think this was done consciously to make fun of some of the various anime cliches. If you don't mind that, it's a rip-roaring adventure that is a lot of fun to watch. The hero is so audiacious and shallow at times that you want to dislike him, but his antics are just too much fun to watch. The main flaw that I saw was that too much plot was crammed into too little time. So much more could have been said about the pasts of the characters and thier feelings for eachother, and the ending seems very rushed. Truthfully, there is plenty of room for a sequel, as the ending leaves many ""loose-ends"" unresolved. As I said in the title, it was not at all bad, but it could have been so much more."
4,Awesome anime,"This series is one of the greatest animes ever made, BUT they never released the final episodes. Other than having no real ending it's a great series. I would recomend this series to anyone that is into anime."
2,Avoid this at all costs!!!!,"The negatives HIGHLY out-weigh the positives in this complete pile of crap. The dialog is ABSOLUTELY horrendous, even by Anime stanards (most animes don't have exactly ""the best"" dialog, but this, ugh, sounds like a 6th grader wrote it). The artwork ranges from excellent to pitiful. The story has alot of potential, but it was gone to waste by a bunch of incompetent writers and animators. Again, avoid this at all costs. Get Wicked City or Spriggan instead."
3,Fun Toy,"The first delivery was defective. One of the keys was not working. The replacement was great, but parts of the piano have chipped. My 2 and 3 YO enjoy it."
1,enamel comes off,"Hi ... I had this lady bug charm added to my bracelet ... all of the enamel has chipped off like bad nail polish - thoroughly disappointing, don't waste your money!"
3,Good but not the best,"While good because very didactic, it lacks the scope of a book such as the Huber Yasargil on cerebral angiography.It has the advantage of beiong very well written and also by being more recent than other works on angiography that have dated quite a bit."
4,Early Steinbeck writing,"As a lover of Steinbeck's work, I may be prejudiced here, this novel about how a man can feel about himself and his place in the sun is a good way to get a feel about J. Steinbeck's evolvement as a writer of powerful & moving human emotions. As with any story, you must remember the place & time in history that it was written and the cultural parameters occuring during that time. I find this an exceptional early work for an author built on an uncommon, dare I say ""daring"", openess for religion, raw sexuality, family values and mystical beliefs at a time when American society was strait-jacketed into religous and social constrictions. It is stories like these that let readers stretch and push the boundries of acceptable behaviour and kept censorship at bay. Something that may be taken for granted today."
1,pleased I didn't buy it,"N'Sync are going to take over from BSB, I hope not. I hear them being raved about so I thought I would borrow this from a friend. All I can say is that I am pleased I did not buy it. Bye Bye has to be the best song on it and I thought this was a poor attempt at BSB.how did it do so well in the USA, I think the UK chart showing was much more like what it deserved. this is a poor band with even poorer songs lets hope thier next effort is better or that they mean it when they say bye bye"
1,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,This music and band (I use that word loosly..to be a band they have to write their own music and play instruments....nuff said) is manufactured garbage...nothing more....NEXT!!!
1,yuck,"I can't find one song on here that I would want listen to again. ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" is pretty good, but its boring. They sing they same type of songs over and over. Justin is pretty much the lead singer, and well i think his voice is just plain annoying. It screeches and cracks. Hasn't he already gone through puperty? How did he ever come to be the lead singer? ...First cd was better."
2,No creativity attached,"please people! you only like this cd is because you like them or should I say Justin Timberlake. The Cd contains only 3-4 good songs and that I promise you song is a carbon copy of one of Richard Marx's old songs. N sync is losing the flow with this one, they don't have the dance energy as they had in the first one and none of their songs could compare to ""I want it that way"". all their songs dance songs except for bye bye bye sounds like remixes of giddy up.Expect to see the boys sing ""bye bye bye"" to themselves in 2 years or so. The same probably goes for bsb after N sync dissapears."
1,"Worse than the first, which was horrible!","I know this will break a lot of hearts but these guys just cannot sing. There is not one song on this cd that isn't quickly forgotten almost immediately after a first listening. The ballad are boring and sound like millions of others done before, ""Just Got Paid"" actually hurt to listen to, and ""Space Cowboy"" was just too much. I really listened to this with an open mind, but musically this CD just doesn't work. I know it will sell millions and I know the guys are great showmen, but just please save the title ""great musicians"" for someone else more deserving."
5,No Strings Attached- One of the Best Musical Buys Out There,"*Nsync has done it again, with No Strings Attached, their newest CD. It contains their two most popular songs- Bye Bye Bye and It's Gonna Be Me, plus many others that they never play on the radio, but are great any way. If you're on of those people who refuses to listen to anything but screeching guitars, don't get this, but if you're a lover of actually good music, be sure to get this CD! ^_^"
4,Nice Try,"I thought this album was pretty good. It's extremely different from the others, though. It grows on you.And to whoever said that they were Justin up above in the reviews, nice try. You can't be. You didn't even spell *NSYNC right. It's not N'SYNC. And if you are Justin and don't know what your group's name is, I'd say you have a sad excuse for a brain."
1,"Please, couldn't this be 'No Screeching Attached'?","I used to like NSync way back when their Disney Concert came out. I stopped liking them around last March when I heard ""I Drive Myself Crazy."" I since then have grown to despise the group. I was hoping that with the release of this cd, they would improve. After hearing the intire cd played on my local radio station, I came to the realization that they will never improve. After hearing ""Space Cowboy"" I was on the floor with laughter. It is dissapointing that with such young fans they have, they would write a song like ""Digital Getdown."" So unless you are a hardcore fan who will not admit to the fact they don't have talent or appreciate screeching cats, don't buy the cd."
3,"Great Vocals, but too much ""Wigga"" in it","They're phat(and cute, too) and I admire their songs, especially ""BYE, BYe, Bye"" and It's Gonna' be me"", but come on- you have rappers on the album, too? Ain't that supposed to be for R&B singers?(no 'fensse, though!) Anywayz, i do heartily give them their congrats, though! Woop-dee-doo, go 'N Sync! oh, and Justin, i think you're hot- i luv ya!"
2,Just as I thought,"I thought the CD would be just terrible. I was wrong. They were better than I thought so I gave them two stars. I'll tell you why I gave them such a low rating. Well all the boybands have okay voices, but there lyrics are always about the same thing and it gets annoying after a while. Don't they have any thing better to sing about? I really don't understand the whole boy band craze. You know I really didn't like the CD. In my opinion I think that the boy band thing will go away in a few years, I hope."
3,they're ok...,"NO STRINGS ATTACHED is the craze all over my school. Although I don't enjoy this music much I had to give them some sort of credit for making it big. I do like their up-beat tunes and retro background music. And I also respect that they don't sing about matters inappropriate for adolescents, as the Backstreet Boys do (blech!). Thank you for reading my opinion."
3,"It'll do, I suppose","The CD has a few good songs on it, but in general their voices sound a little too nasal for my taste. I like the mix of music, though- it's different from what I expected it to be. If you like NSync, I'm sure you'll love it, but if you're a normal Joe like me, it's not really worth all the attention it's getting."
5,i luve nsync!,"this albumn rocks. i love it sooo much. they worked so hard for this and now it's finally here. nsync deserves respect and i think they will definetly get it. ""this is the battle we won"" sang j.c. justin, j.c., if u guys are reading this, i support you all the way. u two are the hottest guys in the world! God Bless!P.S. come to the Kohl Center soon. i loved your concert!"
2,A couple good songs,"There are a couple good songs- ""Bye Bye Bye"" and ""Its Gonna Be Me."" After getting the Cd and listening to the other songs on it for one or two weeks, it gets rather annoying. This CD will be good for a little while but like N SYNC, it will be nonexistent in the far future. YOU WILL GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO IT AFTER ABOUT A YEAR (AT THE MOST)! I GUARANTEE IT!"
4,Not Up To First,"This album is not bad, but it is not as good as their first American CD.It does not feel original. It's sounds like they just tried to rewrite some of their earlier hits and see what happens.I think this is a result of changing recording companies. They should never have left.I just wonder how much longer they will stay together."
3,it's ok-ay,"it's not a bad album, however, i would like to disagree with JC's remark about skipping tracks, there are somesongs that i find obnoxious, but that's okay, 'cuz i can NEVER EVER sing like that. well anyways, hi 2 everybody who's reading this. wassup? go buy 2gether's album, it's worth more =)."
3,"Geez, what' the problem?","Having read all (well, maybe some) of the reviews on this CD I had to listen to it. It seems that either you love the thing or want to trash it. So I pulled my 12 year old daughter's copy out and played it. Bottom line here is it's really not too bad. Yes the music is VERY digitally mastered, yes some of the lyrics I'm a little disappointed in, but overall it's has some good moments. Bye Bye Bye is catchy and hasn't gotten old from being played on the radio 10 million times a day. ""It Makes Me Ill"" also has a good beat (and a great name). And pretty much the music in general is upbeat and fun. I just think if you're an N' Sync fan you'll like the CD, if not why bother to trash them. If you don't like the current fad of ""Boy Bands"" then don't listen to them. I would recommend this for anyone who 1) Likes N' Sync, 2) Likes the current style of pop/dance music, and/or 3) is a pre-teen female."
3,This will be...,"my third review for the No Strings Attached CD. The problem is, I have listened to this CD over and over again and I don't know what to decide. The up-tempo songs on this album are good and danceable to. The ballads can make you put it into replay or make you put your finger inside your mouth and try to make yourself puke. I have no idea. Maybe because *N Sync can be half-cheesy and half-professional at times. But they don't deserve all the credit for whatever they've done (that we ""normal"" people get to know courtesy of the media and press.) on the surface. The producers (beside the boys), the engineers, the people who contributed did a fairly good album. I don't know. Maybe not. You decide."
3,ok,"this is a pretty good cd. i'm not a crazed fan of any boy band cd. this is my first cd i have bought by any real boy babnd. what made me buy this cd is b/cit is acutally pretty good. i love ""this i promise u"" it is so sweet. also a down part tat all the fast songs sond exactly the same. nsa bye bye bye thye all sound the same"
4,Getting Better,"I am not really a fan of NSYNC i am more of a Backstreet boys fan, but i have to congratulate them on a good album. Containing the hits Bye Bye Bye, This I Promise You and its gonna be me. (one of the best songs that i have heard in a long time) I am still not 100% convinced about NSYNC yet, but i am willing to give them a chance and never dismiss them without giving their music a listen to as i think that they have the potencial to go the distance."
1,Oh My God.,"That CD is just wrong, I will spare the reader the gruesome details which make this cd TERRIBLE."
2,NSA is not as good as NSYNC said it would be,I bought NSA because NSYNC said on MTV that this was going to be an awesome cd and every song was great and you would not skip any. When I listened to the songs the music and the words I skipped 6 songs. I felt like i wasted my money but my daughter wanted it and she only likes half of the cd too. I can hear her in her room skipping songs. I can't wait for the awards shows to come out and see if any of the cd or the cd itself gets nominated for anything. I seriously doubt it.
5,IT ROCKS,"The cd was a long wait, but it was worth it. It is a very good CD. It is not like the other CD's they have done. This is more for the older fans, but thats better. All the songs are in the future, and kewl. They are not like the others they have done, these are pretty much fast upbeat songs. These are songs that you can dance to, and fun to listen to."
1,Trying too hard,"Ever heard of the saying trying too hard? Well, that's what N'Sync is doing in their album, ""No Strings Attatched"" They obviously want to get the same feeling and emotion that ""That other boy band"" had in their sophmore album, but just end up with a mess of over hyped songs."
4,Almost,"This cd was not quite what anyone expected. 1,2,and3 are ok but the rest don't bother listening. I read Justin's review and he said that they were proud of their acomplishments on this album. I guess the public was just suprised at the styles of music they put on here. I'd sugjest just getting used to the cd then you can learn to apriciate thier hard work and dedication!"
1,Even MORE pop from the assembly line...,"Comon people listen to some music with soul and meaning. Buy Guns 'N Roses Use your Illusion albums. They rock and they'll blow you away musically. They have guys who play their own instruments in it, and play them very well. Please don't let music like this reign the charts anymore. It is a scam by the record companies for them to make s**tloads of money. They give you this sleek ""appealing"" commercial trash used to fool you and get YOUR MONEY!!! These guys are not musicians! Please listen to real music. Their are starving musicians everywhere around the world who deserve to get paid before these little droids do."
5,*N SYNC PROVES THEY CAN SING!!!!!,"This new album is great! I don't know what CD Rickey Wright was listening to, but it sure wasn't ""No Strings Attached."" N Sync proves once again that they CAN sing and write music. Branching out with their music styles and working with different artists keeps the songs freash and anything, but bland.This album has slammin' lyrics and hype back beats. Bottom line...they have more talent than BSB and will be remembered long after BSB is on VH1 ""Where Are They Now?"" Why? Because they have good music, are great people all around and remember the fans. BSB should takes notes if they want to keep in the game."
1,"Might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie, 'N Stink bye bye bye","This album is totally the worst albbum ever. I'm SOOOOOOOOOOO serious. This album is soooooo bad it's not even funny! I mean, guys, c'mon, is this some kind of joke? How can these guys be the #1 band the U.S.? I mean crackheads! Money is precious, don't waste it on junk like this. Bye Bye Bye 'N Stink!"
1,Sweet irony,"'No strings attached' is about the worst title a band like this could come up with. Oh wait, what am I saying? You know N'Sync didn't come up with this title.... or lyrics, or music, or dancesteps, or concept. A more fitting title would have been something more truthful like 'Puppets of the Industry' or 'Molded by the Coorporation'.White male pop groups have one and only one purpose. They are fodder for professional and amateur parody writers. Some of the best comedy I've downloaded from the net are parodies of bands like this."
1,eecchhh bubblegum pop at its worst,"gosh. i cant express how much this cd sucks. mindless, bubblegum pop just to make money. i cant believe all of you that like them, you have no idea what true musicianship is. it seems all you have to have is a cute smile and a mediocre singing voice to make it big. in This i promise you, justin cant sing a high note worth crap. wheres the other 3 people of the band anyway? gosh. there are such better artists. yet n sync are the ones that are selling the records and its really a shame. on the contrary to their cd title, there are strings attached. they are puppets and its a huge marketing scheme, and 2.4 million people that bought their album the week it came out have fallen into it"
1,nsync has no talent no matter what anyone says,"nsync has no talent no matter what anyone says. they cant sing, they cant play insruments, they only co-wrote a couple of songs on here. and trust me any nsync fan thinks that they are the best thing that ever happended to music. well there not. there the worst thing that ever happended to music. face all their fans just like them for justin and jc ."
3,Try Again,"Ok- when i first bought this cd, I loved the music on it. It has a good beat, and is fun to dance to. Bye Bye Bye, This I Promise You, That's When I'll Stop Loving You, and It's Gonna Be Me were pretty good songs, but the rest really weren't. The problem with this cd are the lyrics. Who cares if you just got paid? Wait- why don't we sing about cybersex? There's an idea. And since when are cowboys in space? Good music, bad lyrics. Try again next time N'sync."
3,I'm a Backstreet Boys fan!,"I was advised by a mate to buy this album and,as a huge bsb fan,i was surprised by it.I admit,i'm not stuck in the middle when it comes to he BSB/N'Sync debate.BSB everytime but,this album definately opened my eyes and made me realise that maybe you can have a bit of both.The devastatingly dark Bye Bye Bye is both classic pop and slight r'n'b which gives it an edge.Also,the great It's gonna be me shows the vocal talents of Justin(although a little bit of Nick crept in there!) and JC(although i'm sure i heard Brian/AJ fighting for breath too!).Even the soppy This i promise you is pretty,with a classic pop-ballad feel.Overall,i am still with BSB as this is too much like them in the earlier days but,this is really difficult to say,N'Sync are...alright."
2,Better than I thought,"I would give it a 2.63 if I could. Not bad, much better than Celerbetity. Chris vocals are the best"
1,what a let-down! 1,"This cd is so terrible! What are they trying to prove anyhow? I'm sorry that I bought it and listened to it. I thought it was gonna be soooo good, but frankly it's not."
1,COMPLETE AND UDDER CRAP,THIS STUFF [stinks] THEY ARE UNTALENTED LOSERS THAT DONT WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS OR LYRICS AND DONT PLAY INSTROMENTS. YOU CAN GET ANY 5 GUYS OFF THE STREET TO DO WHAT THEY DO. IF YOU WANT REAL MUSIC GET SOME NEVERMORE OR CREED CAUSE THEY REALLY [stinks]!
5,Total different style,This is an awesome CD! It is a totally different style for the guys. If you want something boy band but differnt from bsb then this CD is the one for you
2,Save your money!,"I find it hard to believe that this CD has such an awesome song as ""This I Promise You"" and the rest is, well, not good. Save your cash, and rip ""This I Promise You"" from a friend's CD!"
1,A complete disgrace to music,"let me just put it this way...i personally think that Nsync should go Bye Bye Bye. This I Promise You for sure. NSYNC [StinkS]!! but i have to admit, if they actually played their own instruments, wrote their own songs, didn't lip-sink in concerts, didn't do their little ... dances, didn't perm their hair, and didn't wear rouge lip-stick, i might just give them 2 stars. I just have no respect for this group, honesty. Theyre not even worthy of be called a band, cause if my senses are correct, in order to have a band you gotta play instruments, and not use computerized sycnopated rythms. the message im trying to get across here is that i HIGHLY DISLIKE nsync. Teen Idols???? yeah right..VIVA ROCK N' ROLL!"
1,arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,Oh my God! this is totally Worthless! this c.d. explains every bad word in the dictionary.
2,"Close, but shallow","I was at first pleasently surprised by this album, its fun...but it gets old very fast. I guess I was expecting music from a ""vocal harmony"" group (as they so desperatly insist) instead I got five dancers that sing."
2,Ugh ...,"This album is a compilation of nauseating lyrics and beats. Justin's voice gets annoying after the third song, and the lyrics are incredibly horrible. The only ""good"" songs on this album are the ballads, and a few of the slower tempo songs. ""Digital Getdown"" and ""It Makes Me Ill"" and ""Just Got Paid"" are really horrible, horrible songs.The best songs on this album have all been released as singles, so save your money and tape them off the radio."
3,THEY ARE A GROUP! NOT A BAND!,"this cd is ok, some songs are good, most are bad and immature. nsync have great voices, i have no problem admitting that but they need to put them to go use because i KNOW that they can do better then this! the first cd was better by far, come on nsync you guys have talent now prove it by making a better cd!"
3,I love their songs!!!!,"I love their albums and i love their songs especially "" This I promise you! and I drive my sellf crazy. When i heard their songs i feel in love with that songs. And i wish to them more power!!"
1,ewwwwwww...,"when i heard this cd sold 4 million copies, i thought it did FOR A REASON! i just got it today and it's a HUGE disappointment. The songs are very monotonous and they all sound the same. *NSync have tried to change their style from pure pop to rock/techno and have miserable failed at it. the only two songs that are good are not because of their vocals - but because of the instrumental sounds. And they dont even PLAY instruments... i don't really support this NSync- BSB rivalry, but i have to say, BSB is MUCH more polished."
3,"Hmmm, have to admit, they are trying variety","The boys had a style. It was pretty good, but then this CD came out and the 1st one has to be their ""good boy side"" and this one has to be their ""bad boy side"" I think the songs are good, but I think they are trying to be too much like all the others. Dirty and sexy. They are trying variety but I think we need more to it, NSYNC."
1,NSTINK,"Thats what they should be called. These boy band lovers say classic rock fans are caught up in the past well at least my favorite band is still together. And so is a lot of other classic rock bands. They think NSYNC is so cool because they have had two hit albums. Well I'll tell you somethin' about Styx. THEY WERE THE FIRST MUSICAL ARTISTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD TO HAVE BOTH 4 & 5 CONSECUTIVE MULTI-PLATINUM ALBUMS! AND THEY ARE ALSO THE ONLY MUSICAL ARTISTS TO HAVE TOP 10 HITS IN 4 DIFFERNET DECADES THE 70S, 80S, 90S, AND 2000S. So what you got to say now maybe you should do some resaerch then post a review."
4,over hyped,"Although I am a fan of *NSYNC, I was mildly disapointed in them. They had said numerous times, ""Oh, this CD is the best yet, you'll never have to skip tracks."" Well, i find myself skipping through the tracks, there are a few really awesome songs, totally different from what one would expect, but then the others are blah. plain and same old same old boy bandish. Over all this CD is a must have, just like the Backstreet Boys' ""Millenium"" is."
1,Don't like it,"N Sync is ... pink bubblegum teenybopper [music]....The music is bland, tasteless and hasno theme to it whatsoever. I don't call this music. Real music is ... stuff that has power. This CD does not have that. I put it on for 2 seconds and I couldn't stomach it."
1,The title says it all,"Declaring oneself a fan of NSync is like loudly procaliming an allegiance to a specific brand of diet soda: you blindly and fanatically consume a product that is neither original nor satisfying. NSync's music is flat, soulless, bereft of innovation or of even the slightest deviation from what their ""fans"" have been conditioned to expect. Everything about this so-called band oozes corporatism, marketing, and overproduction. The lyrics are formulaic, and each one sounds like it was written by a committee or, better yet, a computer. There are few surprises here and even fewer real emotions. The most ironic aspect of this album is, unintentionally, its title. Every note NSync sings and every move they make is controlled by marketing executives. They are as close to human puppets as you can get."
1,N'SYNC STINKS,"I HATE THIS CD, AND IF THERE WAS ANYTHING BELOW A 1 STAR, I WOULD RATE IT NEGATIVE 50,000. THIS CD STINKS!!!!"
1,N Suck,"Okay, when I first heard N Sync had a new cd out, I went out and got it, but now I'm sorry I did. It was a waste of money. This album SUCKS! Everybody is already so tired of the first single 'Bye Bye Bye',and somehow it got to be number one. I think these guys need to seriously think about their next album and do writing on it instead of the stupid songs on this one."
5,These guys are so awesome!,"I've heard most of these somgs on the radio and I think they are so awesome. This is definately the best album of the year! These guys are the best and I think it's great how they showed that they have ""no strings attached"" and did their own C.D. Everyone should definatly buy this cd. It's the best! LancetoN ChriS JoeY JustiN J.C., Keep up the GREAT work!"
1,The Continuation Of The Downfall Of American Music,"Remember back when we used to have real bands in the mainstream, bands whose fanbase extended beyond legions upon legions of screaming teenage girls with lots of money, bands who had talent, wrote their songs, played their instruments, and had some sort of meaning to the songs. This group once again proves my theory that people will buy anyting id it is promoted by someone who looks good. Why do you think NSync is so sucessful? IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MUSIC, IT'S ALL ABOUT THEIR LOOKS LOOKS LOOKS! WITHOUT THEIR LOOKS THEY WOULD BE NOTHING BECAUSE THIS MUSIC IS THE MOST TWO-DIMENSIONAL THING I HAVE EVER HEARD!Please please please..dont give any more money to these greedy, calculating record company puppets."
1,What is this?,"Everybody is saying how very good this is. I didn't enjoy thealbum. I happen to be a big nsync fan. This is very dissapointing tome. I was excited about the album when I read the goodreviews. Could it be possible the fans are writing good reviewsjust becauase they love nsync so much they don't care what the albumsounds like? Maybe it's because their standards for quality of musicis low. I'm picky about the music I like. When I heard Bye Bye Bye, Ithought it was a great song, though not timeless, like NSync saidit was. It's the only good song off the album. This I Promise Youcould be really good if it wasn't for Justin's nasal voice. The onlyother good song is Bringing Da Noise."
4,No Strings Attached,"While this CD is nearly opposite of thier self-titled debut, it shows you a side of Joey, Lance, JC, Chris, and Justin that would surprise even the most hard core of fans. ""No Strings Attached"" has a very obvious R&B influence, something many people I have talked to have raved over. The fast tracks have beats so good you'll find yourself dancing--even if you're the type who hates to. The album's four ballads are enough to bring tears to your eyes--which is exactly what track 10, ""That's When I'll Stop Loving You"", did to me. ""No Strings Attached"" is literally making Nsync fans out of people who never gave the band a second glance or listen. If you're an Nsync fan, or a fan of pop, dance, or R&B, this album is for you."
2,BACKSTREET'S BETTER,"I like N Sync and everything,but I'm sorry. This Cd is NOTHING compared to Millenium. The songs are gibberish and inappropriate for the kids it's geared towards. Digital Getdown is trash. {and you wonder why the youth of america is screwed up!) At least Backstreet Boys are mature and their material can appeal to adults. The only reason it sold so much is because all of the young little girls wanted to be the first in line to get it so they can hear Justin's oh so sexy voice. Give me a BREAK! Please,lock these guys up. And they're supposed to be Christains! Excuse me,I didn't know Christains grabbed themselves on national TV(referring to the video Bye Bye Bye) Please,get Millenium before this!"
1,Damn horrible,"Geez, I expected better. This cd is total [bad], with the exception of ONE song: No Strings Attached. This cd will remind me to never in my life buy another n sync cd. At least I can depend on the BSB to deliver quality cd's."
1,Terrible,"No real musical talent, typical bubble gum pop. Very disappointing. I'd heard so much about what talent these guys had compared to the Back Street Guys, who are only a shade better. My advice is stick to the classics."
1,bye bye bye die die die,all i can say bout this cd and group is they stink. i hate their music. disgrace to all talent. and what's up with them on the rap stations? huh?! i don't get it. someone let me know what's going on in peoples heads these days. speaking of people's heads....what's up with justin's hair.....girls he's UGLY! go for someone with more style and a better voice. he sounds like he's whining all the time. tell me...is that attractive or do you all do that too? yea....whatever....this cd is the worst...
1,Sorry but the Backstreet Boys are way better than this!,"I bought this CD...and the next day returned it for my money back! I'm a BSB fan, but hey I kept an open mind and tried these guys. They just don't have the vocal talent like BSB does. Their voices don't blend for one thing, and what's with Justin's whiny voice? Seems to me the record company just wanted to put out some 'swill' they knew would sell. Sorry guys, this just doesn't cut it. They don't have the class, the vocal talent, nor the songs to back themselves up. I recommend Backstreet Boys 'Black and Blue' and 'Hits Chapter One', they have much more vocal talent and the songs are better written and executed. Peace, Dakota"
5,They are grate singers and this cd is grate,I love this cd I just got it and I just got dome lisaning to it and bye bye bye is a grate song but the rest of there songs are diffrent and in this new cd they did some rock and a touch of rap. And I think that it cool for pop music that it ends up not being pop but it still it pop music. I higly recommend that you buy this cd.
1,What is goin on?,"The members of N'Sync have great voices and Bye Bye Bye is a great little dance number. But being a fan of all kinds of music, N'Sync is trying to hard with this new hip-hop sound. They have to face the fact that their songs from their debut are so much better. All of these beats in their news songs are too forced and choppy- they're not as fluid as songs like ""I Want You Back"" were. I'm not that big of an N'Sync fan as it is but this album is definitely something I would buy. You want to hear a great sophomore album with great lyrics and smooth flows, check out Millennium by BSB. At least they know what good songs are."
1,AAAAAAH! HELP ME! THIS CD SUX!,"ok,iwas never a fan of boy bands,ive always hated the backstreet boys etc.but when a supposed friend said the cd would change the way i thought about those things i decided to give it a try,result:possibly the worst album ive ever heard. They have two styles of song: fast and ""funky"", and slow and corny. That's what makes up the whole album. They are just a bunch of crappy singers trying to make money and attract 7 year old fans.i am a fan of rock[and a little rap does me fine]so i never thought i was going to like this,i was right.this album is a bunch of tracks which could otherwise be described as torture to the ear drums. honestly, if you want to help yourself through life listen to staind, disturbed, mudvayne, hedpe, slipknot, korn, deftones, nirvana, papa roach, RATM, limp bizkit, linkin park.........the list goes on and on. Take my advice and save yourself! RUN!"
2,One less *Nsync Fan.........,"I am totally switching over to Backstreet Boys, when I heard ""It's Gotta Be Me"" I couldn't take it any longer. But BSB on the other hand are more grown up and more deticated to what they do. So I would difenitly get Millennium for BSB than No Strings Attached from nsync. And plus I have seen them BOTH in concert and Nsync are pretty good etc, but they don't get it their all, BSB on the other hand put all they've got into it when they sing in concert. Nsync might have better dance moves, but BSB have better every thing else! You'r lucky I didn't rate this 1 star becaue the second star just stands for how much worse they are than BSB."
3,Not as good as last one.,"I admit there are some pretty good songs that I like very much, but the rest just are not good enough for me to give it 5 stars. Those songs are easily forgetable. Fast songs have the same tune and can't live up to ""Bye bye bye""."
1,They've Done It Again!,"These five talentless guys have managed to once again make me want to barf. My friends and I were hoping that with this album NSync would change and maybe actually sing well. But they are obviously incapable of that. The song ""This I Promise You"" has potential for a very beautiful song, if someone else sung it. I do not recommend this cd unless you're in need of a good coaster"
5,I SAID HOT DAMNNNNNNNN!!!!!,"Okey dokey here's the deal on No Strings Attached. This is one CD that is WORTH BUYING, trust me. It appeals to both guys and girls, and for the first time, I can honestly say that NSYNC sounds nothing like a boy band. Most of the songs are upbeat and totally radio ready...the ballads are veryyy sweet. The bass shook my car when I stuck it in my cd player...*L* I have the utmost respect for these five guys, and I think their talent and fame is well deserved. I'd like to see some of the people who claim NSYNC is a joke to go out and do what they have...AND still remain the nicest guys in the world. Way to go, NSYNC. :o)"
5,A Must Have,WOW! This is a must have for any N Sync fan. It has a more mature and R&B sound than the last album. The album is a great buy and you wont have to skip over any song.
1,It's Inspiring!....,"to garbagemen how could take it out to the dumpyard and smash all the copies for good. Just like their first album, it has this kind of music that makes u want to throw it out in the trash, and can't believe how stupid u were to buy it. (I am still hitting myself in the head for that)The songs are still repeating their chorus TEN too many times, and has this immature bounce to it. Just save your money and try not to believe in the album sales. Those are just stupid fans buying 20 albums trying to beat the Backstreet Boys record."
3,"Well, They Aren't NStink...",I bought the CD basically because I was curious what all the hype was about. I was pleasantly surprised through most of this album. I found myself groovin' along to the faster tracks like Bye Bye Bye and It's Gonna Be Me. It Make Me Ill and Digital Get Down are two songs that show that NSync isn't purely pop and that variety keeps the album moving. For the most part it's REALLY good. But I gave it the 3 star rating and not any higher since I felt that the ballads really fell flat. Their voices are good and they work well together but the harmonization could use a little work.
4,"A fantastic DVD, but what's up with MetalMike's solos?","This is truly a great DVD, great sound, great camera work, great performances by Rob and the band, great setlist (White Heat, Red Hot - YEAH!!!). One quibble: it appears that MetalMike overdubbed pretty much all his solos as what is heard consistently fails to match what he is seen playing. It's very distracting, and definitely takes away from the overall experience. Fortunately, Roy Z's playing seems to be flawless and up to his usual high standard, and there's no evidence of any post-production fixing by him. The whole band is firing on all cylinders and Rob sounds phenomenal, too. If I could have changed anything, it would have been to add a few more Resurrection songs, as well as Sun from Crucible - very disappointing that one didn't make it into the setlist. But all these are minor quibbles - if you love Rob Halford, you simply MUST have this DVD!!"
1,A complete rip-off,"I personally think the show is a complete rip-off. It's just a show that the writers, publishers, and executives thought from out of thin air. The show has boring plots off an alien topic with the name ""Animorphs"" tacked on. Wait a minute, the name Animorphs is the name of my favorite book series. Sorry, but I wanted to illustrate how the show has almost nothing to do with the books. Why doesn't Scholastic have a TV show where the characters are animated yet actually look real (not like the blade ship from the first TV show episode). It sounds crazy, but if it looks good enough (easy with the modern technology available) they could follow the book series without limitations that occur with filming real people as well as follow the script and events better. And finally, make each book a couple of shows long instead of cramming it into one show. That's all I have to say."
1,Beware ! Spoken Words Over Low Energy Drones,"Laswell and crew drone on the background while different voices tell us the story of Chakra.Except for track 3 and 4 where Sanders cuts loose there is little Laswell style cooking.This is a spoken word cd the music in the background is very low key, slow tempo drones that remain the same on all 7 tracks.Laswell fans have plenty of better choices unless you like people talking.Even if you could remove the talking the music is low energy that goes nowhere its similar to Rasa but lower energy."
5,Great alternative to non-stick,"I was looking for a pan to cook eggs (omlets) in, but didn't want to get non-stick, or teflon or whatever. This pan was recommended by the nytimes. It's not as perfect as an old seasoned cast iron skillet, but the le creuset pan is big, heavy and practically non stick, especially if you use a bit of oil. I cook everything in it -- chicken, hamburgers, fried eggs and omlets, sausage, pancakes -- and it's easy to clean, almost as non stick as my teflon pans (which I chucked). For what it is, it's pretty great."
3,decent,"this pan does not provide even heat distribution. there will be a significant hotspot in the center with each use, mark my words.it gets a lot of use, but i think a seasoned lodge pan of similar size does a better job for a fraction of the cost.there is a certain amount of gimmick factor with this pan. most of it's cost is for the pretty finish and the fru-fru brand."
5,Favorite skillet in the kitchen,"We cook eggs, steaks, just about anything on this skillet. Gets incredibly hot but even. Holds heat like you wouldn't believe, hot to the touch 30 minutes after you take it off the stove. Feels nice and substantial too. Just get it already, you'll use it all the time!"
5,AMAZING RON RAINES,"Broadway PassionRon Raines is an amazing talent. His voice stays with you as the music continues to play in your head long after the CD player has been turned off. His rendition of ""Dulcinea"" will move you to tears. It is the perfect match of music and voice. This CD is fabulous as is his SO IN LOVE WITH BROADWAY with an equally perfect ""Anthem."" All I can say is R3! (RON RAINES ROCKS!) And, on top of it all, he's one fine looking man! Check him out on GUIDING LIGHT as he plays the conniving curmudgeon Alan Spalding (the best one since Christopher Bernau originated the part)."
3,"A Good Record, Not A Great One","Despite the pressure from their record company, Jim and Co manage to put together record that has some great moments on it. I just wonder what these songs would have sounded like if Steve Lillywhite was producing, instead of Bob Clearmountain."
5,Works exactly as expected,"A necessity for removing a bicycle crank, this works exactly as expected. You can turn the tool with a wrench or socket, which is handy in case you don't have the right size wrench. Yet the second time I removed the same crank, I was able to do it simply by twisting the tool by hand. My crank is the square taper type, not splined. Though I haven't tried it on every type, I think it would work on any crank with the right size threaded cap."
2,What happened to the great characters?,"After loving ""At Home in Mitford"" I was sorely disappointed in this next installment. Instead of being charming and heartwarming, it was annoying and frustrating. Father Tim, so lovingly developed in the first book, becomes ineffective, brainless, and spineless. And the downfall is that the book concentrates so much on his reverted character, and so little on the wonderful townspeople and small miracles that happened in the prequel. Ms. Karon creates unbelievable, comic book characters (i.e. the widow after Father Tim) and then drags on and on about so few folks. How disappointing, I am not sure I will ever start the third book in the series."
5,This was a wonderful return visit to the town of Mitford!,"I couldn't wait to revisit Mitford and I certainly was not disappointed with my stay. This is a terrific book and definitely just as good as Ms. Karon's first ""Mitford"" book. I feel like I have a whole new set of friends now in the Mitford books. I am reading the third book now and will be quite sad when I run out of Mitford books to read. I sure hope that Ms. Karon is working hard on her fifth one"
5,An excellent integration of faith and life.,This was truly enjoyable as the second in the series. This book continues the friendship that we develop with the all-too-real characters. I truly appreciate the ability to show that Christians can demonstrate their faith through the way they live. The applicability of the Scriptures to life today is wonderful.
2,dissappointing storyline...,"while Ms Basso's writing style is good, the storyline-the heroine gets with her best friends husband 8 years after she's killed, and she was killed because she was mistaken for the heroine. Well, it was just kind of distasteful to me.Also, the idea of the heroine, a spinster, tracking down and seducing a rake to win a bet for her brothers-then lo and behold, her reputation is ruined by this-a bit far fetched and implausible too.Sadly, I'd say skip this book.2 stars."
3,Butterfly pendant,"I like the butterfly pendant, but I thought it would be much larger. I think it is false advertising when you show the product much larger than what it actually is. I was amazed when I opened the box and saw the pendant. The picture on amazom.com looked to be twice as big as what I actually received. I still like it but cannot wear it on my omega which is what I planed to do. The tri colors show off the butterfly nicely, but would not have bought it if I had known how small it actually was."
3,Shaw: A Consummate Craftsman,"I have a great deal of respect for Irwin Shaw. If you've read 'Rich Man, Poor Man,' you know that he is a consummate craftsman and storyteller. His literary world is largely limited to New York City, Hollywood, and metropolitan Europe. His stock in trade is melodrama. His characters are types. His forte is popular fiction with relatively little intellectual content. But he writes very bankable fiction of the New York magazine variety (clean, crisp, world-weary, mildly nihilistic), and he was surprisingly consistent over five decades. A number of his stories appear in college anthologies. If you are a young writer interested in writing for the slicks, you would do well to study Shaw's short stories. On the other hand, if you are interested in literary quality, buy his novels 'Rich Man, Poor Man' and 'The Young Lions.'"
3,They are poor quality,"But they got the job done, for soft dough, don't try it with other stuff..and also I used de 2 1/4"" cutter and when I was washing it the measure came off... now I will have to remember that one is 2 1/4..."
1,These are just too uncomfortable.,"I bought two of these as replacements for my 5 and 2 year old after a car accident. They are shaped exactly like the Safety 1st carseat that my son had prior. The only difference seems to be the cover. My daughter was only in this seat for 20 minutes and started crying because her back hurt. My son couldn't get comfortable either. The covers on these have a big wad of stuffing at the lower back, then a seam, and then very little (if any)stuffing up to the headrest, which is ridiculously overstuffed. This put her back into a very uncomfortable curved position. My son couldn't get comfortable either because of the stuffing at the lower back and the headrest. I'm taking these back today and then going to Walmart to get the Safety 1st that has a better designed cover."
4,MahJong Travel Set,"Got it as a gift for a friend. We' re traveling to Paris, etc., later this year and several of us play the game. I plan to get one for myself also. Only 'downside' if you can even call it that...is the weight. I hope it doesn't make our luggage over poundage-wise.Great service from Amazon."
5,Scanpan Fan,"I'm very happy with my new Scanpan. I purchased the fry pan and a wok and both work exactly as promised. Only one more test, and that is how they hold up over time. Clean up is fast and easy with just water, food doesn't stick when cooking."
4,Works for me.,"I've been using the pan almost daily for two months and have no complaints. It needs less oil than even my well seasoned cast iron pans, and nothing sticks. I've made burgers without oil in the pan, and the cleanup was a breeze. Unlike my old Calphalon nonstick, which I hated because most everything stuck, it allows food to carmelize and distributes heat evenly. The stainless bottom plate that sits on the burner does darken and you will need to use a cleanser to keep it shiny. Even if it wears out in a couple of years, I will probably replace it with another Scanpan."
3,Enjoyable Read,"I will read more in the series but I bought it because I liked the Harry Dresden files. This is VERY different and I personally do not like it as much.That said, well written and a good overall storyline."
2,extremely not fun,"If you watch low quality anime you see the same pattern repeated in this book. Good guys have some power and no luck, bad guys have a lot more power, have all the luck and are completely ruthless and arrogant. Good guys find someone who is destined/fated/prophesied/whatever. Deus ex Machina and the good guys win one small victory. And just like bad anime, there's more intrigue than resolution in order to keep the series going."
2,Has potential but not up to his usual caliber,"I am a huge fan of his Harry Dresden book- they have a lot of the elements that this book lacks, which made this such a disappointment. The biggest flaw is that he spends far too much time on action scenes and not nearly enough time on character development. There are too many people skipping in and out, and you never get to know any of them, which makes it hard to care when they are fighting for their lives for the umpteenth time. And against who- there are so many bad guys you can't keep them straight! He writes good action scenes and describes an interesting world, but when you don't care about any of the people who live in it it gets boring.I hope that in the second novel he takes more time to develop the people since it started with such potential. In the meantime, start on the Dresden file novels. Witty, full of action and suspense and GREAT characters!"
2,Less than what you would expect from an author this good.,"I don't know what happened. I wasn't expecting Harry Dresden when I picked up Furies of Calderon, but I was expecting something equally fun, witty, interesting, and--well, good.The narrative is flat. There is none of that wit that Butcher is capable of. The characters are uninteresting. The plot takes far too long to get set up.It feels like something that a 15-year old wrote. When I think about the talent the Butcher has of putting out a Dresden novel year after year--and they're all great--I look at Furies of Calderon and think he did himself a great injustice. The plot is fine, it's just that the narrative as a whole is completely lacking his usual skill."
2,Overly Verbose And Slow,"To begin, I will not compare this series to the Dresden Files. The two series are meant to be completely different and it is unfair to the author to create an association between them.I did not enjoy this book. The writing is overly verbose, distracting from the plot, and tedious. The action takes 200 pages to develop, and even then, barely anything has happened.Also, I can't get over the fact the the character Fade is a poor imitation of George R.R. Martin's character Hodor from A Song Of Ice And Fire. Butcher also uses the name Valerian, also from Martin's series.If you're looking for good fantasy, this isn't it."
2,Just okay,"I read this book about a month ago, and I have a difficult time recalling the story line. What I do remember, however, is that the author likes to use some of the same descriptive phrases frequently, which makes me grind my teeth at a certain point.I thought the world Butcher created has potential. The characters seem stiff and un-convincing, but that may change after he has some time with them over the next few books. I wouldn't buy another in this series, but I would check them out of the library."
3,"Good Series, but the First is not the Best","Hadn't read Butcher before (probably have to try the Dresden files) but picked up this series first.Overall the concept is good, but definitely a bit derivative and lacking polish in this first book. Probably more at the level of a lesser Feist book than really great fantasy. Probably worthy of a 3 and 1/2 star rating, but since the next two were better and are closer to 4's, I'm gonna have to round this one down."
2,"A bit simplistic, nothing new.","Jim Butcher has said that early on in his writing career he failed at writing ""sword and horse"" fantasy novels. This series proves that maybe he hasn't really overcome that failure. His system of magic, furies, is terribly inconsistent, and things are routinely done that goes against the rules that he has laid out. And as he has proven in his better series ""the dresden files"" he continues to have absolutely no idea how men and women interact with each other. This deficiency is painfully obvious, and makes men of his intimate dialogue scenes nearly unbearable. Not only that its tough to say whether its an homage or just his writing, but the writers that he claims are influences seem less like influences and more like source material."
3,Just Okay,"I find these books are not written as well as I would have hoped, based on my previous experience with this author. But the series is still readable. I got these in the ebook format and at $9.99 expected them to be edited and proofread at the same level as the bound books. This isn't the case! There are far too many easily found mistakes. Whoever proofed these books needs to move on."
3,Falls Short of the Harry Dresden Files,"Jim Butcher is an awsome novelist but this book falls short in so many ways from his first series. The story behind the book is good and engrossing however, because it is put together in a very choppy manner it is just annoying to read. The entire book is disjointed and hard to read. I know Jim has always wanted to write sword and sorcery books but this great story is told so badly that I almost want to stear people away from it. You will tear your hair out as you just start to get settle with one character when WHAM! you are switched to another character for sometimes up to 4 chapters, at which time you just got into that character to be torn away. I found myself skipping large chunks of the book just to get to the interesting parts. With all this critism aside I still had to go out and buy the second book to find out what happens."
1,Horribly Written,"I read up to Chapter 8, I finally get to do some work in Maya and what happens? The writer doesn't explain anything in depth on how to do the steps, he say's extrude the profile curb curve on the profile gap curve, I know how to use maya(I read 4.5 Fudamentals) I do it and it completely fails looks nothing like the diagram, after fiddling around with surface direction and varios options under exrude I finally get it to work, only to later see that it has nothing to do with the actual project(I looked at their files on the cd). I can't follow any of this without having to experiment for hours trying to get a singl step to work. Maya 4.5 Fundamentals was great, It tought you the tools and exactley what to do, I guess I'll need a better book to go more in depth Maya."
4,Friends,I love any book about the Civil War. This book is well written and I would recomend it and I am sure that I will read it again.
1,Poor Binding,The book is great - the binding is terrible. It falls apart on first reading. Do not buy this edition.
2,Most collectors should go with the red book.,"I bought this book looking for values to my coins when I realized it was dealer buying prices. Regular collectors should not own this book, and go for the Red Book. The Blue Book has little insight on the history of US coinage, and most clad coins (post-1964) are face value in MS65. But even the Red Book can be a bit misleading. The Coin Prices periodical, a bi-monthly, gives more insight on the prices of the best pieces. However, Red Books are the way to go for any collector."
3,Good advice...I think,"Dr. Weissbluth says a lot of things that make sense. He backs up what he says with A LOT of findings of different sleep studies. He seems open minded to different styles of parenting. He was spot on with a lot of things my baby was doing. The problem with the book is that there is very little organization to it. A lot of what he says seems to contradict itself. The constant comparison of ""common fussiness"" vs. ""extreme fussiness/colic"" is tiring and confusing to figure out which methods would work for your particular child. it spends about 90% of it's pages discussing different studies that have been done on sleep and MAYBE 10% telling you what you can do for your child. I just wish he had written a smaller, more organized book so I could actually understand what he was trying to explain."
2,Too much overlap with Healthy Sleep Happy Child,"I adore Weissbluth's first book 'Healthy Sleep, Happy Child' and I bought this one hoping for additional insight since our second child had health issues and fussiness. My son was four months old and I wanted extra tools, insight & advice (in addition to what I got from Helthy Sleep), but was dissapointed. This does not diminish my trust in his advice I just found that this book isn't needed if you have already read the first one.As a cying mom, trying to sleep train her son I was very frustrated with buying a second book with the same information. Weissbluth gives excellent advice (our son now sleeps!) but I would suggest buying this book OR Healthy Sleep, Happy Child but not both, there is too much overlap."
1,This is not an Authorized King James Version Bible,There are are word changes in the text of this book. Therefore it cannot be an Authorized King James Version Bible. It should not be billed as such.
3,Smells great but doesn't last!,"This deodorant is true to the label, but it does not last. You would be better off washing those pits extra well and then using perfume under them for a longer lasting cover!"
2,Stupid kind of funny.,"there are some funny scenes in the movie, but all in all it's a one-time kind of movie. If you've seen it in the movies, i don't think you would want to own it as a DVD"
3,Love Meet the Spartans!,"I know this movie got bad reviews, but it is destined to become a cult classic. I love oddball comedies and this fills the bill. I loved it and when I saw the movie 300, the spoof of it was great!"
1,Meet the Spartans,"The heroic Leonidas, armed with nothing by leather underwear and a cape, leads a ragtag group of 13--count `em, 13!--Spartans to defend their homeland against the invading Persians (whose ranks include Ghost Rider, Rocky Balboa, the Transformers, and a hunchbacked Paris Hilton--no one is safe when the Spartans take on the biggest icons in pop culture). This is the worst movie I've ever seen."
3,Really hyped up for nothing,Just another stupid movie. There was only one part i actually laughed the rest was just inanae stupidity. Not a great pick.
2,Mixing ancient with metrosexuality,"Mix of masculine males with modern metrosexuals had been used to a history-linked empty script of which degree of stupidity presented could just in general be overshadowed with different genre creations such as ""Hostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition)"".As these days ""Bruno [Theatrical Release]"" was banned in the Ukraine for ethic reasons, a very question remains of an item revied to be allowed in and demanded on in Greece.Overpriced in local shops as Amazon's $0.01 is OK."
3,sums it up here : Nicole Parker...,"Oh my,she does deserve the credit in this film;sure the film was not the best, and an outrightinsult even to ""comedy"" intelligence; but she (Nicole Parker)does what she doesat her best, and that is comedy!I speak of ""Nicloe Parker!"" ; she is the reasonI viewed this film, because her talents as a comedianand actress go far beyond the scopes of this camp film."
2,not so funny,The humor is kind of lame and sometimes doesn't make sense. It's way to random to be funny and I don't think i'' be watching it again.
1,not a reconciliation at all,"This book is not a reconciliation of Catholocism and feminism as the title suggests, but rather an attempt to conform the Roman Catholic Church to feminist ideals. Editors and contributors seem to have little knowledge of the theological reasoning behind Church teaching or the function of Chruch hierarchy. Arguments on abortion, birth control, and women's ordination are one-sided, and do not reflect the beauty of the Church's view of sexuality, such as John Paul II's Theology of the Body. This book does not reconcile Catholocism and feminism, but only divides them further."
3,We didn't received the correct products.,"We ordered all ""pink"" wristbands but we received 1/2 of them in white and 1/2 of them in pink. Due to the timeframe, we were not able to exchange or return them. We had to use them anyway even though they were the wrong colors."
5,"Hot, kickin' and a spectacular guitar",This is a hot album. I got into Swing by buying this album and it is still the best. All the songs are memorable and the horn-section is fantastic. But standing above all is Brian's guitar. If anyone likes guitars buy this album. Won't regret it. Listening tip: Rock this town. Hottest and most driving song ever!
5,Brian Setzer does it again!,"I have but one word for the latest of Brian Setzers' triumphs... HOT! He swings, he sways, he rocks and croons. There is not one track on this disc that I don't dig! Brian Setzer would have to be one of the forerunners in bringing back Swing to it's rightful place. Go Brian Go!"
3,Not swingin' but yet a necesity for every cat or kitten,"I'm with a lot of people in the fact that ""Jump,Jive An' Wail"" has been horribly overplayed to the point of drinking battery acid. But you have got to give this guy some credit for making swing what it is. Also the remakes of ""You're The Boss"" and ""As Long As I'm Singing"" are great songs and he has done them very well. But it also makes you wonder if all he can do is remake the hits of the past. ""This Old House"", ""Sleepwalk"", ""Since I Don't Have You"" and ""Nosey Joe"". Need I say more."
4,DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS!,"If you are pondering buying this album, and you have read Amazon.com's review of this album, think twice before moving on...I am a big Cherry Poppin' Daddies fan, and I think this album is excellent! Upbeat instrumentals, with just the right amount of volume from the horn section... catchy lyrics... But make sure you have your dancing shoes on before listening! The album is not as diverse as I would have hoped (hence the four-star rating), but I still recommended this album. Lots of fun."
4,Used CD - great and inexpensive!,"While the CD definitely gets ones blood flowing - makes you want to dance and sing along - it is a great CD, purchasing it used was a new experience for me with Amazon! But it was great - arrived within a few days and in great shape! Highly recommend trying it!"
3,hmmmm,"Well i have to say i love this c.d it's one of the best from modern ""swing"" bands. I use the word losely as i think alot of other bands don't keep up to skrach when it comes to the crunch.But being a stray cats fan as well makes me love this one just a bit more."
3,Brian Setzer Didn't Boogie,"Actually I was expecting a little more from this CD. I've got most other CDs from Brian Setzer and this one didn't sound like other recordings, at least to me. Still, it's Brian Setzer."
5,The MOST FUN you can buy for under $20!!!,"This is the best album I've heard in years. Of the 3 BSO disks this one is on top (with the first one a close second). Since I got this disk I've been getting to work in a GREAT MOOD! My favorite is THIS OLD HOUSE, but the whole album is terrific...I envy Brian Setzer - he's doing what he loves, making money at it, and it sounds like he's having a BLAST!"
5,Best CD I've bought in many years!,"If you like Guitar Slinger, you will enjoy this CD even more! The variations of notes he uses really blows me away! They are very creative. Being a musician myself, I look for things like that. A great song is ""You're the Boss"", in which he has Gwen Sephani, from No Doubt, do a duet with him. Her voice adds so much to this song. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes the combination of rock-a-billy and swing!"
3,"Good Graphic, thin story, get tired of it soon","The graphic is good, some of the girls are designed to be very sexy dressing. But for the game itself, not too much you can do except as an eye candy."
5,DOA4 Reveiw,"Great fun game to play, good online interface, great stages, awesome players, pretty much a great game."
3,GARBAGE GAME!!!!,"I absolutely hate this game with such a passion. If you want to get aggravated and end up yelling at your TV you should buy this game. Its to the point where this game is not fun at all. Some of the characters are just SO SWEET that they can not be stopped no matter how close you get. They will toy with you and make you think your going to win until the end where they beat you like you stole something. The last opponent is the worst, The only way of beating her is if she lets you. I enjoy a good challenge when it comes to games and I love the setting of difficulty that ninja Gaiden but there's a difference between challenging and just cheating and this games does a great job to cheat you right into insanity. The only reason why this game gets a 3 is because it has RYU Hayabusa from ninja Gaiden and if you play with a friend its not as annoying. I wish I could find one of the people behind this mess of a game so I can slap them."
3,Yet another double dip.,"As I thought, just after three months of the first release of ""The Grudge"", now we get the release of a ""Director's Cut"". So, the people who really like this film now have to spend additional funds to get a ""complete cut"" of the movie.Of course, now the movie studios are finding even trickier ways to get your money. They advertise and ""additional 10 minutes"", but don't tell you that these are not new scenes. Instead they tack on 10 to 30 seconds to every scene. While this might sum up to an additional 10-15 minutes, the differences are hardly noticeable while watching the film (for example, the ""Hellboy"" director's cut was almost exactly the same film).If you already bought this film and really like it, it might be worth renting this director's cut to see if you think it's really worth it. One thing for sure, I no longer buy any movie that I like until it's been on DVD at least 4-6 months."
2,Were they trying to make a film this bad?,"The film has the same premise as the first: a curse comes upon anyone who enters this certain house where a terrible murder happened. But now in part 2 the curse travels outside the house. So now you can become cursed by coming into contact with a person who was a friend of a person who's cousin's boyfriend's mother was in the house. Not really...but it does seem that just about everyone gets cursed in this one and it's rediculous.The Grudge 2 falls far below its predecessors. The plot is inconsistent. The acting is so bad that it's disgusting and is apparent from the very first scene of the film. The cinematography is bad. The scary scenes are predictable. And there are plenty of horror movie cliches, too! I kept watching this film - which seemed way too long - hoping it would get better and it just doesn't. This movie was a total disaster and I really feel like I wasted my time and money renting it."
2,a poor rehash of the first film,"Sometimes it's best to stop when you are ahead. I loved the first film. It was very scary, in my opinion, one of the scariest films I've seen - even more so than the first Nightmare on Elm Street and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But this film uses some of the same gimmicks to get scares as the first film. So naturally, seeing them the second time isn't scary. The movie is also a bit incoherent. It jumps around a bit in time and plot to the point that it's hard to follow. It leaves you thinking, ""what's going on?"" I love Japanese horror and some of the American remakes, but this one is one to skip. Go watch The Ring, both American and Japanese versions, the first Grudge film, the American version, or any of the numerous other films of this sort out there - The Locker 1 and 2, Pulse, Pray, and Dark Water (all the Japanese versions) are more good ones to see."
3,SO SO MOVIE...,I JUST HAD TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT REMINDED ME OF ALL THEM OLD JAPANESE MOVIES I GREW UP ON WHILE LIVING IN OKINAWA. COULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MOVIE BUT WHAT THE HECK...I MADE THE BEST HOT BUTTERED POPCORN (FOR ONCE) AND FOR THAT I GAVE IT AN EXTRA STAR!
2,Cliche horror with bad plot line.,This movie was ridiculously hard to follow for many people I watched it with and sort of lost its plot line. Typical horror cliches were amplified such as the room at the end of the hall has the scary things behind it. Characters enter the dark room. At least the first one had the sweet security camera scene. Not at all up to par with the first one.
2,"Simply put, it stinks","It's predictable, no great story, and just plain boring- I fell asleep every time I tried to watch it, and then this morning I got it out and made myself stay awake to watch it- I should of slept- my dreams have better plots to them... To me, it just didn't keep my interest... I like movies that have scenes you don't expect- original and not similar to other movies.. I give it 2 stars just because I got some much needed sleep...Buy this movie if your having trouble catching some zzzzzzsss..."
1,Ha Ha ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,This film is so stupid.Short summary of this film: Dead kid attacks girl. Dead kid has white makeup on and dead kid makes cat noises when opens mouth. Dead kid follows girl around.Seriously.???
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER...SAVE 2 HOURS OF YOU LIFE!!!,"The dumbist movie I have ever seen...This movie is really a comedy. The mother ghost sounds like she drank a 2 liter of coke because all she does is burp through the whole movie!!! And the son is a catlike freak who walks around meowing at people. The special effects are a rip-off of the ring and darkness falls. And you better watch out because if you are bad... You will disappear through your own BED!!! I have watched horror movies my whole life and I have to say this is the worst ever. Please save your time and money, I can only wonder how bad boogieman must be."
1,What do you get when you mix 2 completely unrelated storylines with choppy editing and a confusing timeline? the grudge 2.,"So awful! None of this made sense until the end, but barely, and even then the turnout wasn't good. Don't waste your time."
1,STUPID WITH NO PLOT,ANOTHER STUPID MOVIE WITH NO PLOT OR STORY LINE AND ABOUT AS SCARRY AS A BUGS BUNNY CARTOON ...SAVE YOUR MONEY FOLKS. AND GRUDGE 2 AND 3 ARE EVEN WORSE ... I PURCHASED ALL 3 AND GAVE THEM AWAY AND I STILL FEEL GUILTY FOR STICKING SOMEONE ELSE WITH THEM ...HORRER FLICK NO ... HORRABLE FLICK YES!!!
2,What Offal Is This?,"This movie stank. Had a good scene or two but made zero sense if you examined its plot. And then there was the chick killed while she was hiding under the blanket. Come on, everybody knows covering your head under a blanket makes you invulnerable to monster attack! What rank amateurism..."
2,A lot to be desired...,"I couldn't really follow what was going on at first. I finally figured out where I was supposed to follow the story about 3/4 of the way through the film. A lot of scenes dragged on, and there were times I had to stop the DVD and say I'd come back later to finish. Usually, when you have big name actors in a horror movie (Sarah Michelle Gellar is no Tom Hanks, but she is pretty well known), there's usually more of a fixation on the actor and less with the story of the movie. Some other good examples of this would be Scream (Nev Campbell, David Arquette, Drew Barrymore), I Know What You Did Last Summer (another with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Jennifer Love Hewitt), and House on Haunted Hill (Tey Diggs, Chris Kattan). I do give two stars for the great cinematography. That's about it!"
2,Buffy Does Tokyo!!!!,"It took me like, 3 days to finally watch the whole movie. I kept falling asleep or would just shut it down due to boredome. The story was contrived and dull, it seemed like they just wanted to make a ""Ring""-type movie, hoping they could bank off it. The special effects were totally subpar and this film was NOT scary!!!!!!!! It was actually funny. I burst out laughing when the creepy crawly ghost thingies made ""scary"" noises. I can picture the filmakers getting all excited and caught up ""Yeah! this will get 'em, that's sure to freak 'em out!"" NOT. Instead of being disturbing, the frog like groans reminded me of a 10 year old trying to annoy his parents. Totally lame! Nothing could save this movie."
1,The Grudge,"This movie is absolutely terrible! I watched it 2 nights ago with my parents and I hated it! It was annoying, cheesy, and downright embarrassing to watch. The zombie-looking woman & boy are so fake looking that it's not even funny. If you saw the movie Darkness Falls and hated it, then you'll sure as hell hate this. If you watch this movie and like it, you need professional help!"
1,Are You People Serious,"This movie is a piece of crap. Flat Out. They gave this film all the hype and put out this pos. I was actually happy to see this...at first. I figured ""Finnaly a scary movie that looks like it will be good"" Wrong. Ms. Geller must of been paid a VERY large amount of money to be put in this crap fest. Honestly follow these instructions youll be laughing so hard. Within the first scene of the movie...Pause your dvd player as soon as the Ghost pops up. Now look. HAHAHHA Its halarious to me. Its just some asian chick with eye liner. AHHH THE HORROR. Not to mention that they give a little kid eyeliner too. He makes cat noises I might add. Its so scary...haha. Rent this if you insist on seeing it."
1,Best movie ever!,This movie was great!I loved it!I bought it for $400 at a yard sale!The disc was scratch to pieces but it still kinda worked.The screen would freeze every 5 seconds and it had no sound!But it was good!
5,I LOVE THIS FILM !!!!,"I am not the kind of people who likes to watch horror films, because I find them boring, stupid or funny.But, this film is great. I like the story, the ghosts. Somebody found this film similiar to ""The Ring"", well a little. But, it's really worth it. The best horror film I ever seen, it's more realistic than Freddy Krueger, Frifay 13th, etc."
1,Disappointed,"Unlike other reviewers, I expect to be entertained when I see a movie. Whether I rent the movie or see it in the theater, I am paying my money to see the movie. I don't intend on wasting my money on a movie that I approach with low expectations.I rented The Grudge thinking that it was a good caliber horror movie. It stunk. The movie is poorly made and is not scary.Compared to another similar movie, The Ring, this movie is not even in the same ballpark. Don't waste your money or time with this let down of a movie."
2,slow,"Yet another overrated movie. I fell asleep watching it, even after trying to watch it twice.Annoying actors, annoying noises (loud noises that are supposed to scare your average teens), and it had a stupid ending. Chinese-buffet-horror"
4,Unrated Differences!,"This is a good thriller, I wasn't scared out of my mind, but never bored and had an eerie feeling throughout!Here is a link to a description with pictures showing the differences between the theatrical and unrated versions of the film:[...]"
1,The Grudge 2,"Aubrey *Tamblyn) travels to Japan to bring her sister Karen (Gellar) home after the events of the previous film. While there, she gets drawn into the mystery of the house and, along with a reporter (Chen), goes on a quest to find out the truth behind the ghost Kayoko's anger. Also in Japan, three girls enter the house on a dare, and bring a bit of the grudge out with them. Finally, in America, a distraught girl returns home to an apartment complex, and strange things begin to happen.All of these stories are related, and come together somewhat unsatisfyingly in this unnecessary sequel to 2004's ""The Grudge"". The story is weak, and the acting is nothing impressive. The ending almost certainly guarantees another sequel, this time more close to home. Anything creepy from the previews in tame when seen in context, and that means that ""The Grudge 2"" fails as a horror film. Stay away from this stinker."
1,"I Wish There Had Been A ""No Star"" Rating","Even if you can see it for free, this movie is a massive waste of time. Wooden acting, confusing ""new"" details that don't mesh with the original story, too many attempts for a quick scare."
1,NEED NOT BE A SCARY MOVIE,"THIS MOVIE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING SCARY, IT KINDA JUST WAS A MOVIE...... THERE WHERE A FEW SLIGHTLY JUMPING SCEENS AND A FEW THAT MADE YOU GO HUH, BUT NOTHING THAT MADE ME HAVE ANTHING CLOSE TO NIGHTMARES OR SLEEP WITH THE LIGHTS ON. IT REALLY COULD HAVE BEEN AN ACTION/MYSTERY MOVIE WITH A PREDICTABLE ENDING THAT DOES NOT LEAVE YOU WANTING MORE. WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT ON CABLE/DISH."
1,would...,I would give this 0 stars if I could but amazon doesn't have it available. This is the WORST movie EVER. Stupid and retarted. This movie is NOT even worth a rent. Don't waste your time.
4,Very Creepy,"This is one of those movies that are great to watch in the dark - BUT NOT ALONE! It will really creep you out, and if you are a fan of scary movies that's why you watch, right?!"
3,Incomplete,"I must say I was a little bit disappointed when I saw this movie. The main story of it was very interesting, but the movie felt incomplete. It was only about 90 minutes long, which to me is too short for a horror film. It seems like the main outline for the movie was written, but that was it. They didn't elaborate the story, so it was too basic. There is no real character development in the movie, so when it ends, you really don't care that anyone died, because we never really got to know them. I give this movie 3 stars for an interesting idea, but I just think it could have been much better."
5,A Great Horror Movie!,"The Grudge was one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. It was full of jump scenes from beginning to end! The amount of scariness on it was pitch perfect. I have watched it two times. This movie had a great explanation and you will not be able to stop thinking about for the rest of the day.The Grudge is rated PG-13 For Scary Scenes of Violence, Creepy Images, And Brief Language"
3,It's okay.,"An American nurse living in Tokyo Japan goes into a house that is haunted because a man killed his wife in it when he found out she was in love with another dude. Now, she is being stalked by this evil spirit (they never really tell you who's spirit it is) as is everyone that enters the house.The story is mediocre, but there are some really creepy scenes. Worth seeing."
3,Not so scary but watchable,"I have seen this twice. There are many creepy/haunting things. This is one movie that you will remember awhile. The sounds. (ohhh)the shapes + eyes. My brother was watching this with his girl friend. He is a big baby. I went around the back of our house and banged on the sliding glass door and he screamed. (It was the part in the hallway where hes watching the tv screen) My mom came running down and my brother (16 yr old) was crying. Right there in front of his girlfriend. He still doesnt know it was me to the day. I guess I am not as easily scared, but to some this will be nightmarish. Have some friends over and see this. This was much better than the Ring 2. They are very different but both adaptions of Japanese horror films. Them creepy lil people with freaky eyes who come out the back of yur head are gonna getcha!!"
3,Not like they used to be,Bag is ok but rim around the bag is plastic. Used the metal ring and line hook from our old bag as it was still good. would consider looking at another before ordering again.
2,not a 2007 publication,"This book is listed with a 2007 publication date, but it is actually a reprint of a 1959 book."
2,I Believe My Heart,"Just one song, the album title was worthy, the rest of it are just anothersingers songs which they have a much better performance. I wouldn't recommend the album."
4,This is not for xp users,I have windows ME and it works fine. No problem taking pictures and downloading them to the pc. Pictures are sharp and clear for such a low cost digital. All in all I'm very happy with it.chiaz
2,poor assembly,"Had to return the rack. A cross piece was improperly placed preventing the unit from opening completely--The product had potential: good wood, good idea. I could have repositioned the cross piece-- I see it now in the photo of this review-- it's just to the right of the blue mug handle, but why bother when my wife coincidently brought a similar item back from Sweden with nicer brass brads.. (My purchase was meant to surprise her..) So we were both surprised.Bravo to Amazon which continues to be such a convenience: returning the rack was for free (which I was unaware of until I started the process). Of the myriad items from Amazon--- it's the 1st returned."
5,"Parenting Advice, Curated by a Real-Life Nanny","What I love most about this parenting advice DVD is its legitimacy -- it's written & arranged by someone who spends most of her working life with children, and who has done so for years. The DVD presents parenting advice in several areas, always with an eye towards fostering positive child development, not just in the short term, but the long term. The interviews with several child development experts, which are featured throughout the DVD, are among the most interesting segments."
1,Ridiculous,This was a silly documentary that was supposed to represent child development in an educational format. Instead it was more like watching a play group with a narrator who shared their own personal viewpoints on child rearing with an undertone of Christianity.
1,Polder probe is weak link,"I have not 1 but 2 Polder thermometers with bad probes. (I know that they're bad because I tested them in a pot of boiling water). One reads ""192 degrees"" and the other reads ""232 degrees"". No way to fix or recalibrate so both thermometers are worthless. BAHHHHH!Polder Original Cooking Timer and Thermometer"
2,LED Display doesn't work!,"The unit worked well until the display starting to malfunction. The LED display doesn't display properly. There are lines missing, so you can't see the whole word or temperature numbers. I am now in the process of looking for a better unit with a display that actually works."
3,Almost Perfect But Not Quite,"Overall performance is great: accurate temperature readings, strong magnet, long cord, unobtrusive design, and every feature....but why oh why is there not a regular old-fahsion timer?"
4,"Great themometer, terrible probe!!!","This is a very useful tool for cooking meats of all kinds. However, caveat emptor: the removable probe can be problematic. I got a brand-new one of these products and within the 2nd use, the probe had failed. I was not able to easily get a replacement from Polder as it had been a gift, so ended up purchasing a new probe and then it worked fine. If they could perfect that part of the system, this would be a perfect cooking tool!"
4,What I needed,"We just had a child and needed to do some simple estate planning and my goal was to be able to go to a lawyer and have a real dialog.The book did a good job of preparing me for that situation and it did so very quickly. It helped me know which questions to ask even if some of the information in the book the lawyer did not agree with.So for me, for my purpose it was great."
4,Saving My Son,"This book has done more to save my son, who has been a drug addict for the last 10 years, than all three of the rehab clinics and AA meetings combined. For the first time in years, he is actually thinking positive and feeling good about himself. He also encouraged me to read it too. It is a great book for anyone, whether you are an addict or not."
2,save your $ for his next book(R.R.),"skip this one folks, Trimpey's just gathering his thoughts here. quite alot of what's in this book he omits in the later, ""Rational Recovery""(the book). the whole jist of R.R. is A.V.R.T. (addictive voice recognition technique). the Small Book has yet to fully develop this concept as his later work does, and it contains too much ""rational-emotive"" blah, blah... that I don't believe is needed, i.e. A.V.R.T. supercedes it. his book ""rat. rec."" is in my opinion definately worth the $."
2,Still too big,"Trimpey spends too many pages talking about how bad AA is. His AVRT method replaces AA's Higher Power with ""the Beast"", a demonized personification of ""the addictive voice"", which is hardly a new idea, and should be familiar to anyone who has been to church or AA meetings. He does provide some good advise on how to stop drinking and some sound cognitive principles for disputing the irrational thinking that leads to drinking, although it seems that he has since rejected the ""rational"" parts of his own book, which does not leave much. What is good in this book gets lost in the virulence of his attacks on AA. Many of his arguments against AA have merit, but he could have left out several chapters and let people make their own judgements about AA. Those needing help don't need to ""take sides"", they just need help. Read this book if you want to read a one-sided attack on AA, but if you want to get and stay sober, read Ellis and Velten's When AA Doesn't Work for You."
2,an angry man......,"it is too bad Jack Trimpey is so angry....and his book so simplistic....RR has some interesting ideas....and so does AA....the important thing is for the person to stay ""clean and sober""...there are probably as many ways to do that as there are people....WHY IS JACK TRIMPEY so arrognant and angry...work together for ALL."
5,The New King of R&B!,"I first heard Raheem on ""My Peoples"" from The Magnificent cd by DJ Jazzy Jeff several years ago. I was blown away when I heard his voice. Absolutely phenomenal! His sexy,sultry sound will be pleasing us for years to come!"
4,Amazing!!!!!!!!!,"I highly love this book .Right now this classic is FREE.......... But,this book may be to much for under age 10. I am twelve and I read this book at ten and was a little confused. But is a must read.This also is a great family book.Kelsey B.P.S. i like mainly because it is CHRISTIAN based."
1,you'll think it's great UNTIL the non-stick coating fails,"When these pans are new, they're wonderful to cook with, but within a few years, they're expensive junk. The coating fails. My enameled cast iron has proven much more resiliant (and, short of cooking eggs, can rival non-stick) and for true non-stick, my Caphalon non-stick skillet is still going strong - and I got it at the same time as I got my scan pan."
4,quality,"the pan is great, none stick is durable, would buy again. I do have a problem with the height of the edge, you cannot place a lot of food in being the edge is low and food falls over the side! Other than that, very well built!"
5,Very nice,"First time buying shoes on line. A little leery about fit and etc. Everything was as described, great quality, shipped fast, and I would buy again."
4,An interesting read.,I read this book some years ago but it struck me by with its focused anger and its accurate commentary on contemporary life in the decadent west. Certainly an interesting read for some one with an open mind and interest in independent thought.
3,Chancer Series 1,"Very much a product of the 1980's, this tale of the devious world of Banking and business in the UK looks just a little dated now with , for example, the 'cell phones' shown being the size of a brick! The plot revolves around a sly but very likeable Stepen Crane played by Clive Owen in his first starring role and it is he who makes the series very watchable with his limitless guile and charm. If you have experience of the business world you will probably find some of the plot a little far fetched but the characterisation is good and there are excellent performances from the supporting cast some of whom count in the pantheon of Britains finest actors such as Tom Bell, Leslie Phillips and Peter Vaughan. A particular treat for anyone in the US who finds the British way of doing things intriguing."
2,Where is my libretto?,"I know this is all about the music, but I do expect brand new box-set to have the libretto, period, no excuses, no questions asked. I've seen this production live, so I know the artists are of great quality, but I would not recommend this set without the libretto. I would not have bought it without the libretto, period. RCA should make it up to us somehow. Amazon people: You should have a way to indicate CLEARLY if the libretto is included or not, this is important stuff for us, opera lovers."
5,Wonderful,Best one yet. Will continue to buy as long as it is for sale. Love it great shine and great stuff
1,somewhat boring,Watched the DvD and found it repetitive and somewhat boring. There was a few good tips. Would rather have this in a book format.This might be good for the new quilter just learning how to put colors together.
4,Too big for my tastes,"I do like the ring, it is very pretty. I did not carefully read the size of the CZ on the ring. It is too big for my personal taste. If you like bling...this will be your thing. I like Gem Avenue's service and selection so I ordered a new ring with a smaller CZ. I like simplicity in jewelry. If you like a bigger sparkle then this will be the ring for you. It is very pretty and I do like the design of the ring. It was true to size and came in a lovely little box with a bow."
4,pycnogenol,I have found pycnogenol to be extremely helpful in decreasing pain from osteoarthritis in my lower back- it is definitely worth trying.
4,Are you sure you want a juicer????,"Bought this because of an article on juicing in better homes & gardens. Envisioned veggies turned to juice - yum! Well, we haven't had as much fun and good healthy exercise since Uncle Ed got et by the hogs. There's plenty of power! Throws veggies & fruit back at you thru the intake slot (duck fast) and flings pulp all over the walls & ceiling (good exercise cleaning up). Seriously, my kids & I had a real giggle trying it out. But what I really, really didn't like is probably true of all juicers - 98% of the input came out the ""pulp"" slot and 2% came out the juice slot. The juice was tasty, but most of the food I paid for was wasted. So I think I need some other kind of appliance.Otherwise, this seems to be a fine product, for what it does, if that's really what you want to do, which is why I gave it 4 stars even tho I will try to sell the one I bought on eBay."
4,satisfied consumer,this is a great product. I made a cake for my bf for our anniversary and he loved it. definitely recommend this pan!
4,A Classic War Book,"For anyone who is interested in a classic war book, written at a time when people knew and remembered World War II, this book is a must. It is also rare in that it is written from the perspective of Axis soldiers. A good companion to this book is the non-fiction book Black Edelweiss, about a combat SS soldier and his disillusionment as he learned what the SS and his country had done during the war."
2,Argument by Anecdote,"This book will not change one person's mind. Sticking to anecdotes, eschewing statistics and analysis, Baum strives to create an atmosphere of sinister conspiracy. But the simple fact that political spinmasters were involved in creating and selling the drug prohibition policy does not hopelessly discredit it. After all, politicians had to sell the Civil Rights Act, the New Deal, involvement in WWII, emancipation of the slaves, and everything else the government's ever done.Like most people who'd be motivated to seek out a book on the War on Drugs, I am sympathetic to Baum's general idea-- the War on Drugs goes too far, and a little treatment would sure go nice with, or maybe even in place of, locking up tons of people, many of whom are black. But to those of you looking for a balanced, informative overview of the history of the drug war, keep moving. This ain't it."
2,Same old song and dance,"I bought this album looking for their new album with the song ""hey there delilah"". My mistake, this album is nothing like the song I was looking for. This albums songs sound like every other recent punk / alternative garage band album that comes to mind in recent history. Each song strongly resembles the previous. Rerun after rerun. Repeat after repeat. Save your self the money buy the single from the other album."
5,Looks great....,"I bought this for work. I have a mailbox directory I print regularly and using push pins were becoming such a pain. I got this so that it would make changing individual pages easier and it does that exactly. I got this in the 96"" because the next size down was too short, but I was able to have our metal shop cut it down & it works great!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Fifty percent is better than nothing.At least that is what you are desperate enough to take if you hire Travis McGee as a 'Salvage Consultant', to recover something lost that may just be of dubious legality. (Not sure what he will do if it is a racehorse, woman, or parrot, however).Here, a friend asks him to help out another friend, both of whom are female dancers, and he reluctantly agrees, ending up in a sordid plot involving some treasure recovered in a now-jailed husband's army days, and a violent man (think rape and murder) trying to get his hands on it. Along the way, there is plenty of seedy Florida, broken women, and biffo.If you like this sort of adventurer with booze and broads style of thing, not much doubt you will find this enjoyable. Good stuff."
3,Deep Blue Goodbye,"This is the first Travis McGee book I have read, and it will likely be my last. The writing style is pretty good, but I find myself unable to care about the McGee character. I would not want to be him, as he seems to be living an empty, going-nowhere life. His lack of morals, especially related to sex, turns me off."
5,Simply the Best,"I have read all twenty-one Travis McGee novels and all are great. The Deep Blue Good-By is especially significant because it was the first. John D. MacDonald has shaped one of the most memorable detectives (eh, salvage consultants) in American fiction.McGee's philosophical sidebars and general commentaries on topics ranging from bikers, to bikinis, to beer, to sunsets give this character a depth that can not be found anywhere else. The storylines, however unrealistic, seem realistic. McGee does not always do the right thing. But who does. That's why we relate to Travis. When MacDonald died he took Travis McGee with him. But oh what a glorious ride it was."
2,Parts didn't work!,"I bought this toy for my nephew and had it shipped directly to him. There was no option of gift wrapping which I thought was too bad.I saw him recently and he had with him the listening device from the set. He told me that the pen and revealer worked but that the other thing did not. Sorry, I am at a loss for what that component actually was. I may try and send it back to the seller and try and get it replaced.For $40 dollars I don't think it is the best deal. 1 out of 4 didn't work - and they are just plastic!"
3,import elvis,English Elvis CDs do not have the same song arangements that US versions do. Those who grew up loving a certain Elvis album should stick with US versions.
5,a shining example of republican values,"Many issues have come up in this presidential campaign, one of them the family values represented by both sides. This book is a fine example of the fraud presented by President Bush's team. I find nothing wrong with the book other than the laughable dialog etc. but when the author's identity is considered it becomes downright insulting to listen to the republicans present themselves as the saviors of puritan ultra-traditional family values. How many times has Goerge W. been saved? 2, 3?"
1,A Spiritual Journey,"This is the symbolic tale of a lost man whose beautiful but enigmantic savior herself lives in the encroaching shadow of spiritual perdition. Her story is a powerful metaphor for the battle between the syncretistic/animist urges basic to man's animal nature (as represented by a ragged but tenacious feral dog), and the purifying revelation of an angry and vengeful Christian God. Never before has a political satire used the mysteries of female sexuality to such elaborate ends, and the mixture of slap-stick and black humor that forms the Sapphic sub-plot's unforeseen climax is a potent one the philosophical underpinnings of which unexpectedly fly in the face of traditional Republican values. Sadly the sloppy, ""deconstructionist""-inspired style makes much of this nearly impossible to extract, and it is only the roughest outline that emerges through the first several readings."
3,The book is OK,"This book was an OK read, but I bet we wouldn't be paying attention to it if the authors husband isn't Dick Cheney, the vice president. The characters are pretty 2 dimensional except for the main two. What is ironic is that they are homosexual (this is not one of the spoilers) and that issue has become a big deal because of the Cheneys daughter. I wonder what was going through her mind when she wrote it."
2,More than an erotic novel. Hold on to your copy,"This book is basically soft pornography in a western setting. Hold onto your copy because it's hard to find and expensive, I suppose due to the fact that erotic lesbian novels are not the kind of thing republicans like to brag about writing and it may have been held back from press, hence not a lot of copies are out there. Personally I find that rediculous, and it hasn't stopped a few from getting out anyhow. There's some sexual violence and lesbianism running throughout the story, but nothing terribly shocking. I suppose if you like soft porn or lesbian stories, with a touch of violence, and the old west, you might enjoy this tale. It's only worth buying for the political hypocrisy value, not as a crafted piece of literature imho."
2,Dissappointing,I was very much dissappointed in this purchase.It was not of the level I was looking for especially when it is a Syllabus book for studies with my Civil Aviation Authority. This is basic reading and seems to go way off track into turbines half way through the book. There are missing topics of importance with regards to the reciprocating engines.Try and review in a bookstore first but it does not meed the Grade for PPL Exams.
3,optima car battery alfa romero,I bought this car battery to replace a old worn out battery.I decided to use a less powered battery because I live in the west cost bay area.but what I didn't realize is the battery wasn't a direct fit .I had to cut and modify the holder that came with the battery.kinda hokey but it all works good after 2 months no problems.
5,The best song from Madonna.,"I heard this song on the radio. I started looking up the lyrics, and it was her. I was shocked to find out this was Madonna singing this song. I was relieved and happy to find the lyrics and who sang the song Take A Bow."
2,Misleading picture,"I got a scale with black numbers and dial - not red, like the scale in the picture you see. Looks bland, not worth the money I paid for it. Plastic parts. I am returning it right now."
2,Not as advertised,"We bought the scale for starting Weight watchers but it does not do weights in fractions i.e. 1/4 lb etc. Also it was not as pictured. The look of the scale(in the photo)was appealing because of the retro look with the red dial, ours came with a black dial which is just plane boring.Average thought...its just an average scale and nothing more."
4,Very good cd,"This is a very good cd. Starts out with moribound burgmeister, kind of orchestral in parts, then goes into a slow down and then picks up again. Solsbury Hill is my favorite Gabriel song great opening with 12 string guitar and excellent story line. Here Comes the flood is better on here than 16 golden greats..a little longer version. Dolce da vita is kind of hard rock with backing band in it. Modern love is a straight ahead rock song."
3,"Heavy duty bag, weak straps...","I got this about a year ago, and the shoulder strap snapped in about two months. The only reason I say this is because I don't use very much hardware, so the bag isn't really that heavy compared to what it could have weighed. If you are looking for a cheap durable bag, go for it ( just reinforce the shoulder strap)."
2,Melting handle,I purchased this pan to try out the glass ceramic titanium surface. It is a superior surface. We used the pan for 3 months. The problem arose the last time my wife used the pan. She was cooking in the kitchen and I began to smell melting plastic in the other end of the house. The smell lasted for days. There is no external damage to the handle. It must be occuring under the metal band that attaches the handle to the pan. I am afraid to use the pan again.
5,Scanpan Products,"You can't beat a Scanpan product! I use this square shape pan when making pancakes rather than hauling out my electric ""same shape"" electric fry pan which never did have such a good non-stick surface. The pan cleans up extremely easy. Product purchased through Amazon."
4,"12"" vinyl decription. U.S. Columbia","Columbia Red Label #44 07852 12"". Black sleeve with the hole to show the whole columbia label.

1,Complete letdown.,"I read this book expecting that it would be as entertaining as the first book by the same author.It started off reasonably enough, and held my interest till I was midway through. Suddenly, though, it's as if the author hit writer's block, or just decided he couldn't be bothered to think anymore.A series of ludicrious plot twists later, the book abruptly ended. It really was abrupt - a bunch of trails led nowhere, a ton of strings left dangling, bizarre twists to the story, and a completely nonsensical end.I don't think I'll be paying for anymore of Mr. Mathur's books for a while.I'd recommend reading this book if someone pays you well to do it - otherwise your time is better spent doing anything else."
4,Excellent,"This is Zappa's last major work, made on a synclaver, a computer orchestra. Zappa was sick most of the time he worked on this and so was unable to tour. Besides, he was tired of having to manage a band.The complex patterns -probably the most so of all of Zappa's work-are perfect here; if you think of those complex little passages Zappa inserted into countles songs, and extend these rhythm knots into full tracks, this is what this music sounds like.Zappa also inserts dialouge, both new and from 1967's Lumpy Gravy sessions.Civilazation III is facinating on it's own terms. Zappa said human beings could not play this score correctly, but it would be interesting for a band to try.`"
4,A UNIQUE RETELLING OF THE CHRISTMAS STORY,"Warsaw born Jan Pienkowski grew up in a family of architects and artists. Fortunately for us, especially the younger readers, he inherited their gifts in good measure.His latest is a Christmas carousel book illustrating the story of the first Christmas with three dimensional cut-out silhouettes. The cheery book, which measures 5 3/4"" by 10"", utilizes holiday colors of green, red, and white. The silhouettes are white showcased against a bright shiny red background, and finely edged in gold.Ties, which enable the book to be secured when opened are sturdy with shoestring ends, and there is a loop for hanging. When hung the carousel measures approximately 9"" in diameter.Youngsters will enjoy having their own telling of the Christmas story, in this unique, eye catching form.- Gail Cooke"
4,i love this flash drive,this flash drive helps me out alot since my cruzser has a lot of stuff on it help me with my college assignment and helps me back them up with no problem wat so ever
4,Read then Shop,"The author wrote an excellent guide for music lovers interested in picking up the electric guitar and learning how to play. The choices in electric guitars and their features can be daunting to a beginner looking at an intimidating wall full of of ""axes"" and dealing with a salesperson that may only be interested in moving merchandise. The author manages to present the shopping/learning experience in a simple yet thorough manner. Having read the book and being introduced to the lingo, I feel much more comfortable immersing myself in the world of electric guitars. I also recommend Hilton's guide to amps -- the equipment that will bring your guitar to life."
5,Wonderful Book,"If you longed for a book that was interesting and informative, this is the book for you. Eleanor was a clear thinker with a sense of duty that appears unmatched in today's world. My father thought the world of Mrs Roosevelt, and after reading this book, I understand why. She is selfless and tireless, and her bio is honest and thoughtful. My wife is not a big history buff, and she came away from this book with a new sense of understanding for the period of time Eleanor talks about. Everything you wish in a biography, cannot say enough good things about it."
4,Succinct and Informative,"This book is very succinct and the explanations for each accounting concepts are very easy to understand and easy to remember. The ""Red Flags"" after each concept are very useful in pointing out all the possible problems that may arise. While the strengths of this book is his conciseness, it does require you to have some basic accounting background. Otherwise, some of the explanations may seem confusing. Having said that, if i am reading an annual report, I would definitely want to have this book beside me. Happy reading!"
3,very cheap,The plastic is very cheap and opens easy. Kinda bulky for what is inside the case. It would be ok for 5 bucks
3,"Anorexia and Bulimia, but not Binge.","Janet Bode, Food Fight (Simon and Schuster, 1997)I never realized how many books there are about children and eating disorders until I went looking for them. Among them, Food Fight stands out because it's the only one I've found so far that's actually written for the children, rather than the parents.Unfortunately, as I am finding seems to be the case with most books of this nature, the author defines ""eating disorders"" quite narrowly as anorexia and bulimia, only mentioning binge eating disorder in passing a time or two.Thus, this may well be an excellent book for children with those diseases (and their parents), but for parents of children with other eating disorders, its use will be questionable. **"
5,Pablo and Friends,"I first heard Pablo playing rhythm guitar on a Sam Mangwana track in the early 80's, and later tweaking the bass with Les Quatre Etoiles. Here he gets to do abit of everything, with the support of a few reliable musician colleagues, namely guitarists Diblo Dibala, Daly Kimoko, Syran M'Benza and Lokassa, and vocalists Wuta Mayi, Shimita, and Lea Lignanzi. The result is a fast paced rendering of Pablo's compositions, Paris-style.Check out UP TO DANCE (track 4) for modern Soukous Stars pace featuring Daly, or try PENSE A MOI (track 7) for a more retro Afric ambiance with Syran.Total music: 56 minutes"
4,Zeke,Fast full throttle songs. I liked this cd more than most of there other ones.Sounds alot like the Dwarves to me.
1,Not for solid modeling beginners!,"The book is poorly organized, missing instructions, and difficult to follow. It is too incomplete for beginners & too elementary for intermediates & professionals."
4,The business of organised crime in the USA,"I first watched this series when it was broadcast back in the 80s here in Australia. I was impressed then and am still so on rewatching now. The story is told in a no nonscence way, imformative at not over dramatic. Naturally the whole thing is dated but this does not lessen the impact. The Mafia are not glamourised or portrayed as Robin Hood types. Some of the other series I have re organised crime have been critised for incorrect pronunciation of the names of the various old time hoodlums. I did not notice this here. In any event such critism seems to me to be petty. This set is unlikely to be seen in university libraries, however it is informative and entertaining. If you make the choice to purchase it you will be able to compare the real facts with the Hollywood version. Enjoy!"
3,Is it that great?,"I bought this album in hopes that I'd find another modern band that is still focused on actually being good musicians and playing great shows. I have to say that I was highly dissapointed by this disc. With all the comparisons to the Allman Brothers, Phish, and gratefull dead (which are all bands I love) floating around this band I figured this must be some sort of supergroup. But I only found 2 songs that I really liked on it, ""Porch Song"" and ""Coconuts"". The two bonus tracks were pretty good too. But if anyone can recomend a better album than this buy Widespread, please email me. Thanks"
2,Could be better.,"I rely on my digital kitchen timer/ thermometer on a daily basis, even when not cooking. I was excited when I bought this to replace the last one, but I was disappointed with the quality of this one. The buttons are sluggish. The timer count-down does not continue once it reaches zero; you could not see on this one how much time has past the preset point. It is handy when you know it's been 1 or 3 minutes past the set time, so you could adjust your cooking time. It has a clock mode but I already have 2 other clocks in the kitchen (on microwave oven and radio) so I don't need it. Finally it does not have seconds setting, or at least 1/2 minute setting, which I also use a lot. It works, but its design is not great. I will keep this one, and hope it breaks soon so I can get a better one."
1,Nice while it lasted...,"The probe quit working halfway thru the Thanksgiving turkey on my 6 week old thermometer. Later, after looking at reviews of other Polder thermometers, I found out that the probes don't make it thru more than a few meals before failing. I was going to order a replacement but think I'll just throw the piece of junk away."
1,Not too durable,"After fewer than six uses the probe has failed. Since I cannot find a replacement this once useful tool goes into the dumpster. Great idea, non durable implementation."
5,Stunning DIDO,"This is one of the CDs which you can play from start to end. Pleasure for your ears and yourself! Music & lyrics are both very much to satisfy your aesthetics, but you probably know this all already. Infact, the purpose of writing this review is not-to-repeat what every one have already said.Just want to mention/warn about the content in CDs, especially if you are buying it because it is enhanced with video and other pictorial contents. A word of caution, the videos included are in QuickTime format and nearly impossible to play full screen. So unless you are a die-hard fan of dido and you want this one anyways, go for it otherwise buy the regular version.and yeah, i forgot to mention the five stars! :-)"
4,Passionate and soothing,"I bought this album because ""Here With Me"" isn't on single. It's the theme song to ""Roswell"" and I couldn't get it out of my head. On a whole the cd is very good. It's obvious Dido has a R&B background. ""Here With Me"" is intensely passionate, the vocals incredible. Also, ""Don't Think of Me"" stands out as a very sassy message. Vocally it is very sweet and melodious with a mean-spirited, 'who's-sorry-now' message a la Natalie Merchant's ""Jealousy."" Can't be enough songs like that. Why there are no single or radio plays is baffling. Clearly that's where Dido need s to be. An hour with this CD is time well spent."
5,One of the best CDs of 1999,"I have had this CD over a year now, and it's one of the few of my collection that I can listen to from beginning to end several times over and never get tired of it. If you like this I highly recommend checking out the soundtrack to ""Sliding Doors"" on which her song ""Thank You"" appears and her early pre-solo work with the group Faithless. My favorite track is the song ""Hunter"" about a girl affirming her independence, which is a great anthem for me being a chick on her own. Other highlights: ""Here With Me,"" ""Thank You,"" and ""No Angel."""
5,Voice of angel,"Her voice is amazing.Those song are soft like: Thank you, My lover's gone etc.And the songs I like the most are Here with me, Don;t think of me,Thank you,All you and I'm no angel.It help you to relax!"
2,too much chaff,"This will go into the one hit wonder bin of your favorite record store. Aside from ""Thank You,"" everything else is chaff; filler for a dismal CD. It's too European for me, which is rhythmically confusing, like trying to stay on the road while you drive standing on your head. I don't want to say it's rhythmically challenged, but it's so different, so foreign except for ""Thank You."""
4,Very good album,"This album is pretty good but somehow it seems not as good as I expected when I heard ""Here with Me"". I know I shouldn't just run out to buy an album for just one song but I did with this one. I usually find at least two songs I like before buying a cd.The lyrics are there, except it sounds as if she's just talking really fast for long lyrics to accomodate the music. I know I shouldn't criticize the way how someone speaks but sometimes I have a hard time understanding her to, I think, the southern accent."
5,very cool,"if it lost east CD to return it to buy the times that were necessary the favorite songs of dido is here I recommend, it, thanks"
3,A cross between:,"A cross between Sarah McLachlan and Suzanne Vega. Musically a tad bit of Portishead. (don't ask) I bought both ""No Angel"" and ""Life For Rent"" and they're pretty good albums. ""White Flag"" is a great, catchy song. I really thought it was Sarah McLachlan for the first few times I heard it though. It's good listening music. Dido has tremendous talent and defiantly room to grow. If your into the acts I mentioned in this post, then give Dido a try. Good stuff. Look forward to more."
5,Dido is one of the greatest new artists out there...,"Well, my title pretty much sums everything up. The bottome line is that Dido has such a great voice and it goes so well with her music. I sometimes think that she is underrated, or unrecognized, but she deserves recognition. She is very talented and her whole album proves it."
4,Mood Music for the Soul,"I think that you have to be in a certain mood for certain music. This is one of those types of music that you need to be in the mood for. I like the other reviews on this CD, but at the same time, I know that I really like this CD. I started listening to Dido when she did the song with Eminem, but I was more interested in her song than the rap that Eminem did (hailing from detroit, I must give props on Eminem on a song that with less airplay might have actually carried some meaning) but anyways, I listened to the rest of the album and realized that ""thank you"" was really only the tip of the iceberg. She is very talented and spending the $12.00 is well worth it if you remotely like what you have heard on the radio.As one very famous quote goes ""Good music is what you like"". Whether this CD is technically sound, or congruent is irrelevant, the fact that it is good is."
4,A MUST HAVE if you like singing in the car!,"I LOVE this album. It is sweet, effortless and calming. The first two tracks are my favorite, and yes I do love the ever-popular and overplayed ""Thank You"". I first discovered DIDO when I heard the song ""Thank You "" sampled in EMINEM's song ""Stan"". The album is worth every penny. Her voice reminds me of a cross between Sarah Mclaughlin and Jewel. (Did I spell that right?) the reason I gave this album only four stars is simply because the first few times you listen to it..alot of the songs sound the same. However, the more you listen to it, the more each song develops it's own identity. I love belting out Jewel song's in the car until I drive my friends mad when I can't hit the high notes. It is, to their relief that DIDO has a smooth, easy to sing-to voice....everybody's happy now!"
2,"Good voice, bad music.","First of all, don't get me wrong... I think Dido has a wonderful voice, she clearly has talent. However, after listening to her CD a couple of times I began to notice that her lyrics are kind of cheesy and stupid. The fact that she doesn't write any of her own music was very apparent, and she sounded emotionally flat to me. Dido music is like a bright shiny apple that's rotten all the way to the core. It's music with no soul. Try Ani Difranco, Fiona Apple, or Tori Amos instead... they actually feel what they're singing."
4,"A Solid, Hypnotic Album","This album by Dido is beautifully crafted and the lyrics are lovely. All her music seems grounded by a strong techno-beat which still manages to highlight the artist's own voice. I could foresee ""Take My Hand,"" for example, to be played in a dance club but also in the privacy of my own home. You can take her album and music along with you wherever you go. I only wish she was less restrained and mellow in singing and more willing to use her inner lion."
5,GREATEST CD OF 1999,"AFTER READING THE REVIEW OF COMPARING HER TO OTHER MUSCIANS, DIDO IS DIDO--UNIQUE, AWESOME AND GREAT TO LISTEN AND LEARN. SHE TALKS OF LIVING AND LIFE AND THE DILEMAS WE MUST ALL FACE AT ONE TIME OR OTHER. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS ONE CD FOR YOU--YOU WONT REGRET IT"
5,Best cd i have!,"This is an awesome cd! I luv every song! It's really good, if you like sarah mclachlan, or actually if you just love music you'll luv this!"
5,One of My Favorites,"The first half of Dido's ""No Angel"" is exquisite - in sequence, mood, voice, atmosphere, you name it. The production and writing on songs like ""Here With Me"", ""Hunter"" and ""Thank You"" are stunning, and Dido's voice is smooth, creamy and relaxing - it is like warm nutritious food for these songs - and not a hair too hot or too cold.Tracks 7 - 12, though just as well done, didn't hold my attention nearly as well as the first six, which in my opinion, deserved a much better follow up. Instead they seemed to water down what could have been released as a great, mood-enhancing EP.Even so, this album remains among my collection of faves. And Dido's seemingly ego-less attitude is a rarity in the music business... she was lucky to be the target of sampling by Eminem and she knows it. She talks about it in the press all the time, and for that reason alone my respect for her remains."
5,Amazing,"I bought Dido's CD ""No Angel"" a year ago and still haven't gotten tired of it. Her lyrics are emotional and real, the music is funky and cool, and I just love every song on the album. ""Here With Me"" is beautiful and ""Honestly OK"" just sweeps me away with its honesty. I love Dido and this CD. She is kind of like a techno-enhanced Sarah McLachlan but more real-feeling. It's like she's talking right to you and you can both feel and understand her pain or sadness or happiness. Plus with her throaty vocals that get you right in the soul, this CD is just awesome."
3,A Pleasing Surprise,"Originally I bought this CD for 'Here With Me' - the theme song from WB's 'Roswell'. Apart from that I had never heard from Dido. I am now totally in love with them! Including 'Here With Me', the top tracks from this CD are 'Hunter' and 'Honestly Ok'. Sorry to typecast, but if you're into Sarah Mclachlan and Lillith Fair, or even if you just like mellow music with amazing vocals, go for Dido. You'll love it."
2,Disappointed with Dido,"I don't know what I expected from this album, but I certainly didn't get it. Although Dido may appeal to others, she didn't with me. Her lyrics were well written, but Dido just seemed to talk her way through the songs. The music didn't seem to have any beat and was kind of like a mix matched bunch of tunes that you can't straighten out in your head. I must admit I bought it for the Roswell theme song ""Here with Me"". That seemed like the only worthy song to listen to. I don't mean to make Dido sound like the worst artist in the world; she has potential. But she did not win me over with ""No Angel""."
2,Time to Sleep...(I Blame Eminem),"I understand why so many people like Dido..She is beautiful, has a decent voice, comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive...This album is the same - 'inoffensive'...some might say, bland...The tracks that work for me are 'Thank You' (used on Eminem's 'Stan'), but is done solo here and it works, 'Hunter' and 'Here With Me'...The rest just disappear into the background like a passing car...Nothing much happens, nothing inspires...I really want to like her, but it's all been done before..."
1,Dido - the great rip-off,"In a time when generic, uninspired rip-off bands are called ""fresh"", ""unique"" and ""original"" it should be no surprise that someone would get around to ripping off Sarah McLachlan. Dido is that rip-off.Her vocal style, the musical style, everything, is evocative of Sarah McLachlan. A pity, too, because she has a good voice and could stand on her own without resorting to mimicking a greater performer's style."
5,Great Relaxing Music,"I bought this album well before the Eminem debut......Thinking about it, I bought it in March of 2000 at a small store called Soundwaves in Houston.The point is, small stores find these gems way before the radio and mass media does. I personally liked the beats and thought her voice was great. I don't listen to the album much anymore as I have listened to it a zillion times and it is way overplayed on the radio.However, I did listen to this CD to relax. I found that popping in this disk, shutting down the lights and kicking on the scented candles allowed me to get through some very tense times. Other CD's listened to that provided great vocals and good beats are Chicane - behind the sun and Sarah Brightman's Eden album. For the record, I didn't even know who Brightman was when i bought the album. I just liked the beats and thought her voice was great, just like Dido's. Only the opposite was the truth!"
3,Has a few good songs,"This is a good album, but I only liked a couple of songs, and I really liked only one (Here With Me). that's unfair though, since I'm not only a man but am also not a big fan of vocal music (I like heavy beats and lots of yelling). My wife likes it, though, and she plays it all the time. The music doesn't bug me, let me assure you, but I just want to warn you ahead of time that if this isn't your normal musical taste, you'll bother to learn the words to ""Here With Me"" and none of the others. Well, there I feel better. Uh oh... Here comes my wife..."
3,"A reserved ""Great.""","I chanced upon this album in the local music store's preview listening booth, and loved the combination of simple yet magical lyrics, full and infusing beats and a certain tragic quality. It is a great album, but the the more I listened to it the more I had a sense that every track was about keeping a partner on a leash, enjoying a partner who was not straining on teh leash, or grieving a partner who had gotten off the leash (except the second track, where Dido herself wants to get off the leash). Get past this theme and enjoy."
4,Simply Beautiful,"I initially bought this album simply because of ""Here With Me"", the theme from Roswell, but the rest of the songs are just as amazing. This is a great CD to relax to or sing along with, and the music gives me goosebumps combined with the lyrics.She has a very distinctive voice and style, and I hope she brings us more with a second album!"
5,My Top 5,I bought this cd last year for myself and have just recently purchased it again for my sister as a present. I play this cd at least twice a week. This is one of my favorites if I had to choose 5 of my collection. I can't wait for another release from Dido.
5,Eternal Classic,"Try as I might to stay aware of new artists, my inability to listen to maintstream FM-radio (i.e, Brittany and Backstreet are my idea of the tenth circle of Hell), coupled with the inevitability of aging (""don't trust anyone over 30...I mean 40... uh.....""), means that I don't always find out about new artists unless something new and wonderful gets used in a soundtrack, which I then have to hunt down. I'm happy to say that the gods finally smiled upon me last week, since the only time in ages that I happened to surf by VH-1 a video from ""No Angel"" was playing. I bought the CD immediately, and have played it ad nauseum since. Dido's voice is amazing. The creativity she shows in her music reminds me strongly of artists like Kate Bush (anyone else remember how cool ""Wuthering Heights"" was?)and Sarah MacLachlan. Dido more than holds her own with ""No Angel,"" however, regardless of the inevitable comparisons to other artists. She was a welcome discovery for me."
3,"Pleasing, but not perfect.","Here with Me, Hunter, and Thank You quickly became favorites of mine in listening to No Angel. All three stand out greatly from the general sound of the songs on this c.d. While most of Dido's songs are pleasing to listen to, most of them don't really stand out and grab your attention. A few are downright bad; Don't think of me is bland, and Honestly Ok seems to be weird for the sake of being weird as it features approximately 1:30 of strange, random instrument noises. I would definitely say that if you want to be free of the norm of today's music, which seems to be mainly swearing and feral screaming, buy this."
4,"Powerful, angelic and moving","Here with me, is the song generally heard on the radio but chances are you heard Dido on the introduction to the WB's Roswell and her editted version of Thank you on the movie Sliding Doors. She has a sound that almost echos in a haunting sort of way that encourages you to pay attention to every sound she makes. A great CD for those who enjoy Sarah and Tori."
5,Great for an afternoon on your own!,This is a great album for an afternoon on your own. I particularly like All You Want and Don't Think of Me. Two very great tracks.
2,What's up?,"I really don't know what's goin'on with all the lines about this album! It's a Pop album, not very bad but it offers no new sounds... It's the ""same old song and dance"". The lyrics are absolutely ordinary, no melody at all... So, this is a sold out Pop album. Don't waste too much time with this."
3,Average,"This is never going to be one of my favorite albums (I mean, come on, the woman's got over fifty pictures of herself plastered all over the booklet and jewel case), but it's not too bad, either. It's a fun little disc, not too deep, good for listening to at parties or when background noise is needed. Dido has a great voice, and it's best put to use on songs like Isobel and Here With Me. Nothing to get too excited about, but nothing to hate violently, either."
4,"Great CD, unique style","This is a really good album. When I first bought it I was really unsure of it, and it took a few listens until I really got hooked. Dido has an awesome voice, and it is also very unique."
3,THE BOOK,"I DID CHOOSE THIS RATING , THE PRODUCT IT IS OKAY BUT MY KIDS LIKE MORE THE MOVIE TO READ SOMETHING ."
5,A truly classic tale,"One of the best fantasy books of all time -- don't let the subject matter fool you; this book is as enjoyable for an adult as for a kid. Even moreso, perhaps, because an adult reader will pick up on the subtleties -- themes of hope, despair, of the endurance of mystery and fantasy in the world, of what it means to be noble and heroic, or how to find one's place in the world -- and a few touches of truly wonderful metatheatricality. So very highly recommended."
5,250 page epic. Beautiful and bittersweet.,"Buy this if you like original, well-written, heart-breaking, breath-taking, tightly-plotted fantasy. Don't buy it if you like bloated serial Tolkein rip offs."
5,Breaks your heart while making it soar...,"I've now read this book twice, and I've started to read it a third time. I never ever read books more than once, even when I think they are excellent. This book never fails to make me cry, even though it seems to lack great tragedy. This book is simply so beautiful that it makes you cry. On the surface it is a child's story, but beneath the fairy tale exterior lies a testimonial to truth, love, life, and lost innocence. Do not read this book and let the deeper meaning evade you. If you enjoy this book I highly reccomend the animated movie version of it, which is also remarkably beautiful, while leaving out some important details. Also, I'd like to inform other TLU lovers that a live action movie is in the making and will be released in Fall/Winter 2003. This version will not be made after the original animated movie, but will be more thoroughly based on the book itself. I, and other fans, are eagerly awaiting its arrival."
5,Great!,"I gave it five stars because it arrived quickly and didn't have any wear that I noticed. Lovely book, great Christmas present. Thanks a lot!"
2,Identity Crisis,"Beagle is a gifted writer and the story line is original with great potential. Unfortunately, the telling of the story can't decide if it is fantasy or parody. Or perhaps it is parody and I wanted it to be fantasy. Beagle builds beautiful images with his prose only to topple them with flippant dialog and pointless actions. The ending is completely unsatisfying. Throughout the story, tension builds over the Red Bull, the nemesis of the unicorn, but when a confrontation takes place, the scene dissipates benignly and the story coasts to a bittersweet end.There are many elements here to enjoy, so it is worth the read; just don't expect too much. If you're looking for good fantasy, keep looking."
4,Amazon not sending what they advertise,"Ordered two of these 3A black leather racing seats....overall really nice...BUTwhat Amazon sent me was not what was advertised...They show a photo of a seat that has a lever that is usedto adjust the back position...down where the back meets the bottom...What Amazon sent me was a hand operated wheel that is almostimpossible to adjust without being out of the seat...Afterwards...when I emailed the problem to the Amazon's CS dept...they saidthat I would have to return these (at my expense)...Mailing back these seats is not an option, as they weigh almost 50 lbs...So they offered to refund 20% of the cost...which does help ease the pain some...but I wanted seats that had levers...not hand wheels...SO...the moral of the story is...make sure that Amazon guarantees that what they will sendis what is pictured...otherwise...Amazon cannot be trusted"
5,The Insecurity of buying used books,the book arrived in excellent like new condition. i was very happy with it and the prompt shipping service.
3,tedious to read,It gives me the information I was looking for but it is not easy reading and just too many repeats of the same subject. But overall informative.
2,Dissapointment,"I know that there is percussion music that is worth listening to, I've played some. Unfortunately, such music is not found on this CD. The songs are either ragtime (which is fine in appropriate amounts) or wierdo garbage that must be more interesting to play than it is to listen to, otherwise I can't see how it would make it onto a ""best of"" CD. I don't recall hearing a piece that had both drums and keyboards at the same time. I admit, however, that I haven't built up the courage to listen to the disk again to verify this. In long... the song selection is really bad and most of the sounds coming from the speakers are best kept in the background of B grade horror films. The talent of the players is wasted on the material."
5,super tight super rare,this is a classic album that is out of print.i have one UNOPENED and will sell for a reasonable price.drop me an email.
3,Heavy on text,"I was curious about what kind of garden publications Chronicle Books would be putting out so I bought three in the series; Water Gardens, Paths and Walkways, and Small Patios.I think if I had seen these in the bookstore I would've probably put them back. I was expecting something a little heavier on the visuals from Chronicle Books.But the examples are interesting. Nice range of elements, and tending to favor the quirky in design. The author describes the garden element in question (depends on which book you have) and uses one overall photograph and two detail shots. The detail shots seem there mostly for atmosphere and to break up the page. She also includes a one-page, how-to discussion, and a list of tools and materials.I'm not looking forward to all the reading."
5,Elvis' best,"Simply put, this is Elvis' best album. This is a great matching-one of the best voices ever paired with the memphis sound of the late sixties. Quality songs, great vocals, quality music. The King lives..."
2,Easily Stuck when Shredding Multiple Pages,"It generally works fine. But when you want to shred more than 6 pages (the stated limit is 11), or have a few thick pages with your normal pages to shred - watch out! The cutter will get stuck and then get overheat. You will then spend a few hours just trying to pull out the papers...I think a compulsory design for all shredders should be that whatever paper you can put throught the opening in 1 go, the shredder should be able to shred it. Period.I just smashed mine. The time I spent pulling the papesr out and getting the shredder to work is much more than simply tearing the papers by hand."
4,Informative,I feel this is a well written book and is informative for anyone looking to improve their meals and self.
2,Poor build quality,"Magnets are sufficient to hold it on a surface, but if you put the timer on the door of a fridge, the timer may fly off. After 2-3 drops to the ground, the plastic casing broke. Taped back together, still works. A few months later one of the magnets came off. This timer now sits in a drawer, unused."
5,Gail Ranstrom is on my MUST read list.,"Saving Sarah proved that Gail Ranstrom is a writer of heroes I fall in love with and heroines I fantasize about being. These are stories of strong men -- and women strong enough to be their match. Saving Sarah was such a different couple than Ms. Ranstrom's first book, A Wild Justice, yet they were as vivid and real as any I've read.Plotting is one of Ms. Ranstrom's strong suits. I enjoy a page turner and this one kept me burning the midnight oil. The language swept me up and away and I was sorry when it was over.I can't wait for her next one!"
4,Great Journal,"I received this particular journal on my 11th birthday the day after AoTC was released. I've written in it for 10 years. And for most of those years it really held up, but then the outer cover fell off from the spiral notebook inside. It's not too much of a problem because by that time I'd reached the last page. But perhaps it is durable, because I a kid and then a teen and then an adult was able to use it just fine before 2 years ago.It's a great journal though, the little stories inside were cute and I look back and can see my own pretend stories that I'd made (I apparently lived on a planet next to Tatooine and became a jedi lol). There's a lot of pages, so there's also lots of space to write or draw.Great journal, I ordered another that I hope to fill over the next decade."
4,Spanish Track a Bonus,"This is one of the few Dora DVDs with a Spanish language track (oddly). It's the same voices as the Spanish version of Dora on TV, so our kids are definitely hooked! (Twins, bilingual boys)There is lots of Diego on this DVD - and he does weird talking to the animal stuff (might be better in English).Overall, good stuff"
2,Traditional Catholic Sisters,"This book gives a detailed explanation of the difference between traditional Catholic Sisters and those who have updated their lives and works according to Vatican II recommendations. Public documents are quoted at length, but the writer's use of private communications as well as her own ""take"" on those Sisters who have changed their lifestyles are often unsupported.While Carey is certainly entitled to her views, the book would have more substance if the style were academic and her language a little less restrained in discussing groups whose actions reflect a worldview quite different from her own."
4,Probably the best you can expect from these guys,"If you were to only buy one Kottonmouth Kings album, this would have to be it. Altough in my opinion it has alot of filler songs(songs not meant to be great but good enough for hardcore fans). This cd best represents the group and acts like an introduction into their type of genre. Songs which are the most notable are as follows;Sleeper- A fast-paced intro into the world of suburb-pop-punk-hip hop which this group seems to engulf itself in.Rest of my life- A classic stoner tune in every aspect. Even if you don't smoke weed, you'll catch yourself singing along.Strange Dayz- A great example of how KMK can get down lyrically with a hard hip-hop flavor.Tangerine Sky- My personal favorite, call it ska, punk, or even hip-hop. Something about KMK can appeal to just about anybody."
4,A different sound,"This is a different sound for the kings but still is good. There are a few songs with great guitar riffs and some retro sounding melodies, which i really seem yo like. (Rest of my life, tangerine sky, waking dream) They still got some hardcore hip-hop stuff too that is also is great..u got it all the punk, rock, rap, hip hop. Thats why I love them so much they are not just stuck to playing one type of music they vary their style and really expose you to many types. Go Buy this CD you'll be glad you did."
1,BAD IS BAD,"A terrible transfer to DVD. The VHS wasn't the best in the world either. But, it is an Andy Warhol film and Joe Dallesandro is in it, as he has been in other Warhol films. Supposedly, another transfer to DVD is going to happen soon? Will wait and see. It is a comedy and the story is funny. But, the DVD is too sad to watch, (quality wise). A young Perry King also stars as well as Carroll Baker (""Baby Doll""). Hopefully, a restored DVD will soon be in the making."
4,"Great movie, DVD quality is fine.","Since most reviews here are negative towards the CheesyFlicks edition of Andy Warhol's Bad and not the content of the film, I thought I should chime-in to say that the quality is just fine. This is an underground movie and has an underground movie ""look."" The quality is acceptable and looks better than the VHS editions out there.I also did not experience any technical difficulties with this DVD, nor did I have any delays in service from the seller ""CheeezyFlicks."" I'm grateful to finally have this film on DVD."
2,Poor excuse for swing,"Brian Setzers guitar and vocals coupled with poor production dround out the rest of the musicians. I wonder if there is actually an orchestra backing him up? Save your money. Buy Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Bill Elliot Swing Orchestra, Cherry Poppin Daddies, Royal Crown Review, Colin James, any album by any of these artists is better than this and you can actually hear the other musicians. I liked the Stray Cats. Somehow his style does not suit this music. Setzer is basically a solo act. I get the feeling that he is not comfortable sharing the stage with other musicians. For me a one man swing band just does not work. I traded this CD for a David Wilcox. Nice CD, powerful raunchy guitar and vocals and he doesn't call it the David Wilcox Orchestra."
3,More of the same?,"I must agree with my esteemed colleague from Lombard, IL. I enjoyed a few of the tracks but started to feel like I was listening to the same songs from other albums- many of them sound very similar. I did enjoy ""Americano"" and ""Drive Like Lightning"" though. If you want to start a swing collection, I'd buy Dirty Boogie or Guitar Slinger rather than this one."
1,"That's not music that's noise, as Grandpa used to say...","This isn't swing, in fact as Grandpa used to say, it's not music it's noise. I may only be 21 years old but I know the difference between swing and Elvis Presley influenced rock-a-billy. And Brian Setzer isn't a swing or jazz artist he's a oppritunist who's using the swing fad to make a few bucks, the only problem is he's not playing swing. Another thing Gramps tought me the dofference between good music and bad music, just listen to Jelly Roll Morton & His Red Hot Peppers or Fats Waller & His Rhythm Makers, or Louis Armstrongs Hot Fives and Sevens, then listen to Brian Setzer, you'll realize how talentless he really is.Please try these 4 CD's 1st:Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives & Sevens Volume One (Columbia) Jelly Roll Morton & His Red Hot Peppers: Chicago 1926-28(RCA) Fats Waller-The Joint Is Jumpin' (RCA/Bluebird) McKinney's Cotton Pickers 1928-29 (Classics)See for yourself..."
1,This really sucks rotten eggs!,"This is worst cd by Brian Setzer, i like his other cd before this one, the Dirty Boogie, but this one is really bad. Too much rap, and not enough swing. I agree with other reviewer this cd should never have been released."
1,Not typical of Brian setzer,"This is NOT typical swinging Setzer, for intead of swaggering horns and hot guitar solos, you get hip hip, rap and techno mixed with otherwise good music. Too bad Setzer's producers made him make this such a commerical release, go for The Dirty boogie instead."
1,The worst swing cd of all time,"Buy thsi if you want to laugh, like a loon!!! HEEEEE HEEEE HHEEEEEEEE He does Glenn Milelr songs and adds, rap, hahahaha ,and it's rap that is insulting to people who liek rap, it sounds liek it's making fun of rappers, really cheezzy stuff. Buy his latest live cd isntead, but skip thsi one please!!!!"
5,"more albums, please!","I'm not a music critic, so I can't clearly spell out all the reasons why The Hillary Step is one of my favorite bands, and why this is such a great album. All I know is that the music moves me, makes me smile, is smart, touching and really catchy. ""Olio"" is one of the most beautiful songs in my whole collection, and really demonstrates the way all three vocalists work together to give this band a rich, full sound.I could spend forever trying to figure out what bands they sound like. They don't. Their sound is all their own. Just listen to their songs for yourself and you'll become another fan!"
2,Do Not Judge This book By It's Cover!,"As my title to this review suggests the photos inside are not on par with the cover! this is a nice book of B&W photos of parts of the female form, some are even in focus. The majority of the models inside are thin to the point of their ribs show even when not streching. most have small breast and do not have the almost hourglass figure of the cover model. Sure there is a small precent of the models inside that are as well proportioned and pretty as the cover model, but it is a small precentage. Also in the cover shot the surroundings/landscape inhances the female form and does not that your attention elsewhere, whereas inside many of the photos the surrondings detract or even obscure the model. I am a photographer and I can appreciate most any part of the female form as the subject in a photo (although I prefer the whole more), but many of the photos here look as if taken by a high school student the frist time they ever photographed a nude model."
1,Doesn't live up to the cover,"I purchased this book hoping for some inspiration for my art. Most of the photos are so far away, the model isn't much more than a speck. Other ones are so dark and/or blurry that you can't tell if it's a woman or a man. The cover is probably the best photo. I plan on reselling my copy. I was very disappointed in this book."
3,"Good for modern songs, bad for older ones.","The author should quote his sources, because others in the future may take his statements for fact, when some of the stories are not backed up by other authors / researchers. I have found conflicting information about some of the music both in print and online. A Google search will lead you to different versions and also different background info on ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"", for example. Also, though I am no musicologist, I would consider a christmas song as being secular, and a christmas carol as being about sacred topics, i.e. Jesus, Joseph, and Mary. In contrast, The ""Reader's Digest Merry Christmas Songbook"" is pretty good about (briefly) explaining the backgound / history of the selections (plus it has the music) and almost every one of the popular songs, but it does not always have all of the verses of the songs."
5,Purely excellent,Just an excellent book on the songs of Christmas. Something to hand down from children to grandchildren.
1,More Urban Myth and history,"""Stories"" is the right beginning for this book. I bought the book to save myself some time doing internet research and found I have to do it all anyway because the author simply repeats the urban legend stories that are cute but unfortunately often very inaccurate.Read it for fun, not history."
3,Was hard to read,"This was a great idea for a book, and has some interesting stories in it. The big flaw with it is that the actually printing in the book is blue and makes it physically hard to read. It started to hurt my eyes after a little while. But it may just be me."
3,Engaging but Brief,"At first glance this 58-page, unadorned book was not impressive. Once the reading of it had begun, however, I found I could not put it down until I had read the final page. It clearly described the immediate terrors and frustrations of the early American colonists in the Virginia settlements with the greedy, self-absorbed English Governor on the one side and the hostile, sometimes brutal, Native American tribes on the other side. The author gives a play-by-play account of the events as they occurred giving the reader a brief sense of being there. The only reason I have for giving this book a rank of 3 lies in it's abrupt end and lack of details about dates, places and participants. While I learned a great deal more about the lives of the colonists at the time of Bacon's Rebellion, I did not learn anything more of those who gave their lives in this prelude to the Revolutionary War than what I might have found in any encyclopedia."
5,There is Hope for Halloween,"I am excited to give such a rich spiritual heritage to my children in a fun way as I obey Hebrews 13:7 ""remember your leaders and imitate their faith""! I learned so much from this book. Thank you Focus on the Family!"
4,Trevor's review of Beach House,This book has a good begining and an excellent ending.It's about a crazed sicopath which went into the past through a time portal in a old beach house.He picks out a group of 5 friends and starts killing them one by one.Then returns to the future.The acts of his past come back to haunt him at the end.Which may cost him his life.I would recommend this book to anyone that likes mistories.
3,"Helpful, but not perfect","This book does a decent job of managing the balance between techniques and content. However, its explanations of many math concepts are lacking. Though the practice tests are scored using an unrealistically difficult scale, they are still valuable when used in conjunction with the ETS PowerPrep software."
3,5wk Review,"I put 2 coats on my car 5 wks ago and so far it's still pretty slick. Although, I have noticed some water spots on my hood?"
4,wdcinvt,"I applied this wax to a one and a half year old 2010 Nissan Sentra and will admit that when I was done there was definately a huge improvement in the appearance of the car. People looked at the car and thought it was new. The only real drawback that I can see with this wax is that you can't get it on the black plastic trim and it does leave white residue (wax) in the crevices. This is to be expected with a paste wax . It applies easy and removed much easier than most waxes. The shine is slick , deep and appears to be hard. Time will tell how long it holds up to the elements. It is December here in VT and I hope it will hold until at least April when I can wax it again."
3,Over-hyped,"I bought this based on the reviews here. It's not as good as I was led to believe, certainly not as good as a quality yellow carnuba paste wax.It goes on Ok, with a small bit of effort. Letting it dry and then taking it off is the same, easy but with a slight bit of effort. My main disappointment was in the result. It has less shine than a good quality carnuba wax and additional coats don't improve the result. I don't intend to continue using it.Carnuba wax, on the other hand, goes on easy and smoothly, even on vinyl trim, doesn't have to dry (you wipe it off as soon as you put it on), buffs to a bright shine, and multiple coats only make it better.My advice: If you want a wax that goes on easily, comes off easily and lasts several months, use a good quality carnuba wax, one that doesn't dry to a haze. I recommend the yellow paste wax from AutoSport (I've used it myself) but I'm sure there are others."
5,Very Impressive CD,"I finally got a copy of Treason's ""Spinning"" CD... It is great! ...and if that isn't enough, the songs and the music are good enough that even if Ann Wilson(Heart) wasn't on the CD, I would have bought it anyway..."
5,Great book for Long Distance Cyclists,"Very good information all around for cyclists wanting to improve their long distance riding performance. Geared mainly for those desiring to improve their centuries, but not necessarily geared for the touring cyclist. Nevertheless good info."
1,Horrible Map,"I don't know much about creating maps, but I know that it should reflect real cities and towns, and it should reflect the actual distance between the those towns (using a scale, for example, 1:10). This map does not do any of that. The only thing that is correct on this map is the roads. The raods are actually there, thank God. I would give this map 0 stars if I could.I just wonder if the people who created this map tryed using it. I do not recommend using it."
5,The way of the Superior Man,This is amazing. I purchase this book in volumn and give it to friends... men and woman.
2,Ehh...,"This book is far too repetitive in each section. Basically, the author comes up with a good idea, presents it in the form of a chapter, then dilutes it with redundancy until you realize that you've just read the section's title in as many shapes and forms as possible.I'm moving on to other manly books... next up: 100 maxims of manhood, the modern gentleman, and the modern lover!"
2,Heavy on the touchy-feely; not very practical.,"Deida goes to a lot of trouble discussing man and his place in the universe in very ethereal prose, but comes up short in the ""traction"" department. There's not much here to walk away with and apply to your life. Comments like, ""continually shower (your partner) with boundless love"" when she is being impossible doesn't cut it, folks. This, it appears, is his answer to everything. Oh, and by the way, ejaculation is bad. Please."
2,The Way of the Superior Man,"This book came highly recommended to me from a number of credible people in my life. I looked forward to reading it based on these recommendations. However, what I discoveraged was an extreme look at relationships through the eyes of a post-modern spiritualist point of view. As a Christian, I found a lot of the book irrelivant ""spiritual"" fluff. There were a couple items for thought but overall, I thought it was a pretty sad attempt at understanding God's creation and replication of Himself through man and woman and the amazing intimate relationship that was intended between the two before the fall. I guess it's always good to know what humanity at large is subjected to."
5,This woman prefers superior men,"This book teaches men lessons not readily given in our society - how to be a MATURE man, and how to provide the contrast needed for a passionate relationship. I recommend this book to everyone, but especially the men who act like children in their marriage, the ones who don't step up and have lost respect from their wives. I realize mutual respect is a two-way street, but it might as well be the superior man who takes the reins and sets a new precedent. In most relationships, the female energy partner is like a burbling creek - they want their male energy partner to be a solid boulder. This book will get your yang up to speed so that your yin will stick around! Every time I give my copy away, I order a new one."
4,shockingly amazing,why hadn't anyone even suggested these concepts to me before? where have these ideas been my whole life? This is a must read
4,The Way of the Superior Man,It helps you to understand yourself and girls and why their minds are allways changing.
5,An important book for both men & women,"The content of this book really resonated with me. My girlfriend is reading it, and she thinks that women (as long as they are truly open to learning about what really goes through a masculine man's mind) should read it. If you're masculine, this book will likely resonate with you, and teach you about yourself and about how to better your relationship with your significant other (or just women in general). There were many moments in this book where I read a chapter and I realized that my thoughts and feelings were perfectly normal for a more masculine man, and that I didn't have to try and repress them. Very enlightening. The later chapters get a little hokey, but there is enough spellbinding content in the first 3/4 of the book to overrule that."
1,"Too ""Foo Foo""",This book had some interesting points but the overall theme was not for me. I felt that it was too sexual and feminine. I am glad that it works for others but did not help me.
3,Decent,"It's a decent book. The author had some valid points. She also had some points that I didn't agree with, but that's how it goes. It is a book worth reading."
4,Great for the price,"For the price, this is a good little scale. I liked that it was fairly small and the bowl was dishwasher safe. I find having to twist the base to tare the scale slightly annoying compared to other methods to complete that operation. The scale numbers are fairly easy to read but are small-medium font, so if you have low vision (like I do) a scale with a digital read-out may have more readable numbers."
4,Rotating ring big bonus,"Second time I've owned this scale. It has an adjustable ring at the base that allows you to reset zero with weight on the scale. I put a small plate on the scale, adjust to zero and then add the proper amount of food. You can do it once, or over and again until an entire plate is filled with accurate portions. And a Big Bonus..... since I've never used the bowl, I don't need to wash it every time I weigh something!"
4,Scale,"I found this scale quite easy to use. It is quite basic and simple. The numbers are small, so if you have a hard time reading this might not be for you."
2,Strenth of Tool,Its a useless tool we have the size tools in our garage that we could use. If you use it on somethingtough I think it will fall apart. I would have like to known the strenth of the tool. Will the rubbercovering with stand heavy duty turning.
4,"Do you really want your child to admire ""The Great Brain?""","Although the writer's style is easy to understand , and holds the audience's attention, the underlying message theme is one that says, ""If you can outwit others due to your mental prowess, then anything that you can get away with is okay [and others should admire you for it]."" Parents need to contemplatively examine the works that their children read, and ensure that the underlying values that the author conveys are the values that you want to impress your children with."
5,I have read all of the books and the adult stories to my son,"I teach children's Lit. and find these books wonderful. I am truly a Great Brian fan. These are the stories of a family growing up in southern Utah in the 1900's. The mother is Mormon, but the Father is not. The ""great brain"" is one of the sons, a very smart boy who gets into all kinds shenanigans trying to outsmart his friends. One parent review mentions the values in the stories may be suspect-but if you read all the stories, especially The Great Brain Reforms, it is clear that swindling people is not valued in the end. If you liked ""The Waltons"" TV series, you will like these books. I grew up a non-Mormon in Utah and just love how this family finds fault and good in many religious faiths-it is very honest. This is especially true in ""Papa Married a Mormon."" PLEASE SOMEONE REPRINT ALL OF THESE!"
4,Great boot for working people!,"I bought these boots looking for something comfortable and stylish for work. These are perfect! The natural color can really lend itself to most lighter clothes or cute with skirt! I find myself wearing them alot especially when I wear jeans! They are comfortable for being something from BCBGirls. I worried about sizing being a little smaller-but, for me the sizing was right on. These were a great purchase and they get a lot of wear without ever being a hassle!"
4,Polder 891-90 Triple Timer,"LOVE this item; haven't had the problems I've read here. Life-saver when you have to leave the room and have a turkey in the roaster, a pie in the oven and are simmering on the stove for a specified amount of minutes.Also have used the microwave 'timer' for things... but our new microwave beeps ONCE and if you aren't there to hear it, whatever you might be baking (etc) continues to bake. This timer doesn't shut off till YOU shut it off--hard to ignore!Once you notice which 'mode' you're in (by the flashing digit), program that, hit ""mode"" again, and you set the next, etc.Have given as gifts as well; no complaints (yet)."
1,Cheap and Small,"I didn't really like this timer. It was cheaply made and the controls were too small. I wouldn't say it was difficult to set, but the procedure involves an unnecessary number of steps (for instance, why can't I just set the timer and hit start? Why do I have to move that very small little slider switch back to ""lock"" before I can start to time something?)If you really need three timers at once, maybe this is the one for you. But unless you have specialized needs, you may want to steer clear of this timer. I mean, I just bought the thing and here I am back on Amazon shopping for another one."
1,Bellevue Cook,"This timer is a piece of junk. It is poorly made and unreliable. Within a few days of purchase it became clear that the internal wiring was not properly done. The timer would stop, the display would become unintelligble and the timer would stop functioning. I replaced the battery several times but it did not help. I plan on throwing it away and getting a different timer. I did like the ability to time more than one item at the same time, but if the timer doesn't work, the fact that it has some attractive features is irrelevent."
2,You can't hear it so it fails in its purpose.,"Lovely little timer, has all the bells and whistles you need. Only problem, they didn't make the beeper loud enough to hear it unless everything is absolutely silent and you are in the same room. Did these people even test it before they sold it? I'm getting my money back."
3,Not as nice as it looks,"I was a little disappointed with the the Triple Kitchen 20-Hour timer/clock/stopwatch. The information that I read before purchasing neglected to say that it is not free standing. It does have a fairly powerful magnet but it does not have a stand. Also, you can have either the clock or the timer or the stopwatch showing, but not 2 at a time. So, I can't see how many minutes the cookies have left to bake and also see the time of day simultaneously. Not horrible but not quite as convenient as I had hoped and am used to. Also, when the time is up, the beep sound is not very loud. If I am very far from the kitchen, I don't hear it. It works. But not quite as nice as I had hoped."
2,Not good - the timer is way too soft to hear from any distance,"It functions fine. But I expect to be able to clearly hear when the timer goes off, even if I'm in another room. You can barely hear this even in the same room if there's any noise at all."
4,"tiny glitches aside, what a boon to cooking!","Okay, it took me a couple of rounds to get used to programming it, but very quickly I got used to the system. Cooking multiple dishes at Thanksgiving was less stressful because of this timer. No running around setting multiple clocks or relying on my husband's watch (hmm . . .). The basic idea is that the long button on the right switches the unit from timer to timer to clock in a regular sequence. The ONLY thing you have to remember is to mash the big round button in the middle when each timer is finished, or when you're ready to program it again, to mash it so as to set the counter back to zero. It really is easy to use and SO HELPFUL to a cook who does multiple dishes on a regular basis."
1,"Useless, poorly made, almost inaudible","The magnet fell off the day I received it. The alarm sound is so low, it can barely be heard, even on a new battery.When you are cooking, it is important that you hear a timer so your meal is not ruined and you can avoid inconvenient things, like fires in the kitchen.This timer is worse than useless, it is dangerous."
2,Great timer - poor alarm,"The Polder 891-90 has quite a few usable components and capabilities. However, the alarm is very weak and cannot be heard unless you are standing within 15 feet or so even though the description states the alarm is quite loud. Would not have purchased this timer if I had known that the alarm was so weak."
3,older model better,The previous model work so much better. It does the job but the buttons are stiffer and not as easy to use
2,Timer Alarm Almost Inaudible,"One review I read said the alarm was quiet and would possibly not be heard in another room. I could almost not hear it when I was LOOKING AT the timer. Otherwise excellent, but useless as is."
5,Best Face Cleansing System EVER,"Why is it that whenever a company makes a truely wonderful product, they inevitably stop making it?! This product can no longer be found in stores. They probably thought it wasn't selling very well, but the truth is, it's an amazing product that even while using every day, will last over 6 months!I have very sensitive skin, also I like things that rinse off easily, and don't leave my skin feeling greasy in any way. I fell in love with this product in 2002 and it's all I've used ever since. I used to get horrible breakouts, and with this this product line (Pure Zone) that all came to an end. It's really really sad that companies stop making things once they're perfect. Wow, was I happy to see that someone still had it available, here on Amazon!"
5,The Dialtones and the Rainbows!,"This cd collection is worth it to hear the Dialtones, which consisted of the Safuto brothers, a cousin Eddie Scalla, and their lead, Rosalie Calindo. Bohemian Daddy is my favorite track, it makes me forget the Rainbows, sad to say, because this is a cool recording (despite its acetate, deteriated sound). The cd has a few rough sounding recordings... BUT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING! If you are a serious historian of oldies, buy it!"
4,Superior heat distribution--metal utensils OK,This pan is extremely heavy with a perfectly flat bottom even though the interior is curved. Not the best non-stick coating but durable with lifetime guarantee and will outlast most comparable cookware.
3,Sticky after several months,"Mostly I use it for stir frying. It worked like a charm in the beginning, but sticky now, after only several months of usage. I don't cook till high heat, and clean it thoroughly every time afterwards, but still. Disappointed based on the high price."
2,Mini stories....,"This wasn't a book that seemed to ""continue""...instead it was mini stories about the life of a Quaker family. A few funny parts."
2,Hurray for Rhubarb!,"Will someone PLEASE get this film released on some format?? I saw this film when it came out and still love it! I haven't seen it ontv now for years, and haven't been able to find it...I have read recent articles that cats are now the most numerous pets in the nation, in the several millions here alone. Surely the market forthe movie would generate serious bucks for the distributors if they will only release the movie. It tells a story not too far out by even todays standards, as since the cat inherits a baseball team predated at least one recent similar instance of a cat inheriting a fortune. It is a nice mixture of animal love and baseball, a good film to leave you feeling good too.We are all waiting for the film's release!! DO IT!"
2,????,"i guess that i didnt get it?????? a whole movie or short story with one line?? maybe british comedy lovers MIGHT like it or benny hill fans but i think that that is pushing it. maybe a british, benny hill, golfer or golf fan?"
1,The wrong Rhubarb,"When I ordered this video, I was expecting the baseball movie about a cat that inherits a baseball team, with Ray Milland.What I got was a British 36 minute comedy about a golf match,where the only words spoken in the whole film, is the word ""Rhubarb."" I am returning it."
4,"Great book, but programming section should be removed...","I picked up the latest Red Hat Unleashed book and almost had my arm fall off. This book should be considered a deadly weapon it is so heavy.I was looking for basically three things: 1) A book specific to Red Hat - I found it! 2) A book that would take me through the installation of Red Hat and get me going - I found it! 3) A book that would give me some good information and point me to other good information - I found it!The book, although it had a ton of information - had a ton of things that could have been left out. Specifically, I am referring to the programming chapters. I think a point could be made for perl or shell programming, but the rest are just there, as best I can tell, to take up space. I don't mean that in a harsh way, after all, it is nice to know how to compile C, but if I need anything more, I'll buy a C book. I think the authors realized this, which is why these chapters are so thin."
2,Less than expected.,"I am very new to Linux and being in such a condition I decided to try one of these ""Unleashed"" books. I am far from a novice to computers or computing. However, I found that this book unleashed absolutely nothing except cluunky old, esoteric instructions. I will say that being a technical person I expected a somewhat technically written manual. Rich in instructions... Step-by-step instructions. Lots of in depth specification and explaination. Not in this book! I found much better info on the Internet, Linux HowTo's, forums, etc. The author seems to take for granted that whoever picks up this book has been raised on ""The Linux Teet"". Beginners beware... Don't waste your time or $$$. Hint: try using Mandrake Linux. Made by Red Hat, very user friendly. Try The O'Reilly book ""Running Linux"". Linux Unleashed 6 has no redeeming qualities."
4,Very good book,This book is not for begginners. I would still suggest buying the linux os seperate from this book dont think you are saving money! you will end up not happy
3,An OK book...,"Not worth buying if you are a novice. Get some first hand UNIX/Linux experience before you buy it.Again, if you are an administrator dont buy it as there will rarely be a time when this book will find way from your shelf to your hands.Written in a ramshackled way and some typos too.Buy this book if you want to know about the flexibilities and features of Red Hat."
2,A book for advance users and thus leaves out details,"This book is for advanced users. So Beware. If it is going to be your first encounter with Linux consult another book. I had to consult another source for even installing the OS. You only get a general overview of a wide variety of topics. In a nutshell, one has to be more than familiar with a particular topic in order to benefit from this book.The secong CD in my opinion is useless."
2,Nobody is great all the time.,"I understand that many people highly regard this last album by the original Danzig lineup. It is clear to me that I am out of sync with the rest of Danzig fans when I say this album is the pits. In my opinion, this album is amazingly ordinary with very bland, dull songs that all seem like filler to me. All except ""Let It Be Captured"" but that's just not enough. I consider myself a HUGE fan of Glenn Danzig (I LOVE ALL the Danzig-era Misfits, all the Samhain and the first three solo albums) but I must suggest trying other albums, perhaps ALL other albums, prior to trying this one."
5,"Anyone would treasure this book, and be challenged","Surprisingly, this compelling story has a wide appeal. Even though it is fairly specific in describing a parent's struggles and a young adult's searching for the truth, the very unflinching intimacy of the writing is a sheer gift to any reader - young or old, parent or not-a-parent alike. Nothing was done lightly here; the heartache as well as the working out of people's faith and relationship had an overall astonishing quality to it. Just reading it made me want to love people better with a sincere heart that is committed to God first.I could see this being successful in a small group or reading circle setting. It would also be great discussion with a friend or family member. And here is my final endorsement: at my suggestion, my 16 year old son trotted upstairs to bed with this book in hand one night, and told me the next day that he couldn't put the book down and ended up reading to the end at 2 a.m.!"
2,Worst Veggie Tales I've seen,"This is one of their earlier efforts, and it's clear they were still finding their feet, so to speak. The music is excellent as always, but the writing just doesn't measure up. Both segments are preachy and not very funny, with awkward comedic timing and pat, contrived dialogue and situations. With the ""Gilligan's Island"" spoof they overreached themselved, as they just didn't have the computer power available to them to satisfactorily render some of the effects they were going for. Roman Catholic and Orthodox parents will probably object to the gratuitous shot at the sacrament of Confession that occupies the space between the two segments. It's almost worth seeing for the introduction of Pa Grape, but since his personality undergoes a complete transformation in later videos you don't lose much by not seeing him here. This one's very missable, which is too bad because it's trying to put across a lesson that's absolutely central to the Christian message."
1,Even good people can make bad videos,"My children and I are big fans of Veggie Tales but keep this one out of your collection. It just does not have the same fun, freshness and excitement that the other videos have. And there is no silly song! It could not even keep my son's attention and this is a boy who would watch Veggie Tales all day if we let him. Pass on this one."
5,No longer in the dark,"Last year my niece invited me to several of her high school volley ball games. Though I was an enthusiastic fan, I never really understood the strategy of the game. Finally I have a smart guide to help me participate as an knowledgeable as well as enthusiastic spectator. Plus, my enjoyment of the game has increased tremendously."
2,Maybe the price reflects more about quality,I ordered this for my son's room. The fan is pretty quiet but the ocillating button does not work.I decided to keep the fan as it is more hassle to go through the return process. Lets see how long the blower lasts. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,"Does what it should, worried about longevity","The title says it all, really. The scale is simple, but works as it should. I don't know how well it will survive in the long run, though. It's not made of the toughest materials and this appears to extend to the spring and needle. I worry chiefly about accuracy in the long run. I'd still recommend it to a friend."
4,"Fun Spanish Version of the classic ""Learning Bus""","I actually purchased this bus for my sister-in-law who teaches Spanish. The characters are fun and the electronic ""voice"" is very animated. Although I am not a Spanish speaker myself, my sister-in-law did notice that the bus sometimes speaks very quickly, which may be a bit difficult for a child trying to learn Spanish."
2,No Habla Espanol,"If you speak spanish, this toy will be a lot easier to work with. The instructions are all in spanish as is the toy's general website. So, to teach spanish to a child is a bit misleading if you can't translate what the characters are saying! On the other hand, my daughter seemed to like it for at least 3 days and I suppose just hearing ""different"" sounds has merit in and of itself."
5,"Polder 550 Oven Thermometer, Stainless Steel",The name Polder keeps appearing in my home! Why? Because they make a great and accurate product (s). Polder is my kind of brand...it does what it's supposed to do and it's not overpriced.
4,Excelent Maps,"This Atlas is very usefull to inderstand some (or all) facts about the first word war. The only thing to say is: It's all in blck and white. I like colors... But for this price is an excelent investment. I recomend!!!Sorry about my bad english, I'm from Brazil."
3,"It works, but the design could be better.",It works fine and I like the magnet on the back to adhere it to metal. I put it on the range hood over my stove. The problem is that it wiggles around when you try to press the buttons and has fallen off several times. I think it would be better it the clip on the back of it was removable so that it could be placed flat on the metal surface.
2,NO Progress In 20 years!,I've owned a product like this for ever...20-30 years...After all these years with all the new technology you would expect these people to put on a hi-intensity LED light to assist the viewing...instead you have the same horrible week flashlight bulb that is all but useless...in any well lite room...People it's 2010...put a light on this thing....It's not 1953...AGGH!!!
5,GREAT BUY!,The product is very well made. Love the granite counter top. I need more space to slice/dice and having this extra cart help w/ preparing the meals.
5,Perfect gift,Great gift. Just as nice as the very expensive version. Heavy enough and the right size for all my recipes. Even cooking and cleans up easily.
1,TAKE IT BACK!,The copy protection [stinks]. I listen to CDs on my computer and a DVD player. It won't work. We need to send a message to the recording industry that this isn't the answer!
5,very mature,"Well until this album came out I've liked Natalie only for her look and I couldn't stand her music which was overplayed from the radio to the TV. But when I heard (and saw:) the ""Wrong Impression"" I've been really suprised. I've downloaded the songs from the net and I'd fell in love with the album. I bought it right away and haven't take it out of the cd player ever since. Songs like ""Butterflies"" ""Wrong Impression"" or ""Everything Goes"" won't get out of your head for some time. The songs are great lyrically and musically. Natalie has matured and grown up since I last heard her. It's really worth buying. Really, really goooood pop/rock album"
2,I want to like her.....but.......zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"My head says I should like this cd, but my heart doesn't agree....quite frankly....this is pretty boring stuff....it's typcial Early 2000's fare....so-called ""serious"" lyrics with a folk rock slant.....I like the light and airy sound of ""Wrong Impression"" and I wish she'd have tried to not take herself so seriously......this cd doesn't have anything as annoying as ""Torn"", but it doesn't have anything that memorable.....I hope Ms. Imbruglia tries it again.....she has a lovely voice and somehow I think I'll give her another chance if she records again."
5,awesome.,"i've had this album for a while, actually, and am incredibly happy that it has finally seen its stateside release. The first time I heard it I was just blown away. The lyrics here are so deep and so haunting that it just carries the album along so well. Natalie's music is about real things and real problems and just life in general and it's all executed perfectly. I can't wait to hear what she has in store for us nex and I hope we don't have to wait another four years for that.Favorite tracks : Beauty on the fire, sattelite, butterflies, come september"
5,One Of The Most Meaningful CDs Ever..,"The lyrical work on this CD is outstanding.. Natalie obviously knows how it is being on the darker side of life at times, and myself occasionally becoming depressed.. I was really able to relate to all the songs and lyrics.Standouts are ""That Day"" & ""Come September"", which are very powerful in their delivery & give you a feeling that everything will one day day be alright.. while other songs such as ""Talk In Tongues"" & ""Goodbye"" can really set you off into a melancholy mood for days. Then songs like ""Wrong Impression"", ""Sunlight"", & ""Satellite"" are perfect for the radio & everyday listening.Every song is a gem and is one of my favorite albums of all time. People who can't appreciate it have obviously never been through a tough time in their life, thus not being able to relate to the songs' meanings.GET IT!!!"
1,screw copy protected,"If the CD is copy protected, I'm not buying it. I pay for my music, and if I want to transfer it to my iPod I have the right to do that. Screw the greedy record executives!!"
4,The thunder from down under,"Last year I bought White Lillies Island on Amazon"".com"" and I listened to it throughout my vacation to Europe. The CD comes to life with ""That Day"" and gets better from there! My particular favorite was ""Sattelite"". Natalie shows nothing but maturity and integrity through her music. I was impressed when I first heard ""Torn"" and ""Smoke"", this is Natalie's best work since her '98 debut. Hats off to you Nat!"
5,Love this movie!,"This is the third copy of this movie I've bought. First the full frame, then widescreen DVD, then Blu-Ray. Not necessarily Oscar material, but it's a great feel-good movie."

3,Last Holiday,LAST HOLIDAY is a great family movie. This movie is uplifting and shows how death is not something to sulk about
4,Knife Review,Ordered these knives for a Christmas gift for my daughter. The price was great and she loves the knives. She liked the white color and said that they are sharp and work well.
2,Should be called Dr. T's gnat repelling granules,"Really hoped that this product would repel the asian tiger mosquitos that are common in northern VA. It did nothing for the mosquitos, but it did seem to repel the gnats that are a frequent annoyance in the grass. I gave two stars as a decent gnat repeller, but it would get zero stars as a mosquito repeller."
1,Waste of money,"I live in Florida. This year's mosquitoes have been particularly bad. I purchased this product last week and it had little or no effect. However, everyone was right about the smell."
4,works well,"I used this product during a year we had a lot more mosquitos than usual and it did make a difference. I like the fact that it will not harm birds. I did put it on my mothers virginia creeper because it was inundated with white flies and it worked for that but put the plant into shock. Fourtunately, it came back the next spring though."
3,Better suited for children...,This book is very simple to read. It requires a fourth grade reading level. It was not what I expected as I thought it was a book that adults would enjoy reading too.
5,For Dog Lovers Everywhere,A Kid's Review:I think that anyone who loves dogs should read this book because it is just the best book I've ever read. I'm nine years old and I'm obsessed with dogs. A Dog's Life was so good I could hardly put it down.There were a lot of emotional ups and downs in the book. I think the writer gave very good details so you could see a really good picture in your mind.I was so inspired by this book that I have now written a book about the life of a horse!
4,A Great Retrospective!!,"Checkfield was one of my favorite New Age groups of the early 90's. However, I was disappointed that two of my favorite songs are not on this CD. ""And She Cries"" from the album ""A View From the Edge"" and ""Traveling"" from the ""Wind, Water & Stone"" album, thus the 4 star rating. It's still a great opportunity for those not familiar with the duo to get aquainted with them. Now, if they can only get their previous albums re-released!!"
4,Family,I received the movie the Cheetah Girls within a week in good condition. I'm very pleased with the movie and the service.
5,I Love This Movie!!!!,"There's nothing as good as the original...right?""The Cheetah Girls"" is one of Disney Channel's best movies, right along with ""High School Musical 2.""I enjoy watching and listening to the music from ""The Cheetah Girls,"" and Raven-Symone is just amazing in this movie!She is the reason why I started to watch, listen, and like, The Cheetah Girls."
4,A Fun Experience,"This is a very good movie it has songs that give you messges you should listen to and understand. Here is the basic storylineThe Cheetah Girls are four teens. Dorinda Thomas, Chanel Simmons, Aquanette Walker and Galleria Garibaldi. And they are out to achive thier dream to be a famous Pop sensaition. But when things start to go wrong the Cheetahs split up. Will the Cheetahs ever get back together.It is an exciting and sad movie great entertainment for the Whole Fanmily"
1,Awful!,This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Anyone who likes this movie is crazy! Take my advice don't buy this movie its not worth it.
1,No talent high school girls acting their age,"This was one of the worst group performances I have ever seen! Unbelievable that Disney has financed this ""Hack Act"". And the tread has only started with other weak talented groups coming out of Disney. Save your money for a better movie."
2,HATE It!!!!,"I can't believe I watched this movie twice!!! It was so bad, but I did think the singing was good. The ending was what really got me, it was soooooo stupid. I think this is a good movie for little kids. Thanks for reading!!!"
5,Fun for the whole family,We travel every Christmas and we always want some game that the whole family can play. This game has us laughing for so long. It is so wonderful it can slip in a pocket and be out ready to play at the airport or the ski lodge. Anywhere we are. My family is a family of 6 ranging in age from 14 to 50 and we all have fun with it
5,What an awesome game!,"If george orwell could only see me now. This game is awesome. My family and I play it on weekends, and it is totally hilarious. It requires little skill. You can all just sit back, relax, and toss the pigs across the table. Good for all ages. I really loved it."
5,Educational and addictive!,"This game is educational...depending on your education level. You have to do a lot of adding, which doesn't have to be, but usually is at a fast pace! You find yourself getting hooked on it if you're playing with the right people!!I would recommend it...have a blast!"
5,Fun family game; don't lose the pigs,"We have a blast with this game. I have a five yr old, and getting him to sit still and play a game is not easy. He loves this game. I also have a 1.5 yr old, and she likes the pigs. As is true with any toy with small parts, watch out for the little ones picking up and walking off with the pigs; they are small.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game."
4,"Great Game, Perhaps Slightly Overrated","I bought this based on the dozens of glowing reviews here on Amazon, the wide age range (easy enough for my 7 year old), and the low purchase price (less than $10).The pigs are adorable and the self containing hard plastic packaging is much more durable than the cardboard boxes most games come with. I am sure this will accompany us on trips to the beach.That said, the game gets very repetitive fast. And by fast, I mean in the first 30 minutes of total game play. There are a limited number of rolls and they take place again and again until someone reaches 100. And since you can roll as many times as you want (unless you roll a pig out), it is possible for only one player to play for a whole game with nobody else having a turn. Yay. We will have to look for some alternative rules to spice things up."
5,Great for Adults,"I learned this game 15 years ago in high school, and it was always one of my favorites. I have re-dicovered it as an adult and I love it!!!!!! We play with other couples and it is so funny that we all end up laughing and usually wake the kids up. Since they are up anyway, they can join in the fun because it is so easy to learn! I love this game and have just ordered 5 sets to play with my 3rd grade students as a math game. It is very versitile."
5,over 15 years of pigs,"I bought this game, or one very similar, over 15 years ago. Our children didn't seem to like it much, but our adult friends love it! It's great for when you have a few friends over for the evening and you're just sitting around, but be prepared to laugh alot! It's not for serious discussion, but rather when you just want to be silly. We love it!"
4,"Gorgeous pictures, and lovely ideas, but....","""I was really surprised that the author stresses the use of stearic (animal based additive) and completely omits the additive vybar, which is a viable and most preferable additive to many people. Her creative ideas are sound but some procedures do seem to be altogether forgotten. If it weren't for the pictures and some of the projects I would have rated this book a lot lower. Beginners should not start here as they may be confused later by some of the things that were completely missing, or they may not get the results they want due to a simple lack of knowledge that should have been included. But for the intermediate to advanced candlemaker, this book can offer some interesting new techniques, it should be in your library."""
2,are you a teacher?,"Titles do not lie. This is book is truely only for those who want BASIC and can teach themselves. If you`re like me and need things explained several times this book is good since you can reread it. But at the same time with very few examples, if you don`t understand it the first time, chances are you`re not going to understand it by rereading the same thing several times. Know your learning patterns before you buy this book!"
2,too tight,"Quality shaker, but fittings are too tight. With slippery hands, you will never get the top off."
5,Bite-size book perfect for littler kids!,"This little book is an exact reproduction of Chapter 2 in the original book, Winnie-the-Pooh by A.A. Milne, with illustrations by Shephard. All the charm of the original, in a perfect size for reading to littler kids, who can feel satisfied at having been read ""the whole story.""This little book is part of a series of 10 such Pooh books published by Dutton."
5,None,excellent. beauiful voices and clear enuniation. my granddaughters have had endless enjoyment when they climb into my bed in the morning. and i get to doze a little longer.
3,Book review,"I like the book, the one problem is the Kindle doesn't show pictures or the information on determining your body type in the correct format."
3,Less food choices,I have been trying to get back to my goal weight for some time. I came across this book in amazon and bought based on reviews.I found this book very helpful in identifying my body type. But the diet that is recommended for me includes lot of meat. I am mainly vegeterian and can accomodate chiken and eggs to the most. But I dont like eating chicken everyday either.I would have loved if the meat had some options. I just dont believe there is no vegeterian food that can replace the meat and fish options.So I am still searching a book with better food menu options. I would definitely recommend this book for people who don't have meat restrictions. I also wish some contact information of the author was made available to ask the author some questions. This would help the author accomodate all this in his future editions.
3,"Wonderful for some, disappointing for me","I bought this book due to raving reviews from several of my friends. I was very excited and optimistic. I determined my body type and was impressed that MOST of the bad foods for my type were foods that I already knew didn't agree with me. I followed the instructions and the meal plan, but met with absolutely minimal success. I couldn't figure it out at first, but then it dawned on me that years ago as a child I tested very intolerant to all dairy, and the diet called for at least two glasses of milk a day, and some recipes contained cheese. And since the book's instructions were to absolutely not omit any food from the meal plan, I decided to can it.I know for a fact that this diet has produced amazing results for some people. But if you have food allergies or sensitivities, make sure the meal plan doesn't include any of them, or you'll be disappointed (and not any thinner or healthier) as I am."
5,Superb Book! (Body Type Diet),"This book is fabulous! A must-read for anyone wanting to be slim, trim, & healthy. (Easy to understand)"
2,Mean spirited book by a Mean spirited man,"I buy every book relating in anyway to Columbine,so I picked this one up too. Mr.Porter ,in my opinion, does not act very Christian in his book. He spouts many mean things about Eric and Dylan in the book.There is not a trace of forgiveness in the book, which I thought was supposed to be one of the main doctrines of Christianity.I think dear Rachel would be upset at some of the things said in her name. The good thing about the book is it does give quite a few details about Rachel and her family.That is why I give it 2 stars."
3,Not what I was looking for,"Others may find this a five-star read. Its author is certainly intelligent and adventuresome. I've been researching the Italian Renaissance and wanted to know more about the work of a goldsmith. This account of the famous goldsmith's life is much more about his romantic affairs, his duels, his murders, his falling in and out of favor with popes and kings... It's a wild romp through the crazy, changing world of Italy in this tumultuous period of time, but it's not what I was looking for.For other readers, interested in the raucousness of that period, this may be a great read."
1,Misrepresented format,"The movie itself is wonderful, but the description says widescreen and it is not. It is letterboxed, as it specifes, but definitely NOT widescreen. I bought this as a gift for my husband as he likes the movie so much and he was incredibly disappointed and upset by the misrepresentation in its description."
1,"No Anamorphic, No buy. Get with the program FOX.","No Anamorphic, No buy. Get with the program FOX. I don't care if it's STAR WARS PM!"
5,MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND HAVE WATCHED IT OVER 20 TIMES. IF YOU HAVE A HOME THEATRE SETUP, DONT MISS THIS! ITS GOT EVERYTHING AND MORE. DO NOT MISS THIS!"
3,When Arnold met Jamie,"TRUE LIES hinges on stupidity rather than wit: Jamie Lee Curtis does not know what her husband does for a living and does not even recognize him when he is a few feet away. That moronic element of the picture drags down what could have otherwise been a pretty nifty action flick, although I would nonetheless see it again. Comic actor Tom Arnold upstages Arnold Schwarzenegger, no small feat. Director James Cameron definitely packages some excitement in TRUE LIES, but it left me feeling that Cameron and Schwarzenegger were resting on their TERMINATOR laurels."
3,Yes this is a Spy movie.....,"If the opening scene is not a dead give away (Things blowing up and suddenly he is being chased by bad guys on ski's) this is a spy movie although it dose go more into the ""Action"" of the film.This is your typical spy movie and your typical Arnold Scwarzenegger film, The rest of the cast makes this film fun (Tom Arnold and his typical humor).Over all this is a fun film but it is a typical movie in several ways this film is enjoyable to watch and it is fun but be warned it is typical."
4,We love this movie except for the foul language.,"Tom arnold is actually funny in this movie, but his foul mouth keeps this to a 4 star movie, and keeps it away from the kids. And I don't see why the foulness was necessary. Don't we include nudity and foul language when we have a bad script or bad director?"
5,"Yeah, I know, it's Arnold...","Like the title says, yeah, I know... but this movie is just awesome! James Cameron is a good screenplay writer and director for this film. I want this to come out in Blu Ray, but I'll have to settle for DVD now. I had this movie DVR'd for quite some time, but I kept watching it so much, my husband just told me to buy it! The scenes with Arnold and Tom are too funny and Bill Paxton just steals the show in his scenes! The women in this film are awesome as well! My only beef with this movie is the final scene, I wanted to say, couldn't they have been given better nicknames?! Doris and Boris?! Oh well, the movie is still good. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a little action and comic relief."
3,the DVD is not anamorphic as Amazon claims it to be,I'm disappointed that so far none of Fox's titles are anamorphic. Hopefully Alien Legacy Box will be like they said.
2,Widescreen Letterbox Format,"I fail to see the logic in creating a DVD like this. While it is in widescreen format, it is in standard 4:3 (1.33:1) rather than anamorphic (sized for 16:9 widescreen TVs).This was one of my favorite movies. The quality of the image on this DVD is passable. I hope they release it in anamorphic format sometime in the near future for people that own more-current television sets so we can fully enjoy the technology we spent our hard-earned dollars on.I was very pleased with the audio. While it wasn't up to Superbit standards, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars."
3,Arnold meets his match,"So this movie is great! I don't care if you are Arnold S. When Jaime Lee punches him in the face it is like...ok...this lady is pissed off...it is one of those movies that underscores that deep truth we all know. Even if you are a secret agent, and a world body builder...you are no match for your wife!!!"
3,ok movie,"This was an ok movie. It holds your attention. Gives you the highs and lows. Makes you care for the characters and the situations they are in. The most redeming part of the whole film was where they were trying to trick arnie's wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) by think that she was a spy and had her give her own husband a strip tease. The best! For all the right reasons. but it did lack some pizazz, and some middle of the road special effects. So overall it was something that would hold your attention and not be disappointed."
1,Avoid,"What I really did not like about this movie was how it showed people from the Middle East. People from the Middle East were depicted as terrorists who want to blow us up, so we have to kill them first, to protect ourselves. I wish one of the ""good guys"" in the movie could have been from the Middle East, so that people don't go away from this movie thinking that everyone in the Middle East is a terrorist."
2,Let's Not Tell a Lie: The Movie Stinks,"I cannot believe the fast majority of Amazon reviewers praised the film for its action and both ""Arnolds"" performances. That withstanding, this film has the most racist assemblage of stereotypical villains this side of ""Birth of a Nation."" It also exploits Jamie Lee Curtis's well-conditioned figure to titillate the 14-year-olds who probably made up the bulk of the audience.I almost gave it a 1-star rating but I couldn't do that to director James Cameron. He did make the superb ""Terminator"" films that feature kick-but performances from Linda Hamilton and a little flick about a doomed ocean liner."
4,FOX: WE ARE WAITING TO EXHALE,"WE are holding our breath too long for TRUE LIES to be released in blue ray. I know supply and demand dictates, in many cases, whether or not to invest in upgrading movies but in this case it's no contest and a no brainer. It has gotten to the point of ridiculous. In light of some of the older and less lucrative releases going to blu-ray i.e. The Marrying Man with Kim Basinger/Alec Baldwin, duh. It baffles me and many others why True Lies isn't among them. What has to be done to let the executive powers at FOX know that the public wants this movie in blue ray? This is one of my husband's favorite movies. I wanted to surprise him with it as a birthday gift in June 2011, then a Xmas Gift in December 2011, now as a Valentine's Day gift in Februaury 2012. Since that's not possible, hopefully, by this June 2012 I'll be successful. Hint, hint hint!!!!"
5,"Great CD, but buy the 2-CD ""Deluxe Edition"" instead.","CALLING ALL CARS FANS! What's left to say about The Cars' extraordinary 1978 debut? Nothing, it's still a great CD and it's still worthy of 5 stars. BUT - CHECK OUT ""THE CARS DELUXE EDITION."" It has the REMASTERED original songs on Disc 1 and they sound FANTASTIC! Disc 2 has the same songs in the same running order in their original DEMO form (except ""Good Times Roll"" which is live). As an added bonus, 5 unreleased Cars songs are also incuded in demo form. So if you like ""The Cars"" then spend a few extra $ and get the ""Deluxe Edition"" (see my review)."
1,"Yawn, what an OVERRATED joke!!!!!!!","Ric Ocasek is definately one of the most boring singers ever who sounds just like a four-year old child. All the albums by the Cars suck horribly. They were hugely one of the most overrated bands ever who are just lame, stupid, dumb, pathetic, lousy, awful, and horrendous. They are so trite, I can't stand them. ""Moving In Stereo"" has to be one of the most dumb songs I have ever heard in my whole life. I feel that this album is worse than the Back in Black, and Highway to Hell albums of AC/DC. Don't listen to the 5 star reviewers and avoid this boring album at all costs. Get On Every Street from Dire Straits insted."
2,Looks beautiful but breaks fast,"I got these chairs in july 2006 and was very pleased how they look. After eight months front right legs on both chairs cracked and broke.We are not overweight people (140-190lb). Very sad that we have to replace them, because we were happy with appearance."
5,Great introduction to Different Ethnic Crime Groups,A clearly written introduction to all of the various ethnic organized crime groups in the world and descriptions of the different types of crime they specialize in. This book also contains useful information about money laundering.
3,OK,"These bowls are ok, I am looking for more of a rounded 10 ounce berry bowl like my old french arcoroc bowls"
4,good but no cover,they work finefour stars because they dont have a cover and i have to cover them with foil when i need to keep them in a freezer of fridge.
5,This is so cool !,I just got it today but i love it. It's fun and you learn things you didn't know about the guyz. I think that every ultimite fan should get this.
1,this is a waste of money,Don't get this game there is realy no point to the game I gave it a star because I felt sorry for the bad game.
1,a waste of time...,"This guy knew Bukowski, it seems. Okay. The story is he was going to study law until he met Buk...and decided he wanted to write poetry.Well, guess what? This guy Richmond should have stuck with law and abulance chasing...because, as a writer, he doesn't have it.Nor do the other hacks: Cherkovski, Gerald Laughlin, et al.Read the Sounes book, if you feel a need to read ABOUT Bukowski...although, it may ultimately be a waste of time, because none of themcan touch what Bukowski created himself. Bottom line: just read Bukowski, and skip the pretenders. Also, SUNLIGHT HERE I AM is quite good. Contains just about every interview Bukowski ever gave."
1,"What on earth is an ""Original Edition""","This is not like Amazon at all. I've wasted ten minutes trying to figure this out. I echo the complaints of the others here - is this in Russian? The first translation? What does it mean? Why is it so expensive for a paperback? This book is in the public domain and I can get it for free on my Kindle. Something fishy seems to be going on here, or at least some sloppiness."
5,Anna karenina,Anna kareninaClassicSaw the movie love the book first book ihave read on tablet lots of fun will buy more
5,Anna Karenina,"Once I was able to figure out who was who in this book, I thoroughly enjoyed it.It is a very long read."
3,Long classic,"Sometimes a tedious book to read, the philosophical questions of that era became more important than the characters. My favorite part was the revelations of life and faith finally arrived at by Levin in the last few chapters of the book."
1,Poor Transmission into Kindle format,My Title says it all (as others have noted). I think from now on I will avoid free Kindle titles of classics. Seems pointless.
2,Save Your Money.,"You may think that the higher price of this Norilana edition of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina would be indicative of a higher quality. Don't bet on it. The text is full of typographical errors. After reading three pages, I gave up and intend to return this book."
3,Entertaining,It's a long story with lots of side quests that can sometimes be hard to follow. Very tragic love story.
2,this ebook version is difficult,This ebook with the pink and red cover doesn't have a table of contents. That makes it hard to navigate the book. Look for a better ebook.
4,Read this one quickly,This book just drew me in. I loved the story. Like it better than War & Peace. The movie doesn't do it justice.
3,"Not bad, but no ""War and Peace"" either.","I was very excited to read ""Anna Karenina"", especially after reading ""War and Peace"". Unfortunately, though, I was disappointed. Not a bad book by any stretch of the imagination; I just found it a little disappointing."
2,Anna Karenina,"I read it in college. The second read disappointed me,. Perhaps it was the translation, but I found it quite dated, and irrelevant. Now I have to reread War and Peace to see if the current review would be similar."
3,Anna Karenina,Good story line but some chapters seem endlessly filled with somewhat boring detail that has no or little impact on the story itself. If infinite detail is of interest then this is a good read but if cutting to the chase is prefered then find a shorter book or be prepared to skip whole chapters.
3,Modern Library Classics paperback is a good choice,"The Modern Library Classics trade paperback has better citations than most other paperbacks. It uses footnotes instead of endnotes. The footnotes translate all the French language. Most other versions don't. And the footnotes help (though not enough) with the Russian names variations that are invariably confusing for me and everyone else I know with no Russian language training.Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is a good yarn that anyone contemplating adultry should read first. The moral and story are similar to Flaubert's Madame Bovary, which is also a good yarn. But Anna Karenina has none of the political insight or compelling philosophy of history that you find in Tolstoy's War and Peace."
3,bleah,"I tried so hard to finish this beautifully written book. The lush description of Russian life (both priviledged & peasant) was amazing. I simply could not get past my intense dislike of the main characters. They were vapid, spoiled, shallow, jerks. Sorry Leo."
1,Anna Karenina,"No one will be able to review this title as Amazon did not give enough detail about it in order for someone to order and read it. It is most important to include the translator or publisher when advertizing a Tolstoy title. ""Original version by Tolstoy"" tells the purchaser nothing."
2,Bored with it,Only read a couple of chapters but found the writing style boring and unreadable. Maybe someone else's cup of tea but not mine
3,Can't seem to get enmeshed.,"I am trying to read some of the famous classics but not sure why this is a classic. I tried to plow through, but it just didn't grab me. Sorry Mr. Tolstoy ..."
5,This is a classic.,A little slow in the first chapters but it is well worth it. I loved this book. I read it in high school and I didn't quite grasp it then.
5,still reading,I am entranced with each character & can't wait to know what happens next. This is the first I have read Tolstoy....no wonder he is so acclaimed!
4,Possibly my favorite of the series,"When Dick and Dot arrive in the lake country they are expecting a pleasant visit with friends while learning how to sail their very own boat. But things never work out as planned, especially when Nancy has a hand in things -- first thing anyone knows she has Dick and Dot living in hiding from ""the Great Aunt"" and everybody else reluctantly in on the secret that must not be found out.This is a charming book telling of a simpler time, yet it manages to be adventurous and exciting, too. Perfect for all ages, even my 4 year old enjoys listening to these novels."
3,Good popular science review of human language,"There many good things about this book: it is readable by the non-expert, it is probably the best popular science introduction to language and it contains many valid arguments. However, the book is too verbose, contains too much detail and suffers from lack of pace. Pinker can be obstinate in his arguments which is not necessarily bad. My favorite: Pinker attacks the belief that ""people think using words"" only to conclude that sometimes people do think using words. The book also lacks a comprehensive discussion on quantitative approaches for language modeling. This was acceptable in 1995 but not today. It is high time to re-write this book!ps The definition of a Markov model and a finite state machine in the glossary will make many scientists frown."
2,Where's the Kool-Aid stored?,"I waded through a book on modern linguistic theory, scratched my head over the author's apparent misplaced certainty over what seemed awfully flimsy conjecture, and then started on Pinker's book. Is it just me, or has the entire linguistic profession drunk massive amounts of special Kool-Aid? Maybe Chomsky stirred up the first batch, but there's more.One example: after a few paragraphs exhaustively getting to the point about homophones and puns, Pinker says, ""if there can be two thoughts corresponding to one word, thoughts can't be words,"" and he seems satisfied that the case is closed. Huh? Who says words are supposed to behave like memory registers in a computer? Context adds meaning; ain't that the point? and by ""point"", ain't it obvious that I didn't mean a sharpened pencil? even if it's stored (as it is right now) in my brain?This book is very well written, which is why I gave it two stars. But it's fanciful and unscientific. Yes, I know he's at M.I.T. It happens."
1,B.F. Skinner,Verbal Behavior by B.F. Skinner is the only book on this subject that matters. To see us going backwards from science to superstition is pathetic. Steven Pinker is an embarrassment to science and understanding. If you want understanding read Verbal Behavior by B.F. Skinner. Don't read this psuedo-science.
3,"Well written, Informative - this book is not a light read.","Contrary to Pinkner's statement in his preface ""this book is meant for everyone"" this book is not a layman's read. Those who are linguist, lexicographers, grammarians and, the syntaxes word lovers will appreciate this work. At the core of Pinkner's' book is his defense of his thesis that language is biologically based. Well written, highly informative, book on the science of language. Conditionally recommended"
5,excellent,"well written and informative, needed it for school was glad it was on kindle too. Pinker knows his subject quite well"
3,For the total math wizard,"Well if it wasn't required for class, it is not a book I would go out of my way to purchase. However, the book shipped immediately, was $80 less than I could get at the school bookstore and was in new condition."
1,Pre-Calculus For the Calculus Student,"Swokowski's problems are many. The most prevelant I have encountered in using this book is the fact that he often leaves much up to the reader. Often he will give an example of some property and then leave it up to the reader to figure out how he obtained his solution. Other times he will give an abstract explanation of a solution, and leave it up to the reader to develop a practical method.This is simply unacceptable. While, for real science majors, it is of utmost importance to develop inductive reasoning it's rediculous to do so this overtly.I am an exceptional mathematical student, with a major focusing on mathematics, and I often have to spend hours deciphering Swokowski's explanations. Truly, this book is a great exercise for any lover of riddles, but I did not pay to be puzzled, I paid to be taught."
1,Post-modern Constipation,"Here is the book that will let you know Dogen as a Marxist, Post-modernist. That is, if you can chop through the flatulent, baroque, over-wrought pseudo-scholarly attempt at prose. Dogen, like Buddha and Jesus, seems to be a screen upon which our contemmporaries project all manner of their own ideologically determined thinking and pre-reflective values. This attempt at a text is a sterling example of such debased intellectual coinage."
1,Watch out! Product does NOT match the product description,The product description states that you will get a dozen(12) of those dishes.I paid $13.88 ( excl.shipping) but received only one(1)!
2,A waste of time...,"This book was drawn out, too many parts were repeated...all about the same thing. Started off good, quickly fell to the floor and then towards the end just confused me. I didn't like it, I wouldn't recommend it. I wanted to throw the book in the garbage after I read it and get my wasted time back. I'm an easy person to please, i love all types of stories, but this one just didn't do it for me. These women were acting like they were teenagers. Like how stupid can you be? The only characters that I really wanted to read about were Bernadine and Gloria. They seemed to be like the only adults there! Maybe 2 parts were amusing, but I can't give it more than 2 stars. I'm sure this was not this authors best."
5,good purchase,"Good tire for the price, no problems with mounting, very quiet running tire, great for on-road riding."
1,Gory and cinematically fragmented,"Not suspense as much as gore. There was no resolution, and the plot was non-existent. Must have saved a fortune in script writing."
5,So So Smooth - Best pen ever!,"These are my favorite pens by far. The ink runs smooth and the lines are clear and the feel is great. I have arthritis in my hands and appreciate a pen that writes great without a lot of force. Its true that roller ball pens run out of ink sooner than ballpoints that release less ink, but the smooth feel and darker writing makes it worthwhile for me. I've tried many types of roller balls when these weren't around, and I think the Vision Elite lasted longer then many because the tip does not dry up and prevent ink from flowing. Also, I have not had any problem with too much ink being released like some other pens. Its worth the extra effort to find this particular pen. The colors are great too!"
