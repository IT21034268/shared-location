2,Not worth the money,"The Radica Cube World Global Get A Way isn't nearly as much fun as I thought it would be. Basically, it isn't worth the money spent. We have all of the Cube World people and this item should have been an excellent add on. Unfortunately, there are only a few getaways, so it becomes boring very quickly. The little guys are way more interesting. Stick with them."
3,Indie,"This had a review in Amazon that raved about this movie. Well, I have seen it three times now and it is really hard to follow and slow to boot. I would not recommend it's purchase. If you want to rent it because others did love this Indie, be my guest."
1,yeech to the tenth,"Possibly the worst kid's movie I've ever seen. My wife opined that this ""was the worst movie in the history of the universe.""Well, maybe not, but strictly for girls under age 6."
4,A Real Gem!,"This book is a gem. It's positive without being sycophantic, intelligent without being dry, and educational without seeming didactic. Author Buffy Childerhose walks the fine line between maintaining an objective perspective and having obvious insider knowledge with the grace of a person truly confident in her craft. If you're looking for tabloid journalism, you won't find it here. If you're looking for an interesting story about one of the most important events in pop music history, I highly recommend From Lilith to Lilith Fair."
3,"it's a read, not enough pics","The story is well written and interesting, although the historial profiles were just stuck in , layout wise. But I really, really wish the photos were all in colour and bigger."
2,Dazed and Confused,"I am unsure if there is more than on e version of this book available but mine is seriously outdated! The author uses old versions of everything, I am on Windows XP and running UltraDev 4. These things make the book hard to follow and confusing. I actually became frustrated and I know a bit about UltraDev and am proficient in Dreamweaver.Also, the explanations, in my opinion, are almost non-existant! The author spends more time giving instructions than teaching- not the way a tutorial book should be.Maybe this book would be helpful if you really aren't looking to learn UltraDev and are looking to skate through a project, but for as a serious web developer this book falls way short."
1,I woke up this morning,to the sounds of ashlee on my alarm clock and now I have a brutal ear infection and need surgery
1,This album stinks!,"Ok look, I feel really sorry for Ashlee for all the stuff she's having to go through right now, but she has got to find a better career for her than singing. If you know a whole lot of people don't like your singing, that should give you a clue to quit. This album is terrible and some of the songs don't even make sense. I mean ""You make me wanna la la""? What the heck is that all about?! Look, I'm not trying to be mean about all of this. Maybe Ashlee could take up acting? I know she was on 7th Heaven. I just hope for all our sakes that she decides singing just isn't right for her."
3,"not terrible, but not fabulous either","I downloaded this album the other day and it was an okay album, but it doesn't have enough to make me want to stop listening to the latest Bad Religion album I got recently while I'm outside smoking my cigarettes."
1,This dumb bimbo can't even lip-synch right!!!,"If she makes a complete fool of herself on SNL, and can't even li-synch right, do you actually think she has any singing talent??? Puuuulllease!!! Avoid anything w/ this dumb b----'s name on it!"
3,An ecclectic music listener,"Give the girl a break... What artists first album isn't written by someone other than themselves? She's different from her sister and I'm pretty sure she wrote at least 3-4 songs that are on that cd. I bought the cd and happen to have pretty ecclectic tastes. My father happens to be a very talented musician so I know good music.This is not a bad cd at all, Theres a few tracks that could be improved and theres some really good ones, no cd is perfect. So if you want to buy it, buy it because you want it, don't listen to the critics. They only put their opinion in and yours is the one that matters. I'd give this cd a 7 out of 10."
1,1 Star is way too much for this cd!,"Ok so in the last half hour I've read through most of the reviews for this so called ""music"" cd. Not because I was going to buy it but because I wanted to see what people actually thought of this cd. I've seen her show and I've heard enough of the songs to know that I wouldn't ever buy this garbage. The thing that saddens me the most about this cd is that people actually believe that she's talented. She is not punk....she will never be punk. When I look at punk...I see NOFX and Bad Religion to name a few. This is the most pathetic thing MTV has ever done. I for one am boycotting this album along with any other MTV produced crapp. And my last point...I didn't believe that all of the 5 star posts are fake....until I checked them out. I am now a believer.....#1 my a$$."
2,painful,"Although there are a few edgy tracks, such as LaLa, most of this CD is glaringly obvious of Simpson's lack of talent and mediocre voice. Pieces of Me is catchy, but only because of the song itself, and Shadow falls flat coming from a well known tv actress and center of a reality show. The rest of the tracks try to transform Simpson's average voice into edgy rockerish, but instead end up quite painful and fake. Although I'm not a big fan of Avril, she succeeds at what Ashlee attempts and fails at. I'd recommend buying Avril's CD instead, or just buying the better of Simpson's singles. Basically, Ashlee tries to boost her own fame using her sister's fame in the music business, where obviously Ashlee does not belong."
5,Awesome AWESOME!!,"One sentence: She surprises me with this album. Im a big fan of Natalie Imbruglia and Lucy Woodward, and Ashlee does the right impression where the previous two artists have left. Most of the tracks (Better Off, Lala, Love Make the World Go Round, Giving It All Away) have such catchy chorus, and this girl can scream loud out of her lungs!! Although the lyrics is pretty childish, but for me, who care about the lyrics when her music is so good? Another thought: This album won't be as good if it is not John Shanks' production!!)"
1,WHY?!,"I can't believe this album went to number 1, above the Van Halen greatest hits set. Apparently people will buy anything these days. I have heard these songs, and let me say that this CD makes a nice drink coaster or frisbee. If you want some real music, go find something from the 80s."
1,oh bejusus how embarassing,hahahahaha thats what she gets for talking crap about other singers though i dont classify her as an artist this is a sign ashlee STOP SINGING!! and take your overexposed sister with you too!!!!!!
1,A Music Terrorist,"I have listened to this disc and I'm very sad. She should have never been allowed near a recording studio. She is a marketing tool, not a original artist.The whole reason she got that show was to sell more albums. My guess is that she will get plenty of air play on MTV. Artists don't need a reality show to sell music. Good music should sell itself. Ashlee Simpson will never realize that in her world. Stop hurting America Ashlee Simpson!"
4,Great Album,"Anyone who calls Ashlee Simpson's debut CD a bad knock-off of her sister's music is absolutely right--Ashlee's music is nowhere close to Jessica's. However, this is not a bad thing at all. Ashlee Simpson's CD is edgier and more rock inspired, with less of the gasping-for-breath effect that Jessica likes to utilize in her singing. The vocals, lyrica, and music are all strong. The song ""Shadow"" gives the listener real insight into Ashlee Simpson's personal life and, while some of the other songs are less memorable, none of the tracks fail to entertain the listener."
5,Let It Go,"As I am scrolling through the reviews, I find that some people are resentful of Ashlee's success. They keep commenting on how her succuss is only due to the fact her sister is Jessica. Well if I remember correctly isn't Janet Jackson the sister of Michael? Did she use him to gain success? You decide. Also, who has had the better career in the end, Michael or Janet? There are many famous siblings. Just because Jessica had success first, doesn't mean that Ashlee is using her. If Ashlee stunk, her album would have bombed, and her show wouldn't be doing as well. I am very impressed with the cd, and I would highly recommend it. Please don't listen to the haters that are writing smack on it. I would bet that 90 percent of them haven't even heard the album. This album allows you to see a new side of Ashlee we haven't seen on the show. It gives you a deeper look that last longer then 22 minutes on a Wedsnesday night."
3,not the best thing.,ashlee simpson has made two awesome songs. her album to be honestis horrible i listend to it and i hatted it. she did greaton mtv at the music awards thats what convinced me to buy her album!
4,Half and Half,"When I first bought this CD, I loved it, but then listening to it a couple of times I began to actually hear the words. Some of the phrases sound like a four year old wrote them, but then others sound so grown up. Although the lyrics themselves could have been better, I love belting along with Ashlee's awesome vocals."
2,Give me Jessica anytime...,"Okay, I'm not going to actually compare Jessica and Ashlee because we're talking talent vs. no talent. Like Avril, FeFe Dobson, Katy Rose, blah, blah, blah... Ashlee Simpson has made herself an overnight sensation by producing generic pop-rock that could be made by anyone who can hold a decent tune. The songs on this cd are light, crunchy, poppy, and BORING! Curse Avril for setting this painful trend!"
1,Her next album,Her next album........... Will Be Horrible!!! Some ppl say this is good but if this is 1 star then her next cd will be -1 stars.
1,R U kidding me,"Ashlee Simpimpson is just like her sister. Generic voice, generic looks, generic everything. Jessica has a show so now Ashlee has a show Jessica's a singer and now ashlee's a singer. Just because ashlee dyed her hair brown( dying your hair is generic) doesn't mean she's any different from her sister. She also sounds really bad."
5,A+ for Ashlee Simpson,"Even if you have never seen Ashlee's MTV show you probably know who she is either as Jessica Simpson's younger sister or Cecilia on 7th Heaven. Let me tell you, this girl can sing. I honestly listen to her album every day, it's my new favorite. I never grow tired of her music! Majority of her songs are upbeat and fun and great to sing along to! I definitely recommend it, it will be worth your while. Give it a chance!"
1,Autobiography of a fake,"After the whole SNL disaster, who would actually buy this? Who would pay for something that is as fraudulent and fake as this? Tone deaf, that's what she is. I would rather listen to Cannibal Corpse than this. *shudders* The sad thing is some people still buy her shirts and go to her concerts and listen to her ""music"" even after the fact that it was made clear that she is a complete fake. Rich Daddy's little girl. The record companies were forced to make this counterfeit in order to keep Jessica (who is also a talent less Britney Spears clone) or otherwise their father would break the contract. Look it up losers, its true. The only thing the CD is good for is for the rifle range. Otherwise avoid like the bubonic plague."
4,lovin' it,This CD is KEY for anyone! Most of the songs are upbeat and it's good to know that she wrote every song on the album. I reccomend it to everyone because she really does deliver a good selection of songs and she's also great in concert!
1,worthless,ashlee simpson is a talentless hack who can not sing. Do not waste your money on this studio-produced peice of forgetable garbage.
1,Crap,"I have always been a fan of Jessica Simpson, and her ditzy comments and upfront honesty, not to mention her amazing vocal abilities. When I saw Ashlee Simpson on one of the late night shows, I was embarassed for her. Why on earth would she attempt to follow in her sister's footsteps, when clearly she is nowhere near as talented? I say she should've stuck with acting, and stop the madness with these teen pop idols already! It's out of control..."
4,voice and melody,"It comes down to: do you like her voice/style and are there enough good melodies/songs on the CD? Skip all the superfluous info and let your ears decide. She's got a rockin raspy voice that lets you feel the emotion and there's, what, 4 hits on this thing. That's like Banarama, Monkeys and Milly Vanilly status! So it's all invented in the studio cuz her sister got her noticed; so what? It sounds good and that's the bottom line."
2,Rock? That was so funny I forgot to laugh!,"I like the songs, they're nice to listen to and i think she has a pretty nice voice on the cd. it's raspy just like mine. but if it's live i wanna rip my hair out, without all the enhancing done in the studio she's awful and i would rather eat dirt than listen to it. and she's definately not rock, that would require her to write her own lyrics AND music. she says she doesn't wanna be pop, well looks like that's what she is. another pop singer that can't sing live and couldn't write her own music if her life depended on it. maybe i'll use the cd as a coaster. hmmmm..."
4,FACE IT THE ALBUM IS PRETTY GOOD,COME ON NOW STOP HATTING ON THE GIRL YOU HEAR HER SING LIVE AND MESS UP AND TRY AGAIN ON AND OFF IN THE STUDIO ON HER HIT TV SHOW ITS HER VOICE GIT OVER SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE AND GIVE CREDIT WHEN IT IS DUE SHE'S GOOD GO GO BANDS IN D.C. ARE COVERING HER SONG BLACKS WHITES ASIANS THEY ALL ARE HIP TO ASHLEY SIMPSON AND LOVES HER MUSIC SO GIVE HER A BREAK
1,"The ""UGLY"" Simpson sister is a modern Milli Vanilli!!","Yet another gawd-awful bubblegum-pop, studio created piece of garbage. She lip-synchs on ""live"" TV, gets busted doing it and then blames her band! It's not their fault that Simpson cant sing fer crap. They just wanna play their guitars!Grade? F- When you cant even sing your own songs, that is really pathetic. Didnt Milli Vanilli have to return their Grammy for that?!"
1,"""No Publicity is Bad Publicity""","Granted this is the worst album I've ever heard. But all this press about how bad she is is probably just driving up album sales because of sheer morbid curiousity about how bad she really is. And in-turn putting more money in her and her weirdo dads pocket. Do yourself a favor, do not waste your $14.99 on this, Trust the 2.5 Million other people who bought the album and borrow it from a friend if you need a good laugh. But please do not give this sad, untalented girl anymore press."
4,Better than I expected,"First off, I heard Pieces of Me on the radio and had no idea who sang it, when I found out I was surprised. I don't really watch MTV, so that didn't influence me, the song did and the whole cd is really good. Alot of people think she made it because of her sister and that is probably true, but now that she's there, she'll hold her own!"
3,not bad,"I never buy CDs, but for some reason I coughed up 12 bucks and purchased this one. I was surprised...it's pretty good. Definitely not the most original or innovative album, but good nonetheless. She has a cool, scratchy voice--and while it may not be trained, it's certainly more interesting than many of her contemporaries' (i.e. her sisters', which is vanilla-bland). Some of the songs aren't great, but none of them are truly bad, in my opinion. Definitely a better debut than most manufactured pop singers her age make."
3,Ashlee..she's definently not Jessica!,"Ashlee Simpson turned me on into getting her CD when I heard ""Pieces of Me"" and ""LaLa"" which I love! I'm not really into the whole rock thing but I love Ashlee for some reason. The best tracks on the album by far are ""Pieces of Me"", ""Lala"", and ""Love for Me"". ""Love for Me"" is by far one of the greatest on the album. ""Lala"" is my favorite! Ashlee's CD is alright, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.Overall Grade : C-"
4,Not THAT bad....LOL,"Hey, I've got to give it to Ashlee coz when I heard she was making a CD I was like ""PLEASE!!!"" However, after listening to it a couple of times I've fallen in love with her style. It's different, not the best but all I ask for in a CD is at least 3 good songs and she delivers at least 6 good tunes. And I'm starting to find her raspy, low-whisper, off-key scream/singing sexy. Basically, I've been able to look pass her many flaws and focus on the music and emotions she pours into each song. I'm a HUGE Jessica Simpson fan, but I believe baby sis Ashlee's music is a lot more interesting and daring. Thanks!"
1,Lip synch,"If you enjoy lip synching ,Irish jigging POP singers on saturday night live you'll enjoy this."
4,A surprisingly good debut album for someone....,"A surprisingly good debut album for someone who barely knows the music bus. I know people pressured her to ride her sis's tail and make money off of it, and boy did it work! It's obvious that her MTV is just a longated commercial for her album. I mean, no one really knew who she was until the show came out. It's obviously just an add for her album. The show is just filled with her songs and her singing her songs.(I believe that the album was totally finished way before the show was made; it was just on hold so they could advertise it on her show) Yeah, at the end of each MTV show it keeps showing the preview of ""goin to MTV.com to listen to the album!"", and yes it aired it a lot...but, all this advertisement worked! I thought the album would be cheaply put together, but you can tell there was some time and thought put into it. She is more real than her sister,Jessica, and I think Ashlee will go pretty far in the business. Good luck, Ash!"
1,Which came first...,"... the german or the fake?Long story short... Ashlee's fake. I recently found a song that sounds exactly like 'Autobiography' by a german artsit. Unfortunately I don't speak german so the only similarity I can establish is between the sounds of the two songs. Anyway see for yourself... download ""Tränenschwer"" by Juli from the album 'Es Ist Juli'Again, I'm not drawing any conclusions as to which song came first. Just that there are two songs out there that sound exactly the same. One is by a german band who, unless Germany is as pop manufacturing as the US, has probably been around longer than a few months."
1,MTV + Jessica's sister = crappy music and lots of money,"I have heard this cd from a sister's friend and I have to say it is not very good. Unoriginal, bad lyrics, and even a bad voice. Why is this popular? Avril Lavigne is ten times better than this and I don't like her either. Jessica Simpson is hot with a good voice, and Ashlee is her kind of ugly her sister. That is the only reason she even made a record. ""You make me want to lala with you on the kitchen floor""? Come on, thats not very good songwriting. If you want to hear a woman with a good voice make really good music (with good lyrics) than check out PJ Harvey."
1,You call this music?!,"Too bad you can't give an album 0 stars, because that's ALL that Ashlee's Simpson's ""Autobiography"" deserves. She rides the coat tails of her sister's fame, makes a s****y album, and then makes a complete a** out of herself on SNL. This chick is a talentless, whiny fraud, whose music is juvenile and not even really her own. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this album. [...]"
4,What's With The Squeaking?,"Here is my opinion about this album:1.Autobiography (3/5)Good song, but did she really have to say dirty words? And also,I hate the squeaking after she sings the chorus a second time.2. Pieces Of Me (4/5)This song is pretty good.3. Shadow (2/5)Again! What's with the squeaking?4. LaLa (4.5/5)Really awesome song.5. Love Makes The World Go Round (5,000/5)Make that five million. That's the best song on the CD.6. Better Off (4,999/5)Second-best song on the CD.7. Love For Me (5/5)Third-best song on the album.8. Surrender (4 and 5 sixths/5)Fourth-best song on the album.9. Unreachable (?/5)I don't seem to remember this song.10. Nothing New (1/5)The filler of the album.11. Giving It All Away (?/5)Same as nine. If you skipped down, go back, you nut.12. Undiscovered (?/5)Same as nine and eleven."
1,"AHAHAHAHAHAHA...Wow, Words Fail Me","This is quity simply a travesty. She tries to pass herself off as a true vocalist, and utterly fails. I dont even have to mention the odvious SNL and Orange Bowl events to validate my point to anyone with half a brain. The AUDIBLE pitch correction and audio scrubbing is apparent on most of the albums tracks, and i find myself rather disgusted that any supposed ""professional"" musician could not have the basic integrity to make music with a profound statement, not the run of-the-mill teenie boppers you get today. I'd give this album a negative rating if it were possible, alas, it is not. Based on vocal techinique alone (she has nodes the size of tennis balls)a smart investor with a halfway decent sense of mucical taste would leave this ""abusemt of producer's time"" alone"
1,zero stars wasnt available,"i just saw ashlee on a halftime show during the national championship game. she got booed!!! who would boo ashlee! shes the best. this album rocks!!! i cant wait to see where her inner genius takes her next! you can tell her baptist preacher father had no problem with her listening to the sex pistols and dead kennedys as a child! the influences these artists have on her are undeniable!!! she even had a big anarchy symbol on her drum kit during the show!!! how cool is that! she even came out with an autobiography before she even had an album or tv show!!! ill never forget the first episode of her show when she walked into her studio and asked the producer ""what kinda music should i make?"" shes so cool this is album of the year 2004!"
5,Ashlee Simpson reaches her way to the top!,"Ashlee Simpsons cd consists of 12 songs all written by Ashlee herself.Track 3 is called ""Shadow"" and is about Ashlee being the shadow of her sister, Jessica,and wanting everyone to see who she is.She is not another pop singer and sounds nothing like the older Simpson sister.Pieces of Me is another great song written about Ashlees on and off boyfriend,Ryan Cabrera.Surrender is a song written about being over ex boyfriend,Josh.This whole cd is filled with great tracks and sure to be hits.I recommend this album for anyonec into this type of music."
4,An artist who actually cares about her music and sounds good,I'm not quite sure if the other people who wrote reveiws have actually listened to this album but I found it very good. Her vocals are something that I think are new and much better to listened to then most the artist producing albums now. I love this cd. You can tell that she cares about what she sings about and that means something to me.So if you like extrodanary vocals and a well tuned band I would purchase this Cd.
1,dont know why she made a cd a review from kevin f,ashlee is jessica simpson sister ashlee was acting but now she is singing in that is a mistake she cant sing for not thing
1,Sweet mercy make it stop,"Hey parents, want your kids to hate you? Buy them this CD and ruin their lives. I don't know who or what that reviewer below is, but I think he would have been more correct in saying ""I hate myself and choose to torture my soul with this terribly awful album, if you could call it that."" I have not heard this album and don't need to. Why am I reviewing it? Because it's 2 am and my soul aches with hatred for no-talent siblings of no-talent stars who somehow get record deals."
5,Ashlee Simpson,"Although she may have screwed up on SNL, and the Orange Bowl, and had acid reflux, and her band played the wrong song, that doesn't mean that the music on the cd is bad. Look at people like Lindsay Lohan she basically talks her way through her album, and lots of people like it. I mean just because she blows in person doesn't mean that the record is bad. Okay... okay."
1,HAHAAHA Biccch makes me laugh! haha,"This is a PERFECT example of what the musical popular culture has turned to for its next biggest thing: a sibling of another pop star, who cant sing, who cant play instruments, and on top of it all, has a SHOW about exactly that. The only way this shiza sells is people who think like this excerpt i found on another review for this CD:""There are alot of catchy songs on here, alot I can relate to.""Case. Point. Everything. It's not music ""we"" are looking for anymore, it's an outlet to dispell our frustration toward not being able to fit into the ideal lifestyle (i.e. rich, attractive, popular icon).I may be speaking beyond my concrete knowledge of everyone else, but the pattern I see manifesting itself from pop music has little to nothing to do with actually making quality albums.It is quite unfortunate, and it will only get worse. Thanks Ashlee, you've made the world just a little more plastic."
1,Contrived Garbage.,"Wow Ashlee and her fashion mullet are atrocious.Does anybody really like this trash?Pro-tools + Hot Topic Wardrobe = Not Good.Oh and how is this an ""Autobiography"" when it was written by the Matrix?"
1,Very calculated music?,"Give Ashlee Simpson some credit - she (or her management) knew that the only way to break out of the shadow of her older sister, Jessica, was to be her opposite. So, she dyed her blonde hair jet-black, based her music in rock, not dance-pop, and co-wrote every song on her 2004 debut, Autobiography (Jessica only co-wrote one on her debut, Sweet Kisses). It could be argued that this makeover for the star of the square WB TV series 7th Heaven is a bit too calculated, but regardless of the intent, the end result is very, very bad music. Stay clear of this one folks!"
1,Not even worth 1 star,"Even though she tries to tell us shes not like her sister her music screams ""I'm just my sister with a wanna be rock band behind me""! Even with Joel and Benji of Good Charlotte's help (which wasn't much) she still couldn't make it. Her efforts are wasted. Her sound is not unique or different. She sounds like everyone else. So why should anyone even waste their time on her? Please tell me b/c I don't know why!"
1,Oh good god,"This is the kind of uninteresting, uninventive and completely boring crap that is ruining modern music: There is no creativity, originalitly, or personality in this cd what so ever. This is for kids and (forgive my use of stereotypes) prepy highschoolers. I don't understand how this kind of stuff can become so popular. You want to listen to artists who can actually play instruments, are original, and know what they are doing? Try bands like Metallica, Aerosmith, Dave Matthews, Vast, or James Taylor. All of these bands put themselves into their music, know how to play, and can actually write. I wish bands like Ashlee Simpson would fade into an unpleasant memory and allow the true stars to come out and be seen for what they are. But, as long as this garbage is on the air waves, I will continue to bash it for the crap it is."
1,TERRIBLE!,"This cd was atrocious. Much of the sound on this album youve probably heard elsewhere. Lyrically the tone is very simple and shallow, very much what youd expect from a rich girl with a gift record deal. None of the tracks speak to the audience for which it is intended and may young young girls will have a problem relating to anything she is singing about. This album deserves 1 out of 5 stars and is an awful beginning to her musical career!"
1,Does she want us to feel sorry for her now?,"Now, I haven't actually listened to the CD, but I can tell you the only people buying this CD are pre-teen girls, and men over the age of 40.Children under 13: Go listen to Avril Lavigne or something, at least she sings.Grown men over 40: Real porn is cheaper and 99% of the time the women are more attractive than ""miss"" Simpson*cough*bornaman*cough*.I mean really, who does she think she is? Ashley is spelled with a Y! Hah!"
1,ashlee sucks,"the one reason that ashlee simpson is even famous is because her sister is amazingly hot and has a wicked good voice. Ashlee is an idiot and doesn't deserve to have a cd at all. I hate her and think that the people at the orange bowl were right. If you want to listen to a girl that can actually sing, I recommend Janis Joplin."
5,Great CD,The CD Autobiography by Ashlee Simpson is awesome. The Music is amazing! Everyone should go out and support her and her music! She is a young amazing writer. The CD is great!
5,Great CD!!!!,Ashlee Simpson's CD Autobiography is one of the best albums out there. She has a great voice and her lyrics are clever and real. She is definately not in the 'shadow' of her sister Jessica. Ashlee Rocks!
2,...Why does Nepotism Rule the Industry?,"Umm, let me first address the person who wrote ""just because you don't sound like Mariah doesn't mean you don't have a good voice."" I agree, but Ashlee Simpson CANNOT SING AT ALL. In EVERY SINGLE SONG on the CD, she is off-key for at LEAST half of the song. Her voice is way too nasal, and it sounds like she's screaming.If you've ever watched her show, you can see how she goes from sounding like crap in the studio, to average on her CD (which for her is quite a leap). Ahh the magic of the studio.I would give her credit for writing the songs, but they sound bad. What CAN this girl do well? Nothing. This CD is audio proof that you can do anything you want if you're related to a celebrity.Buy the CD if you want your ears assaulted. Otherwise, stay away."
5,Awesome,I love ashlee she is my idol she is so awesome and i love how she has her own spin and flavor on her music i love her sister to and i love how they are totally different jessica is beautiful but ashlee has that edge shes so cute and her cd is the best in my colection its not to hard core rock and its not all poppy its perfect you should totally buy this!!!!
3,A gift,Bought this as a gift. The person bought for enjoys this music. They requested this CD so I bought it for them.
1,Pamela's biscotti,"We didn't care for the bland taste of the ""guetten free"" product. Don't know if the ""gluetten free"" characteristics were the problem or that we were used to the more ""light"" taste of the Nanni products. Cost was NOT competetive with retail stores either."
5,A good toy to educate children,"About two years ago I saw Talking parrot in one my friends place in India. I wanted to have one,because I like birds. But I am againest keeping real birds in cage,It curtails its freedoman it is a crime. I must tell you that I was able to find the availability of talking parrot toyshere in shops near Arlington, but none worked. I was really disappointed. When I learnt that it is availableon line through Amazon, i was happy. But I was not sure wheather I will get a god toy, that is really working.The problem is, if it it does not work, I have to return through courier to get a new one.However I wanted to take a cahnce, so I ordered. When I received the order and opened the box, a beatiful toy was there. Yes it worked.I was estremely happy. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR A WONDERFUL TOY. I want to add some thing here. It will be a gift toour first grand child, we are expecting in a couple months."
4,Liked it but too expensive compared to others.,"The parrots was just as described, haven't given to grandkids yet to see how it holds up.. The problem is it was $5.00 cheaper from the manufacturer who makes the toys."
2,Pete the Repeat Parrot,"I must have gotten a defective parrot. Reviews for this product were great so I bought it as a birthday gift for my 4 year old daughter, who is obsessed with parrots. I've changed the batteries three times (The third I tried re-chargeable batteries that had just been re-charged.)and the bird only flaps it's wings, moves it's mouth, and makes a static sound. Even though the toy is defective She's so excited about it and doesn't want to have to wait for a new one.If I could do it over again, I'd open and try out the parrot before giving it as a gift so I could return it and get one that works properly."
3,grand daughter's gift,"product is ok for price point, but suffers in audio output.The voice recording output, repeats 2 times, in poor audio quality."
4,Wonderful,"This parrot was such a hit for my friend's 75th birthday, that I gave three people my place of purchase-(Amazon.com) so that they could purchase it for someone else! What a lot of fun for any age group!!!!!"
1,TOO FAST AND FRANTIC!,"My 2 1/2 year old didn't like this at all. It goes at top speed, one after the other. You can hardly understand any of the words and young ones can't possibily sing along at this speed. I was very disapointed as I love all the songs in the list and my daughter knows many of them too."
4,I'm Not Sure How Brandon Has Slipped Under The Radar,"People might know Brandon Butler for his role in the ""midwestern emo"" (hate the term ""emo"") band Boy's Life, but it seems no one knows about his solo career (or when he was at the helm of the superb band Canyon). His first solo album is an acoustic affair of laid back alt-country-ish tunes, and it really feels like the album you'd put on while you're sitting on the porch enjoying the sunset, and a cold beer.If I were to sum up what Brandon butler in a sentence? It's like if you found someone whose vocals sounded like Tom Petty and Bob Dylan and had them jam with Neil Young. It's that good. And if you like this album, I'd recommend...highly recommend his second album ""Lucky Thumbs"" which has an electrified full band version of ""Sparks""...and is easily one of the best of 2007."
4,Julia Child- The French Chef,"I was inspired by the movie Julie & Julia to find out more about Julia Child . As I'm an Australian she wasn't a household name so to find discover her cooking sessions was very exciting. Watching the cooking classes you realise her quirky voice and personality were perfectly portrayed by Meryl Streep!! Aside from all of that the DVD is a delight to watch. Julia makes things seem so simple. Watching her techniques has been very useful and I now have greater courage to try her recipes in ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" !!"
4,good soundtrack,"The movie didn't make it, but this soundtrack is very good. I totally don't agree with everyone who puts down the No More Lonely Nights reprise, Paul shows that he can take a song and change it to a totally different song, and one thats funky and soulful at that! This album contains my favorite version of The Long And Winding Road, it's just so soulful and smooth. A good soundtrack from the master songwriter of the millenium!!"
3,"A few shining moments,a few fillers.but not bad though...","not such a bad boy & no values are forgotten macca rockers worth listening too again. no more lonely night (reprise)is hands-down the worst mac song of the 80s(and why he still deemed it necessary to include that ... song on ""wingspan"", is byond me. anyway, the remakes for ""ballroom dancing"",""wanderlust"",and""so bad"" sound great as do some of the remade beatle tunes. great gilmour solo on the original""lonely nights"""
1,Not a WWE product,"First off this is NOT a WWE product and Amazon really should change the listing. With no product details some would think this is an official WWE DVD and it's not. It's another one of those ""backstage, real life"" looks at some of the wrestlers who use to be part of the WWE.In MOP it's really a biased look at thee WWE from those who are no longer ""in the fold"" if you will and quite bitter about it. Rent it if you wish but buying is seriously not worth it nothing of value here to warrant a 2nd viewing."
5,"Succinct, Fascinating Tales Courtesy of Thomas Bernhard","In Thomas Bernhard's most capable hands, the 104 stories that comprise ""The Voice Imitator"" are succinct, often mesmerizing, tales recounted from genuine newspaper headlines and articles. These tales are quite literally, prose haiku, miniature essays recounting foibles of artists, politicians, scientists, and others from all walks of life. They may also seem like brief outlines for some as yet unpublished great novel, but Bernhard has packed so much detail that readers will recognize these as stories, not as outlines of novels. While this is a book best suited for those most familiar with Bernhard's work, others willing to take a chance on such brief tales will be richly rewarded by the elegant prose often pregnant in detail, as rendered in a fine English translation."
5,Best facial mosterizer,"Being a man, I like something simple that works. The creme does not build up, is not greasy, and I only need to apply it once after I shower."
5,Used once and experienced a big improvement,"Nizoral A-D Shampoo - 4 ozMost of my dandruff and itching concerns seem to have come about after discontinuing long-term antibiotic therapy. The result has left me battling scalp issues for weeks. The product arrived on a day when I seemed to be experiencing a lot of itching and discomfort. I had been using Head and Shoulders and while that helped immediately after use, the benefits were very short-lived. After one use of Nizoral 1%, I noticed immediate improvement. I'm not saying my problems have been cured by a single use. In fact, I expect to have to use it again at least once to twice more in the very near term to keep the situation in check. However, I am very happy with the results."
4,Decent product,"Nizoral A-D Shampoo is supposed to help with excessive dandruff and it does the job for the most part. The best feature besides the medical benefit is it's smell and look. I think the shampoo smells great for a medicated shampoo and also has a nice blue color that is relaxing. There's nothing worse than a scary looking (tar), stinky shampoo! I would recommend this product for people with light to moderate dandruff. If you have heavy dandruff, try prescriptions."
4,Little pricey but good,"I have used this shampoo for two weeks and it seems to be working fine. It cleared out the scalp pretty well and hopefully in the coming weeks it will get even better. If it makes your scalp dry - it has not in my case - use it every other time you wash your hair. Some people do it every day and I definitely do not recommend doing that, with this shampoo or with something else.The shampoo scent itself is bearable. Its not as pleasing as the scent of shampoos like Pantene but for a medical product it is all fine. The only thing I did not like is the price, and of course, even the 7 oz. bottle is pretty small. The shampoo itself can make a lot of foam. Since the substance is less jelly-like than the regular products, be careful when using, it comes out of the bottle very easily."
5,Great Resource for Activity Directors and Music Therapists,"I am a Registered Drama Therapist and activities consultant in long term care. Recently, one of the old songbooks at the skilled nursing facility where I work turned up missing. I searched through Amazon.com to find a substitute songbook and America's All-Time Favorite Songs not only fit the bill but surpassed my expectations.It is wonderfully user-friendly for those who are looking for instant musical activity ideas, singalongs, and programs. The table of contents includes a listing of songs grouped into themes including Home for the Holidays, Hymns and Spirituals, Battle Songs and Sea Shanties, Patriotic Anthems, Way Down South, Novelties and Memories, rock and pop revival and much more. It is also great for piano and guitar and includes very simple piano arrangements and easy guitar chords. It virtually does almost all the work for you! [...]"
2,Limited view and at times inaccurate,"The book is easy to read and adequately illustrated with ink drawings. The author writes in a firearm technology timeline progression, noting what he feels are the signficant points in firearm development. The problem is the book is written from a British or limited European perspective and omits major contributions from companies like Browning, Winchester, Remington, Colt etc. John Moses Browning is noted in one short paragraph and is referred to as ""James"" Moses Browning and the inventor of the BAR, clearly in error. There is no mention of the 1903 Springfield or the trapdoor Springfield and Mauser is limited to one sentence. There are much better books for a similar amount of money that offer a much broader and more accurate representation."
2,Joni Mitchell?,On this recording Joni Mitchell sounds like she's singing in a bad piano bar. Never thought she'd be a lounge singer. I've listened to this CD only once because I want to remember her as the Joni Mitchell of the sixties and seventies.
1,Mitchell's Unnecessary Covers just for Her Own Fans' Delight,"It's a matter of idiom. Just like Carly Simon on her ""Torchy"" GAS album,this is clearly a well-known formula: an arrangement master as a guest, some GAS songs easily picked (not rare), and then - abracaddabra - a new hit CD which does not add anything to American song treasury. Skip it. In 2010, all you'll remember will be Lena Horne's ""Stormy Weather"", or Ella Fitzgerald's ""You're My Thrill"" or Billie Holiday's ""You've Changed"" - all originals from decades ago which you can buy NOW and HERE at one click on your mouse. Frankly, sorry."
2,Why?,"Why is it that all aging folkies and rockers seem to think an album of 'standards' is some kind of right of passage - a requirement of sorts before they pack it in. Rod Stewart, Willie Nelson, Joni Mitchell et al et al. Enough, kids, stick to what you do best, at least when efforts like this is the best you can do. I'm a Mitchell fan, but this one is bad news."
1,Couldn't be worse,"This thing is bad. Very strange, half-hearted, vocals that wander around melodies without really singing them. I don't know whether Joni Mitchell can't carry a tune, or can't be bothered. Take a good look at that cover; it's an appropriate image for what's inside. If you like music that is bored, cynical, world weary, washed out, and used up, this CD is for you. Otherwise, save your money."
1,The Worst,"I'm a big fan of Joni Mitchell,so I bought this DVD as soon as it was released.My biggest disapointment was that there is no video,just a still picture of one of her paintings with the music playing behind this still picture.You can save alot of money by just buying the audio cd,not the DVD."
2,mitchell meets mantovani,"Joni Mitchell has produced some devastating classics over the years. Her early work, bare with haunting melodies and beautiful lyrics. Later on flirting with pop and consumating love affairs with jazz and blues to produce masterpieces such as Hissing of the Summer Lawns, Hejira and Mingus.However, whilst sitting on her laurels she consumed one too many ""Case"".The best I can call this work is interesting and polished. However it adds nothing new and has been filed under ""use in case of insomnia""."
3,I was very disappointed,"I am a big fan of Joni's earlier work. I have original LPs of Ladies of the Canyon, Blue, Court & Spark and Hissing of Summer Lawns (and later bought the CDs) and I still love to listen to them.I didn't read this song list carefully enough. I thought she was re-recording her own songs ... but I think only two of these are hers. Her voice has become dreary and the tempo is very slow. It is pleasing enough on her own songs, but I don't enjoy her treatment of any of the other songs.I bought this last summer. I listened to it once on a quiet car trip and was very sorry that I had bought it. I doubt I'll ever listen to it again. I will stick to her classics, which are still among my favorites. I prefer to enjoy her in her prime."
1,Montovani on Acid,"This is really pretty horrible stuff. Joni tries to tackle some old standards and fails miserably. The backing is mostly overblown string arrangments that are brooding, pretentious and cloying. I don't know who would be interested in this recording. If you are a Joni fan, buy one of her old records. If you like old standards, buy the originals or albums of covers by stylists like LInda Ronstadt. More depressing than introspective."
2,Disappointment deluxe,I adore this inimitable woman. And what a thrill to hear she'd (also) done a compilation of jazz classics. But what happened with the recording levels? One has to strain to listen to Joni above the crashing orchestra. I'm almost sorry I bought this CD.
5,"standards, not covers","You don't have to like this, but let's at least get one thing straight: it doesn't include covers. Since federal law sets recording royalities for composers at an absurdly low rate (in deference to the record companies who buy the congressmen who ratify the legislation), professional songwriters usually negotiate an initial one-time fee in addition to royalty payments so as to survive. After a composition is published or commercially recorded anyone may legally record it again without the composer's consent, thus avoiding an initial one-time fee. A cover is a recording of a song made shortly after an original recording and released concurrently with it in order to compete directly with the original recording. Chubby Checker's recording of Hank Ballard's ""The Twist"", for example, is a cover. Joni Mitchell has NEVER covered."
4,One of the better Robert Goddard books,"Very enjoybale book, full of suspense, especially in the 2nd half. The story drags on for a little too long however, in the beginning (typical of this author?). I liked this book better than ""Into the blue"" and ""Out of the sun""; the story gets very sophisticated. A ""must read"" if you liked Robert Goddard books before.(...)"
2,A Dull Read,"Not only was this a dull story, but the ending was unsatisfying. I had hoped that the ending would at least justify the time spent reading this novel."
1,Defective unit received,The unit I got was defective as it had a hole where the handle is welded to the body. Also picture is misleading as there is 2 separate units on it but they are only selling you the one in the foreground.I Would not recommend this to a friend.
3,Slow and loud,"I bought this to replace a Xerox. This is much slower, much louder and doesn't print as well.It has lasted longer than the Xerox did so there is a plus, print costs are a little higher.This machine is ideal for a back room that is not occupied because it is loud. Not unhappy with the purchase, just would have gone a different direction if I knew how loud it was."
4,Southern Cooking from the Loveless Cafe,"Love the recipes and enjoyed my visits to Nashville because of the dishes served at this iconic eatery. After all these years of being in business to serve up meals for some of the most famous entertainers in Country Music, they haven't lost their charm or integrity. A fun place to enjoy a homecooked meal. One dissapointment, if your searching for the bisquit recipe, you won't find it here. It's still kept under lock and key .........."
4,Great Insight into West Point,Great insight for those who have wondered or never been in the military what the military schools are like. Very interesting personal stories and it gives a good look back into how Vietnam effected them and how their learned values helped them deal with it.
5,Surprisingly Relevant,"This book has surprising relevance to the present moment because it seems that every generation has to re-learn that words such as ""honor"" and ""glory"" are platitudes used by men in suits to get 20 year olds revved up to do their killing for them.This book follows a group of 1966 West Point graduates as they struggle through Viet Nam and beyond. This book chronicles a slice of life and a slice of history and is well worth the reading.Highly recommend this."
2,From an ordinary vet,"The author does a good job writing this book. If you are interested in the Vietnam era, it gives a West Point graduate's perspective. As an ordinary drafted vet, myself, I was left back then with the impression that most West Point officers who came through during Vietnam never seriously thought they would ever get caught in a real war when they went after getting that free education at West Point. Maybe that is why this book tends to be very negative and discouraging. It is discouraging enough to tend to make you feel sorry for the people in the book. It is so negative and discouraging that, if I work for the admissions dept at West Point, no way do I encourage applicants to read this book ----- in fact, just the opposite."
2,Bitter and Gloomy,"This book is a bitter and gloomy snapshot in time that unfairly presents West Point through the prism of the Vietnam War era. The Oct 26, 2003 review ""A Reviewer From That Era"", and the June 6, 2003 review ""From an Ordinary Vet"" are both right on the mark. This book ends up being quite off the mark. I don't wish to take anything away from Rick Atkinson who is a wonderful writer. But, judging officers, the military, and West Point by this book, and using this as a book to decide whether you are interested in attending West Point, is misleading and an unwise choice. If I were in Admissions at West Point, I certainly would not recommend this book. If I were teaching a course that is narrow in scope on the history of the Vietnam Era ... perhaps. It's way past time to put Vietnam aside."
5,Highest recommendation....,"This is narrative American history at its finest; Atkinson is a master of the form. The author selects a handful of cadets from the Class of 1966, follows the twists and turns of their paths from West Point to Vietnam, and their re-entry into American life. If you enjoy William Manchester; Edmund Morris; H.W. Brands; etc., you'll love this. I own hundreds of history books, and this is among my favorites."
5,"As a young man, one of the most influential books I've read.","As a Senior in high school, cautiously examining what I wanted to do with my life, the content in ""The Long Gray Line"" was a primary factor that influenced my decision to accept an appointment to West Point and serve my country. The story of the noble, real life soldiers is inspiring and reveals the true character and resilience of people who were in some of the toughest situations that my parents' generation faced. I gained an understanding of the social pressures faced by that generation, especially the soldier who also faced social pressures from the American military world of ideals. It is a must read book for any young man or woman who shows a concern for our country or military."
4,Gets better with each viewing,Bones is one of those series that gets better with each viewing. I didn't see the first season when it first came out so I watched it on Netflix. I watched this season on Netflix also. I hope to eventually buy each season. I like the whole romance between Hodges and Angela. The interaction with all the characters is so great. I liked the introduction of Brennan's brother and father. Each episode has it's own identity and can be viewed even if you have never watched the show before.
3,I love the show....but.....,"I am a huge fan of this show and own the first season. However I'm a bit disappointed with FOX on the release of this ""INCOMPLETE"" season 2. Don't be misled by the ""Complete Second Season"" title. The episode ""Player Under Pressure"" is not on the episode list for this dvd. This episode contained a key plot line that many of us were upset when we watched the following week's episode. I've contacted FOX about this and to this day have not received a response. Perhaps the episode will appear on the set as an easter egg??? I don't know. But, am I suppose to forget that this episode never aired?? For this reason alone I'm giving this dvd 3 stars. If it was truly complete, I would have given 5 stars"
5,Bones 2,"Bones - The Complete Second SeasonThe second season was as good as the first. There were some episodes that relate back to the first season and more to do with ""bones'"" father. For those that have enjoyed the first season, you should enjoy this as well. There are some great surprises in this season. Enjoy!!"
2,well.....,Emily Deschanel is good to look at. That's about the only possitive thing I can say about this show.
1,Not a complete season,"While I enjoy the show, it is not a complete season as it states on the cover. It only has 21 of the 22 episodes. While I understand why the episode was not shown on network TV, there was no reason what so ever to leave it out of a ""complete"" set. I have no doubt that Fox will some day release a new ""complete"" set with all 22 episodes simply to make more money. For now, I feel like Fox has ripped me off."
5,Bones-Season 2,"So we finally made it to season 2 after all the slow episodes of character development, we finally get the reward of really fascinating episodes. Other than the episodes getting better the only thing to really mention is that in this season each DVD is only one sided unlike the season one that I bought...which by the way I like it better as only one sided. I don't know why, maybe it is because they put the nice pictures on the front of each DVD. Either way Bones is a great show, and I recommend this set, it comes in one box, that has an open edge, but there is one DVD case for every 2 DVDs. Hope everyone enjoys their set as much as I do mine."
5,Bones the second season,"Thank you again Amazon, could not find this singly at the stores, has been packaged in sets. This is the only season needed, and of course, Amazon had it. It is a birthday present for my granddaughter and she is going to be more than pleased."
2,"My Dog Likes It, But I Don't....","My dog really likes this bone, but I don't because she tears off chunks and then swallows many of them. She then throws up on the carpet. I tried this chew because she doesn't like the Durable ones, but I worry about those chunks becoming lodged inside her, not to mention the throw up mess. I guess this product works for some dogs but not for others."
3,Interesting book,"The book was interesting and personal but it wandered around and was hard to follow. It was more of a narrative than anything else. It did not tell much of Tailholt, but told the stories of some of its people. The book was kind of hard to follow, and just meandered along with unrelated stories. I am glad that it brought attention to Tailholt, however, because I am a local girl and it is nice to hear about the history of the area."
5,Finally a new type of music,"If you are bored with all the artists that copy other ones until every song sounds the same you will love this group. I live in Canada and first found out about this Cd when I was in Switzerland, on the german music channel. I usually hate rap but Highlnad makes it sound good and is something new. I recomend it even if you dont like rap."
5,Good Value,"This set is unique with the metal serving pieces. Also, the sizes are good - none of the pieces are too small for cooking or serving a side dish. I used the entire set this past Thanksgiving and loved it! I love the option of using the plastic lids for instant storage."
3,Ice Man Review,Easy to read. Gets a little tiresome about 3/4 of the way through. Contributes to the Hollywood idea that all Italians are in the Mafia. I did find his life interesting and unbelievable. The author did a good job describing the ways of a psychotic.
1,"Lies, lies, lies...","Kuklinski's wild fabrications about all the men he murdered have already been debunked by other reviewers and at various sites on the web. The man was, clearly, a pathological liar. Even so, his lunatic ravings could have been a good read if Philip Carlo were a better writer. The book is repetitious and amateurishly written. The creepiest thing about it is Carlo's infatuation with Kuklinski. His fawning over the killer's height, strength, cat-like grace, and high cheekbones made me want to hurl.Pass this one up. There are many better true crime books available."
4,Impressed,"What a great read! I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I even found myself almost ""rooting"" for Richard at times throughout the story. I really enjoyed your writing style and the story just flowed. As the book was so thick I thought I'd try but expected to get bogged down and give up but like I said it just flowed.I am very curious to find out if Richard was actually murdered or if he was delusional at the end of his life. Was he poisoned? Is there any new information regarding his death?Thankyou again for a very enjoyable book."
4,The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer,"Confessions of a Mafia contract killer is a whirlwind story that keeps you enthrawled, and in a way makes you wish you could live the life of a ""made man."" Even though the author tends to repeat himself quite a bit with certain phrases throughout the book, the story of Richard Kuklinski is enough to keep you reading way past your bedtime."
5,the ice man confessions of a mafia hit man,"i found this book extremely interesting. i highly recommend it to those ""who always trust in the kindness of strangers."" it should also be required reading to parents and school teachers who practice ""spare the rod and spoil the child."" ""Catiline""....really! do you believe everything you read in the newspapers? maybe you are a cop or mafia to KNOW all the facts. i and many others found richard kuklinski much more real and interesting than hannibal lecter, or possibly even than you."
5,the ICE man,"I read this book last year, and enjoyed it so much, i gave my copy to a friend. After hearing him RAVE about the book, i decided to get it back from him and read it again. Unfortunately, he too, passed the book on, so i ended up ordering another from amazon. I hesitate to use the word RIVETING, but i must say, it certainly applies to this read. Even after having read it last year, i couldn't put it down, and was finished with it all too soon. A true story of a very evil man that will, at times, send chills through you, and MAY even alter the way you deal with other people. GOOD book."
2,Laughable,"I was really looking forward to this CD. I was so disappointed, that after two plays, it's been sitting in my CD wallet. There are a few good, faster tracks on the CD. Otherwise, I would have rated this a one. Billy Bob's trying way too hard to sound dark and brooding on the slow tracks, and it just doesn't work for him. I was literally rolling my eyes listening to track 1. Maybe he's been in Hollywood too long? I'll probably put the 2-3 tracks on to a compilation CD and find a place to ditch this thing."
1,"Oh, Billy Bob..","I hate to tell you but you have hit the wall on this one. I would allow that you are a talented writer and the instrumental arrangements are not an embarrassment. But please stick to writing screenplays and appearing in films. While you may be moved to express yourself in many ways and whatever you do may feed your art, your talents should not be squandered or diluted by engaging in an excessive variety of public endeavors. Not everything is meant for public consumption."
1,Stick to Acting,"I am not much of a country music listner, but what I have heard from this CD is terrible. Bill Bob has absolutley NO music talent whatsoever. Stick to making decent movies, and keeping your wife happy Billy."
3,What a Shame it wasn't EDited,"I love the premise of this book. I found it compelling enough to stay up all night reading it. BUT I found the interior and exterior dialogue ... unrealistic and tiring. Everything is here that needs to be here. And lots is here that could have been cut. That would have taken the hard work of editing out the repetitions, the wordiness, the paragraphs that could have been pruned to mere! sentences. Maybe when one is as famous as Rosellen Brown, there is a freedom? to NOT condense. To NOT keep the reader in mind. So, I come away feeling both moved and tired. Moved by the relation between mother and long-estranged daugher. Moved by the truth of both realities. Tired by the long-windedness of it all."
1,What is wrong with this thing?,"We bought this V-Tech Tablet Notebook for our son (age eight) for Xmas. The thing never turned on! Put in fresh batteries, read the manual, called VTech, nothing. Amazon gladly exchanged it for another. Now, this one turns on but the screen freezes after 30 seconds of play time and then we can't get it to turn on again for hours. Very frustrating. I can say, however, that our son thought it was cool for the two minutes he got to play with it. What's wrong with this thing and why have the other ""reviewers"" not had this problem?"
1,Pretty but Fragile,"When I got this necklace it was a little thinner than I thought it would be, but it was very lovely. The shine was brilliant and the clasp was so pretty. I gave it to my mom as a birthday present. The very FIRST time she tried to put it on the clasp snapped off so that it needs to be sautered back in place.***EDIT*** I contacted the seller and they fixed the necklace in a timely manner. Keeping fingers crossed that this one holds up."
1,made of flimsy cardboard,"the box sais ""extra thick dominoes"" I would hate to see regular thickness. These are thin peices of cardboard that you punch out. My kids can still play dominoes but the fun of standing them up and knocking them all down is so far from a possibility it isn't even funny. I thought this would be a good substitute for my little one. Her older sister has dominoes and my little one loves Dora. We may as well have cut up a box and glued paper pictures of dora on the and saved the 10 dollars."
5,Sad but needs better marketing in the States,"Why don't more people in the States appreciate Neneh Cherry? Given all the **** that sells, her stuff is accessible yet incredibly well produced. So why isn't it given a better shot over here? Everytime I play her music for a friend they ask me why they don't know about her. Why do I have to buy this on import (speaking rhetorically - I mean I know, it's all business)"
3,Quick turnaround,I got the CD very quickly but when it arrived the case was broken. The CD was fine and I am enjoying it. Assuming damage was done in shipment. But the packing could have been better.
4,What episode does Harvey learn that Sabrina is a witch?,I love the entire series but I do not remember when Harvey learns that Sabrina is a witch. I bought season 1 and it is not in it. I remember that there are all sorts of things that Harvey endured when Barbara Eden tries to make him suffer for knowing and Sabrina not being willing to marry her choice for her but when and how did he find out? Help me!
5,Very impressive!,"Love the decorating, cleaning, gardening & travel tips! I'll also be trying some of the recipes! I really enjoyed looking at the pictures of the different coastal areas. Can't wait for the next issue! Thanks for a great magazine at such an affordable price!!"
4,Love this magazine!,"Like this magazine for the decor ideas and great photos. They seem to focus more on East Coast living, rather than West Coast, but there are still many great items to read. I also like the listings of businesses to shop for decor."
3,TOO LONG A WAIT TILL IT STARTS,"I LOVE THE MAGAZINE AND WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PRICE, HOWEVER ONCE I CLICKED TO PURCHASE, THEY TOLD ME THAT MY SUBSCRIPTION WOULDN'T START FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. HOW DISAPPOINTING. I WANT IT NOW (DOESNT EVERYBODY?)"
5,This magazine is DEPRESSING lol,"Only cuz I wish I could live like this everyday...but I live 60 miles from the beach alas! Still when one can't make it to the coast, then Coastal Living brings the coast to you every month with all those wonderful pictures and articles. So many excellent ideas on home decor, cooking, travel. I've incorporated many of the decorating ideas into my own apartment so now I feel like I'm always at the beach...only I don't have to worry about tracking sand in the place! Coastal Living is such a well put together magazine...well worth the price."
1,ordered this in aug and as od oct 17 still have not recieved!,I have read this many times and order a year and still have not gotten one copy! It is now mis oct!!

3,Moe's Review,Dream Worrior was'nt what I was expecting however it was'nt a real bad movie. Just you have to be a real fan of this kind of end of the world stuff. I am so many movies like this I find fall short for many. In fact if it was'nt for the cast of good actors I would even be disapointed. I feel it was worth watching.
4,Fun for All Ages,This game is a lot of fun. Kids and adults can play it. It allows from 2 to 8 players. You get 60 seconds per game to answer the questions the machine puts out. It is amazing how tongue-tied one can get when the timer is ticking away. It is fun but does seem little pricey.
1,Not Happy,"I ordered this game as a Christmas gift for my daugter. Received it today, not happy. The carton had obviously been opened and taped back together. When I re-opened it to see if the toy worked, I could easily see why someone else sent it back. The Phillip's screw head to the battery compartment door was completely stripped. There is no way to open it and insert batteries. Amazon dropped the ball on this one. If the screws are made of metal that inferior, I question the life of the toy. 1 star for ""fun"" - never got to play with it and 1 star for durability!"
3,"Came broken, but had no problem returning it for money back","I can't really rate the product because it came broken. It wouldn't turn on at all. I was very disappointed because I thought my daughter would really like it. I had no problem returning it for money back, but I didn't have the option of getting a new one. Oh, well..."
2,BORING,It's so boring the kids haven't played with it once. I tried and it is definitely going in the garage sale box!
2,2nd Hand Toy?,"BUYER BEWARE...before you stick the money into it, maybe look at another option. I look at how the price has fluctuated on this item and it kinda makes me sick. When it arrived, boy I questioned whether or not it was used and repackaged. It looked ify, and then my daughter opened it tonight and it looks like it was used. Everytime you pass the game to the next player it sounds like BB's are rattling around in it (VERY annoying). The sound quality is pretty good, and it does require you to do some quick thinking which is good brain exercise. My son beat me at it twice, but I would have liked to have a much better quality product than a 2nd hand game for what I paid--almost $35. I was sold on this game because of the good reviews, but I am being honest here, so if you are considering it, perhaps put the money towards a new Wii game or something of that nature. Not happy and feel like I've flushed the money down the drain. If it were to be priced logically, it should go for about $14.99."
1,Buyer Beware,This product is the worst sony product ever because of the lousy software included (nero). it has never worked correctly even after downloading every patch and update available. Avoid this product at all costs.
1,disappointed,i have spent hours trying to get this to work.in advertising they dont tell all.like it will not read any of my sd cards.i have spent a fortune on dvds.no luck yet.i found all this out after buying and going to the support web site.no refund from the buyer because i opened it and tryed it out.please don't waste your money on this piece of .....
5,Eccentric & Swaggering,"No keyboards and no bass, but plenty of noise and great solos from three international jazz artists. Ray Anderson of Chicago plays trombone with a ribald sense of humor, serving up great blasts and bleats along with more carefully-prepared lines of pure melody. Irish guitarist Christy Doran is just as likely to hit the distortion pedal for nasty power chords as he is to gently coax notes from an acoustic guitar. And Dutch madman Han Bennink is Dutch madman Han Bennink. This is hard to find these days, but it's a wonderful trio outing that satisfies on many levels."
5,Love this gadget,I use this portable gadget all the time with my notebook computer. Most of my peripheral accessories are compatible. It is convenient and functions well.
5,Do not understand all of the complaining!,"I have most all of Pavarotti,Carreras,Domingo and Bocelli.Love them all and Ti Adoro is my favorite of Pavarotti's works."
2,Less could be better!,"What seems to characterize Pavarotti's performance on this recording is, never sing anything loud that you can sing louder!I felt as though Luciano was trying to convince us that he still has ""it."" Having said this, I do like the recording. Who is better? He has that unique sound that distinguishes him from all others. I was impressed by the timber of his lower register. It is also the closest to moderation of volume that he comes to on this recording."
5,A Masterpiece!!!,"From the first sentence of 'Carrie's Story', I was hooked. I read the entire book in a couple of hours. I just could not put it down! I was a bit skeptical about the 'pony play' section the book, but this was not a large part of the story, and it was written in a very classy and interesting way. It was not as steamy as I thought it may be, but it was so compelling. As soon as I shut the book, I came onto Amazon to order the sequal. I cannot wait to read it!!! I highly recommend this book!!"
3,"Some Cool, Some ""Interesting"" music","""Baby it's cold outside"" by Dean Martin is very cool and not one you hear on the radio every year. A couple of the other ones though are way out there. One should be titled ""Christmas at the roller rink"" because it is classic organ music. Another is even more odd with Chrismas carols set to the old standard ""Tequela"" Bottom line is don't expect the usual Christmas fare and you may enjoy this CD.Mark"
5,Best Psoriasis medicated shampoo,I have used many different shampoos to handle a few spots of psoriasis on my head but I always come back to Neutrogena coal tar (T-Gel) shampoo.
3,Ok product!,I used this in conjunction with castor oil from Jamaica so Im not quite sure which worked! The second time around I used the shampoo only later that night I noticed the flakes on my scalp not sure if that should be the reaction before the dry scalp goes away. My scalp get excessively dry in the winter and I hate to see the flakes so I think together with the castor oil Ill continue to use/buy this product
5,HAWAII FIVE-O SEASONS 1 THUR 3,SEASON 1 THUR 3 ARE GREAT.WATCH DANNY THE MONOPLOY THEIF STRIKE AGAIN HE WANTS SEASON 5.HE PLANS TO GET THEM ALL THE SHOW IS GREAT AND SO IS HAWAAII FIVE-O.GET HIM DANNY.
3,Not Top-Notch Jack,"As far as animated series are concerned, as a whole, Samurai Jack Season 2 is very entertaining. However, it simply doesn't match up to Season 1.The main things I loved about Season 1 -- and thought made this series so unique -- were absent from Season 2. I loved the gradual pace, how it was not as chatty as other cartoons and each episode was like its own novel.Season 2, while action-packed and still visually appealing, just doesn't draw me in and is not as mature as the first season. I almost felt like the writers were scrapped for ideas. Most of all, the funny, wicked villain Aku was thoroughly under-used."
4,Love this,This is funny; the old fashioned clean fun I remember from years ago. There is a kind of innocent charm that I love about it that often has a message about life hidden in the humor. It's worth having on your shelf.
4,Very Generic,"I think someone has the job of re-packaging these into smaller boxes. Not what I expected from Amazon, but happy they are as these are a fraction of the cost I'd pay at a local lumberyard. Thanks"
4,A good time,"I think this is worth picking up. It's a fun game, not something that's going to keep you on the edge of your seat. It starts off a little slow, and my roommate asked me a few times why it was so easy. But once you get some money and some faster cars (and a few houses to hold all your cars) it does pick up and the races get a little more challenging. I finished NFS Most Wanted and Carbon...both of those games had places I was sweating and just wishing I could get through this or that section. There is none of that ""pressure"" with this game. If you're a die hard racing game fan you may not enjoy this as much as someone who just wants to sit down a have a good time."
2,One of Cage's least accessible recordings yet.,"As much as I may like to, it's impossible for me to give this recording a favorable review. John Cage is not a bad composer, in fact, he's written quite a few marvelous pieces, like his ""Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano."" This is cutting-edge music that is taking risks with every note, and yet it is fantastically listenable.Unfortunately, ""Litany for the Whale"" doesn't share these characteristics. It is cutting-edge, certainly, and it takes a great deal of risks. But it isn't listenable. At times it's practically painful to listen to it, simply because it is so strange. Cage's twisted nihilistic philosophy is all to evident here. There is no real attempt to make it musical or listenable, and many attempts are made to make it unusual.John Cage has written good music. This is not some of it."
2,not the best,"the case did fit the player very well and did excellent in protecting it, but...1. you have to remove the player to charge because the charger isnt that small, leaving scratch marks on the zen2. it is kinda bulky, cant fit in any pockets3. must remove the zen if you want to use the microphone featurei just bought the silicone case with screen protectors, works just as good, doesnt leave scratch marks, much much smaller"
1,beware,"this case just stained my brand new zen and to add more injury to it, you would have a hard time controling your zen for some reason once you put this case on."
2,Disappointing,"It's a shame that Amazon.com doesn't have the ""look inside"" feature for this book, because it doesn't just ""[include] tips on writing resumes, filling out applications, interviewing, and keeping a job,"" over ONE HUNDRED PAGES are devoted to this! And it's not even horse-industry-specific information, it's the same stuff you could find in any job-seeking guidebook. There are 71 horse-related careers that get a single-page outline each. Might be useful for someone who has absolutely no knowledge of the horse industry, or someone looking for a general job-hunting guide with a little horsey info at the end, but that's about it."
3,Disappointing,"It's too bad amazon doesn't have the ""look inside"" option for this book. It doesn't just ""[include] tips on writing resumes, filling out applications, interviewing, and keeping a job,"" over ONE HUNDRED PAGES are devoted to this. And it's all very generic info that you could find in any ""how to get and keep a job"" book. Then there are 70 pages outlining 71 careers - that's right, ONE PAGE devoted to each. Could be useful if you really have no idea what's involved in working with horses, but otherwise not worth the $."
1,"The codes are missing, just xx is written","Needed some codes for Midi meta-events and bought the book to get the codes.But instead of the important new midi codes there are just ""xx"".Completely useless. This is not a book about midi, but a collection of low quality articlesMogens"
3,Batteries,"Sony makes a good product generally however there are no instructions on how long you need to charges these dead batteries upon arrival.I seached all over the package and there was no guidance. So, there is no way of knowing whether these will work at their optimum levels."
4,This Works - Yea,"I purchased this item after reading other reviews and I am happy I did. I had tried several other carafes which claimed to keep coffee hot but did not deliver - this one really works. It keeps coffee hot for several hours and as a added bonus it is easy to pour. The push button feature makes this product easy to use for everyone. In fact, I like this so much I plan to order another one for my summer cabin. Worth it's price!"
2,Sticky button,"This carafe keeps beverages warm enough. The problem I'm having is the push button on the lid sticking in the open position. The instructions that accompanied the carafe address this issue, although they were written for a different model that has the push button on the top of the lid. Despite following these instructions the push button still sticks. To get the lid to close now after I'm done pouring I have to release the button and smack the top of the carafe. Very poor design in my opinion. I wouldn't buy another Zojirushi product based on this experience."
2,Too slick by half,"This carafe works okay to keep coffee hot and it looks nice enough. But there is a flaw in the lid. Functionally, it's effective -- just press a button to open the pour spout -- no unscrewing of the top needed. But to make this work, coffee has to flow through a plastic channel in the lid and cleaning that channel out is damn near impossible. You have to insert a long object (the end of a spoon or a pen) into the actuator on the lid, while holding the thing under running water; then, do the same thing while trying to shake the water out. If you don't do that, you'll find liquid remaining in the lid, long after you've used it (shake it and you'll hear the liquid move around)."
3,Don't sell your microwave,"My old Thermos brand carafe had about seen it's day, so after reading all of the great reviews here I picked one up one of these Zojirushi's. I have to say it barely keeps a fresh, piping hot pot of coffee warm until lunch time. In fact, I think my old Thermos brand plastic carafe actually did a little better job. Sorry, I just don't see all the excitement over this item. I find it an average performer. This is the model made in Japan and I have to say I'm not excited about the quality of construction either. Now I wish I would have just spent a little extra money on an airpot."
1,BAD!!!,The movie is not the same as the book. They change the ending. that was the worst. They also have the dog Jessie narrate it and she doesn't in the book. TERRIBLE!!!!!!
3,NICE YELLING AND SCREAMING C.D (NICE),"I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME SO I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS SHORT!THIS C.D WAS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. IT HAD GOOD SONGS AND EVERYTHING BUT YOU COULDN'T HERE A LOT OF WHAT THEY WERE SAYING. IF YOU JUST LIKE THE BEAT OF ALBUMS AND SUCH GET THIS, OR MABE THIS REVIEW PEAKED YOUR INTEREST (NNNOTTTT!)"
1,Product showed up expired,"The mask has a stale smell to it and no fragrance at all. I have used this product before and really lke it, but I believe what I received was an out of date product."
4,Beginner Swinging A-Z,A must read for all those swinger questions you wanted know but just didn't know who to ask. Very easily written and very easily read.
4,Older Skool Dance Music Extravaganza,"If you're down with the history of popular dance music, this is a pretty seminal collection of some of the oddities and classics that made their way into deejay record crates back in the day; it's almost worth the price alone to hear Liquid Liquid's ""Cavern"" again - the bassline launched a million feet at Danceteria and the Peppermint Lounge (this is post-Studio 54 and pre-Area, kids), and spawned imitators aplenty. And who would've imagined that Steve Miller would've set bodies movin'?! Put this one on at your next party and freak some heads with your all-knowing koolness!"
3,Old geometry SOL review book,"This book is good as far as it goes - which is to abour 2005. The state of Virginia has added material on the properties of circles, chords, secants and tangets to the SOL test since then. The current SOL test is no long strictly multiple choice, as was the case in 2005. Dispite all this, this book is useful as a self paced instructional guide. It gets across what is needed to pass the test in a concise format."
5,Exactly the same as the one in campus bookstore,Very satisfied with the quality of the product. The book is cheaper than the one sold in campus bookstore. I received it in brand new condition.
4,Nice!,"These are nice round cutters, although a bit smaller than what I expected. They're decently made, although they are not going to last through the ages. But for the price they're good for basics."
3,Worked out it was suppose to,I thought these worked a they should. Again alittle cheaply made but it what u pay for. If u were going to use it alot i may invest in a better quality
5,Definitely a great book! :),I loved how Hal went thru and verified thru mostly the Scripture and past literatures to Bible times to see what God has to say about when the rapture takes place. So much pretrib evidence that it's amazing. I keep finding the same thing after i prayed God show me also. What a blessing this book was to read so muchmore verification of the grace pretrib rapture. :) God bless.
2,Don't be fooled! It is a reprint.,This is a reprint of the 1951 edition of this manual. A newer edition exists! Don't be fooled into thinking that this is the newer edition (Citation: Soil Survey Division Staff. 1993. Soil survey manual. Soil Conservation Service. U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbook 18. [out of print]). Thought I'd trully scored on this being a reprint of the 1993 edition and it is NOT. Nevertheless it is valuable and I am glad to have it.
1,Three tracks from other singles,"The tracks on this CD were already released on 2 other singles. Tracks 1 & 3 are fromMayday 2000 / Batucada 2000, even though track 1 is labeled ""Batucada 2000 (Killer Horns Remix)"". (I bought this single thinking this was a different mix.) Track 2 is fromBatucada [Single-CD]. If you have have any of these tracks don't buy this."
1,"""I don't like pits in my juice""....and I don't like most the show either.","Thanks to the many reviewers who informed me how this show is butchered. I guess I will be saving my $$$. Miami Vice has all of the musics, so what is the problem here? I wished I could give this a negative star, as a result."
1,No more butchered episodes for me.,"There is a disclaimer on the box that warns that these episodes are edited; however, I was hoping they would be minimal as in the previous two releases. They are not minimal and many episodes are unwatchable for knowledgeable fans. I'm not in agreement with those who say that edited versions are better than nothing. Because of the disclaimer, I cannot return this item, as I would like; however, this is the last season of this show that I'll buy. What a shame for Paramount to show such contempt for its customers."
1,I hate censorship.,There's absolutely no excuse to excise scenes or music on any TV show or movie DVD. We fans are willing to pay an extra 10 or 20 dollars to get the original music.
4,"Different, but really good","Face to Face is always full of suprises. You never know what they will do next. I think it was good that they came out with this album, because it gives fans a new taste of what Face to Face is capable of doing. This album will also bring in new fans. Personally I think that the song ""The sunny side of the street"" is their best song on this album. I also think they did a really well job on ""What difference does it make"" and ""Thats entertainment."" There are some parts on the album where Trevor hits some high notes, which is somthing you never hear on a face to face album. But overall I think they did a very good job on these cover songs."
1,"Worthless book, and I am a fool!!!","My compliments to the photographer, but the content of this book is mighty thin. I thought I had finally found a book that would go beyond the basic pasta techniques and that would tell how to make noodles and dumplings. Burn my soul! This book has the basic pasta recipe along with a few recipes for sauces and such. There is nothing in this book that you won't find in a comprehensive cookbook like Betty Crocker. Spaetzle isn't even mentioned! Save your money, friends. Or wait a year until they sell the remainders for 50 cents."
2,"Great Bread, Lousy Durability","This machine has made excellent bread for us, but within six months of buying it, the right clip holding the pan broke. We've limped along with one clip for a year now, since we could never get any information from Zojirushi about repair. The left clip is now giving up, causing us to wake in the middle of the night with the pan clattering around during the knead cycle. And since I'm complaining, the machine cooks at such a low temperature that it's been impossible to make a quick bread.I like the horizontal loaf, and I love our Zojirushi rice cooker, but the problems with the clips, the peeling paddles, and the awful customer service ensure that I won't buy another ZO product with moving parts.I'm currently researching other options, because we've grown to love fresh bread so."
1,Poor customer service and poor baking,"We have tried to use our breadmaker 3 times. After the first flop we called the customer service number. The person at the other end didn't seem to know much other than what other customers told him.The last loaf was not even done baking at the end of all of the cycles, so we put it in the oven. Of course the top had caved in during the process, but after baking it in our oven it did taste good. The first loaf we just threw away and the 2nd loaf was a bit doughy.Needless to say we are not happy. Our old Hitachi never gave us a problem."
4,Zojirushi Traditional loaf bread machine,"This is my second Zojirushi, and my 3rd bread machine. I really like the brand Zojirushi, but I like the upright loaf bread machine much better. It doesn't do any good to like the upright loaf more because they no longer make this model. I like the fact you can look in the window and see how the machine is doing. I like how this machine does it's own preheating so you can throw everything in and go about your business. I will stick with this brand even though I like the upright better. I think Zojirushi is the best quality bread machine out there."
2,Get the Panasonic one instead!!,"I bought this item in order to replace my Panasonic one which I've been using for 9 years. I chose Zojirushi after reading tons of positive reviews (I also liked the fact that it produces horizontal bread)...BIG MISTAKE!! The good thing about this product is that you can see what's going on inside as it makes your bread, but the quality of the bread is not as great as the Panasonic one. The crust control doesn't work; it gets very dark on the sides and on the bottom and the top doesn't get dark enough. Anyways, I returned this after baking a couple of loaves and confirming my disappointment, and I bought a newer version of the Panasonic one instead. It makes great bread. Taste is what matters the most. Don't get this, get the Panasonic instead!!!"
3,Not as good as i had hoped,"Doesn't get the crust done very well, and has trouble mixing in things like nuts (at least for the 1.5 pound recipes which is all i use). Generally things improve if i add 1/4 cup more water. Sides are getting a little scratched from scraping nuts and misc around in vain attempt to blend it. A vertical machine might do better. But it's reasonably good."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Read all the reviews and thought this model was the best. After receiving the breadmaker, reading the directions and setting it up, we fired it up and waited for our bread. After an hour, we took a peek and noticed that the ingredients weren't mixed. Further investigation determined that the gearing driving the kneading paddles didn't move. Unsat for a brand new machine."
5,best bread machine,I have been using a National bread machine for about 7 years making a loaf a week on the average. Last year I bought the Zojirushi to have another machine. What an improvement in bread quality! The twin blades make a huge difference. French bread is much less time. clean up is much easierC
1,Not Satisfied,"At first it worked OK, then problems. Trying to reach customer service on their 800 is impossible. Try dialing the number before you purcahse to verify my statement. Even though I had the machine for only 5 weeks, I still was required to send back for warrenty service, postage paid. Then they returned it to me saying everything was OK, that a small amount of crust that I had left on the shaft caused the problem. Of course, that was ridiculus, so I am stuck with a defective machine. They don't honor their warrenty or answer their telephone help line. BEWARE."
1,Hate it!,"I bought this machine several months ago but did not have a chance to use it until this past week. I had a Russell Hobbs before and loved it. I have tried making plain dough and bread, it does not mix well and even after trying different yeast it does not raise. I would return it in a minute if I thought they would still take it back."
4,Cute Movie,It was a good movie & had a good story line. My 11 year old son watched it with me and really liked it.
5,Smart and Sweet,"I bought this movie for my 10-year old daughter and it has been a hit with her and with her friends. To hear the tale of Gabe (a 10-year old Manhattanite) and his view on love was entertaining and thought-provoking. Gabe is cynical about love as a witness to the deterioration of his parents' marriage but cannot stop himself from surrendering his heart to his charming classmate, Rosemary Talesco. The script is smart enough for parents and sweet enough for kids, with emotion and intelligence in every scene. We just watched it again today on a long drive. I got to listen to it without the benefit of the lovely cinematography and found myself ever more appreciative of the tight dialogue."
3,Mixed Feelings personally...,"For me, this movie will very well done, as far as describing first love and the humor. It was not one of those cheaply made, formula following, predictable plot chick flicks. It was also an innocent love story without all the sex and violence.However, what I didn't like was the decription of the first love, it was too true and applies to me in every aspect. It brought back the good and bad memories. The movie also tells the audience that love doesn't last forever, and I don't think that's something people would want to hear... I can explain further about the bad of the movie, but it will probably ruin the ending...I say, watch it, and then draw your own conclusions."
4,size of cards,I liked the content of cards but they are too big for me to shuffle is there any chance they could be made a little smaller
3,is it new,i just want to know if the product is new before i buy it please tell me if its a new or used iteam iteam is mansik m333
4,Works FANTASTIC!!!,"After reading some other reviews about the glass insulation being broken when delivered, I was a little nervous. But it arrived in perfect condition and works like a DREAM! Kept my coffee PIPING hot and the pump worked great, too--I recommend this hot water/coffee urn."
5,Great Way To Serve Coffee,Love it! Now I don't spend all night making more pots of coffee. Keeps it watm and tasty for up to 6 hours. I entertain large groups and this is the perfect solution to having plenty coffee for your guests.
2,8 am to 6 pm???,"I read the reviews for this thermal carafe, and now I wonder if they were being paid to write that. I do not have a problem the the button sticking, yet. I bought it for my mother and she was ecstatic, until 11 AM. At 8 AM she poured boiling water into it and left it there untouched. At 11 AM she felt like another pot of tea but when she poured it out, it was only warm and you can't make tea with warm water. My mother doesn't lie, but she also can't drink anything hotter than warm, so I had to test it myself. I was so convinced by the person whose coffee was hot from 8 PM until 6 AM, but when I poured boiling water into it at 9 AM, it was already lukewarm 3 hours later. I do not recommend this for anyone who likes hot liquids, but it's great for those who like warm liquids."
3,Great Heat Retention- Not good Mechanical Part,"Great in keeping beverages hot for long periods of time. But only gave it 2 stars because the BUTTON that is used to open & close for pouring. Sticks and is inpossible to clean..can not be removed from thermos. Checked with Zojirushi about this was informed that only the ""STOPPER"" can be removed and cleaned. The ""STICKING"" takes place in the button area that is spring loaded. If this design flaw is corrected..I would give it 5 star rating. As stated above..GREAT FOR KEEPING BEVERAGES HOT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME!!!!! IF YOU CAN GET IT OPEN TO POUR!!!!!"
2,Disappointed,Don't spent the money on this product if you want to keep your coffee hot for more than one hour. Keeps it warm for 3-4 hours.
1,Hardly the Solid Argument I was Looking for,"Mr. Strobel takes the word of biblical scholars and presents it as his case for believing in Christ and Christmas. The way he simply glazes over the fact that the date we now celebrate Christmas was picked by a Christian official years after Jesus' death to conflict with a Pagan holiday is stated and then completely ignored. The author does nothing to address real questions about Christ and how Christmas came to be, instead he simply glosses over major questions that any non-Christian or real investigator may have. I was very disappointed in this book."
4,For Skeptics or Believers,"If you want to read a Christmas story, Strobel's The Case for Christmas is about the best one. Strobel is an award-winning journalist who investigates the true identity of the child in the manger. This small paperback invites you to consider why Christmas really matters. In case you didn't know, it's not about Santa folks. The Case for Christmas is taken from The Case for Christ and is a quick read that can really help skeptics or believers. Other books by this Yale Law School graduate and former legal editor of the Chicago Tribune include The Case for Faith and The Case for a Creator."
4,Canned Heat,You almost have to be my age for this stuff. Great oldies from the past.Swinging melodies.
3,A Difficult Read but Insightful,"Doctrines of the BibleAfter finishing this book, I realized it was better to start reading the chapter about The Church first, then the chapter about The Bible. This is because each chapter looked like its own academic thesis, and hence did not flow seamlessly onto the consecutive chapter. I recommend this for literary enthusiasts who want to see how other literary enthusiasts perceive the Holy Bible. The language of the book can make you cross-eyed or, in my case, I grabbed my KJV and looked up the material myself over prayer."
4,Beware- Just a repackaging of former albums,"Tony Bennett is still great, but this collection is just a repackaging of (disc 1)""Tony Bennett Sings a String of Harold Arlen"" and disc 2 is most of ""Tony Bennett at Carnegie Hall June 9th, 1962"". The outside packaging says nothing about this, but the discs do. So if you have these previous albums, no need to buy duplicates."
1,This is a Powerpoint presentation printed and bound.,"This book looks like someone made a really long power point presentation and printed it out and had it made into a book. It could probably be useful for a teacher, but for a student it's not very useful. In addition, you must have full access to the businessobjects software in order to use the examples. In addition, this book has absolutely no coverage of the XI R2 web/java interface whatsoever."
5,A Killer Novel!,"Don't start reading until you have the time. I found myself captivated, spellbound, and utterly mezmerized by the story that evolves on the very first page.I was expecting a terrorist 9/11 story. Instead I got the best Vietnam story I have ever read. I am a Vietnam Veteran and this is without a doubt the finest depiction of the war everyone wants to forget ever done.Who is this guy anyway? I bought the book on a whim. It was packaged with another book and it turns out to be a real gem, a great find. Thank you Amazon.com! Great marketing.If you like a modern day thriller that is set against a totally believeable historical backdrop, then this is the book for you. I loved it."
5,Awsome Game!!,"When I bought this game shortly after the release I was looking foward to a great game acoording to the reviews. And the reviews were right!!! I LOVE this game!! It is one of the first games on xbox 360 to really show some light on the ""uncharted"" areas of this beautiful console.If your like me, I love freedom and space in video games. This game gives you a LOT of space. It takes at least 30 minutes to drive along one side of the awesome island following the speed limit. The cars are amazing! There are manufactuers from Ford to Audi to Ferrari. I could write 30 pages of features about this game. But I dont have that much time.The only downside to this game is it gets very annoying to drive everywhere.But other than that it is a very sweet game. For your sake please purchase this game!!!!A Very Happy Gamer"
5,Must try it!,"I've had my 360 for a few months now and like most people, I am always looking for games that deliver on the promise of what the 360 was supposed to deliver. TDU may not be perfect but its pretty darn close. The graphics look like a movie. While I may never be able to afford 99% of the cars in the game, the variety of cars is unreal. I also think it is very cool that there are motorcycles in the game to go with the cars. Hawaii also felt like a perfect place for this game to take place because it adds to the fantasy element of the game. I can't wait until the game comes out officially and there are a bunch of people to race with."
3,desent game,I did not pay that much for this game !graphcially it is very nice but the control is a bit dissapointing !I have it on my drive wheel and it still feel sluggish!...its harder to drive on the game than driving it realife!( I guess thats the problem with all the simulator type games)
3,Fantastic,"This game is amazing,the cars u have to play with are so freaking hot.Not to mention the places where u get to drive.this is the ultimate driving game of 2006 and 2007."
4,An album that grows on you,"This is an eclectic, fun soundtrack that grows on you. It sounds a little strange at first, but after a while you realize that there's a great mix of tunes here. There are all different kinds of songs, and that's what I love about it."
1,Dillinger Cover Band...,"...a really, really BAD Dillinger cover band. Riffs stolen to the point on plagerism from the mathcore legends (who have fizzled due to poor vocal talent).This is pure crap!"
1,My omelet stuck,"I just made myself an omelet in this relatively expensive skillet. I bought it strictly for making omelets that don't stick to the pan. And even with butter, my omelet stuck to the pan. It was very disappointing and a waste of my money."
1,Not at all worth the money.,"I'm baffled by all of the deliriously positive reviews of this product. It works passably as a saucier/sautéed, but if you fry anything without a ludicrous amount of lipids, it will stick. Maybe I (and the other negative reviewers) got bad copies, but if the QC is that erratic at Calphalon, maybe it's not worth using in any case.I realize Amazon reviews have become a sounding board for frustrated people who feel the need to condescend to everyone and show off their vast knowledge of cooking (or music, or photography, or literature, or whatever), but my claims that this pan is poor is not predicated on ignorance, as some bitter reviewers suggest. I own the pan, use it a lot, and it's lousy. And I don't have time to write a 15-page review, because I have a life and a job."
3,Wrong Calphalon.,"The Infinite series is sigificantly better. I how 1 pan and will be getting more to replace the pans I currently have. This one is OK, but the food sticks. I have done everything they suggested."
4,I liked this product but had to send it back,I had to send it back because my dads foot was to wide for the shoe it should have been for a women instead a man size.
2,SUBSTITUTE 3 Review,"Second straight-to-video sequel to 1995's ""The Substitute"" has part-time mercenary, part-time substitute teacher Treat Williams taking over for a college professor who was brutally beaten by her juiced-up jock students. Williams and his new team of operatives are out to uncover a steroid scandal linking the university's football team to a local Mafia goon. Pretty good in a dumb Saturday afternoon movie type of way but the third act is more cheesy and full of holes then... well, Swiss cheese, I guess."
1,Does not regulate voltage,"I live in Nairobi, where the power fluctuates quite a bit. I bought two of these units to protect my electronic equipment, but have unplugged them. They're worse than useless as voltage regulators--I checked with a voltmeter and it did little to regulate the power fluctuations--and they repeatedly shut off the power to equipment, including my internet router, TV, and stereo, causing other problems. If you're looking for a voltage regulator that regulates voltage, don't waste your money on this."
1,Dissapointing Service,"I ordered two of these voltage regulators. The first one I opened had the top half of the case broken on one side so it would flop open but it seemed to work. The second one sounded like it was full of rocks. Parts were obviously broken inside. I requested two new ones. They quickly shipped out one to me, with return shipping covered which was great because these things are heavy. The new one had its lights come on telling me there was a voltage problem. The other one I received plugged into the same outlet said the power was fine. Two multimeters showed 118 VAC so it looked to be stable. I sent requests to swap these out but never heard back. This was a deal at the time of purchase but these are available for the same price a plenty of places now. I'd like to get my money back and just buy from somebody else. They must have gotten a damaged lot of this product."
4,Updated: Cheap because it is the wrong enclosure?,"Purchased this last week. Box, serial tag and QC slip all confirm it as a Line-R 1200. Silk screen label on front of unit shows Line-R 600 though.Minor detail, but how do I really know it's the one I ordered? Returned it, will wait to see if the new one is the same.Update: I got a new one, it was the correct model. Has been working a charm ever since I got it. Very reliable. I only wish I could take it with me to the UK, but it's 120V only (though I'm guessing there's good reason for that, as it is a voltage regulator!)."
5,The best for the price,"The APC LE1200 1200VA Voltage Regulator is top of the line for the price. I couldn't believe the prices of some voltage regulators. Who needs battery backup for their A/V equipment? Don't let Best Buy talk you into purchasing one of those overrated/priced monster boxes. Though they are good, they are way too overpriced. Buy APC!"
4,Does a job,"For the price I'm happy with it. For the price.I wish it were quiter and faster. It seems to struggle to keep the voltage around 115 and seldom reaches 120 except when dealing with spikes. A cheap voltometer would be welcome but it does an admirable job if not a superb job, but for 50 or less its hard to fault."
5,Eliminated Power Issues Treadmill Was Having,"When we moved into our new house and put our treadmill in the basement weird things started to happen. It would randomly just shut off when being used, which I can tell you is a very annoying thing when you're running and the machine stops. Can cause for a tense moment or two and you try not to injure yourself with the suddenly non-moving surface below.I did my best troubleshooting as to what was going on and guessed that it was a power issue. I found this device here on Amazon and figured for the price it was worth a shot. I plugged it into the wall and then plugged the treadmill into it and the problems were gone.So the bottom line is this device does what it is supposed to do and keeps the power at a nice steady flow. I highly recommend it!"
4,Looking Within,"Demian is a gripping story of finding oneself; of travels within and ""without""; of pure imagination; of longing. In many ways, it is a fairytale, a memior, a poem. Though at times tedious to read, the images roam like a dream throughout the prose. Some of the words and sentences can philosophically strike the reader: ""those who wear the mark have found themselves"" or ""fate and temperament are two words for one and same concept"". Deep with meaning and artistic images, Demian must be read and appreciated."
5,This was perfect,"The first time I did a turkey brine I used a plastic bucket. It grossed me out. I saw this bag on Amazon and I thought I would try this option instead. The bag is super sturdy and held my 25 lb. bird. It sealed very tightly so no unexpected leaks in your fridge while it sits in there for 24 hours. Also, I liked that it didn't take up all the space in my fridge like the bucket did. I recommend this bag. It's worth the money."
2,Brining Bags,"You have to make sure you ONLY seal this bag when you are absolutely certain that you are ready to do so. It is impossible to undo the zip once it is done. There was only 1 bag, not 2, so it's pretty expensive."
5,united states pharmacopieia national formulary 24th edition,"I guess the book is the best among the best because here and outside the United States, people are depending on this book because everything is there when it comes to pharmaceutical items"
4,Enjoyable rockin' holiday hits,"Whenever I'm putting together homemade tapes of Christmas music, this collection plays a major part in it. With the exception of the sound quality of Call Me For Christmas by Gary U.S. Bonds; this is a really good rock & pop collection of tinsel tunes. Highly recommended."
5,great shoe,"I am a woman who ordered this shoe for running laps in the pool and water aerobics class because I have big feet! Anyone with weak ankles or arches this is a great supportive shoe while working out in the water. I have a very wide foot and the first time or two I wore them they were tight, but now they fit perfectly! I love these shoes, would buy them again, but probably not in the solid grey/black for a woman, they look a little too manly and clunky if you know what I mean, but for a guy they are great."
1,Speedo Hydro XP = PAIN,"I bought these shoes brand new a few weeks ago, and wore them at Splashin' Safari water park earlier today for the first time. Big mistake! Within the first 30 minutes I developed a huge blister above both heals do to the hard mesh friction rubbing agianst my skin. Speedo did a really poor job on the construction of these shoes. They need to go back to the drawing board. Why put such a hard material in the shoe heal for god's sake?! It's a water shoe! You don't wear socks with them! The bottom line here is that the Speedo XP's are like wearing a cheese grater strapped to your heal. I'm done with water shoes. I'll stick to wearing my sandals in the water. They're a lot more comfortable. I've never had a whole lot of luck with water shoes anyway, and this pair was definitely no exception. The Speedo XP's are the worst I've worn by far. I recommend everyone stay away from them!"
2,Not bad...,"I took this to Bahamas with me in October. Although I guess it's my fault, I thought they were slip on shoes and didn't tighten up the laces. It caused a nasty blister on my Achilles tendon that lasted for the whole week! Yucko!!One could wear them with socks though."
3,It's a Visual Medium for Pete's Sake,When I received the book I was surprised that Pilbrow had written a 450+ page book on lighting and there were only 6 pages of color photos and scattered pencil drawings and black/white photos in select areas. This is analogous to explaining engine repair without detailed diagrams. The lighting designer is a visual person. It is a visual medium. Words are poor vehicles to carry the ideas of this art form. I think Pilbrow missed the mark. That's why I'm returning the book.
5,Portrait of an Sharp Businessman,"In too many books and movies, all businessmen are portrayed as ruthless and greedy cretins. Mr. Hawley writes from a different persepective and one that I share. The idea that business is a noble pursuit and does much more to elevate society at large than it does to diminish it.There will always be cheats, crooks and con men, but they are the exception rather than the rule. Hawley also paints a vivid picture of how the governments tinkering with the economy and taxation affects the ways that business people respond to such actions.This is a very good book and I think people who like Atlas Shrugged will enjoy all of Hawley's books..."
4,Chad,"Brakes were installed with recommended sport sedan rotors. Great improvement over stock braking, would highly recommend. Adds a great amount of safety to any car. Works great well worth the extra cash."
5,These are the greatest!,"I loved Richard Marx when I was a teenager, and listening to this album makes me remember why! All of the hits I expected, plus a few I wasn't as familiar with, but love just as much now that I've listened to them. The thing I especially like about this CD is that the liner notes are written by Richard where for each song he gives an insight into what was going on with his life and why he recorded it. If you ever liked any of Richard's songs in the past, you will not be disappointed with this purchase."
5,Marx at his early best.,Richard Marx is the finest song writer and vocalist of our time. His words and music reaches the deepest part of my heart. And he is just like a fine wine; he only gets better with age. I hope to keep listening to him for years to come.
2,Very Average,Richard Marx has a few songs I Like.Don't Mean Nothing is a good song and a trip cuz it trashes the Music Business.that's The Don Henley Effect mixed in with Richard.Henley Produced the cut it has that Eagles Vibe going on.Should've Known Better was catchy in a Kenny Loggins kind of way.Keep Coming Back was the cut with Luther Vandross adding vocals.If Marx had have used this type of song as a Springboard then I would dig his Work More.but more often than not he is Happy in Sappyville.He used to Sing so much for CHicago that I thought he was gonna join them but in a way he did he followed their Pattern of making Sappy POP.Lionel RICHIE Sadly did this way too Many times as well.
4,for when you want to feel young & groovy again,"Great songs in a variety of moods...a must-have if you were into the film and its soundtrack. Some tunes weren't in the film but rather almost were, or are cited as relevant to the characters. The only beef I have is with the artwork: as with the first soundtrack, Kevin McKidd is nonexistent! wtf? It seems they replaced him with the girl Diane who was NOT a part of the ""gang"". Annoying."
1,Who's Running the Show at WB?,"Pure travesty. This collection is a slap in the face. Pure junk. Where are the classic cartoons? Who's running the show at WB? It's obviously somebody who doesn't know what she is doing. I'll even go so far as to say that the cartoons from the '60s on this set aren't that good. Where's the rest of the classic cartoons from the 50s and early 60s? Those are the ones customers want, not something made in the 2000s. This is a pure money grab by WB. People who don't know any better will end up buying this only to be extremely disappointed.On top of all the classic Looney Tunes yet to be released, what's WB waiting for with the balance of the classic Popeye cartoons? They started releasing sets of those a few years ago but then stopped. Either the rats are running the ship at WB, or the person in charge is a complete dope."
2,Warners hits a new low,"This is not a review of the content, simply the ""presentation."" Warner's has decided to use generic menus, which I'm sure will continue on any future DVD release in this series. Poor form."
2,Not what it seems,"These cartoon shorts are newer. Some are digital, and none of them are as good as the more memorable episodes from the past. I assumed they were the best ones from the 60s-70's, WRONG... these are not the funny oldies i remembered and wanted to watch again. Disappointing."
2,"Both games, kina lame","I was at college and wanted something to help pass time and the 4x4 Evo did for a little bit, but then got pretty boring. You can't drive over rocks, even the smallest rocks...which doesn't make any sense to me in a 4x4 off-road game. I don't remember the Muscle Car game being any better."
3,they sent a different disc,"Well, I ordered this item and when It finally got here I found that it was a different collection. On the page it says that it has 26 tracks but the disc that I recieved only had 19. I was disapointed because some of the songs I really wanted did not come in this disc. Also on the pic. it claims that it's a 2CD collection with 26 songs and I recieved one with only 19 tracks.Other than that this was a pretty good album."
3,Low Carb and low fat - is that what you really want?,"I've read through the whole book, but haven't actually tried any of the recipes yet. They sound good, but she uses non-fat products frequently. A good low carb diet needs good fats included in it. If I use these recipes I will be using products that still have the fat in them."
3,Mel Bay's Complete Mandolin Method/93221,As a beginer I believed there would be more practical aspects such as picking etc. However it is a valuable tool for my learning.
2,Classical,This course is meant for the lover of classical music. It starts with explaining the classical music notation. This increases the difficulty for beginners: you have to learn the classical notation and also learn to play the mandolin. As it doesn't have the tablature notation it will take some time before you can really play a tune. Bit old-fashioned teaching style.
3,"Great shelves, weak wheels","The shelves are what I had expected. The wheels that came with them are pretty weak. If you load up the shelves below the weight restrictions, then wheels have a hard time rotating and I have noticed that caused them to start wollowing out the bottom of the poles they are attached to. Disappointing...."
1,Nothing like what I expected,This video is nothing like what I expected. It is so simple that anyone could make a video exactly like it and save themselves $25. I have a child with Down Syndrome and it is not helpful for him at all. Sesame Street teaches him the same thing and in a more exciting way.
2,All I can say about this is unique,"I admit the songs on this CD are played out, but that doesn't mean they are bad songs. There really isn't anything special about this CD, but the interesting thing about it is how you get different versions of the same track on the CD. The reason I bought this was because it seemed like a good deal for a 2 disc, and to be honest its not a waste of money. Another thing I noticed about this cd was that the DJ (I forget who it is) added some effects. I haven't seen too much of this on recorded CD's before, but a welcome change."
2,good song--don't need three versions of it though,"OK, I get singles have remixes on them but three versions of the title track which is pretty decent. The odd thing is none of the versions on the single are the original. To get the original you have to buy the Def, Dumb & Blonde album.You figure that type of marketing genius out.By the way, the other track is ""Bike Boy"" not ""Bike"" as the listing suggests."
5,Works great for my 3 phones!,"This card came within the week and worked on my Chocolate, KRZR and 8300 without any problems at all!!"
5,Great Gadget,This little thing works just fine. Fits into your Cell phone or digital camera and card reader. Lots of storage space and little battery waste.
4,"Inner Journey, Outer Journey.","This is much more than a travel book. It's a book that has a deep respect for the ""natives"" it describes, and I really like that.Like all good books about travel, this book is about Jensen's inner journey as well. This work is sensous and it makes me want to travel. We need travellers instead of frigtened people who stay at home watching tv, disliking foreigners, Muslims, and the ""darkness"" they perceive is out there.'"
3,ed who?,"contains at least 2 good songs! the opener ""fancy that,"" and ""love is"" are bone fide classics. the rest of this album (especially if you buy the reissue with the bonus tracks) is kinda boring in a late '60s-I'm on ESP-DISC'-and totally ate too much bad acid and am overly educated but not really a musician- kind of way. Still though, those 2 songs are great, you know, if you like The Fugs, Pearls Before Swine, or the Charlie Manson record, none of which sound anything like this. Read somewhere that he made another album but have never seen or heard it."
2,Used to taste better...,"I was severely dissappointed in the Pamela's Peanut Butter cookies. They have almost no peanut butter taste--even with a couple of chopped up pieces of peanuts on top. I had these cookies a year ago and they tasted much better. I'm trying to figure out what to do with the other 5 boxes I bought--even putting ice cream with them doesn't help. The only good thing was that the cookies were soft, not hard as a rock."
1,Just Awful...,"Marriage of convenience stories have been done so many times they need a new take on them to be interesting. But this one does not. Yet another story of the virgin bride lusting for her husband, who also lusts for his wife. It seems our lusting hero, Lord Henry, can not keep his hands off is new bride, Julia. But why? On page 100, ""accepting his lips with a curious questing as her supple, big-boned mannish body..."" At every turn, Henry thinks she is not attractive. The author goes out of her way describing all the reasons why Julia is mannish. So what is up with the attraction thing? And I did not like Henry. He refers to Julia is his thoughts at his virgin bride and a virgin bride she will stay. That is, actually, cruel. Of course, they get together, but this reader had no respect for Henry or Julia, for that matter. Also, way to much horse stuff in the book. Frankly, Julia was a bit batty re. her horses."
2,CD COSTLY,why is this cd so much and how many songs are on it. Just want to know although I love his voice this cd is very expensive then the other artist.
3,An OK DVD,"I own many Sesame Street DVDs. This one is good, but there are better ones out there. On the plus side, my 23 month old loves it and it entertains her. Another plus is that it teaches the concept of sharing and friendship. I gave it three stars because there are Sesame Street DVDs that I actually enjoy better and they are just as appealing to my daughter. I would suggest ""Elmo's Sing Along Guessing Game"", or ""Sesame Streets 25th Birthday Musical Celebration""."
5,loved it,was not expecting it so soon.. My 2 year old loves elmo she was so excited to put it in thanks alot your great
1,Not a good movie for toddlers,"My 2 year old loved this movie when we got it for him. He still loves it to date and cries to watch it. Ever since he claims everything to be his, he uses the words mine, me, I a lot. There are also other words that he learned from the movie, like greedy, stupid and more. I do not think that this is the best movie for a little child. I read some reviews of kids who got scared and upset for elmo losing his blankie. My son is almost 2.5 years and I am trying hard to get the idea of ""Mine"" out of his head, he wants everything to be his own, funny but frustrating sometimes."
3,Starw Dogs:,"Ok, so the Movie was ok. The Movie had alot of cool scenes but you knew what was going to happen we have seen this story over and over again. The acting was good. Its not one for the collection but definetly check it out!"
2,Really kind of silly,"I'm really surprised at the reviews that take so much time to analyze this film - character development, plot devices, etc. All I could come out with is ""where is Alexander's southern accent?"" I understand that he's Swedish and does a rockin' mid-west American no accent accent. But I'm from Georgia. I know that if you're that deep in South, you're gonna have an accent. Spoilers! And what's this crap about you don't understand southern daddies and southern daughters. Of course she'd know how to shoot a gun. And clean a gun. And take one apart and put it back together. Good grief. Why was Amy not picking them off from the 2nd floor while they are all hanging around in her front yard? This movie is silly and other than one or two moments, not exciting at all."
1,HOLLYWOOD TRULY HATES THE SOUTH!!!!,"I don't know why they do but after watching this movie I am thoroughly convinced to the marrow of my bones that Hollywood absolutely, positively, hates the south. I don't know why... but they do. Hollywood portrays southerners as ignorant, stupid, racist, murderous, gang-rapists, no less. I wonder if Hollywood had tried to malign some other group particularly a minority group, with the same wanton maliciousness and vengeance it uses to malign southerners, if this movie would be tolerated and its creators not ostracized and pilloried?"
1,Don't bother,"If you are into violent films that are all about the ""sick"" factor, than this is for you! Mulitple animals are hunted down, hung or tortured. A bunch of ""rednecks"" take over their small town and go after a well educated man and his girlfriend. Yes, this happy little flick is full of grotesque, weird and deranged moments! It will leave you feeling like you need a good shower to wipe off all the stink! Shame on James and Kate for being in such a degrading and horrific production!"
3,"Well filmed, well staged, but ...","A lot of thisStraw Dogsremake is well filmed and well staged and there are some good performances but, ultimately, it relies too constantly on people doing stupid things for stupid reasons for me to buy in and care."
4,Straw Dogs,"I thought this was a good movie, good story. Edge of your seat movie **SPOILER** I do have a problem watching rape scenes in movies; murder, blood, gore I can handle."
5,A Book That Transends Time,"I read this book recently for the Nandi Bookclub in Atlanta, GA. Once I started reading I discovered that I could not put the book down. I took it everywhere and read everywhere - I finished it in a week. The book became very real and I found myself talking to the characters, especially Sara and her family. I highlighted many sections of the book so I could reference the book's ""lessons"" later. For example, the three types of men: man, boy and a man with a little boy left in him.Although the book is set many years ago, many of the situations (or reactions to situations) and lessons to be learned are applicable today.If you or your bookclub is looking for an excellent read to fill your heart, mind, body, spirit and soul, then you need to purchase The Memoirs of Sara Harvey! Your life will be enriched!"
5,Convenience and Quality. It's worth to own!!!,"We love tea. So this airpot became a must-have item now.We just boil water once every morning. Then we keep brewing tea with the hot water out of the pot all day long until evening/dinner. If you need hot water all day long, this is the one worth to own due to the convenience and quality."
1,Blew fuses!,"I had to pay rather a lot of money to have this shipped to Amsterdam (after UPS decided it didn't want to ship it to me in Canada for much less) and the first time I used it, it blew the fuse in the hotel room. Now I have to pay even more money to send it back!"
1,Warning: 16-bit adapter cards are OLD TECHNOLOGY! Stick with 32-bit,"I don't know why these types of cards are still on the market--they are old, slow, and obsolete. Instead, search for 32-bit Cardbus adapters such as the ones made by Viking, Delkin, or Lexar, which are many times faster but not much more expensive. And, they fit in the same PC card slot on most laptops made in the last decade. The 32-bit cards I have used are even a bit faster than USB 2.0 and Firewire.You can spot 32-bit cards by the gold strip at the top of the card. No gold strip? Then prepare to wait an hour or more for your data to transfer, while your laptop is brought to its knees. The old silver cards may be fine for storing and playing mp3s, or may be needed for laptops made more than 10 years ago, but any large amount of data--such as GBs of photos or video-- will take quite a while to copy over. Why would you want a reader that is SLOWER than your flash media?"
1,Have seen no results,I have not noticed any changes in my hair. I can not give a honest comment. I have used it for the last 60 days. Will use until all gone.
2,Could Be A Great Deal Better,"It so happens that I purchased several accessories to the Bosch Table SawBosch 4100-09 10-Inch Worksite Table Saw with Gravity-Rise Standbefore I bought the saw itself. The reason for doing so -- yes, I admit it was rather warped logic, if even logic at all -- was that once I had all those accessories, I just would feel forced to buy the new saw. You can see the duality, right? Part of me wanted that saw BAD, and part of me did not want to spend the money.Anyway, once I purchased the saw (see my review elsewhere on Amazon.com), I installed the dust collector bag and started using it. Before too long it developed a tear that grew increasingly larger. Because this saw is advertised as being a contractor's tool, then it should be of a quality to support that. Not just the saw, but its accessories should be, too. A heavier gauge fabric or a different material altogether for this bag would have been appropriate. Sorry Bosch, I'm not impressed."
4,Dust Collection on the Jobsite,I purchased this dust collection bag when I purchased my Bosch 4100 tablesaw. This tablesaw goes on almost every job with me and I like having the dust collection bag so that I'm not sweeping up as much sawdust at the end of the day.
3,Bosch Dust Collector Bag,Well...It looks bigger in the picture. Being Bosch I would have expected the material to be a little more durable. It does catch 60 to 70 percent of the sawdust as advertised but you have to empty the bag often. I feel it was not worth what I paid ($12 and change). Six or seven dollars would be a good price for this item.
2,So-so,"About 70 percent of the sawdust makes it into an empty bag with the amount becoming less as the bag fills. When the bag is over 50% full, most of the saw dust goes in the air, on the floor, etc. I have since stopped using the bag because my shop vac hose fits the sawdust port."
1,Martie,I got this for my husband and it wasn't all that great. He says they will have to greatly improve it before he would ever consider purchasing another one.
2,Dust 'Collector' - - -NOT,Bought this along with the saw since I knew I'd be using it inside for installing new flooring.It 'collected' maybe half of the saw dust. Finally disconnected this waste of money and hooked the shop vac to the saw with much better results.
2,Save your money & just hook your shop vac up,"While a great concept, this dust collection bag proved of little worth to my dust collection efforts. I found that hooking my shop vac up to the dust ejection port on the back of my Bosch table saw is infinitely better than this bag, which only collected about 50-60% of the sawdust"
2,RJC,"This dust collection bag captured a good portion of the sawdust, but creates too much resistance to airflow, causing sawdust to blow back in your face. I had to take it off. Disappointing."
4,Bosch TS1004 Table Saw Dust Collector Bag,worth the money but dont think you can use table saw inside without making a mess. I love the Bosch 4100 table saw I have and this does cut down on a large amount of sawdust blowing everywhere
3,"works ok, but should be shorter","This works ok, but I haven't tested it against hooking up my shop vac since I can 't find an adapter for my Ridgid vac.I wish they had designed the bag 4 inches shorter. When I fold up the gravity stand, the bag hangs down and gets caught up in the wheel. More than once, I folded the bag over the rod to roll the stand around, forgot to unfold it and then used the saw. The bottom port filled up quickly and then really threw the dust back up through the blade area."
4,try it !,"Marco Conidi really is a great italian rocker. When I'm listening his music I can't don't think to Bruce Springsteen. Some songs are terrific,like ""Mr Brown"" or ""E tu com'eri"". Try it,com'on..."
2,Book of Acts- Visual Bible,"It is rare that I provide a negative review, but I felt compelled to do so for this video. I was hoping for the recreation of the events of the book of Acts to be realistic enough to use it as a teaching tool. Unfortunately, the rather wooden acting by those playing the character parts dampened my desire to use it. The video does faithfully follow the NIV text which is helpful, but the unconvincing dialogue by actors renders it unusable as a tool to bring the text to life. Instead, it does the opposite by drawing attention to the less than meaningful dialogue. Richard Kiley playing the part of Luke was the exception."
3,Limited but useful,"Here's the entire book of ACTS, limited by a budget that is very, very small for a project of immense scope. Luke narrates parts; this avoids a few problems. It's handy to be able to access the story by chapters. It may not be good cinema but it's much better than nothing, and it provides some authentic Mediterranean atmosphere. It should be most appreciated in a family circle or Sunday School where people are tolerant of amateurish productions."
3,Delta 36-550,"Now keep in mind the price here. It's nice to have a table saw, and if you only have about $200 to spend, its worth having. The largest problem I have with it is the fence. Every time I move the fence I have to check to make sure that it is parallel to the blade. Once parallel, it works fine, but having to check each time can become a pain. If you decide to go for this, I would recommend setting it in a larger surface work space with a better fence (which another reviewer has apparently done)."
3,Edginess lost,"I must agree with the second reviewer. The voices in this CD are good and the translations mostly cleverly rendered into Spanish, especially Jenny La de Los Piratas. However, it is true the arrangements do not have that Kurt Weill edginess. It is like listening to Weill in easy listening arrangements. Brecht would surely say that this is a very ""culinary"" Weill. I do however enjoy the CD, especially Ana Belen."
4,Underated,"As a late comer to LRB music. I was quite impressed with this CD. The tight harmonies which they are known for did not disappoint. However, the melodies are some of the best ever from LRB. From 'No Reins' on. This was their last very good effort. It should have done better on the radio, but unfortunately at the time Duran Duran, Billy Idol and others were on. This gets better with age."
5,Great Alumb,Here's the Little River Band at their best and when i say at their best that is exactly what i mean cause there ain't no sorry songs on this alumb or cd no matter which one you got you know what i mean. As i was telling my cousin Travis that all of the songs should have been hits so buy your copy of No Reins today.Rondall
1,Not up to the Bosch standard,"I own and use a number of Bosch tools and I've been thrilled with quality of construction and design in each of them (4000 table saw, bosch colt palm router, bosch 3/8"" drill).Which is why I am completely surprised at the terrible quality of these insert plates. They are made of very thin, very flimsy plastic. If you push down on them they will bend. On thin workpieces this means your cut-line can get screwed up if you provide too much (and I'm not talking about a lot) downward pressure! For a product that is supposed to improve the quality of your cuts, these inserts are a failure.I would not buy these plates. If you need a zero clearance insert I think your best option is to make your own which is, unfortunately, rather difficult for this particular saw."
2,lacking support,The insert is made of plastic and when you raise the blade to cut through the insert it cuts it in half leaving very little support when you run material over it. Because it's made of plastic it flexes downward as you run the material being cut over it. This item should be made of metal like the other inserts and have the plastic insert only where the blade comes through. This would provide for better support
1,A piece of junk,"I love the saw (though I recommend replacing the stock blade immediately with a quality blade, try a Forrest Woodworker II, you'll think you were using a top-of-the-line cabinet saw), but this insert is a worthless piece of junk. Cheap, flexible plastic that doesn't stay flat and bends easily with any pressure on it. The support it provides is so flimsy I expect it crosses the line into dangerous. The saw is so great it really deserves to have respectable accessories."
3,Cheaply made but gets the job done,"Based on the price I didn't have high expectations for this insert but I was still surprised at how thin and flimsy the plastic was. The metal anti-kickback guards on the insert had come loose in shipping and had to be re-glued before I could even use it. Considering the quality of my Bosch 4100 table saw I was somewhat disappointed. That being said, the insert seems to do an adequate job. Just be sure to raise the saw blade VERY slowly when cutting the kerf in the insert as the plastic is extremely brittle. Having owned a Leecraft insert in the past, I would probably spend the extra $7-$10 next time since the quality is far superior to the Bosch piece. Is it necessary to do that? Probably not, but there is a definite comfort level using quality accessories when working on an important woodworking project."
3,"Cookies are Great,/Arrived Crumbled","We ordered Pamela's Pecan Shortbread Cookies because they are an excellent product. However, when they arrived, we found that almost every cookie had damage; and some were just crumbs. With careful packaging and handling, we strongly recommend this product to those with gluten intolerance."
5,Better than any other,I enjoy these cookies more than any other gluten end or GF. I would choose them even if I wasn't GF
5,Lang lebe DTH,"One of the best CDs that the band has but it's also very sad, because if you listen to one of their older albums it's a lot differnt. You can tell that they are getting old. But the best song on the CD is ""Unsterblich"". Aber jeder der ein Fan ist liebt die Band sowieso also ist dies hier doch zwecklos. Aber wer noch kein Fan ist und etwas von guter Musik versteht sollte sich die Hosen mal anhoern."
4,"Toy May Be Fine, Avoid The Seller","I ordered this toy as a Christmas present for my son. A week after ordering I still had not received any order confirmation from the seller (KazooToys). Instead I got a follow-up email from Amazon explaining that the transaction was in limbo and my card had not been charged. I cancelled the order -- never received any communication from KazooToys.Since then I have seen in other product reviews that they have a pattern of flaky fulfillment, which includes canceling customer's orders without explanation. If you are interested in this toy my suggestion is: Contact the manufacturer directly to find another reseller.I had to give the product a star rating in order to post my comment. Since I never received the toy, the rating is entirely fictional."
1,No Insoles,"Not sure what was going on.If maybe I got a returned pair of shoes but both shoes came with no insoles at all!#%!#$!#^#!^ WTF,,,,,,,,I could see the white bottom and glue from the insoles. Promply returned them and now in market for something else."
3,Shoes,"I ordered the Velcro strap and recieved the tie shoe as shown, but my Son decided to keep them,he wears the Velcro shoe and that is what we ordered.Since then I have recieved a review from the seller."
3,School book,"The cases were too simple for my senior level class, but they do give you the chance to practice financial principals"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I've owned this saw for a year. The price of this saw is its main appeal. It's also portable.However, it has many drawbacks. The miter slot is loose and inaccurate. Attaching a wooden fence to the miter gauge amplifies the problem. The saw is very loud, you'll need ear plugs to use it for an extended period of time. The fence is quite poor, and pains must taken to ensure it's parallel to the blade after every adjustment. Ensuring the blade is parallel to the table is also a frequent activity, as it frequently moves after use. The blade guard is also lousy requiring, as with all other parts on this saw, frequent adjustment.Overall, this is a cheap saw that can be used with some success if you understand the limitations and have a lot of patience."
3,"Workmanlike, but not a five star album","After a thorough listening, I find myself much more in agreement with AllMusic's three star review than the five star reviews given by most of the Amazon reviews. Murray's voice can more than carry the songs in the selection, but she seems to lack the spark that would make the tunes her own. I do appreciate the moderate instrumentation (the producer wisely eschews massed strings, using instead an occasional single violin or cello).Pleasant, consistent, note-perfect, but uninspired."
4,Whistle Down the Wind,The product arrived in less tiem than I expected and was in good condition. I was pleased.
2,Not sure if good for absolute beginner,"My 6 year old wants to play drums, so I got him a pair of junior sticks and this DVD.The blurb says ""you don't even need a drum set, you can practice with cardboard boxes"".The problem is, the DVD doesn't show that until the absolute end, and is just a 2 minute segment.There is no instruction on how to hold the sticks, how to hit, how to sit, or anything the rank beginner would need.Since the beginning player won't be practicing with a band anytime soon, the 4 man band goes way over the heads.He's obviously very good, and this DVD would help someone who already knows how to use the sticks on their way to proficiency without needing to go to a coach or get lessons every week.But, this DVD is just a copy from an older VHS, the production quality is low, and its not for real beginners. So I'm disappointed with the contents, but keeping it because it will be useful as the 2nd and 3rd steps in learning to play the drums. It's just not the 1st step."
3,Tallyho! Surprisingly good air war movie. Good Spitfires!,Really nice story. Great combat footage and other new footage I have never seen anywhere else. Matter of fact I have never seen any of this footage before. Aircraft buffs should like it :) This is really a step above the majority of old war films.
4,"Splendid rendition, if removed from the composer's intention...","This recording has been with me for some time now. I am always torn between this and the Tonhalle Zürich/Bronfman recording. They demonstrate Beethoven on opposing poles and for that alone this is really worth checking. Where Tonhalle is big and expressive, these guys play delicately, even comically (it's pure Haydn sometimes), but always with a rhythmic punch that can knock you for six! Check the end of the Choral Fantasy for the best example of this, the timpani rolling like Art Blakey thunder!A special recording for sure, although I agree with other reviewers that the Fortepiano could be a little higher in the mix. But, but but, is there ever really a COMPLETELY PERFECT recording??!If anybody has some recommendations of other orchestra's that play Beethoven with such rhythmic intensity I would truly appreciate some contact. (shollenator@gmail.com). Happy listening!"
2,not exactly...,"I ordered a used hardcover copy listed as ""GOOD"" quality and I feel like I should have known better! VERY BAD would've been more accurate..broken binding, tons of wear and tear, highlighting/annotating on almost every page (to the point that its more distracting than helpful), etc. Some people might not mind their book being in this condition, but if I wanted a worn out, poor quality textbook, I would've ordered and PAID LESS for a lower quality book. Disappointed! I will be taking the descriptions with a grain of salt if I make another order in the future. Challenging but relatable textbook, made less readable because of the bad quality."
1,Coils smashed in box,"These coils were packaged loosely in the box, and all coils were crushed against each other when they arrived. Even after straightening them up they caused the most jams so far. Would not purchase these again. The packager needs to work on the packaging of these nails."
2,a little deception,"I was under the empression that the chuck set fit the Bosch screw driver.your add links them together. The chuck has a 1/2"" stem and the Bosch can only handle a 1/4"". The bits fit well, but not the chuck. I spent my money on the wrong item."
3,i don't want live versions only,"this would be a perfect anthology, except Slow Ride and Fool For The City are both live cuts, and they're the only versions on this album. there's no mention of this on the outside of the album, and to be honest i feel cheated, i would have never bought this album knowing that the only versions of Slow Ride and Fool included were live versions, i want the real thing. i won't be buying any more Foghat stuff anytime soon."
3,Don't bother!!!!!!!,"This two CD package is not really an anthlogy but just a compulation of their best songs from their last 4 albums together--straight boogie and boring songs. The 2nd CD is great to have--the 1st album (when they were great) but none of the 2nd, third or fourth album cuts were included except Slow Ride. Foghat was more divirse than just boogie cuts--they played blues, blues rock and some great straight out rock songs. I would just get the Greatest Hits Volume 1 and 2 CDs if you want a good sample of their work--and get the 1st & 2nd albums separately on CD--they are available."
5,Logic for young children,"Even very young children will enjoy these stories. This will train their mind to listen/read for details and then stop to think.The stories are good, too!"
2,Not helpful and very hard to follow,I was getting this book because I didn't find the Macromedia manual very helpful. I wish I would have stuck with the manual. This book was much worse. I found it very hard to follow the lessons in the book. It seemed when something started making sense they just stopped and went on to the next lesson. Even the material on the cd-rom seemed disorganized. I also found the artwork on the cd for the examples very poor.
5,Enjoyable cassette.,"I enjoyed listening to this. I'm sure I used to hear some of these songs on the radio back on the 70's.Here are the tracks: 1) Every Moment 2) Out of the Danger Zone 3) Boycott Hell 4) All the Losers Win 5) Jericho 6) Are You Ready 7)Destined to Win 8) Acoustic Medley: Long Distance Runner-Rock Solid-Six,Six,Six 9)Ultimate Ruler 10) Let's Get Upset 11) Competition 12) I Believe 13) Emmanuel 14) Mary 15) If God is for Us"
2,CAVEAT EMPTOR!,"Some of the selections which have been gleaned from various other recordings are quite good. The disappointment comes with the numerous selections performed by the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble. I am sure the performers are accomplished musicians in their own right. Unfortunately, the end result is somewhat akin to listening to Wagner, Fucik, Sousa, etc. being performed by a three-piece combo who have as of late finished an eight-week engagement in the lounge of the Holiday Inn on Route 39."
1,AWFUL BELLY DANCING!,"Amira Mor is a disgrace to the art of belly dance. She has no poise, class, technique or authenticity to style. She has an obvious lack of talent, skill, coordination and elegance that is what bellydancing is all about. She covers up her lack of timing and musical understanding and ability with very skimpy costumes to detract from the content. This is a Belly dance CHEESECAKE!Shame to see the art of my country in ruins...stick to the good dancers and steer clear of this mess!"
5,Classic on computer-based text rendering,"This book is extremely valuable to those hoping to understand and reuse Knuth's classic typesetting algorithms. It contains the every detail needed for the implementation. Each section has a number associated with the source code. Besides, it can also serve as an excellent example of a large project for computer science students. One can understand better ""the art of computer programming"" after reading this book. Of course, you should get prepared to learn Knuth's Pascal/Web sytle language instead of the popular C/Java language."
4,family friendly,I own this video the chaperone its funny not to cheesy for us parents like some family movies we suffer though with our children this is not a movie strict parents would complain about letting their kids watch.
2,the chaperone is not in a lot of theaters wwe why ?,why even bother putting wwe films in theaters vince if your not willing to shell out the money to get them in a lot more theaters come on you have tons of cash vinnie mac I really wanted to see the game in a pg rated family friendly movie just to see how it fares but I guess this is only a ploy to make us wait for his in ring return hopefully soon dvd will have to do but im not supprised wwe drops the ball yet again
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING - don't waste your money,"I thought this would be great to put on two separate floors of my house. One room does not have a phone connection and I thought this was the perfect solution! HA! I sit 3 feet away from the base that has a direct phone line connected and can't hear. On both phones, I get static when I walk out of the room that the base is in."
3,"This is a good, but heavy stand","My rating for this stand would be higher, but I had to return the first one sent to me. The first stand would not fully raise. The second stand did not fully raise out of the box, but after I spent some time evaluating I realized an adjustment was needed.I used this stand to hold my DeWalt miter saw a couple of times. I was happy with all of the features built into this model. There are cheaper saw stands, but they do not have features standard with this stand."
5,Great saw stand,"I was originally going to buy Bosch's miter saw stand but was glad I didn't. I decided that I didn't want to be fumbling with legs of a sawhorse, which the Bosch stand basicly is. I also considered Ridgid's stand but didn't like the multiple steps that were required to set it up (not that there was too much involved).The Delta 36-136 stand sets up easily with a tug with the help of a pneumatic shock. Loosen 2 knobs to extend the support wings and raise the rollers to the desired height. It's simple and it works. The wheels make moving it simple; I usually work in the driveway to avoid sweeping out the garage. The fact that it stores upright and has a small footprint was a big deal to me since I have a 1 car garage that I like to park in.My only regret is that if the wheels were slightly larger diameter, it would be easier to get up and down steps, but it's a negligible complaint."
3,not the best madison finn book,"i read this book a while back but i will do my best to remember it.ok madison is gets like way to obsessed with her ""on the case"" thing,so i though that got kinda boring after a while.and then the whole thing with the missing sheet music was also kinda boring.if there going 2 make a mystery madison finn then at least make one thats more suspensful and interesting.this book was ok and an easy read but i hope the next one in the seires is a little more intertaining.thanx 4 reading my review."
4,Romantic suspense,Family police saga fast paced and good reading following the Kansas City police department made it interesting.I like romantic suspense at it best.
2,Bosch TS1009 Table Saw Molding Head Insert,"Please do not think the Bosch TS1009 insert will fit your Bosch 4000 Table Saw. The screws are different and it is not for the 10 inch blade. So if you were unfortunate like me to buy the Bosch 4000 saw that it came without an insert try finding some other insert or filing or cutting out the TS1009 to fit you 10 inch blade. I did not find screws with the right head to work. May be in the Caribbean we do not have the variety of screws, but it was annoying experience for me."
3,"Love Sinead, but this CD...","...has some terrible audio quality; I have to crank up the volume just to hear her sing, particularly on ""Last day of our acquaintance"" and ""Fire on Babylon""."
2,"you made me cold, and you made me hard","Have to buy this one, because it contains ""You Made Me The Thief Of Your Heart,"" O'Connor's most powerful and most exact expression of familial devastation. The song anchored Jim Sheridan's film ""In The Name Of The Father,"" here it expiates surrounding detritus."
3,Never really got to hear it!!,"I remember buying this on vinyl before CD's really dominated the market. I took it home but really could not play it well due to its being warped. (The record had been in the store and the shrink wrap had pulled tight and warped it, a common problem in the days of LP's. ) I took it back to get another, only to be told they had no more and it was out of print. I always wondered if the album was very good. I never tried to get it again. I only today decided to see what might be available through Amazon for Grace's solo work. I have on vinyl her ""Welcome to the Wrecking Ball"" album and it's not half bad. I'm not surprised though it's out of print. I was going through old albums and got wondering. Though I hate to pay the import price, my curiosity has gotten me. I may yet have to buy it since all the reviews seem so favorable."
4,Slick's Dreams is a worthy listening experience,I first heard this 'album' while stationed in the FRG in the 80's and loved it. Most of the tracks are well blended and worthy of back-to-back listenings. I sense some of Grace's life experiences and wisdom in these recordings and wish she would make more. I gave it four stars because this is a unique recording compared to most of the other stuff.
4,Quick enjoyable read!,I didn't really know what to expect when I bought this book except that the reviews were good. After reading it I must say that it was as good as the reviews said and found the book very interesting. It was laid out very well and easy to follow with enough background so that the reader will understand the points the Rabbi's were making. It gave me a new sense of the way the Rabbi's thought years ago and I guess somewhat still today. I think anyone wanting to learn more about the Torah and Jewish beliefs in general will enjoy this book and learn a lot in the process.
5,excellent introduction to Talmud!,"I checked this book out from a library and was impressed enough to want a copy. With the understanding that no book could condense the entirety of the Talmud into a small volume and maintain the full discourses on the expounding of jewish law, this is as close as I've found on the subject. I am told the Talmud can be a book that you can study for a lifetime. This book as the ""Everyman's Talmud"" is not the Talmud of the rabbinical godal but a short summation of an exhaustive study and can give you quite a feel for the fullness of the work. As a christian I hope this has given me a more complete view of rabbinical law. I feel it has, and would recommend it."
5,Excellent Entry Into The Talmud,"This is an excellent book that collects and organizes the outlook of the sages of the Talmud. While the author may be more inclined to attribute ideas to historical reasons than most Orthodox rabbis, he mostly confines this book to quotations and brief explanations from the vast talmudic literature.The comment by another reviewer of the author's failure to accept Jesus as the messiah is a sad reflection on the attempted Christianization of Judaism. One would hardly expect a talmudic scholar to accept the Christian messiah. The Talmud was written centuries after the life of Jesus and the sages of the Talmud unequivocably rejected his claims to messiahhood."
3,Over-focussed on Atwood's poetry,"Despite the author's tedious insistence that this is a ""not biography"" (when it obviously is a biography), the first half of this book is quite wonderful: a chance to meet the child who grew into the brilliant, steely writer, including some lovely, hilarious anecdotes that shed considerable light on her work.But, as the book proceeds, it becomes increasingly focussed on Atwood's poetry--page after page is devoted to excerpts and analysis--while her much more widely read novels, the primary reason she is of international interest, are covered with bizarre brevity. Though admittedly not Atwood's finest work, ""Lady Oracle,"" her first major bestseller and a book with obvious autobiographical significance, gets 3/4 of a page. Even Surfacing, a strenuously profound novel and surely worthy of eggheady analysis, gets short shrift.This imbalance undermines the book's value, and while The Red Shoes is a must for any serious Atwood fan, prepare to be frustrated."
5,Hawaii Beaches I,This disc provides beautiful pictures for a high definition big screen TV. The material is strictly image that is very tranquil and relaxing. It is directed toward the use in a professional office waiting room such as one provided by doctors or any other place where quiet beautiful pictures are desired. The pictures are of dream settings that could possibly set your mind to dreaming.
3,It's just ok,"This is a nice DVD, however, if you live in Florida or California or any other beach residency, save your money.First, there is no DVD menu, so if you decide you want to see a particular scene, you will be forwarding through the entire DVD to find it. You will also not be able to ""loop"" or play over and over the same scene if you want. The DVD is divided into the different islands of Hawaii (Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, etc) then you will see and hear different beach scenes (each lasting about 2-3 minutes) and goes through the entire day into sunset.I guess if you are a BIG fan of Hawaii, you might like this, other than that, I didn't find anything exciting or relaxing about it. I have seen other beach relaxation DVD's that focus on one beach scene and have more pristine beaches (Living Art-Endless Beach) and paid $10 rather than $25. However, I have not been able to find one in an widescreen HD or Blu-Ray mode."
4,The Millennium Bell,"The Millennium Bell being Oldfield's 1999 release and his 20th album is an album that deals with reflections of different periods of Human history. Tracks that stand out on this release are Santa Maria, Peace on Earth and Liberation. The booklet is really nice and informative. We get a short explantion for every track. We also get listed information on additonal singers and muisicians on the album. 4/5."
4,First a big disappointment ... - Later it grows on you!,"The only song that is worth a listening to is Lake Constance.This one really shines. The dodge's palace is also good, but when he repeats it at the end of the CD it becomes really boring...Good old Mike wanted to do some memorable work but it is rather silly. TB III is much better than this one. This album is as poor as Islands and Incantations were before.No Amarok, no TB II this time. Jump it....A few weeks passed and I'd listened to it several times. Yes! It simply grows on you! Mastermind is the weakest track, but it has several gems like Broad Sunlit Uplands.Give it some try! You'll love it!"
5,Dewalt DPG54-1C Protector Clear High Performance Lightweight,i love the Dewalt DPG54-1C Protector Clear High Performance Lightweight . They look great and feel great on your face
4,feel great but they fog up easily,The glasses are very comfortable and the vision is great but even without wearing a hat they still fog in the middle of winter.
3,misleading,"Wonder Pets is a great show, but the cover of the dvd is misleading. The cover shows the Wonder Pets saving the Beetles, assuming that was the video. The video contains three other episodes that is the approximate same amount of time as the episode saving the Beetles. It wasn't a full length movie of them saving the Beetles like I had thought."
2,There is only one saucer,"Even though the header says, ""saucers"", (plural) the purchase price is only for ONE saucer."
2,English subtitles need help,"A good look at Louis XIV's early reign, including daily activities and rituals, starting with the death of Mazarin. Very brief look at some of the issues of that time and Louis' relationship with key figures. Almost doesn't do the marvelous monarch justice. Unfortunately, the subtitles are horrible so a basic understanding of French is needed to understand certain sections."
3,Can't hear Barney on most tracks,"On most tracks you hear the children sing, but Barney is muffled. All in all it's still a Barney CD and has great songs. My toddler kept saying ""Barney?"", ""Barney?"" (the sound she makes when she wants me to put in a Barney CD) when most tracks played -- she is used to the newer albums where Barney is the out-front lead singer and the children are the backup. This album is the other way around (on most tracks)."
5,Fun songs for toddlers,"My 17 month old daughter just found out about Barney. I thought to buy her a cd to listen to in the car with Barney songs. We had other cd's which she enjoyed to listen to, however I thought she might like to hear Barney songs as well. I chose this particular Barney cd because it had MANY songs which she had heard before or are popular to sing to toddlers. After listening to it once in the car, it has become her favorite. She tries to sing along to many songs and as soon as the last song is almost done playing, she asks for it again. It is so cute to her ask for more Barney songs. So, I just replay the cd. She really enjoys it and I am very happy with my purchase."
5,*Premonitions* [10 STARS],"When I had read this book I was amazed of how thrilling and interesting the plot actually is. It's very intruiging. It kept me reading, and I was sad to see it come to an end. I was happy to hear that Jude Watson has a second book, which I am exciting about getting soon! If you love suspense, mystery or thillers-get this book!! I could read this book over and over and it'd never get old. Jude Watson puts the story together very well, and everything flows into each other. Also she doesn't leave any ""loose ends"" really either., which was nice. I truly think this is a FABULOUS book, please get it."
3,A Flawed But Entertaining Story!,"Gracie's a young teenager with psychic abilities. She has just lost her beloved mother in a car accident in Maryland and has relocated to live with her Aunt Shay and Cousin Diego in Berwick Island near Seattle, Washington in the Pacific Northwest.The novel is pretty easy reading for the most part and it's targeted to a young audience of readers. Gracie's psychic visions come in handy when her new friend Emily disappears. At first, the story progresses in a fast pace. The truth is a little-far fetched but I won't spoil it for any potential readers.Anyway, I thought the ending could have been better and the storyline could have been more believable. But it's entertaining even if it's fiction with a dash of psychic abilities. I do admire the author for trying to write as if being psychic isn't always a blessing and that psychics like Gracie don't have all the answers when they need too."
1,A really badly written mystery,"This is one of the badly written mystery. The plot is rather simple and the main characters are labelled ""good"" and ""bad"" in the very beginning, yet Dr. Freeman spared no pain to stretch a would-be short story to a novel with an ending which is so obvious in the very first few chapters. Besides, the incriminating thumb mark reminds everyone the Norwood builder of Holmes and the romance of the young doctor in no ways differs much from Dr. Watson's. It is really a waste of time for both the author and the readers."
3,"broad, hit-and-miss survey of the subject","Most programmers ask themselves, ""Why aren't my tools this easy to use?"" According to the contributors to this book, the answer is that we make far too little use of interactive 2D and 3D graphics. Even the most advanced integrated-development environments (IDEs) are built around a text editor. If you compare this to the dozens of sketches that programmers draw to show data structures, inheritance, and control flow, you can see how much more we could be doing. Most of the systems discussed in Software Visualization use visualization to examine or explain existing programs. Some of the results leave me cold, but some, like the classic ""Sorting Out Sorting"" by Baecker et al., are truly illuminating."
4,My first purchase through Amazon.com!,The product was exactly as desired.The purchase price was much better than expected.Delivery period exactly as expected.The purchased item worked exactly as desired.My initial impression of buying through Amazon.com was a pleasant experience!
4,"Not so wicked, but an incredible array of characters.","A good reintroduction to Dickens in this year, the bi-centenary of his birth - although the title is a misnomer - there is much more to Dickens and this book than 'wicked wit'. Provides a brief background on his fascinating and controversial life as well as many extracts from his books and correspondence. A quick read that whets the appetite to revisit this great author and social reformer. Dickens was the master of producing great character driven tales - and so many of those characters are now embedded in our culture - Scrooge, Fagan, Twist - this little book brings to the fore many of those strange and wonderful character's memorable moments. A refreshing insight into many of Dickens' lesser known characters as well."
3,Be careful what you buy...,"Buying replacement batteries can be a real challenge, especially for gizmos more than 10 years old. If you buy a slightly higher amp-hour capacity battery, that original charger *may* not be able to give it a full charge. Ask for details!! The ot her potential problem is that Ni-Cad batteries age rather quickly. We're already into JUNE of 2012, so if the manufacturing date code is not something in 2012, I would not buy it. Some folks are selling still selling '09 - '11 batteries as 'new.' Unused is probably a better term. A basic Makita 9100 battery for less than ~$35 is questionable and you ought to ask for more details. Buyer beware!!"
1,Wrong battery,The battery shown is not the battery for this item number. This battery does not have the side buttons needed for some drills including the 6226D.
5,Great rice cooker,Bought Zojirushi NHS-18 10-cup rice cooker a month ago. No complaints. Works like a charm if you follow the instructions.
4,"no mess, cooks rice really well","Since we eat rice practically everyday,I was looking for a rice cooker that would be easy to use, easy to clean and would cook rice in minutes.This cooker does it all, at the end of a tired day, my rice is ready within no time and the best part is that none of it sticks to the bottom of the cooker.I use my own water measure for each cup and I have had no problems and the rice turns out real nice n fluffy.Considering the price I bought it for, I would say its a super deal!"
2,Not as interesting as I thought,"I had thought that this would of been a decent quality docu-drama since it had the backing of the BBC. However, it was very dry and very similar to typical US Government productions of the same time period about nuclear war. Most of those are pretty dry as well and seem to have the same sort of production values. I understand the history behind this film, yet it doesn't seem to touch me in any way beyond wondering when it was going to end."
2,Boring infomercial,"Bad quality, b/w infomercial reminds me of a WW2 government infomercial. They didn't even bother showing (faking) a decent nuclear explosion. Perhaps it was banned because it would put people to sleep. Nothing even close to The Day After. I'd return it if I could."
3,"Another entry for the two same readings of Schubert's Trout by Paul Badura-Skoda, as ASIN B00000DDMS","This is obviously exactly the same release asIn The Mirror of Time Schubert ""Trout"" quintet, and I have no clue why it appears twice. It consists mainly of two recordings of Schubert's ""Trout"" quintet both sharing Paul Badura-Skoda as pianist - one made in the early days of mono LP for Westminster with the Wiener Konzerthaus Quartet, the other in 1997. See my comments under the other entry."
5,A good value.,"A little big for under my overcrowded sink, but sturdy and strong and big enough for all my cleaning products, rags ect. to fit in."
4,Eats shoots and translates,"You are best off buying the old Magarshack translation, published by Penguin Classics.The new Pearl translation contains so many unnecessary typographical errors--comma disease, carriage returns that insert white lines in the middle of paragraphs more than once, quotation marks regularly lost track of--that the edition is too broken to use with pleasure.Stylistically Pearl's done something different from Magarshack, ""updating"" the old-feeling language. This sometimes works well in dialogues between characters, but not so much in the voice of the narrator, in my opinion."
5,More Things that Go Bump In the Night In Chicago,"Author Ursula Bieslski provides an excellent sequel to her first book of ghostly tales. Told through historical facts and by eye witness accounts, this book is worthy follow-up. Highly Recommended! Perfect for Halloween or any ghost-hunting time of the year."
4,Great product,This product works right out of the box. The mounting scheme is great. I hung mine from the ceiling using S hooks. The remote control is absolutely necessary and works well. It would be nice if the unit had some sort of gauge to know when to change the filters.All seven of the major machines in my shop are hooked up to a dust collection system yet despite that I can see dust forming on the filter after two or three days use. Based on this simple observation it is clear to me that air filtration is a must for any wood worker. It should be one of the first purchases when building a shop.I can breath again!
4,Good for the money,It works but I still have dust all over the garage. Good product for the money but don't count on it removing everything.
4,Great air mover with low overhead,"This is a great air cleaner that moves air and filters well. the only draw back I had was that I have a small to mid size basement workshop with a 7 1/2 foot ceiling. I was going to mount this on the ceiling but would have only have had a 5 foot clearance so my next location was on the wall. So after 5 hours of rearanging some tools and taking down peg board and relocating storage I was able to place the unit at an optimum height and location. After all is said and done, great machine but if you are starting a workshop, buy this first so you can plan ahead!"
4,Great performance,"This unit is all it is advertised to be. Works really well in my 24 x 30 shop. Case was alittle out of square, which required some foam insulating tape, but with that done it works just fine. There were some comments regarding the high noise level at high speed but I did not notice that at all. You wont be disappointed."
5,Save your lungs .. Excellent air filteration,"Well, This was way bigger than I had expected , so when It arrived I had find a place in garage as my garage is only 7-8 feet tall. Since it is bulky but not heavy, I decided to hang it to ceiling with chain.Unit was damaged when I opened the box and thought of not returning and waiting to get another one as it was not worth the time.I cut lot of fine with 80 teeth blade and that creates lot of dust. Also it really helped me while sanding with belt sander.I loved the remote and also timer feature. I think this is great product and if you want to save your lungs, get this one.I used to cough after doing 1-2 hours of woodworking but since I installed it, I don't anymore. Thanks to Jet !!..I guess shipping would have better since unit was damaged on 2 sides.Overall, excellent buy but make sure you know the size of this unit before you buy ..."
5,I love this thing!,"The unit arrived in about a week in good condition. Fit and finish excellent. The remote is great! It works from anywhere in my shop. (My shop has white walls and ceiling). The unit is quiet running (compared to the vac and tool noises). In my 15 X 25 X 8 ft. shop, the air clear and dust free after intensive routing, sawing or planing.I would like to see mounting eyebolts for ceiling mounting in the vertical position.I love this thing and I recommend it to any small shop operator"
4,Good System,Air cleaner works very good in my garage where I do wood projects and also store a classic car. Only problem is the plactic handle broke and the unit fell 3 feet to the floor. The unit was not damaged and I will replace the handle with a metal one.
4,Money well spent,"An air filter should never be used in lieu of a dust collector but if youre like me and workin a garage with a combination of bench top tools and handheld power tools you know you can't ever get it all with a collector. I've heard pros and cons on filters but I wish I had bought one of these sooner. The Jet 1000 is Very quiet, has multiple mounting options (I put mine up against a window on my 4x8 workbench and use it like an exhaust fan to keep the output from blowing whatever dust is in the air back around) and the timer is a great idea. Would consider moving it inside for messy jobs too (it's quiet enough). Don't go without a good dust collector but in combo with this filter you've made a good investment in your health and enjoyment of your shop"
2,Beware of fan wobble,"Out of the box, it looked great... until I plugged it in that is. I'm sure this product works great when you get one that isn't assembled with a bent motor mount. When I plugged it in, the fan started wobbling. It was rubbing against the metal frame as it started to spin. I thought it was going to fly apart as it started speeding up. I unplugged it and found that the motor mount inside was bent so that it was mounted at an angle. I called WMH support and they tried to ask me if I wanted them to send a new fan part. First of all, I don't need just the fan blade when it is the motor mount that it broken. Second, I'm not about to try to take this apart and fix it when I just got it. You would think that they would send a new replacement, but that hasn't happened yet. Just cross your fingers that your's doesn't come with the same type of problem."
2,poor reliability,"This thing does the job when it works. After 2 weeks in the shop after light use, the timer stopped working. They mailed me a new board which took about 30 minutes to replace and still the timer does not work. So I have had the thing about six weeks and it only functioned properly for 2 weeks. I am waiting their next move. I give them one more chance and if it still isn't repaired then it goes back and I demand a refund. This is not a complicated unit. Why cant they get it right?"
1,AFS-1000B has a timer defect,"I purchased the AFS-1000B, tested out the unit, seemed fine. Went into my shop the next day and it was running even though I had turned it off. Turns out, if you set the timer and then change your mind and turn it off, it will turn itself on a couple of hours later and run until you stop it. Could be days! Jet sent me a new board, I installed it, same thing. So I returned it for another AFS-1000B. Same thing happens. This one is going back in the box and being returned and I'm now shopping for a unit that works properly and isn't possessed.Contact Jet before you buy to see if this has been corrected. Could be a good tool.Jet's reply from tech support on 2/28/08:Thank you for writing. There is a solution in the works, but I don't know what it's going to be. I'll let you know as soon as I have an answer.Aundrea BerkeyInternet Customer SupportWMH Tool GroupMakers of POWERMATIC, JET, and WILTON products"
5,Perfect for Young Guitar Players!,"My seven year old son began playing the guitar last year and has a 1/2 size instrument. Strings have been replaced somewhat often. However, these strings have a wonderful sound. ""I love these new strings,"" exclaimed my young guitarist. Martin Silk and Steel, Light are the correct combination for boy's fingers!!"
4,My Third Pack,"This is my third pack; the 1st pack has been using for two months, the sounds are rich and full, and the feels are still good. I broke the high E on the 1st attempt of restringing, and luckily I had bought 2 packs at the same time. So, I want to keep a completed pack for back up. I have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently, sometime, i will practice for 4-5 hours+ until i'm tired for the session. I have used light steel strings on my acoustic, but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter."
2,"Okay, depending on your purpose","The vinyl is sturdy and the zipper is flimsy as noted by another reviewer. I purchased a few of these bags; one of the zippers ripped away from the vinyl and another one broke at the handle because I put heavier items in it. If all you want to do is store sleeping bags/lightweight linen as pictured and you have the patience to be careful with the zipper, these will work fine. If not, then try a different product."
4,Good companion to a class.,I am taking a Dear Jane Quilt Class. This book was required. The book is a great companion to the class. The book has quilt block patterns but no insturctions. If you have some quilting and applique skills you will be able to figure it out. I have found that I am additcted to making this quilt even if I only finish enough to be a wall hanging.
4,Dear Jane: the Two Hundred Twenty-five Patterns from the 1863 Jane A. Stickle Quilt,We ordered the book but despite the need of sending abroad it arrived before the scheduled date. Then we mananged to have a good use of the book.
5,perfect,"good quality, durable and easy to use, the clic-change setup is much faster than the traditional typeI wish they have the longer bits in a kitbottom line: I would buy it again because I hate cheap bits that you have to replace all the time, yes you can get a kit for less than half the price, this will last 4 times longer and won't fail you in the middle of a job"
5,Great basic 1/4 hex set,"This is a nice basic assortment of bits & tools that fits impacts with 1/4"" hex bits. This tool comes with a nice compact case that easily fits in most tool bags. The only thing I can see improvement is the way the case opens and closes, a little slow a clunky, has a cheap Chinese tool case feeling. Other then the bits and tools that come in this kit will cover 95% of the fasteners you might find in a service environment. Note the quick change drill adapter DOES NOT fit in 1/4"" hex drivers, nor is it designed for it. It's meant to convert a normal drill into a 1/4"" hex driver to use these bits. This is a great companion for the Bosch ps20 or ps40."
4,Nice small package,Just a little better than the the others out there and the price is great. Nicely put together and does what you need to do. Fits well with the other small stuff and when packaged with thier small drill/driver you get your work done.
2,written in,When I bought it I thought it was new. It was used and written in. I won't buy from them again.
3,"Great, but...","I've had this rice cooker for years, and everything we cook in it (white and brown rice, and steel-cut oatmeal) turn out great every time. So why three stars?First, the manual recommends you not leave it plugged in when it's not in use. But when the battery that powers the clock dies, you'll find out it's not user replaceable. Not a big deal since you can live without the clock or ignore the manual and leave it plugged in.But now the rubber part of the steam vent has gone missing, and it turns out Zojirushi no longer makes the steam vent, so it cannot be replaced. We haven't tried using the cooker without it, and it might work, but in general I suspect this model has already been discontinued by the manufacturer, so I strongly recommend choosing a newer model (or another brand)."
3,Video Ok,"I thought the video was average. I wished they had spent more time on Iceland and less on Greenland (more visit Iceland by far). I did like Ian the host. Now after visiting Iceland on two ocassions (planning a 3rd trip next year) I realize there is so much more to do in the country then what they presented in the video....but worth it for those who might be on the fence trying to decide whether or not to visit the country. BTW, its worth the trip, what a fantastic country!!"
5,Replacement for my old Zojirushi rice cooker,"This is the same rice cooker that is replacing my old one that lasted 11 yrs before the inside teflon coating started peeling. Its great for making 1 cup of rice and the rice is perfect every time. Use the right amount of water per cup of rice, otherwise the water will squirt from the tiny hole in the glass lid. (I.E. 1 3/4 Cups of water per cup of rice for long grain rice)."
1,Total waste of money,"Makes a mess in my kitchen every time I use it. The little hole in the top causes a hot spray of watery rice fluid to shoot out and everywhere. Didn't last very long either, the nonstick coating started to bubble up, while it was still usable, half the rice I cooked stuck pretty badly to the bottom. If you were only ever to use it to steam veggies, it may work better, as I didn't steam much with it. But as a rice cooker alone I hate this product."
1,"Zojirushi NHS-10 6-Cup Rice Cooker/Steamer & Warmer, White","This is the worst rice cooker i have ever owned, and i have owned many. You are unable to see the graduations on the inside pot, and have to use a flashlight or guess at the correct measurement of water. Even worse, i had purchased there other model, Zojirushi NP-GBC05 3-Cup Rice Cooker and while you can read the graduations, it is a joke. Having said that when i phoned Customer Complaint (another joke) 1 800 733 6270, their answer was that that inner pot does not come with internal graduations painted therefore they could not do anything about this. Joe"
1,fails out of the box,"I filled it up with the proper amounts of water and rice as directed. I plugged it in and depressed the lever so the ""cooking"" light came on. Within seconds, that lever popped up and then the ""keep warm"" light came on instead and the lever did not return. If I depress the lever again so the ""cooking"" light comes back on, within seconds that lever pops back up again and the ""keep warm"" light comes on. I thought maybe this is some sort of safety feature like you have with some electric heaters where it shuts off if it gets too hot but when it cools down acceptably, they cycle back on again. Of course, I thought it odd that sufficient heat would build up to shut it off so fast. Anyway, no matter how long (over half an hour) I leave it plugged in, once that lever pops up, neither the lever ever goes back down nor does the ""cooking"" light ever come back on again. Nor does the rice cook. Water stays lukewarm."
3,"very nice,...but...","The rice first time was nearly perfect, but found several light browish clumps of rice, what causes them?? I did stir at least twice during cooking time. I also want to know why the rice must be washed first, I did wash it but why?? This extra step is alot more , and it is messy ,and makes the cooker less attractive. I will use again, but could use some tips from someone who knows more about these machines. The keep warm part is a plus."
2,Terrible rice cooker,"If you want to cook just one cup of rice, this is not the rice cooker. The rice becomes too dry on the bottom.Also, the magnetic cord gets loose easily. It's really frustrating."
3,"Cooks rice fine, but NO power button!!","I bought this as a replacement to my old Hitachi rice cooker. The NHS-10 does a fine job at cooking rice. I've had soft, sticky rice with no burning issues since using this rice cooker. I do have 1 big issue with it though. THERE IS NO POWER BUTTON? Why on earth would any appliance maker make anything without a power button? I find it quite annoying to have to plug and unplug this thing each time I want to use it.It's my fault for not looking for a power button prior to purchasing, but come on, it's 2009 and they couldn't add it in (especially for it's price???).If I had to do it all over again, I would not buy this product specifically for that reason. No quality issues, just a serious design flaw."
5,excellent cooker,"I am very happy with my rice cooker.It works well, cooks rice, oatmeal and steams vegetables.This is just what I was looking for."
4,Careful with the rice:water ratio,"Glad I read the reviews above, but not till it was too late! The owners' manual says use one rice-cup of brown rice and 200 ml water. Brown rice takes about 3x the water.I do like this machine!"
1,I hate this rice cooker,"I am ready to throw this rice cooker in the garbage. It has a small hole in the lid, and spews ricey, white liquid all over the counter when cooking. So much water is lost through this stupid hole, that the rice is never cooked properly. I must have a defective one, if anyone can rate this higher than a 0 star. I had an old rice cooker that lasted for decades, and worked just fine. Wish I could remember the brand!"
3,Excellent Rice Cooker with a BIG Problem,"The none stick jacket peels itself off after some time. So, I cut two stars off for poor none stick coating."
4,"Works well, pan losing nonstick coating","The cooker performs as advertised, but does ""spit"" all over the counter, as others have said. The lid gets nice and clean in the dishwasher. My main quibble is that the nonstick coating on the pan, which we wash only by hand, is already coming off. The cooker is about 2 years old and used 2-3x/month. When the coating is gone, will we have to get a new rice cooker?"
3,"Makes good rice, but splatters on the counter","We read the reviews pro and con, and were concerned about the reports of sputtering on the counter, but decided to give it a try since most of the reviews were positive and some stated specifically they had not had this problem. Well, we should have listened to the warnings. For the first 2-3 months, the cooker was fine, with no splatter. Then, for no apparent reason, it began to splatter nearly every time we used it. We have no idea why this happens, as we have not changed the type of rice (even the brand is the same), the amount of water, or anything else. Totally bizarre (not to say annoying). We have ""solved"" the problem by placing a small piece of aluminum foil over the handle on the cover, so that part of it extends over the ""blow hole."""
5,Buy it!,"Excellent for the single guy or couple. A bag of potatoes goes bad pretty fast, rice keeps for a long, long time. Add the rice and water, turn it on, and the machine pretty much does the rest of the work. Perfect every time.I would buy this machine without hesitation. I have been using it a couple of times a week for about 8 years and wouldn't be without it."
1,Messy!,"This rice cooker makes a huge mess spraying hot rice water all over the counter. We can not seem to find the right method to stop this mess. We are now putting the thing into the sink but it still sprays over the counter, steams up the window and we are not recommending this item to anyone."
5,Zojirushi rice cooker/steamer,"makes everything from rice and porridge to steamed vegetables,easy to clean, no more burnt pots, I use it everyday, worth the investment, but if you want to slow cook a stew or soup, better get a slow cooker. The rice cooker will boil the liquid out of your recipe too fast."
5,Best ever!,I bought a pair of these in '06. They are perfect boots--just right. I want more. I hope ULU starts making them again.
4,great introduction to Edith Piaf's music,"This 2-CD set was my first Edith Piaf release that I ever purchased, and although I only had heard ""La Vie en Rose"" up to that point, I quickly became a follower of her music. I agree a bit with some of the reviews where they complain about the lack of information in the 2-page booklet. Since this was a 30th anniversary celebration, maybe a nicer booklet would have been included. But keep in mind that this 2-CD set is kind of a ""sampler"" of the 10-CD Set. So, I guess they saved the booklet for the big set. In any case, all tracks in this collection are great. I was not that thrilled with the 2 ""inedit"" bonus tracks because the sound was bad, and maybe other tracks (live, or alternate versions) would have been included. After listening to newer compilations, CD-sets and such, I realized that some tracks/versions remain exclusive to this 2-CD set and the 10-CD set, so either collection is a must for the collectors that already own the recent releases."
3,not as good as i thought it would be,"I am going to be the only dissenter here. The choice of songs is excellent, and this is why i bought the CD.However, I think that several of the selected songs must be early versions which were then fine tuned by E. Piaf over the years. I have listened to other CDs and vinyl record where renditions such as Jezebel, and La Foule where much more forceful and on a higher emotional level.A good choice for people who have not heard the later versions of the songs, or those prefer to hear the earlier versions,"
4,MP3 Downloads,"Downloaded are only available for contries near USA. Why?? It's an MP3, I don't need shipping! And it's worst.. I can download the Amazon downloader, wasting time with this task and finally you cancel the urchase beacuse it's not available.Tell me this BEFORE: It's a usability principle!"
5,Matthew Hit the Nail on the Head,"Matthew hit the nail on the head when he wrote:""This two CD set is highly recommended for Piaf fans (as if they didn't know that already), fans of French classic vocals and fans of international music. Thank goodness Edith Piaf shared her talents with us while she lived amongst us--fans of the arts are infinitely better off because of Piaf's substantial contributions to the arts.""The Piaf legend will live forever and should. I, too, recommend the Carnegie two-cd set. It's enthralling from start to end.Piaf, Garland and Minnelli...the world will never see women performers like these again.Great reveiw, Matthew!"
5,"brillant movie, brillant CD!","if you have seen the movie ""good will hunting"", you may be touched by the sincere work of Matt and Ben, the co-authors of the screenplay who have spend 5 years to finish it. it beated other competitor to win the best original screenplay, and there was great! i am not gonna to write an essay to comment the movie. but if you like this movie, you cannot miss out the original soundtrack (as well as the book!) The lyrics of the song is closely and directly related to the movie content. EG. in the song ANGELES, it has ""To see Will, sign up the faithful angeles"" it especially make people can feel the good will hunting mood! if you have cry for the movie, you will probably cry for the song!it is the only album which have ever break up my heart!"
3,Very solid album,An admirable job of conveying the emotions of the main characters. The soundtrack can stand alone as well and is very relaxing.
1,Poor production,"I ordered this DVD expecting to enjoy a good documentary. When I received then unit, I found the DVD scratched beyond use. The DVD had popped off of the retainer within the DVD case. Went through Amazon and requested a replacement unit. When it arrived, it too was scratched beyond use.....same problem. The original manufacturer used a clearly inferior case to sell this product. Returned both and requested refund. Amazon did great by refunding in a timely manner."
2,Ring,"I ordered this ring in a size 8. When I received my order, the order size was crossed off and a size 7 inserted. (ASIN:B000F19QZE 3/8"" (10 mm) Sterling Silver Hand Made Ring with Musical Note]] If I wanted a size 7, I would have specified it, but it would have been too small. I sent it back, because it was too small."
3,"Close, but not perfect translations","If I had every quarter I pumped into the original arcade games all those years ago...well, nevermind. What I mean to say is, I know these games backward and forward. And although these are decent translations, they are far from perfect. The main problem is the sound. The casual gamer probably won't be bothered by this, but to the arcade gaming purist, it matters.Still, this new and very affordable format holds promise. Let's hope future endeavors spend a little more time to get it right.Recommended for players looking for a nostalgia fix, but serious enthusiasts will likely be a bit disappointed."
4,This toy rocks!!!!,"Now I'm playing this more than PS2!The games that I like the most are PacMan, DidDug, and Rally X.If you want to take a blast to the past, than you will want to get this toy. Like I said, This toy rocks!!!"
5,GREAT FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!!!!,"This toy is everything in one. Fun, entertaining, easy for you to bring it along everywhere!!! Plus it is a blast from the past. One day my child went to his friends house and the other child showed it to him, and he immediatly sort of frowned (he didn't think they would be fun) he sat down and started to play. I came back 4 hours later and they were still playing. It may seem awful how you have to sort of pass it along to the next person but it is sharing, it is teaching your child to share and to wait his or hers turn so in total I give it straight 5s and I think everybody should try it out at least once .It has always made me laugh how trends like these come and go, and these games are one of those trends."
3,Fun but dont be fooled!,"I was looking forward to this for a long time, these games are still great time killers and very addictive, however if youre a true namco fan you will be upst to know that the original sound effects that made these games so famous are not true reproductions. the box says Namco but if you read the fine print on the package they are not offical licensed games. But if you dont care about Authentic sound effects and dont mind generic blips you will enjoy this product."
3,Plug and play,"well the unit was replaced, however the replacement looked beat up but does work. thanks I hope it will last."
3,Okay,"The packaging was okay, but the condition wasn't the best. I ordered two. One of the two had batteries that were corroded. It had to be cleaned, but it did work after cleaning. The other had loose battery contact area and required aluminum foil to make contacts before working. They were both not as described. I didn't expect to have to clean and fix before making them work especially since they were gifts for Christmas."
3,Nostalgia vs. Carpal Tunnel,"The sound effects on Dig Dug alone make the game worth playing, but the mini arcade shaped box is unwieldy.Your hands cramp very easily and it's impossible to play Rally X for very long without hitting the reset button by accident.There should be a ""lock"" switch to prevent hitting the reset button accidentally and the gizmo should have suction cups and a weighted base so you can play without clutching this square-cornered box with both hands until your hands end up looking like the curled up feet of a dead bird.I never played Rally X in the arcade, but the reset button not-withstanding, that game is freakin' impossible! Dig Dug & Pac Man will be the long standing favorites, but due to hand-cramping, you simply can't play that long and there is no pause button!"
3,fitty bucks - not bad,This thing is fine if you want it for a kitchen or bedroom. Light weight and small makes it good for camping or BBQ's. Sound is pretty tinny especially at higher volumes. Not recommended for large rooms or for your only sound system.
1,DO NOT BUY,Don't Buy this... The Hissing from the speakers is terrible. I only had it on for 2 minutes...WASTE OF MONEY!! There are 20 Dollar units that sound better than this one!!
1,"Great Clock Radio, Horrible Ipod Player",The speakers inside are not shielded against the output of the ipod so as soon as you plug an ipod in you hear a high pitched squeal. After getting fooled by this one I bought the iHome model and have been very happy with it. DON'T BUY THIS RADIO!!
5,12V Makita replacemtent batteries,They work very well and were reasonably priced. What was key to my purchase was the fact that they were from Makita and not aftermarket knock-offs batteries.
4,Relaxing Trans,The album is pretty good if you like ambient music. It's Trans and I find it quite relaxing. If you ever purchased any of McCartney's classical music records you are used to the idea of listening to something that doesn't have anything to do with his Beatles/Wings/solo career.
4,Great 3-cup Cooker,"Being Filipina, I've been through MANY rice cookers and found it difficult to find the perfect one for a household that no longer needs to make 4-8 cups of rice on a daily basis. Yes, there are better rice cookers that have cords that retract, lids that snap shut, are made to insulate, and play digital tunes when the rice is done. They are ALSO close to $100. I'm cool with the old school ""ding"" for $30. The size saves space on the counter top, it's easy to clean, and the rice comes out just right every time. I have also found my Zojirushi water boiler to be a trustworthy product."
5,Just the right size for our needs,"Freshly cooked rice each meal, I just wished that the cord's retractable like our Zujirushi 10-cup rice cooker. Recommended for smaller family who loves to eat rice."
5,Best ever when cooking for one...,"I have had one of these little cookers for over five years.It get used a coupla times a week. I've never had it botch a batch of rice.True, it doesn't have a lot of features, but that's just stuff not to go wrong.It cooks one measure of rice of rice is less than 22 minutes, perfect when cooking for one.Keeps rice warm for up to a half hour easily, to turn it off, just briefly lift the pan.I've never had it spit out the vent hole, but then I have the larger model when cooking more than one measure. I also wash the rice before cookingRice Washing Bowl with Side and Bottom Drainers, apparently few people do (I blame Uncle Ben).Of all the gadgets I own this one has given me the least problems, amazing when I use it so much."
4,Good product!,I love these! Every size I need I also used them for my cakepops and cupcakes! I washed them and they didn't rust! Yay!
5,star spangle banner version of a lady who went before her time,this version of the star spangled banner is the best modern version of a patriotic song that lifted the nation and united a nation in time of war and I will never forget that it was the hight of her popularity
5,Absolutely the best!,"A friend of mine got the Zojirushi rice cooker and highly recommended it to me. I bought one and LOVE it! It makes rice perfectly every time and is extremely easy to use. You can set it to cook the rice to be ready exactly when you want it to, it's easy to clean (I love anything that can go in the dishwasher!) and easy to store. I've since bought another one for another friend for Christmas, I would highly recommend this rice cooker to anyone. None of the others come close in quality!"
2,zojirushi ns-jcc18 nero fuzzy rice cooker,the instructions are awful.therefore i have not been able to use this machine as intended. if any one knows where instructions are located that u.s. english speaking people can use that would be helpful.
4,Soo Cool,"Whether a kid or adult, quite fun to fiddle with, does lose its appeal after a week, but put down and revisit every couple of months for a renewed chuckle. great for on a desk or coffee table. Batteries also last an amazingly long time, didn't need changing until after a year. can be addicting, you want to get more and more cubes to connect and see what they do. fun!"
4,works great for fruit,I bought it for fruit and it works well. The fruit actually look like flower petals...clean and precise. I recommend it for this purpose.
4,Sweet story of childhood love,"""Clouds"" is the republished fifth book of Robin Jones Gunn's Glenbrooke series. The story revolves around Jonathan Renfield and Shelly Graham-kids who grew up together and eventually fell in love. But due to harsh words, the two break ties. The book picks up five years later as Shelly moves home and memories of Jonathan overwhelm her as she wonders where life has taken him.The story is an enjoyable romance filled with travel and sisterhood. I enjoyed the story Robin weaves. Part of me wonders if this is one of her first books published, as it isn't as fluid as some other books I've read of her such as the Christy Miller series. I was sad that the book had such an abrupt ending. Hopefully we'll see more of Jonathan and Shelly in the remainder of the Glenbrooke series, because they have a sweet story.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
4,A reminder of what relationship is truly important,"Jonathan and Shelly were best friends growing up. As so often does, time broke them apart. Now they have a second chance, or at least that is how it seems. Unfortunately, a previous engagement stands in the way of a reuinion of their friendship and love.I enjoyed this book. It makes a statement that I think is so important. So frequently, women think that once they get married they will be happy. Or their life will come together in marriage...SO not TRUE!Robin Jones Gunn uses Shelly to explain the truth that a relationship with Christ should come before any other relationship. It is only when Shelly deepens her relationship with the Creator of the Universe that she finds out how to be truly content, with or without Jonathan.A great read and a great reminder of what is truly important in life.I received this book in exchange for my honest review"
2,"America from the Air by Robert J. Moore, Jr.",There is an error on top of page 43 -- no such mountain as Mt. Cook in Alaska. Picture does somewhat resemble Augustine Island in Lower Cook Inlet however. The picture was credited to Galen Rowell/Mountain Light.
5,excellent condition.,I was really satisfied with this book. It has excellent condition withamazing price.
4,Much longer life spand than the so called improve nickle metal,Please dont wast time withe new makita batteries until they improve the life spend
5,Fold and Cut Stories,This is a must for creative reading to preschoolers and 1st graders. It is an immediate spellbinder for the children. The 2 activities together is such a magical thing for the children. I would definitely recommend this at home or in the classroom.
5,Great Little known story!,Intriguing story about an everyday woman who was considered not worthy to be mentioned because of her occupation. But her name is infamous because of this read.
3,"Great Poster, Poor Clarity","I love Prefontaine. Saw the photo on Amazon and it looked just like a paper poster (must have been). Pretty disappointed with the visual clarity and quality of the Cloth Poster. I have never owned one before, nor have I seen them anywhere else other than Pre posters. Still like the poster, but expected much more based on the picture."
1,Item is not in stock,"I ordered this item very early on a Monday morning and did not hear from Very Asia until Thursday. They do not have this item anymore. Very Asia offered to send me a different model, but did not offer to upgrade the shipping to make up for this delay. They did emphasize that I would be credited for the price differential (the replacement is cheaper) but that is to be expected, I would think, if the original purchase cannot be honored. I would not have ordered this product if it were acurately depicted as ""not available""."
5,Zojirushi NS-KCC05 Mocom Rice Cooker,This rice cooker makes rice (and other grains such as millet) flawlessly and easily. You can also use the timer function to have your meal ready when you get home from being away.
1,You will want to take a pass on this one,"Might as well draw a sailboatVery flimsy, bought it for my 6 year old boy for Christmas, thew it out with the trashVery thin wood, I would call it paper actuallyTake a pass, get something you could use and your kid will enjoy"
1,"boring, pointless, a total waste of time","What on earth was the point of that? Cardboard characters mouthing turgid expositions of the state of the world. Plodding style showing utter ignorance of how commas are used. Stuff happens, and then more stuff happens, and then some more; plot points are portentously introduced and then abandoned; then suddenly nothing happens any more because the book is over. What happened to the traitor? What happened to Ferrara's book? What happened to Liberazione? What happened to Emil, and why did the cops pounce at the end? What was Christa doing in Berlin in the first place? What were the consequences of the murder at the beginning? Who the heck cares any more? Dreadful."
2,Not the old Furst I once knew...,"I bought this book after seeing a review in USA Today (perhaps, I should have actually read the review--my bad). One of the best comic novels I ever read was by Furst many years ago, hence I thought this book might be entertaining. In actuality, it is plodding and dull, with a protagonist who is neither engaging nor particularly interesting. There may be a story involved but it's not particularly apparent in the first half or so. Most books of this length I'd have digested in a sitting or two; this one has taken what seems like forever and I'm not sure I'll ever finish it, unless something starts to happen pretty soon. Very disappointing!"
3,Okay but,"Like several other readers, I was less than impressed by this effort. I don't know if Furst has run out of gas or it is the theme, it is getting a little stale. For me, it is a long way away from the atmosphere of ""The World at Night."""
3,"Not bad, but where was his EDITOR?","The guy is in LOVE with commas! Not, you know, just the occasional, sprinkled, judiciously, here, and there, but everywhere! At first I thought it was just a stylistic quirk, but it gets really annoying before long. I noticed some typos, too.Beyond that, a pretty good WWII spy drama."
4,A good read,"Alan Furst came to my attention through a New York Times Book Review about his newest book. After a little bit of research, mostly here on Amazon people's lists, I bought ""Night Soldiers"" and loved it so much that I immediately bought ""The Foreign Correspondent"" and enjoyed it almost as much. I now have ""Dark Star"" waiting for me to start on a flight I'm taking on Wednesday.These are great books of an era as well as a travelogue of European countries I love already and some to which I've never been but definitely will visit now. Oh, also, be careful. You'll want to take up smoking and sit alone in dark areas. Be strong."
5,Dance to the Music of Time,All Furst's alluring skills are on offer here.Returning to pre-war Paris his palette rich portraits of people and places rise off the page. Each new novel is revealed as part of a larger mosaic. Together they are forming a Dance to the Music of Time. Revealing an era through a series of side long glances. You read for the pleasures on each page. At ease with an author consumately in command of his craft.Furst lives and breathes the old adage...the less that is more.
1,a novelette,"I have read all of Furst's books numerous times, but this one is a real disappointment. It is more of a sketch of a story than a story. In all of his war novels, the characters drift realistically through love, hunger, and housing problems while doing their part in fighting against totalitarianism. The difference in this book is that drifting dominates while any effort at plot development or the building of suspense is completely abandoned. I'll wait for the next one to come out in paper."
5,Absolutely necessary,"You must own this album if only for ""Almost with You"", but the whole album is of the quality you'd expect from The Church. A bit more acoustic than the rest of their early albums but doesn't lack in the melodic charm they are adept at. ""A Fire Burns"" is a great rocker, too."
1,Be careful with this one,Do not confuse this single tape with the 4 tape box set put out by Visual Bible. It is not the same thing.
1,missing disc one,"when the DVD arrived I opened it in great anticipation of watching it right away. unfortunately I cannot.. as it is a two disc DVD set and disc one is MISSING. only disc two arrived???? the package was sealed, so now I cannot return this purchase. I am very dissapointed."
1,"""High tension""... ha!!","I bought these for my wonderful Yamaha FG700s. I play every day and was hoping to give some rest to my fingers and try the softer tone of nylon strings.I was happy to have found nylon strings that, according to the description, could be used in acoustic guitars for steel strings (hey! they even come with ball ends!). I was hopeful that these ""high tension"" would work well but either way decided to be EXTREMELY careful when tuning the strings. I was almost successful, until the E string snapped (of course had to be that one!). Complete frustration and complete waste of money! Back to my reliable steel strings.Please do not waste your money and time."
5,super great teaching book...the one I used the MOST!,Hey....just the best book I found on making all sorts of jewelry out of hemp. The knots are easy to learn and the sample pictures give lots of suggestions for variety. I have gotten many compliments on my necklaces...the slide loop clasp is absolutely the greatest way to start a piece. It looks good and is a real pleaser when you give it to someone as a gift. I can't say enough as to how many neat things I learned from this book...I really dig this funky book!
5,Amazon needs to put original release dates,I really wish Amazon would include original release date info instead of just providing issue reprint dates. Come on guys!!!!
5,mommy of two Boy's,This jogger ROCKS!!! I have a 18 month (26lbs) old and seven year old (40lbs) I wanted something I could have them both ride in. I walk about two miles a day. This jogger is light weight and easy to push. We are looking forward to taking it to Disneyworld this summer. I love how it can fold flat (wheels off) and it is so much easier to fold than our super jogger thats 8yrs old. (still going strong) I highly recommend this jogger to anyone that wants quality over a cheaper jogger. Remeber you get what you pay for.
2,"A Let Down After "" A Place In The Sun ""","I know I'm in the minority here, but I found this album to be uninspired and disappointing compared to their album "" A Place In The Sun "". The musicianship is fine but the material is mostly lame . Whereas 'Sun' contains at least three songs worthy of release as singles , 'World' only has "" Love Will Find A Way "" . Don't expect a song by song review by me because I only listened to it once in the summer of 1978 . The best memory I have of it is how I wished I could have returned it for my money back . I'll very charitably give it two stars . "" A Place In The Sun "", an album by Pablo Cruise that I very much like, beats it hands down ."
1,Think twice on this one. HORIBLE Qualty.,"I read the reviews before purchasing. What a mistake.No lie. This is the worse quality movie I have ever seen. Regarding picture taking.This movie is worst then my home made movies that I transferred from 8mm to VCR.The quality is VERY Horrible. You can't seen lots of the film. I'm Shocked that Amazon aloud this to happen!If Amazon cared about their customers they would pull this off the shelf. I'm only talking about the quality of the movie.HORRIBLE. Because of this. I will NEVER buy a Movie from Amazon. NEVER Again. I'm Sorry, But this Movie should never been sold."
4,Neil Jordan's sleeper is a winner,"Beautiful cinematography and a haunting musical score highlight this early Neil Jordan reworking of ""Little Red Riding Hood"". Some people think it's too slow, but I never have. It's a rainy afternoon type of movie, the kind you watch on the couch when you don't feel well, with a blanket over you and a bowl of soup on the coffee table. It's not a horror movie so much as a series of eerie folk tales as told by Granny (Angela Lansbury) to her granddaughter. The running joke is that all the stories are indirect warnings about men and sex, meant to keep the little girl chaste and virginal! She of course discovers her own womanhood inspite of granny, and ends up in the arms of the big bad wolf! Don't expect horror, this isn't ""The Howling"" or ""American Werewolf"". It's a mood piece."
3,Overpriced,Could have done without the 2 stories featuring Jingles the magic elf that adults cannot see (approx. 17 out of 90 pages).
3,"It's more ""thesis"" than book","I read and reread this and I never could make myself like it. It's pretty bad. But for those not wanting to know that much about the human Antoinette and more interested in her in the metaphysical sense, this is the book for you. It's crap to me right now. But who knows....I might find gold in it a decade down the road. Maybe there's insight I've yet to understand. Hence, I'm not placing it in a garage sale...for now."
1,very disappointed,I regret I did not read these reviews before I bought this book.The digressions were very distracting. I was greatly offended by thevulgar language of the phamplets. I had to throw the book out to prevent any one else being offended. At the time I bought this book I bought another that was more informative.
2,Very Marginal,"I am not impressed by this fan - it seems impossible to find a well made oscillating table fan these days. Most of the fans are the tower type fan and I have been looking for months to find a ""old fashion"" well made table fan and I thought this was it... I was wrong. As it rotates, it gets to one side and kind of flops over - I'm sure this is simply a defect in my particular fan but it does high-light how poorly it is made. It has little power and the components are poorly made. I am disappointed with this fan and would not recommend it to anybody."
3,16 inch fan Comfort Zone,"this fan isn't as good as I thought it would be coming from the company that is a leading brand company, it just doesn't move the air like it should. Maybe it should of been a four blade I don't know, we are putting up with it but we aren't happy with it at all."
5,The kid loved it,I bought this for my seven year old grandson. His parents read it to him over a few nights. He truly got into the story and the suspense and the feelings of the characters. My daughter-in-law said she wished modern books were so engaging for children. No wonder it is still selling.
4,Good story and message - great read for a baseball fan,"My six year-old baseball-loving son really liked this book. It has a good message about confidence, and lots of play-by-plays. The book's quite dated -- kids go off to play unsupervised in the town's field, and the boy befriends a strange teenager in his small town -- but it was easy for me to explain these anachronisms to my son, and they give a sweet glimpse of 1950's life. Matt Christopher is no Dickens, but since we have to read sports books in my house, he's good enough for us."
1,Audio Sync...Need some!,"Very poorly done, I remember this when it was DeadLock and notWedLock, my best guess is, when they, for what ever reason, decidedto rename it to WedLock, they had to dub in voice tracks to coverup any words that mentioned DeadLock and let me tell you, the voicesync is WAY off, I will email Amazon to see if I can return thisbut being open, they may not allow it?SO, my 1 star is for the VERY poor quality of the audio track syncthe movie itself is ok as I am a long time Rutger fanSo be forwarned of this audio glitch,G2"
5,Excellent filter at a good price!!,"Bought this for a sheetrock sanding project since the stock filter simply blew the dust in the air. This puppy works!! No blowby! Old filter passed 80% of the dust from the wood stove ashes right through and in to the room...this filters passes zero...yes I said zero! If you have one of these vacs this filter is a must have and a no brainer-these vacs should have came with them! Shame on Shop Vac for installing the original, crap filter."
3,Nice look - not so comfortable,"These shoes have a very nice look, but the square edge turns out to dig into the top of my foot a bit. I think it's a combination of the shoe cut and the higher heal. These are shoes that look great with a dress or skirt, but I wouldn't want to wear if I'll be walking around much. It's a disappointment coming from the Aerosole line, which is usually very comfortable."
3,pretty shoe,"It's a pretty shoe, the heel height is listed as 1 inch, it feels more like 2 - a bit tight in the toe area even though it's squared."
3,good coming of age novel,"This novel is a great book for below level readers over the age of 12, as it deals with some mature subjects. I enjoyed the coming of age aspect of the novel, and its innocence as a Shaker boy grows up under a father that knows nothing past what the Book of Shaker has taught him. However, I was slightly disappointed in that although the boy is forced to mature at an early age, he also stops his questioning of the Shaker ways which separated him from his father before. He seems to finally just accept life for what it is, which can be a good thing, but can also destroy dreams. The novel is a great way for readers to see the ways of the Shaker life, and a boy's genuine love and respect for his parents, which is so often missed today."
3,A Kid Who Struggles,"I'm not to far in the book, but what I have read, it seems to be a interesting book. This book gives alot of descriptive and detailed information. I'm looking forawd into reading the rest of this book with the rest of the class."
3,A day no pig would die,"I am enjoying the book A day no pigs would die so far,it is a very interesting story. I like the part when Robert gets a baby pig from Mr.Tanner for helping Apron his cow have her calfs and save her life when she was choking on a goiter. Robert names his pig Pinky. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories taking place in the 1920's."
2,SAD AND CRUEL,This book was very depressing. Way to graphic and some times i could not even to bear to keep reading. I practically forced myself to finish it. It was very gruesome.
3,I found it heartbreaking,"I have always been an avid reader. I was probably about 12 years old when I read this book. What a tearjerker. I remember how this very lonely child and his pet pig spent long days together. They were best friends and his pig was like a dog to him. I was just reading the part about his pet's demise and in total disbelief about his father's lack of compassion,when my sister and my best friend entered the room and asked what was wrong. I was sobbing so hard I couldn't even speak, and when I was finally able to explain it to them, they giggled. I am now in my 50's and have been a vegetarian for a very long time. This book put a cute, pink face on our food, a food which I can live without. I will never forget this story, though."
3,Boring,"I gave this novel, ""A Day No Pigs Would Die"", three stars. The reason behind my judgment on this book would be because I didn't find it to be all that interesting. Basically all the story was about was a boy and his pet pig. The only other parts of this book was when they had problems with their neighbors or Haven, (Roberts father). I thought that this book was really nasty because of all the pig slaughtering. It went into too much detail during those parts and the mating scenes. Another reason why I didn't enjoy this book was because of all the detail. It took up a whole chapter for one little topic! I just think that this could be shorter and more to the point. With these reasons, I wouldn't recommend this novel for a younger audience."
2,Vermont farm life.,I thoght the book was good in the beginning and in the end becuse it had alot to do with death. Well most middle school kids would say that. The middle was not really that good. I recommend this book to some people like in 7th grade up.
3,A Day No Pigs Would Die,"I didn't like this book at all. It was sad and depressing because they could have of fed Pinky out and sold her for money instead of killing her. I didn't think it was right for papa to work so hard and not get paid at all. That was sad that papa was dying and didn't tell anyone. That one lady ,that said,""the way it describesthe mating habits were inappropriate"". I think she needs toa be nicer cause I don't see her name anywhere. I would tell my friends about this book. I think it was neat the way they would say ""my father was rich because he had true friends."" I must say he did a good job. I would like to read his next book A Part of the Sky. (In class! )"
1,The Most Horrible Book,"The may be the worst book ever! It contains no thought out plot, and I feel nothing towards its characters. After the second chapter I would of stopped. Peck used foul language to keep this pointless book going. If you read this book in school (like I did) I recommend that you transfer elsewhere."
2,A Waste of Time to Read,"The only good thing I can think to say for this book is that the writing is appealing. However, the scale of the misinformation on Shakers and farm life that this book includes is frankly astonishing. Why did Robert Newton Peck decide to include the bit about the family being Shakers? Moreover, why couldn't he have taken five minutes to research Shaker customs?Honestly, forget the ""inappropriate content"" in this book- it's marketing fabrication as realistic fiction.I suppose teachers think it helps us to get a sense of a different style of speaking. (Actually, my friend and I both noticed that the grammar gets noticably better in the course of the book for no apparent reason.)If you value your time, don't read it. If someone, such as your teacher or parent, is forcing you to read it, protest loudly. This book is a sheer waste of time."
2,Stinkburger!,"Good thing he got better. Don't bother with this one. Skip ahead, or reread ""A Deepness in the Sky."" This one ain't worth it. Shallow shallow shallow, and while the world is kind of neat, it's also kind of ""borrowed"" from better books, like ""The Stars My Destination."" Heck, go read that again. Everything else Vinge does is incredibly good. I suppose he had to start somewhere..."
1,Horrible! Can I rate this zero stars?,"Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.....I love action movies, superheroes, etc. But OMG - this movie was terrible. Painful to sit through. Kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't."
2,Extremely Boring,"Recently watched this movie, easily the worst flick I have viewed in several years. Except for a few decent action scenes, I would have rated it one star. I had fairly high expectations of this movie based on the opinions of some friends, but ended up falling asleep a couple times during the latter part of the film due to sheer boredom and finally just stopped it about fifteen minutes from the end. By that time I had no interest in how it ended and just watched something else instead. Good thing I only wasted $5 on this turkey, but lost over an hour of my life."
1,One of the worst movies of all time.,I watched this movie last week and walked out of the theater feelingreally stupid to have wasted $10 and 3 hours of my time on the piece ofjunk. The plot did not connect and it was just a hodge podge of goreand blood all over. Definitely will go down as one of the WORST moviesever made.
1,Worst movie I've tried to watch in years,"Terrible movie, I can't believe people are rating this garbage so high. Glad I only wasted $[...] renting this one, I tried to watch it, but after about an hour and half of absolute agony I ended up fast forwarding through the last hour just to scan and see if anything at all of interest EVER happened....it doesn't! The characters were dull and just seemed to be alcoholics that love to curse for not reason (and these were the good guys). I think about 3 of the heroes superpowers amounted to mega-pottymouth! Lamest movie I've tried to watch in years. Just when I thought it couldn't possibly get any slower and boring, the movie picks up the action by having one of the 'good' superheroes try and rape another one....when that happend that was it for me with this one, these are no kind of superheroes I want to know anything more about, or being 'watchmen' of anything of mine! Definitely not one for the kiddies!"
2,Not what I expected.,"As much as this was hyped, I should have known it would have been a disapointment. The main feature was way too dark for the small screen while the so called specail features were anything but. Don't recomend this one."
5,So who is watching the Watchmen?,I am very impressed with this movie; 5 of 5 stars. Just watched the extended Director's cut making it a very very long movie. The story is very complex with alot of flash-backs and even some flash-forwards. Several stories are intermixed until they finally all come together. Great characters. Unique style of photography and vision. I just added this to my list of favorites. I will have to see this movie a few times to completely digest and understand it; complex.
5,Pure Amazing,"This movie is pure amazing now I'm not going to lie the theatrical version was a great movie but it didn't capture a lot of the important points the book made. But this ultimate cut was amazing. When they mean ultimate they mean it. I love the way the beautifully edited tales of the black freighter in the movie. The ultimate cut of the movie is worth the price already but they give you much more, they give you commentary with the directer and over 3hours of special features. And it comes with the motion comic that is a page by page of the comic book but its in motion and it has voice acting."
5,One of the best DC comics movies yet!,"This has got to be the best DC Comics film ever made! It was great to see this film made so closely to the story of this classic 80's graphic novel.This movie is LONG, but, it really does hold your attention. I feel the whole cast played these characters very well. The costumes were more or less in the tradition of the comic ones. Rorshack is my fav character from Watchmen. Dr. Manhatten--Wish he would but some pants on!This film was truly made for the comic geeks. My other fav comic films, where I feel they kept much of the style and storylines close to the comics are Hellboy, Punisher: Warzone, Sin City and Johan Hex.If you have over 2 1/2 hours to watch a great film, chose Watchmen! (In my opinion, this DC film even blows away Return of Superman, Green Lantern the Batman: The Dark Knight flicks--for those are too long and over the top--WATCHMEN was just right!)"
5,YES,"So glad I didn't get the Ultimate Cut Edition. This looks like it has way better packaging, contents, and all at a better price. This is great!"
1,Just terrible...,"It is so sad that so much money is being spent on this type of movie these days... I don't know if it is a Republican plot to pre-condition all of us, to ""NUMB"" us to the horrors of war, or just bad taste gone wild... this movie does have some good acting and some great special effects, but the overall texture to this madness is nothing rising above vile and disgusting. We are subjected to 2 1/2 hours, almost all of it exibiting the lowest behaviors known to man... rape, mutilation, murder, baby killing, and corrupt government leaders (in this hell, nixon is still president!). If the goal of the movie makers was to instill a deep depression... then it worked! A-holes!"
1,"Price hike, not a happy bunny","Was really looking forward to getting this. Went to order just now, only to find the price hiked by $9. Not happy, will look elsewere. Shame on you amazon.The rating is for Amazon and not the product."
4,For the fan who wants it all in one package,"I think ""Watchmen: The Ultimate Cult"" is essentially a love letter to the fans. This version should, in no way, be viewed as a proper installment. The animated entries are offered as a possible ""what if"" had the director been given the resources and funds to makes a richer rendition of the graphic novel. If you've seen 'Superman II: The Donner cut', think about it like that. What your seeing are the possibilities without the advantage of finished production shots. So, yes, when you watch this version, please note you will need to suspend your disbelief a little deeper and understand the intent given here. This is not meant to compete with the theatrical or director's cut versions. If you enjoy the world of the Watchmen and want to delve a little deeper, sit back and enjoy this exploration. You'll be glad you hopped on board."
2,Yawn,"""Director's Cut"" versions of movies like this one are evidence why movie studios are generally wise to not give final cut to most directors. I did not see this movie in the theatre, but at three hours it was at least 90 minutes too long.And even then, it left me bored and baffled. I never got to know any of the characters, so it was a lot of special effects and kung fu action (which is why 2 stars instead of one).Doubt I'll be pulling this off the shelf again."
5,One Of The Best Movies Of The Year,I just don't understand how anybody could not like this movie. Everything about it is perfect in my opinion. A masterpiece. I'll definitely be getting all three editions. Rorschach rules. The opening credits are worth the price of admission alone.
1,Worse movie ever,This movie sucked worse than a vacume! Who wants to watch a movie where super heroes act more like villans. Lost 2 hours of my life i can never get back!
3,Watchmen maybe once,"Great special effects, Story line a little lame, though the concept was very cool. However the ending got very weird. It's a good movie to watch when the kids are not around."
1,utter rubbish,"This movie was absolute rubbish. It was at least 2 hours too long, had very few decent scenes, and was crappy, cliche and over stylized. Most of the acting was horrible, wooden and hammy. There was not one character that was not a complete $h17 bag. This movie was grim, dreary and depressing for the sake of it. The action scenes were brought about by completely manufactured scenarios and the violence and gore was way over the top and completely campy and corny. Many parts of it were so dreadfully boring too. Oh and Mr Inkblot..... That voice drives you up the wall after a while, it sounds like he has laryngitis and severe constipation at the same time. The later bit of the movie wasn't so bad, but the very end was anticlimactic and just plain stupid."
2,Don't let your kids see this!,This movie would have been fine without the slasher/horror movie violence. I caution any parents against letting their kids see this. I wish I had not rented or watched Watchmen.
5,Great!,"This product is perfect for any watchmen fan, the ship is a great copy of the original and the light and sounds are nice details also. I recommend it."
2,The bad overpowers the good,"I have to admit that it's hard to love the movie Watchmen. In my opinion, it's not as great as I had hoped. The only good things about this are the fantastic action and visuals. The fascinating character of Rorschach is also a welcome addition. But sadly, everything else doesn't add up. The characters aren't fully fleshed out (even the flashbacks aren't enough). The script needed some improvements (there were some silly dialogue here and there). Malin Akerman and Matthew Goode were horrible in this movie (couldn't they have at least tried?). Of course, it's just my opinion. It's fine my me if you love Watchmen. But to me, this didn't keep me interested. I give it a D instead of an F, mainly because of Rorschach and the special effects."
5,Awesome Movie,Highly recommended seller. Super-Fast delivery. Items as described. I love the Blu_Ray version of any movie and if you are thinking about buying either Muppets (2012) or Watchmen Blu_ray Director's Cut go for it.
2,3 hours I'll never get back!,"I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting for something to develop. Then, when something finally does.....it has a bland ending. The fact that the movie is 3 hours makes it terrible. I love a long movie...IF it is good!"
1,"Really, Amazon should allow for (-) stars","Before I saw this movie, I had never heard of the Watchmen. It seemed like something I would enjoy - heroes with a dark twist. Except there really weren't any heroes - just a bunch of morally bankrupt badly costumed losers. I have no idea what the hell the plot of this movie was Perhaps my brain blacked it out to protect my conscious self from realizing that movie was actually worse than I remembered it. Do not watch, do not buy."
1,THE WORST MOVIE SEEN IN MY LIFE,"GENTLEMEN, PLEASE SI ERES AMANTE DE LOS SUPER HEROES Let me tell you that this is the WORST movie you seen in my life is HORRIBLE! HISTORY has nothing interesting, SUPER ABURRIDO NOT SPENDING YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE SO BAD, DO NOT spend money on IT"
4,If you like dark movies you'll like this one,"Just a bit silly at times and you'll likely have to watch it more then once....But , all in all I enjoyed it. some times too much detail and background history, and other times you wonder whats going on.I like the old ""graphic novels"" and movies that are made from them , like Sin City. While this one is not as good in my opinion as Sin City, its still entertaining and well worth the 3 hours to watch.A bit gory and violent so not really sutible for young ones, but if your looking for something a little different... Enjoy."
2,What happened?,"Too much information. This movie covers some pretty intense subject matter. I suppose if I would have known that I never would have viewed the film. Rape, murder, male on female violence, and all around adult oriented subject matter make it hard for me to recommend this to anyone.I give the movie only 2 stars because the production team and actors save the film from not being watchable.Prepare to be subjected to intense subjects if you view this film."
2,BLAH,"I had great hopes for this movie when I purchased it, but was sadly disappointed. This movie was long, drawn out awfullness."
1,Not very good,"I saw this and I was like ""a cheap horror movie from the same compay that brought us the Puppet Master series, how can I lose"". Well I'll tell you how I lost, it was a horrible movie that I could barely finish. OK the story was horrible, come on a kid accidently gets shot, but luckily he summoned his doll clown before he died, to kill people of course. So to sum it up, even if your a big horror movie buff like I am, you can pass this one up, just not worth watching."
1,poor quality,"ordered 2 for me and my friend one showed up perfect, and the other broken. it was missing a spike in the middle of the grip. Not to mention if you nhave large hands like i do they wont fit in the snug grip."
3,G Force & Seiji - Just Another Number,"G-Force & Seiji's JUST ANOTHER NUMBER doesn't feel shy about coming on hard: ""The Return Of 769"" is a clatter of deep tones, hard beats and growling menace, while ""Circles and Lines"" strips things down a bit. But, almost as if to compensate, ""Bad Dreams"" and ""Unexpected Something"" veer into atmospheric jazz. For a while there, it's not as much G-Force & Seiji, but G-Force then Seiji. But ""Klipa"" starts the subtle merge of the two, a more rigid beat but with the same jazzy overtones. Some broken beat creeps in ""Vigorous Training,"" but it's back to the jazz with ""Sex in Space."" And finally, Bembé Segué brings her soulful vocals to ""Clear Vision,"" which seems completely different from everything else before. It's an eclectic album, perhaps a bit too unfocused, but still enjoyable."
1,good heavens!,"Good heavens! What an awful title for a book. Hearing it for the first time, I dropped my monacle. Hearing the title for the second time made me do it again. I really should stop being so horrified."
2,Aweful acting but the kids love it.,I find this movie difficult to watch as the scripting and acting is horrible but my kids love it. I wonder whether it was more the director who made the actors deliver their lines like robots as these actors usually are better than this.The Thomas fan will love it....the parent won't.
2,Buy at Your Own Risk,"Movie was not I how expected it to be. As for families this is more of a ""Buy at Your Own Risk"". As for me I was able to see this movie from a borrowed DVD from someone else who enjoyed it. When I stared watching Thomas on PBS I enjoyed it because it had trains all through the show which reminded me of my LEGO trains. For this movie forget it. Thank goodness it was a short 85 minute movie as I was getting tired of it after the first half. Next time please show all Thomas stories on television where he belongs not in movie theatres!"
2,"Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad","I hate this movie. I really do. My kids love it though, so that's why it gets two stars.This movie makes absolutely no sense to any thinking adult. There are so many errors it's annoying. And the acting...oh, my gosh. If it weren't for Alec Baldwin and the man who plays his nephew, there would be noone in the movie who could act.It's just an all around bad movie that should have gone straight to video. It's not even good enough to be a made for tv movie.But, of course, you kids will love it. And, if you buy it, you will be forced to endure it.s"
2,Originals Are Better,"If your children have never seen a Thomas video before, this movie might be a cute choice for them, especially if they're preschoolers who play with Thomas trains.HOWEVER, if your children already enjoy watching the older DVDs, the original productions that don't feature Alec Baldwin as Mr. Conductor OR any people who aren't wooden, then I'd skip this movie. It confused my younger children and irritated my older ones. As a parent, I expected a ""new and improved"" version of our older Thomas movies but, honestly, the only thing Thomas And The Magic Railroad managed was the ""new"" part."
1,This movie is horrible!,"We got this for our first child, and I wish we had ""magically"" lost this DVD after he was old enough to retire it. Having watched the TV series, this is so far ""off the rails"" with respect to the plot and characters, it's unbelievable. The story and acting is pretty abysmal on all levels. Alec Baldwin at least appears to be trying as Mr. Conductor, but Peter Fonda is PAINFUL to watch here. Did he get suckered into making this movie and then just deliver the most deadpan performance possible?Like a terrible plot line in a cheesy soap opera, I just wish it was all a dream."
3,What a mix of fantasy and reality!,"Thomas and the Magic Railroad is a wild mix of fantasy and reality. My 4 year-old son asked so many questions about what was going on that we could not concentrate. He did insist on watching it over and over because he found the confusion and excitement intriguing. I do have to give credit to Alec Baldwin. His role as ""Mr. Conductor"" is the highlight of the movie. If you plan an evening with this flick, make sure you are awake! It takes a lot of concentration for a kids movie."
2,Very scary compared to the other videos,"I have a two year old and rented this video when I saw it at our local store. Our son was generally puzzled and bothered by the live action sequences when he just wanted to see the trains. Additionally it had several scary sequences including the Diesel Engine grabbing and suspending the conductor in his construction claw over a chasm. I had to sit close to him during the entire video to reassure him that things would get better. Possibly a better video when he is older, but at 26 months it wasn't the best video for him."
2,3 year old loves it. Adults disappointed and confused.,"Our 3yr old boy loves Thomas. We have all the videos and trains, etc. He wants to watch this thing every day. He repeats lines from the movie and acts them out all day. It was great for him. We took him to the movies to see it together. He loved that, too. For him, we would do it all again in a minute.As parents, we could have done without the ""mean-ness"" of Diesel #10 and the fact that he wants to ""dominate and destroy"". He also uses the word ""stupid"" several times. Not nice.As adult movie critics, we saw laughably poor acting (with the exception of ""Mr. Conductor"" and ""Junior"". (Notice that even some of the 5-star reviewers agree.) Britt Alcroft directed and wrote it, and it is obvious that she should have asked for help from someone who knew what they were doing. If you pay attention, expect to be confused. We expected more because we actually enjoy watching all of the other videos, and they are really well done."
1,It's just awful,"If only I had known how truly terrible this is! Of course, my 3 year old adores it, so I have seen it many times. I finally had to hide it, because I couldn't bear to watch it again. What is the point of the stupid BIRD? What is wrong with Peter Fonda? Did NO ONE involved with this actually WATCH it?Worse yet, my husband bought him the STORY BOOK that goes along with it. So now we can even READ this ridiculous non-story on a regular basis. When my son's not looking, I skip pages hoping he won't notice.Stick to the short Thomas videos, which have some humor and spark. Avoid this depressingly bad movie like the plague!"
1,Let me off,"I am in pain! Forget that it doesn't fit logically let alone ideologically with the Thomas series. It is just a really horrible movie. Disjointed, blues cluesy at points, but not consistently anything but bad.In Sodor all the trains learn life lessons by making mistakes. They all have their flaws, but none are evil. They always have a chance to make it right. What's up with one evil engine? Scary, and pointless- no moral lesson here. And magic gold dust? The biggest discussion that I can have with my 3 children regarding this movie is, ""If an evil train ever gives you trouble, grab some gold glitter and toss it in the air""?"
5,GREAT FILM,WE LOVE THIS MOVIE. WILL PROBABALY HAVE TO BUY IT AGAIN SINCE WE WILL PROBABLY WEAR IT OUT!! ALEC BALDWIN IS GREAT AS MR. CONDUCTOR. THOMAS IS ALSO AWESOME.
2,Boring and unimaginative,"I read a read the review 'Good old Frankie Does it Again' and I said to myself, ""Self, I love hard tech-house!"" So I bought this album and was thoroughly disappointed to hear a very minimalistic sound with a slow beat rate. It would have been nice if there were some listening samples for this album, which has about as much imagination and creativity as a Daft-Punk album."
1,Disappointment :0(,"This is not for every Nokia phone! It certainly did not fit mine, though my model no. was one of the ones listed. Be cautious if you order this item because it does not fit the Nokia 6102 flip phone."
2,screen too narrow,The screen is way too narrow.You have to keepscrolling downto read the wholedefinition.I found it annoying to be able to see 4 words of a sentence at a time.There is no reason why the screen could not be as wide as the width of the product.
5,Missy Elliot-Under Construction,"This is a great CD. Some of the tracks on it are weak, but over it is a great party cd with tracks like ""Gossip Folks, ""Funky Fresh Dressed"", and ""Work It"". I purchased the limeted edition for Missy's ""Miss E...So Addictive"" and I was like where is ""All N My Grill"" ?? That was one of her biggest hits and yet it wasn't included on that cd or this one !Missy & Timabland produced a great record here, Over all this cd is awesome so if your into hip hop / R&B this is THE cd for YOU ! ***R.I.P. AALIYAH WE LOVE YOU BABY GIRL !***"
5,Corduroy 40th Anniversary Ed.,"""Corduroy 40th Anniversary Ed."" is such a cute story for children. The 40th Anniversary edition is special because it includes copies of the author's sketches as well as his notes and revisions. Some are in envelopes; others are folded over. It is quite cleverly done."
3,Not bad. Not good. Just okay.,At our house we don't read just at bedtime--which means we read dozens of books a day. I was looking to add to our bookshelf in the area of beloved favorites. From the nostalgic reviews I thought I had a winner in Corduroy but alas neither the one reading nor the listeners seem to be as as enchanted as I was hoping. It is just an okay book.There are positive aspects worth mentioning. We have adopted 3 dark skinned children so the main characters reflecting the same also added to the plus column for me. For little ones there is a bit of adventure with nothing scary. It ends on a happy note. For 5 to 7 year olds beginning to read on their own the text on each page is limited and the picture depicts the text. The red cover makes it easy to spot on the bookshelf which will help to identify it quickly if it is a favorite.
4,Corduroy,"Corduroy was one of my favorite children's books. I was excited to put it on my Fire so I could share it with my 3 year old granddaughter. She loved the story also. My only disappointment was not being able to increase the size of the font and pictures and they were very small. It may be that I needed to do it a different way than I have learned yet. Otherwise, I am happy with having this classic favorite."
1,I really wanted to like this book.....,"But it's just so poorly written.I have been an Amazon shopper for well over a decade, and this is the very first product that has prompted me to write a review.It's that bad.I couldn't even get past the first few pages -- it's riddled with cliches, poorly written and just not funny.Big waste of money."
4,Lovely,"Just a really wonderful, mellow album. I don't know why the ""official"" reviewer campares her to Dead Can Dance or This Mortal Coil-Milla sounds nothing like them. Everyone I've played this album for thinks it's Kate Bush. I wonder when she's going to stop making bad movies and get back to making good music."
4,Lovely,"Just a really wonderful album. Don't know where the ""official"" reviewer comes up with Dead Can Dance or This Mortal Coil-Milla sounds nothing like them. But if you love Kate Bush, you'll love this. Wonder when she'll stop making bad movies and get back to making good music."
4,Much better than expected,"Although it sounds like the music was programmed it is a very good and original album. I got the CD as a present and have to admit it was a good surprise. I was disapointed by the Ukrainian folklore song ""In a Glade"" since Milla sings it with a very strong Russian accent."
5,Utterly amazing!,"I bought this CD when it first came out years ago, and I still listen to it frequently. The lyrics are meaningful, the music is at times melancoly, but I dig it!"
5,Superb See I did learn something from Beavis and butthead!,"Okay, like many others, I fell in love with the music of Milla while listening to the tune of ""Gentleman who fell.."" on an episode of Beavis and Butthead in 1993 or 1994...(at least I know many others did also!). I loved the very little of the song that I heard, I just absolutely had to hear the rest....and went and bought it the next day. I truly fell in love with the whole album. My favorite songs are ""Gentleman who fell..."" and ""Bang Your Head"". ""Gentleman who fell..."" is a totally beautful song; I am not sure if the whole symphony is playing with her or is it snythesized,,, but I don't care....I just love the words and the music.My only disapoint with this album, is that there has been no follow up album :( Who does she think she is, Boston? haha j/k. Wow it's been six years now since she made that album. I have heard talk all through the six years of a follow-up album,, but have yet to see anything materialize. Bring it on Milla!"
1,I'm so curious!,I can't really rate this album cause I haven't heard it. But I think I'm going to go get this album. All thesse reviews sure make it sound worth checking out! I was just happily suprised to hear that she sounds like Kate Bush and Bojest and Tori Amos. I love that kind of music. Best of luck to Milla on her music career!
1,"Junk,This product should not be on the market.","Don't waste your time and money with this unit or Direct TV go with what ever cable company is in your area. They lied to me and stole my money and time. I had to send the DVR back to them 4 times, 4 and it still doesn't work. I have to reset it daily, the HD picture is not that great, and the record function doesn't work most of the time. So I called Direct TV and ask them if they were coming out with a better version anytime soon and they said they were still trying to fix the problems with the current one. I told them I had returned mine 4 times and had been very patiant but was tired of wasting all my time calling them up and returning DVR only to have to do it over and over. Please give me my money back and let me out of my contract, they said no. They told me if I didn't want my DVR I should return it to who ever sold it to me 2 months earlier. This product should not be on the market."
1,"Don't buy this receiver, it is broken!","The HR20-700 has a design flaw that will cause the unit to occasionally lock-up when you delete a Tivo'ed program. When the lock-up occurs the receiver will not respond to any input from the remote control or to pushing any button on the console front panel...included the power button. The only solution is to power down via removing the power cord or a ""red button"" reset. This forces the unit into a 15 minute restart. Try watching TV when you have to occassionally spend 15 minutes in reset mode. If you buy this unit, DirecTV will not allow you to return it and refund your purchase money. DirecTV will only send you another broken unit as a replacement. If you like to watch TV, stay away from the HR20-700. When the unit is working, it is great...but the lock-up design flaw makes this unit unusable."
1,AVOID THIS JUNK,"I replaced two R10-250 with two R20-700. What a mistake. I struggled with these things for days before pulling them out and putting the R10-250 units back. One of the units would show a ""searching for sat..771"" fault every time you reset it. The other unit would have to be reset before the pause would work, then would have to be reset before the playback would work. I am a tech with 45 years experience and I know bad software when i see it. Avoid these new non-tivo units if you possibly can! I got Directv to take these things back but it was an EPIC struggle. If you must buy these things, get them locally (Bestbuys etc) and make sure you can easily return them. Trust me you are going to want to."
5,Feel at one with the trails in beautiful NY,"This book is for anyone who has any intention of hiking anywhere in NY. From Long Island to Harriman to the Catskills to the Adirondacks, this book gives detailed descriptions on walks throughout all sorts of terrain. Each chapter has a brief history of the area so you really feel as though you are experiencing surroundings to the fullest. Plus, it is published by the New York/New Jersey Trail Conference which is apparently the premier source for information and maintainers of trails in the area. They also take suggestions so if you find some important detail missing from one of the trail reviews, you can write to the conference and give them your input. To make a long story short, I wouldn't go hiking anywhere in NY without this book."
1,Not good,"The book arrived without the included ""tingsha"" chimes. The book is written specifically about the symbology of the included cybals which were not included, rendering this book useless."
5,Hope for the Hurting,"Marriage is hard work. Marriage between two people with diametrically opposed faith systems is extremely hard work. Marriage between a believer and an unbeliever is even more difficult. Counselor Sabrina Black writes for those in just such difficult situations. ""Can Two Walk Together"" ministers hope and provides practical help that can assist couples to develop a vibrant relationship despite their faith differences.Reviwer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction ,Soul Physicians: A Theology of Soul Care And Spiritual Direction, andSpiritual Friends: A Methodology of Soul Care And Spiritual Direction."
5,Love it,"I have all Georges work on cd and I think this has to be one of the best, I love it I know its not like any of his other stuff not even Wonderwall Music. But its just two long crazy synthesizer songs, and I just think its great that someone so good at a guitar would make an album so different."
5,Hooray!,"The Quiet One out-Reeded Reed on this one, 6 years prior to the monumental Metal Machine Music. Harrison had already released WONDERWALL MUSIC in 1968, befuddling many a Beatle-Bopper with its Indian rhythms and off-the-Wall eclecticism- -and then this thing, this monstronsity, comes out of the Void like some squealing wind-up banshee on the short-lived and aptly-named Zapple lable as a follow-up a year later. A friend of mine bought it (""Look at this freaky COVER!!"") and upon first (and last) listen said with genuine curiosity, ""When does he start DOING anything?"" about three minutes into ""Under The Mersey Wall"". Blip, BLOOP, dooot, twhiiit- - - it just wouldn't end. He gave it about five minutes, looked at the cover with perplexity, removed the needle from the record and turned it over (""It only has two songs?""), hopefully placing the needle at the beginning of ""No Time Or Space"" and I had to laugh when it started with the identical BLOOP he'd interrupted when lifting the needle. Not bad."
4,Great buy,"these are hard working, easy to handle except slightly heavy. the clarity of image is great for an eyeglass-wearing amateur birdwatcher. I use them in my yard, on hikes in the woods or marsh and at the beach. Obviously they are not the product to use when expecting to identify birds at a distance e.g. ducks on a grey day a couple hudred yards away, but that is a limitation of the 7x35 design."
5,Great optics at a very reasonable price,"I bought this for my daugther's birthday - based on reviews in birding sites - and she was not disappointed! The optics are crisp, focus is very smooth. Great buy."
1,Already broken,"Bought this item because it was highly rated in Consumersearch. Used the binoculars less than 10 times and was removing the eyepiece cap and the right eyecup came off (this happened yesterday). Tried to reattach it but could not. These binoculars reportedly have a good warranty, so am hoping that when I contact Nikon I will be able upgrade this review. Prior to the eyecup problem, I was satisfied with the product."
2,"nonstick finish is great, but pan browns bottoms unevenly","well, the title says it all. . .i've baked 2 batches of blueberry muffins over the last few days, and the results have been the same. the muffins are ""done"", but they vary in done-ness.browning:the outside cups brown well, the interior cups do not brown well. the pan just seems to distribute heat unevenly.nonstick:the muffins didn't stick at all, but since the interior cups' muffins didn't quite set as well, i had issues lifting them out without separating the top from the bottom.overall:i can't recommend this model. . .perhaps someone with a convection oven will have better results. i'm going to try the Wilton Avanti model (recommended by Cooks Illustrated), if not the Chicago Metallic ""professional"" line."
2,2 1/2 stars,"Sisqo is talented since unlike many artist, he writes and produces his songs as well. He's not afraid to make a song about lingerie, but this album by no means is consistent. It's really mixed up. How would you feel if DMX came out singing a ballad about tender love? I'm sure you'd feel how I feel listening to Sisqo try to be a thug. A thug with platinum hair. That's a good one."
4,Just Great!,"Sisqo has always been talented, he was the leader singer of Dru Hill but later realized it was time for solo. It first i didn't like cocky Sisqo and tried to ignore his stuff, but after that ""Thong song"" was played a million times on the radio in the summer of 2000 and ""Got to get it"" was just as good i couldn't do anything else then go and buy the Album. And it was no dissapointment. It includes some tough fast songs like ""Thong song"", ""I got to get it"" and ""Unleash the dragon"" but also a lot of nice ballads like ""So Sexual"" and ""Incomplete"" wich actually peaked at #1 on the billboard, it's quite slow but the more you listen to it the more you will like it. The uptempo song ""You are everything"" is great too. A very good debut Cd nuff said."
4,"It's ok , nothing really special",I love the way he looks but that's another story. All he's songs on this CD are pretty good except the following :'' Is love here'' and ''Enchantment Passing Through ''.
5,The Dragon Was Sure Unleashed For Sisqo,"This alubm was awesome. The beats were off the hook. Sisqo had great lyrics and sang them like never before. This Album was determined to show that sisqo was more than a performer, he was also a artist. This cd has great sounds and is a good buy."
5,sisqo. what else can i say,"sisqo, where do i start this fool is tha bomb, this cd is more than 5 but if u dont buy this cd u must be crazy,he is the greastest singer in the world this is a musy buy"
4,Playa,"This album is hot. I am always jamming when it comes to The Thong Song, Unleash the Dragon, and Got to Get it. But he also has the slow jams for when it is time to turn the light down low like How can I Love U 2nite and So Sexual. This is a great CD for anyone who was and still is feeling Dru Hill. But on another note Sisqo needs to stop doing the Michael Jackson thing in his performances."
5,This ish is DOPE!,"Man, Sisqo came out TIGHT by himself! At first, I thought it would be just decent, but it amazed me with his excellent songs. EVERY song on it is good, you could just put the album in your CD player and listen to the whole thing straight. Songs to check - ""Got to Get it"", ""Thong Song"" and ""So Sexual"""
1,Sisqo = Squid Disco,"You should buy this CD only if you are a fan of hurting your own ears. This singer mumbles his way through boring, unrythmic songs that sound like regee meets disco meets Sigmund the Sea Monster. Unleash Sigmund! There's a good chance the only words you will be able to discern are swear words and ""thong"" (on ""Thong Song""). This CD can be useful if you have other CDs that you want to feel better about. Listen to this one a few times and anything will sound good. Hey, this guy should get togeather with Pink and start a band called Mauve-isqo. For better dance music, get ""The Best of Western Yodling,"" ""Barney and Friends,"" or a sound effect CD. In other words ANYTHING BUT THIS."
4,Its da bomb,"I think this is a very good album from Sisqo considering its his first solo album. I love almost all the songs on there;'How can I love you tonite,'Thong song,ect. I think he need to keep them coming."
5,The Dragon Came Wit' It!!!,"I really enjoy this CD. I bought it the day it was released, and I still listen to it today. Sisqo' is a very talented artist. I believe he is the male version of Beyonce'. I wanted his career to go sooooo far as a solo artist. I've been a fan of the Dru from their debut. I had met Sisqo' a few weeks before this CD's release and he was very excited. He enjoyed when I called him the ""next Michael Jackson."" I luuuuv this album!!! I can't say enough about it! I can't choose a favorite song because they are so good. This is a disc U can play from start to finish....continuously. Good investement. Should be in any REAL R&B collection."
1,Scandalously catastorphic,"This CD shows how bad the music scene really is! BThere are no good songs on here. The thong song is explicit, video and CD. That goes for all hip-hop and rap. Disgusting. Jazz Music forever."
2,Great voice....weak music,"I love Sisqo's voice. Sure it compares to K-Ci and JoJo, but I see some distiction. As for this CD, I was surprised to find out how bland it was! Unlike the music from Dru Hill CDs, most of the music in Unleash the Dragon sounded like every other R&B song they play on the radio on a daily basis.( the exceptions were only ""You Are Everything"" and "" Got to Get it""). I was bored even with the sex laced lyrics! What a waste."
4,A VERY GOOD ALBUM.,"Sisqo is a great entertainer and he doesn't have the best singing voice, but he surely knows how to make a song his own. Besides his voice, he knows how to dazzle on stage. As one of the lead vocals for the famous group DRU HILL, Sisqo always stood out from the rest and he was never was hated being the lead singer like Beyonce. UNLEASH THE DRAGON is a great solo debut and Sisqo captured everyone's attention with songs like ""THE THONG SONG"" and ""INCOMPLETE"". Suprisingly, Sisqo fell off the map and has disappeared for a long time but he's coming out with a new album in 2006. Be prepared for THE LAST DRAGON which will blow everyone away."
2,The Novelty Has Worn Thin,"Baltimore's Sisqo is really one of the most vocally talented bruthas out there, but who would guess from his choice of material? When Dru Hill hit its peak in 1998, he ditched the group in favor of this album, a borderline release that has only one memorable track, ""Thong Song."" Even that jam has grown tired after a million listens and is now the only tune by which Sisqo is remembered. Never mind that his next song ""Incomplete"" shot straight to No. 1 on the charts because that song, like the rest of the album, is pretty forgettable. Like many other talented singers, Sisqo needs to quit the oversinging and get better, less flashy, material. After all, there is strength in modesty."
4,Good but not the best...,"I really like this pack and play and it is a good deal for the price. There are some things that could definately use improvement though. One, the bassinet feature. When ours is put together (we read directions and everything, have tried and tried different things) the bassinet sags. We used it anyways (just for naps while we were right next to her) and never had a problem, but it looked scarey. The changing table attachment isn't convienent because you have to take it off and put it on for each use. Another thing, we use ours often and bring it to the grandparents houses for babysitting but we've had some difficulty with the sides sticking and not going down easy. And one of the 'legs' on it broke. Overall though, it works. A bit of a hassel but you get what you pay for I guess."
1,not as beautiful as pictured..,I was very happy to finally have found the perfect rug for a pet owner...Sisal like style..easy to clean... BUT yesterday when my 8x10 saddle stitch rug arrived I was disapoited with the color.....is much darker (cocoa/natural) then pictured...and I m returning it unfortunelly..(I was going to bring it to Brazil where I live)..I am SAD...but isn't as cute as in the photo..
2,"worked all winter, but ruined the extension cord","yep, it kept our tub free of ice all winter, however, we discovered when we went to remove it, that it had over-heated to the point that it MELTED the joint with the extension cord and was permanently affixed to it. I would consider this a safety hazard, and won't be using this brand again.It was one of the more expensive water heaters to run. We will be going with the official Rubbermaid one this year since we have to replace this one. Quite a waste."
1,Cd Rom for Windows 95/98 only,"Don't buy this book specifically for the cd rom, like I did. It only works with Windows 3.1, 95/98."
1,Not good.,"I did not like this book. It was too much like ""Resurrection"". At the end the bad guy's motive to destroy the world is ""just because"". The only worse ending to a series was ""Resurrection"". Yet if you like dark books without any humor, very serious, and a good guy who is bad then this is the book for you."
1,Don't read this book,"I really think this woman gets all her close friends to write good reveiws for her. I can't imagine any other way she could possibly acquire them. This book is awful and horribly written, do yourself a favor and skip it."
5,Bryan Ferry is the man!,Loved Roxy Music and even saw them almost 30 years ago. Must admit I bought this for his version of the IN Crowd! Over all it is a disc worth having.
4,My type of comedy!,"I usually do all of my movie watching at home but after listening to Russ talk about the movie on my way to work, I made it a point to see if it was available to watch on Netflix to see what the hype was all about. Man, let me just say that I laughed so hard that I had to close my office door so not to disturb anyone. I watched the entire movie and could honestly say that I never knew that Russ had that much talent remembering his Bobby and Jimmy days j/k LOL. The all-star line up and cast of characters were great and I even enjoyed seeing my sweetie's Shaqwanna & Alfreda make a cameo appearance :) Anyway, I definitely will be adding this to my dvd collection. My type of movie! Keep up the good work bruh!"
5,An Alternative Source For This Story,"Since the above edition is all but impossible to obtain--unless you have a spare couple hundred dollars lying around--the same novella is in the book ""Nineteenth Century German Tales"" ed. by Angel Flores. This volume, which is also a little hard to find, has the added bonus of other wonderful stories from the German Romantic era by Jean Paul Richter, Heinrich von Kleist, E.T.A. Hoffman, Jeremias Gotthelf, Adalbert Stifter, Gottfried Keller, & Eduard Morike. Good Hunting!!!"
3,"Overrated, but mildly interesting fable","Black Spider does have the feel of something written in the Middle Ages. The Story is very simple and could have been told in 25 or so pages. All the other reviewers seemed to just love this book. I did like the portrayal of the mob-mentality and I thought the black spider was a good allegory for the black death.However, the message of the book is very heavy-handed and the characters are one dimensional. After hitting the reader on the head repeatedly about how he/she ought to live a good Christian life, after awhile my attitude was ""O.K., Jeremias, I've got your point already."" In different hands this might have been an enjoyable little horror story."
4,A Good Read,"Fine stuff. Irving leaves most of his contemporary potboilerers in the dust. Well plotted, well crafted, and written by somebody who understands the English language. The one-star entry in this list must have been made by one of his competitors."
3,Magic Deckbuilders guide,"Well I wasn't satisfied enough, first of all because it arrived way too late and second of all because it wasn't in such a good shape after all."
1,Sadly Out of Date,"I won't waste much typing on this review. The title says it all. With about 3 new Magic editions released since this book was published, don't waste a cent on this stinker (8th Edition due out in July 2003). It was great when first released, but thye need to get on the ball and write a new one."
4,Good set,We bought these to decorate cookies at Xmas time. We enjoyed using them. They worked well enough on the cookies but I can see where they would work even better for decorating cakes.
2,Too tricky,"I think that Barnes concentrated too much on being a clever little literary expert and that overshadowed the actual novel. Yes, it could been a lovely story of a man overcoming a difficult time in his life, but please enough with the clever little literary devices. It became a trial to finish and I was very disappointed in what had started out as a clever idea."
3,this was an ok book...,"I think that this series has been very good for a long time, but now it is going down-hill. They leave out characters, like Cindy. And what ever happened to Christina's dream of being a three day eventer? Doesn't she remember Sterling? I liked how this series had racing and eventing, but now with all this racing, the books are getting way too repetative."
1,Warning: Do not buy this edition!,"The General Books version is some kind of scanned/OCR copy of the original. It is riddled with typos (no one seems to have checked what they scanned) and the layout is a disaster -- footnotes are interspersed with the principal text, for example. Unless you want to pull your hair out while reading this otherwise classic text, please find a different edition to buy!"
5,Wonderful Experience,"I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of participating in Turner South's My South Spoken Word events, and was greatly surprised and honored to be selected for inclusion in the book and DVD. The photos and words are a wonderful broad canvas of what the South really is, which bears very little resemblance to some cute British Chick talking about turnips in a bad accent. This book covers all aspects of Southern life, and the performances on the DVD are wonderfully honest and heartwarming. 3 guesses what my family is getting for Christmas presents!"
2,Not what I expected based on his earlier material,"Having recently heard some amazing live material from the late 70's while Duke was playing with Billy Cobham, I was really excited to check out this DVD. Seeing that such monster players like Louis Johnson were on it made me all the more excited, but I must admit that this performance was not what I expected. I was hoping for more of the 70's style material: heavier jazz, fusion and straight-up funk, but this performance was mainly an excercise in 80's pop and disco. Don't get me wrong, the musicianship is killer. Duke performs an amazing, unaccompanied key-tar solo and Louis Johnson's bass higlights are no-joke, but overall the performance was just too 80's mainstream and lacking the serious funk that I was expecting. It was just too 80's cheese...."
3,Mirror distorts around the edges,"All in all, this replacement mirror is not that bad. However, the edges distort the reflection quite a bit. I have gotten used to it over time, I would choose another seller if I had to buy another replacements mirror."
4,Surprising good initial quality...,"I know the Title sounds like an ad for Hyundai... ""Rated #1 in initial Quality!"" (which who cares when they run like a piece of junk a year later...what's the point) The fit was great, the only thing is you can tell the motor is cheaper as the mirror wiggles/vibrates at highway speeds. As to it's longevity, I'll post a review later should it stop working. For twenty eight George Washington's, it's hard to beat."
3,A true product of the 80&#65533;s,"Using synthesizers and computers to produce some odd but strangely catchy tunes; Dolby is the poster boy for the 80's electronic sound. Lost in the sound effects are some touching and quirky lyrics, but it is the sound that catches your ear and essentially dooms Dolby's music to a category that screams ""strictly 80's. ""Europa and the Pirate Twins,"" She Blinded Me with Science,"" and ""Hyperactive!"" all show how well Dolby could pull off this sound, but his best stuff is from his first album and later experimentations become less interesting. (Although it is intriguing to here Eddie Van Halen on ""Close but No Cigar."") This CD does cover Dolby's career (up to 1992) but probably is more Dolby than a casual listener wants. This one's basically for fans."
2,DOLBY FAIRS AT BEST.,"Thomas Dolby standout songs on this compilation are ""Hyperactive"" and of course the song that will always stand the test of time the Top 5 smash ""She Blinded Me With Science"".Otherwise this selection just falls flat. With repetitive bore compositions of ""The Flat Earth"", ""Europa"" etc. In my opinion Dolby tries to hard to be a composer et al...Beethoven while discovering a pop hook. It doesn't mix nor did it with the buying public.To this day Dolbys only hit was ""She Blinded Me With Science"".Not recommended unless you are a fanatic of Dolbys."
3,Not for Married Couples,"Not a bad book; just not what it seemed- at least to me. Literally the most complete sex manual ever, including some things I wished not to see. I wasn't offended, I just had the totally wrong idea of what I was getting. Quite liberal, very sex-toy oriented. Not necessarily what would be best for a straight monogomous couple- probably great for others though."
2,Too Politically Correct,"This book has a lot of information, but much of it panders to feminists and gays. And looking at some of the illustrations will make you wish there were no pictures at all. If you want a good, straightforward guide to sex I would recommend ""hot sex: how to do it""."
4,Great Manual!!,This is a wonderfully written book. There is a section for every person to find something of interest. There are several new things to learn here. It is written in a very mature fashion and doesn't make you feel uncomfortable whatever your reading about.
2,ho hum,"I was excited when I ordered this book, based upon the raving reviews I had read. And, I thought that if Ramsey Campbell was a master of the horror tale, then the stories that scared him must be really spine-tingling!However, I was rather disappointed when I read most of the ones he had chosen for this volume. Most of them were interesting, but none of them was really scary. A couple of them were thought-provoking and, in that way, a bit like an Alfred Hitchcock type of story. But, I didn't find any of them scary like in a Night Gallery sort of way. Maybe I'm jaded. But, I was not scared by any of them. These stories to me were more like bedtime reading, as you're about to doze off. Ho hum...."
1,Who's fault is it???,"Because of erroneous information listed in the product review section as to the song listing, I did not receive what I thought I was ordering. I don't know who is responsible for the data given on the product, the vendor or Amazon itself but I got this merchandise that I don't want and yet, trying to correct the problem was more of a hassle than the CD was worth so I decided to keep it. I can't really review the CD because I'm very prejudice towards it since it is not what I wanted and I see that the erroneous information is still listed on the website. Totally unsatisfied."
2,Klutzy,"I should have known better, but the battery test and other features lured me.But this meter is irritating in a number of ways. For one thing, it doesn't have alligator clips for the test leads. I thought I had a set that would fit, but no such luck.Then there are more ranges than positions on the switch, so they have to double up. To get DC volts, you turn it on, turn to AC volts and press FUNC. To get continuity, you turn it on, turn to diode, and press FUNC. Unfortunately I use DC volts and continuity a lot, AC volts rarely, and diode test never. So it's just a little more inconvenient for me than my old meter.I'm still waiting for the folks in Hong Kong to tell me where to buy the optional clamp-on accessory. Any bets?"
4,"Good Service, Good Product","Amazon offered the lowest price and the service exceeded my expectation. Have used them with excellent results at night observing the moon and stars. Much, much better than the much less expensive 10X50 I have been using. Also did some bird watching and found the brightness and color accurracy also much better than the cheaper pair. Another pleasant surprise was the Nikon allowed viewing at a much closer distance really making their range for viewing much more practical. The weight is about the same as the cheaper pair and I can only wish they were half the weight but this weight seems to be about the norm for this size pair. Plan to take them with me on all hikes and trips. They seem to be very well constructed and the rubberized coating makes them easy to use and comfortable. Recommend them to anyone looking for a pair in this size range."
3,Nikon Binoculars,I could not obtain a sharp focus with either eye with the first set. I returned them within two hours. The replacement set was significantly better. However they are not as sharp as I had hoped. I will keep them as they are OK but I did expect a sharper image. Perhaps I am asking for too much. The unit feels good and seems to be well made. One pleasent surprise was the 16x50 units came with a tripod adapter. So no need to purchase an extra one.A soft case that offers some protection but has a whimpy velcro closing top was also included.
4,Nice Powerful Binoculars,"These are nice binoculars, especially for great distances. I really like the adjustable eye relief feature. The images aren't quite as crisp as I hoped, but definatly satisfactory. They can be hand held without a tripod, better if you can rest your elbows on something."
1,I didn't finish and threw it out.,"horrible, self-involved memoir, supposedly about growing up Indian Jewish American, but really about me me me. Nasty family skeleton I didn't want to know about from grandmother's generation. I didn't finish and threw it out - something I never ever do. I didn't even want to give it to the library."
2,More Abba Gold,"I have been an Abba fan for years, and have Abba Gold which I love to listen to and sing along with. I purchased More Abba Gold thinking it would be as good in quality and recognizable songs; however, I was mistaken. I found this album poorly mastered, hard to hear, and did not recognize the songs at all. As a matter of fact, I thought they all sounded about the same. I am greatly disappointed with this CD."
2,poor leash quality,"I purchased two of these and with both of them the leash snap broke. One on the first time I used and the other before I even had a chance to use it. Very cute, but very cheap snaps. Will not buy another"
3,has no pizazz,"cd is good if you enjoy rogers, singing, but; the songs all songs are very similar. i would not buy it again."
5,can't you sleep little bear?,this was a book my children loved 20 years ago. i was happy to find it again to give to my grandson. book was in excellent condition.
2,"Sweet, but not exactly what I was hoping for...","This is a lovely and sweet book about unconditional love. However, it's definitely not the book for my preschooler as he transferred to a big bed and needed to learn to stay there. Pick another book if you're trying to teach your child how to fall asleep by himself."
3,Greatly middle of the road,"This was my first Rutherfurd book and it was a little tedious at times. It seemed to me that the author got tied up attempting to fit all of the history into the stories at times causing bottlenecks in the reading. The time frame was enormous and maybe just too much for any one book. I enjoyed learning about the Russian history and culture without having to have it force fed in a non fiction history tome. I didn't enjoy the style of story telling as much as I thought I would. There were some very entertaining chapters, but there were others that just were brutal to get through. It could have been more enjoyable to me if there were more connections between the chapters. It was more of a collection of short stories and I'm not a short story person. I can't recommend it, but I can't trash it either. It was greatly middle of the road for me."
4,real life history,I really like the way the author tells the history of Russia through a family down through the ages. It assists with the understanding of the history as well as the real life impact it would have had on the population. Easy to understand and keeps the reader interested.
1,Horrible,What a terrible movie. Jamie you should be ashamed of yourself. I think you knew the script sucked but you did the movie anyway for the money. Lame awful script with unfunny jokes. There are shameless and embarrasing commercial plugs for name brand products through the whole movie. I guess the studio didn't want to sink all their money in this flop so they got endorsements. A waste of Jamie's and Nia's talent. The screenwriter should be banished to a remote island
1,Only thing held up...,was us. I bought this stupid movie years ago. And after I watched it I went to the pawn shop and got a 1.00 for it. This movie is the dumps. If you like Jamie Foxx watch his reruns of the Jamie foxx show not this turkey of a movie. You could be held up doing something you really want to do than watch this gosh awful movie.
2,Don't get this item if you want to be able to SEE it,"I really like the quality of the print, since the paper is thick and glossy. However, the seller never makes it clear that there's a 1-inch thick white border around the edge of the poster, so the actual image of Nighthawks is pretty small. Much smaller than 11x14. Might have to cut the white border off, since it's a bummer, and makes the painting look really overwhelmed by these white bars around it. Next time, this company needs to make this kind of stuff clear to the buyer."
1,broken,Unable to review as it arrived broken due to poor packaging. Another one was shipped and it was also broken. Amazon was expedient in crediting my account. Excellent customer service. Sorry it didn't work out. It was just what I was looking for for my deck.
1,small size,"the description size of 28x28x24 is incorrect, the actual size is 24x24x16 which is printed on the box. we found this to be to small for our use so returned it."
2,not durable at all,"No idea what they have done, but this plastic cracks and shreds in about 1 hour of use. Awful! My old ones are still around and are far more durable."
1,Not Worth the Price!,I bought this thinking I was getting my monies worth. Little did I realize what I had purchased could be bought at walmart for a mere .97 . I actually bought a few there and they are made by the same company whamo. This price point is not even close for what is being offered.
5,The original Frisbee!,These are great! They teach the kids to throw sideways and no one gets hurt. I remember spending hrs with one & now my kids are doing the same thing. You can even teach a medium size dog to catch it in mid air!
1,They don't even have it.,"I waited for over 4 months while they back ordered it, every month sending me en email telling me it would be sent next month. Eventually I gave up and cancelled the order."
1,Why so expensive?,"Because these old dudes have to make money? Actually, one half of Naked Eyes is now passed on, so the remaining member rakes it in.Listen to the guitar introduction on David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"" and ""Promises, Promises"". Naked Eyes totally ripped off the title (from Burt Bacharach's musical) and that guitar part."
2,Outdated and Not Useful,"I checked this book out of the library, so for me it was not a waste of money, just time. Hopefully, this review will save you both money and time. This book will not give you all the techniques necessary to write well for the technical professions. Although it does do a good job of giving examples of how to write different types of sentences, and it also gives practice exercises at the end of each chapter, the body of the book gives you ""well-duh"" information. Also, as far as I can tell, it does not mention anything relaated to the internet or computers. I'm giving this book two stars instead of one because Section 2 Making Text Readable was somewhat useful, but the rest of the book was not."
5,type o negative meets luciano pavarotti,i heard one therion song on a nuclear blast compilation disc and it reminds me of type o neg- ative doing a gig and employing luciano pavarotti and other opera stars in it. it was pretty brutal.
4,One of my Fav Paints to Shoot,"This is one of my fav paints to use here in Tampa FL. I know paint varies by region, but here in Tampa this is one of the best. I dont shoot alot of paint when i play so i have tons of paint in my Garage due to the fact i always buy a new case when i go play. Well RPS Premium has to be one of the best. Was not a big fan at first because it is two half shells and not one solid shell. But they are right on point. only about 1 in 1000 will break on you in the barrel. Plus i left a case in my truck for almost a month an nothing was wrong with them...AMAZING!!!! I recommend these to anyone that wants a Premium paint at mid grade cost. Unless you dont mind dropping $70 on Evil or Marbalizer go with RPS Premium."
4,Great Puzzle Game,"This is a very fun one-person puzzle game. My daughter and I have enjoyed competing to see who can find the solutions first. There are 40 puzzles that come with the game, and you can download more from the web. We have been working our way through from beginner to advanced. The beginner games are very easy - basically teaching you strategies, but the higher numbered puzzles are very challenging, even for adults. The advanced games are tough even after you have gone through the solution. It is even fun trying to remember the solution - it is not easy even then. Some of the solutions are 240 steps long.The pieces of this game are very nicely done and durable. It comes with a nice carrying bag. I would highly recommend this game - lots of fun if you like puzzles. It will take you a long time to get through all of them."
5,Don Omar: El Rey De Los Reyes,"Wow!.... Even though Don Omar had a beef with Daddy Yankee before, he and Don Omar both have something in common. They're both inovators and try bring the genre to a whole new level with every new cd. Don Omar brought more of a variety of song themes and beats.To be honest, when I first bought the cd I was more shocked and confused than anything. I was just so used to hearing The Last Don and him on appearances on other cds, that it was wierd when i first heard this cd. BUT-- that's what happens to me a lot. I knew if i kept on hearing it, i would love it...........and i was right! King of Kings has something for everyone. All in all, the cd is great. A true fan will appreciate the cd and love every song for its own reason.DALE DON DALE!!!!"
2,"Don Omar, mas humildad, Jesus es el unico: ""King of Kings""","Don Omar needs to be humble and get down to earth. He should stop self-proclaiming himself ""King of Kings"", it just makes him seem insecure, trying to prove what does not need to be proven. I'm a big fan of Don Omar, he can sing (unlike Daddy Yankee,who only yells). He's my favorite reggaeton artist. Unfortunately, in this CD ""Don, Don, Don Omar!!!"" did not make a connection.""Angelito"" is the best lyric in this CD, and there are a couple of other songs that I liked; however, this CD is much more different than the quality we're used to from Don Omar. Some of the songs sound like something you would hear from Juanes.Thumbs down for this CD!"
4,Da Don!,"I love this guys music and I met him! He is cool. At first I wasnt sure of this album but I now cant get it outa my car. considering Im only just beggining to learn spanish so dont understand teh lyrics, I am addicted to this spanish regaetton music! The beats on this album are all very different and some I found are more catchier and better to dance to than others but all in all its a great album. Look forward to another one coming out..........."
2,King of Kings?????,"King of Kings???, no me hagan reir....este cd es una basura.Con exepcion de unas cuantas las demas son basura...La cancion CONTEO, no se sabe si es para los niños de Kindergarden para que aprendan a contar...digo que clase de mongolada, estupidez, etc... es esa???"
3,Two Great Brits together!,"Recorded in 1993, this cd has a ""live"" concert feel to it. Shirley Bassey is supported by a large orchestra and chorus. Highlights are the lesser known tracks where she holds back in her interpretations. ""Tell Me On A Sunday"" and ""The Last Man In My Life"" from ""Song and Dance"" being the best tracks. Surprisingly Bassey adds little new to the standard Lloyd Webber fare of ""Memory"" and ""All I Ask Of You"". The power of her voice lifts ""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" from ""Phantom"" and ""Sunset Boulevard's"" ""As If We Never Said Goodbye"" above the rest."
5,Great,Great book. The author provides a wealth of knowledge from simple ideas to detailed projects that both outdoorsmans and native americans used. Absolutely worth every penny.
1,Tired of replacing broken bolts,"I own a set of the Porter Cable cement shears and the Kett cement siding shears. The are exactly the same except the Porter Cable has a button to lock shears in the on position. They both have the same problem. The bolts that hold the blades in break very easily and are a pain to replace.They need to use stronger bolts in these things.The guy I work with has same shears with the same broken bolts.If you do buy these and need replacement blades, buy the ones for the Kett.You get all three blades for less than what you pay for just the center Porter Cable Blade.They fit perfectly."
1,Not New Order at all,"This CD is very misleading. There is nothing in this that even comes close to the New Order style.I was so offended by this CD that I didn't spend the time to really understand what was in it. So I wrote a review right away to warn the population. I am re-editing my review after a couple days of reflection.These are songs that the band really enjoys listening to. Maybe they were inspired by these through out their long career ...OK great...now what? I spent money for this? I would prefer to view this list on their web site or during an interview.I find most of the songs long and annoying. For example, the song ""I feel love"" was decapitated by the remix. I mean, there are so many good remixes of ""I feel love"" on the market - why put this awful one on the CD?..."
2,"Informative, but wordy","Reading this book was much like reading a college textbook. The information therein was helpful, but the style was wordy and technical. The book could have been more concise. As a reference guide, I preferred the book House Buying for Dummies."
2,2.5 stars Not as good as I thought it would be....,"I think the tittle was more an attention grabber than the actual story for me. It could have been a good read if it wasn't so drawn out whew! details details details!!! It was good the women weren't completely crazy they actually made a pretty good team but the ending? I HATED the ending! The story line was a good one but it was so drawn out it made it more boring. Although there was some laugh out loud moments, at times I found myself skipping through just so the author could get to the point. If you have ever been cheated on and loved the man enough to make his lover your live in nanny/new friend and add more stress on yourself and your family? I reccomend this one for ya"
4,Good but not realistic,"The book was good. But to be honest what woman you know is going to take in her husband's girlfriend. Even though the women became friends, they both lost something while trying to prove a point."
5,Awesome: Love conquers all!,"Get pass the title and enjoy the ride. The characters are filled with so much excitement, I couldn't put the book down. This book puts a whole new twist on cheating. I hated to see it come to an end; Brandi, Vernon, Tanya....were brought to life on each page. Imagine inviting the person your spouse is cheating with into your home,,,,,,This book was soooo gooood!!"
3,not that hot,I really was hoping to have a book similair to zane's but it was not...I had to skip some pages to get to the end....I was not pleased with the book.....
3,Too busy,"The book was ok, but would've been more intersting if Tanya's story had been more developed. Her story left a lot to be imagined and would have had me more in tune with this book. There was just too much going on in this story as it was written. The beginning was funny but it was definitely not what I was expecting based on the description."
5,"H. Holder ""50s music buff","In a word ""Amazing"". What a varied collection of unique musical sounds. A cornucopia of sounds that facinates and intrigues the ears. This is my second Andreas project purchase and will definitely not be my last. Highly recommended, especially to those with sophisticated tastes in music."
5,OH HEAVENLY MUSE,"Ms. Paschen is the best American poetess to rise above to the heavens of Parnasian poets. Her poems shine as beacons of purity. Her poetics are superior to any of her generation. The ""Stealing"" series of poems along with her ""Father"" poems are artful as Marianne Moore's. Let us celebrate a true genious!"
1,Very offensive and not at all informative,"I have traveled to Peru and am very upset that I spent my money to watch someone criticize and make fun of the country. He pays to see a shaman then makes fun of him, calling it ""Mambo Jambo"". Instead of pointing out the various architectural styles (the Spanish and the Moorish), he just says something like ""Here you see some Spanish architecture, but look at all the rubbish on the ground."" There's so much to see and experience in Peru, but it's like all he wanted to do was pick places he could make malicious jokes about.I love watching the way Justine Shapiro shows a country, even when she sees things she does not like. I'm headed to buy some more that have her as the host and will never spend my money on any DVD with this Neil Gibson person again."
4,When Women had Tails,"Okay a crazy fun look at the sex life of cave mens first encounter with the opposite sex. Silly and suggestive great to get the endorphins (health cell builders) flowing, fun for teen and adult in my opinion. (Only suggestive scenes no nude scenes)First watched at the Drive-in with my girl. Hey we watched the show????? We were young teens at the time. Enjoy"
2,Buy Dave? Bye Dave!,"Sure, okay, the recipes could be as great as the photos, which are indeed great; but it makes me blind with anger when I open a cook book and find, right from the get-go, that most of the recipes call for some ``special'' ingredient only available from -- guess who? -- the cookbook author! In Dave's case, recipe after recipe calls for -- guess what? -- Famous Dave's Steak seasoning or Famous Dave's BBQ Sauce or Famous Dave's Chickn' Wing seasoning. Given how much this book costs, Dave ought to be doubly ashamed of himself. So Rich Melman says, ""Dave Anderson is a guy whose heart is even bigger than his appetite.'' Don't you believe it. He's a bid-ness man through'n'through (as is Melman, for that matter)."
1,Humm.. Not really necessary if you already have a manual,"I am disappointed. Maybe for a beginner who lost his manual. There is nothing really new on this books I rather recommend ""SQL Windows 5: Developer's Guidethat is a lot better."
4,11 tracks here are still the song's best 'live' performance to date,"If you're putting together album-sets of the best from all four solo Beatles', an amazing 11 tracks from `Paul is Live' could go onto one set or another. Let Me Roll It, Michelle, My Love, Magical Mystery Tour, Paperback Writer, Penny Land and Live and Let Die could go onto a LIVE set. Good Rockin' Tonight could go onto a Covers set. Biker Like an Icon could go a main set of originals. And both Hope and Deliverance and the I Wanna Be Your Man soundcheck could go onto bonus sets. Great stuff. Would a re-united Beatles have played some of these better? I doubt it."
3,Eh...,"From the book description, I was really excited about reading this book. Sadly, it didn't live up to my own hype. The plot itself is interesting, but it just seemed ""blah"" to me. I appreciate the fact that the book is supposed to be fast paced, but I felt it was too choppy. If you really love the Warhammer 40k universe, borrow it and don't buy it. If your only vaguely interested in it, I'd recommend reading another book."
4,ww1 of future,the book was good it showed the true horror where all your friends are with you then boom they are gone but all in all good bookit was also interesting how he put a WW1 type battle in the futurewhat I didnt get the adding in of rat boy
2,Fifteen Hours,"Quite by accident, Arvin Larn newly inducted to the guard and just 17, finds himself the sole survivor of his troop on a planet they werent supposed to be on. The average lifespan on this planet... 15 hours.While it could have benefited from better editing, I still find the story compelling. War doesnt paint a pretty picture and neither does this novel."
3,Meh book,"The book has its moment, but I find that I can't connect with any of the characters as the book is extremely one dimensional. That and also the twist is so obvious made this book a little less enjoyable than it is. Thankfully enough I got this book for cheap or else I would be very dissapointed."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"Wasn't a fan of the novel. The book is mainly about the feelings of a new guardsmen. Starts from leaving his home through basic training and his first engagment. His fears, terrors, and the sheer hell of war are described. To me this is out of place in a work of science fiction as the main theme. Instead of this book you could and should read a non-ficition book about a real soilder and his experiences. You would get the same under lining themes and it would be real.The book did have some good points but they were few and far between.The reviewer who said ""May get a bit draggy as the story keeps hinting at the meaning of '''fifteen hours''' but never quite getting to explaining it till the end."" made me laugh it says it right on the cover what it is."
2,"""LOW-BUDGET DOUBLE-CROSS MYSTERIES MOVIE""","The only reason for seeing Liar's Poker, is seeing Amelie Heinle, ""Victoria"" from ""Young and the Restless"", she is the femme fatale in the movie. She is an under-appreciate actress, who should get better roles.The whole movie is about four friends, who are trying to out-con each other for the dough and survival.If you viewer are looking for eye candy, Amelie Heinle is the prize. Her sensual beauty and beautiful darting eye is a revelation, you won't be disappointed.With better roles, she could be the next Karen Allen, the actress from Animal House and Raider of the Lost Ark."
3,Pleased,"I am very pleased with this bag. My only problems with it have been I find it to be a bit smaller then I really wanted & it's all in the open which is against state laws in massachusetts where I'm in beauty school. I can't keep brushes in it because they need to be in a close container. Other then that, I'm happy with it. I probably won't use it much professionally but I will use it for personal use.Sorry if this review was sloppy I was writing it quick but I wanted to get this opinion out there."
5,What a great looking man's watch!,"I bought this watch for my husband's last birthday and he has worn it every day - even though he has four or five other watches as well.This is really a GREAT LOOKING watch. It's very stylish, and somewhat unusual because of the ""rose gold/copper"" look metal that contrasts nicely with the high gloss silver. While it is something of a ""designer"" watch -- and my husband is not a ""designer"" type of guy -- he loves it and has received a lot of compliments on it from other people.The watch keeps good time, the band is easy to get shortened at any standard jewelry fix-it place, and I would highly recommend this product."
4,Wonderful engagement with the past,The gentle passage of the musical score and the natural engagment of Matt Munro's with the musical score is a past joy revisted whenever played.
4,Neat scooter,"This is really a neat scooter but I bought it for my son. He is 5'4"" and growing daily and the handlebars are not adjustable for height. The razor large wheel scooter has an adjustable height handlebar that makes it easier for taller people to ride. I will probably end up giving this scooter to my daughter and getting a razor scooter for my son. He does love the Kent but just cant ride it comfortably because of his height."
5,excellent quality,"this is a nice heavy duty scooter - i have even ridden it as 200 pounds - that is how strong it is.my 17 yo nephew rides it when he visits, he weighs about 120, and he goes over jumps and skids it, he loves it.i acutally bought it for my son who is 6, 4 ft tall and 50 lbs - it is a little too big for him to ride comfortably, i think another year would do it.recommend for taller or slightly older children"
1,Scooter arrived damaged and assembled improperly.,"This seems like it should be a good product. Kent International, Inc. of New Jersey has chosen China as the country to obtain their cheap labor, and it shows.Everything that was supposed to be pre-assembled was backwards, upside down or damaged. I have sufficient technical skill and all of the correct tools, so I was eventually able to assemble the entire scooter from the bottom-up. On top of the assembly and adjustment problems, the frame of the scooter was dented and scratched.If you are interested in purchasing this scooter, I would recommend getting it at a local retail store already completely assembled."
3,nice scooter,"this scooter is pretty nice, im giving it 3 stars because its really heavy, it only comes in blue, its hard for young kids to manage, and finally its not very fast. However its sturdy and well made, would be better for maybe kids 8 and up."
5,Sweet Ride,My 9 and 11 year old girls got the purple edition of this scooter for Christmas. We camp a lot and thought this would be perfect for the rough terrain we run across. So far it's been used on a nature trail and blacktop. We love this scooter! Very easy to assemble.
3,Fun,It works great on gravel as well as a smooth surface. Hand brakes are a great bonus. Foot platform is wide enough for beginners to feel safe.
4,fast and fun,"My 2 kids recieved these scooters for x-mas and have been on them every day since. They say they can go faster and do more tricks than thier razor scooters , they also go offcurbs and up bumps with a higher wheel base.The only problem we found was the hieght of the handlebars, they only goes so far and my 12 yr old would like his higher."
2,Inoperable Brakes,"This scooter seemed sturdy, but we never had a chance to use it because try as hard as we did, we could not get the brake pads to make contact with the wheels. We tried every suggestion in the pamphlet. Also, at the end of the instructions it states ""If you are unable to get the brakes to work take the scooter to a bike repair shop for professional repair."" The consumer should not have to go to these lengths to get something to work properly (although Amazon was very professional about it and willing to pay for the repair). The kick stand is so not necessary. It's too small and the scooter falls over easily. I did not like the fact that the foot plate where the child stands is made of sub-standard plastic. I thought it would be metal. I returned this item for these reasons."
5,Marineland Magnum Carbon Container Sleeve,"Yes, they are the correct sleeve for my 350 Magnum filters. I have two filters in my 150 gallon fish tank."
5,The best no. 1 ever,"If you're not the one is Daniel Bedingfield's 3rd single and is heading for the top, infact it's already there. The video for this tune is fantastic just like the song. Daniel wrote this himself, showing us clearly his superb talent, he is a true star. This song will have you singing along in no time, it's the best song to enter the charts this year without a doubt. If you don't have it yet go to the shops this minute because they are being snapped up. If you love Daniel you will love this and lets face it who doesn't love Daniel! If you need proof of how great this song is just look at it's chart position!"
3,not enough diversity,"One attraction of the book is that it contains papers from a diverse set of authors. Pointedly, not all of whom are American. There is a good range of viewpoints. Not all of which you might agree with, as the previous reviewer has remarked. There are different worldviews given here. Notably with the chapter by El-Affendi. But also too with the writings by Cui, who gives a Chinese perspective on US foreign policies.But perhaps there is not enough diversity in this book. The continuing expected rise of China surely might warrant a longer discussion of it, vis-a-vis the US. Plus, there is nothing given from the Indian or Russian contexts.This is fundamentally the problem here. The book is not that different from what you might see if you asked for articles from a political science department at an American or British university. In fact, that is exactly where most of the authors hail from."
4,french translator,"The book was very helpful. My only complaint was there were quite a few words we came upon during our drive across France, road signs and directions etc. that were not part of the limited dictionary.The CD's included were great since they taught how to pronounce the words as well as read them."
5,SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY BACK IN TIME,"Just imagine that the big bands were still around and could be reassembled to record in today's sound. It can't happen, of course, but in the fifties and sixties Capitol Records did just that, and the result was repackaged in 1995 and presented in two volumes, each a 2-CD set. Both are excellent compilations, which are well worth searching out."
4,"Marquee attraction fine, but check out the side show!","Sideshow Lorraine that is! Black Playmate Lorraine Olivia, whose video profile, is the added attraction at the end of this tape is worth the price; the PMOY is a fine specimen, but we know our babes down here in Texas, and let me tell you that Lorraine is Grade-A! She's got a very pretty face, mischievious eyes, and (the really important stuff)curves you can really grab hold of, lips you're dyin' to mash up against, a mouth where you want to do some deep drilling exploration, generous, plump knockers that look delicious, and a behind that you'll want to spend all day exploring. Every scene is good - from her naked in the desert, the Egyptian theme, but my favorites are Lorraine's scanty top and cut-off coming off while she soaps up and washes a car, and her striptease on the airplane (when she sticks her tongue out in that scene, you'll melt) She's one fine filly, and ought to come down to Texas, where we know how to treat a girl like her!"
4,"Good DVD, lackluster CD","The DVD portion of this package is excellent. The sound quality is great and the camera work is decent. Having all of C&C;'s music videos in one place is great, as are the (brief) interviews and the ""making-of"" documentary.The CD portion on the other hand is a bit of a let down. Although it's taken directly from the same show at the Starland Ballroom, the audio quality is not up to par with the DVD. If one didn't know any better, they might mistake the CD for being recorded from a different show; it actually sounds that much different (and average at best).Buy the set for the DVD and just think of the CD as a bonus and any C&C; fan should be satisfied."
5,Great Box Set,"In fall 1963 I was 10 years old living in Washington State. My mom bought three albums for me~ ""Andy Griffith"" ""Rick Nelson"" and....""21"" by the Kingston Trio. (I still listen to Nelson, John Stewart, and, of course, the Trio) How glad I am to have many of the best cuts from that worn-out lp on this CD. ""Try To Remember"" ""Run The Ridges"" ""Run River Down"" take me back to when JFK was president, and the world was quite different, indeed. Thanks to the producers, and thanks to the Kingson Trio."
1,This is an award winning writer?,"Somehow, I stumbled across the first paragraph online. I thought it would be a fun read, but the beginning on the book was the best part. Poor characterization, difficult to understand motivation of ""trust"" between the characters, and silly shenanigans. Didn't even make complete sense in the end. Poorly edited."
2,Beyond boring,"I have been a Linda Howard fan for over 10 years. Absolutely love all of her books because they're funny and romantic. This book was neither. Frankly, I quit reading halfway through the book because the main characters hadn't even met yet. I just didn't care anymore. They were both so boring! This is shocking for me-unable to finish reading a LH book. The premise felt a little too ""Alias"" like that I just couldn't get into. Perhaps someone could tell Linda Howard that her romance books are her specialty and she doesn't need to follow Catherine Coulter into all this suspense/murder stuff."
3,Story is okay -- Recording is AWFUL,"I love Linda Howard and will probably eventually read all of her work. This story falls somewhere in the middle of the ratings. Not by any stretch her best--but still compelling, to a point. I chose to enjoy this story via the audio recording -- and quite frankly, that almost kept me from finishing it. I can't begin to understand why Dick Hill was chosen to read for Swain. He's obviously a very talented voice actor, but for this character his voice was completely wrong--- he sounded 40 years older than Lily -- and I had a really, really hard time overlooking that. It detracts so terribly from the story, I never could just lose myself in the action. I just kept thinking ... ""Wow, Lily is getting turned on by Grandpa. Eww."" I would strongly encourage the distributors to consider re-recording this with a younger actor. Joyce Bean was amazing, and Dick Hill is good-- but he's just NOT Luke Swain."
3,"Well, now...maybe 3 1/2*","I could never give a Linda Howard one star - yes, I agree, it is not one of her best, however she is still my favorite author. There are worst books out there, but compared to her other books, which I can read again and again, this one I will probably not reread but I will keep anyway."
2,Kiss Me While I Sleep through this book...,"The only reason I finished this book was because I spent so much money on it. It didn't keep my attention at all, because the characters are unlikable and underdeveloped. Also, the blunt ending seems as if the author forgot to write one.As a Linda Howard fan and a romantic suspense fan, I can't recommend this book."
4,Had to read it myself before I accepted the critics....,"Word for it, I think this was a very good book. I'm glad the story takes us back to CIA, to me this book is somewhat a spin off of ""ALL THE QUEEN'S MEN"". This book was just what I suspected for my favorite author. Although, it took me a while to buy for the simple fact I was going by what critics were saying about the book. Never again will I do that. I love Linda Howard's work and always will. Lucas and Lily shared trust, understanding, and passion, that existed for a short time through their past relationships. Lucas had a life of being somewhat isolated and alone, and Lily had a life where she dealth with death practically on an everyday basis and was always looking over her shoulder. Although unusual cirmcumstances brought them together, their union made their lives worth living again. The book was a page turner and a keeper in my opinion. Buy it!!"
4,Exciting to the very end~~,I am a huge HOWARD fan and have been for a long time. I think all of her stories are just terrific.If you are a reader who enjoys escaping reaality for a few short hours each night then this is one book you won't want to miss. KISS ME WHILE I SLEEP is exciting to the very end~~~ Give it a try.
1,Linda Howard's worst by far!,"I won't get into the story line as other reviews have done so. But being a HUGE Linda Howard fan I just had to say this one was so bad that I had to let others know so they don't fork out the money for a hardcover like I did. If you really want to read it wait till it comes out in paperback--it however, won't be worth it. I own all of L.H. books and this is the only one I won't keep. She is a super writer but this one lacked just about everthing. The sory line was weak and the people--I just could not relate to--it seemed like this book was just ""pumped out because she had to get one out"". Nothing about the book held my interest. This was a big BIG suprise for me and I was really diappointed!"
1,Getting rid of Norton,"Those upgrading to OS X 10.4.x from an earlier version, and who have already installed Norton products under the old OS, can remove them by means of a Unix-based utility that finds and erases Norton files, including the invisible ones. They would be well advised to do so, since older Norton products don't work with 10.4, and interfere with the functioning of the built-in firewall. There are several such utilities posted on the web. The one distributed from the Kenyon College site works perfectly, and can be found via Google.The built-in firewall can be turned on via the ""Sharing"" menu in the Control Panel.As far as anti-virus protection goes, that's an entirely theoretical issue as far as Macs are concerned. Anyone who wants to go down that road would do well to explore the various on-line Mac forums before deciding."
1,Norton Internet Security Mac 3.0,"Not until I was installing NIS Mac 3.0 on my new iMac did I receive install errors indicating that only a limited portion of the suite works on an intel-based iMac. The intel iMacs use OS 10.4. The older powerPC Macs use 10.3. The small print on the box indicated it was for OS 10.3 but the Amazon specs only indicated compatibility with OS 10 Macs. No updates/patches fixes are out on the Symantec website (as of 10/15) for use of this product with OS 10.4, yet intel iMacs have been shipping for 9-10 months now. Symantec is off on this one. I have mailed-off for the 60-day money back guarantee from Symantec as a dissatified customer."
3,Na ja,"Nicht gerade umwerfend. Wie eine x-beliebige Krimiserie im Fernsehen. Kein Meisterwerk. Alle lügen und betrügen sich gegenseitig. Depardieu wie Sophie Marceau, die alle reinlegt. Sie sieht allerdings recht durchschnittlich aus, die Rolle hätte mit irgend einer x-beliebigen Frau aus der Nachbarschaft genau so besetzt werden können.Mir gefiel die französische Umgebung in Paris und Marseille, aber die ständig schnell quasselnden Schauspieler habe ich schon in besseren Filmen gesehen. Ein mal sehen reicht. Es gibt aus Frankreich ganz tolle Kriminalfilme wie ""Frantic"" oder ""Fahrstuhl zum Schaffott"", aber dieser hat mich nicht sehr beeindruckt."
2,Sweet little ladies ... and Satan?,"Let the buyer be forewarned... I bought this item because I have always admired Helen Hayes, and the first three episodes were quite enjoyable, with typical 70s humor, plenty of slapstick and the purposefully exaggerated acting used at that time. I noticed that the solving of the murder was a far cry from current shows with their logical, forensic investigation, but I could live with that. The deal-breaker for me was the final two episodes, the first (The Devil Made Me Do It) dealing with Satan and witchcraft, and the final one (Dark Day for Bluebeard) with a script centered on a ""washed-up horror movie icon"". These were very distasteful and offensive to me, not just as a Christian, but also as an intelligent person."
3,"Closed Captioning, Please !","This show was on TV from 1972-1974, 40 years ago. I'm sure I'm not the only person who saw & loved this show at that time. We original viewers are now in our 60's or 70's - Many (including myself) have hearing difficulties. I doubt there are many young people wanting to see this show so WHERE is the Closed Captioning for us Seniors who really want to re-view these movies but can't hear the dialogue clearly?"
4,Snoop Sisters Complete Series DVD - TOO EXPENSIVE,"Snoop Sisters Complete SeriesWould love to purchase this as a Mother's Day gift - but in these very difficult times, cannot justify the expenditure. Perhaps the suppliers could consider lowering the price, whereupon they may get a very pleasant surprise from the many interested parties who are prevented from purchasing this DVD only by the exorbitant price - surely some profit is better than none!Tku for bringing this wonderful series out on DVD, but please lower the price."
2,"OK, but","This product is as advrtised and as I remembered it from years ago. The problem now is, I am hard of hearing and there are no captions, so I can't enjoy it. When I ordered it, I thought all things now had captions for the deaf. I know those who can hear will enjoy these films. They are wonderful memories of 2 actresses who were great in all they did."
3,Crime authors turn to crime solving,"This set consists of five full-length mysteries. The talents of Helen Hayes and Mildred Natwick are totally wasted in the silly first show; but somebody must have demanded better scripts because the other four were fairly decent. I wouldn't recommend this set unless you found it for a really good price, though."
3,MUSIC Vallenato,I ordered this DVD + CD for my husband. He was very happy with the surprised but unfortunately all we got on the shipment was a DVD and NO CD :( We never received it with the shipment. I tried contacting and e-mailing to get the CD but had no luck except a response to contact the third party of where the shipment came from. It was very frustrating and I am very disappointed that I was never able to get the CD as its advertised by AMAZON but never got help.
5,Newgrass meets Dispatch,"What a great thing that mainstream country stations put a cut from this on the air, or else I would never have heard of these guys. It can hardly even be called progressive ""country""; wonderful stuff: great musicianship, catchy vocals. Feel good music that you dance to driving down the street. Ryan Shupe and the Rubberband's style calls to mind Dispatch, which is not a bad thing in my book, with a sprinkling of The David Grisman Quintet to boot. If you are a traditional country fan, this isn't for you, but if your tastes run across the board, this should be your next CD!"
3,Can't listen to it.....,"I was excited about this cd as I sat down to load it on my ipod. When it wouldn't load, and I confirmed that the problem was not with the ipod, I gained firsthand knowledge of protected music. I paid for it, yet can't listen to it in the manner that I normally listen to music---can't listen on the bus, the plane or while I'm out for a run. And this is progress? A victory for the music industry?This is the last cd that I will purchase for a very long time."
2,Good Music - Lousy Use Policy,"The music is pretty good. I'd give it 3.5 stars... But, like many others, here I am displeased with the content use restrictions. I have a great CD player on which to play this CD. However, I would also like to have the freedom to listen to the tunes when I am working on my computer at home, at work, out on a jog, etc. I was hoping to use one of the songs in slide show I am compiling for a famliy function. All of these are legal, personal uses. But, no way! This is the most NON-user friendly album I have ever owned (I wish I could take it back). I will never buy another Ryan Shupe/Rubberband product. I understand wanting to protect your work, but the heavy restrictions on the way one may use the CD are nonsense."
2,Difficult to find additional canisters,"Black & Decker Vacuum sealer, VS1300Product seems to work ok and is very comopact however, it is difficult to find additional canisters for sale - none of the other type canisters seem to work. I received this as a gift but had I been buying one for myself I would have chosen differently. Only time will tell if the 2 canisters I have hold up with continued use."
5,good value.,great set and an incredible deal for the price. especially like the size of the serving bowl. have a family of 5 and this has become our every meal set.
2,"Good card, Crummy support","I bought the card and discovered that they shipped it without the drivers it needed. I found Computer Geeks completely unresponsive, and it took most of a weekend searching the net to finally find that the only thing available was generic chipset drivers from Oxford Semiconductors. (Thanks, Oxford) (expletive deleted, Computer Geeks)"
2,Talks too much but ok workout,Workout ok but she talks WAY too much and it's distracting. You can mute her but then have to memorize the different moves throughout the video. Instructors should give an intro w/ suggestions instead of talking throughout the video - we only need to hear them once!
4,Yum!,"Loved the tea - a refreshing mixture of my two favorites, Licorice and Mint. Perfect for a little relaxation time!"
2,Not Worth Buying,"This book is not worth buying. Although it does contain scientific research, it's principals are very basic and are vague. They base the book around seven essential principals: encourage, mentor, celebrate, rehearse, protect, communicate, and guide. These principals are what every parent does normally. It also breaks down by age how to use these principals, but you can find this in any child care book. It's too expensive for what it talks about.[...]"
1,Nouveau Roman Debunked,"The message in this novel is pretty straightforward - don't wait to be meet compelling characters, be regaled with an engaging story, or be astounded by incomparable depth of insight. Instead, be prepared to be stupefied beyond comprehension. If this novel is to exemplify the tenets of the nouveau roman novel, it is abundantly clear why this particular form died at the starting gate. Note to all writers and aspiring writers: character, story and depth are not optional elements in a novel but essential to its viability."
3,Interesting story of a watch salesman and a murder.,"This is a story of a strange (he collects string) and veryobservant watch salesman and a murder. At first, the readerisn't sure if the salesman witnessed the murder. It alsoseems strange that if he did witness the murder, why is hemore concerned with selling his watches? As the storydevelops, the facts unfold with chilling clarity"
2,"If you liked it in English, read it in French!!","If this book doesn't disturb and confuse you enough in English, go ahead and read it in French. We did. This is by far the most confounding book we have happened upon during our college careers. The story line, or lack thereof, throws you for a loop, assuming you don't get lost in the cinematic language. We left this book feeling dumber than when we started. Bon chance!"
3,"Not Marlowe's Best, But Still Interesting.","I do not feel this matches Marlowe's ""Faustus,"" ""Massacre At Paris,"" ""Dido Queen of Carthage,"" or ""Edward II."" But it does have some memorable features. At first, Barabas is a sympathetic character, but like many of Marlowe's characters, he goes too far and becomes detestable. Barabas' daughter Abigail is a striking figure. She initially feels sorry for her father but later sees what he has become and falls victim to her father's wickedness. Her death as a Christain in 3.6 is memorable. Ithamore is convincing as a villain who knows no honor. Ferneze is fine as the hero who eventually restores order. It's not Marlowe's best play, but it is still worth some interest."
3,Mediocre,"I use this phone mainly for the speakerphone feature (for conference calls). My review is purely based on the base unit since I did not hook up the cordless handset. For this price, I expected a good speakerphone but it'll only pick up my voice when I'm talking within 2 feet. I've tried several speakerphones, and I thought I found what I need in this but was disappointed. Bought it at Staples for $150 and planning to return it, and get a cheaper phone (value for money). Features that I liked about this phone are the caller-id, and mute feature. Overall this phone is ok, but not for the price I paid for."
1,Already broken,"The item worked well for two days. We were very happy with it. Then, it broke. I should have listened to the other reviews and not taken a chance. Will not be purchasing another item from this manufacturer."
1,Broke after one week,The putting partner worked fine for one week until the mechanism that triggers the ball-return broke. The piece is so small that it's impossible to fix and it's now useless.
5,Great product!,"I ordered this product on Oct.4 and received it the next day in the mail. There are eight audio cds that came with the package. All of them are in perfect condition. Not a scratch on any of the cds. There was no advertisement for a book that came along with the cds but I wish there was so I could follow along but that's just the way I learn. The speaker on the cd is clear, precise and no mumbling! Yes! In the first hour that I opened the box, I have already learned the numbers up through 100! The product is just as advertised. Fast and easy learning. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!"
5,Outstanding blending of contemporary and native rhythms!!!,This album is a colaboration of Robbie Robertson and several Outstanding Native American singers and musicians. The melodies blend the gruff style and voice of Robertson together with the hypnotic chants and sounds of the Native American culture. Mesmerizing!!
4,Better than Nakai IMHO,"This CD has long held an honored position in my CD collection, and believe me, I have a lot of CD's. There are songs on this CD that just screamingly beg to be played at top volume, just so you can **FEEL** the drum beats and the intensity with which these players perform.I've caught myself singing some of the lyrics from songs on this album when it hasn't been in for weeks. Since I write music reviews and therefore listen to a LOT of music, this says that not only are they catchy and well defined, they have an impact behind them that is not readily or easily understood.I was *really* surprised to see negitive reviews on this one, as it's one of MY favorites, but you know what they say about opinions, everyone's got one, don't they??"
2,mind numbingly repetitive,"Surely the Pet Shop Boys were bowing to record company pressure to release this. These mish-mash remix albums WERE popular at the time, to be sure. I even bought a copy ( I must admit I buy everything PSB release ). But these song snippets rarely last long enough to get into the groove of the remix ( two to four minutes , tops ) before they are pulled out again. And the repetitive beats just bludgeon the listener until the entire cd becomes one long mind numbing mess. Compared to Disco ( which was a radical idea for its time, an entire album of remixes from one act, from one album - Please ) and Disco 3 ( a great album in its own right , as it contains several new songs as well as remixes of recent songs ) Disco 2 cannot be considered worthwhile. If I owned a Stairmaster ( which I do not ) I might listen to this. Otherwise it sits, lonely, on my shelf."
3,Only Edible if...,"It tasted really bad to me with just water. With skim milk it is alright. The bavarian chocolate is quite good, even with just water. The vanilla also needs skim milk to liven the taste."
2,"INTERESTING, BUT........","This small, oblong work is interesting, but many of the color reproductions are also used in Bret Norton's other books - the color reproductions are just OK considering the inexpensive nature of the book. I think that there are better books on the subject matter - i would not have purchased this book had i seen it in person beforehand."
3,"Interesting, but not good enough","You can feel the tensity and imminent horror at hand. I think the author did a good job here.The revelation of the first of the 2 mysteries of the book, the whisper, is suprising but reasonable.The 2nd mystery, the fear of the daughter, is a little far reaching and hard to comprehend.I feel the major characters of the story less likable. At the beginning you have every reason to be touched by the love between the father and daughter. But reading through you will doubt it. The daughter basically watches and lets her dad to fall without trying to rescue him, just to protect her secret. The dad got mad and suspecious at the daughter under the manipulation of the enemy, too easily in my opinion.If you haven't read the 'woman in white', I would recommend it. These 2 books fall in the same category, and you can tell a masterpiece from an OK work."
1,not what is shown in the pic,The tooth brush is different from what is shown in the pic. not a good buy.
4,Not the version I'd heard on the radio,I love the songs that are on the CD but Rock Me Amadaus and Calling Vienna aren't the versions that played on the radio stations and I liked those better. The rest of the songs are fine.
2,Yo Yo Yo Yo,"First off I could never love you, you sound like a richey rich yo smoke you. Lets just say the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because Falco was a money makin player who never saw it comin. What can i say Rock me marmaduce. But if you do like this CD then check out some other (...) CD's like Disneys premEARS, Slipknot, maybe even a little Blue man group. Peace"
3,Funny coffee table or bathroom reading book.,"This book is short, but funny. It outlines some of the most quirky names ever held. Some of these include T. Hee or Newton Hewton. A classic if you are a somewhat obscure person. I loved it."
5,Good overview,"I'm a fairly skilled amature photographer, so I wasn't looking for a strict ""how-to"" book - which this book is definately NOT. However, it provides great suggestions, ideas, and inspiration. It was a great review of techniques - like using the camera's panarama program for a vertical shot - that I probably knew but haven't thought of in a while. Covering such a wide range of photography situations, from macro shots to panaramas, this book is a great overview of techniques for all kinds of situations. I highly recommend it, especially if you're doing a shoot that is, for you, a bit unusual."
4,Photograph the leading the bestly,"100 ways are practical valid, suit me fine in photograph the teaching fulfillment usage."
3,Picture is not what you get,"I hope This helps all future buyers The KX-TS105B is probably a very good phone but this seller Has mislead all potential buyers by using a picture that shows the Panasonic phone attached to a CS55h Plantronics System Which is a $200 wireless phone system. I was going to buy the AT&T(1856)or(2909) But choose this because how could i pass up a wireless headphone system sold as a bundle but what i received was a KXTCA60 WIRED HEADSET and the KX-TS105B. ""DONT BELIEVE THE PICTURE IT IS THE PHONE BUY ITSELF"" There is no attachment connected to the left side of the KX-TS105B if you want whats pictured it cost around $200,usually the fine print is on contracts but this time its on the picture and you must enlarge the picture with your mouse to see notes. Seller should be honest and use picture of what you get in this box not items that are compatible with product."
5,Recommend this,"This product is all it says it is. We've been very pleased with it's performance and options. It's a ""plug and play"" operation. It's an important instrument to have if the area in which you live is prone to power outages as we are. A direct plug-in phone is all that works when the power goes out. All of our cordless phones are uselss. I even bought a headset plug-in and it sure makes long calls easy on the body. Relax and talk. Highly recommended phone."
4,Good solid home office equipment,"The Panasonic KX-TS105B is one of the sets listed as compatible with the Plantronics CS55H headset, which is one of the reasons I chose this phone for my home office setup.Plantronics CS55/HL10 Wireless Headset BundleOne element of that compatibility is how well the handset lifter (Plantronics HL10) fits on the phone. On the KX-TS105B, it works perfectly. I haven't yet used the speaker phone, so I can't comment on sound quality, but it's fairly simple to program speed dial buttons and works reliably. One thing I like about it is that it does not require an electrical outlet -- it takes 3 AA batteries."
3,TS 105 Speakerphone,Phone works as advertized. Sound quality is great when using speakerphone. Sound is poor on handset.
1,5 Month Death,"We have only had this phone 5 months and it quit working. It caused all the phones in the house not to work until we unplugged this phone. We thought maybe it just needed new batteries. The batteries in it still showed good but changed them anyway. A week later I tried to use the phone and again there was no dial tone. Went immediately to unplug this phone and again other phones in the house fine again. We were later told by friends they had been trying to get a hold of us for days. Bad buy, very unreliable product."
4,Good Simple Phone,"Phone works well. It is good as it needs no power cable. Only thing I would prefer is if you could press ""speaker"" and then dial rather than having to actually pick up the phone to dial."
3,Phone - 5 Usability - 2,"I work from home, and needed a speaker phone and a phone with a head set jack. The Panasonic KX-TS105B has both. The phone works fine. Unfortunately the designer decided that gray numbers on a black background looked cool. They may look cool on the drawing board, but when the phone lives on a small desk not in direct light, the numbers are really hard to read. The white letters (much smaller size) on my black keyboard next to the phone are easy to read.So I ask you Panasonic, why gray??? What were you thinking???"
2,People can't hear me when I use the handset....,"I use this phone for a call center at home. When I use my headset at work, people hear me fine. When I have to use the hand held phone receiver, people can't hear me at all. I would LOVE to return it and get another one, but I can't wait for a new one and I don't know what the return policy is. Oh well."
3,Phone just ok.,"The phone looks nice but the speaker-phone doesn't work well at all. The people we're speaking to can't understand us so we end up not using that feature which was why we bought this phone to begin with. If you don't need the speaker phone feature, you'll probably be satisfied, but I wouldn't recommend it as I believe all the features of an item should work well."
1,NOT A DURABLE MACHINE,I got this machine purely for the speaker phone function: on my home office desk. In such a short duration the speaker phone button has stopped working.It will work if I use it during a call placed via hand held part. Disappointed. And can not return.
2,Won't hang up,"I have this phone in my home office. Maybe have a defective phone, but when I answer and the call is for someone else, and they pick up on another telephone in the house, this one will not hang up. So, I can still hear the conversation and Sometimes it will disconnect when I unplug it and then replug the phone line. Usually I end up having to just unplug the phone and plugging it back in when they hang up. No other phones have this problem, just this Panasonic. I have had the phone a little over a year and it started doing this about 8 months ago. It works fine when it is just me in the house and I like the headset plu. Otherwise it is an okay phone."
5,Solid Product,"This is a very solid phone. The speaker phone is superior to any I've seen in a home phone. Also, easy to plug in headset."
3,eh.. not really what I was hoping for,"The phone is sturdy and quite serviceable, but I was disappointed to note that there is no caller ID or display of any sort. Given the current state of technology, I feel like it's kind of overpriced. Had I noticed it's overt lack of features I would have spent the extra $20 for the digital desk top unit with extra cordless hand held."
4,...just two things,"This is very nice phone for the price. Two things could be improved: it could have a call-waiting screen but more importantly, the keys should be lighter to the touch. You really have to PRESS the keys. But I would buy it again and the price was great."
4,"good phone,good price",This phone has a lot of good features and has excellent voice quality. It is also a very reasonably priced wired phone. I feel I need to keep a wired phone as an alternate to our cell phones.
2,Worked ONLY with AA Batteries,It was a great phone but i really hated the fact that it ONLY used AA batteries. I would have preferred if it had a power cord as well.
2,Usefulness,"I bought this phone because of its usefulness in taking service calls on the phone with the headset. The price was good enough and it was basically all I needed it for. Well, the headset works well, but the phone is to utilize the speakerphone button when using the headset, it does it sporadically, and of course that won't work when taking calls over the phone. For the phone quality, it's okay for using it for personal calls, but don't expect it to work for business calls, you may be better off looking elsewhere."
3,I got a bad set!,"I put a set of these strings on a Martin HD28 and immediately realized something was wrong. They had a very ""metallic"" sound. The third string was especially bad. I put on a different set of strings and all was well. I have always used Martin strings and never experienced a problem before."
5,Best CD Pruchase of the Summer!!!!!!!!!!!,"As a former MPEOPLE fan I became reaqauinted with them with the advent of Napster, the world of MPEOPLE at my fingertips...FREE!! My reunion is only saddened by the realazation that they are no longer together as a group, fear not because this album will certainly fill the MPEOPLE void, Smalls' compilation is clearly not as ""dancy"" as the nostalgic ""M""'s sound but she pours her soul into these compelling ballads, I think some of the best M songs were those with deep rooted emotional and social ties like Fantasy Island, Dreaming and RedFlower sunset, if you liked those M peices, givet his album a shot. She of course includes the Proud cut from the Queer as Folk soundtrack. Heather sings with an emotional sternghth that can come close only to her work on the MPEOPLE albums, you will become addicted to this collection of fine work which is written and produced by her. Happy listening."
1,Misleading and slow....wouldnt recommend,"Not ONE trojan in the ""variety pack"" Just a bunch of no name brands, and 2 durex, whoopie!Very misleading. Get your protection somewhere else.Shipping took well over a week."
4,Good filters,I have a salt water fish tank. Good filter. Last longer then the 30 days as recommended. Keeps the tank very clean and clear.
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","While some of the information is useful, this is essentially that nightmare of textbooks with which all of us are at some time or another saddled: a fascinating subject presented in the most dry, uninteresting and monotonous fashion possible. If you're into that kind of book, indulge in some stale crackers and brackish water as this book lobotomizes you page by page by page."
1,They should be recalled!,"Beware when the rollers melt in this printer, get prepared to buy a new one because it can't be fixed unless by Hewlett Packard. The problem with these printers as I said before is that this product has a defect. My 540 HP printer still works after 11 years. In that printer, I have used paper that is 20 years old, stapled, and used before without any problem. If it jams, I can always pull it out without permanently damaging this printer. Unlike the 1300n, I have seen melted rollers and it is very difficult to repair without spending more money on it than I have too. But my workplace has only these printers and they are the biggest waste of money unless your employers want you not to use less paper and print less. So think about and a laser jet cartridge costs about $150.00 too. I'll stick with the inkjet like my 540."
5,Fine series of Canterlot-centered episodes,"These are five episodes that leave the mane cast's usual stomping (stampeding?) grounds of Ponyville in favor of the royal capital of Canterlot; well, except for the one set on 'Hearts and Hooves Day'. For some reason they're done in reverse order, with the final episodes of season 2 (the Royal Wedding) done first and then running back through Hearts and Hooves (the Cutie Mark Crusaders try to set their teacher up with Big Macintosh and discover that messing with magic potions is a bad idea); Sweet and Elite (Rarity tells a few little white lies about her friends to get in good with Canterlot aristocracy; what could possibly go wrong?); and The Best Night Ever (the Mane Six attend the Grand Galloping Gala and find out the hard way they dreams may not measure up to reality).Great, fun, well done and entertaining for kids and adults alike, this is a very fine introduction to My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic."
5,Pony lovers,I bought this movie for Christmas for my four year old and it was the first one that went in the DVD player. My daughters loved it and thinking of purchasing a different one.
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I'm a Brony and absolutely love MLP. This DVD is a wonderful addition to my collection. If you like MLP as well, buy this or wait 'til Season 2 comes out on DVD."
3,"Good compilation, really only wanted one song.","I bought this CD for the ""Mack the Knife"" adaptation by Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Buffett. It was not possible to find the single available on its own, so at least the price of the whole CD wasn't too much. The other songs aren't bad, but I wouldn't have gotten them if I didn't have to."
2,Money maker only... don't expect art.,The Chairman past his prime with a lot of mismatched duets. It's clear this was produced as a last effort to make a lot of money for the artists. Art this is not.
5,Insightful,Provoking and written with exquisite skill. The book may help to inspire a new perspective about the world and your relationship with it. Read it.
5,Great CD in the car!,"I have an 18 month old who usually hates her 1/2 hour commute to and from daycare. Every morning when we get in the car, she immediately asks for ""Barney"". She is so happy now in the car, I actually don't even mind listening to it! We've listened to it so much, she now sings to all the songs and knows where they are on the CD!"
4,Fun Music,"This is a really great soundtrack to listen to and sing along to at home or in the car. I really enjoy all of the different songs and artists. The movie is sweet, too."
3,Missing some wonderful music!,"This movie is now one of my all time favorites! I only wish I could say the same about the soundtrack. I, too, would like to know what happened to the songs by Jewel and Frank Sinatra. Bonnie Hunt and her other arrangers and producers must have had some very big legal hurdles to conquer for them NOT to include theses two songs! And Joey Gian.......OH MY GOD!!!! What a voice!! He could croon me anyday!! I would LOVE to have some of his music. If anyone knows where to find some of his music, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE let me know where to find it. Overall, this CD is good but it could have done without ""Danny Boy""."
5,"Dean Martin and Jackie Gleason ""Return to Me""","The 1950s-feeling ""Return to Me"" is brilliantly soundtracked in this CD. One can easily see Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in the roles of Bob and Grace, and this soundtrack proves that you don't need tacky baselines or a cheap synthesizer to make music beautiful again."
4,Very Good Guitar!,"I am very pleased with this gutiar. The sound is surprisingly good, and it is built well. The wood seems a little thin but it may just be me; the finish is nice. It is easy to tune, and after about an hour of initial tuning (stretching out the new strings and what not) it has stayed in tune ever since.I haven't played guitar in a while and I wanted to revisit the instrument. This is a great guitar for the price, and it sounds like a much more expensive guitar."
4,Nice Reunion,This production made a good attempt to bring back the ole magic one last time. Great seeing all those characters again.
4,Would you believe a crappy transfer hurts this solid Get Smart reunion?,"This 1989 TV special is in the spirit of the original show. All the main characters are back (except Ed Platt) and the writing is in the style of the show. A lot of the jokes and situations are from the original series, but that's good because it works.What doesn't work is the lack of attention paid to this transfer to DVD. The poor picture quality really hurts the watchability of this DVD. Unfortunately the customer will have to tweak their TV's colors and brightness to approximate the original broadcast image. The VHS tape of this special had much better image quality. burn that to DVD and use the cover from this product. Or play the DVD on your computer with color-correction software."
3,Not bad. Not great.,"I needed a solution to a dimly-lit keyboard situation and ordered the Irocks Illuminated keyboard (Mac). The feel and function of the keys is excellent. It's compact, but as another reviewer has stated, there are no sound volume keys. I also miss having a USB port on the keyboard itself. The backlighting is a good solution in theory, but the problem with this keyboard's design is that the key mechanism creates a dark spot in the center of each key. The characters on the keys are offset a bit, but are still within the shadow area. The illumination of the keys might have been enhanced if the plastic used to make them was a translucent milky white instead of clear."
1,surpisingly specifically bad,The most effective way to illuminate a keyboard is light through the letters only...This keyboard is the opposite of that and is quite a shoddy design for keyboard illumination...Otherwise it's ok...I would be embarrassed if i designed this keyboard.
2,Panasonic KX-TG2258S E3 fix,"Thank you very much for your reviewsI have now fixed that E3 problem, do to reading all the reviews."
1,Dont use this phone for important calls,"This is a sleek looking phone with many good features. However, the PANASONIC BATTREIES are horrible. At first I could use my phone for about 45 minutes before the battery went dead. Adding to the frustration was that the battery indicator showed full capacity until the last minute when it showed that it needed recharging. After about a year the battery has gone even worse. I now get approximately 2 minutes talk time and 48 hours plus recharge time. In short - dont get this phone!!"
1,POS POS POS POS POS,"I travel a lot so I am never home therefore this phone got very minimal use, it completely died aftr only one year with a small amount of use. No more panasonic Anything for me!"
1,This piece of crap needs to be recalled!! E3 error!!!,"What a piece of junk. We've had this phone for over a couple years now and have tolerated the phones annoying way of changing channels on it's own, while you are talking!!! So you miss 4 or 5 seconds while the phone changes channels, thus you constantly have to ask people to restate what they just said. Then, just like many other on this board had said- if the power goes out this sucker is a gonner. E3 and flashing lights, that's all I get after a brief power outage. And I have the surge protector in place for both my phone and my computer. My computer is fine. My phone? FRIED! If you have to give a gift to someone you don't like, say for a family birthday- get them this phone! For yourself, you'd be better off with two tin cans and a string."
4,Classic NO This CD gos under the radar but people should check it out,These Murder INC cds Had crazy or Krazy from Breather life or I shed tears for the world he is a very lyrical rapper and the rest of the crew can flow it has a female MC but she's pretty good i'm not a huge fan of women rappers.
5,Important Resource for Men's Image,"I have been to the bookstores in search of a book that would enable me to understand, in layman's terms, the steps it takes to achieve a professional image. I especially liked the chapter on suits and ties and how to wear them. For years I was wearing my tie at the wrong length and wondered why people seemed to be looking at me! What a resourceful and practical book. I highly recommend it to every man who wants to enhance his image."
4,Sweet Jazz Music,"Well I dont listen to Jazz very much. I actually bought this CD because Frank Klepacki (the Drummer) is my favorite artist, who is the Senior Composer for Westwood Studios, a video game developing company. I took Jazz in High School a year ago and have a taste for it, and I really liked the CD. Jordan Robins has a unique voice that I cant compare to anyone. The reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because, well, 5/5 would be prefect, and I dont think it excited me THAT much, but it deserves recognition. Summed up: If you like Jazz, buy it, you wont be dissapointed."
4,Works great if you know what you are doing,"Lots of people bashing this product. It works just fine for me - but then again I understand that the resolution output for the ""second screen"" must be one that is compatible with a TV. Otherwise you will get the blank screen or one that is full of lines..Don't let incompetence rule your judgment about a product.Update: The RCA jack on this has never really worked consistently but the S-video has worked flawlessly. The RCA jack has stopped working completely now. I will have to get a S-video to RCA adapter for my current application of this adapter.Sounds funny, an adapter for an adapter but whatever makes it work for me.I reduced my initial 5 star to 4 star because of the RCA jack failing."
1,This item DOES NOT work!,The description of this item is too vague owing to the fact that now I know I need a VGA video card on my computer. I purchased this item in hopes of connecting my wife's laptop to her TV but it totally failed! I even tried my Dell tower with the same result. The seller needs to clarify the fact that this item only works if combined with a VGA video card.
3,Too big!,"I got my puppy (about 20lbs) a large costume because she wears a large in every Petco shirt. The sizing chart on the website was slightly vague, and I did measure from her head to her tail. When I recieved the costume (which came in about 2-3 days) it was so big on her, she was stepping on the feet, and the stomach was dragging on the ground. Now she is a small framed dog, but this was rediculous. Then in the actual package, they had a sizing chart with examples of dog breeds, and what size they would wear. Well, had I known that before, I would have gotten a Medium! And I couldn't send it back for a smaller size because it was right before Halloween. So I ended up saftey-pinning the costume to fit her better. It worked out okay, but you try holding a puppy still long enough to put safety pins all down her. The material itself was good, and I would have loved it...had it been in her size :("
3,not very..,didn't find this book all that useful. the contents were about as good as any kendo books that's out there. i would stick with 'this is kendo' and pick up rest from the dojo.
5,Loved it,"I am a die hard Earth, Wind and Fire fan. I always wanted to see this movie. While E,W & F won't get any Oscar's for acting it was entertaining none the less."
1,THE WORST MOVIE OF THE DECADE,"Ok, I really put myself through some abuse watching this movie. Whoever directed this movie, Chris McQuarry or whatever his name is, needs help. He REALLY needs help! This movie is a piece of garbage. You got Bencio Del Toro he's sleepwalking through the movie. You got Ryan Phillipe he's jumping on shards of glass for money. Worst of all you got a plot nobody can understand. Am I getting through to you! The best thing to do, if anyone asks you to watch this movie- RUN, RUN VERY FAST. If you really like action, check out Mission: Impossible 2. The special effects are brilliant. Everyone should see that movie!"
1,Horrible,"Usually even with a bad script, you can't go wrong with a high calibre cast. Taye Diggs, Benicio, James Caan, Juliette Lewis... all some of my top actors. But even so, McQuarrie manages to mess this one up. I blame the direction moreso than the storyline. I think the storyline could have been fixed with better direction. As presented, the story was very hard to follow not only in terms of cohesiveness but also in being able to keep my interest. I only watched it to the end out of sheer curiosity. I can't recall in recent memory seeing a movie with such potential fall on its face. Oh wait, there's Kill Bill 2 which actually is better than this one. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Instead do what I did and watch ""Eight Heads in a Duffel Bag"" which also was better than this one!"
4,Not The Usual Suspects,"This freshman effort by writer/director McQuarrie deserves a look, especially if one likes the 'caper gone wrong' sub-genre. It ranks with scuh films as 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Sexy Beast', 'Confidence' and 'The Hot Rock' (but not quite as good as Pulp Fiction). Although the secretive interconnectedness of the characters is pretty easy to decipher -it will be impossible to ascertain their fates. Moreover, there is no authentic protagonist in the film (even Philippe and Del Toro cannot be thought of as your average run-of-the-mill 'anti-heros'). McQuarrie really seems to channel Peckinpah in establishing the overall mood of the film (particularly with the 'Mexican-standoff' scene and with the ridiculously violent, funny, and extremely profane opening. Also, if you're are a fan of 'bells' and 'whistles' that DVDs have over VHS, the extra features option enables the viewer to witness a never filmed storyboard scene you'd wish they had actually put on film."
5,awesome,this movie has everything a man needs in a movie. and everything a girl needs too. why cause its awesome and if you dont like it your wrong
3,Worth what I paid for.,"This movie is for the typical ""shoot 'em up"" fans out there. I'm not going to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it. If you like Benecio Del Toro in one of his better roles, watch this movie. Nice story, action, and screenplay. Sarah Silverman plays as a guest role (hilarious scene)."
2,Was recommended to me.,"Very action oriented movie with even more profanity. Let's just say it's not a kids movie. Not my kids anyway. It was recommend due to the real to life tactical aspects of the fight scenes. I haven't decided whether I will finish it. Yes I know in real life some people swear ""a lot"" but that doesn't mean I hang with them."
3,Great Ambition,"This film was made with a huge ambition. The filmaker wanted to make a film that would be a huge story, but somewhere along the way he messed things up a little. The story revolves around to kidnappers, Phillipe, and the great Benicio Del Toro, and their plan to kidnap a surogate mother to collect the money that she will receive for having this child. The plot hits a few snags when the mother, played by the ever annoying Julliete ""the other sister"" Lewis enters. All the actress does is yell about everything. This acting style gets on every last nerve after her first five minutes. The gun play is probably the loudest i have ever heard in a movie. The film starts off incredible, with a hilarious altercation at a night club, then the film starts to drift into trouble with the rest of the plot, and how to get the movie to go along at an even pace."
4,BAD ASS,"Shadow's Fall are really bad ass.Brian Fair is like a young TomAraya,he's got a really good vocal range.The guitar players getsome really good pounding and fast riffs going and get some killer solo's.Good drumming to,Shadow's Fall are just plain andsimple a very kick ass unit.I can't get enough of Stepping out-side the circle,Destroyer of Senses,Idiot Box,e.t.c.This bandalong with Killswitch Engage,Sworn Enemy,Chimaira are taking theU.S.A style of heavy metal and branishing it all over the place.But although this band is very good and raw they're not heavy tothe point of annoying like death metal with the exception of SixFeet Under and Obituary.Bands like Cannibal Corpse,Deicide,MorbidAngel all suck ass.Stick to the new wave of american metal butalso stick to the classic metal like Slayer,Pantera,Fear Factory,and early Sepultura.Stay clear of nu-metal like Korn,Limp Bizkit,Linkin Park,Sevendust,Disturbed,all that crap and the death metalwoth the exception of SFU and Obituary."
5,Old School Metallica in modern day,This cd is amazing simply put. I never really listened to it when I first got it but all of a sudden I have started listening to it a lot. The guitar solos remind me of metallica and the rest of the music is fast paced with the occasional ballad or slow part in a song or two. Everything seems to mesh pretty well and you will find that you cant sit still or not sing along when listening to this cd. This cd is well worth the money and they are even better live. Check it out and support the metal world today.
1,crap :(,this umbrella was a gift to my golfer husband...the very first time he used it turned inside out and blew away...it broke from blowing around..i should have returned it but the package was so big i didn't save it and didn't know how to ship it back....definitely a bad purchase...i would recommend buying a huge umbrella at sam's or costco and not deal with shipping it back when it breaks
1,Do NOT by this.,This DVD is the worst DVD I have ever seen. Nothing that you can learn at all. It is just a woman masturbating. No techniques. Not instruction. Just her. What a waste. I can't belive people would buy this.I will warn you now: Don't waste your money on it.
2,midget,"This drum set is for midgets. Just look at the sizes of the drums! Get a real drum set,don't waste your money on this toy. Afterall, it IS bought in a toy store..."
1,do not buy first act,"first act products are all really cheap, they suck, the quality is very poor if you are looking for something with even a little bit of quality do not buy this set"
3,NOT a Samsung product,"This cartridge has been working just fine for us, but you should know that in spite of the picture of a Samsung box, this is NOT a Samsung brand product. The only place the box or the cartridge mention Samsung is for stating compatibility. I feel I was mislead."
3,"Not OEM toner, Aftermarket","Toner is aftermarket (Not OEM(Samsung)). After printing plain text, the toner would smudge off or come off when rub against your finger."
3,Defective .,"This product was defective and it was promptly replaced with a new one. Thank you, for the excellent customer service."
4,Excellent price,I couldn't find a better price on the web for this product. It is working flawlessly.
5,Got a realoaded cartridge - not new - but it's OK,"But I contacted the vendor and he had mistakenly sent me the reloaded item. So he sent me another reloaded cartridge FOC. The original one he sent me is going strong!! At the price, one good cartridge was an outstanding deal but now I have two for that price. Sweet."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!!,"This is not a brand new cartridge. It shows up in what looks like a new box but has been opened and reglued from the bottom. The cartridge inside is a re-manufacutered unit, NOT new. TIGERSUPPLIES is ripping customers off!! I lost $20 with shipping as my shipping cost where not refunded and my shipping cost to return the item was not covered."
5,A Great End to a Great Series,"A fitting conclusion to an amazing series, even if it does deviate significantly from the Gundam canon."
4,Portable Halogen Worklight,"This light gives off enough light to lite your project. The only drawback is that it has an extremely short cord, gets very hot, and will not sit in odd work locations (bulky and ackward). For close quarters work, and preventative conditions described above, I would get a dfferent style work-light. Otherwise this is an ideal light to see your work project, and the price is ideal."
2,Problems w/ ink drying prematurely and not flowing well,"I have a Cross pen, and it USE to work great, when I originally bought it. However, ever since I got my first refill, it seems the pen would not flow quite as well after extensive use. I'd have to leave it alone for a while before it would start flowing well again. Don't know if it was the particular batch I got or what. I've opened one package and after this refill, I'll open another package. Hopefully, I just got a bad batch."
1,Terrible Phone,Had this phone for a couple of weeks. This phone is simply the worst phone we have ever owned. The voice quality on the handset is as bad as it gets and the people at the other end complain that we MUST be on the speakerphone (When we are not).This thing is going back.
5,Every woman needs to read this.,"This could be used for either a man or woman and is one of the best books ever written revealing the hidden pain that seeks to destroy a person. Everyone should read it even if they have not had to be treated for depression. It gives clear insight into the ugly battle that occurs and most importantly, hope for overcoming the depression and the victory over it."
1,book,"This book was recommended by Amazon after I ordered a psychology book. It is a totally religeous book which I have no interest in. I found it objectionable, simple minded and minimizing. It should be catagorized as religion and not psychology."
4,book is good,I just wish i would have bought the book form as my ereader does not always work and cannot afford new one. book is great.
4,Working Out with Weider,"The product has made improvements since the last time I purchased a similar unit. Time for assembly was lengthy (3 hours start to finish), but ease of use once assembled was flawless. I like the ability to change from one exercise to another in a relatively short amount of time, and there are no heavy weight plates! Some small fastener parts were missing due to shipping via UPS, box was heavily damaged but product inside was not."
5,Lice problem gone.,Our son brought home lice from school. We quickly did the recommended treatment and stopped the spread of the buggers. Was only in our son and the problem was gone in 10 days.
1,Cheap shoe,"Looked cute out of the box. The description said it was leather, yet when it got here it clearly stated on the shoe that it was made of ""man made materials."" Still, I kept them because they were cute and my daughter liked them. The sole separated from the upper in a few weeks and the shoe basically fell apart. Not worth the money."
2,"A few ""keepers""","I picked this up for $2 at a used book store, so I can't complain. Out of 14 tracks I have to skip about half of them. Over produced with poor production. Melanie sounds like she is singing in a distant barrel in a couple of songs. A European production that sounds like it was done in the '50s."
2,It Has It's Moments,"Melanie, the songwriter, is grossly under-rated. She is a prolific and exceptional songstress. Her vocal instrument, once her ace in the hole, has lost some of its range and power, at times she sounds as if she is growling. This cd contains nothing but covers. Melanie has done some exceptional covers in the past, ""Wild Horses"", ""My Rainbow Race"" & "" Chords of Fame"" come to mind. But, she covered those songs when she was in full command of her voice. "" Ain't No Sunshine"" is gorgeous and her voice is the powerful instrument it once was. But, most of these songs are buried under pretentious arrangements and sung in an almost monotone manner. She needs to invest in vocal training. Her voice is still there, but she doesn't know how to use it to its full advantage. The only cd, in recent memory, that serves Melanie well and showcases her tremendous talent is ""Crazy Love""."
2,"If you valued the 80's, don't buy this product","You'd think that an 80's anthology of music would understand that it caters to an audience which is nostalgic toward that decade.I give this two stars only because you can't take away from the 80's music, but I figure that the inane commentary on the CD booklet should be calculated in this rating too. It was highly unnecessary and insulting to 80's fans to include disparaging remarks about the decade and banal political commentary by obvious leftist sympathizers."
2,Super Reader,"This book has all the elements, a hero of sorts all muscly and armored, and a sneaky gorgeous sorceress that he must initially make a deal with her to enable him to overcome in a coming conflict.The Horned Helmet that she gives him does make him superpowered, hard to hurt, and all that, but very much has a touch of the Stormbringer about it, which he learns and has to struggle against.The writing just isn't too good, though."
4,"powerpuff gaming,inc","This game is cool my favorite quote of the level 1 intro is""this brick is sure to do the trick"" thats MOJO JOJO'Ssaying the game play is that you have to save townsville frommojo jojo...I like the powerpuff girls but i am 11 and i almost passed level 1 by 2003 i will be on level 2thanks cartoon network for the game"
5,Nice Hangers,I use these hangers as gifts by crocheting a lacy cover over them. I looked all over in my area but was not able to find nice padded hangers for my project. But I found them at Amazon. Great product and worked perfect.
5,WOW! this is awesome,"These folks not only have talent but they inspire you also. This CD has all original songs and they are great! For a freshman effort I can't wait to see what they have in store next. Move over CeCe and BeBe, Passage has God's blessing and it shows!"
2,It's OK,"Don't get me wrong--this isn't a BAD product, but it really isn't very useful, either. I find the dancers are fairly amusing for a while and the analog recorder makes a really easy way to record old tapes, but that's about it. Also, the recorder ONLY records in proprietary Micro$oft .wma format instead of offering a useful-for-editing format like .wav. Because of this, the only time I ever use it is when I am feeling lazy and I have it set my recording level for me.I would only recommend this product if:1. Like me, you can get it ""Free after rebates"" (don't forget about taxes and shipping). Don't even think about paying more than $5 (after taxes, etc) for it.2. You already know you like a certain feature (like the dancers)--don't get this hoping for something great because you will probably be disappointed3. You have a lot of extra space on your hard drive and4. You have a fast internet connection (Downloading dancers requires up to 20MB or more PER DANCER!)"
4,My Review,"This is a really great book! I love the whole series but I have to say that #6 The Challanger, is my favorite. This particular book is about Sam discovering a plot to wipe out the wild mustangs. She also finds out a lot more stuff about her mom, like the true story of how she died. The only thing that truy dissapointed me was that Sam and Jake still haven't gotten any closer to a relationship than they were in the first book. It's really quite annoying because they would be perfect together. But other than that, it is a great book and I really think you should read it."
1,Ponderous and pretentious,"It's rare that I finish a book and conclude that the author is a person I probably wouldn't like very much, but that's exactly what I experienced with ""At Paradise Gate."" When the characters in this humorless tale speak, they utter paragraphs at a time -- long, weighty diatribes of the sort that no one actually says (but which novelists apparently like to write). The narrator drops some real gems, too, like this one: ""Unsorted images crowded Anna's mind ... herself at her best, alone, looking, smelling, hearing, all her thoughts concentrated on the quality of light or air."" Now, what could this possibly mean? To me, it means ""no more books by Jane Smiley.""On the upside, the story offers good, solid three-dimensional characters. Unfortunately, they're not exactly likable, and their views on marriage and family are so dated as to be at times offensive, at times unintentionally funny. But not funny enough to justify picking up this foul fossil of a novel."
2,Think about the money,This game is ok. If you like easy games of course. It took me about 4 hrs to beat the entire game. Tony hawk took me a little over a week the first time without the strat guide to beat it with 1 person. I think it's just better to get Tony Hawk 3. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND RENT IT!!!
2,What was this guy thinking?,"Imagine coming home stressed out and wound up and needing to kick back with some mellow, fat guitar and your favorite libation. If you're searching the universe, or even this solar system for that matter, for relaxing jazz guitar music... well, this isn't it. Some fine musicians, no doubt and some good cuts, but the guy who named this cd must have lost track of the vallium he had just injested. What was this guy thinking? Want to relax? Try ""Joe Pass in Hamburg"" on ACT music, 1997. NOW you can relax, and you didn't even have to leave the planet."
5,Spotlight on Nancy Wilson,"This was my first 'spotlight on' Cd, and also my very first Nancy Wilson CD. This is absolutely wonderful, and have since then purchased many, many more Nancy Wilson CD's, and have been lucky enough to have seen her twice in concert!"
3,not as nice as expected but still functional,"This is a nice globe for the price. Not a big deal, but a nice gift especially for the holidays where each year you can change the picture to keep current. Now having said that, I am not happy with the customer service I received when one arrived leaking. It took a while to straighten out and while I paid postage to have it way before Christmas, by the time we resolved the bad globe and it was sent back regular mail coming after the holidays."
1,Useless,If you have the manual coming with the CD this book is practically useless except for the maps and some minor stuff. Want some really interesting data? Better download the unofficial WBC tome of knowledge from whe web.
4,My 6 year really likes this.,"My daughter does like this TOY. Remember it is toy not a high tech electronic device.The reason I like this toy is that it allows my daughter to play,create, imagine by herself as she creates ""masterpieces"". It did take her a few pictures before she got the hang of how the focus works. It is also insteresting to say how much detail she adds on her own.The reason my daughter says that she likes the projector is that she can make things that she wouldn't be able to by ""just using my hands""."
2,quite uneven,"This collection of short stories ranges from the dull to the decent. It is never awful or great but just o.k. I found most of the stories just ended, like maybe it was an idea for a novel that she discarded."
3,Keep the publication date in mind,"As a huge fan of The Haunting and We Have Always Lived in the Castle, I was left indifferent about this collection. ""The Lottery"" receives such high praise that I was expecting more when I got to the end. Perhaps in its historical context, it was more shocking, but now it fell flat much in the same way ""The Box"" by Richard Matheson did for me.However, it's still worth a read given its buzz and because it's so short. Jackson has an interesting and compelling writing style that makes the other stories at least intriguing. Obviously there are plenty of reviewers here who completely disagree, so hopefully you'll be fortunate enough to be one of them!"
5,One of my favorite short stories,"No suspense tale has ever impressed me as the Lottery did; I mean, what can be more innocent than a small town lottery? But then the author gives it a great twist when she turns it into a horrible, inhumane tradition. Just for the originality of the idea I give it two stars, and the other three are for being so well written, it's just chilling. By the way, I also saw the movie starring Keri Russell, which is OK, but of course, not even comparable to the quality of the actual tale."
4,Poison pills,"Like other students before me, the only thing by Shirley Jackson I had read was ""The Lottery."", which has those virtues that high school teachers love: it has an obvious moral theme, and it is fairly short. I liked it then, and I like it now, but I liked the other stories in this collection more. Jackson had a tremendous eye for realism, and the way in which prejudice sneaks into virtually every human interaction. ""After you, My Dear Alphonse,"" is excellent, about the frustration and anger which arises when we are unable to exercise our virtues easily upon others. Some of these stories touch on social realities that still go largely unmentioned. Nor will you ever meet anyone named James Harris again without a slight twinge of excitement and caution."
5,Boot TCX X -Five Gore-Tex,"Spectacular, I made a trip 11.000km with this boot, under sun and rain cold and heat.But my feet always very comfortable and protected."
5,"Good boots, great value","They are comfortable, look good (for motorcycle boots), are waterproof after hours of standing in snow and slush (yes, I know they're not intended for shoveling snow off the driveway) and offer much more protection than construction or other type boots. Great value for the money."
2,"It Didn't Fit, And I Can't Send It Back!!",This ram card was described as PC100/PC133 but did not fit the card slot on the motherboard of my PC133 computer! I opened it and now I cannot send it back!
5,Good dance music that you know you heard.,This CD brings you the songs that you remember hearing and if yo have spent any time in Ibiza reminds you of why it is so much fun. The mix is great and the CD is one of the best of 2003.
3,Maybe or Maybe Not,"I'm not sure about this game. If its anything like DNA Factor of the GBA, it will not be worth the money."
3,GBC Home shredder,"Good shredder, but can not handle more than about 4 sheets at a time. For the price, is a good value."
2,slow shredder,we wanted a portable shredder we could easily store in the closet when not in use. This product meets that criteria but it is a slow shredder; I wish it was more powerful.
1,Bought as a gift,Sent to wrong address company INSISTS it was my error they could not havescrewed up. DO not expect any help from them Worst merchant I have ever delt with on Amazon
4,This cute book works on two levels.,"It is a sweet tale about dogs for children, explaining why puppies sometimes misbehave or act up. It has also been pointed out that if you transpose the word men for puppy and/or dog, it is quite amusing on another level, as a basic explanation on why men sometimes misbehave or act up."
3,Not bad at all...,"The only reason I don't give this album more star is because I only know of ""Symphony of Destruction"" from Megadeth's earlier material. So when I listened to this (being relatively new to metal myself anyway), I figured it would be fair to say that this is not a bad album. The opening track ""Reckoning Day"" is my favorite here, but this has some strong melodies and good musicianship. ""Train of Consequences,"" ""Youthanasia,"" ""A Tout Le Monde,"" and ""Blood of Heroes,"" are pretty good songs as well. Overall, I'd say this is a good metal album, though I still think of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin to be REAL heavy metal. What the hell, Mustaine and crew seem to have it going for them, so...not a bad album at all."
5,Youthanasia - An uderrated masterpiece,"I really don't understand why metal fans keep insisting in the useless paranoia speech of ""selling out"" every time a metal band releases an album who isn't bloddy 5000 beats per minute loud and noisy as their former ones! Let's face it, Youthanasia is one of the best Megadeth albums ever. Musically and lyrically speaking. The mood is heavier, though the pace is slower than Countdown or Rust. The guitars have been tune down half a step, so it contributes to that.Musically, it is a killer! Mustaine's both vocals and riffing are amazing, very well produced and Marty does well with some amazing soloing.Sure, it isn't as ""Megadethish"" as Peace Sells or Rust, but it sure as hell is a definite highlight in this outstanding band's carrer.""Addicted to Chaos"" is my favorite, but you can name every one of the songs in the album as quite good. Intricate, melodic, defying, dark and metalic. That sums up this masterpiece!"
3,It Has Historical Value But,The Korgis were one of the excesses of New Wave. How does one pigeonhole a quirky uninteresting band? Who cares? Best track is `Young And Russian'.
5,A Little Mislead,"I gave this 5 Stars because, heck, it is fun.. But I was a little mislead. Somewhere, I read that it was based on the adventures of Han Solo. Now, this guy's name is Trent.. Never mind..Anyway, cool game. Looks great, runs great.. Easy to get lost in space, though. I'd recommend it to people of old school flight games.. even though the mouse flight is a little difficult to get used to."
2,Not for Cockpit Jock oldtimers,"Visually, this game is extremely good. The freedom of the plot line will remind you of Privateer. However, once you get into the cockpit, it is not this same. There is no joystick support at all.If you enjoy first person shooter games, you will probably adapt to the mouse only interface pretty quickly and enjoy the game. However, if you are looking for more of a flight combat sim, you came to the wrong game.I don't want to be unfair. Everything else about this game is top notch. I just could not get over flying without the joystick and using my programmable buttons. Firing and manuvering was just too cumbersome and I was forced to return the game.If they ever added joystick support, I would definitely buy it again. In the mean time, I'll stick to my existing sims."
1,blah,"Let's just say, stay away from this game if you have a GeforceFx video card. It's not supported and even after you add it to the database manually (as told by the Microsoft tech support), the game locks up while loading. The tech support came up with over 15 ways to solve this problem but still it wouldnt work. and no, it's not because of my PC. I'm not the only one experiencing this problem. I visited the MS forum the other day and found that several other people were having the same troubles when playing this game with a GeforceFX. So just a warning to you all, DO NOT purchase this game if you own a GeforceFX...wait 'til MS releases a patch later in the future...if ever...This is yet another 'unfinished product' from Microsoft."
2,Freelancer a little HOLLOW,"I downloaded and played the Demo.. I thought great, what a kicka$$ game.. The storyline is great, the graphics are awesome if your video card is compatible or Recognized by the game(Radeon 9700 is not).. If not MAJOR BUGS from slow windows inside the game to rough game play!!! It only took 15hrs to beat single player mode, Multi-player [smells].. You have to restart a new character every time you play or change servers..You lose your money and ship!!! SO much for progress.. My system XP2500+ Nforce 2 Radeon 9700 1GB 333DDR.. Save your money for something else!!!..."
4,A little like GTA3 for outer space... except without the muggings,"This is what they truly mean by ""open-ended gaming"". Yes, you can lament the lack of multiplayer. You can also lament the too-short storyline (at least its longer than Call of Duty). You can even gripe about the lack of joystick interface (yeah, the mouse-only driving is what cost this review a star).But you cannot lament the range of ways to play this game. You can run with any group, any time, even the ones you've run missions against or just blown up and robbed (thanks to convenient bribes). There are a number of easter eggs to find (hidden joys), and quite a few sectors that don't get visited in the course of the plot, to give you something to do once you've beaten this game.While it does get repetitive after a while, most games do. I mean, you can only take so many approaches and kill so many targets before you're done and should really get some sleep, right?An excellent game. I wish they'd consider a sequel."
3,Not bad,"I have the demo version of the game, which is pretty comprehesive. I enjoyed the game a lot, but it isn't a very accurate sim. All the ships act the same, doesn't matter if it's a big freighter or a little fighter they are all the same in agility. The AI isn't very good either, they just are stupid what else can be said. However, the storyline is pretty cool and I like how it's laid out and how open ended it is. If they combinded Freespace and Freelancer you would have the best space sim ever created. Oh and I would give it 3 and a half stars."
2,A BIG let down,"Well after reading the overview of the game and all the positive comments, I was ready to buy the game. Luckily I downloaded the demo first. This a poor excuse for a flight simulator.You start off on a planet and you are told to go to the bar. I think, ""ok lets walk around and find one"". Lol, no walking allowed in this game, you just click the bar icon to go there. Want to talk to people in the bar, well click them and watch the cut scene.(Get use to them the game is filled with cut scenes versus exploring yourself)Once you get into space, then you have control. Well control over average quality graphics as you spins in circles with the shoot button held down :::yawn:::I'm sorry, but I'm deleting this demo and not buying the game after all. Its just a cheap game ment to get your money and take advantage of the no return policy on games :-P."
5,Dancing Arabs,"A wonderful insight into the world of the Israeli Arabs, not often afforded to Jewish Israelis.I enjoyed every minute of this book and was sad when I finaly finished it"
4,okay laser jet,"I was disappointed that there was no real paper tray, but I was pleased with the 8x10 prints I printed..600 dpi...I did not expect GREATness for $700...it assembled and installed easily...I am wondering what price is for printing a normal color photo...I picked this up at Costco on Impulse and so far am happy...as I had PC virus last year, never got my Epson installed again and I HATE buying ink cartridges and doesn't toner last a lot longer and is more durable? I hope to keep this printer! Also, I could not find the toner at Costco, a disappointment....would have liked to have known the price of it first..but the box said you got a sufficient supply in the beginning, that is a plus.."
2,Returned It.,"I bought it from a store, and this C.D. in my opinion wasn't good at all. WAsn't trance (which I was expecting)."
2,DON'T EXPECT ANY HELP FROM SWEATBAND-good for bad hair days,If you're buying this because you sweat alot--do not buy it. The sweat band is not what you expect- it's a piece of material about as thick as a man's dress sock. You sweat through and soak it at first signs of sweating. Good for bad hair day-but not good to keep sweat from forehead.
2,Quality less than expected,"I was disappointed in this product. True, it is advertised as ""lightweight,"" but I was stunned to see how little down it actually holds. Most of the baffle boxes had so little down in them, you could easily see daylight through the comforter when held in the air. On the ""warmth scale"" printed on the package, this one rates 2 out of 7. Wish they'd have added that critical information to the product description."
1,Feathers Everywhere!,"We've used this for about 1 year and are currently shopping for a new comforter. I normally expect to see a couple of feathers when using a down comforter. This is ridiculous though. The feathers work themselves out of the comforter very easily. Our bed, pajamas, duvet cover, bedroom are covered in feathers."
5,AMAZING,"Purchased for daughter away at college. In her words ""amazing, best sleep I have ever had. Wake up warm and toasty"""
4,Kept hands warm,These did the trick in the winter. They kept my hands warm even first thing in the morning when the steering wheel is so cold to touch.
1,that was fail,very pure quality leatherate. very bad lines. right hand glove was defected. lines are pure quality too. don't buy this gloves. you will lost money!
5,Cure Oil,I bought this after I had read of it's properties for many cures. I bought it specificall for toe nail fungus. I found it worked excellently withou my having to undergo a multitude of tests and trips to the podiatrist.
4,Intellegent and clear,"This is a well-written and clear book. I had been wondering about the whole ""tween"" talk in parenting circles. I hadn't understood why I was seeing some teen behavior in my nine year old child while she was still playing with toys. This book really laid out this transitional stage for me and in turn is helping me to better mother my daughter through this.There is solid child development understanding backing this book, and none of the bad attitude or pop psychology that is rampant in most books on tweens."
3,Worked but a hard fit,I like this for the price. It worked well but I did have to cut the edges to get it to fit into the filter area of the tank...and it was a bear to cut. I bought more though--because of the price and how well it did work.
4,Works well with the system,"We purchased the 3 gallon aquarium for my son's betta fish, Blowie the Scary. Blowie doesn't eat all of his food, and this filter does a great job of getting out the extra food and initial cloudiness when my son puts too much in. The filters are extremely easy to use and my 4-year old can change them himself. It's a really nice set, with easy filter maintenance and I'd recommend it. Sometimes it takes a day for the filter to clear enough out, but it's still high on my list."
4,Quality Release ... But Not The Hit Singles Versions,"Not a bad compilation if all you're looking for is a nice collection of Neil Diamond tunes. However, if you were hoping to get your hands on the 45rpm single versions of his many hits, keep looking. For, only by seeing the last couple of pages of the insert (following some 5 pages of background information written by Robyn Flans in 2004) of this Universal release do you see that all the selections are culled from his various albums.Using just 5 examples, the single release of Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show ran for 3:08 while the one here is extenbded to 3:27; Holly Holy - 4:27 - 4:40; Shilo - 3:43 - 2:57; He Ain't Heavy (He's My Brother) 3:59 - 4:11; and Cracklin' Rose (2:47 - 3:00.Some MAY indeed be the same as the single release, but there's nothing in the insert to enlighten you one way or the other.I'm holding out for an Ace of London, Jasmine, Bear Family or Acrobat treatment of his best singles hits."
4,Good Neil Music,"Love the CD and many of it's songs. Have a few songs w/audience clapping in the background, which is my only dislike (like just the pure music). Good quality sound otherwise.."
3,"Great play, very slim edition","I won't write of the play itself which I think is worth having and reading. Instead, a few words on this edition.You cannot beat it on price. Though sturdy, the book is bare bones. No introductions. No cast of characters. I even noticed a few typos. At least once, a speech is attributed to the wrong character. Were I buying this play in bulk for a performance or a reading, I'd buy this edition. For my library, I'd be less inclined."
4,Good stories well written,"A series of stories about young men, One a kid who plays baseball, another a young man bonding with a dog bond as he recovers from a broken leg, another a chance meeting between a group of blacks and a young man going home for a visit Each pulls you into the life of the subject. The stories are intimate. Written in the 1960's they also describe the relationship between blacks and whites at that time."
2,"UNWORTHY OF THE NAME: ""BRITANNICA""","At nearly 1200 pages, this book seemed promising. It boasts of a variety of 'archivable' information. But, the fact that its editors chose to include outdated statistics in it surprised me. Some of these data are more than fifteen years old!The compilers of ""Encyclopaedia Britannica"", (who also handled this Almanac), have access to one of the most current and the most versatile infobase in the world. And, I wonder why they refused to let this Almanac live upto its name.This inexplicable reason makes it hard for me to recommend this Almanac."
1,Almanac? Um...no.,"Unfortunately for people who have bought this worthless book, it's NOT AN ALMANAC. An almanac is supposed to have actual STATISTICS, this has close to zero. It's like a watered-down Encyclopedia Britannica, but if you want that, just get the new Encyclopedia Britannica Concise Encyclopedia (great deal, by the way). If you want a real almanac, I recommend the TIME Almanac. It has all the facts you could ever want, and is much easier to read and use than the competition."
3,So close and yet so far!!,"I adore strip poker and this dvd shows a bunch of babes playing strip poker, so why only three stars? Cos they don't take their pants off, that's why!!The whole set up is fantastic- girls betting their clothes, taking off items of clothing while pole dancing, undressing each other- until they get to the final hurdle and keep their little panties on!Buy it by all means but be aware that it should only be used as a starter before your main course of the evening."
1,The truth may be opposite,"Well, to me, it is more like white men are chasing Japanese women. Many yellow fevers come to Japan or other Asian countries. Why doesn't Kelsky focus on this?"
1,A serious dissapointment,"Based on the the many Japanese women with whom I've spoken, this book is largely inaccurate and, at most, ""based on a true story."" The author's sources are questionable, and her bias is obvious.Perhaps the only positive thing I can say about this book is that the historical references are informative, but if you are looking for a history of Japanese women, look elsewhere."
2,You Get What you Pay For,"I bought this on sale at Staples for $99. It was a disaster.I have always bought HP printers because they have been so reliable and well designed. This unit seems to be the exception. It smears ink all over the page on printouts, even after multiple cleanings. Sometimes a 20 page print job takes 20 minutes, someimtes five minutes. I don't know if I just got a lemon or if HP tried to pack too much into a small unit and all the units are prone to defective output.On the plus side, I bought it for the scanner and the scanner semmed to work really well."
4,Great introduction to journaling,"This is a great guide to journaling for someone who is just starting out, or someone who may have been journaling for a long time but would like to add dimension to their journals. It gives lots of tips and techniques that help to add depth and variety to journals. It even includes a section on poetry. There are lots of exercises that can be used as idea starters. For an individual who wants to expand their journaling life, or begin to journal, this is a great guide. It could be used in a group setting as a guide as well. It is a book that I will read and re-read, and will use over a long period as a guide."
1,horrible,The plane did go together well at all. The wings would not in place. Unable to fly the plane. It went in the trash only minutes after receiving it.
4,"Novelization of ""God Trek""","The even numbered Star Trek movies seem to get the better storylines. V is no exception.Bringing in their novel expert on mind control and obsession, Paramount has issued a novelization that is more understandable then the movie was.If you were confused by the movie, try reading this."
4,Memorable,I had to read this book for a high school English class six years ago. I have been looking for it ever since. Unforgettable.
2,twice the salt,"twice (at least) the salt of season kipper snacks, those with or without salt. not nearly as good.and slightly less kippers per can.disappointing taste."
5,A Good View of British Royalty,"The Queen and Di is a good source of information about British Royalty--their day to day lives, their likes and dislikes. I appreciate that the focus is not entirely on the late and former Princess of Wales, but includes historical backgound as well as facts concerning more recent events in the lives of the royal family."
3,Great Toner. But this seller doesn't pay attention to your order.,"This toner is very refreshing and doesn't dry out my skin considering the one's I received were for dry skin. I ordered the toner for normal skin. However,the fact that this toner doesn't have alcohol in it can be a plus if you use alot of potentially drying products on your face or wash your face alot. It also regulates your ph balance after doing microderm abrasion treatments. It was a pleasant suprise even though the seller sent me the wrong toner. I'm happy and pleasantly suprised with the product. Not very happy with the fact the seller sent me the wrong toner."
1,Can we fix it? No we cant!!!,"some may wonder why someone would ever make a game about such a lame show.....well im here to tell you that its drugs,heavy heavy drugs.......things you can do with bob disk:cup coasterand thats about it,a waist of a good disc that could have been used to make:parappa 2,sillent hill 2,final fantasy 10,or metal gear solid 2"
5,Works great,This works great I had lost my PSP charger this was the perfect fix plus it will fit some of my other electronics.
1,Don't buy,This thing came broken and the company that sold it would not help me. They wanted me to return it and reorder it. I think they should have stepped up a little more.
1,psp 3 in 1 charger,PSP 3-In-1 Chargerthis item realy sucks because i bought this at kmart and the first one worked for a day then went out so i brought back the other one the second one the prong thing was broke then the same thing happened again i highly recomend you find a better product that isnt defective as this one is
4,"A Pretty good book,it won't win a Pulitzer, but well worth it","A Pretty good book, it won't win a Pulitzer ( well maybe it will) but it was good, I enjoyed it.I have been to Panama.. but could not remember a lot of that, I have been to the Miraflores locks and in the city and on the American Base, but that was years and years ago.But, I lived in Belize for two years .. about a year in Belize city and Belmopan.. driving my bicycle over the swing bridge and Haulover Creek. I also lived in Belmopan for about a year, so I got a kick out of all that as well.Anyway, I did enjoy it.I always laugh when I read a good book.. you spend months maybe years writing it and for $20 I get it.. so thanks for all that effort."
2,This is the first HP product I dislike .,"I have had many HP products last forever with no problems. This 7140XI looks like it will perform, but I agree with the other review the product is not ready for prime time. Same complaints as above, HP software is bad, no recent attempts to patch. Scanner gets hung up frequently, Burns through ink. Document feeder has had problems; pulls through multiple pages, they have now resolved with a new doc. feeder. HP customer service has really been so good to me I don't like dissing their product. But, I don't like it, and I am looking for a new all in one. Hope this helps !!"
3,Nice valance,"Color didn't really match the nursery, but decent valances nonetheless. A little pricey for the quality."
2,Didn't look like picture,"I bought these for my daughter's room because I already had 2 valance panels from the same brand and style but needed a couple more. The picture of the valance that I purchased is exactly what I have in style and color, but when I received the product, they were a different style and do not go with what I already have. I was very dissapointed as I really was hoping to have 2 more valance panels to go with what I already had. Shipping though was fast which was really the only positive thing about this purchase, and the valances are in perfect condition...just not what the picture showed."
4,Cute curtains,"Cute curtains. I bought them for a gender-neutral nursery. I love yellow and I love gingham, so thought these would be perfect. They are very cute, but I find the gingham doesn't stand out as much as I might like in yellow. I bet the curtains would look even better with a bolder color."
2,Not even slightly believable,"The characters are all gorgeous or fabulous. In fact, the two 40-year-old plus main women characters are so gorgeous that they have all these men, who are either handsome, rich or famous or all of the above vying for their attention. To strain credibility even more, the main character has a career drop in her lap, and not just any career, but a television career working alongside a (what else?) gorgeous younger studmuffin, who has a thing for her. *Sigh* I'm the same age as these characters are supposed to be and I just wish life could be so easy. Next time, I hope the authers decide to put a tad of reality into their writing. This was just way too over the top."
3,Read The Botox Diaries instead,"This extremely light beach-read type novel was just okay. There's a time and place for fluff reading, even a need for it from time to time. However, a better choice can easily be made. I didn't find any humor in it, or three-dimensional characters. The problems in the ladies' lives are annoying but never so distressing that the reader actually feels for them and their predicaments. The way it all gets nicely wrapped-up in the end was way too pat. And the title? It could have been named ""Grilled Cheese Sandwiches"" and been more relevant."
4,Party Leaders;Sketches,"Written in 1854 and published the next year,this book is fascinating in providing personal sketches of distinguished Americans Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, Andrew Jackson,Henry Clay and John Randolph with many references to other prominent men who were their contemporaries. The author'sanalysis is interesting not only in the spirited description of the individuals profiled but in his comparison of each of them with their political antagonists. The unique perspective he brings a man whose life overlapped some of these figures is worth a read for history or politics buffs. His admiration and defense of some he buttresses with argument. His passion is clear.His oratorical style is typical of the time yet conveys a vivid impression of his subjects, and reminds one of a time before soundbites and simple words geared to a mass audience."
1,Kindle edition - doesn't have the music tracks!?,"I bought the Kindle edition of this book for my ipad, so I would have the backing tracks and book on my ipad for ease of use in the classroom. However, as far as I can see, there are NO music tracks that come with the Kindle version. Yet the whole book is based upon the backing tracks! This kindle edition appears to now be useless and I can't return it."
4,Nice cute little player thats more than just an mp3 player,"Iriver clix is my second Iriver product and it has lived up to my expectations on the performance point. Its the best in the flash mp3 player under 2GB though a bit expensive. The most amazing thing about clix is its output quality. The small little matchbox sized player packs enough looks and power to make anybody have a second look in this flooded mp3 player market. The battery life is good. The few issues I have seen in it, is 1) I cannot delete a folder file from the player itself 2) I cannot rename or move the files/folders which are currently on the player even from a PC, it needs to be recopied from PC. The provided USB cable is iriver proprietary and costs 20$ if you lose one. The volume buttons are + - instead of the regular - +, so bit confusing.Overall, this is a very nice player."
4,"great player, but...","sound is nice; video is nice; software on clix is nice.what sucks is having to use windows media player to move files on and off the player -- its ease of use is nowhere near itunes. i wasted way too much time trying to get everything running smoothly, but it's still difficult compared to ipod-itunes.battery life is much less than advertized.bare bones video conversion software used with the clix sucks, sucks, sucks -- iriver can't even provide a good quality program; you have to use this freeware which gives unacceptable results often."
3,IRiver...What's The Problem?,"I don't know if I just lucked out and got the only bad one in the lot, but this device seems to have nine kinds of problems with .mp3 files that don't end abruptly. If the song fades out, or fades into another song on the same album, the unit either locks up completely, or shuts off to the point where it needs a complete reset. I got tired of being interrupted up to three times during my workouts to reset the device, which can take up to one minute each time. I have already had to delete any Black Eyed Peas file, and incidentally Joan Baez seems to have the same problem. (I don't work out to Joan Baez, by the way.) This unit may accidentally have a 45 lb. plate dropped onto it...three or four times, just like the last mp3 player that failed to satisfy me. A very poor performance by a device which seemed to have great reviews from everyone else. Everything else with the device seems to be fine, the menus are easy to understand, and the transfer of music is adequate."
3,Pretty good,"I got this just because I didn't want to get tied to iTunes. Sound quality is great. Navigation is ok with the click buttons, but it's confusing when listening to a song to queue up a list of other songs. I'm always accidentally cancelling the current song. And podcast support is non-existent. Watching video is possible but to be honest, the screen is just too small to make it practical.Looking back, I'd probably have been better off getting a Nano and just putting up with being forced to use iTunes which at least does what you want."
2,A little big and bulky,"The watch is really pretty I love the color of the band, but it's a little too big and heavy for a ladies watch and I wish the face of the watch should not be so light. It would blend in a little better with the band if it was darker"
1,Confirm you need right or left side quick connect?,Note: This item is indicated to fit 2002 Chevrolet 2500HD (diesel) and it does not fit right side port of Heater Core Line. It might fit left side (furthest) from right fender?I had to purchase Dorman 800409 [...]If you are purchasing this item for port closest to right fender order the Dorman part! It is a exact match to the stock item. And price is cheaper!!
1,mike speaks,"My wife and I have really enjoyed the series. Loves unending legacy was not good. in fact it was a major disappointment. poorly written, gaps in the story line, it seemed thrown together just to get another movie out to the public. My best advise is do not purchase this selection."
1,Movie subject matter,The first four movies went along great with the books.This one is not even on track with the book by the same title. It doesn't go with it at all.I also don't know how they will continue the movie series as this movie had not much at all to do with the book.
3,Well...the first few were good!,"This is a good, wholesome movie. However, ever since Katherine Heigl got too famous to do these movies, the acting crew has continually gone down in talent. I can watch this movie though and not have to worry about the filth of this world infiltrating my home. It is a good movie."
2,"Rented it, Didn't even want to buy it!","I have all the previous DVD's and was horribly disappointed in this one. First they killed off Willie, then they made Belinda the daughter & not the sister. Then the actress they cast to play Marty was terrible, she did not bring that spunk and inner fire to the part the way Katherine Heigel did.Finally, what happen to the virtues Missy had instilled in her? I was quite surprised to see her kiss the sheriff, if you remember in the 2nd one she felt that she should only kiss the man she would marry and not before marriage! I know it's only a kiss, but remember this is not set in the 21st century. The ONLY redeeming quality this has is my favorite DALE MIDKIFF. He is a great actor, when you get pass all the facial nuiances! In short I will not be purchasing this one for my girls."
5,Another great addition to this series of movies!,I think this movie was just as great as all of the movies in this set. Good clean family friendly movies. Along the lines of Little House on The Prairie. I wish more movies were like this. I would recommend this movie as well as the others in this series. I own them all and my whole family counts them in their favorites!
5,Great!,"This product is excellent and really clears up my babies bum very quickly when he has a rash. It also prevents rash when we use it regularly. I am going to try the blue one next since it is talc-free and see if I like it as well as the pink one. They both have zinc oxide in them so both are skin barriers which we need to protect my son's bum from ""poopies"". The pink one goes on very smooth and smells pleasant. It rinses off my hands much easier than barrier diaper ointment however protects his bum just as well. As a pediatric ICU nurse, I wish I had this product to use on my patients in the ICU with diaper rash."
1,total rip-off,Amazon should be ashamed to having this on their website. There is nothing in this so-called article. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING IT.
3,TOO 80's,"I sometimes wonder why someone as underground as DJ would record such a commercial sounding 80's album. It really is irritating, but since I am a huge fan of DJ I can find something good in the music. My biggest complaint is of the over uses of the synth (why?)! This record is not recommended to someone who like punk, like th NYD's or the Ramones. It may be DJ's worst effort, discluding that Buster Pointdexter (...). His voice gets bogged down in some strange voice effects, but there are pieces of brilliance like the titles track. Sometimes I wonder If I'm listening to the soundtrack of a Richard Simmons workout video. That's a little harsh, and I hate to be so critical, but as I said only for the die harders of DJ-like myself."
2,not exactly what I was expecting,"After reading the other reviews in this section, I bought the book. I now suspect that1)the author himself wrote all his reviews or2) his friends wrote all of the reviews.Why else would they talk about how great the author is. Its just a technical book.Anyway, the book is lacking in XP info. Not sure how a book could be published in late 2001 and not have good info on setting up a Windows XP network. Also, not alot of good info on setting up internet sharing in Windows.Not real impressed."
2,Try something else if you have XP,"I was not impressed with the book. I did pick up a few small tips, however, it seemed that the author was a windows ME user and that is what most all of the book was written around. Very very little mention of windows XP. Wish the author and/or publisher had been more upfront and named the book ""A little knowledge of Home Networking for Windows ME""...I would have known a bit more what to expect."
1,Drainage slots are kiss of death,"We have other OXO products and really like them, but slots are just a Bad Idea. Pasta just slides right through."
1,how to make money off parents- by sue m. hannah,"this book makes me sick, by purchasing this book you are paying for the advertising of advertising.the author should be ashamed of herself. most of the book is full of offers for free diaper rash cream, formula or catalogs [FREE CATALOGS!!!! does anyone know of a catalog that you have to pay for]. Some links are dead and most of the information can be obtained anyone who can use a search engine and spell (or use google to spell for you). if you are thinking of buying this book don't."
1,What a waste,Don't try using this book unless you wanted to be hounded with spam email and even calls. I had to even discontinue my email address because the number of spam that was coming through.
2,The heroine is unappealing,"I understand the need for romance writers to make their heroines more appealing to the 21st century reader, but it's a mistake for them to do so. Too many times, romance writers make their heroines promiscuous, and it is just not believeable in an historical time frame. Meg is supposed to have been raised in a strict society home and life, and yet she has had many affairs while still being an unmarried young woman. It turned me off. I enjoy the chase and seduction theme as much as the next person, but I need the plot to remain true to the historical context as much as possible. This just didn't do that. And, to top it off, Bonaparte himself is a character in the novel. Ridiculous. Don't bother with Feather's latest book."
1,the worst jane feather book ever!,"this was the worst jane feather book ever, and i have read most of her books. i've been slightly disappointed here and there but never like this! this book was terrible!. it was boring, it went on for days with nothing happening. by chapter 3 i was thinking ""when is something going to happen?"" by chapter 10 i was thinking ""this is crap! and i want my money back!""save yourself some money. i think i'm so disappointed because i bought and enjoyed ""almost a bride"". it was good! so i was looking forward to this one. what a waste of money!jennifer jones phila, pa"
1,Unbelievable Tripe,"This book to me just seemed to be put together for the money.The ending was so poorly written and so unbelievable that I triedto think of alternate endings.The hero gets killed. Of course, we don't do that in Romance!The hero gets wounded and ends up in Jail. (Done that before)The hero gets an important message from Ana and leaves Meg.Napoleon decides to pursue the war and leaves sooner than planned.Now any of the above would have been so much more believable...but wait...this is NOT reality...this is romance.And, this is the first of Feather's books that I've just hated."
1,Yawn......,"Don't waste your time or money on this one. Nothing to like about either of the main characters. Only finished it because it was like one of those movies you can't believe is so bad, so you keep watching hoping it will get better...well, it didn't get any better!"
1,WARNING,"If this printer is anything like the 1200N, avoid this at all costs. My 1200N is dead after about 1000 pages and almost exactly one month after the warranty expired. HP just laughed at me when I called. Their quality stinks. At least get a long extended warranty....you''ll need it!"
1,So Small you can barely SEE them,When I opened the package I first thought they'd forgot to include the merchandise. This is truly the cheesiest item i've ever purchased through Amazon and will never ever buy this sort of thing sight-unseen again.
1,Smaller than you think!,"I got this for my wife and thought I was getting a good deal, but unfortunately these were so small I was embarrassed giving them to her and was afraid they would slip right out of her little ears."
1,"Description has been updated, but still misleading","When I ordered this product, the description did not contain ""J-K Color"" or the tables describing different sizes and clarity ratings. I was relying on the picture and the regular price of $220, which made $45 seem like a bargain.I returned this product after it arrived. These things are microscopic and extremely cloudy. There is no way you could magnify them to any extent, under any lighting, where they would look like the picture in the description. If you saw these for $220 in a retail store, you would be in Chile."
1,TINY,THE EARINGS ARE NICE WHEN YOU HAVE A MAGNIFING GLASS!!! I LOOKED AT THE PICTURED AND THOUGHT THATA WAS THE REAL SIZE... THEY ARE USEFULL IF YOU WHAT A PIERCING ON YOUR NOSE ...
3,Only if you have several holes,Not worth $40 bucks ...brought earrings for my son for xmas you will be better off buying them for you 6 month old child and older. Will use them for trial and error for my son to see if he will be responsible to get some a little more fancy....Thanks
2,Stud Earrings,They are nice but smaller than what I expected. They could be suitable for a very young girl who is less than 10 years.I am glad that were good for my daughter.Thank you.Saeed
3,Nice but SO SMALL!,"I guess it's my fault for not knowing what exactly this size looks like in real life,but in person, these are soooo small that they actually look like a nose earring or newborn earrings. I would suggest something larger if you want them to actually be seen."
5,A Christmas gift,"My GF has 11 holes in her ears, so I bought x3 sets of these for her at Christmas to cover just over half. She was very happy with them, and I got them on sale for about $35 a pair, so I was ecstatic!!"
2,quick to ship,Picture and product differed in what I expected. I gave them to a friend who had a baby and they were jsut the right size for a 2 month old.
1,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL,"These earrings are NOT WORTH the price. They are so tiny there is no shine or reflection. Smaller than a nose ring. And, the packaging was DISGRACEFUL."
1,Ugh!,"What album have you all been listening to? ""Bad Day"" is a catchy tune, even if the lyrics are a bit banal. But that's the only decent song on the album. The rest of the music is boring, and the lyrics utterly stupid--that is, when they're comprehensible at all. It's not for nothing that no lyrics are included in the CD case.Daniel Powter has one-hit wonder written all over him."
2,It's OK but nothing compared to James Blunt's Back to Bedlam,I purchased this CD because it was recommended when I ordered James Blunt's Back to Bedlam. There's no comparison. It's OK but doesn't move you the way James Blunt can.
2,blah,"Too radio friendly, you might say. The songs are really different from each other though. Only two real good ones: Bad Day and Free Loop, but I just slightly like them. Certainly no need to buy it"
2,one tight cut&the rest was just there,"Bad Day was catchy&it had a attitude that made it a catchy song.vocally Powter sounds like a part of James Blount, part Coldplay,part Maron five, a pinch of Ben Folds&then a few other folks. but Daniel Powter doesn't really have anything else on this Album that touches ""Bad Day"". he might be better suited as a Songwriter for others because going by this album on a whole ain't alot to get excited about."
4,...And I never write reviews for albums!,"Daniel Powter knows how to make songs that just make you feel good. ""Bad Day,"" although perhaps too overplayed, is a great tune. The song in it of itself is very addicting. However, in my opinion, ""Song 6"" is the better song; it has the perfect groove and lyrics. Overall, if you enjoy 'feel good' type music, don't pass this album up."
2,Too much falsetto,"I loved the song ""Bad Day,"" so when the CD was released, I downloaded the whole thing from my music subscription service.I was disappointed. Bad Day is about the only song I anjoyed on the CD. Most of the CD is sung in his falsetto, above his range, and I coudln't understand any of what he was singing. Honestly, I thought he sounded akin to Donald Duck throughout most of it. his lyrics are good, and I give him points for writing his own stuff, but overall I think it's a major disappointment."
3,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...it's a solid effort, but c'mon...how many of these songs will be called ""classic"" in ten years?"
5,Great Family Movie,The whole story of how to make a family survive after your parents are gone to soon is amazingly brought to the screen. It was a very heartfelt drama family movie.
1,ACHIEVE Innovations Corp: awful ...,"..customer service: never received gloves, though ordered in time for Christmas. As they were to be a present, it was embarrassing for me. One email from company stating they were not in stock, though website stated all in stock. My replies returned undeliverable, or ignored.Never trust this company again!"
3,nice enough,"from the excellent Candleland album, the song ""Faith & Healing"" recieves the remix treatment here; and we're treated with 4 different versions that really don't do anything to add to the allure and beauty of the original. but it's a nice song, so it's ok. there's also a remix of one of my favorite tunes from Candleland, the lovely ""Proud To Fall."" here it's given what is called the ""Long Night's Journey Mix"" which may sound all nice and neat, but it's really just an extended drawn out affair that goes on for a long time. but it's kinda cool, i guess. the unreleased tracks on here are good b-sides. the titles are ""Fear Of The Known"", ""Pots Of Gold"", and ""The Dead End."" the packaging of this maxi-single is unique...a cardborad slipcase that fits quite tightly around the slimline jewel case. pretty cool little item for fans of Ian McCulloch."
5,excellent value,I purchased this protractor to measure walls so I could install a picture rail. I am very pleased by the accuracy and quality of the instrument. It was easy to use it. Once I had the angle I just had to set my miter saw up with the same angle. The picture rail looks great.
2,Denali 11 Inch Digital Angle Protractor,This is not a professional protractor. I've had the same experience as many others here who purchased this unit. I sent my first one back because it wasn't even remotely accurate. The second one is accurate to +/- 2 degrees. This is a perfect example of getting what you pay for. It makes the Bosch DWM40L look like a great value even at 3 times the price. I'm giving this product only two stars because they tout about how accurate their product is when it isn't.
5,Lydia Prince,"Great woman of God, I keep this book and refer to it many times. I love books of Christians and their experiences with the Lord. Highly recommend reading this one!"
4,Very Pleased,"We purchased this projector to use in a small, but growing church. The room is fairly bright, but the Epson still does a great job. The audio output is remarkably clear and volume is more than adequate. We are very pleased."
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book! After reading When bad things happen to good people I thought for sure this would be another great read. I was so wrong. I found this book so triteful! I made the mistake of recommending this to my Christian wife (I'm Jewish) and her only comment was ""Atleast his other book was insightful"". After reading the first ten pages my only thought was 'no wonder so many of my people are converting to Christianity!'"
3,3 Way Grounded,"This is not a good representation of John Scofield. I felt the Amazon hype was very misleading on this DVD. I may have actually seen it in the past, but bought it anyway. Uninspired, workaday renditions of familiar, if not favorite tunes."
4,"Read this, then go to Patmos.","This proved to be a very enjoyable book. If you have no interest in things spiritual, then you may not like it, but rest assured that the author does not preach and does not claim that what he found on Patmos is ""the only answer."" I know Greece and am fascinated with Eastern Orthodoxy, but have never been to Patmos. The author's experiences ring true for the nearby Aegean islands that I do know well, and his sensitivity to cultural differences, added to his sense of humor, creates a book worth reading."
3,Spool is great - but cheaper to reload the one you have,"The design of the spool is terrific but it's so easy to refill the spool you're really better off buying some trimmer line in bulk at Home Depot and refilling it yourself.I could see getting a second one to keep a reloaded one handy on standby, but really, it's no trouble to refill the spool yourself and much cheaper than buying replacements. Can't say enough about the product, it's terrific. I love my Ryobi, I have a gas and an electric one (got tired of dragging the cord around but the electric one still works great)."
5,Yoga Strap,"Ordered one color, got another... but it's no big deal. Its a yoga strap. Delivery was prompt without problems."
5,Great for the extremely stiff!,This strap is good for people who are tall or extremely limited in range of motion. Good for steady improvement of flexibility and mobility. Good price too.
5,Good quality. Nice and strong,These straps work great and are very easy to use. Nice and strong with plenty of length for any yoga pose.
2,duane amazon perchase,"no problem getting speed spool bumper , it is not very tough, original lasted 12 years the one i received lasted 2 weed eatting jobs, had to order another one."
5,"Quality Part, Great Price",This was a great shopping experience! The bumper knob part came quickly and was exactly as described. It fit perfectly and was easy to install. Was quickly back in action trimming again for a fraction of the cost of replacing the entire unit. Would highly recommend to anyone who simply needs a bumper knob replacement.
3,"Great Unit , Except...............","I bought this CD, Clock Radio because it had digital tuning and great sound with playing options. It measured up in all of those areas. It also had a bright display for day, and somewhat uniquely, had a dim enough display for night. Some thing that others products in this catagory seem to have a problem with. I unfortunately had to return the unit because I use my radio every night to fall asleep. This unit did not have a timed sleep function which I think was a major oversight in the design that even the cheapest clock radios have. The fact that this clock radio did not have the new ""Daylight Savings Time Hours"" in the program would have been tolerable if the sleep function had been incorporated into the unit's capability. If there is a newer model that has these areas re-addressed, I would buy it."
4,The Revised English Bible,"Building on the New English Bible of 1970, the Revised English Bible represents a new generation of scholarship. The revisers used the Novum Testamentum Graece edited by K. Aland et al.(26th edition,1979) as the major point of reference. The archaic ""Thou"" was abandonded and a more inclusive language used where the text demands. Additional aids for readers have been included. Overall, a very readable text and an excellent translation."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money. The soles have fallen off this shoe. I called Amazon and since it was over the 30days, they don't back them either. Never buying shoes from Amazon again. Or buying these shoes. They looked cute, worked well with my cloths, but cheap quality."
5,Read this for a book report...,"I have to say that this is porobably one of my favorite horror stories to date. My freshman year in highschool (2008-2009) we were given a book report to do. As long as it was appropriate, we could do any book we wanted. So, i asked my friend if I could borrow this one. Little did i know that it would give me nightmares, nor did i know that it would be the book that got me into horror novels.The Manse is an old home whose origional owners gave permission to the town to use as the widely popular haunted house each halloween. However, little do they know that The Manse's bloody history has actually manifested itself into a real-life House of Horrors. There are so many twists to the home's history, and the author leaves you turning the page in anticipation of what horrific scenes lie ahead."
2,wrong size jar,"The chocolate covered raisins seemed fine from the packaging, but when I looked at the container, it was a 48 oz jar instead of a 51 oz jar. I tried to send it back for a refund or get a jar that was the correct size for the money I paid, but there was no return option. It was only a 3 oz difference from the original, but I was still disappointed that I did not receive the item I wanted for the price I paid. Other than that, I am satisfied with my purchase."
5,pokemon,"Great . Arrived before estimated day to arrive. Good choice, very powErs with the product. I bought it cuz I trying to recreate my chhild hood in the 90s so Wen I have kids, they can c wut their dad grew up wit"
4,Guide that reads like a novel,This book is interesting because it gives great marriage advice but reads more like a novel than a guide. It's also great to get a perspective from a different culture. Easy-to-read and theologically-sound. Highly recommend.
4,FOUR STARS DUE TO THE BACK/UNLIT CLOCK TIMER,"Nice looking product. Simple.... although looks more expensive than it is. True stainless steel on the outside and nice design. Don't understand the complain of the person who carelessly broke the carafe. It could happen even in the most expensive glass coffee makers if you are not careful. ""2587""!!! : - O"
4,Fittapaldi - Driver's Profile,This is a good book on Emerson Fittapaldi. This book should be updated to include Emerson's second Indianapolis 500.
3,BEEN THERE DONE THAT.,"The people trapped inside of building having to escape by figuring out puzzles has become overdone. Frankly I am a bit burned out by it all, I stopped watching Saw movies at IV because it got so bad and so far from the original, although not as bad as Halloween 3, which had nothing to do with the first two movies other than the fact it was Halloween.What is different about this movie which made it tolerable to watch was that it concentrated on the technicians who were operating the cube rather than the blood and guts aspect of people getting killed in imaginative fashion, although it does have some of that.The bad guy with the fake eye was almost cartoonish. If you sat through the other two movies and liked them, you know you are going to watch this one anyway, so why are you reading the reviews?No sex or nudity."
1,A Big WTF!,"I don't even know where to begin.The film's concept was well-conceived but poorly executed. The acting was beyond horrible, sometimes even unbearable. When the talent faltered in the original Cube, the simplicity and dimension of the film made up for it. That's not the case with this one. Cube 2 was no monumental classic either, however, it was at least mildly entertaining and pleasant to look at even if it does hold so little weight it's not worth remembering.If you like typical Sci-Fi Channel (or SyFy as it now calls itself) fare, complete with cheesiness, overdone special effects, predictibility, actors practically being fed their lines, and an overall feeling that you've just been robbed when you're done watching the film, you will LOVE Cube Zero."
3,If you like Genesis...,"i can't believe I found this cd. I stumbled upon it by accident, and it brought the memories of the early 80s flooding back!If you like Genesis, you'll have a taste for the Sherbs! They open with a great 3 punch-I Have the Skill,Back to Zero & Cindy is Waiting! But don't miss the rest, including the incredible No Turning Back, the Phil Collins-like Juliet & Me and Parralel Bars! Now with bonus tracks! Cool! Be sure to look up their 2nd (and last?) release Defying Gravity, if for nothing else, the gem called We Ride Tonight!"
4,A Great Book,"I read this book over a long weekend. I didn't want anyone to talk to me because I couldn't put it down. I did not realize until a few chapters into it that there were two parallel story lines, both so interesting that I wanted to finish each chapter as soon as possible. Everyone will love this book.Sometimes I had to reread lines when she uses a few cutesy terms but that is my only criticism."
4,satisfying junkfood,"funny how one reviewer was offended by depiction of ""emasculated"" gay black man: I thought his character was too perfect. He's like the noble black man with no faults. Being gay only makes him more wonderful. ps i know a man like him: black,gay republican, smart and sweet."
3,In Hindsight......,"This album will probably forever be known as the one that killed Twisted Sister's career. Looking back, it's not hard to see why fans furiously rejected it. Before this album, Dee and the band seemed rather adept at mixing menace with just enough campiness to make things fun. On this particular album, however, they went over the top and (especially on the ill-advised cover of ""Leader Of The Pack"") overdosed on goofy humor. A shame, because they got their best and toughest production job yet from Dieter Dierks, who's armor-plated work with The Scorpions and Accept won him much acclain. Listening to this CD again after so many years, tunes like ""Come Out And Play,"" ""You Want What We Got"" and ""Kill Or Be Killed"" stand up as fun anthems and some of the group's best. ..., even ""Be Cruel To Your Skewl"" elicits some memorable chuckles.One of those CDs that didn't seem like much at the time, but kinda grows on you years later."
3,Worth buying just because Alice Cooper is on it,"Come out and Play was the follow up to Twisted Sister's biggest selling album Stay Hungry. There aren't as many good songs on it, but there are some, the best being, ""Be Chrool To Your Scuel"". There's also a cover of ""Leader of The Pack"" that has a great guitar sound on it. ""I Believe In You"" is the only power-ballad or slow song I've heard from TS. Overall, it's a good album."
5,"my random, scattered notes","Street SpiritGorgeous harmony and haunting moods. Voice work is exceptional.Nice DreamAn opium-like shot to the neurons that instantly toys with the neurotransmitters in a beautiful way.My Iron LungReminds me of a cross between Nirvana and ""All I Need is the Air that I Breathe and to Love You.""JustNice upbeat gyrating guitars and thunderous drums - best guitar work on album.High and DrySoaring anthem rock that brings in a nice little acoustic touch. Very moody.Fake Plastic TreesHypnotic, lovely melody that brings solace and tears of joy. So addictive. My favorite song on the album.BonesScreeching, wailing ecstasy. Very cathartic.Black StarDreamy spacey, rockin' ear candy.Planet TelexLike Iggy Pop singing U2's Lemon while on Junk.The BendsA Dylanesque rocker that harks back to New York in the seventies. Reveals many influences."
4,Get Bent,"I confess...I got into Radiohead late, circa ""OK Computer,"" but became an instant fan. ""OK"" and ""Bends"" are their strongest albums, in my estimation, and ""Bends"" finds the boys doing what they do best...blending the distinctive, melodic Brit Pop sound with nasty, highly-produced guitar rock. This album boasts beautiful songs like ""Bulletproof"" and ""Fake Plastic Trees"" as well as songs ""My Iron Lung"" and ""Bones"" that will get you speeding tickets. Don't be bullied by musical elitists into thinking that you have to like ""Amenisiac"" and ""Kid A"" if you want to count. It's true that Radiohead's strength lies in their willingness to shun the mainstream and break new musical ground, but you'll find them doing that on ""The Bends""...and you'll have an CD that will stay in your rotation a lot longer."
4,The begining of brillance.,A very solid band begins down a path of brilliance with the song. Who knew how far they would go.
4,Mainstream classic rock album,"Well, maybe it's not the ""unbornchikkenvoices"" sound of Radiohead' latest album, ""OK Computer"", but this is a great album too. I bought this album because of ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"", but after few listenings I started to like ""High And Dry"", ""My Iron Lung"", ""Black Star"" and ""Sulk"" as well. My favourite track on the album is ""(Nice Dream)"" because its mellodic mood and brilliant lyrics. ""They loved me like I was a brother, protect me, listen to me"" is exactly what I feel and aclaims to get, like Thom Yorke."
3,Not as Good,"I'm sorry but this is not a 5-star album. OK Computer is a fantastic and lyrically and instrumentally stimulating CD. The Bends is good, but not great. Let's be honest, they did not come into their own until OK Computer and Kid A. The album is good, but the instrumentals are weak compared to a lot of other CDs."
3,Some CLASSIC Radiohead Here - But Mostly Below Their Best,"Radiohead, as a group, based on their accomplishments up to this point, are one of the best groups now or ever. ""The Bends"" is not Radiohead's worst album, in my opinion, but it comes close. There are a couple songs that are essential - among their best work - but this album is mostly subpar for Radiohead. ""Just"" and ""Nice Dream"" are both classic songs that belong on any ""Best of..."" album that you could compilate, but other than that, the songs on ""The Bends"" are not as good as most Radiohead songs, and certainly fall short of Radiohead's following album, their best, in the form of ""OK Computer""."
5,must have,"pretty much one of the best albums of all time. If OK Computer is Sgt. Pepper, then this is Revolver. It's dark and moody, but still has songs that can stand on their own. If you don't like this album, I don't want to be your friend. too bad."
5,This is an incredible album,"""The Bends"" is an amazing album musically. Lyrically it is disappointing as the lyrics don't make an ounce of sense. Why can't lyricists go listen to Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon""? That is a CD with brilliant, meaningful lyrics and outstanding music. Musically, this is at least as good as that album. Lyrically, it leaves much to be desired. But anyway, songs are for listening, anyway, not reading, and lyrics can be forgiven if the music is good enough. One guy (just below this review) said ""the lyrics will make you think and you won't probably understand them because they are too deep in meaning and we dare not reach such intellectuality""...They make you think alright...but lyrics that are indecipherably deep are pointless as no one will ever find the meaning..."
5,Get this AND Ok Computer,"This is smack dab in the middle between the straightforward bombast of Pablo Honey(pretty much Creep) and the Waaaaaaaaaayy out there(pulling it off perfectly) experimentalism of Ok Computer. I can honestly admit that 10 of the twelve songs are amazing, and the other 2 are great(a lesser band would kill for one of those two as a single). This album is both creepy AND takes you flying high with emotion you didn't think you had. It's a CD for all your moods and then some. Just buy it unless you want Ok Computer first...THEN buy this."
4,power of radiohead,"so let's see...you record this small little record named 'Pablo Honey' and one song off of it connects with the disgrunted, disillusioned and otherwise pathetic (but quite numerous) American lads. You become famous but are starting to wear thin because you could be filling the 'One Hit Wonder' cliche. What do you do? you make a record which destroys every preconception that everyone else had of you. Hell, there's even a song on the album which mocks 'Creep' (do you know which one?) No other album I can think of gives you the sonic attack that Radiohead does with their three guitar lineup. Yet for all the harshness in here, the simple songs stand out the most... I never liked 'Creep' or 'My Iron Lung' anyhow."
5,Just Beautiful!,"I know it's a shame that I just bought this album almost a decade after it came out, but fortunately I did buy it. I can't really say that I am a true Radiohead fan since I don't have all their albums and am fairly ignorant when it comes to their songs, but The Bends is truly a beautiful piece of work. I rarely listen to CDs from beginning to end, but this one is a rare exception. I can actually listen to the whole CD and not be bored with certain songs.The album is filled with absolutely fantastic music and very profound messages.I must say that I am having a difficult time believing that many people state that O.K. computer is better than The Bends. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe O.K. computer is better, but it will require me to listen to that album for long periods of time before it can, in my humble opinion, equal the beauty and complexity of The Bends."
5,Radiohead's best,"Now, I don't own this album, but I've heard most of the songs on it. So, I'll do a track by track review on the songs I've heard.High and Dry:10/10 nice little pop songFake Plastic Trees:10/10 i remember vividly seeing this video on much music and thinking ""What the f*** was that s***!?"" I thought it was so odd, that I'd never get into Radiohead, but after a few more listens, I was hooked.Bones:10/10 Underrated, a good rocker with odd lyricsJust:10/10 One of my personal favorites, the video is great and so is the songmy Iron Lung:10/10 my favorite, very memorable riff at the begining.Street Spirit(Fade Out):10/10 very gloomy and beutiful song with a great riff and great lyrics.So, there you have it, all the songs I've heard from ""The Bends"". I'd buy it, but its, like, $30 dollars at ""Play""(My local record store). So Ill just look for a cheaper copy, till then, Ill keep enjoying the tracks I have from ""The Bends"""
5,It's the best thing that you've ever had,"This was the first Radiohead classic, the first one to really wow everyone and establish Radiohead as a great band. Simply put Radiohead have produced some of the best music in their three classics thus far (Bends, OK Computer, Kid A) and a lot of that is on this record. Great songs like Just, My Iron Lung, Fake Plastic Trees, Planet Telex, Street Spirit, High and Dry (basically the whole CD) are masterpieces. This one is more song oriented than OKC and Kid A yet it portrays 'classic' Radiohead throughout and will not disapoint anyone that owns it."
1,Where do I begin,"Ok so ""Creep"" stands out to me cause I grew up with that song pounded into me on the radio and MTV, so I figured hey let's see what the hype is all about. I just don't get it,this sounds like pre emo garbage,Tom's(spelled wrong on purpose)voice is whinny and annoying wtf is the big deal about slow crybaby music with random noises and slow beats with no melody. I tried I really tried so hard to like this,and gave it many rotations both sober and high,but at the end of the day it's just boring music to me."
1,unlistenable,"I found this album to be a huge disappointment. By far the most boring, mind numbing album i've heard in a very long time. Absolutely awful."
3,"Solid, Not a Masterpiece","Radiohead`s sophomore album is an upgrade of their promising but uneven debut ""Pablo Honey"". A strong and compelling rock record, ""The Bends"" is a bit above most of the uninteresting britpop bands that dominated the charts during the mid-nineties. Radiohead deliver some appealing and well-crafted indie rock moments here, more guitar-oriented than their latest releases (that incorporate electronic influences). Although a good album, ""The Bends"" is not quite a classic, since it has more filler than it should and is lacking in diverity (a couple of songs are too similar). Still, it offers many memorable moments like the mellow ""High and Dry"", the moody ""Nice Dream"", the ethereal ""Fake Plastic Trees"" and especially the haunting ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"", one of the band`s best songs. Despite being too overrated, this Radioheah effort is an enticing listen that presents a few gems worth discovering.Recommended."
1,"Let your imagination soar, just don't expect this glider to.","Bought a couple of these for the kids to play with for christmas day, I remember as a kid playing with gliders and they can be a lot of fun.These are not those gliders however. You throw it very hard, it gets a lot of lift, goes straight up, then straight back down. If you throw it soft enough to not go up, it will only go about 10 feet before hitting the ground.It seems to be pretty durable, (as far as foam gliders go) though we've only played with it on grass. the stickers don't stick to good, though I've never seen many stickers that will stick to styrofoam.I would not recommend getting this as a glider, though it looks like a convincing model airplane, and younger children would still have fun with it, or ours did."
2,sound quality is bad,"The sound quality is not the best,have to have it turned all most all of the way up and it sounds garbled."
3,Silence,"The album is divergent and is the second album put out by Staple. Staple is a Heavy Metal Christian band.The song ""Sound of Silence"" is pretty cool. It is a loud song that contains a lot of bass and electric guitar. The lyrics are not Christian but are still consistent with other songs. What draws me to listen to the group is the way they play. I love their head - banging music and the fact that they are Christian. The songs that they sing are not exactly Christian lyrics, but the lyrics still praise God.To compare their album to another singer I would have to pick Sides of the North. They both play the same type of music, but Staple is harder and full of more head-banging moments than Sides of the North. Both of them use non Christian lyrics and great alternative music to show their love for God."
1,NOT for 155r,this is listed for the 155r ryobi cordless but it is not. I ordered this and found out it is not the right one. Even the back of the box does not list the model 155. Why does Amason still say it will fit?????
5,All The Way Banged Out,"CJ Mac is tired of cameo appearances. If you heard his first album, you would question his ability to carry his own album. But it seems that after his first attempt he went straight back to the drawing board and reinvented himself. He shone on tracks with Ant Banks, W.C., and other rappers. So when it was time to let his ""Platinum Game"" glisten, he was definately ready. Regardless of what you thought about his first album, if you crave banged out west coast rap, you will love this album. Check out ""Hate"", ""King of L.A"", ""Ends"", and ""Cha - Cha"". This CD is a classic."
4,One of the better Haujobb albums,"While I originally didn't like or understand their move to electronica, this album caught on pretty quick and stuck with me for a long time. This is really one of their better albums (#2 in my head), and is a must-have for anybody interested in Haujobb.These songs are subliminal and stick with you for a while. You realize at some point that they're just great songs. They're a little soft, and I miss the Industrial side of Haujobb, but this is definitely one of my most cherished records. Just as good if not better than Homes and Gardens."
5,Perfect size,"I've had these little cuties for awhile now and still love them. I originally bought them to make mini loaves of bread for Christmas gifts but the rest of the year I use them more for mini meat loaves. Doesn't take as long to bake either because they are so small.Here, I'll share the recipe:1&1/2 lb. Ground meat- (1)egg- (1) cup seasoned bread crumbs- (1) 8 oz. Can tomato sauce- (1) tsp garlic powder- (1) tsp onion powder. * Mix all together in a large bowl. Spray pan with cooking spray. Fill each loaf, then with a spoon smooth the top and make a small indention in the top of each loaf to hold the topping. Topping-mix 2 tbsp brown sugar and 1/4 cup ketchup. Then spread over each loaf. Bake 350 for 30 minutes. NOTE: if using a ground meat with more fat, they will shrink a little.ENJOY!"
5,police field operations,book was needed to move up in career. was shipped promptly and in excellent condition. I have always had excellent results whn ordering any book from Amazon.
3,This book is acceptable.,"Police Field Ops is like going back to the police academy. The book slowly walks you through every single situation you could encounter. Since such a wide topic is covered, specifics (as in the academy) cannot be covered. Adams, the author, is apparently familiar with California Penal Code and occasionally discusses it, but not enough to alienate readers from other jurisdictions. If you're reading the book for general knowledge then it will fulfill your needs."
3,quality is not better,"The earrings are petite and well made; pretty if you don't look too closely. The diamonds don't look like the illustration, but cloudy. I expected them to be small and certainly not perfect - however, I am disappointed that the quality is not better."
2,small with defect,The earings were well crafted but one diamond had a defect so I returned the set. They were also much smaller than I expected (a good size for baby jewelry).
5,excellent cd!,"Good,and groovy soul tune's of the '70's every song is a hit ,this would be a good cd at your next party or just to listen too!"
4,Pretty good,Pretty good for around the house light to medium duty stuff.Hanging pictures etc...Li-Ion battery is a plus.
4,Small Package Surprize,"I have used cordless drills for years. I had planned to buy a much more expensive model. I wanted the lithium battery because I was tired of replacement batteries not being cost effective. I figured I would try this for small jobs because it would be easier on my old wrist. I was surprised at the torque. I haven't had it long enough to see how it handles wear and tear. It is easy to hold, fits in my nail bag with a short bit. The drill bits made it where I didn't miss my cordless drill as much. I would not recommend this for repetitive commercial work but perfect for the homeowner and light construction."
4,It's SOOOOOO cute!,"It's so cute! It's like a little baby power drill, all tucked away in its little black nylon sleeper.But it works. And darn well for what it is.Single-torque, so no speed control, but it put together my new filing cabinet in minutes. Seriously. And to think for months I was using my Leatherman.I was SOOOOOOO stupid.But I'm all better now."
4,Rather extreme sadism but well-plotted and written.,"Andersson admittedly purges himself of his ideas on sadism (rather like Anne Rice did in her ""Beauty"" series, though in a much more extreme fashion) and includes witchcraft, snuff videos, Goddess-worship, malignant life after death and a VERY protective Italian Mamma. Not for the weak of stomach, though the Grand Inquisitor would doubtless enjoy it!"
3,only half the story,"this book is best for people grading by hand, as it gives step by step instructions on how to move the pattern to grade up/down.it does NOT give standard grading charts of standard sizes. it gives only the BASIC BASIC grades between them, such as 2"" for the waist.I was expecting something a lot more thorough and updated than this, especially since the apparel industry has changed so much. I wanted standard specs with grading, not common-sense instructions on shifting a pattern up and out, etc."
3,FourPlay,"It is like a Woody Allen wannabe movie, but enjoyable. Loved the London settings, found some of the scenes with a counselor very amusing. Firth is as enjoyable as ever, even with a weak script to work with."
2,Very basic,I would not recommend this book. It's old and dated. Kids these days have a much broader vocabulary than this book recognizes. This is a very limited resource.
2,rusty cutters :(,"i was so happy to finally try out some new cookie cutter shapes, and for a set of Wiltons purchased from the local bed, bath and beyond, i couldnt resist. they worked well the first time i used them, but unfortunately, they rusted from after i washed them. from this experience, i know from now on to purchase stainless steel ones instead of whatever these are made from."
2,jon secada clearly missed the target on this second album,I remember being so excited to buy and hear this album. Although after hearing this album I was sorely disappointed. This album was too fake and chorusy lacking the richness of true soul. It took me all my power not to take it back to the store. Unfortunately for me I couldn't find the reciept.
4,This stepping stone book is good,The Minstrel in the Tower is a story in the setting of the Middle Ages. It contains a young boy named Rogers and an excellent tree climber named Alice. These two children are on a quest to give the lute to their father. I think anyone would like this book.
3,What you see is NOT what you get!,"The photo of the blade is the true product. Thick with plenty of wear time. What I received was not the published photo but an inferior ""MTD"" replacement blade. Much thinner meaning it wears out way faster than the originals. When I complained to the seller they said that MTD now owns Ryobi and that is ""the"" blade. As I told them, I was quite dissappointed that the quality of their product has deteriorated so much. You should realize that you will NOT get what you ordered if you buy from this company."
5,As Good as New Again,Had my original blade for about 7 years. Replaced it this year with this one. My edger is truly like new again. No more backing up to re-edge the same area two or sometime three times if I waited too long between edges. I used this new blade on the first edging of the season. Works like a champ!!!
4,Need to stretch,I have broken a rib on three occasions. When I'm forced to sit for long periods of time on the job my back will knot up severely. I'll take a break and secure the strap at one end to a beam then I will perform several arm stretches that relieve my back and shoulder tension. The product is handy with all the different grab loop locations.
5,Rev 1,"Great album. If u enjoy this, i recommend getting Revolutionary Vol. 2.also get The Middle Passage which will come out soon...Lyrics: 10/10Production: 8.5/10"
1,spend your money on something that will last,The bag on this thing broke after 3 months of use. The only place online that I can find that sells a replacement bag is in the UK...and the bag runs about $48 US dollars - half the cost of the machine in the first place.Ya....this machine sucks and blows. Literally. Don't waste your money on this product. It will suck your pocket book dry.
2,Bag Replacement,I found an online site to get bags at outdoordistributors.com. Better to call 1-877-70Parts and order to make sure you get the right connection shape. One bag costs $24.01. We have had 2 bags break in the past 4 years. Very poorly constructed. Both the zipper and the actual bag material have broken.
3,Poor Quality Zipper on Bag,"The machine works, but the Plastic Zipper easily broke and a replacement bag is hard to find."
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"Given the reviews, I was surprised by how little I liked this book. I liked the idea of it, but it was so deadly boring, I stopped reading about a third of the way through. I'm always on the lookout for mysteries with ""literary"" quality writing, but this one didn't work for me."
4,"Taut, gripping, and you root for the anti-hero","Where has this book been for the last 45 years? Amazingly, Patricia Highsmith weaves a story that is just as fresh and believable today as when she published it in 1955. The characters are compelling, intriguing, and as a reader you find yourself snared in the ever deepening complexities that Mr. Ripley faces. Also, I found myself facinated by and amazingly sympathetic to Tom Ripley, at times even rooting for him against the established, moneyed, empty cultured lifestyle he both despises and longs for.In addition, the ending is a bit unexpected, but one I had secretly hoped for...it will be hard for the movie to top this piece of fiction. Enjoy!"
3,Disappointed,"I found the story to contain a very interesting premise, but it was not well executed. I found myself not caring much about Ripley as a character because his motivations were not well descibed, and many chances were missed to show us the subtleties and little peculiarities of character that woud have brought Ripley to life and etched him into our memories.Perhaps the author intended to show the very superficial reasons for many of the actions taken by the psychopathic personality, but the style of writing itself was as bland and as superficial as the character.I would prefer to read a story about an ordinary character that is superbly told rather than a story about a potentially intriguing character that is poorly told."
2,I hope the movie was better.......,"I haven't seen the movie yet, but I honestly hope that it was better than this book. It dragged tremendously, and for $13 dollars the book was too short. I lost interest numerous times, but I was determined to finish it. This is definitely not one of those books that you would like to read a second time."
1,Strongly disappointing! Totally unacceptable!,"Aside from asenseless plot of touring the reader from one Italian city to theother, Tom's characterization is nowhere near what I expected (based on what I have read from other viewers/readers). He is nothing more than a scheming, envious, social climber, loser --- rather than a hero as others claim him to be. Most importantly, I find it despicable for the author to come up with an ending such as the one in the book. Where has her moral & social responsibilities gone? I am not a fundamentalist nor a right-wing individiual, but by creating the ending, the author condones evil in the society instead of bringing up justice."
3,Mysteriously attractive humor,"Yeah, I know that the critics hated it, and I can sometimes find reasons to agree with their assesments. But, I am mysteriously drawn to this farce. The notion of mixing Renoir, New York City ""artworld"" sophistication, the ""new"" South and the old, spiced with as many stereotypical characters as possible takes theatre of absurdity into an uncharted territory. I love how over the top are the characters; how the plot while seemingly a series of unconnected events manages to collect itself, and how the resolution is somewhat surprising.No S&B; is not a great film, maybe not even a good one, but it has the appeal of a cult film that make me want to watch it again to try and figure out what the film maker is trying to tell me. On the way I discover another joke that I have missed, or I laugh again at the familiar ones. I have recommended this film to many, some of which laugh with me, and others who shake their heads and walk away. Enjoy it if you are able."
3,Anime or live action?,"This popular series made its initial success as a manga, and later this - an anime of an unconventional teacher whose methods are often quite winning. I had to admit, I prefer the live action series thanks to its razor-sharp humor, but the popularity of this franchise still exerts an effect on an audience. Was eventually made into a movie by Miike Takashi."
5,Excellent!,"I'm 12 and I've grew up around these songs, my dad always playing them on the radio. I first realized how totally awesome the Beach Boys were when I was about 6. Since then, I've become obsessed! I love all the songs on this CD, all of them are awesome, written great. Nice, upbeat songs. Personally, my absolute favorites are Wouldn't it be Nice and Kokomo, even though all of them rock! For those of you who love these rock and roll oldies, this CD is the one for you!"
2,Like Putting Filet Mignon In A Meat Grinder,"This is a record company which does not have a clue about this group. Granted the music is remastered but this collection does not make sense. It is not organized either topically or chronologically. The cover artwork remains horrible. Real Beach Boys fans already have most, if not all of these songs already. For some of these surfing and car songs, this is the ninth go-round on a CD collection. Capitol needs to rerelease the two-fer collections pressed in the early 90s, restore the Warner Brothers material, not put together another hits anthology. The Beach Boys were one of the greatest groups of the 60s and a groundbreaking vocal group. This release does not do their career the proper respect it deserves. Come on, Capitol, let's get your act together!"
4,GOOD...,THEY DID A GREAT JOB SELECTIN' THE SONGS THAT ARE PART OF THIS ALBUM-- BUT THE SOUND Is JUST TERRIBLE!oO MAYBE THAT'S HOW THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO SOUND-BUT I COULDN'T KNOWN THAT-I'M JUST 16yos.
