1,Please do not read this book.,"Ravi Zacharias writes with a mission, namely to discount the similarities and possibile interconnectedness of Christianity and Buddhism. If you wish to determine the relationship between these two major religions for yourself, please read something else more historical or factual. His arguments are specious as he has an incomplete understanding of Buddhism, and seemingly even his own Christian religion. This book is propaganda, not research or fact. There are many inaccuracies and things overlooked."
1,shallow,"The Lotus and the Cross: Jesus Talks with Buddhapretty shallow grasp of some buddhist concepts and lack of basic understanding of some doctrinal eastern philosophy, full of presuppositions slanting towards christianity without critical analysis of same. I thought It would be an unbiased assessment of both creeds but sadly not so , just propaganda trying to dress up as something else"
2,"Another Crap Now Album, big shock","Its funny how these thing sell like gangbusters, and always reach thet top of the billboard charts, because most of the music on their album is crap mainstream music that the public will buy no matter how bad the music is.The only worthwhile songs are the last 5 song on the list.16. Let Me Go - 3 Doors Down17. Be My Escape - Relient K18. Mr. Brightside - The Killers19. Speed Of Sound - Coldplay20. Feel Good Inc. - GorillazWhoever is in charge of putting together these albums needs to be fired."

3,Pretty Good...........for my taste,"I think this Cd was good because I really like Gwen Stefani, Reliant K and Backstreet Boys Incomplete. If I made the Cd though,It would have more Reliant K, Kelly Clarkson, Gwen Stefani, Jojo, lindsey Lohan and Jessie McCartney and Green Day and Good Charlotte and Bowling for Soup. Also INCOMPLETE and a little Carrie Underwood. But less like...........rap songs I HATE RAP (unlike my cousin). Also some dancing songs because I am a dancer. Maybe you could have I kids one.........BUT NO KIDS SINGING!!!!!!!!"
1,^$%$%^$%$ Now thats what i call Music,"Just what we need, More lame pop/rap songs for mtv teenie boppersBands they should playSpazzSlayerCibo MattoSystem of A DownWeezerSonic youthNapalm Death"
3,Half and Half for Me!,"I talk about 1/2 of the songs on it, and the other 1/2 are not for me. I like Anna Nalicks. I actually like the backstreet boys Incomplete. I don't really like their songs but this one is much better then they've EVER done.(Can I get another amen.-AMEN!-) I agree that it is mostly a pop CD so if you aren't into the pop scene, this CD probably isn't for you (unless you want to waste your money on a disc you won't listen to or that will cause your head to ache.)Opps...I'm tring to get you interested!Acutally, I'm 1/2 and 1/2 on this CD so it doesn't matter.If you are like me, and like a little bit of everything you will most likely enjoy it."
4,Wonderful Music,"I am so into my garden this summer. I searched out garden under music just to see what kind of music came up. The English Garden popped up and after listening to the selections I decided to get it. I also have Piano Birds by Dan Gibson that I find very relaxing. These two albums are very similar. In Piano Birds it is just that...lovely soft simple, slow piano melodes with bird songs sprinkled into the mix. I would say that this album is more of the same, except there are many more different layers of different instruments. Sometimes I feel like I am waking up in a a Harry Potter movie..it is enchanting. Try it out...the download price is right. I would highly recommend it. I don't like all of Dan Gibson's music, but this one is a winner to me."
2,"Good features, poor quality.","The features of this phone are perfect, and worked very well for a few months. However, at this point the batteries in the handsets we have (2 of them) don't last more than a few hours on standby, and we cannot use either handset to dial a number because the digit buttons rarely work. This is typical of my experiences with Vtech products - I am done with this brand!"
1,Worst phone ever,"Hard to dial.Confusing keypad.And to top if off, likes to hang up on people while it ""searches for base"".One of the worst things I have ever bought."
5,Great book from Sybex,"I highly reccomend this book to anyone who wishes to undertake the 70-210 exam. I used this book along with trancenders q's and I passed the test. The book was very clear and I had no problems understanding it. It wasnt boring, like some certification books are. If a certification book is dull and boring you will have no motivation to read it - this book is the opposite, its an easy read. I reccomend also they you do a fair ammount of practice q's as well, then you will understand what the q's are asking you, and what your expected to know. You may know the answer to the question, but the way the question is worded you think you have no idea.All in all a good book"
1,Not Without My Daughter #2,"It seems like anything that could possibly go wrong for this woman did go wrong. In the few months that this chracter lived in Iran she confronted all those things that people always hear about happening to someone else somewhere in Iran, but never actually witness. I lived in Iran for four years during the most ""terrible times."" I did not see any woman's hair being cut in public, nor was I hit by a stray Iraqi missile. Further, for whatever personal reasons, it seems like the author has an extreme dislike for Iranian men. In short, I would not recommend this book for the simple reason that it does not reflect"
2,Disappointing,Was very disappointed to see a Persian writer write such things... Americans already have a bad view of us and Iran.. Why make it worse?
3,Scenic,I just finished this book in 2 sittings. I guess at this point in time we all have mixed opinions of how we feel about the middle east and the peoples that live there. However I found this book giving me a some what inside view of day to day life in Iran. This book was written before the US's troubles with Iran so I know things have changed. But after reading this book I thought what it would be like to visit there. We don't see the day to day culture much on TV just the stereotypical images we've all gotten to know so well lately. To me was a nice slice of life novel and would recommend it.
3,"Works well in the movie, but doesn't hold up when listened to alone","Some soundtracks hold their own weight both in a movie as well as when listened to by themselves. Unfortunately, ""Aeon Flux"" isn't one of them. I've enjoyed the music of Graeme Revell in other soundtracks, but this one was a chore to get through, even if it was perfect for the movie.You have to be a VERY big fan of this genre of music to sit through the entire album, and even then I can't see too many people giving it multiple listens. It's not bad music; don't misunderstand me. It's just, well, rather bizarre. Again, it worked fine in the movie with all the visuals. But alone, it loses a lot of its momentum and comes across as flat.But on the plus side, the inside booklet has some very sexy photos of Charlize Theron. I'm tempted to say that this is worth the price of admission."
4,nice CD,"First of all, to the previous reviewer: I never heard an Evanescence song on the previews, but they did put Headstrong by Trapt on the DVD commercials. Second, I really did like this CD. Graeme Revell did a superb job on the instrumental songs, just like he did on the Daredevil soundtrack. My fav track is the last one, Aeon Flux. Loved the movie, loved the soundtrack.Now, just for your pure pleasure, click the ""yes"" button to the proceeding question."
4,Yaz Card Set,"This is a nice set of 20 different cards from the end of Carl Yastrzemski's career, with many of them from after his induction into the Hall of Fame. No particularly valuable cards, but a nice set for anyone who really respects Yaz and his career with the Red Sox."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"WATCH OUT...NONE of the following songs are on this CD:1) New York (Ya Out There) - Rakim (18th Letter/Book Of Life)2) Things Done Changed - Notorious B.I.G. (Ready to Die)3) Area - De La Soul (Buhloone Mind State)4) Get On This - Ugly Duckling (Fresh Mode)5) Ma Dukes - O.C. (Word...Life)6) Keepin The Faith - De La Soul (De La Soul Is Dead)7) Award Tour - Tribe Called Quest (Anthology)8) Funky Child - Lords of the Underground (Here Come The Lords)9) Supa Star - Group Home (Livin' Proof)10) Anywayz - Esthero (Breath From Another)11) You Don't - Tricky (Maxinquae)12) Rock the Set - Brand Nubian (In God We Trust)13) Right Here - Pharoahe Monch (Internal Affairs)14) Impress the Kid - Slick Rick (Art of Storytelling)15) What a Thug About - Beannie Sigel (Truth)16) That Aint Gangsta - 50 Cent (Power of the Dollar)17) Simon Says - Pharoahe Monch (Internal Affairs)18) Money or Love - Saukrates (Vol. 1-Underground Tapes)IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THESE SONGS, LIKE I WAS, DON""T GET THIS CD."
4,2nd Unit Purchased,I bought the same unit about 5 years ago (still working) but needed a new remote handset as some of the numbers were sticking. The price for a new base unit from [...] was actually cheaper than just an additional handset from other sites. I really didn't want to go to a new 2 Line phone as this one is so easy to use.
1,liz,if you have friends who leave real long meassages on phones and you would like to avoid this this phone would be great it consistantly cuts people off after 5 or 8 words and the sound quality is pretty poor. the volume is usually so low and you can never tell how many message you have or erase a skipped messsage you have to hear all your annoying message first. I just bought this a couple of months ago and am now planning on replacing it.
5,America!!!! Finally catching up,"Firts word that comes to mind...Wow. This is one of the best cds that I picked up lately. If you party and listen to Sasha, Digweed, Seaman then you know what good quality music is. Chriss mixing is unbeliavable. This cd takes you on a ride that you will talk about with your friedns for a long time. Enjoy...Crazy People"
2,Regret this purchase.,"I wanted something that looked more formal/classic than a sports nylon pack. This is more casual than what I wanted. The material is a simple olive green, not as detailed and textured as the photo here. The lackluster color is very basic looking, and the cheapo plastic clips make it look like more of a costume piece than something I would want to use everyday. If your buying it for trips to the grocery store(its huge and very durable) its fine, but I probably will order something better suited for my purposes."
1,Not Your Source for a Solid Treatment of Dominican Spirituality,"Zagano selectively chooses aspects of Dominican spirituality that she likes in order to present an incomplete and, conveniently enough, in the end, a vergingly heterodox treatment of Dominican spirituality. For something more orthodox, I recommend William A. Hinnebusch's Dominican Spiritulity: Principles and Practice, which book may be found online here: [...]"
5,GREAT IRON!,"I have had this iron for over 2 years and I LOVE IT! It heats up very quickly, does a great job ironing , has a detachable water chamber for steam, and no cord to get in the way! After 2 years of almost every day use the plate is still perfectly clean and ironing is (almost) a pleasure :)"
4,Great iron,This is a great iron..i got it mainly because of the cordless function...yes ..havin no cord to maneuver helps....but really not that big a difference as i do have to keep reheating it on the warming plate...which works really well..hence u have to have the base unit around always...one good thing is i can use it even on y curtains...and valence sheets...the steam is excellent...powerful like no other iron i have had this far..its also light and comes in a nice cute box to store...If i had to change one thing ..that wud be to not have to reheat it every so often...but the pros of this iron are many..i hope panasonic reads our feedback to come up with a product that maybe works on charged batteries or somethin and still is powerful.
5,Great Iron,"Great Iron. Love the convenience of loosing the cord. Iron stays hot and produces great steam. Took a while to get in the habit of setting it back on the deck instead of sitting it on it's end as with a corded, but no big deal. Didn't realize when purchased that the iron itself had no battery and didn't actually produce the heat. I was a little concerned about this when I first realized this but it actually works very well like this and I don't have to worry about replacing rechargeable battery packs. My only complaint is that the automatic shutoff never completely shuts off. It goes to a standby mode which still produces heat and I still have the nagging worry of -did I unplug the iron?? that I was looking forward to eliminating with an automatic shut off model. Oh well, overall it is still a great iron."
2,"A ""work"" of fiction","I haven't quite finished this book yet, but what I've read thus far is maybe 10% fact and 90% fiction. Sure, making up stories about links to famous people makes for more interesting reading, but personally I'd be more interested in hearing the real story. It becomes a lot more readable once he gets to the AWA years. Not the worst book on pro-wrestling by far, but not in the top 50% either. Oh, and I'm not impressed that relatives were able to get signed copies. LOL."
3,A middling entry into the catalog,"While this one isn't the disaster that I originally thought it would be when I saw that the band covered ""We Gotta Get Outta This Place"", it isn't exactly a masterpiece either. ""Did You Hurt Somebody"" and ""Standing Over You"" would both make any Angels compilation I'd ever make, with ""Can't Take Anymore"" and ""Man There"" sliding in as alternates, but overall this collection is a fairly tepid addition to the excellent early Angels catalog. Not easy to track down, but at the same time not vital."
2,Failed attempts at updating her sound,"Firstly, it's remarkable that A&R thought that Georgia Gibbs could return to the charts in 1967. ""Time will tell"" is a B-list song from Neil Sedaka with a faux rock backing. Grating. ""Where's the music coming from"" is more interesting. The producers tried for a Petula Clark-like arrangement, and Georgia plays (sings) along as best she can. It probably should have been the plug side."
5,She is very enjoyable,"I really like this tape. It's very hard if you want it to be. She is the least cutesy instructor. I loved it. She didn't chat unnecessarily. No screaming, no woo woos. Exactly what I wanted."
3,A little tricky and feels like forever,"This 50-minute workout feels like it, but it still does the job. You need more space than usual for this one because she has you running around the step as well as the typical maneuvers. I don't like this one as much as others because it has a little too much activity off the step for my tastes. Some of the steps will be challenging for novice users, although the overall routine is not too difficult."
1,rip off,"If you are expecting to see good looking naked guys, then try something else. You will see naked guys but also boring queens running the show. Save your money or rent it some place before you purchase. I wish I had done that."
3,contrived,"The writing is good but as you read the charachters are more and more contrived. The situation is contrived, the situations are contrived. It seems more a book about Florida, indians, and environmental issues than a real story. I think the author knows how to put words together but doesn't have a solid charachter development to go with them.So many author's spend a lot of time making a book length story out of a short story. A book is intended to tease out the charachters and make you feel something about them."
4,Good historical approach for a short ethics course,"For college students that don't have much time for a lot of reading, this text offers a nice summary of the key philosophical views from the ancients to Rorty and Gilligan. It presents them in a no nonsense historical progression. Some short original paragraphs are included."
4,The story of Ethics: Fulfilling our Human Nature,I found the book to be very interesting. It really opened up my understanding to Philosophy and how I think about happiness and what it means to be ethical. A very good read.
4,A hands-on class,"The book can be thought of as a project development class. By using a hands-on approach, step by step, the author goes through the main issues in developing a project like this. By using plain english, the stuff is easy to read and well organized. The level is attainable to all readers no matter their previous level in the topic. The four stars classification comes from the lack of some deeper study in some areas which is necessary for kicking off facilities like this."
3,Good but it just broke!,I love how it makes my hair look. But I have only used it 3 times since I bought it and it broke on me. the clip that makes it move up and down is dis-positioned. So now its totally worthless.
3,lazy,I don't like to spend a lot of time on my hair and this product is an easy way to fix my hair when I want to style it different and don't want to spend forever curling it with hot rollers or a curling iron.
1,Terrible!,"In the section on pronouns him is refered to as him in English and Italian. The English speaker keeps saying ""Real Good! He uses very poor English. Only Anna, the Italian speaker, saves these tapes from the trash can!"
3,"Interesting beginning, quirkily charming.","Hakase Mizuki, The Demon Ororon, vol. 1 (Tokyopop, 1999)Fun little book, this, with engaging (if somewhat primitive) artwork. Storyline is a touch confusing, but as I read more manga, I've cone to see that's actually the norm for the first volume in any given series. Basic premise is simple: can a demon and a half-angel live in peace with one another, and without their various friends, familiars, and hangers-on killing one another? The thing that really gets me about this one is how different the artwork looks from most manga I've read. None of the androgynous, huge-eyed stereotypes here, which means that some of the characters are actually cute. Not a bad beginning at all. ***"
4,Good Sandal,I wanted a rugged and good looking sandal an this meats both the criteria. Have already got good feedbacks from people that it looks good :)
1,Bad charger,"This charger literally boils batteries. The batteries get extremely hot while charging, almost too hot to touch. With my old charger (an ancient Radioshack charger), the batteries would last about 5 years and would never get hot. With this one, I'm lucky if I get even 6 months. I am using the same brand batteries as this charger (Duracell). I'm back to using the old charger, and I've had to replace the batteries that were fried by this charger. Stay away from 15 minute chargers at all costs and get a charger that takes at least 2 hours, and make sure it has an automatic shut-off (not just a timer) to prevent overcharging. If you need fresh batteries immediately, get a second set of rechargeables so you'll always have a charged set. It's worth it to wait two hours to keep your batteries in good condition."
2,The charger needs recharging,"After using this for a year or a bit more with great success, the unit would no longer charge the batteries and kept running indefinitely. I called Duracell and received a coupon for a new charger, which also did not work correctly. They do get points for having good customer service."
4,Works wonderfully!,We have one of these at work to use for our cameras - which we need to have at a moment's notice as we use them to gather evidence. This charger works wonderfully and I'm glad to find one for my own home use!
5,Canvas German Style Alpine Rucksack,"I couldn't be more pleased with my Rucksack. The canvas is soft and sturdy and not dry as described in a previous review. I use my rucksack daily and am able to carry many items in this bag. It is one of the more comfy back packs when carrying large or small amounts of things. It is also comfy material wise, compared to several vintage rucksacks and military bread bags I have, which often have a stiff quality to the canvas and a moldy smell."
3,Author is judgmental,"I thought I would really enjoy this book. I've read a lot of royal history and was familiar with most of the people mentioned herein. However, I thought the author's writing style was judgmental. To keep harping on the ""wages of sin"" was annoying -- she made more judgments about these women than perhaps their contemporaries did. And the end section, the interview with her, made me ill. To advise women to behave like the royal mistresses -- well, it irritated me. The author was a bit full of herself in this last section, so I tore it out. The rest of the book, while organized poorly and written in an over-the-top manner, with tons of unsupported assumptions, was fun to read, and I'll keep it."
2,"Dishy, but certainly not academic","While the book is a 'fun' read, the author is certainly not an academic. I had no problems with the way her book was laid out, as some have complained -- it was thematic, so it would have made little sense to tell story after story of random mistress -- the way she did it was preferable to that. The author's citing is sparse so it seems as though there is no credible source for some story or fact. Additionally, her sources are all secondary, so she's positing theories based on other academics work/theories. While the subject is one of interest to many, of course, I do hope Ms. Herman does not consider herself an academic or historian, as she certainly is not that."
1,Save yourself a few bucks and borrow it from the library....,"Because I'm going to be donating it the next time I clear off my bookshelves. This book had a pretty good start, but became increasingly painful to read. I put it down halfway through and haven't bothered to pick it back up.As someone already noted, the author does not stick to any sort of chronological order. At any given paragraph, expect to be dragged out of the 16th century, plopped down in the 19th century, only to be abruptly yanked back into the 16th century, but in someone else's court. It's confusing, it's annoying, it's infuriating, and ultimately, it's a turn-off. Which is a pity, because she really does seem to have done her research, gathered a lot of racy, delicious, sometimes malicious details, but has managed to turn it into so much air-headed fluff.I consider this book several hours of my life that I will never get back...."
3,"Sex, lies, but no videotape...","I had been waiting to read this book for ages, but I never seemed to have the time. Also, I was afraid it might be terribly dry. However, for the most part, I found it interesting and informative. Herman not only introduces us to a fascinating array of ladies, but she also gives a glimpse of how difficult the life of a mistress could be, and in some cases, she actually -gasp- makes you feel for the women who could be tossed out as easily as yesterday's rubbish. The mistress is not portrayed as merely a sexual creature, even as the suggestive title of the book may suggest. We see her as a wife (mistresses were not always single!), a mother (hello royal bastards!), and as a rival (to the queen). While not the best history book I read, it certainly was entertaining in its' own right."
1,Not Worth the effort or expense!,"I had read the book ""Sex with the Queen"" by the same author and had really enjoyed the book. I was looking forward to reading this book too. However, the book was not an interesting read. The store line was dull and uninteresting and so repetitive. I guess the ladies had more interesting lives than the men. I think the book--in the reviews- is overrated. I read the reviews but I wish I had passed on this book. Not worth the time or the money."
4,Interesting Historical read,"It was sometimes difficult to follow as the times and people changed so much with the way the book was organized, however, that being said I would recommend this book to any European history buffs."
3,Sybarite - 'Musicforafilm' (Temporary Residence) 3 1/2 stars,"This CD release is the one-man project of Xian Hawkins,a multi-instrumentalist for the Silver Apples,I'm assuming when they reunited in the later '90's.Disc's fourteen tracks starts out a bit slow,but eventually the music evolves into something quite beautiful.After the third listen,I realized just what a decent piece of electronic wizardry that 'Music For A Film' really is.Very well assembled,I must say."
3,Good for a disciplined reader.,"This book was used for my old testament class at Liberty university. I have to say that it has a lot of good information but as an undergraduate introductory class, it was way to much. If you are doing serious study or any heavy academic work I think this would be a good book. However, if you are just wanting a solid book to get a basic picture of the OT save your money and get something else. If you want a book that will put you to sleep at night than I suggest getting this one."
4,If the roller worked it'd be perfect!!,The product itself workd great once I was able to get it out of the bottle. The roller ball doesn't work properly in mine. It took some work to get it going. Otherwise I am satisfied with the product.
1,poor product/ poor service,"received Disney toy story figuerine set, opened very poorly made the two main figuerines DO NOT stand up, put everything back in the package to return, have emailed ABCtoy4me customer service on two seperate occasions to get correct method to return item, no response, also tried calling x3,they are never there.i am very UNHAPPY with the service and the product..........."
4,Good movie,"A classic actor that portrays a bad guy role very entertainingly. The film stars Vinod Khanna whom i was not that much a fan of but he did do some good acting in this film. Shutrungh Sinha is a actor i always hated apart from Amitabh movies he co starred in and Khudgarz. After watching this film, i have to be honest and say he can do comedy and is not that bad of a actor when he wants to be. Zeenat Aman is a talented actress and is very sexy and beautiful in this film. This film is like a comedy love triangle between the three stars, with a lot of humour, action and some good family melodrama added in. The movie is about the two thief buddies who find a little girl whom they consider will bring them fortune as she is a rich mans daughter and later bond with. This is a good film"
5,Excellent resource,Outstanding. I'm currently an MBA student and I bought this book right before starting business school. I'd suggest that anyone about to start business school ought to read this book.
2,don't get this twisted...,"Livio shouldn't be confused with the under. At least thats impression i got. I downloaded all the tracks based on these reviews expecting some dope ish, only to be disappointed to find he would fit right in with the trash that infests the airways and mtv to date. The beats are weak too fast and full of beepin and clickin. I may be a little to critical of this but i had to balance out these inflated reviews. To his credit for his age he does have some lyrical skill, but not enough to buy anything with his name on it.~peace"
4,GREAT CD,"If you're looking for something that's not boring as hell, you'll like this. I NEVER review anything EVER, but this was good enough to review. If you're into tracks that are ""head bobbers"", like beat styles that include for eg: roscoe - cali in the summertime, 2pac - god bless the dead, tech n9ne - walk these shoes, etc......those good, hard hittin, smacking sounding snare beats that make you bob your head. You'll like this. Very good lyrically too. Not cheesy at all. Listen to it, you'll like it if you know what good rap is."
2,The Antidepressant Solution,"This book has some good suggestions. It is written by telling, ""Jane's story"" and ""Mary's story"" etc. etc. I personally find this annoying, especially considering how varied antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is for each individual. Also, the ""tapering"" or ""wean"" schedules/recommendations are only good if you live in the US and maybe the UK. Many of the medications recommended to assist you in tapering off your specific medication are not available in the immediate release/ liquid formulations here in Canada. Therefore, when you ask your physician to taper slower it may be a pharmacological impossibility!! If you are Canadian, don't bother buying this book...try to find it at the library if you want to view its content."
3,Depressingly Repetitive,"This book can drive you to despair. I should have waited for the Cliffs Notes. I'm sure there's valuable information here, but digging it out is so difficult. It's not that it's written expressly for professionals - it isn't. But hanging in there for the valuable kernels has me feeling like a starving chicken."
2,disappointed with kindle edition,"The tables - such as 6.2 which has recommended dosage reductions for the most popular SSRI's is too small to read and my Kindle does not enable me to enlarge the table so that it is readable. It just becomes pixels, like zooming in on a digital photo. My Kindle for PC reader did not improve the issue either. I recommend buying this item in traditional paper format."
5,Caramel dream,"My boyfriend and son can't get enough of these! I personally don't like caramel, but they practically race each other to the box. They're each getting a box for xmas this year."
2,Clothes hard to get off and NO BACKPACK,Product is average...On ours the button whole is sewed so tight even I have problems buttoning... impossible for my 20 month old. It says clothes remove fully and easily... which I thought would be great for my daughter since she likes to try and dress things... but the pullover has to be removed by pulling over the head and it isn't easy... and again is almost impossible for a little one. Also... ours didn't come with a back pack which I'm sure would have made the toy more fun! Perhaps she'll gain interest and capability with the toy in months to come... but right now... she has about as much interest in it as she does in say... carpet.
4,Taz - Somethings never change,"Tom Browning was one of the nicest guys in college.The few pros I've met who played with him or knew him well always agree.While not a literary classic, this book is pure Browning - always said from the heart and with that sheepish grin.The image of flannel shirt, down vest, spit cup with a chaw enlarged smile shines through the pages.It was fanTAZtic!"
1,Wrong product,I ordered 2 cases of the Monty's green sauce which I love but I was sent another Monty's sauce. Too much trouble (glass) to send it back. Won't order anything again from this Amazon supplier.
5,Very good!,"I liked her because she was so honest and loving with her listeners, she wanted them to know God and tried to help them know better. I would recommend this book."
4,Sql for eServer i5 and iSeries,We are new to SQL and have found this book to be invaluable. Especially when added to some other books we have. Kevin has gone out of his way to answer questions and help. This is a must have book for any iSeries Shop that is using SQL and Embedded SQL.
3,Good for backup,"After the delivery, I found the HDD case (the product itself) was bigger than I expected, however, the running noise is acceptable for me. The attached Retrospect Backup Software is good because my Japanese Mac OS X Tiger shows Japanese menus and labels! I had quite a little trouble with installing the backup software at first because I made a call for support and had to download a patch from Western Digital site if we install the backup software to Mac OS X Tiger."
5,chickenstripezz,"i like it, nice DVD. Came in very very quick less than i expected. its has Big Time Pilot which i didn't expect. Good present for kids who love BTR and i carly"
5,"Great Quality, Worth the Money","We buy these Retriever Rolls for our two labs. One is a strong chewer (75 pound female, and when I say strong I mean the only thing she does not destroy in one sitting are the black Kongs) and the other not so much (100 pound male). We love that these are made in the USA from American cattle. These are the longest lasting raw hides that we have come across, but unlike other reviews they do not last day/weeks with our dogs. Our female will normally finish hers in an hour and a half to 2 hours and our male in 3 hours (he gets tired and needs to take breaks). Although our female does not take that long to finish these she is exhausted once she is finished (a rarity) and will usually nap. These are so tightly bound that she has to really work to unravel it and then chew it. I definitely recommend this as a treat for anyone with a power chewer that is just looking to keep their dog occupied and happy for a few hours."
1,It cant be programmed with out the computer:(,So i have a 2001 Suzuki GRand vitara and i tryed to program it but I can't do it personally. I have to go to the dealership.
4,Historical Romance with a Caribbean flavour,"Belgrave's Ti Marie is a well researched, beautifully written, historical romance which gives the reader a great insight into the social culture of plantation society in Trinidad during the 18th Century. The book's truth to historical facts in no way diminishes the flow of the language and the development of the characters which together make for an enjoyable read.The book gives valuable insights into many of the characteristics of Trinidad today. Issues such as race, colour and class still permeate the daily lives of Trinidadians and as such it is a useful tool in any in depth social study of today's Post-Colonial Caribbean society."
4,Pretty good text for Space Environment Interactions,"I wouldn't call this text amazing, but it is certainly adequate. I used this book for a graduate level course in space environment interactions mostly because there was a lack of other resources available. This book gives a decent overview, without getting too bogged down with the physics involved. However, the professor had to pull a large chunk of his material from other sources (out of print sources) because Tribble is a little to basic. As an aerospace engineer, I don't care so much about the EE stuff, so Tribble does a good job summarizing the EE physics. Overall, a sufficient reference that gives a good overview of s/c-environment interactions."
1,Maple syrup,"If anything, this collection proves that Canadians are incapable of coming up with a book called ""Inspirational Stories,"" by themselves.The same sappy formula, done for Canadians.Better off to chug maple syrup; you'd get the same effect, and once the syrup was gone, that would be it. But if you buy this book, it's unsuitable for both reading and eating, so, it's not a good idea."
4,Works Great,I bought these for the place where I work where we prepare a lot of fruit.The green one made really quick work of kiwi and the red one works well on mango.The only problem I would say is that the large orange one isn't as sturdy as the other ones.
4,Adequate fruit scoops,"I had a hard time finding these locally and eventually gave up and bought them here. I bought them primarily to scoop out young coconut flesh and for scooping out melons, etc. It works well on melon and kiwi, have not tried them on coconuts yet. They are constructed well and the plastic seems to be cast through the entire handle."
3,Expectations weren't met,"Because this advertised Oxy I expected a really clean, fresh scent and powerful cleaning. I got neither. Don't get me wrong, it works, but it works as well as the regular shampoo that comes with the carpet cleaner."
2,Oxy Carpet Detergent,Product is great but someone at Amazon didn't package this well so 2 of them spilled during shipping. Post office suggested contacting them. I did. They said they would send out 2 replacements but I never got them and I didn't take the time to call or email a 2nd time.
4,Useful and amusing,"We spent 6 days in Italy, and ended up only doing 2 of the walks (plus visited the site of a 3rd), but found this book a great resource for getting away from the crowds, without being in the back of beyond. It provided ideas for some truly unique places to go that weren't on the usual ""tourist's map"" of Italy. Also, one of the hotel recommendations in the beginning (there aren't many -- the book is not at all a comprehensive guide) was a great find. We did find at least one discrepancy in a trail marking (at the end of the Florence walk), so be alert and flexible!"
4,"My wife loved it, but it hurt her feet the first day","i bought these for my wife, she loved the shoes but the first day she wore them they really hurt her feet. I guess that is a normal thing with womes shoes according to her. I would have given them 5 stars, but the fact that they were uncomfortable the first day i gave them 4"
1,Product appears shipped broken,"This was a horrible experience. Bought this to prepare for Hurricane Irene and now I only have one day left to find a replacement because as soon as I opened the package I noticed the station dialer was broken and loose within the cavity. It appears very much as if it was shipped this way. I am very angry about this purchase because on top of this I have to pay for the return which is even more of an inconvenience and expense, regardless of any possibility of refund because judging from other remarks, this is not the first time this happened with the seller with other customers. Let it be another example to others to make sure they look at the other reviews before buying anything."
4,"Great price point, check assembly","This is a great price and a pretty good product. When I took the product out of the box, I heard a clinky rattle, like a screw was loose. Opening the case, I noticed a heat sink was out of place and causing the rattle. After reattaching the heat sink, the system powers up fine. I suspect to provide the supply at such a low price, final inspection and burn-in testing was limited.Otherwise, I am really happy with this product."
3,Good general purpose supply.,"My only complaint is that there is no fine tuning of the parameters. If you need precise voltages, get the single supply units which have coarse and fine adjustments for voltage and current."
4,It's not reality TV: it could be real life,"This book, part reality, part fiction--inspires us to imagine possibilities. It asks that we imagine what could happen if a sensible, farsighted and workable plan for meeting basic needs in the world's poorest nations were funded and implemented--a plan that also would offer our young men and women a chance to participate in a cooperative, meaningful, and enduring project. This is no mere fantasy; Zoglin's narrative voice is believable, her concern rings true, and her approach makes sense. All of us who refuse to give up on our humanity, who believe that the pen really is mightier than the sword--should read this book."
5,Absolutely Excellent,"The Barry Paris biography of Louise Brooks is a harrowing, riveting and brilliant recollection of an obscure but genius silent film star. The wit, venom and power of Louise Brooks as an author, actor, and person are brought to light in this accessible and entertaining book. It is the bible for all fans of Louise Brooks and should be required reading for anyone with an interest in Hollywood, silent film, dance, and the fine art of celebrity. If you have half a brain and can get one eye open, this is the book for you."
2,Don't buy the Kindle Edition! It has no pictures.,"This book is great, alone I would easily give it four stars. But the Kindle edition, which costs just about the same as the paper version has no photographs. So, all the writer's reference to hairstyles and her other graphics are not included here. As such, the Kindle version really should be a third of the price. Its a shame because other books on natural hair care DO have photos in the Kindle versions."
3,Very Informative,This book is very infomative but the author is slightly over the top with her spritual beliefs.
3,Not really much help.,"For someone who is already natural, and just looking to learn more about how to care for her hair, this book is rather disappointing. The author's basic message is to tell the reader what hair is, what it is made of, to be proud of our hair, and then to put it in the care of an trained professional. That didn't help me. Even the products that she recommends are expensive -- and I can't afford $15 shampoos and conditioners! She should tell readers which brands to buy in the drugstores and beauty supply stores, because we don't all have expensive personal stylists. My verdict: If you just want a little more knowledge, or if you don't know anything about natural hair at all, this book could be helpful. Otherwise, it didn't offer me anything at all useful, and it is no different from the other books out there."
1,trash,This book went too far into details of a persons sex life. I will give this book a zero rating. I wish I never bought the book. The only thing I will do with this book is burn it.
1,This is not the one,This is not a good self-help guide. It makes people with BPD seem like people are incapable of getting better. Skip this one.
3,"Basic, everyday self-help book.","This book is decent in the fact that covers a wide array of topics related to BPD. The problem I have with this book is that it does not expand on any new concepts or provide new insight or depth into BPD. What is covered is done nicely and neatly, but I was really hoping for something different. Not a bad book, a good place to start if you are researching BPD."
5,The best of the entry level digital frames.,"For a 5.6"" frame this product takes the cake. I researched a lot of frames to purchase as a Christmas gift and I settled on this one. It is 800x600, 4:3 ratio, not those annoying widescreen ones that resize your photos. Westinghouse is a great brand. Furthermore you get PC interaction with a USB cable (not included) so it's really easy to use. There is 8 MB of onboard memory to use, which can be a lot of 800x600 pictures. If you're not tech-inclined you probably shouldn't be considering digital frames anyways. If you are, this is a no brainer. Get this frame."
1,entry level with very little practical examples,"This book is e-commerce 101. Pages and pages of unneccessary code examples. Do you really need to see the code for a drop down box with all of the states? I was really hoping for this book to address real-world e-commerce programming issues. State management, multi-level departments, multiple-product photos, various shipping options, etc.If you have never written an e-commerce web site and you just need a basic shopping cart then this maybe the book for you."
5,Excellent show but wish it was 720P HD,"Loved the video but wish the streaming was of a high quality (i.e., 720p HD). I also have a IPAD2 and can't watch these movies on the IPAD due to the Flash Player requirement."
3,"Great Show, DVD Could Have Been Better","75th anniversary DVD could be better. I've seen the show several times and various productions, in NY and traveling shows. Here's what was missing: Rockettes in their famous santa suits and the full on pageantry of the living Nativity. The DVD live Nativity number was the shortest I've ever scene. I'm just saying, for the 75th anniversary they should have gone all out. Now, what could be lessened: the way too many shots of the audience's faces. A few children's excited faces would be a nice touch once or twice, but through the entire production?The producers of the DVD should have taken more time to plan & really, really showcase 'The Christmas Spectacular'. If you don't plan on seeing the show live, the DVD will do nicely."
1,"yeah this thing pretty much sucks. juice doesn't seem to come ot of the front but the back, maybe i'm not using it right...","juice doesn't seem to come ot of the front but the back, maybe i'm not using it right...doesn't matter now cause it's in the trash can."
2,Not so great for the money,"The shipping process was amazing but the product isnt. It's pretty cheap for the amount of money that we spent on it. The clap to hold the unit down while ""juicing"" sticks out so far that you can not use the crank. We had one person holding the unit down and bucket in place while the other person turned the crank. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I will be returning it."
4,get high,At first i didn't like it.the instructions were not so good and then i saw a video on youtube on how to use it.And so now i can say i like it it works pretty good and is easy to clean.but if i had to do it again i would buy the electric one. but this one might squeeze more grass out then the electric one.It is definatley worth the money for sure.
1,piece of JUNK!!!,"I bought this for what it says its for.......A Wheat Grass juicer, after going through 2 containers of wheat grass, I got about a tablespoon of juice! and that was hard! I guess you get what you pay for!Healthy Juicer - Manual Hand Powered Wheatgrass Juicer - Wheat grass juicer"
1,A Rock Juces Better,"Excuse me rock, im gunna let you finish, but Healthy Juicer Manual Hand Powered Wheatgrass Juicer is the worst Juicer of all time, OF ALL TIME!!!(minutes later Healthy Juicer Manual Hand Powered Wheatgrass Juicer's name was read as the over all winner of the worst juicer award, and rock only got the the worst in the light colored category)"
1,Terrible Juicer,This product is awful. The plastic auger produces the smallest amount of wheatgrass you could imagine. I would put in a whole 4 x 4 tray of wheatgrass to obtain a quarter of a shot (which is a generous approximation). That is about 0.4 ounces. You would be better off buying shots at Jamba Juice every day.
1,not a good wheat grass juicer,"There are several compliants about this hand crank wheat grass juicer. The suction doesn't always secure on the countertop,juice gets on the countertop and floor, the crank is hard to crank at times and wheatgrass gets stuck while cranking. I attempted to use it many times and was wasting the wheatgrass and my time. The clean up is a mess. DOn't waste your money."
1,Total waste of money.,"We were so excited to get this juicer, as we just began drinking wheatgrass. My Husband followed all the directions, and put it together perfectly (he's an engineer by the way, so he's awesome at putting things together). We literally couldn't get one drop of wheatgrass juice out of this juicer. Well I should re-phrase that. We got juice leaking out of it from all the WRONG places, but nothing from the appropriate place. We could hardly even crank it! This thing was immediately sent back, and I wouldn't even recommend it to someone I don't like. We ended up getting a Miracle Juicer Model MJ-550, and it works awesome!Don't waste your time and money. Get an electric juicer. You'll thank yourself in the long run."
1,Be Weary of Buying From Jasmine Johnson!,"Jasmine has great reviews, except for mine. I don't know if something happened to her, but she hasn't responded to one email, and still hasn't shipped my book (today's the last of the estimated delivery days). I'm so upset! I paid to have shipping expedited and its not even in the mail :(."
5,Great for my 2 year 3 month old daughter,"Love this product. I got this form my little one in June 2012 and it is now December and she still plays with it (she is now 2 years 9 months). She moves the pieces around and like to see the patterns she can make. There is one piece that making a clicking noise when the tiny battery powered motor is running. I took that piece out of the mix one day because I could not make a phone call with the clicking noise in the background. She does not play with it every day now, but she does move it back and forth from the refrigerator to the dishwasher. I have not had to replace the batteries I placed in it in 6 months. Buying another one today for my niece that just turned 2."
1,Somewhat misleading presentation,"This CD is not an audio book. It's an amateurish series of interviews with Thomas Stanley on how to try and sell things to rich people. This recording seems very uncharacteristic for Stanley because he has written some good books about millionaires and personal finance. By contrast, these recording has a ""sleazy salesman"" feel and the scripted questions asked by the interviewer are laughable. Stick to Stanley's other books."
2,36 turned out to be 6 in my case,"Well I got refunded the money, but still kind of annoying that I didn't get what the description said. They're decent bags though I guess, they fit the vacuum and they hold dirt..."
1,WORST Camera,"This camera was a gift. The first camera didn't seem to be formatted correctly so we took it back & got another one to replace it.We had trouble from day one. It EATS batteries, I use rechargeable batteries. At first I thought something was wrong with the batteries so I purchased a different brand of rechargeable batteries, it didn't change a thing. I take 5 pictures & Camera tells me batteries are low & it won't process or perform after that. Clarity is a problem as well. I spent 5 hours on the phone with several Techs in India, what a joke!SAVE YOUR MONEY & DO NOT WASTE IT ON THIS CAMERA!!!!"
1,cheapo,"Everything about this product screamed ""cheap""! The plastic was too thin and made the thing feel like a child's toy. There was no detail to the finish. Looks nice from afar but is far from nice!"
2,Not What I EXpected,"First off, I got to say this was not worth the money I spent for it.'Will Rap For Food' gave me the impression that it was a rap group saying how they were broke because they were so much different. I was wrong. This was pretty much the same filth you would hear on MTV. It was better than that, but not much better. Though there were some brightspots that actually worth the dollar you spend on a blank cd to copy it from a friend. Mic Like a Memory was my favorite track and Thugged since cub scouts was by far the worst track on the cd.All in all I was disappointed, but perhaps because I expected something much different. It's not worth the money to buy it but it is worth a listen."
4,bosch o2 sensor,This product was perfect fit and works great. I have noticed an improvement in gas mileage and the way my car runs
2,Digitally Mastered? come on....,"I bought the reissue of this DVD thinking it would be better than the prior versions released during the past few years. What a disappointment! The image is grainy, white speckled, blurry, a complete mess. This film hasn't been restaured AT ALL. The ironic part is that the back cover DVD claims this to be a Digitally Mastered picture. It couldn't be further away from the truth. I just don't understand why so many studios insist in releasing this Picture without attempting to restaure its image.The movie itself is very good, not as good as the book as usual but worth watching. Philip Carey falls in love with a vulgar waitress. This love leads to the character's emotional destruction. A love addiction per say.So far so good. The problem is the image quality which is so annoying it doesn't do the film any justice. Please someone let me know if there is a better version of this picture around."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"I sure bought the advertising hype, but have to say that the quality of this book seriously detracts from the effectiveness. The book appears to be a photocopy of a hand-typed 1970s manuscript. Some of the typefaces don't match up. The pages weren't even printed in the correct order so I had to scramble to find the continuity. Jumping back and forth to go through the first couple chapters was almost enough to make me give up. The pronunciation guide is also weak (not explaining how to pronounce common combinations of letters.) That said, the exercises ARE okay and the grammatical explanations are easy to follow. The major exception to that is the usage of the Italian articles for ""the""and ""a"" which was sorely lacking. The vocabulary is fairly limited but is presented in a logical fashion. I think someone needs to edit this book and put in some quality checks. I wouldn't recommend this book, or its supposed ""method."""
4,Good value,"I've only used this pan a few times. So far it has performed well for pan of its kind. The non-stick surface works well. However, since the pan is quite thin, the bottom of the baked good tends to brown very quickly, sometimes before the center is done. So baking time needs to be adjusted. Placing a cookie sheet underneath the pan might prevent browning too soon."
2,it's nice - when it works,"This is one of the worst purchases I've made in recent years. I have to return it every few months, as it keeps finding new ways to break...I regret this purchase and I should have followed others advise in similar reviews that I had read. But, at the same time - it's really good looking and I really like it when it does work. The screen is very crisp and the menu is very easy to navigate. One problem with the design is that the record button is right where your index finger would naturally rest, so I'm constantly recording things on accident."
5,Very soft and plush!,"This is a cradle/basinet mattress cover. It was the exact size I needed and very soft and plush for a baby's skin. My order was processed and I received it quickly, sooner than I expected. It was very affordable and a great purchase!"
3,"Cuts great, but very difficult to clean","Maybe this is true of all pizza wheels. I don't know, because this is the only one I have ever owned.It cuts pizza great, but cleaning the pizza off the wheel can be a real."
3,Takes for ever to soak the tannis out,"I have had these in water since i first received them and i replace it with super hot water every night. They are still turning the water tan and it doesn't seem to be letting up any time soon. :/The piece i got wasn't too exciting, but it isn't bad looking either."
1,Disappointing,I bought this for my ball python to climb on. The picture displays a beautiful branch. What I got was a flat piece of wood. It is unusable for my python and won't fit in the 55 gal tank. I'm very disappointed and won't be buying anything like this again.
5,if you want to be great then be humble and serve,This really has had an impact on how I see being a servant to others and not thinking more of myself than I should. All persons in leadership should read this book and use it as a reference in how they lead and teach others by example.
4,Challenging book from Bill Hybels,"Hybel's book will challenge the average Christian, like it did me. The book focuses on Phillipians 2 (one of my favorite passages) which Hybel uses to show the journey of the downward path to greatness that Jesus followed. Hybel believes that those who choose to follow Jesus should follow the same path. He showcases his points through vignettes of everyday people.Although the writing is not the best, the points made in the book are very important. Personally I felt challenged by every chapter. And I think the conclusions he draws are true. We must give up our life to gain it. An ageless message that still rings true today.I highly recommend this book to anyone in Christian ministry. The message is simple, but needs to be heard, and revisited on a regular basis."
4,How to harness unhealthy pride. Man's worst enemy.,"Have you ever wondered why ""Pride"" is the ""Chief Sin""?Ever ask yourself why It is discussed in The Holy Bible hundreds and hundreds of times? The greatest among us down through all of human history mastered ""Descending Into Greatness"" through the conscious development of self-less-ness over self-ish-ness. Look at Mother Teresa of Calcutta, John Paul II, and Jesus The Christ.A great little book with solid value for everyone alive.Deacon Rev Lawrence L. Ruehlen"
1,advertising error,"The product as advertised has a 5/8"" arbor. The actual product shipped has a 10mm arbor. Happened twice."
3,Nook not secure in case (after 1 month of use),"I liked the case when I got it. However, I found after a month the nook was no longer being securely held in place. I have not seen this complaint before. This defeated the purpose of using a case in the first place.PS Hopefully, mine was just from a bad batch. (purchased 11/2010)"
5,great nook case,This Nook leather case is excellent. The Nook fits perfectly in the case and the case is of good quality.
4,NOOK - FIRST GENERATION COVER,Very happy with the cover. Fit perfect and now my mom will be more likely to use her Nook if she can take it with her.
4,Perfecto para el Nook.,"He comprado este producto para proteger mi nook y poder transportarlo sin el miedo a rayones involuntarios.Definitivamente tiene un calce perfecto para el nook y se siente de buena calidad, cubre las partes más sensibles del e-reader y tiene un pequeño compartimento para almacenar alguna que otra hoja o algo parecido.La entrega fue rápida y aunque todavía no sometí al producto a mucho stress, creo que podrá con mis exigencias.Observación: No le doy 5 estrellas porque tengo que probarlo por mayor tiempo. Estaré actualizando el estado del producto en unos meses."
1,Not for Nook Color,"Unfortunately, this case isn't for the Nook Color. Nowhere does it say that. If you go to the BoxWave website, it says it's for the 1st edition Nook. Amazon needs to put that somewhere in their description of the product. Highly dissapointed since it was a gift and now I have to pay to ship it back."
2,"So Disappointed, but an Extra Star for the Characters","I liked The Talisman pretty well, though I felt it fell far from Stephen King's standards, so I went on to read Black House. I was hugely disappointed. I stuck with it because I liked Jack Sawyer, and generally liked the other characters, like Henry Layton and Dale Gilbertson. But otherwise I hated this book. I hated the obnoxious ""We are here and now we are going there"" narration style, so different from the narrative style of The Talisman. I hated the huge difference from the original Territories, no doubt caused by the uncomfortable attempt to meld King's Dark Tower world with this one. I now feel that if you've read The Talisman and liked it, you should definitely stay away from this sequel. It neither feels like a true sequel nor delivers like one. There are better ways to spend your reading time."
1,disappointing,"I really loved the Talisman. I think it was one of the better books Stephen King has written. This was such a disappointing sequal I don't care if I read another book or short story by SK or Straub. The writing is good as usual but the story drags on for hundreds of pages until a feeble plot emerges and the writers, it seems just wanted to end the story in a hurry. Do yourself a favor and go read a cookbook it will be more entertaining."
1,ICK......I couldn't even get half-way through it!!!!,"""Black House"" was a screwball interpretation of something I have no clue about. I just could not get into the book....maybe i needed to read ""The Dark Tower"" series first. Lately, however, King's books have been tedious to read....I didn't even finish the part where the boy was taken...i just couldn't stay interested. I hope King goes back to his writing of days gone by......Cujo, Pet Semetary, etc......books that were worthy of his name!!!!!"
1,Black House,"Ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up. I first bought the book, 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on, so i bought the audiobook (5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on).Now im stephen kings No1 fan and have loved the majority of his work, the talisman for me was a fantastic bolt on to the dark tower quest. So naturally i thought this would be the same.The book is one of the slowest drawn out books ive ever came accross, not a patch on previous work. I forced myself through the book expecting more, and im sorry to say this one doesnt deliver on any horror, excitment etc, do yourself a favour, get a tin of paint and watch it dry - more happens in that and at a much quicker pace than it does in this book.This book is for die hard fans only... but even diehards will find this a chore!"
1,Black House,A total waste of money and time. It kills brain cells trying to read it. Avoid it at all costs - spend your money elsewhere. After reading 50 pages I threw it away
4,the king of pop culture and the use of straub,"have you ever noticed how much pop culture references king can pack into a book? luckily we have straub to hold him back a little.it's supposed to be a sequal to the talisman, but the two aren't really connected. you get to meet some new great characters and some new annoying one. the most irritating is the narrator, who is an entitiy in this book. the whole first section, some hundred plus pages, is a waste of paper. it would be a great (though endless) camera shot. but this isn't a movie. it's a book. the end is a bit of a letdown. i hate it when an author creates miracles just to save the good guys and take care of the bad guys. but the middle is entertaining. we should just really wait for king to finish his dark tower series (i do wonder how straub feels at being used as a device for king's dark tower series). really, was there a point to straub here at all?"
4,"Great followup to The Talisman, worthy Dark Tower entry","As some are complaining about here, this is a Dark Tower novel. I think it is becoming clear that most, if not all, of King's novels concern the dark tower in one way or the other. Maybe not the early ones except by association of characters, but the later ones certainly are. Insomnia, Hearts in Atlantis, and now Black House are all adding to the mythology surrounding Roland's quest for the Dark Tower. In that respect this book is a slam dunk. It brings back characters and refernces events in Dark Tower as well as The Talisman. However the prose is a bit difficult at times with its detached quality and it works to take you out of the story by talking directly to you. It can be distracting but the story and payoff are worth it in the end. Bring on Dark Tower V!"
2,Disappointing at best,"This is the single most disappointing Steven King book I have read. The characters don't make you wonder about them anytime during or after the story. The most unsettleing thing for me was how the same scene would be told over again from the viewpoint of up to four different characters. I thought this seems like an attempt to just make a long 600+ page book out of a 180 page book. The worst part about the entire book however, was the blatant, graphic violence towards children.To get me back in the Steven King frame of mind, I'll need to make a quick read of The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.My advice, stay away from Black House. It's bad....bad I tell you!"
3,NOT FINISHED YET,"I love The Talisman...one of my favorite books of all time. I am not finished with Black House yet..keyword ""yet""..it had better move along and pick up...I am just past the tour of the ""Black House""...all I can say is if things don't progress soon, I'd through with this book. I had no idea that the Dark Tower was involved until I read some reviews...so far I am very disappointed...will check back in as I (IF I) get further along."
1,Black House,This is the worst book I have read in quite a while. I love King's work but most of this is just pointless and a waste of time
3,"Slow start, but in the end, a good read!","This book pretty much sucked at first because the first 250 pages were boring. After that, however, the book seemed to speed up be on its way. I liked it a lot."
3,pretty good!,well I thought the book was pretty good and kind ofcreepy.I recommend this book to horror buffs andto people who like a good scare!
1,An Effort to Read,"I have avoided King's books for many years after being repeatedly disappointed that they were not up to his earlier work. I caved in this time and was sorry I did. The book was an effort to get through. I ended up skimming towards the end just to get it over with. Did not care about the characters, the plot (I think it had one), and was ticked off I wasted money once again. It will not happen again."
1,Terrible,"I love Mr. King's books, but it may be time to retire if this is the best he can do now. I read 40 pages before I got so bored that I started skimming over pages. Finally, I just gave up."
3,"Umm, I liked it but....","Overall, Black House swept me in and kept me reading but I have a couple problems with it. For those who love The Talisman, the style of storytelling is quite different; King and Straub actually talk to the reader, which kind of hinders the book in places. I did like the book, but at far as a true sequel to the Talisman goes, I was disappointed. I enjoyed it not following the same formula as The Talisman and going a more eerie route. The characters in this book are more thought out than in the Talisman and more enjoyable, especially Henry the blind man, but I was especially disappointed that the climax was rather anti-climatic. Add in a bitter twist at the end and we are set up for another sequel. The Black Tower references were interesting but seemed to be incorporated for other reasons. Black House just seems like its purpose is to make people buy the Dark Tower books and wait for another sequel."
5,The Territories or Mid World?,"This book is unlike the Talisman in that it is not a ""Quest"" novel and doesn't really spend much time in the Territories that I loved so much in the Talisman. Nevertheless Black House is SK's (and Straub's) best book since I would say ""IT"" The characters are great, especially Henry. And the narration tool used is so ""god pounding"" great that I was really blown away! It was also interesting as this book had so much to do with the Dark Tower series, as I think most all future SK books will. So while a person can pick up ""Black House"" and enjoy it....please read ""The Talisman,"" all four Dark Tower Books, and for that matter ""Hearts in Atlantis"" before you read this. Thankee Sai."
3,I would have bought it anyway,"I only read the reviews after I read the book...and must say that I agree with one reviewer who stated that fans would buy the book despite any criticism from other reviewers.However, I was disappointed...there is no comparison to The Talisman beyond some of the characters. The sense of wonder Jack feels in the Territories; the feeling of being in on a frightening, amazing adventure; and for the most part, the character development are missing here. I stopped reading Stephen King's books when I felt they became more horrific than enjoyable, but immediately had to buy this, the sequel to one of my favorite novels of all time.Can't say I really regret it, because I'd have been wondering what I was missing, but still, paid too much money for this one."
3,"I still love King, but this....","I am giving this 3 stars because it actually starts off really strong (very different writing style, but very strong writing). It's interesting, because Dreamcatcher also started off strong and gave into...hmm...slippage? Yes, there was a lot of slippage in Black House...I still have about 100 pages to go, but have no desire to finish reading them. This is in complete contradiction to the King stories that I loved; such as IT, the Talisman, Insomnia, Hearts in Atlantis, etc. I feel bad being critical of King - so much of what he has done is wonderful - and can only hope that he takes his time on the next novel. I couldn't care less what happens to Roland at this point; give us another IT, and I think we'd all be happy."
2,TOO TOO Expensive at Amazon,Check your local discount stores and groceries. I can get this in NC for about $11 for 100 oz. bottle.
1,TRULLY DISAPPOINTING: You will receive a different product,"The bottle shown in the description is not what was sent to me. They promote and describe as high efficiency (with the logo of front load machines) BUT it was sent the one that is not high efficiency (blue lid), with one of the bottles broken and the box completely wet. TRULY DISAPPOINTING TRANSACTION, especially if I don't have time for making returns. I would recommend NOT BUYING any liquids from AMAZON (Last Time) ... take your time and buy at any Grocery Store and pay the delivery (at least you will know what will come home)."
1,Do waste your time on this product,The quality of this product is so poor that you can not open ANY watch case with it.You through your money away. And when you want to return it you have to pay for shipping.
5,Uncommonly delightful,"All 3 of Lichen's ""Uncommon Field Guide"" series are uncommonly delightful to poke into. One can read them chapter-by-chapter or just open the book anywhere and delve in. Even if it is an animal or plant you are familiar with, there is a good likelihood that you will discover something new about it in her description. Reading the books is somewhat like the joy of discovering an animal or plant for the first time or in an unexpected place. My only complaint is that there is not one of Feltner's detailed illustrations with every single chapter."
2,Chips Are US,The porcelain custard cups in question are marginal at best. One cup was chipped on arrival and another chip was discovered recently. Now the set is down to four. I would not purchase these again!DFD
4,Very Handy!,"These containers are just the right size for soooo many things. Of course, they work perfectly for small amounts of leftovers in the kitchen, but we also use them around the house as well. They are great for small parts, hardware, etc in the garage....and I love having them handy in my craft room for projects."
3,Good Easy Read,We read this book for our English class. It was a quick read. The book was retold by another author and not by Charles Dickens. Some of us liked the book because the chapters were short. We also liked the book was about Oliver's life. The book was easy to understand. We liked the characters in the story. There was a lot of rising action and the chapters ended with cliff hangers. The chapters had mysteries and clues throughout them.Part of our class was confused by the number of characters and multiple settings. It felt unorganized and all over the place. The events happened quickly. Parts of the story felt unrealistic. If you are looking for a book to read quickly in English this is a good book for you.
5,Not an unstructured work...,"I agree with all the other reviewers overwhelmingly positive comments about this set, but I just wanted to object to the pervasive opinion that the libretto is somewhat unstructured and only unified by the idea of the triumph of love: modern scholarship actually sees each of the four acts as reflecting the four main types of French baroque theatre prevalent in Rameau's day--i.e. sentimental melodrama (act 1), tragedy (act 2), comedy (act 3), and the idyllic pastoral (act 4).This is a wonderful opera on many levels, and while I have a few (minor) problems with the DVD that is available, I have none about this set. Another masterpiece from Christie."
2,can't take the heat,"I am a professional restoration contractor and like the concept but have gone thru 6 of these machines the last 5 years. Tube replacement is not the problem, the heat that builds up fries the electrical connectors. Connectng screws are tiny and all the internal connectors loosen easily and any resultant slight short causes complete connection failure. For that matter, all the machine's connectors loosen quickly under realworld use . I wish NASA contractors who are used to intensive heat and vibration and who are experts atceramic/connector technology would look at this wonderful idea and give us in the real world of contracting a reliable product. P.S.- I'VE NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE 5,000 HOURS ON THE BULBS TO SEE HOW GOOD THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THESE OTHER PREMATURE FAILURE ISSUES."
1,Poor research,"Aczel's account of Kabbalah is confused and full of serious mistakes. Anyone who is interested in Kabbalah's history and concepts should look elsewhere (namely, the works of Gershom Scholem, Joseph Dan, Isaiah Tishby, Moshe Idel, and Elliot Wolfson)."
5,This is one of the best dance CDs I have ever heard!,"This is just an amazing CD, jam-packed with great hits!! I love every song on it. Some of my favorites include Shorty (You Keep Playin' With My Mind) by Imajin, Get Ready To Bounce by Brookyln Bounce, and countless others. Although still fairly enjoyable, I didn't like the European CD as much. I thought it was a little too repetitive and there wasn't enough vocal envolvement. I was also amazed with the price of this cd! It was like buying 3 CDs for the cost of one. Anyone who likes ANY type of music would be happy with this purchase! This CD is constantly in my CD player and is one of the best CDs I have ever purchased."
2,Questionable Durability,"We purchased two to carry our kayaks over some mild terrain (sand). Over the course of one month, the tires would no longer hold air. The short stems made it extremely difficult to inflate these tires using a floor pump. We contacted the manufacturer only to be told that tires are wear items and would not be replaced under warranty. Other than this, this product would have been perfect for our needs."
3,kayak cart,"Kayak cart came timely with a fair price. The cart frame itself will not fit down into my kayak storage compartments but the wheels do and I fit the frame down onto the floor of my kayak. The cart instructions for securing to the kayak need some serious rewriting but I figured it out. With my own method of securing, the cart works great. I can even put two of our boats on the cart stacked and secured with straps. Good item."
4,Kayak dolly,Good product that absolutely makes my life easier! A little tough to pull thru the beach sand but other than that... it makes a two person job (carrying my two man kayak)a one person job. I saved $50 compared to other (more expensive) models.
1,DO NOT BUY this kayak carrier !,"This was a TOTAL waste of money -- the cables are installed on it wrong or in reverse, which makes it totally worthless -- We didn't even understand why it wouldn't work at first. Not going to pay more money to return it or re-engineer it ourselves, like the man above; just make sure we tell others and all here on the lake: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Does not function at all."
2,wimpy,I at least will be able to use this carrier to move one half of my 40 pound rowing shell. If you intend to approach the stated capacity of this carrier do so only on clean pavement. High clearence and light weight can be design flaws.
4,Works great!,"I recently bought a Adventure 14 Mad River canoe and needed a way to get it to the water other than carrying it. It weights 75lbs. This carrier works really well and makes the job much easier. Great storage capabilities also because it folds up neatly. It is made of aluminum (weather risistant) and is very sturdy. It takes a little practice getting it loaded, but once you learn, it's easy."
1,Worthless for kayaks,I bought this for my Malibu Stealth 12 Kayak and the first time I used it was disappointing. The thick wire strap that loops over it is a hindrance and doesn't allow the cart to open fully. I took it off because it kept collapsing because it was too narrow. It also is useless for any kayak that has a V shaped keel as a lot of them do. The crossbar's vee isn't deep enough for the pads to securely support the sides of the kayak. The V shaped hull of kayaks with a keel will not get the support needed - keeps tipping to one side while pulling no matter how tight the straps are. This may be better suited to a canoe with a short keel. Will now be getting the Scupper Pup which fits into the scupper holes for a very secure fit. Tried to save some cash but as the saying goes... You get what you pay for..
2,"measures for clinical practice: a sourcebook: volume 1: couples, families, and children, third edition (measures for clinical","the book is not worth much for me; I ordered it only because it was a required text by school I attend. Even the teacher did not want to use it. Not a good information source (searching google proves to much better!). You ended up making money, and that's the rest of the story!"
4,"Super Cute, but smelly!","We bought this crib in white from a BRU, and brought it home to assemble it. My husband did the entire assembly in about 30 min., so that was definitely a plus!THE SMELL!!! It has this super weird odor that simply permeated our entire house for weeks. Ultimately, we had to wash it down with soap and water, which helped a great deal. So, if you're almost due to bring your baby home, BEWARE of the overwhelming odor! However, the soap/water and a couple of Plug-Ins did the trick.We really like the classic simplicity of this crib. It definitely has a Pottery Barn-ish look to it for a fraction of the price. It's very sturdy, and will last through your child's teenage years! We really liked the stationary front (no drop-down bars to fiddle with), but both of us are fairly tall.Overall, we're quite pleased with our purchase."
4,Uh..,"Just bought the item, Looks to be really nice. Unlike the other idiot who posted a reveiw, I actually bought the item. No corn fields, not this. It's a display piece only. Unless you have some reapin' to do."
3,pleasant associations,"has not aged well, the kids at work picked on me about it. Brought back alot of memories, though. I recommend renting, if you can find it."
2,Thomas big loader,We purchased this and another one simular to this for christmas last year. Its a royal pain. It has to be set just right on the tracks if not...it will not run just comes off the track...and its not easy to get it to stay on there. Once it is on there...you can not touch it otherwise you will spend another 20 minutes trying to get it back on. My son was 3 and trying to tell him to just watch was useless. we packed up bolth and brought them to the good will store. It was such a hassle and way to many little pieces to put together. Stick with the wooden trains and tracks the kids love to scoot them around and put the tracks together...more hands on. This was a waist of my money.
1,"De-rails, breaks, and frustrates everyone","This toy took a looong time to put together. Then, we spent all evening snapping at our two children to not touch it because it kept breaking. The trains kept derailing and jamming. Cranky didn't work properly. We usually have fun as a family when we get new Thomas sets, but this one nearly caused World War III."
2,Thomas Loader is not for hand-on children,"My 3 year old son is a huge Thomas the Tank Engine fan - he has the train table and the wooden trains which he plays with constantly. He received the Big Big Loader as a gift. After we put it all together he was quite frustrated that it just goes by itself, he cannot interact with it. As another reviewer stated this is not a ""toy"" since they cannot ""play"" with it - they just sit there and watch it. Also, Lorry # 1 and Thomas do not stay on the track. They are constantly derailing when they come out of the turn about station. The toy claims it is easy for little hands to use but I beg to differ. My son cannot get them to stay on the track when he tries to do it himself, I can barely do it! So, bottom line is if your child likes to actually play with toys instead of sitting there staring at them, this product is not for them!"
3,Non-stop Fun,"Barbie Detective is one of the most fun Barbie cd rom games as it has so much to see,do and find.You can even interview suspects and play carnival games inbetween your search for poor Ken(who is locked away someplace)and the kidnapper who did it.Let me say that it is a perfect game for anyone with only 90 MHZ of play space on their computer-like me!!Its a good game!,but Barbie DOES get on your nerves as she walks into walls and repeats herself alot and says;""Oh i havent been in this room before,""a thousand times over,even though its the same room each time.Generally she acts very blonde so try to keep the swearing down to a minimum.Me and my mum have a little trouble with that.tata."
2,Yawn,"Personally, I felt this book to be redundant and a wordy tale of how to organize files. I tried to read it but kept dozing off. For me, I just want the writer to get to the point. Anyone well versed in Adobe products will already know most of this information. And let's face it, we all just want to be creative and take pictures. Do we really need to know every--little--minute--detail on how a RAW file is constructed?For me, I could stand to hear the short version of RAW Files 101. I agree, a little knowledge is great. Also, would like to know how Bridge can be used to process them. But honestly, I was really hoping it would detail the differences of Canon's ""Digital Photo Professional"" to Adobe's conversion plug in. Nothing.I'm disappointed..."
4,Very good primer for the new Raw features,"CS2 introduce a lot more functionality in camera Raw and this book I think was the 3rd book out on the subject after cs2 was released. The 2 main things this book will give you are1. How to use the new features in Camera Raw and Adobe bridge to do some work on your images before you pass them into photoshop, this includes cropping and curves.2. A good introduction to workflow- in fact if you have this book I don't think you need the other cs2 workflow book out there. This one is pretty through even including automation techniques.Overall I'm pretty happy with this book, I found some the information a bit useless for me, but someone else may find it invaluable. The whole metadata section and how to edit the xml file for example."
3,A few useful details on PS/RAW,"I read through this book in about 2 days - probably because the content was low and the fluff was high. The actual content was useful - Bruce Fraser does put together a useful procedure on the steps one should take in CS2 RAW: Exposure eying Histogram, Contrast, Shadows, Highlights, Noise and Sharpening. But the descriptions went from way to slow to way to fast. Also, it would be beneficial to follow along with the sample photos - not only to practice the techniques but also because it is impossible to see many of the changes in the poorly reproduced photos in the book! Third, summaries and checklists would have helped considerable when referencing in the future. I feel this book is good, but should have been made into a quick guide + sample photos = exercises."
4,Very nice book about new technics,"Think Bruce Fraser made good job with writing this book. I decided to read it only because my dad bought good photo camera and makes RAW-images.Very interesting and good book, but sometimes too much explanation some of them repeated too often. Would very much recommend to people who are new to Camera Raw, Raw pictures and DNG format. If you're photographer - it's book for you."
5,Great product,I received this in a very timely and fast manner. I have used the Zoo Med bulb for years. I will note that this particular bulb seems to be stronger and more luminous than the others in the past. This is a good thing. I usually purchase at the store where the bulbs probably sit for a couple years. I will continue to purchase these from the seller. I replace them every six or so months. Thank you!
2,"General web services, little on finance specifics","Given the specificity of the title I had expected to see financial web services standards covered, as well as regulatory impact of Sarbanes Oaxley and other measures. But there was little of that. What is there instead is a fairly high level walkthrough of web services standards that is reasonable well written.This book acts as a field guide of sorts, illuminating a path but not providing enough depth to serve as a guide for implementation. Illustrations were under-used and the small amounts of code that were provided weren't given much in the way of annotation."
4,Super Sports - Super Fun,"After we got this program properly loaded we really had a blast with it! The in-line skate side of the program goes a little slow and tedious for an unskilled user. The snowboard side, on the other hand, is useable from the beginning by small hands and large. The gear shops where you outfit the girls has a fun selection of clothes and equipment that match and vary in price. The gamer must skate or snowboard through the different levels to collect enough tickets to upgrade outfits and gear. Games are automatically saved by the sign-in name so you don't have to worry much about losing your hard-earned tickets. My nieces all thoroughly enjoyed this game - so did I! It's one program I'm glad we got. Always check the system requirements before you buy."
1,the sports,"The following reviw by Isabella (6 yr old)""it did not work. 5 diffrent levels of competition. snowboarding through obstacle courses and blad through radical race tracks. spectacular stunts, special tricks, and shcret areas. . . all kinda boring over and over again. forget it.""Parental comment: Some PC games are more stimulating and challenging that others. It appears this one dose not have much to offer in either catagory. No she didn't care for it at all."
1,teen story...again,I was disappointed with this story. The real romance was between Lady Miranda and Dandy Dan. That story/romance had sparks and was interesting. Dessi and Dax? Pure teen romance.
4,"Good product, but limited drivers.","Careful, the cd-rom that came with the kit I recieved only included drivers for the the LG VX8500 Chocolate. Luckily I have one, but, I'm out of luck when it comes to my LG enV. That doesn't make the kit a bad value, but without drivers for your phone the usb adapter is useless. So if you are getting this and you don't own an LG Chocolate, be sure you already have or can get the correct driver for your phone. Don't assume you can find them online, Verizon has done their best to make sure that those are very hard to get unless you buy their kit."
2,VX 8700??,The car charger works OK but the advertising said it was also for the VX 8700. The CD contains no reference or drivers for the 8700.
1,This Game is Crap,"This is the most dumbist game I ever played. So if you like horses and The Saddle CLub you should get that game insted. The reson I hate this game is becouse you can't take care of your horse or clean out its stall and you can't solve a mystery, and it is very easy!"
3,"great watch, cheap strap","the watch is great, it's very cute and shiny. although the strap is not made of leather, it's velvet, and some of the parts are already chipping off. i'm planning on having the strap changed into a leather one."
1,Want KINDLE version in US!!!!!!,Please get the Kindle version in the USA. Really surprised this is only available in the UK. That does not make sense to me. I would even be happy with a PDF copy.
5,Deadly Embrace,"Enjoyable book, received book quickly after ordering. Book in excellent condition.Had been unable to find book in local bookstores"
1,Snooty and snide.,"Looking to rent a movie to watch with the kids? Well, this book will fill you in on such crucial information as production company, writer, and photographer, but won't give you a clue as to plot, sexual content or violence. It rates a large percentage of decent movies with zero stars (out of four), leaving you to guess if they're worthwhile. (Meanwhile, apparently every film out of France is a can't-miss.) The supercilious tone throughout is irritating. Sample tidbits: the jazz-related ""'Round Midnight"" appeals only to ""minorities"" (what is THAT supposed to mean?!) and let's see, ""Wizard of Oz"" rates 3 stars. This book is for cinema snobs only...average filmgoers will find it less than useless."
5,hanger happy,These hangers are great for my big and tall hubby's clothes. They are sturdy and really nice for his shirts.
2,too generic,"I had to check to see when this was written, because it is so devoid of current technology, it could easily have been written in the 60s or 70s. The villain, Dr. Goslar, is one of those all-powerful shadowy figures usually seen in pulp fiction (e.g., Fu Manchu). If he is so powerful and such a threat with some new biological weapon, why are there only a few agents attempting to bring him down? And why does Goslar fail again and again to kill them? There is also a plot twist involving sisters which I saw coming at least three hundred pages early. Weak, especailly when stacked up against say, Frederick Forsyth or Andy McNab."
4,Not too bad!,The finish was as good as I hoped for. Not too happy with the mounting bracket/spring. Have used this style holder in the past with a better mounting bracket. Was happy with the quick response & delivery.
1,"Nice book, if you can order it???!!!","I ordered it. But after a week i got an vague e-mail reply from Amazone that the book couldn't be shipped because they couldn't purchase it from anyone.On the Amazon website it still can be ordered, strange.... Not even an update of the page with an ""out of stock"" message.Maybe it has something to do with the upcoming ""Worlds of Warcraft""-special edition. The game and The art book.Nice going, Publisher. I just want the book, not the game. How much fun it may be...."
2,THEY FORGOT ABOUT COUNTRY!!,i haven't even read the book but i looked at the index and felt the need to write this review. they have missed a whole genre of music. they should call this book the greatest rock/pop albums of all time. i'm sure its a great book but the title is not specific enough.
4,Very Advanced,"I imagine this book would be a useful reference for advanced students of Japanese, professional translators, and those deeply interested in linguistics. However, the book's academic style and intricately detailed discussions are not useful to me, an intermediate student of Japanese with only a passing interest in linguistics,"
2,What's with the handle. Major storage problem,"I don't know what for or how other people would be using this tool, but I don't see it fitting comfortably in anyone's hand. Not an adult's nor a child's. I have other OXO Good Grips items that I am pleased with because they increase the utility of the product or are multi-functional.The handle is much larger than my medium sized hammer handle. It is so over kill for my uses. I would only be scraping the last bit of cake batter or frosting out of a bowl; a dainty two- or three- finger exercise at most. This tool requires five fingers, a hand, a wrist, and a forearm, wow. The white rubber portion is average sized and looks puny by comparison.And where do you store it! To fit in my utensil drawer I would have to evict 4 or 5 of the current tenants. I wish I hadn't thrown out my old dirty looking scrapper, it did its job well, but had lost its eye appeal."
1,False Advertising,"Attention Sum 41 fans: If you're buying this cd, much like I did, thinking that you're getting new music, think again. There is no original sum 41 music on this cd at all as it is simply a biography. Don't be fooled! It's not worth it."
2,Shipping Charges,"The Product is very good ,however what is mentioned as the delivery cost is just the US portion .if you buy from other countries be careful since for Canada I had to pay 37 $CAD more for delivery in Canada."
1,RPS A35 HUMIDIFIER WATER PAD,"AFTER PAYING FREIGHT, I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS SAME PRODUCT AT HOME DEPOT FOR THE SAME PRICE. ALSO IT WASN'T PACKED VERY WELL. SO ONE CORNER OF THE PAD WAS DAMAGED."
3,Price is better if gotten locally!,I found this at local home improvement stores (4lb box Dap brand 8.5% TSP whereas this is 6.5%) for $11.
3,OK,"I'm not really sure how to review this item. I'll do the cons first: It's definitely dated. The production qualities are not the best, and although it says it's geared to younger would-be drummers, I think 7+ would actually be more accurate. My 5 y/o was so excited about getting this DVD to use with his drum kit, but never made it past the first 15 minutes. I think an older child (like 9+) might find it too corny to the point of babyishness, but maybe not.The plus side isn't really a plus--it seems to be the only one out there. Hopefully your little drummer will find it more engaging than mine did because the material they present is sound."
4,"Very, very good, but not perfect.","This is the best version actually of Giulio Cesare, but it isn't perfect. Really great are Jennifer Larmore (Cesare) and Bernarda Fink (Cornelia). Derek Lee Rangin is a good Ptyolomeo, Furio Zanassi a very good Achilla, Dominique Visse a luxe as Nireno, and the Concerto Kioln sound is really perfect, with a really inspired René Jacobs.Where are the problems? The very big problem is Marianne Rolhom, a really horrible Sextus (no coment, only listen to Della Jones with Mackerras or Anne Sophie Von Otter with Minkowski singing it and make a comparisson...). Another little problem is Barbara Schlik as Cleopatra: Her role is very difficult, ok, but... She doesn't sing bad, but her coloraturas aren't beautiful, and her high notes are of metal.There isn't any better recording of Giulio Cesare (I don't heard to new Minkowski's version). Buy this, it's a very good option."
3,Oh well...,"I bought this because I love Rene Jacobs. As expected, conducting is superb! Rene Jacobs can conjure a great performance out of any cast, but unfortunately - not this time. Overall cast I dissent (to many squeaky sopranos, if you ask me), but what happened to Sextus! The heroic and passionate Sextus! Not even Rene Jacobs could pull Sextus out of Marianne Rorholm. It sound like the role is just out of her vocal and emotional range. She killed Sextus!Please, record Vicica Genaux in this role!I'd recommend Julius Caesar with Ferdinand Leitner, Fritz Wunderlich, Hans Bruno Ernst. It is in German and sound a little weird, but in my humble opinion the cast is much more suitable."
4,What the Doc Ordered: Hard Rocking Aussie Angels!,"One of the best ever Australian hard rocking bands from the late 70's and throughout the 80's deliver this great collection of good time rocking tunes.Why the Angels never reached ACDC status in the states is beyond me, they had the songs, the front man with attitude and one hell of a live show.So here they are, 20 of their best songs. Pick this up and roll with the good times."
1,Not worth it--Girls deserve better.,"This game is dull, tedious and altogether boring. Girls software? Somebody can do better. A lot better. Unlike any good title worth its salt with multiple levels and the ability to keep a game going for hours and hours, this one is over the first time (if you have the patience to stick with it that long) and them I don't know who in their right mind would want to play it again. Two thumbs down."
1,Don't waste your time,"The premise of a quartet of average, working-class women going after some con men to get their money back could theoretically produce an interesting film, but this sure ain't it. Overlong, boring, predictable, little character development, and despite a lot of running around crashing cars and hitting people, not much really happens. Pretty thin stuff."
5,It was great told what really happened.,The thrre tape summary of The tet offensive the fall of sigon the best battels in vietnam. It is tald the real way and not just a goverment cover up
2,Samsung sync cord,"The price is good and the product works but if you don't have and in-depth techinical base, it is very difficult to unstall the software. An CD comes with the cord, but all it does is tell you where online to search for the installation software.I couldn't do it myself and it took a frend of mine who works for Direct TV about 45 minutes to get it to work. If Samsung would send a CD that would actually install the software, it would be the perfect little cord. But unfortunately, that's not the case."
3,"Data, but no charge","This is a DATA ONLY cable; it does not charge the phone. I really wanted a cable that I could use the charge the phone on my laptop when traveling.This cable does work fine as a DATA cable to transfer music, make ringtones, or even use the phone as a modem on your laptop."
3,Quick but thorough introduction to Yellowstone's geysers,"Published in 1947, this book contains a very good explanation of what causes Yellowstone's geysers to erupt although some more recent scientific knowledge of the interrelation of neighboring geysers and their interconnections is not present.The book is liberally illustrated with a black-and-white photo of one of the hundreds of geysers on every other page.One of the really unique features of this book is a comprehensive list of all the geysers that were active at the time of the book's publishing. This list gives a brief description of each geyser including the average time between eruptions and the length of play it has.Despite the age of the book, the writing does not have the arcance or stilted writing style that some older books seem to exhibit."
5,The Epitome of An Apologitics Resource Tool,"This encyclopedia is probably the greatest apologetic resources available. The strength of this masterpiece is that Norman Geisler (A Conservative Christian philosopher and scholar) demonstrates impartiality towards fellow Christians and atheist alike. He shows the weaknesses and strenths from both theists and atheists. For example, he points out some of the philisophical flaws of Francis Schaffer's views (a fellow Christian who was extremely popular in the field of apologetics). This is just one example of Geilser's willingness to pursue truth over popularity in the apologetic field. A must resource for all Christians!"
3,Book good pratice test is junk,After taking the test I of course failed. To make matters worse I missed it by 1 question. The pratice resources that come with the book [disappoint]. If you try to use any of the test etc you will not learn the first thing. The book is a good resource for learing but the test [was disappointing] beyond reality
3,You get what you pay for,"The pan is okay, but the cover doesn't stay on well. The cover is curved, so it doesn't store stacked up in the cupboard as well as a flat metal one does. I'd pay more for a covered cake pan next time."
1,Not Much of a Diuretic,I had read in several places of Dandelion leaf's use as a diuretic and was eager to try it out. Freeze-dried seemed to be the best way to get the most potent product and thus best results.Not sure which is bogus but both the claim and the product failed in this attempt.
4,Used for over 2 years,I've used this lens as one of my 2 main lenses for over 2 years - great image quality and quick AF. Only drawback is it's not an f2.8 lens.
4,Good Basic Lens,Light weight construction and could be better with a 300mm zoom but for the price is a good quality lens. Pictures come out clear and focus is quick.
5,Quality Lens,"I purchased this lens to go with my Pentax K-5 and have been very pleased with the results thus far. As someone who does outdoor portrait photography, this lens is invaluable. I'm pleased with the speed of focus and image quality. Very good purchase for any Pentax users."
4,Amazing quality for the price,"Having just entered the modern era of digital SLR's I'm completely pleased with the quality, convenience and design of this lens. I had taken some air show and portrait shots but I felt the real test came at the inaugural IRL road course race at Infineon Raceway this summer. The lens behaved without flaw both in and out of the sun as I panned through turns three, four and five. A must have for any *ist owner."
4,LIght and Simple,"This is a nice lens for the money especially if you need is smaller and lighter as a priority. Backpacking, wildlife on the run, sports, anywhere that you might carry the camera for a long time, you will like the weight and flexibility of the lens. We use it on a K10d an produce some great results.Only issue is that you may develop some edge distortion depending on the focal range and setting, and at 52mm it does suffer a bit in low light conditions. Overall - it works for great for the price!"
4,Great Value for the Money!,"This lens is a great value for the money. I use this lens for shooting action shots at sporting events and have found it to be a perfect fit, the quality of the pictures are good and I am able to capture good action without having to be too close."
5,Unbeatable at this price,"This is a great zoom. The pictures come out sharp. This lens gets plenty of light with my K200D, despite not being rated ""fast"".This is a good complement to the 18-55 kit lens of the Pentax K200D.You cannot do better for a new lens at this price."
1,Blasephemous,The book slurs and blasephems the divine name of G/D. I found it offensive and a waste of money and paper.
3,Non-denatured wheys,"Non-denatured whey is most difficult to mix. Start with 1Tbsp of water, add package and stir to make a paste. let sit for 3-5 minutes then add to your favorite beverage or water, it is best to take on empty stomach. take 2x daily. I find mixing with PLAIN yogurt works best for me. I received this item which expires in 3 months, normally this has a 18 month shelf life, so this has been sitting around who knows where... I would have liked to have a fresher product delivered. Immunocal is the original product, but this should be the same, however Immunocal is TWICE as much and sold by Multi-level marketing.... 3 stars for the old shelf life, otherwise a fine product."
1,Fell off,Fell off after the first day...Would not buy againLooked good-found them lying on the ground the next morningNot worth the money
5,A fine dark romance,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends LAST THINGS FIRST THINGS as a strange, exciting, frustrating & sometimes, hilarious tale of two people who must ask the most basic questions of life.Why me?If not now, when?What should I do?Wells Earl Draughon has written a fine dark romance in which everyone is very normal, coping with everyday frustrations & setbacks, who find, by thinking things through & surviving their darkest hours, that living now to the fullest, is all there is."
3,"this book is good 4 entertainment, but i dont believe it","As someone with a 135+ I.Q i cant say that i believe any of this to be true.But it is a good book 4 entertainment.But as far i as i know the smartest child in the world is michael kearny ,who attendended college at the age of 6 and graduated at the age of 10.At the age of 4 his I.Q was registerd at 325.His parents wrote a book called ACCIDENTAL GENIUS about their son, michael,who is now 15 yrs.old,as of 1/18/99."
2,"Fairly thorough, but outdated","I purchased this book during the start-up phase of becoming a new mortgage broker. Being new to the industry, I was looking for a comprehensive treatment of the subject. While this book did a fair job of covering the subject, it does show it's age. There have been vast changes in this industry over the 12 years since it's publication. There is no coverage of automated underwriting or LOS software - both of which are critical to success in the industry today.So while you will get a broad introduction to the profession from this book, it will certainly not give you everything you need to know to become a successful mortgage broker. There are better publications out there, but unfortunately they are hard to find."
2,I have to agree with the others. Don't bother.,"Most of the things told in the guide is easily found on other free sites. Also, you don't need this to easily figure out where to go and what to do in the game next.If you play online, as I do, it is crazy to consider purchasing. BattleNet is constantly adding patches to the game to keep the hackers as honest as possible. Most patches occur within the first 2 months of the game's release date. (Which is NOW!) Many things will change or become outdated very quickly.Wait. There will probably be a second guide release with the new updates. If now, no matter. You REALLY don't need it!"
3,Good Book,"This book was really good, I like the creativity of the book. In a world of magic and fairy tales, this book brought something new to the table. The book was set in real time, so you didn't have a unique world to involve yourself in. The book was no harry potter, so I give it a 3 stars, only because the book didn't have any imagination. It didn't give you a sense of being somewhere else. It didn't even describe the settings too well. It was sort of rushed and choppy. But a good read nonetheless."
4,Almost wonderful,"The adventures of the ""Children of the Lamp"" is a very entertaining and captivating book. I must admit I had trouble putting the book down once it got going. However, I was a little taken aback by the ""advertising"" in the first few chapters wherein he used name brands a bit too much. Berluti shoes? Fox Kids? The Disney Channel? CNN? Jimmy Choos? (To name but a few). I get the feeling the author is writing to a very ""hip"" and financially secure generation. Either that or he is getting some sort of kickback from the entities he names. And Arthur Miller's play, ""The Crucible""? I don't know a lot of adults who either know of it or have seen it. Either children of today are very enlightened on fashion and the arts, or the author is directing the story to an older age group. Perhaps my own world is smaller than it seems?That being said, the storyline is quite good and I do look forward to the next installment of ""Children of the Lamp"". I just hope he leaves out all the advertisements."
3,Guide by experienced writer,"Ten routes are clearly described in each of the following seven regions: Hautes-des-Vosges, the Ardennes, the Foret d'orient and paysd'Othe, the Ile-de-France, the paysde caux, Suisses Normande, and the Foret des Andaines Brtiiany. There are maps and illustrations. The book is a total 191 pages. Martin is an experienced writer of books for walkers and has also written European books on walking in the French Alps, Dolomites of Italy and Mont Blanc. Paths get overgrown in 20 years. So for a more up to date but wider ranging guide on French walking try the very good ""Walking in France"" by Gillian Souter."
5,The Best on DVD!,"I just bought the what's Happening collection, and I can't wait for the second complete season to come out, I've watched and laughed so hard they brought back alot of memories, I got a chance to meet with the late great Fred Berry in my home State of Maryland where I had found out that Fred Berry himself had bought a home here in the Prince George's county of Maryland, I talk with him and had him do the dance for me, just like watching him on television again...he gave me a kiss and an autograph...he is truely missed by his friends here Prince Georges county Maryland."
1,No Tracking Info,upset because this company does not give tracking info about the purchased product. I feel that if you have my payment I should be able to track my package. I will never purchase anything else.
3,visually outstanding; function so-so,"Visually the satin sheets are outstanding. Stunning is an applicable word. But when it comes to use-function... the inherent ""slickness"" is problematic and annoying. They slip and slide all over the place (fitted bottom sheet is fine since it is ""locked onto"" the mattress). But the loose top sheet is the problem-child... only in place when the bed is first made, never in place during or after a night's sleep, becomes worse each succeeding night if the sheets aren't completely realigned and positioned from scratch.Would I buy them again? Despite the apparent quality and sensory feel, no I wouldn't. Great to impress guests... or the mistress... but not for daily use."
3,"He's right, Twilight Zone it is.","I am going to search around for the level to which the 1950s were Twilight Zone domain. This could well have been a TZ script. Very nicely done, very much a ""lifting the veil of perception"" type of book."
5,Good,I don't know much about hackey sacks but my brother saw it and said that it was of very good quality.
5,Great Guide,"This book answered all the questions I had about building an electric guitar. It lays out all the basic measurements you need including Scale Lengths, Neck and Head sizes, nut and bridge sizes, etc. And it tells you what you need to know to modify each of these to make the guitar your own. If you have no idea how to work with tools and wood you should start with a Wood Working book, But if you have basic knowledge of wood working this book will tell you every thing you need to know to use that knowledge to build your very own and hopefully Original Guitar."
3,Strictly for beginners . . . too much extraneous info for pros,"The title of the book is, ""Make Your Own Electric Guitar,"" But it reads like Guitar 101. If you are a guitar technician or wood craftsman and have experience with or a working knowledge of guitars, their history and electronics you'll find huge sections of this book almost useless: while the book indeed has useful information it is buried in extraneous asides, folksy wit, excessive description, opinion and historical information that has little or nothing to do with the actual building process. The one thing I'm certain is that, while a very talented craftsman, the author loves to take advantage of a captive audience. If you want to get right to the building process without the history lessons - I suggest the Waring, Raymond book, ""Make Your Own Electric Guitar & Bass"" - it's about 1/2 the size and gets right to the the tools and process of building solid body guitars and basses."
1,"Works fine, smells HORRIBLE!","I had previously purchased several square panels from Auralex, with the triangular ridges. They worked great, but I wanted something that would cover more surface area. These larger panels certainly do that, but they also emit an almost unbearable odor. It's like a combination of plastic-y chemicals and dog urine, if you can imagine that. It's just horrible. And I've had these panels up in my music room for about 2 weeks, and it's still overpowering. I'm literally going to take them all down this weekend and just throw them away, after spending around 120$ on them. Very frustrating.How other reviewers were not bothered by this is utterly beyond me."
1,Acoustic Foam does not smell so good,"The smell of this foam is so horrible as to render it unusable. If it did not have such and awful smell then I'm sure it would work as intended, but the smell is so bad that I can't stand to be around it. I even tried using extra strength Febreze on it but to no avail. I'd suggest looking for some other acoustic foam that has no bad smell."
1,Trivia should be correct,"I was so disappointed with this book. It might be gossipy but has all the accuracy of gossip.You know there have been so many more high-profile fakes sold to the breathless press and public as authentic - just think of the Hitler diaries which were reprinted. It is much easier to pull a swifty on the public and reviewers when the subject is more obscure.The information Murray used is easily available in the public sphere. Christopher Hibbert has done a great job editing Gronow's works, it is easily available too, Lesley Blanch did a wonderful job on both Julia Jones and Harriette Wilson's memoirs. There are endless copies of the Creevey papers too.All these books are marvellously gossipy, have great detail- they also have editors that understand their subjects and are able to shed light on their lives which Murray is incapable of doing."
2,failed to hold my interest,"This book looked interesting when I picked it up, and I'd heard from other readers that it was good. I've never read much about this period, so I was interested to find out what it was like.I found it mildly entertaing in parts, but in a way repetitve. The book is divided into sections, each dealing with a different aspect of society such as the 'bon ton', london, the seaside, the persuit of pleasure, fashion and manners.In the end I found that most of the people she was writing about were very self indulgent and mostly came to a bad end. (like any regency novel). I've also since found out that this book is not the best on accuracy which is a dissapointment.In the end I found I was skim reading this book, because I felt like I was going over the same ground over and over, and it just lost my interest. Some books will do that to you and this one did it to me. Such a shame as I started with high hopes for it."
5,Best introductory text to the New Testament,"This book is quite thorough and succinct. The references at the end of each chapter are extremely useful. Footnotes, though quite extensive, are of immense help. I suspect our fundamentalist friends will not share my views. But I do believe this is destined to become a classic."
1,Not Worth the Trouble,"A number of buyers commented that the pitchers were broken upon arrival but I purchased them anyway, hoping that the company had cured the problem. The box containing the pitchers was shrink-wrapped in a VERY thin layer of bubble wrap, the kind with the tiny, rather flat bubbles. Then the smaller box was packed in a much larger box without bubble wrap to fill up the large gaps between the small and large boxes. So the pitchers just rattled around inside during shipping until one finally shattered. What a waste.I tested the surviving pitcher for dribbling and can confirm that it DID leak from the lid when pouring. The lids are cheap and flimsy and probably would not hold up over time. On a more positive note, the pitcher itself is nice and heavy and easily fits in the fridge door.Overall, I would avoid this product unless and until the lids are re-engineered and the packaging problems are fixed. Mine are being returned."
2,lousy lids!,"Love the idea of glass pitcher with a lid so bought these.All is good except when you go to pour liquid into a glass. You will be better served to leave off the pouring lid (with 2 sides; one for allowing ice to flow out with the liquid, and the other side has strainer slots). With the lid on, when you pour, the liquid pours out beyond the lid area and you get liquid all over your counter/table.Very pooly designed lids!"
4,Simple and useful,"These glass pitchers are nice. They look and feel like a heavier sturdy glass. The lids are nice to keep the liquids inside the pitchers fresh, but that's all they do. They're not rubber sealed so the liquids can spill out. The spout on the pitcher isn't the greatest either. It dribbles down the side after pouring and you'll have to wipe the pitcher down. I started juicing and bought these pitchers to put the fresh squeezed juices in, so far they're working fine for this purpose. They fit easily into the fridge and even on the side of the door."
2,Poor for Pouring,"These are lovely and fit well into the side door of a fridge. BUT, they are lousy at pouring. Although they are clearly intended to be vessels for pouring liquid, the liquid leaks big time. What a mess. I'm stuck with them, so I do continue to use. A way to get around the leaking is to remove the cap when pouring. But that defeats the purpose of having a pourable pitcher."
1,Too prone to breaking,"One of the two pitchers in this set was chipped when I received it, so I threw it away. The set was about the price of a single comparable pitcher, so this didn't both me much.After using the remaining pitcher a half-dozen times for iced tea, it shattered. It was room temperature and had no cracks or chips. I poured hot water into the pitcher, and as soon as it was full, one side of the pitcher completely cracked and shot across my kitchen, getting boiling water and glass shards everywhere.I've used glass pitchers for iced tea for years and never had this happen before. These pitchers are not as durable as they seem."
3,Adequate,"My first set arrived broken into bits and was returned. Amazon was great about the return! The second set arrived just fine. They are pretty and heavy. My only complaint is that I can not get it to pour without leaking if the lid is on. Once I remove the lid, it is fine. Be aware that they are very heavy for the size because of the thick glass. If you like that, it is wonderful, but for some people it may be too heavy."
2,Cap leaks,"Great glass bottle. Fits easily in my tightly packed frig. Cap, however, causes dribble. For a good pour, you need to remove the cap."
5,Great plug.,These are OEM plugs for my 2005 Acura RL. I replaced them at 92K miles just because I thought it was time to do it. When I pulled the used plugs they looked like they could have gone another 50K miles on the car without any problems. They came from the factory with the perfect gap and it is not necessary to adjust them. The perfect plug and worth the money in my opinion.
4,shadow at the bottom of the picture due to the lens size,"I bought this lens for my Sony DSC-H20 camera which did not provided a very wide view are. These lens make a big difference. Now I can cover a larger area. My camera looks nice with this wide angle lens. I can take nice and colorful panoramic pictures. The only thing I do not like about these lens is that you can't use the flash with the lens mounted. The lens create a shadow at the bottom of the picture. Sony did not think on that problem or maybe they did, but they leave it like that in order to the costumer has to buy an external flash. However, I do not think I would be using the flash too much and if I have to I will just unlock the adapter and take out the lens."
2,not good,"I have a DSC-H1. I've tested this lens extensively. It adds more than a 33% to your field of view, but that added stuff is warped and blurry. I am unable to get a shot that is clear enough to be proud of. It exaggerates the H1's natural tendency for purple fringes. I used a tripod and took two pictures of the same scene, both on timer. This is an actual image (black rectangle) set inside one taken with the adapter on. Notice how warped and color-distorted edges are.[...]I would say save your money, but I use this lens occasionally.[...]"
3,Works well if you do not use a Flash!,You simply cannot use a flash with this lens!Even using the Sony HVLFSL1B External Slave Flash you still get a shadow at the bottom of the screen - the slave flash helps but you still get the shadow.Otherwise I am very happy with the lens. It mounts just fine - remember to set the software setting before using it though
4,"Stunning music, good performance","It is hard to believe that these madrigals were the young Schutz' graduation thesis under Gabrieli in Venice. The quality of the music is nothing short of D'India, Gesualdo or Monteverdi. In fact the book is strongly reminiscent of the latter's Books IV and V. As you'd expect from Concerto Vocale the performance is equally flawless. Only one small bug - madrigal no.19, the closing eight voice dedication to Schutz' sponsor, is missing. There used to be a recording available by Anthony Rooley and the Consort of Musicke which included no.19, but it seems to have dropped out of the DHM catalogue. In the meantime noone is going to go far wrong with a mid-price reissue of Jacob's version. (Assuming, we hope, that Harmonia Mundi have remembered to include the texts and translation even at mid-price...)"
2,Bad Choice,"Katy Green an accomplished violinist and sax player joins the Ultra Belles, an all girl swing band touring California in 1940, and they start dropping dead around her. The multi voice audio play narration comes across more like a soap opera. The retro to 1940 is interesting, and I enjoyed Manny the Brit talent agent who can spin a story with the best of them. But the lame whodunit murders and too little music for a musical killed my interest.It gets worse! Wait 'til you find out who the murder is. Better yet, don't bother. Take a pass on this one."
5,Please read the instructions!,"This is a rebuttal to Jessie's review. She asserts that the water heater doesn't accurately heat the water to her desired temperature. What she doesn't know is that the water heater always boils the water first to drive out the chlorine, then the temperature drifts down to it's preset limit where it is kept warm. What Jessie needs to do is to fill the unit before bed, set the timer and when she wakes up she will be rewarded with water at her desired temperature. It will keep the water at that temperature until she fills it again, then it will boil the water again, and let it drift down to her pre-set temperature.This is a terrific little unit: efficient, accurate, and a joy to those who read their instructions."
1,bad electric plug,"For an expensive and seemingly well built appliance, the Electric Plug that inserts into the unit is a joke. It easily falls out of the unit and in a busy kitchen, the least little bump disconnects the power. Think twice before shelling out this much money!!!"
1,Rusty spots in the bottom.,I found rusty spots in the bottom.every rusty spots have a very tiny whole in the center.I don't want to use it anymore.
4,very well written,"Arabella is justifiably surprised when she is woken up one night to find that her father has gambled her away to the dark sinister viscount Blackwater. However, she accepts his hand in marriage in order to escape life as a spinster with her intolerable family. Both Blackwater and Arabella remind themselves that theirs is a marriage of convenience. However, they find themselves falling in love, aided and deterred by various cyprians and manservants. The story was surprisingly well written and Arabella was very likable. I was only slightly disappointed to see that their was not much of a physical relationship between the two. There was only one kiss at the end. I do not like the overtly trashy romance novels that substitue good writing with sex scenes. This novel could have used a little more though."
3,Not Bad,"book is okay, makes some hasty judgements and then lags a little toward the end, but still pretty good."
1,Required reading for pinheads,"No doubt the Bush bashers will enjoy this drivel by Phillips. If you are looking for a reason to rationalize your current inequalities, whatever they may be and want to blame Bush, then this book is right for you.If, on the other hand, you are intelligent, you know your history, you know that Bush I and Ronald Reagan fixed the mistakes of Jimmy Carter and Bush II fixed the mistakes of Slick Willy aka Mr. Zipper, then you will see this trash for what it really is.I do agree with Phillips that the Bush's have a Dynasty going. And that Dynasty has created a better America and a safer world.Thank God for the Bush's. Thank God for GWBBII and thank God for our great military.Only people who never read the financial pages and are not aware of what is really going on will support this book. Kevin Phillips comes across as a very bitter man."
2,Too Long,"Some interesting information here, but this book is about 10 times more complicated than it needs to be. The excess amount of background information tends to make the book very confusing. You get the impression the author was getting paid by the word."
4,Royalty is Un-American!,"A documented indictment of the Bush/Walker clan, with longstanding ties to historically dubious characters, including Nazi German leadership and the oil-drenched bin Ladens of Saudi Arabia. Phillips leaves no stone unturned. A must read to caution us against the perils of dynastic rule."
4,"Nothing New, but Well Presented","[...] Kevin Phillips was very much a conservative by 1970's standards, but by holding his ground now appears practically progressive. As he noted in his CNN presentation, all the material in this book has been readily available for some time, requiring at most a trip to public records and often nothing more than a Google search. His presentation of this material is solid, not spectacular, but what makes this book seem so bold or even outrageous is that none of the questions he raises has ever been dealt with by the major national media.This is the real question that he wonders outloud about while pushing his book. Right or wrong, fire or smoke and mirrors, why does the liberal news media go out of its way not to address the very issues that Ike begged us to be vigilant about? There is nothing more precious than our nation's democracy based freedom, and it is better to err on the side of impolite questioning than blind faith."
5,Perfect String Winder,"This was my first time stringing my own guitar, and the Planet Waves string winder/cutter worked exactly as I was hoping!"
2,"As a string winder, OK. As a pin remover not so good","Header says it all. Works well enough as a string winder, but I was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me, this did not work well at all. Went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle."
5,So useful,"I've had string winders for years, but never a multifunction one like this. I recently bought it for my niece, and taught her how to change her strings.The different size gaps make it 'grab' the tuning pegs much better than my old one. I was able to use it on an electric, steel string acoustic, and classical, and it grabbed them all rather well. The string cutter works well, and the peg puller does also. So handy!"
4,Excellent product,I bought this product to replace the many tools needed to string my guitars. This has everything needed to change your strings on all guitars. The reason i gave it 4 stars is because of the material it is made of. It doesn't feel very sturdy. All aspects of this tool work perfectly as designed. Excellent product.
4,Very solid,"Really simple to use. Used this to do my first re-string and it was straight forward and really easy to use. I am not a professional musician, so heavy use, i'm not sure, but for my purpose, it works great!"
2,"OK, but!","Not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder. Thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but, not quiet up to par. You'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips."
4,Handy Little Gadget...,"It beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet, but it could be better.1. It slips off if you go too fast, but I thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this.2. It didn't come with much of any instructions, so I was using it wrong at first. There is a big and a small slot.3. The cutter is so that I pinched my finger during use. The cutter works great, you just have to be careful.4. The screw that holds it on keeps coming loose. Sure I can tighten it, but it just means the design could be better.All and all it's one of those must have gadgets, but it does require a little discipline to master. I hope the next version comes with a soft, rubber insert so it doesn't scratch the chrome off my turner pegs. That and maybe they could use a long screw and some Loctite to keep it from coming loose. And well, maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find. Everything I have seems to be jet black."
3,Not worth the price they're selling it for,"This book has very good pictures and detailed instructions, but is basically something you could put together at any copy store. It has the plastic ringed connector, and looks like a paperback manual someone copied for me. It definitely isn't worth the new price of $39.95 and still not worth the used price of $20-25. It's more useful for an actual trailer than a manufactured home and leaves out a lot of the more realistic details for upgrade that someone might want to do to make this look less like a trailer inside."
3,Size of toy,First let me say I did not read the size of this toy as I should have. She is BIG!! About 5x the size of the little figures I collect. The picture was the same and I believed she was the same size. I was very surprised when I opened the box. I will just let her sit on my shelf.
5,Lifelike,My grandson loves this toy. We looked up info about alligators and watched a few shows on reptiles after getting the toy.
4,Good book,I really liked this one. A nice easy book on introing Paganism into your homeschooling life. Good ideas. I really like the chapter on Teaching the elements and also the chapter on teaching with festivals.Heather mama of 5
2,NOT LIKE THE MOVIE CASINO,"I am a big fan of the original movie Casino, which was based on a true story. I like it so much that I have viewed it at leased 10 times.I could only stand viewing this movie once.I give this movie, The Real Casino two stars.I would not recommend this movie."
5,Very Useful,This book is an inspiration. I just love making these Waldorf dolls and the instructions in this book are very simple and easy to follow.
5,A Book for all women of the 21st century,"Power Tools for Women is one of those books you want all your friends and collegues to read, only you can not bear to lend your copy!. This book is a must for all women. We are in a position of transition, trying to balance home life and career, being wives, mothers, bosses, role models, and somewhere in there trying to maintain our sense of self. Joni Daniels has captured our issues and given us a wonderful resouce on how to work with them. Her wit and writing style coupled with her examples of real people situations make it such an easy read.I am buying this book as gifts for all the women in my life,and I know they will love me for it!!"
2,Check out the seller before you order!,"BEWARE, there is an issue with this listing 'cause not all of the sellers are offering the Genuine APC OEM battery packs -- some are manufacture their own and you can find various listings on Amazon that will show you the battery they sell but listed as a RBC6 Equivalent Replacement Battery Cartridge.As far as the battery I received, it seems fine. Same size, fits just fine in my SmartUPS 1000 and the folks are personable and more than willing to stand behind their products! Shipping is quick, price is right and all... it's just NOT as Amazon has it listed here... it's NOT ASIN: B00004Z8BC as the listing states! This is misleading and I've submitted a correction to the Amazon site - we'll see how this pans out. The seller says it's Amazon who has mislisted the item and have asked Amazon to correct it. Also, I'm stuck disposing of my old APC battery since there is no PrePaid return shipping label I'm used to receiving from APC purchases :-("
4,Coffee filter,"This works really good. It works really well. Of course, the coffee is drip, so it's not as good as French press, but it does all it is supposed to do."
2,Only if you're a real 'Sock Puppet' fanatic,"The Pets.com TV advertising campaign was hilarious. The commercials with the Sock Puppet standing in as the witty Pets.com 'Spokes-puppet' were pure marketing genious (although sadly not enough to stop their recent demise).... The book however, is only moderately amusing, and doesn't really capture the humor that was found in the TV commercials. A collection of pictures accompanied by some handwritten captions made for a fairly average read. I'd highly recommend purchasing the actual 'Sock Puppet' from Amazon.com...since I think for the extra few bucks it's more fun to entertain kids or co-workers with the charming little terry-cloth sock, than spending money on this book. Only diehard 'Sock Puppet' fans should spend their money here. I don't mean to be cutting, but I guess I was expecting a little more."
3,Transfiguration of Christian Art Over a Millennium,"The DVD under review introduces viewers to the religious art of Christianity that spans about a millennium. The series starts with the early Christian and Byzantine art and ends with the Gothic art. Superb photography, erudite comments, and non-intrusive background music allow viewers to grasp the evolution of Christian art in different media. Unfortunately, the three-part series shows its age because it was originally released in both 1989 and 1990. The quality of the image is sometimes sub-optimal. This series should be shot again because of the importance of high definition in visualizing art."
2,"When it's hot, it's not",Such a snazzy looking tool! But when dealing with hot items the large paddle becomes too limp to safely manage them. Sorry.
5,fantastic wonderful creative,listen i'm 11 and i so love this game i love cutting barbie and her friend's hair and dying it to one time i was getting kira new look i putted purple eyeshadow red lipstick and cutting her hair short and i loved it i didn't even recognize her she looked so charming and pretty and you should get this idem
2,Unhappy Shopper!,"I bought this game for my 4 yr. old daughter based mostly on the reviews I'd read. I was totally disappointed! The game is so cheap in design, it might as well be an Atari game from way back. The cursor is useless because it stayed behind the picture the whole time, you have to guess at where you're clicking. No matter what shade of lipstick,eyeshadow,etc., you choose, it never changes. It remains the same color it started out as, with the exception of the glitter option. It was a total waste of money!! And I wouldn't reccomend this game for ANYONE! Let alone a child!"
1,"Nothing against the product, but...","I have nothing against this product. As a matter of fact, I had one when I was young and absolutely loved it. The only problem is that you can't run the program on newer Window's operating systems. I tried it on Window's XP and Window's Vista. The program is meant to run on Window's 95 and that is all it works on - believe me. If that is what you have, then you will love this."
1,Overbearing!!!,"This blender is very reasonably priced and looks nice on the counter, but that's about it!It is extremely loud and does a terrible job of chopping up the ice.I am returning mine!"
2,"product may be good, seller not so","Was really psyched about trying this product out to see how it fares compared to other cpu coolers, but it arrived damaged (NOT by UPS) they always do a great job delivering items intact to me. Someone had used the product and then put it back in the box- they had not even bothered to remove the thermal paste properly. As soon as I opened the box I could tell something was not right . Now I paid full price and expedited shipping for junk they tried to pass off as new (did they really think I would not notice??)We shall see if they refund my shipping costs I had to pay to send it back too (LOL)...Point is they are supposed to check all returns before reshipping them out to customers. I have used J&R in the past but not for too many items- I will stick to my better and more reliable suppliers in the future, BTW Amazon rocks and I have NEVER had any problem with anything I have purchased from them. I Buy a ton of stuff from them ."
3,average,"the movie was on par with most of the new ones out there, kids loved it. I have not yet watched it in 3d yet but looking forward to soon."
3,The Pirates. Band of Misfits,Cute with some adult innuendo. Love the stop action technique. Charactors were creative. Story line was different. Weren't distracted by whose voice was each charactor.
1,Wasted night,"We have family movie nights and this movie was picked with some doubt based on the trailer. Should have gone with that feeling. I read some if the reviews and based on that, decided to rent it. Waste of money and waste of a night watching this movie. It was not interesting, the jokes were bad as well as the story line. We kept watching it, hoping it would get better. It did not. If I could have given it zero stars, I would have. Parents, don't waste your time or money on this one. I don't know how it received any good reviews? This movie was one of the worst I have seen in years."
1,BADDDDDD !!!!!!!,"Dont waste your time or your money with this movie. Not funny, a total miss. Get Ice Age or How to Train Your Dragon."
4,Aardman Owns!,"Claymation has been a dying art since its creation. Few groups do it, even fewer do it well. Aardman is the best. Great character development. Love the design. Perfect for the Monty Python lover."
4,Clever British Humor,"A lot of humor meant for adults, but my son (7) loved it, too. It was one I would be willing to watch again. I know I missed a few bits. Much better than most movies these days that are made for kids."
2,Not the best Aardman I have ever seen,"I have been a huge fan of Aardman and all its work up to this point (Chicken Run, Wallace and Grommit), so I was looking forward to seeing ""Pirates! Band of Misfits"". Sadly the trailer not only had all the good parts in it, but the out-of-order snippets made for a more interesting story than the movie itself. Children might enjoy the film for its goofy style, but the usual excellent timing and humor of an Aardman production was definitely missing.If you have been a fan of Aardman then you may well be disappointed. I certainly was. ""It's the wrong trousers!"""
5,Exquisite Soundtrack,"This is by far one of the most exquisite musical pieces I have ever heard...not only does it echo the beauty of the film, but it is in and of itself a true work of art. For me, the music relaxes, invokes peace, and a sense of tranquility. This soundtrack is a must not only for those who enjoyed the movie but for anyone who enjoys fine music."
5,March of the Penguins - Soundtrack,"If the movie was great and magnificent, imagine the music!!! You'll take your stress away if any..."
2,some bad points on product,"the bad thing about this sensor is having to splice the wires and then put them together. also they wouldnt ship to APO, so i had to pay for more shipping to send it to apo once it arrived to the states"
5,Very happy customer.,We are redecorating our home on a very tight budget. The true colors of the valances were displayed on my computer screen. I am so pleased with the product and service as is my husband.
1,Not quite as pictured,"The reason I went with this case over others was for the pictured tongue and groove feature that would lock the case in place. When it arrived, it had no such feature, flat cut. The felt lining gives no indication that one was every planned given that it buts up to the cut almost flush. As a result the case constantly slips off. This is a clear BAIT AND SWITCH. Keep shopping."
2,I tried,"Ok. I have really really tried-hard to get into this book. I just cannot stand the Theo character and the dialogue style. Yes I do realise that the dialogue is part of Theo's character however, it is incredibly annoying and making the whole book an unpleasant read."
1,It produces lemon juice,"Squeeze this machine and get lemon juice. After 4 uses the carburetor fell off. I re-attached the carburetor and on the 6th use the machine began making a loud clanking noise, so I shut it down expecting a limb was caught in the blades, only to find oil pouring out of the engine. I called two service centers and both told me if it was the engine it would prove to be an ""out of oil issue"" and would not be covered by warranty. I am very diligent about checking fluid levels prior to using the equipment, but they said it did not matter. So after 6 uses I placed the machine in the garbage. When the chipper was working it would only accept the smallest limbs and proved to be extremely hard work."
5,Terrific book,"A major achievement-- two engrossing narratives interwoven, each featuring a tough, idealistic, unusual young woman who makes her own path through life. The characters are so convincing they might be your family or your old college roommates. My favorite novel of the year."
5,Wondeful lens,"I am using this tele-extender lens with my new Sony DSC-H5 camera, and it is really great. Sharp and clear, everything one could ask for."
2,Not much to color,"This is a great book if the words of Chaucer are important to you--the ""coloring"" book is filled with text. The pictures are neat in that they're similar to wood-block prints that are contemporary to the period, but they aren't much fun to color, being that they take up a quarter of each page, at best, and aren't very detailed. It would be a great study aid for someone reading The Canterbury Tales, and interesting from a historical enthusiast's viewpoint, but not much fun to color, definitely for an older reader/artist, not really a kids' book."
4,The travelling sales elf,Well balanced. Good replayability. Nice illustrations.Our games group plays it about once a month.
3,Heh,"I'm amused to find this here. It's my Honours dissertation. Only 30 copies were printed. If anyone actually wants a copy, your best bet is an interlibrary loan from Murdoch University, or you could contact me directly."
3,Well done....,"Without a doubt a nice release from Grupo Gale. Almost every track is a tightly arranged, very danceable, energetic blast of Colombian Salsa. The tribute to El Gran Combo is excellent, not to mention ""Ironias"" and ""Descarga Gale"". Other tracks like ""Soy Como Soy"" and ""Buscando Tus Besos"" are catchy tunes, but the coros borderline on too catchy, i.e. annoying.Have you noticed an immense production of Colombian Salsa in the last couple of years that has a quite similar sound to Grupo Gale, even though its from different groups? Start looking at the producer/arranger of those albums and you'll find that its invariably Diego Gale. He's crankin out Cds a mile a minute....a different band fronting the same sound. Guess you'll have to decide for yourself whether that's a good thing or not!"
4,Great Powers vs the Balkan People,"In 1999, the Balkan states, consisting of Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, the former Yugoslavia, Vojvodina, Croatia, and Slovenia, had been the center of two wars that involved all of Europe, Russia, and the United States. So much devastation and bloodshed was unleashed that there remain visible scars in many large cities in the Balkans.Misha Glenny's 700 page 4-star book, The Balkans - Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804 - 1999 tells the story of this period and the history leading up to it.The following is a sentence from the book which characterizes its style:""On the evening of Monday 22 April 1996, a small group of Serbs were enjoying a drink at the Cakor café in Decani in western Kosovo.""Where detailed information is available, the author uses a personal approach to make the complex integrations of Balkan history more clear and interesting."
1,Waste of money do not buy,Don't buy this product unless you want it just to use it as a stand because there will be no popcorn popping out of this crappy machine.
4,It worked great for me!,I read all the reviews on here for this popcorn machine. But I decide to get it anyway. It work great for us! We didn't have any unpopped seeds shooting at us. LOL There wasn't that many unpopped seeds either.
4,Just what I thought it would be!,"My 3 year old wanted a popcorn machine for Christmas. He loves the old fashion look of the big expensive ones he has seen in department stores. Being he is only 3, I figured that this one was just the right size to fit on my counter top. I also liked that it is an air popper. He LOVES it!!! It pops just enough for him with a little left for me and Hubby to snack on. It doesn't pop all the seeds, but I had read other reviews about it and knew it would do this. Not a big deal. It pops most of them. Only about a quarter of them don't pop. They do fall out though. I just put a really big bowl under it to catch the popcorn and seeds that are pushed out.I couldn't be happier. I don't recommend this for someone who wants a lot of popcorn at one time though. It pops less than a bag of microwave popcorn and has to cool before you can pop more. It works for us. We wanted it for the look and the price. It is easy to clean and store. The top comes completely off for storage."
1,Totally dysfunctional machine,"I only got this thing to pop one full bowl of popcorn. After that, it has only been able to pop a few kernels at a time. .then it shuts off until it cools down. It seems that it is overheating...again and again, and in a matter of a few minutes (easily less than 5). Sadly, because i didnt save either the box or the receipt, i have no recourse other than to warn the world that this is surely not worth anyone's moneyI bought this in target. I would never had bought this one if the presto machines had been sold there. this was the only hot air popper they had."
1,A Horrible Popper,"This popper is horrible. Even though it uses no oil or anything, just hot air, it is big and bulky. It can become a storage problem. Also, once some of the popcorn is popped and hot kernels are in the bowl, they will pop, sending prpcorn everywhere!!! If I could, i would give this produst 0 stars. It is a horrible product that is a waste of money. You should buy a different popper, even if it uses oil. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Looks Cute, Works like . . . .","Like one other reviewer said, this popper doesn't pop all the kernals. I got this popper as a birthday present and ended up returning it. When you fill up the measuring cup for kernals, you have to pop it through about 4 cycles before you get most of them popped. As kernals pop, they shoot lots of unpoppped kernals out into the bowl and you have to keep popping them over and over. Also the spout is very large and even with a huge bowl, some kernals went flying across the counter.Don't waste your manoey for looks, buy somethign that works well."
2,"Beautifully Nostalgic, Worthless Performance!","All you need to do is read the title to this post and you should get the gist of how I feel. I think tht it is a wonderful looking machine that brings back alot of memories. However, the good parts stop right there. This machine is not only lacking in performance, but it is flat out a hazard. DO NOT use this machine around young children as the HOT, UNPOPPED kernals that fly out of the machine like shrapnel can (DO) burn little hands. The engineer that came up with the shape design of this item should be on a job hunt!"
1,"Junk, fire hazard.","We got about 6 pops total, over a few months, out of this junk before the thing went nuts and made a bunch of noise and then burned up inside. We got it unplugged quick enough before the outlet burned. Fire hazard!"
1,Either unpopped or overcooked kernels.,"I really like air popped corn and have a popper both at work and at home. However, when I bought this popper, I was amazed at how many kernels went unpopped. The corn that was popped was somewhat burned. Both of these happened because of the design or the popper. I also agreed that it rather large to store. I returned the popper after trying it twice because I was so unhappy with how it did its job."
1,Poor design,"This popcorn maker shoots hot uncooked kernels at you, only about half of the kernels actually pop, so,not only is it a waste of good popcorn, but a safety hazard. I have tried different brands of popcorn. Nothing seems to stop the onslought of lava hot kernels hitting your bowl and flying everywhere. I think this product is also poorly designed, a bowl doesn't even fit properly in front of it, so you have to hold the bowl, like a shield. I would definately not recommend it, and if you do attempt to use it, I suggest hiding the children, the pets, wearing a long sleeve shirt, gloves, and goggles. I am not exagerating, i'ts like being shot with and automatic heated bb gun. DO NOT recommend."
4,Great hot air popper,I think this is a great popper. It makes fluffy popcorn in minutes. It is also cute and looks great on the counter. It also doesn't send kernels flying everywhere like in most reviews. I put butter and salt on top and it tastes good. This is a good popper.
4,Collins Gem Latin Dictionary,"Like other Collins Gem dictionaries, it is a pocket-sized dictionary rather than a huge, full-blown scholar's dictionary. I find it useful for looking up a Latin word here and there so as to determine the etymology of some French, Spanish, or Italian word I encounter. If you have a layman's interest in Latin, it is an ideal addition to a limited library. However, if you are planning to become a Latin scholar, you should seek a larger compilation."
2,Too Small to Read - Brief Simplistic Entries,This is a very small book - only 4 x 2.5 x 2-inches at best. You may need a magnifying glass to read the tiny print. Lookup entry is often a single word - can be misleading. Not a friendly companion when reading latin.
3,this book was ok,This book is a series of ghost stories. The stories are all about some animal/human that dies and haunts whoever killed him or her. My personal favorite was The Ghost of Whispering Oaks. This story is about dogs that had a good life. Then everything went bad when the owners died over time. Later the dogs died over not having enough water or of hunger. Now they haunt anyone that comes near the barn even the new owners.I thought that this book was good and bad. It was good because it always kept me on the edge of my seat. That always makes me want to keep reading .Another reason I like that story is because it gave me goose bumps. One bad thing was that I didn't like was that the stories ended abruptly. I really like endings that have meaning. I think that you will like this book is you like ghost stories.
4,Very Well Done,"This mini series rates at least a 4 star rating. Very well done, fine performances by all. I particularly admire Stacy Keach in this movie.Fictional in nature, it should rank somewhere after North and South and Gone With The Wind.Anyone who likes fiction from the Civil War Era will not want to miss this one. (I cannot rate the new cut version. I intend to keep viewing the original)"
4,VERY GOOD,"This movie is one of the great TV civil war mini-series classics.The reason it seems broken up or dull at times is because the VHS version has edited out some of the original scenes shown on television. Still it is good enough to buy especially if you want a great movie to watch on a rainy saturday afternoon. It gives a good Southern perspective about the Civil War, that is missing in today's civil war movies for whatever reason. Just remember that this was made in the early 80's. A Very Good movie."
4,The Blue & the Gray (The Complete Miniseries),"I liked this miniseries a lot when it aired back in the 1980s. Because the 2 main characters are an artist who recorded the war for newspapers & a Union officer who was a ""ranger,"" they were able to function as the Forest Gumps of the Civil War... the ""everyman"" who was everywhere. I'd taped it back then, but my tapes finally died, so I thought enough of it that I splurged."
2,Cut to pieces... Get the Original Version,"Be warned. This is NOT a special edition with added footage. This ""Recut"" version is a drastically shortened 5 hour cut of the original almost 7 hour long epic mini-series. The original uncut version is still available on Amazon's website. Why Sony/Columbia is releasing this is beyond me. Who, aside from those with ADD would want to purchase a truncated version? The series is presented on 2 discs, compared to 3 discs on the original. It is in fullscreen with 2.0 mono sound and optional English and French subtitles."
5,A True Account of the Civil War,"This movie spotlights the impact that the Civil war could have on an American family. It showed that there truely was not a winner because both sides, North and South, suffered much loss. The acting by Lloyd Bridges, Stacy Keach, etc. was outstanding. I would recommend taking the time to see this masterpiece."
4,Blue and the Gray,Never got to watch this due to working retail hours when it was on network TV. Very good movie. Would prefer that the intro be ommitted between eposodes.
2,We didn't enjoy this game.,"My wife and I purchased this game after reading all the positive reviews. We play a lot of different types of board games (Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, etc.) and were looking for a fun, light, card game to play. This game felt more like a 2-player version of solitaire. Also, why buy this game? Basically, read the rules at Rio Grande Games (The link is posted in my comments, Amazon won't let me post it here).Then, take a STANDARD deck of cards and:1. Put each Ace in a row on the table, these are the 'Expeditions'.2. The Kings, Queens, and Jacks are your 'Investment Cards'.3. Play the game as normal.In the Lost Cities card game you have 5 suits instead of 4. That's the only difference between buying the game and my version of using a standard deck."
2,Not cooperative or engaging,"The game is portrayed as if the experience is two players working together or charting their own paths versus the game's obstacles. But in reality, it's strictly competitive, and you win by thwarting the other player. The gameplay is rather simplistic and somewhat boring. I cannot say I would recommend this, even for someone seeking simple fun."
1,Useless.,"There's not much in the way of helpful on-screen cues while RoboPDF is processing--it did indeed appear to lock up my PC, but it was just being very slow.But after waiting for the output, I discovered that RoboPDF did not convert the great majority of the cross-references in my Word document to hyperlinks. And, to complete the picture, the hyperlinks that were created ALL deliver the user to the wrong page! I can't deliver a file in that condition.It is absoulutely astounding that a ""name"" company like Macromedia would consider releasing a product when it can't perform the most basic functions. They offer NO phone support for this product; all they offer is an online forum which they don't post to--the forum is just filled with unanswered questions and problems from other users."
3,It ok,It was OK but it was really annoying to read because I kept asking y she's so stupid but I guess that's what love does to you
2,"Good, but not so good","This is a beautiful memento of that very special wedding day. Very nicely done, however without CC or subtitles. My copy is flawed in that sound and picture are not synchronized. Perhaps mine is the exception."
4,Excellent Video,We were able to watch this wedding in Australia direct from the BBc in London and it was very well covered.Thanks to Amazon we arse now able to have our own copy which is in very good shape. The exciting event is well covered on the BBc's DVd and will always bring back great memories when it is watched again.
2,"FOR SHAME, BBC!","I will just say that if not for one glaring unforgivable omission, this would be a 5 star dvd. But for those of us (all) who wanted this as a keepsake of this magical, iconic event, the integrity and keepsake value of this DVD is vastly and sadly reduced, because of the glaring, glaring, absence of even one single milisecond of one sngle frame of one single shot of the unique, unprecedented, and now LEGENDARY ride in the blue Aston Martin, one of the (if not THE ) most memorable shots of this most historic event. Without it, shame shame shame. Someone in the BBC editing room, and his/her supervisor, made a huge mistake. Bad form, BBC. I'll be looking for a better product from this momentous day from the folks at NBC/Universal."
3,DVD,DVD disc was of suspect quality. Loads extremely slow. Took several trues even to get disc to run. But what should I expect for $5.00?
2,DIsappointed,"I purchased this DVD with much anticipation and was very disappointed.The DVD kept stopping, freezing and the sounds would stutter. I purchased this so my granddaughters could watch the princess get married. Luckily all they wanted was to see the princess because that's all they saw.SO....I have history and the DVD should be."
5,great item,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter in law. she was thrilled with it, she will be watching it many times."
2,Prose disappoints,"I read a lot of fantasy and horror. I've read it since I was a kid, so I know what's good. This isn't good. The prose is choppy and the storyline is tired. I think in a few years, if he works on his style, he'll be a decent writer. But right now, there are only glimmers of this. I cannot recommend this book."
4,Heated chip and dip tray,I find this to be a great product it is to bad that they don't manfacture the product anymore that is what I was told I find it works great with cheese the only problem I find is the unit does not have a temperature shut off switch to where the cheese won't burn otherwise it is a great product
5,Excellent and handy product,"This product is worth it's weight in gold. Excellent for hot dips, or even taco's. Heats up fast and keeps food hot, not just warm. Highly recommended."
5,Emmet Found - Family Tradition & Harmony Restored,"Thanks Amazon for having Emmet, and getting me back into the graces of my now 20 year old daughter. I somehow taped over the hbo copy we had been watching for years -- Oh, the family crises. I also ordered a copy for her younger sister. Now we can once again enjoy the story and songs that made Emmet Otter a Christmas tradition at our house."
2,Poor Quality Version of Christmas Classic,"Some problems: 1) Picture looks slightly out of focus at times. 2) The audio mix emphasizes the music instead of the vocals, making it difficult to decipher some of the song lyrics. I tried every audio setting available and none sounded as good as my old copy on VHS. These are Muppets, it's not like we can read their lips or anything. 3) One of the ""edits"" makes no sense. Towards the beginning, when Emmet's mom is annoyed that the woman won't pay her this week for the laundry, her voice (in another version) trails off saying ""Why don't you just fall...off...the...dock."" But in this DVD version, the last four words are edited out. So when another character says, ""That's telling her Alice!"" he's not referring to anything. All in all, this DVD is very disappointing and I can't recommend it, even though I love the story."
5,I saw this TOO many times!,""" Look at the birds up in da trees"""" Hay, were not birds, we are a jug band"""
5,An EXCELLENT film for kids of all ages!,"I adore this film! Even as an adult, I sometimes sneak this movie into the VCR to enjoy! What a delight. This is a feel-good movie, and a must for any home with children of any age."
3,pyramat PM220,"Bought this item a year ago. Very heavy chair, worked great for a year. My son turned the volume on switch to hard and now the chair is broken. Very hard to get repaired, if you can find someone to repair it. The warranty is only for 90 days. I called the company, not very helpful. Would not buy this brand again."
5,Great season...,This season is turning out to be awesome. Love Rachel being portrayed as a sexy young woman. I can't wait to see what the rest of the season has in store for us Gleeks!!!!
4,Great episode,Didn't see this coming...Everyone? Do long distance relationships never work? Every couple had their moment in the spotlight. Fun to see all the flashbacks.
3,Sigh...the magic is gone...,"I'm not enjoying this season so far at all. I'm not even going to buy season 4 here on Amazon.Forget that I have not cared for most of the songs so far...The writers would have done far better to have just gotten us used to the new kids and kept it about the McKinley High glee club. It's so disjointed and the stories are spread too thin. I can't even think of any of the new kids names right now.What would have been better is to have last year's seniors just pop in here and there as guests. The way the show is now I could care less for the new kids, we've hardly gotten to know them. Let the graduated cast go. I'd miss the original cast members, but there's too much going on now to have any character development of the new glee club kids. I'm not even sure I'm going to keep watching. What were they thinking??"
3,not as good as the last season,"I've been a fan of glee since the beginning. Not that I hate season 4, just feels like the old glee can't let go. Move on.. you have graduated already. I still watch faithfully.. dedicated fan"
2,Going downhill fast,Story line is deteriorating seriously. Emma's abandoning her wedding made no sense. Characters in NYC disconnected from characters in Ohio.
5,Awesome!!!,"Still a great show after 4 seasons. Very entertaining! The new group is meshing well with the veterans. I can't wait to see what happens with Blaine and Kurt (but please, prostate cancer? Kurt's dad has been through enough!). Rachel's new beau at NYADA is a tall step up from Finn, and Rachel is having the time of her life (except that dance instructor from h#!!)."
2,Jumped the shark,"I loved First Season of Glee, I enjoyed second & third. I had high hopes for the 4th but it just left me with a sense of blah until it left me wondering 'why am I watching this...'. The separation of the gang, the 100% transition to mini music videos of the top songs of today instead of plot demanded songs from the range of time and genre, and overall the loss of strong acting talents leaves this season as the one proving that it should have ended when graduation came."
2,Don't try This at Home,"Ed Roseman has written a charming book, but has provided the reader with an inadequate explanation of its subject matter. I had to ask my trumpet instructor more than once to explain what Mr. Roseman failed to provide in the way of information about the concepts presented here. The student either has to guess or find the information elsewhere in order to avoid getting lost. I definitely do not recommend this book for anyone new to the subject of music theory unless they have access to someone well versed on the subject, such as a music teacher."
2,Wha?,"I gave this book a 2 because the writing is excellent. However, the characters are all unlikeable. They act irresponsibly and disrespectfully and none of them seems to learn anything. The whole race thing seems disassociated. Daniel and Iris are not torn apart because of color. They're torn apart because they are in committed relationships with other people and worse, kids are involved. I disagree with some of the other reviewers that the ending is unsatisfying; there is no ending. What about Hampton? Will their son improve or become a serial killer? Is Iris pregnant and why would that be a good thing at that point? Will Kate get on with her life and move back to NYC already? It doesn't have to be tied up in a neat little package, but give me something."
2,Horrible ending!!!,"My wife found it so disappointing, she made me read it just to see what I thought about it. Well, I agreed. The story itself was not too bad, but the tragedies that brought it towards the conclusion don't fit.My big problem with this book was the ending. Seems like the author just got tired of writing and butchered it at the end. The ending is pretty bad and abrupt. So for that reason the book is not worth reading."
1,Please don't waste your time reading this,"I bought this book for $3 and I definitely paid too much. I don't know why I even finished reading the book. Although the back of the book makes it look intriguing, it is a silly book. I found myself frustrated with the fact that the author went into detail about a character which led no where. It does not flow together as a well written novel should. The racial issues discussed in the book are not enlightening, they are irritating."
1,A Ship Wreck,"Based on reviews I read, I looked forward to reading A Ship Made Of Paper. I tried very hard to give the author every chance to make up for something stupid in the plot. He failed. While this book could have made some very positive statements about interracial love, it continuously plodded through very negative racial stereotypes. Many of the characters, not just the main characters, validated so much of the negative perceptions we have about each other. Although fiction, I wonder just how much of this was based on personal experience. The ending was miserable. I closed the book and said to myself, ""what a waste of time!"""
1,they are probably all reconditioned,"I bought this grinder new at Lowes, and did not use it for about 6 months. Once in my new shop, I installed a new light bulb following the easy assembly of the components, turned on the motor and the light bulb blew out instantly, probably due to the heavy vibration from the imbalanced wheels, and within about 1 minute the variable speed control would not function. I managed to balance the wheels with the dressing tool that is supplied, and the grinder runs on full speed now all the time. I will probably buy a new speed controller from a local electronics store to fix it myself. I am reluctant to buy any more Delta products due to the poor quality of this tool."
3,correction to official review:,"Note to Anne Hurley who wrote the ""official"" review:Armando Acosta is NOT an Italian director. He is an American of Spanish heritage who currently resides in Belgium. Not sure why she thought he is Italian."
2,It's not as good as the first!,I thought this book was weak...Especially the ending! It needed a better explanation. The first was way better!
2,What is happening?,"I swear it, R.L. Stines books are getting worse and worse each book! If you feel the same, than you should try L.J. Smith's books. All her books that I've read got 5 stars to me! I mean she is way better than Stine! This book of course was boring, a little. The ending was pretty weak too! The only reason I started reading Seniors was beacause it had the description of the charaecters wich was cool. Other than that this book sucked!"
5,I love Stine!!!!!!!!,I think that RL Stines books are great I liked this one along with the rest of the books that go with the serie. The Seniors books are the best on so far. I love to read them to find out if they are all going to die. If you don't like RL Stine thenn there is something seriously wrong with you. Well thats all.
1,"An ""interesting"" reEd.","This collection of myths deserves less than one star! While there are a variety of myths, the versions are so awful that their true meaning is often missed. There are spelling, punctuation, and other mistakes throughout World Mythology. Even searching for the myths on the internet provides better versions that are not censored or over-edited. Take Beowulf for example, Ms. Rosenberg explains in its introduction that Anglo-Saxons used kennings in their works, which is true. However, they did not use kennings for every descriptive phrase. On the other hand, Ms. Rosenberg hyphenates so many words an all of the hyphens put together would equal the length of the large intestines stretched around a Swedish meatball! Which is ridiculous!!!! (Just like her interpretations.)"
1,Go Somewhere Else,"I received my book a week before the class was over, luckily the local library was more reliable. Additionally they don't give refunds, maybe it's because they know there service sucks and would lose a lot of money......hmmmmm."
3,"Solid game, but man is it ugly...","No one in our game group considers Medici their favorite board game, but everyone enjoys it and it hits the table with enduring regularity. That sounds like faint praise, but there are very few games in our vast collection that get revisited over and over. The trouble with this edition of Medici is that graphic design is terrible. Each of five commodities has a single illustration that is recycled over and over again, most annoyingly, as the background for the scoring track. Combined with an unbelievable purple-to-orange color fade over the entire board and box, and fonts that make one commodity indistinguishable from the next, this game is a hot mess. This is a big dissappointment coming from a great publisher like Rio Grande. Having said that, I would buy second copy if they elevated the design to their typical standards of production."
5,I love this game!,"This is a simple and straightforward game that can be played with two people. I love the last part since most strategy games require 3 or more, so this makes the game even more compelling.The money spent on Carcassone is a far better deal than dropping $30+ for two see a movie at the theatre. If you are debating getting the game, just stop thinking and buy it!"
5,A great game for all ages,This is a real laid back game that can be great for just about any family. It is almost impossible for the game to repeat itself so it will never really get old.
5,"GREAT: fast, simple, interactive, some luck",This is a great game!It's fast 30-45minIt's got some luck! but not too much... also makes you adapt to your situation... there is not only 1 way of winning!it is strategicvery easy to learn!!
5,So much fun!,"Carcassonne is a great game with a medieval theme. Players deploy knights, thieves, farmers, and monks onto tiles containing cities, roads, fields, and cloisters. The tiles build onto one another to create a land that is unique to each game session. Explaining how to play it makes it sound more difficult than it actually is, but once you get going, it's not that hard. A bit of strategy is involved, but a bit of luck is as well. This game is fun for all ages!"
4,Beware: does not include the River Expansion as advertised,"This is a fine game, I've played it before and bought it for my kid. However, although this product photo and description both clearly indicate this includes the river expansion pack, Amazon only shipped the basic game without the expansion pack. If you buy this game (and it is fun), be sure to check your box before you open it to be sure they sent the correct item."
3,A great family game,"This is a great little family game. Easy to learn fun to play. Only complaint from my family was too little violence, sigh, what ya gonna do :^)."
4,Euro board game,"I have played only once but think it will be a good game, especially when playing with my grandsons. The only time I played it was with one of my grandsons. We both enjoyed it and I look forward to playing again the next time he is visiting."
5,Great game for everyone.,"Good introduction to some more complex board games. Pretty simple to understand, but the nature of the game ensures that no two games will end up the same. Also can be finished rather quickly (~40 minutes), so great if you dont have a couple hours available to really dig into a game."
1,not good,"I only paid $.75 + POSTAGE for this dvd, but it wasn't even worth that. I threw it away. All it was was a video of pictures of Australia that weren't even good. What a waste of effort."
1,Very poor quality,"Amazon has the brand mislabeled as Apex, but it is Ipex. Cardboard box arrived spilt open and plastic carrying case was cracked--obviously it was never intended to hold so much weight. The rubber handles are very hard and already coming apart. The ""chrome"" paint is already peeling before even one use. Also, buyers should be aware that you can only increase the weight in 5lb increments, and if you plan on using both dumbbells at the same time, the maximum weight on each is 15lbs (If i would have thought about it, when I purchased it I would have realized both of these). Overall very poor quality. I will try to return."
4,works for me,"I have not set up all of the buttons but it tracks perfectly, is ergonomic, and does fairly well on batteries."
4,A different view,A great show of this band's talent in departing from traditional jazz confines. I'd love to see them live.
1,Horrible!!!,This purse was so small I expected it to be a little bigger than it was. My wallet doesn't even fit inside of the purse!!! Also the picture is NOT what I recieved!!! It was not red on the bottom or the strap. It was silver and I just recieved the package a couple days ago and the silver on the bottom of the purse and sides is flaking off!!! I can't believe this would happen!!! I thought it would be an amazing purse because I look everywhere for I love lucy purses and I can never find one I love and In the picture I loved it and if it looked like the picture I would be happy!!! So disappointed!!!
4,Interesting,This book was interesting. I like learning more about the ancient greek philosophies and Socrates dialogue was interesting.
2,fun with cat stencils,"Well if you are little kid these might be nice. If you are older, maybe not. I wasn't pleased with them,but I not a little kid."
1,Junk dvd's,"I bought 2, 100 pack spindles of these DVD's....80% of them won't record. Error Code E4 5403780...This happens on two different DVD recorders !!"
3,"Great disc, lousy shipping","As most everyone says, Verbatim makes very reliable recordable discs. But I'm taking off two stars for Amazon's inferior packaging. My cake box was laid on its SIDE in the carton with a few air pillows on top. Predictably, the case was damaged but fortunately none of the disks was. I can't afford to waste time on damaged shipments so I'm ordering elsewhere in the future."
4,No complaints,"Good buy, fast shipping and they work great. Use them all the time to record my home movies and for other projects. Never had any problems with them yet..."
1,Don't waste your money,"I received these DVDs about a week ago. Have tried to burn 10 DVDs, out those 10 only 4 were good. The rest have been coasters. Don't hold out much hope for the rest at this rate. Very very disappointed!!!!Addendum to my above review;;3/4 of the way thru the stack and these dvd's have been horrible.. every other one is a coaster.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
5,Stable burning,"Have absolutely no complaints about these discs at all. The main issue is with getting any dirt on them before a burn (as is the case with all DVD-R/RW products). Also, when are the decent speed Verbatim Dual Layers coming out that are at a reasonable cost?"
1,not whar it used to be,this was a great product before. now i would say at least a third of the discs don't record and some were not produced correctly. they seemed to almost be coming apart. i wouls suggest try sony or another brand.
1,Won't work with HP Burner,"Now I'm not saying that these disks are no good, they just didn't work for me. I'm using a Hp dvd480 burner and it just will not read them. None. Not one was read. I found that my memorex are better."
4,It works,"Actually, I still in love with Verbatim for long time.Those DVD works as any DVD media, an only disappointment is - it's noisy.It' will not destroy or damage your drive, but just made lot of noise.And that is OK with me, since I use it for temporary storage only, but for long time kipping movie I'll suggest something else."
5,5 Starz,I have Great success with the Verbatim +R and I produce DVD's for a variety of corporate and family productions !
2,A little dull,"I sat down to watch this, and within just the first couple minutes I knew I'd be bored. I guess I was expecting more of a wide shot of earth, but the camera is zoomed in close on almost every shot and makes it difficult to even tell what you are looking at at times. And because it's so close, they do this annoying pan with every shot so you can see the whole thing, and that got me a little dizzy. And it just wasn't smooth, because it cuts to a new video about every 7 seconds. It's not something you can just sit and watch, but I guess if you have it on at a party or something, it's ok, as long as it's for your grandparents or something. I have to say the music is pretty good and goes with what you are watching, but as with all dvds of this type, you can play your own soundtrack. I noticed that this is the first dvd in a series, so maybe they've done a better job on the newer ones."
1,Oceania,Just terrible. This is a terrible video which does not show any islands or beaches or anything else. It is just featureless satellite photographs with an accompaniment of empty piano music.
3,Insulting title,"I always find it ""interesting"" that certain topics feel the need to have ""special instruction"" for women.... i.e., ""investing for women"", ""car repair for women"", and now ""buying a home for women"". I guess women are more ignorant when it comes to these topics? They need to be spoken to differently? Buying a home is buying a home, and the issues are no different for men and women. SURE, maybe women are treated differently by brokers, mortgage lenders, etc., but then, if you have been a woman your whole life(!), you have probably already figured out how to handle yourself in the world. I feel books such as this one are just pandering and feeding into the whole idea that women are somehow more ""fragile"" and need to be spoken to like little children, and in simple, short phrases, so that their ""delicate minds"" don't overload. I find such a mentality insulting and ignorant, and just a cheap ploy by the authors to get certain susceptible women to buy their product."
2,NO WONDER DETROIT DECLINED.,"No wonder Detroit declined if this book and Made in Detroit by Clemens are the best one can come up with for an explanation of Detroit's demise. I went to Detroit Labor Day of 2004 and thought it looked liked it had been hit by a neutron bomb. I have yet to find a book that gives a truly thoughtful analysis of what happened to Detroit.This book is unimaginably poorly written and disorganized. Is the author dyslexic?. Chock full of ""more on this later"" and ""which I discussed earlier"". But this book has some amazing facts on the Republic of New African and Aretha Franklin's pastor dad's collusion with black militants. So it is the better of the two books for insights.Despite the bad writing I would have given it 3 stars for the amazing facts except it peters out badly near the end as the author, a former chief of the Detroit P.D., dwells on his definitions of good policing."
4,"It's no Puppy Peek-a-Boo, but still a great board book","My daughter LOOOOOOVES Puppy Peek-a-Boo with illustrations by Lisa McCue. I was searching for other peek-a-board books and found this one, which was highly recommended by other parents. It's good, and she does like it - we got it when she was just under 1 year old, and her appreciation of it has grown as she has gotten just a bit older (she's nearly 15 months now). I think it would be ideal for children 2 or older.My only reason for not giving it 4 stars is that I don't think it's on par with Puppy Peek-a-Boo (which sounds so ridiculous as I write this, but it's true). That book has such incredible illustrations and so many little hidden surprises and details that allow readers to find new things each time. This is much different.I have not found anything in the board book realm to equal Puppy Peek-a-Boo, but as board books go, this one is very good (as is Peek-a-Who? by the same author)."
4,My toddler really enjoys this series,"I wasn't as impressed with the ""story"" in this one, I like the rhymes of Peek a Who and Ready Set Go, better. But my toddler really loves the peek a boo pages that she can turn by grabbing the 'hole' in the middle of the page."
3,toddler doesn't care for it,"My son likes lift the flap books like ""where is baby's belly button"" and ""where are baby's easter eggs"" and could read them 100x in a row. He doesn;t like this or the ready set go. the illustrations are modern and I like the concept of the book, but it doesn't appeal to my son. he's 2 1/2. I saw the reading level was listed as 4 - 8. I cannot see an 8 year old being very interested in this book."
1,DONT BUY!,"when you recieve this, the bottle tells you to go online to read the prop65 warning. which is the warning that THIS PRODUCT CAUSES CANCER!"
4,Anchor Bay Does It Again,"Here is another excellant DVD from Anchor Bay. They have done marvelous things with this and other Hammer films. Lust for a Vampire, while not known as one of Hammers great films is in my opinion well worth the price of the DVD. Of course while Lee and Cushing would have made it all the better it is still one of the better, later Hammer films. My only problem with this picture is the silly song, Strange Love!!! Very distracting and totally uncalled for. Im hoping to see the other two in this trilogy,Vampire Lovers and Twins of Evil, offered on DVD soon."
5,Highly recomended!,"As a homeschooling mother of four, the best testament for this book came the day the children began to use it for ideas and inspiration. Anna Kealoha has a beautiful and thoughtful attitude about how, why and when to teach our own whether homeschooling or not."
4,Mooch Moves...,"Fante is better than Bukowski. I loved Buk while in college, but Fante has taken the torch for me. LA, at least the crappy parts of it, are tangible in Mooch. You feel the heat, smell the smoke, and taste the booze I understood the protagonist's sauce problem with even more reality than I did in Chump Change. Every word is perfect in the text and the story flows as smoothly as a cool bottle of Mad Dog 20/20.Pick it up- you'll be glad you did."
3,"Kessinger, great! SRCA, mediocre.","My hat's off to Kessinger Publishing for making this book available. Like their other reprints, most of this book is a facsimile of the original document. This makes part of the degrees difficult to read, but it's a lot better than them trying to interpret a lousy copy and fouling up the ritual.As for the content itself, I have to say that the ritual strikes me as extremely un-inspired. I really hope that the SRIA and other Masonic Rosicrucean organizations have better rituals to work with, because I found it weak and lacking in many places.Addendum: I have to add, months later, that like all ritual, it really can't be truly evaluated until experienced. The three Masonic blue lodge degrees, for instance, must seem very boring when read, but are life-changing and profound when experienced. Please take my previous review with a grain of salt, and approach this work (like all others) with an open mind."
4,Good product - Packed poorly,"The machine itself is of decent quality, a bargain for the price. The company however has basicly no internal packing material in the box and the box itself is thin cardboard which is not appropriate for such a heavy item. The box was destroyed by the time it reached my house and I can't blame the shipping company. The machine itself suffered damage on 5 parts in shipping. I have yet to call the company for replacement parts."
5,Long time fan,"I was 18 when this show was recorded and I was a Whitesnake fan since the '87 album. I also collected the back catalog, including Coverdale's work with Deep Purple. I think 1990 is when they hit their peek. I remember seeing clips of this show and I always wished it would be released on DVD. It only took 21 years, but it's finally here. I haven't seen it yet, but I can't wait to relive my childhood memories. After 1990, I think Coverdale went downhill quite a bit. I'm not a fan of the stuff after the 90's.On the other hand if you are a fan of his former band mate in Deep Purple, Glenn Hughes, he is still awesome. Check outBlack Country Communion 2. Hughes is still better than ever."
1,Difficult to follow along,Following along with the computerized music and tablature has proven impossible. I write all down on paper then come back after I learn it and the animation just messes with my head and it all falls apart.Also for a deluxe edition there is a lot missing accessories and the games are lame.I don't recommend it.
1,Expensive and not fun,"Sorry but both my daughters, 5 and 7, find this game dull. They both play the piano and I was hopeing this was a good tool to help them but I can't get them to use it for very long. I thought it was expensive but was willing to spend the money if it was worth it but it was not."
2,Great item but NOT steel,"I had a set previously purchased at a Pfaltzgraff outlet but lost one big cover when I accidentally turned on the wrong burner, so I finally ordered a new set to replace it. These are the same colors (Blue & green like the Ocean Breeze pattern - not the purple shown) but they are NOT STEEL. They are very flimsy, more like tin. I am disappointed, but maybe I can find another steel set on eBay for when these will inevitably get dings and dents in them. I am disappointed, but they were cheap."
5,DR. JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE,DR. JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE IS ON ONE OF THE BETTER MOVIES OF THE HAMMER FILM COLLECTION. A REAL GENDER BENDER. FIRST HAND OF LOOKING AT THE FIGHT OF SEXES. IF YOU HAD NOT SEEN THIS MOVIES PLEASE DO SO. I WON'T BE SURPRISE IF THEY DID RECREATION OF THIS MOVIE.
3,Needs preamp too,"Added external preamp to bring input up to computor level, then works great. Am recording from 1920's 78 rpm records first played on the old wind up horn players...smooth and sweet with little hiss and noise...nice.Mounted to a Garrard AT6 changer arm easily."
1,You get what you pay for,This plastic space helmet was chosen for its price. We should have spent a little more. It seems poorly designed and my son wanted to take it off immediately.
1,can't buy it :(,I want to buy this movie but it doesn't exist in amazon.co.uk for region 2 (for Turkey).It's only for region 1 :(
5,A Quick But Poignant Read...,"This book is not to be missed! James Cameron's retelling of his lynching is told with true artistry. Cameron seems to have a knack for knowing when his work is finished, when a sentence more or a sentence less would ruin the work. This is one that will stay with you for years!"
3,"So, so","The product does what it's supposed to do but, when you are the only person one side of the bed as high the other side is low. At least that's what I have found when you use this system on a queen size bed."
1,Loud and Horible Customer Service,"First, the product. The description said it was quiet and fast inflating. Not sure what ""quiet"" means to them, but this practically shook the house when turned on to inflate. Also, it seemed to take quite a while to inflate. It was not up to my expectations at all.So, since I was not happy, I thought, ""I'm not going to use it, I will return it."" I contacte Amazon to return, and since this was a 3rd party seller, they forward my request to them. That was the end of that. Never heard from them, never got a chance to return it, no phone call, no email. Just one unhappy customer."
3,LEAKY LIFT SYSTEM,"I HAVE USED THIS LIFT SYSTEM FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS AND AT FIRST IT WAS GREAT, BUT AFTER ABOUT TWO MONTHS IT STARTED TO BLEED DOWN OVERNIGHT AND WILL NOT HOLD THE SELECTED LIFT POSITION. I HAVE CHECKED IT FOR LEAKS AND THE BLADDER IS NOT LEAKING.I SUSPECT THAT IT IS THE VALVES IN THE PUMP THAT ARE LEAKING ABOVE A CERTAIN PRESSUE POINT. I STILL USE IT BUT I HAVE TO PUMP IT UP EVERY NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO BED.IT WAS WONDERFUL WHEN IT WORKED PROPERLY. IT JUST DIDN'T LAST VERY LONG."
5,BED GENIE,WORKS GREAT AND WITH ANY MATTRESS. DUE TO SEVERE NECK INJURIES I CAN NOW SLEEP BETTER AT A SLIGHT INCLINE. THANKS ....
2,needs more functionality.,"First thing is that it leaked at the hose junction. Glued the connection with a type of ""crazy"" glue that stay's flexible. Held air after I fixed it.I liked that it can stay under the mattress and fully deflate to be flat.It was only stable if fully inflated. I found the angle at full inflation to be too much.Any less than full inflation, it becomes unstable and thereby aggrevating and unusable. Move to one side the other will push up. stay in the middle both ends will be around your ears, ect.If they can fix that major design flaw, they would have a great product. Also a hose juntion that CAN'T leak. They just have a hose shoved in a junction.I stopped bothering to inflate it at all, then I eventually took it out from under the mattress completely."
1,mattressgenie,I purchased the Mattressgenie Sept. 16. It was great til about a week ago; now it looses air and won't stay inflated. Very disapointed
4,Gift After Surgery,"This lift works very good and I would recommend it to any one needing head-of-bed elevation for whatever reason. They save you from using blocks to elevate the head of the bed plus allowing for up and down and inbetween posiioning which cannot be done with blocks. Certainly costs less than purchasing the ""flexable"" beds."
3,GENIE MATTRESS LIFT,"THIS WAS PURCHASED FOR UNDER A FUTON.PROS: IT WORKED REASONABLY WELL TO RAISE THE HEAD OF BED AND WAS CHEAPER THAN AN ELECTRIC BED, BY FAR. IT HELPED TO GET MY HUSBAND OUT OF BED WHEN HE WAS HAVING A LOT OF LOW BACK PAIN.CONS: MADE AS MUCH NOISE AS A VACUUM CLEANER. DID NOT RAISE THE BED EVENLY, TENDING TO RAISE THE LESS LOADED SIDE FIRST. AT FIRST IT DID NOT DEFLATE PROPERLY, MAKING A HIGH PITCHED NOISE INSTEAD. AT THAT POINT I REALIZED THERE WAS NO ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT THE PROBLEM. LUCKILY, THE PROBLEM DID NOT PERSIST THE NEXT DAY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A HEADBOARD IT TENDS TO SCOOT BACKWARDS. IT WORKED BEST UNDER A FUTON (LESS THICK). LATER TRIED IT UNDER A REGULAR MATTRESS. THIS STILL WORKED BUT WAS MORE CUMBERSOME AS IT IS HARDER FOR A THICKER MATTRESS TO BEND. IF YOU WANT YOUR BED IN A FIXED ELEVATED POSITION, A BED WEDGE WOULD BE EVEN CHEAPER."
4,elevated bed,"The ""Genie"" works very well. You can elevate your head from one inch to as high as possible. Easy to install. Once it is installed you never have to worry again. The best part is the cost. Try pricing an adjustable bed of any sort and you'll understand what I mean."
2,Not worth the money,The pump is noisy and it stopped working after a month. The pillow does not hold air an d when you do get it pumped up if your bed partner moves so do you. You also slide down the mattress when trying to sleep. Worst money I ever spent on a product.
4,Pokemon Trainers! Here Is the Review For You!,"For Trainers withPokemon Fire Red Version/Pokemon Leaf Green Version/Pokemon Emerald Version, this item will broaden your experience. You can wirelessly link up and battle or trade. No cables required! You can also enjoy features like Two Island's Game Corner. So if you want to trade or battle with friends, or just make your experience more enjoyable, this item is a great place to start!"
5,A revelation,"This recording of Il Giuramento was for me the operatic discovery of the year. I heard it on the radio and got it right away at Amazon. The partiture is beautiful, dramatic and gentle at once, and the voices are glorious. Placido Domingo seems to have learned the score in 4 days, according to the booklet.Rarely a new opera touches me as much as this one did. How is it possible that an opera of such intrinsic quality is so unknown?I strongly recommend it and I am sure it will give you unlimited pleasure."
4,To slog or not to slog...,"So there I was slogging through a young author's account of her conversion from Judaism to Christianity, complete with a multitude of ""foreign"" phrases that should have annoyed me, but...fascinated me. The insight Lauren Winner offers into the Jewish experience on her path to accepting Jesus is thought-provoking, such that I don't believe I'll ever read the Old Testament again without a deeper appreciation for the Jewish people and their culture. Okay, so I wasn't slogging..."
4,Great present,My daughter asked for this book and was delighted to get. It arrived in plenty of time and looked great.
3,Web World,"In this tape you get The Killing Jar and Web World. The only redeming value of The Killing Jar is that it doesn't do any damage to the Transformer continuity. But Web World, this has to be the best episode in Season 3. It was well written and intelligent considering it was meant for young children. It explains why Galvatron is so crazed and actually has some events leading up to Galvatron's experimentation. I would recommend this tape just for that episode, The Killing Jar is almost not even worth watching."
4,Simple Pleasures lives up to its name,"This was one of the first CD's that I purchased from the Unison/Jazz Cafe series. The first tune has a bit of a Art Poter-esque/Dave Koz-ish vibe, and the last one has a Ralf Illenberger-ish/Acoustic Alchemy/Miles Davis-like vibe to it as well. The second one-in my opinion reminds me of a Joyce Cooling/Al Di Meola mix. I definitely smell a hint on Jazz Fusion on that one. It's been a while since I last played it, but every time I do play it, those simple pleasures in life (which we so often take for granted, or worse yet, overdo 'em) come to mind. Seen and heard-the album's last track-is the one that will either put you in the kind of trance that keeps you focused with a capital 'F', or just fast foward what's left of the mood that you're in for the day and just fade off to your own view of euphoria......either way, you won't be dissapointed.RJ"
5,Worship To a New Level!!!!!,"In a word - - - - DISC 2 FIRST!!!!! If your Worship is not what it should be, Purchase the CD AND the DVD IMMEDIATELY!!!! You will never Worship your Lord the same. This is not merely a concert or recording, it is a time filled with unscripted, unashamed and complete adoration for God. I was so full by the time I was a third of the way thru the DVD, I couldnt move from my prostrate position. Totally humbled by and completely surrendered to the glory of my God. You will be trememdously blessed and understand that it is NOT about YOU.If you can get up - - ....look at and listen to CD #1 which is the Praise disc. Oh, trust me, Praise will be in order!"
5,Don't leave home without it!,"2 cats go in. Although, I could fit in 3 without any problems. After a couple of trips, they are always looking forward to their outside excursions. Wish I had it sooner."
2,A good book for beginners who actually don't know anything.,"In my opinion. If you want to earn a lot money then do computing. If you want to do computing then learn something. To learn something you must practice. If you want to practice a lot and learn a lot then try more and more examples in books. To try some examples look at the book which has got a lot of examples. This book has a lot. But they don't work at all... The CD has no enough references(library) which are available, you'll get 100's of compilation errors(mostly about recordsets, etc). So if you want to do computing then don't buy this book, I did, it was a mistake"
1,How to make VBA impossibly confusing,"The book seems to be written with the objective of showcasing how much the authors know about VBA without imparting any of this understanding to the reader. ""Don't try to understand this now, we will explain it later"" is used in almost every chapter. The concepts and syntax are poorly narrated and the text suffers from the needless and boring injection of the authors humor. If you wish to understand VBA, buy the Access 2000 VBA handbook by Susan Novalis. I learned more that I could practically apply to my databases within 30 minutes of picking up her book than I learned after reading and re-reading the Sussman/Smith text multiple times."
4,shipment,"The quality of the product was satisfactory. They fit perfectly, but the shipping rates were way too high... the shipping cost for each product was more than 60% of the cost of the items."
1,Trite and tired,"I like to sample self published books like this in hopes of finding a gem, but this one certainly isn't it. Flat, uninspired prose, tepid characters, tedious storyline, yikes."
4,The Stephen King of his generation,"Reading Columbine, it's hard not to imagine that it was written by Stephen King, himself. Kennedy brings the same passion for plot, the same careful word choice, the same intellectual rigor as King at his best. Kennedy mines a series of comfortably familiar cliches in this masterpiece, examining with Disney-esque rhaposodic lyricism the relationship between two young friends in a coming of age story that screams ""Turn me into a Lifetime Movie of the Week.""Oprah, have you seen this book? It was Oprah Book Club stuff before there was an Oprah Book Club."
1,Was it just my bad luck?,"Even though I was satisfied with the performance of my kenwood CDRom drive (while it worked), it mysteriously died after only one and one-half years of minimal usage.I was a little disappointed that a CDRom that carried the price tag it had would prove unreliable. I still haven't heard back from the company about the possibility of a replacement (approx. 3 months time)."
2,Jeffrey Lyons doesn't get out much.,"The cover of this release boasts a quote from film critic Jeffrey Lyons that ""This restoration is in perfect condition. Orson Welles would have loved seeing it."" Yeah, seeing it burn like a sled. In his tedious and obvious audio commentary (""Note the ominous use of shadow"") Jeffrey raves about how gorgeous the transfer of The Stranger is and how it's the best version he's ever seen. Huh? There are better versions of both films out on VHS, laserdisc and DVD (The Roan Stranger and the Image Trial). The restoration documentary makes it clear that the producers of this set found the (worst) looking prints of these films imaginable to restore. I've seen better ones projected in my college film classes. The only reason to buy this set is to get Hearts of Age, the film shot when Orson was 18."
5,Excellent product,"Fast service, delivered as promised. a perfect compliment to the 18C I already have. If you have not tried one of these center punches you are missing out/"
3,"Goofy, but Entertaining","""Mutant Man"" is a completely ridiculous, over the top horror comedy. The movie beigins in the 50's, as we witness a woman giving birth to a malformed, demonic baby as some crazy blonde woman and two kids(and a dog) look on in eager anticipation. From this odd start, the action moves to the present wherein an extended family of campers break down in the middle of nowhere. Obviously they soon meet up with the title character and his wacky, cannibalistic family.What could have been a completely stupid movie is saved by its own self mocking humor as well as some interesting characters. The Mutant Man clan are possibly the most memorable family of psychos since Leatherface and his kin first buzzed on the scene.Despite the low budget, this is a pretty well made little flick. It doesn't take itself very seriously, yet still manages to deliver some good scares and graphic gore. If you like offbeat horror ""Mutant Man"" might just be your cup of blood."
2,There's a Story Here Somewhere,"There's a great story to be told here, but it isn't. Rex Cauble, a wealthy, larger-than-life Texan is, according to this book, an innocent bystander while a group of his employees and their friends use his resources to smuggle huge amounts of dope. The author believes Cauble to be completely innocent, as we are told many, many times. The entire Cauble saga might have been the subject of great true-crime reporting, but this book reads like four or five drafts of the same magazine article stacked end on end in the hope of proving Cauble's innocence by shear force of repitition."
3,Glad to have the information.. but a rough read,I'd like to believe this book that constantly pounds into you that Rex Cauble was innocent and was framed but the extremely poor writing and editing makes this book a chore to read. I can't blame Graham as much as his publisher but someone should have edited it for numerous grammatical errors and constant repetition. I think Graham wrote everything at least twice.
2,"Incredible Story, Incredibly Bad Edit","It is not often a book makes me angry while reading it. Not angry at the story or the people involved, mind you, but angry at the terrible grammer structure, the inundating repitition, and the awful typesetting. An otherwise great story that deserved better editing, I felt that it was a challenge to read and was very disaapointed by the final result. This book took about 350 pages to say what could have been covered in 200. I understand that Roy Graham is not a professional writer, but shouldn't someone have given this a read through BEFORE it went to the press?"
1,Horrible,Obviously unedited and boring.........uniformative........really wish I had my money back on this one. Understand the family has a book out and states they have their OWN story.
2,"OK Marcoeconomics view, but misses a lot","This book would be good for readers who are interested in macroeconomics and like blaming the Federal Reserve. It would very not be helpful to people who do not follow marcoeconomic debates. Even in this context, it does not provide anything new.For a much better and more interesting take on bubbles, check out Frenzy by Carl Haacke. It's great! It provides compelling insights into how bubbles are created by 3 types of distortions - 1) psychological, 2) competition, 3)excess. Its a much better way to understand bubbles and is a perfect way to view today's real estate bubble. Moreover, it helps explain how to manage them better. For real estate, that would mean (dare I reveal the ending) wait for the crash and buy at firesale prices. But read it to learn more, its worth it."
1,"A lot of fluff, not much substance","For me the best part of this book was Appendix A, entitled ""XML Language Basics"". This should have been the first chapter in the book. But by the time I got to it, I was pretty fed up with reading about ""emergent behavior"" and other buzz phrases. I did get a bit of a sense of what various acronyms mean, such as SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, J2EE and so on, but the ratio of fluff to substance was too high for my taste."
1,"Not for technical people, but for bla bla bla bosses.","I bought this book based on the reviews and I made a mistake.This book doesn't give the technical details I wanted.If you are one of those bosses who doesn't get into details and just want to know the jargon so you can look technical when you are in meetings with more incompetent people, this is your book."
5,An Amazing Collection,"Just amazing -- it's a superb compilation of several similar genres, and more. It's chic, lively, stylish. It puts in so much 'luxury' into the electronic genre.If you're a fan of the wallpaper magazine you'll know what I mean, it's a perfect reflection of and complement to it.Even if you're not into this type of music, but are a open-minded music fan looking to expand your collection, this is a must. It's perfect for both active listening and background tunes."
1,Matt Laughs In The Face Of Declining Popularity Of Disposable Post Grunge,"Like almost all rock bands to have formed within the past 10 years, 3 Doors Down is disposable, all their songs sound dull and boring (their all the same too), they belong in the same category as Creed and Nickelback in the ""Lullaby Rock"" subgenre. It's this kind of stuff, along with emo, Limp Bizkit, and ICP, that is killing rock."
5,2-end,"The lyrics never get stale for them like many other pop rock acts. While maintaining their identity through 3 studio releases, they seem to inject a hint of originality into each new song. The struggles of which Brad sings seem serious and real enough, however, he handles it all with a sense of perspective, making the record a good picker-upper. That is to say, this music puts me in a good mood.The melodies are catchy always, and the lyrics never go over the top with emotion, providing a great balance and believable songs for enjoyable listening. This cd picks up at track #2 and holds me through the end. (The Bob Seger song is so-so). In particular tracks 2-6 are like listening to 5 unique singles, and these songs are one of the best stretches of music you'll ever find."
4,And the music lives on...,"As a 3 Doors Down fan, I find this album one of their most mature as well as entertaining. Landing in London and others just have a continuous flow lyrically and musically that soothes and begs to scream...""Come on guys, what's next!"""
2,and your point is.......,I'm disappointed. I'm bored. Every song leaves me waiting to hear the next one hoping its better.
1,cheesy island,"An embarrassing, exploitive movie. I only bought it because I'm such a Clint Walker fan. He looks great, & I guess he did the best hecould with a crummy part, but it wasn't one of his better career choices.Surprising, because I understand he was usually very pickyabout his projects. This was a bad move."
4,eclipsed by a good scooter,"We bought the plasmacar approximately the same time as a mini kick scooter from kickboard (costs admittedly twice as much). To me, the strange mechanism of theplasmacar was attractive, but for my three-and-a-half year old son, the mini scooter was more attractive, and for my one-and-a-half year old son, it is still much too large. As a play car, it is quite large, and fairly heavy, and it needs much open space in the apartment to move it around in. Also the space needs to be hardwood floor, not carpet. I think is a good thing if you have a large playroom with an assortment of toys for moving around; it is certainly different, but in a normal household with rather limited space, the mini scooter is more fun for the child. The plasmacar is not an outdoor toy."
3,Ok - not great,"My sons saw this at a friend's house and loved using it. However, once we got it - they really haven't been interested at all! When they did ride it to the park, it was kind of difficult for them to continue to work. My children are 3 and 4 1/2 - I would say I wouldn't purchase again at full price. I would look for a used one."
3,"Should be called ""Sierra Middle"" - it doesn't get to the Northern Sierra!","The book & reviews are pretty good (per the other reviewer's comments and my initial look-through), but I was very very disappointed to find out that this book does not really cover any area north of HWY 80 (or actually it just squeeks by with Castle Peak).That means it is missing a *huge* chunk of the northern Sierra Nevada wilderness - Sierra Buttes, Feather River, Gold Lake area, and so on...all the way up to where the Sierra Nevada really ends (up towards Mt. Lassen, depending on which source you read).I'll upload a rear-cover image...take a close look at the red outline showing the area the book covers. If you want to backpack or hike north of HWY 80, get a different book!Cheers,-J"
1,This book is just too much,"I had to read this for class, the amount of information that this book provides is unbelievable.It's hard to read because it mentions too many dates and events, honestly it's like a crowded history book.A lot of history but it's just not well written."
1,Where is Closed-Captioning or English Subtitling?,Length:: 1:36 MinsWhen you see this video and you might rethink to want have me to put English translation of what I am saying. First thing do put captioning or subtitle on its past DVDs or Blu-rays.I do not want to rate this film because it does not carry any closed-captioning or English subtitle.
1,KINGTINUED IS GREAT,I recommend this collection of CD's to all Elvis lovers. The great selection of songs keeps him alive.
2,Deeply disappointed,"I loved Potok's earlier book ""My Name is Asher Lev"" and hoped/assumed that the very moving story would continue into ""The Gift of Asher Lev"". I was disappointed in the read, though. It does not captivate as the first book did. I am not finding fault with the writing; Potok was incredibly gifted with words. It's the story which was a let-down.Asher Lev's artistic and spiritual confusion, aimlessness, and lethargy brought us a dark and mysterious story overall. I felt empathy for the pressure put on Asher by family, the Rebbe, and the community. Mostly, though, from the moment in the story that I guessed what Asher's ""gift"" might be, I really, REALLY hoped I was wrong. But I wasn't wrong, and the revelation left me feeling cold and empty.I truly wish I had not read the book."
5,Valley of the Milk by Michael H. Carroll,"Very good reading, I being a member of the Carroll family, who lives in the States. My grandfather came from the area Michael wrote about in his book."
4,311 = live heaven.,"This is a fairly sweet live album from 311, even if it is a little predictable. Actually I'm glad to see that it's not just a live hits collection, however I do love ""Transistor"" and ""All Mixed Up"". My biggest beef though is where's ""Do You Right""? I mean c'mon. This also, as good as it is, struggles in some spots to re-create their live energy. I'd send the newcomer to the ""Greatest Hits"" disc. Still this is a fan essential with ""Who's Got The Herb"" included. As always, listening to anything from 311 ""Feels So Good""."
1,don't waste your money,"I wish i could return this CD, but because i already opened it and have listened to it... I can't.. I found that only one of these songs has been on the actual tv show! The rest of them are just thrown on there and I don not like this type of music...blah!!!"
5,loved it,"This story was great. It was fast paced, romantic and contained a few surprises. I read it in one sitting. It was so good, that I am going to go back and read the first book in the series: One Magic Moment. To sum it up - ROMANTIC!"
4,Another Testament to Great Reissues,"In this era of homogenized classical collections, it is great to see a label like Testament rescue gems from the vaults of labels like EMI/French Columbia and reissue them on CD. This disc presents Saint-Saens' 3rd Symphony and Faure's Requiem, performed by one of my favorite conductors, the great Andre Cluytens. Cluytens had an immense reputation as an interpreter of French music, and it shows here. The ""Organ"" Symphony, a late mono recording from 1955, is delightful, though clearly a rung below the 1959 Munch/Boston stereo account for RCA. The Requiem, equally wonderful, is also a mono recording, and this 1950 performance is the forerunner to Cluytens' stereo account currently available in the EMI ""Great Recordings of the Century"" series. In all, this disc is yet another ""testament"" to a great reissue program."
4,"Great Art, Good Story",This book had wonderful art. The cover is one of the best batman covers of all time. This is a good detective story as well. The concept though is quite depressing.
1,"""She's a maniac,maniac,and she's dating like she's never dated before""","Jennifer Beals,long after her '80s success in ""Flashdance"" and before breaking out into ""The L Word"", starred in ""Out of Line"" as a parole officer who falls in love with an ex-con named Henri. She's smitten with him, despite the fact he's still entangled with his ol' gang&he; even knocks her out (literally)The plot is needlessly complicated. There's a socialite with a hit on her,an evil gazillionaire,a Hispanic gangsta named Alfonso James who's somehow involved in the whole mess...even the Cigarette-Smoking Man from the X-Files. The truth is out there, indeed. There are plenty of sexual&violent; scenes to compensate for the lack of a coherent plot. Of course, it lacks eroticism and the violence is gratuitous.It's no wonder that Jennifer Beals has since danced away from this flash-in-the-pan movie. The whole movie is out of line... because it's plot makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER."
1,Not what I expected.,Did not like this at all. It was totally not what I wanted. Kept only becauseit would cost more to send it back.
3,fine,"I just bought this because I thought it cute that it was tiny,but it doesn't seen like a confortable guide,and lack color"
2,So disappointed!!!!!1,"I bought this bowl after seing it on The View. It seemed like th""perfect bowl"" and I had was so excited. It was on back order for 3 months and when it finally arrived i was very disappointed! It has NO grip like they say it does. My 15 month old daughter slid it right off of her high chair the first time she used it. It looked like it would be heavy from the pics and the show, and for the price I thought it would be but it is not. On the other hand, I do like the shape. It maked it much easier to scoop without spilling and the spoons work well also. So if you are looking to find a bowl that won't send food flying through the air then this is not the bowl for you. I found a bowl from Target for a quarter of the price of this one and it works way better."
3,Plate okay spoons are great,"If you have a little one who likes to pick up his or her plate and drop it on the floor this plate is not for you. The plate can be easily picked up. Plus the plate is too large and fits awkwardly on our highchair (we have a boon high chair that we love love!) I do however, really like the spoons. My son has more success and less mess with these spoons more than any other kind...for one thing the spoon bowl is quite rounded (compared to some spoons that are only slightly rounded or even flat) which is helpful as the child raises the spoon to the mouth the spoon may be tipped this way or that and the rounded bowl of the spoon helps to keep the contents on the spoon instead of falling back onto the plate. Plus the shape of spoon handle and texture of the materials makes the spoon easier to grasp."
1,not pleased,"this product cost $[...] and I was very disapointed with it. It has not suction, which I thought that it would and whenever the baby drops it off his high chair (which is often) the white middle pops out of the base. I thought it would be a heavier material so that he couldn't flip it off his tray so easily. Not worth $[...] that is for sure. Should have just gotten a suction plastic bowl at K-mart for 4 or 5 bucks."
2,A big disappointmet,"After hearing all the good news about these plates, I decided to dish out the money for them. Instead of being thrilled, I have become more and more disappointed with them. My son picked them up and threw them on the floor. They now have cracks down the middle of them. They are way too easy to crack. However, the spoons are wonderful. I wish they sold the spoons separately."
4,"great, cute, but a little big","This bowl is cute and difficult for my daughter to lift and throw. However, if your high chair has a smaller tray, this bowl will not fit. For example, we have theFisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat - Blue, and the bowl does not fit on the tray - it is too large for the tray."
5,Second child loves it too!,"We had this for my son and 2 years later are passing it down to my daughter. She loves it just as much as he did. It does sit well on the tray and we have had great luck in keeping it there. The spoons are well designed so more goes into the mouth and less into the lap. The colors are great, it is dishwasher safe, and most importantly, my kids love it. The contoured sides make it easier for them to get the food on the spoon without pushing it out of the dish. I loved every Bjorn item we have and this is no exception."
3,Dance-club sensibilities and a nugget of Native spirit.,"Star People provides a mix of danceable pop and more reflective numbers. Anyone looking for Native American chants or lonely flutes played on windswept buffalo plains should look elsewhere. Brule is unapologetically modern in its execution, and the result is more ""white middle-class"" than Lakota. But the root is there -- primarily evident through aspects of the flute, percussion and subtle, chant-like vocals -- and it adds a pleasant, ethnic touch to the overall sound."
2,Bulky and defective,"If it weren't for the brick you have to strap to your arm, this would be an okay watch. The a few of the cells on the LCD display stopped working and it makes it very difficult to read."
3,"Interesting, but a bit on the fluffy side","I'm the kind of reader that enjoys straight to the point books. As interesting as this book was, I found it rambled and went too deep into how to sell IA to administration, or learn about IA in schools, or what steps should one take to become an information architect, etc. I found it presented ideas, often left the reader at the end of each section with ""it depends"" or ""you'll see what works best for you"". Which is fine, but isn't really helpful.About 100 pages too long, this book should have been boiled down significantly, and cut out all the chapters about promotion of the IA field. The title of the book is ""Designing large-scale web sites"" not convincing your boss to invest in IA.Ok, but not worth the money."
1,where's the main song????,"i saw the movie, then i decided to buy the soundtrack, cause i really liked the song that charley sings for eban when they're back from the beach,( after u've seen the movie that song reveals to be the most important of them all ), so i got the cd i listened to it and when it was over i was still waiting for that song. now, tell me what kind of soundtrack is a soundtrack that doesn't even include the main song?? the rest of the music isn't even that good actually it's everything but good, this is just a waste of money and time so **** it"
4,I have the green version of these and they seem to do ok,"These seem to work better than the competing brand 'tire flies' ( i believe that's how the competitive brand is spelled). Anyway, from my experience tire flies are notorious for working inconsistently-you would buy a set of two and one of them usually doesn't work so you'd have to buy two sets. Then after a week or two, one of the lights doesn't work. And tire flies aren't that bright.This brand seems to be a bit brighter and so far they have worked pretty consistently. The only issue i have with them is that they are always on when you ride - day or night. i wish there was a way to have them turn off when i'm riding during the day so as to not waste the battery.I use green tiresparx with the following for my night rides:Down Low Glow Lighting Kit - Two Tubes-Envy(green)Planet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket MountPlanet Bike Blinky Super Flash 1/2-Watt Blaze LED Plus 2 eXtreme LED Rear Bicycle Light"
4,Great book - but Rod's own framework?,"This is a great book - by far the best J2EE design book I have read to date. Approximately the first half of the book contains not just the HOW, but the WHY of J2EE design - this is exactly what I was after, and this book certainly provides it.My only (somewhat minor) dissapoinment with the book was the fact that a lot of the examples were not built around existing frameworks, but were based around Rod's own frameworks. For example, instead of using Struts, Rod uses his own MVC web framework. Even though Rod's frameworks are probably *better* than some that are out there - it would have been nice to read ""portable"" examples that can be plugged into existing frameworks.Having said that, I still think the book is an excellent buy, and a must for any serious J2EE developer/designer/architect that wants to understand WHY you should architect your J2EE system in a particular way - not just HOW."
3,Could be better,"This tea is ok, but lacks the vanilla ooomph of other brands of Rooibos vanilla. Starbucks version is the best out there IMHO."
4,"Nice fragrance, killer bottle","This is a nice, fairly light scent that will appeal to a lot of younger women and even older ones. The bottle is beautiful and will look fabulous on your dressing table."
3,"It Worked Well, But...","We have an older dog (14 years) and he has just this year started peeing in our house. He only does it at night and usually only in the hallway upstairs. After keeping him in a room overnight, barricaded in the kitchen overnight, and other attempts at keeping him from upstairs, we ordered this. It worked really well for the first few nights. However, once he got used to it and started peeing in it, his fur was moist and smelly from being in the diaper. It also ""leaked"" onto our bedspread. We've stopped using it."
1,"too small, doesnt stay on",Got the XSmall (which says 4-8 pounds)for a 5 pound chihuahua. It dosent fit. It is too small. It slides right off. You cant even duct tape it to a sweater to get it to stay up like u can with a disposable bc it is too heavy.
3,Prefer Developing Capable People,"I would highly recommend: Positive Discipline for Teenagers: Empowering Your Teens and Yourself Through Kind and Firm Parenting by Ed.D. Jane Nelsen (Author), Lynn Lott (Author) ISBN 076152181X before this book. (Or any other in the Positive Discipline / Developing Capable People Series by Jane Nelson and H. Stephen Glenn)"
2,"Such an interesting topic,such a BORING book!","not a bad book,and historically accurate,but it really doesnt tell us many details about this infamous club.very repetetive ""they had orgies,they drank a lot"" etc, etc..ad naueseum.i was really disappointed by the lack of insight into the minds of these people.this may have been considered a wild book when it came out in 1959 but it seems timid today"
5,Encouraging reading!,"I have read the Canon of St. Andrew several times in the past. This book is helpful in causing a deeper dig within my own heart, to grasp the faith of the Ancient Christians! I expect that this book will begin to look worn, as the years go by, as well as a few other favorites on my bookshelf!"
2,Almost useless,I did not like this book. It gives only very basic information on how the spine works; the exercises are not properly described and exercise drawbacks are not pointed out. There is a section about nutrition that does not tell you anything really useful.You might consider buying it only if you are a real novice to this matter.
5,His Best Yet!!!,"I have read all of the Nathaniel Drinkwater novels penned by this author and this one seemed the most authentic, which is high praise because the others were outstanding.As Napolean tries to increase his world domination, Drinkwater finds himself involved in the blockade of the French/Spanish fleet, eventually taken prisoner and on one of the enemy ships during the epic battle of Trafalger.I'm not going to spend a lot of time extolling this authors virtues, except to say they are legend and apparant. This is his best yet."
1,This ain't it....,"I wanted this album for the Untouchables and Naked City and I can tell you without reservation that these are NOT original themes.Knock offs maybe for someone desperate, but not the TV shows original themes. Give a listen to the sampler, then decide."
5,Recommended Reading for Ghost Story Lovers!,"The Ghost Next Door is a great little book to curl up with in your favorite chair on a spooky night. It really pulls you in with the author's commentary and stories that are told from the first-person perspective. I found it refreshing, since all of the stories are new, and have never been told before. It really makes you wonder if there are any ghosts around you as you're reading it!"
1,Average,"I've heard these types of stories around tables a hundred times over. The storeis were brief, not investigated thoroughly and was not engrossing in the least."
3,Whirligig-One of those books,"Whirligig is one of those books that is a interesting, unique story in a confusing content. I would definately reccommend this book, to a good reader!"
2,Whirligig,"The book Whirligig is a book I didn't like. One of the reasons I didn't like is that the book wasn't very interesting. two other reasons are that the book was confusing and had too many big words.In the book a boy named Brent goes to a party to try to get closer to a girl he likes.As he's at the party he gets drunk. When he tries to hit on the girl he likes she blows him off. Brent then gets mad tries to hit the host of the party and leaves. On the way home he thinks about his life and decides that he's going to crash and commit suicide, but he is unsuccessful and kills a girl named Lea in the process. Lea's mother's only request is that Brent goes to the four corners of the country and put whirligigs there.I would recommend this book to people who can follow a book closely and that can read big words."
4,Great Book,"Whirligig is a very good book for teenagers who feel or have felt lost and alone. Brent Bishop, the main character in this book, makes a fatal mistake and winds up in the four corners of the United States building whirligigs. After you get into the book and figure out what's going on it makes pretty easy reading. The only hard part is the beginning of just about every chapter. It switches you to a new place and it takes about three pages to figure out where you're at. This book has a very good plot and it makes very interesting reading. It's cool to watch how the character changes throughout this book. I would recommend it for anyone."
3,Whirligig,"Whirligig by Paul Fleischman is a great book. It is about a boy named Brent who likes a girl named Brianna. Brianna gets annoyed with Brent and told him to go away and stop following her around. He go really mad at her comment and left to get in his car and get in a crash to kill himself. Instead of ending his own life he ends up killing an innocent girl his age named Lea. Brent goes to go meet with Leas mom to see what he can do to have her forgive him. Her request was to have Brent put four whirligigs around the United States, one in each of the corners. Ofcourse hes up for the challenge. I think this book was a good way to tell people that doing one thing to hurt yourself could also hurt someone else. And doing something good for someone can change who you are."
3,Ok book,"I gave this book 3 stars. One thing I didn't like about this book was that a street cleaner ran over a girl. What I lik adout this book was that the girl's mom didn't make the guy go to jail, she made him make the guy make 4 whirligigs and put them in the 4 coners of the United states and those states are Washington, Californi, Florida, and Maine. On the whirligigs he had to make them look like the girl Lea."
2,"Beware, might not be for you.","""The Pitstop Repair Kit will repair chipped or cracked, up to 6"", windshields permanently with a resin that is 5 times stronger than the windshield itself.""This is false. I have a 4"" star crack and this does not work. If you have something about half an inch, then maybe this is for you. But 6"" is false advertisement. Don't buy!"
2,Not All it's Chipped Up To Be,"I had a small chip in my windshield, right in my sight-line, so I thought I'd use a Pit-Stop kit to ""make it disappear."" Followed the directions to the letter; it's not nearly as easy as they make it look on TV.1. The resin does not cure as quickly as it should.2. The chip is somewhat less annoying, but did not disappear.3. The O-ring and pedestal that stick to the windshield, are extremely difficult to remove, even with a new razor blade. I only wish the resin adhered as well.Overall, I'm disappointed with this product, and would not recommend it, as it does not live up to the hype."
1,DO NOT BUY - TOTAL WASTE OF MANY!!!!!!!!!,"I was super excited awaiting this book because I read some good reviews on here. Once I received the book- it looked very flimsy and more like a brochure - nonetheless, I set out on my quest for the ""best"" doctor from this book. I visited a total of 4 doctors all of which the book suggested. I can't even begin to tell you what horrible choices all 4 were. One doctor was in a mad dash to get me to commit. Another was so unbelievably old his office was extremely dusty. Another didn't take the time - seemed preoccupied and lastly when I went into the other's office while I was in the waiting room - a woman came in complaining about the bad job he had done on her - needless to say I excused myself on out of there. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!! This author should be looked into for writing and marketing false adverting. Steer clear!!! don't waste your time or many!!!!!!!!"
5,"For everyone who has ever wondered ""what's it like""","If you've ever watched an air show routine performed by fighthers you have probably wondered""how do you get from here to there""The answere lies in Gandt's book. I was amazed to learn the rigors of fighter pilot training and I am admittedly more than a little envious of those who had the opportunity. Captain Gandt writes credibly and well from a vantage point that few can offer. He relates the entire experience, even the social and political aspects of nugget life that are a part of every career but often understated. Photographs are included which give faces to these real people."
5,SWEET BOOK,"As an aspiring Navy aviator and hopefully astronaut one day, this book has given me a great inside look at the world of Naval Aviation. Gandt shows it as it is; for all it's glory and includes the shortcomings. Overall this was a kick ass book. If anyone wants to contact me about their experiences as a pilot or something please do."
4,"Sure would like ""a reader, 7/1/97"" to fill in the gaps.","OK ""reader"". You make serious allegations to Gandt's lack of research and his own own Navy background yet you choose to remain anonimous. What kind of fighter pilot were you?"
4,Best Teacher Guide on Flight Ive Seen,This book made flight really fun and easy to understand for my kids. I use the whole series every year for science. Lots of enrichment for smart kids too.
1,Poor fit!,My son has tried and tried to use this but he slides forward on the seat and it makes it almost impossible for him to use... It is cute and would be fun if the fit was better!
1,Broken,"not the best cube to display a football , not easy to get apart and center football.I recommend buying something made better.The one I bought in the mail was also cracked"
5,The most spectacular singing of all time,"his if the single most impressive collection of the most taxing coloratura singing ever compiled in aset of two DVDs. These are recordings of the great Dame from 1960-1968. This is the periodwhen she reigned supreme - easily surpassing the efforts of Callas, Caballe, Sills and every otherbel canto diva.The singing has to be heard to be believe. I personally consider this collection to surpass even hermost popular cds including ""The art of the Prima Donna"". And as a bonus you can watch it as wellas listen to it.I've already bought several sets of these as gifts and for future use. I believe that when you watchthese dvds you will immediately be convince that you are watching the greatest display of bravurasinging to ever graced a stage - past, present, and future. Bravissima!"
3,it's ok,"They don't make these like they used to. These videos used to be 45 minutes of pure goodness about your team. Now they are made for television, and only about 20-25 min. long. But, it's the best you can do."
1,Whole-Language by any other name is still Whole-Language,"A frightening look into the way children who can't teach themselves to read by being exposed to print, in the whole-language classroom, are remediated.With this method it is claimed you don't even have to know letters or their associated sounds to be able to read.Whole-Language was a horrible failure in California and its continuing implementation is likely to condem thousands of our children to marginal reading skills, if not total illiteracy."
1,Not Buying Any of It!!!,"IN MY OPINION, how convenient for the lawyer in this case to be able to come to an internet site and delete her comments! Luckily for the attorney, she had the 20/20 hindsight to delete her comments AFTER a suit was filed and AFTER a book was published. Kettle, meet black.I did read the lawsuit and am amazed at how irrelevant so many the allegations are to the case. It appears to me that both the suit and the book are complicit in one goal only....to incite a dedicated fan base to want to know everything there is to know about Clay Aiken; to create hype where there is none. This is one fan who is not falling for it. Again, I'm just stating my opinion. This is my husband's and my account, but I'll post my name to it Joan Price Williamson, just in case anyone wants to sue me for stating an opinion and a recommendation not to buy."
1,Out of the Blue,"I met this woman a year ago and she was bragging about her book then. I think she is trying to cash in on a celebrity and is very tacky for doing so. I think to buy her book is only to encourage her ""low life"" behavior."
1,Out of the Blue Clay It Forward,"This book is a real snooze fest. Obviously the writer is scratching the bottom of the barrel to come up with information regarding this celebrity. It's very uninformative and plain boring.If your interested in Clay Aiken the person, you'll not learn anything in this book."
1,a theory why Clay fans did not buy this book....,"Clay fans historically do not spend money on stories about Clay fans. We can get that for free. To imply that fans were instructed not to buy this is specious - how have other books about Clay sold? Surely the author did not believe this book was another Learning To Sing?Clay fans can also get more information than they need about Clay right on the internet. So again, why buy a book?I did read a bit of the book. Found no reason to buy it.The author evidently thought this book was a slam-dunk for sales to Clay fans, and there is no data to support this. None of the other books written about Clay have done very well - because this is the internet age. We can easily find anything that may be in a book, on our own. This is a vanity publication, with vanity publication sales. And Clay has never endorsed any other book about him; why should he do so now?"
2,Nothing New Here...,"I happen to be a fan of Robert Kiyosaki, so when I saw the title of this book, I didn't hesitate to pick it up (actually I purchased the audio CDs). Unfortunately, I should have waited. It happens to be a rehashed version of Rich Dad, Poor Dad and the Cashflow Quadrant. Since I already own both of those titles, I didn't feel that I received any added value for my money. Also he spends most of the time telling stories about his own life, instead of providing valuable tips on what to do and/or what steps to take before you quit your job. If you have not read any of Kiyosaki's other books, then by all means pick it up, but if you have any of his other titles, you should just skip this one."
3,Mediocre book,"Well, I've read [or listened to] a lot of the Rich Dad series and this is one that I'm not really impressed with. 75% of the relevant information is simply repeated from earlier books that Robert made. However - it's a good book & would be worth reading for anyone who has entrepreneurial goals. Since it's not great, nor bad, I'll give it 3 stars."
5,Powerful book!!!,"If you ever wanted to know what it's like to start your business the right way, but were afraid to ask...read this book along with the ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad,"" series."
3,Entertaining Dig at Religion,"I enjoyed this amusing little science fiction novel because I am always up for a little religious satire. Heinlein elaborates on the biblical story of Job, presenting Christian mythology as an eternal bureaucracy. I didn't find the book particularly memorable, but it was fun while it lasted."
5,A great though often overlooked Heinlein novel,"This is mind bending novel by a real master of the science fiction genre. It is one of the many memorable books that late Robert Heinlein has written. It's a favorite of mine because it is the first Heinlein novel I ever read. I quickly followed it up with ""Starnger in a Strange Land,"" ""The Fourth Estate"" and ""To Sail Beyond the Sunset."" A truly excellent read...and I read very little sci-fi until I came across ""Job..."""
5,The Truth is Hard to Accept,"This story reflects my life.I am challenged, and so is my faith.And I am not the first.This tale makes me smile and focuses my priorities."
5,Complicated story told superbly!,"This story spanned a very long time. Ms. Davis did an excellent job bringing all the characters into focus and blending them showing how they grew up and how there paths crossed. And best of all she helps us understand mind control and how some women really can not extracate themselves from a monster like Cummings. A wonderful book for especially abused women to read; women who find themselves caught in situations they think there is no way out of; and a really good book for folks who critize such women and just can't understand why they don't just leave. Read the book and boy, you'll understand why some women feel they are trapped for life. Very very well written, cohesive and educational. You won't be disappointed."
5,An Informative and Entertaining Book for Catholic Youth,"Ms. Welborn has written a concise, but thorough book for Catholic teens on how to defend their faith when accosted by well-meaning Fundamentalists and Evangelicals of their perceived oddities of the Catholic faith. It is written in a humorous vein that will be especially appealing to young people (as well as adults). Could be successfully used in a class setting for youth with 16 reasonably length chapters that should keep them attentive. It is written for Catholic youths. It is not mean-spirited towards non-Catholics, but by the same token, Ms. Welborn does not sugar-coat the apparent conflict of beliefs between entities. If you are in charge of a Catholic Youth Ministry, I highly recommend you peruse a copy of this book."
2,La traviata.,"What's this? This is a mistake Sills made. If you want to hear an impeccable ""E strano and Sempre libera"" go to Magda Olivero and listen how this aria should be sung."
1,Picture tube blow out,I got it for my sister for her birthday in june... she use it everyday since july and now in august its dead. The picture tube just blew out for no reason. VERY UPSET. Buyers Beware.
2,Miss leading sdvertizement,The add said seisse of Switzerland designing only the very best in water filtration and purifcation products nothing about being made in Thailand miss leading. they sent me an add for $ 18.54 but I paid $24.21. You tell me I don't know
1,Unpleasant surprise,"I am a collector of soundtracks and, even though I do not play DAOC, I purchased this one based on the sample clips presented. If you are thinking of buying this, be aware that the clips above are not indicative of the album. In fact, only four, very short pieces on this album are even part of the game soundtrack. The rest are a mishmash of pieces from various other sources. The two from Secret Garden are lifted from their ""Dreamcatcher"" album. As has been mentioned, there is no real flow to the music. Most jarring are the numerous choral arrangements, which I did not expect and don't particularly enjoy.If you're thinking of starting DAOC like I was and hope to get a feel for the game by listening to the soundtrack, don't waste your time. I'll most likely be selling this one."
2,Not so good.,"INSTEAD OF SHOWING SOME OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE TO AMERICA,THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CHINA TO INTERVIEW CHINESE MASTERS.THERE ARE PLENTY OF STYLES IN CHINA THAT THEY CAN SHOW BUT NOT.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DVD.YOU WON'T FIND SO MUCH INFORMATION (EXCEPT IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING OF MARTIAL ARTS)"
1,Customer service is terrible,"For each of the last three days, I've spent half an hour trying to reach Belkin UK Customer services. A UPS I bought simply does not work, and I'd like one that does.And the phone just keeps on ringing... but no answer."
2,Eew!,"I have been a big historical fiction fan for a long time but this book almost turned me away from it. I only gave it two stars because I did enjoy the historical aspect. I learned a lotabout the Cathars and their long-forgotten customs but this book was just too bad for anything more. The ending was some weird ""is she or isn't she"" torture/death scene that just threw me way out of the loop. There are many better examples of great historical fiction but this book was just weird."
3,Disappointing,"Treasure of MontsegurI really, really wanted to like this book, and was disappointed.The story of the Cathars and the treasure is fascinating (my interest was piqued by a visit to this region of France some years ago).However, I thought the telling of this melodramatic fictionalisation was pedestrian and a little laboured. It was a bit Harlequin-romance dressed up as something more.Nevertheless, a plaeasant and undemanding read if you are looking for somethign with an historical basis, and a topic not covered elsewhere in popular fiiction."
3,Fun adult adventure,"Definatly a show with tons of fanservice. Adult content throughout. It's a series of independant stories where a college kid gets odd jobs and manages to get caught in embarrassing situations or looking like an idiot. The last episode is the best, it ties all the previous adventures together. A little shallow, a little perverted, but good hearted and fun to watch!"
3,way to small,I order this for my cousin who is thin... skinny thin.. and the medium was way too short and tight for him. I suggest going one or two sizes up. It was a great gag gift!
2,Unsure,"The cure taste is too strong. The instructions they have can't be correct.I've only tried it with cut meat, no ground. I let it marinade for about a day and a half.Next time I'm either going to wash the marinade before I dry it or use ground beef and a jerky gun.The flavor is alright but definitely not better than something almost anyone could make themselves."
1,rehash,"in the 5 star review, the write states this and the preceeding book...if so why are all the raitings for the previous book only 2 stars or less...all stating a rehash of information that has been around for years and is available anywhere? I have purchased bottomline products in the past and I agree, waste of money! Beware of infomercial!"
1,Oil for the smoke shorted the train and the wheels broke within a few months,This train is not well made. It ran fine until we put the oil in and then it was all choppy like the oil was shorting something out under the hood. After a few months the wheels on one side got out of whack - the push rod went up when it should have been down. Could manually fix it but after several times the plastic fake piston on the front broke off too. It could be glued - but you get the picture.
4,Quality Product,"This is a good piece of audio equipment. The connection mechanism has been improved over older models and the impedance compensating function is also an upgrade.However, be careful as to the manual. As hard as this is to believe, my unit had instructions for a prior generation of this product. The instructions for the connecting device have you pull the connector out of the back of the switch. If you're successful, you will have rendered the switch inoperable.Otherwise, good unit."
1,"Not in my home, not for my children!","We were unhappily surprised to learn about this book when a well-meaning relative gave it to our 9 year old son for Christmas. The book jacket gave no indication of the rough content. Presumably, the teleportation angle looked appealing to the purchaser.Fortunately, our son became disturbed by the language in the book, and stopped reading before he got to the homosexual rape in the first few pages. When we took a closer look at the sexual content and the foul language, we took the book from his possession. I am appalled that this book would be sold... for youngsters. The violence and sexual content are offensive and the constant stream of foul language is vulgar and disrespectful.I cannot imagine any circumstance in which we would accept this book into our home, no matter what age our children have attained. There are better sources of inspiration to help us overcome hardship in life which don't require disrespecting fathers, young readers or God."
4,A suspenseful page turner!,"I originally bought ""Jumper"" because I was given ""Reflex"" (sequel) by a friend, so I thought I'd read the first one.I had seen the movie previews but didn't really know what to expect from the storyline. It was a lot better than I thought. It is basically about a boy that learns that he can teleport anywhere in the world. The story centres around his childhood, living with an alcoholic abusive father, and then as he arouses the attention of the NSA, the running from them and at the same time trying to track down a terrorist that killed one of his family.The book deals with a few strong issues, abuse, alcoholism, and terrorism, and yet is action packed and definitely a page turner. I really enjoyed this one. Its more action than science fiction, but I still found it a good read and I'm looking forward to ""Reflex""."
4,Leaps and bounds ahead of the film.,"After being left completely disappointed from another too-quick book-to-film adaptation, I decided to check out the original creation. As usual, they book and the film have very little in common, despite a common theme of transportation. Steven Gould did a very good job gripping and maintaining my attention through this whole book. So, I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a good Sci-Fi read or just left the theater bewildered looking for an answer."
5,To any reader,The best book I ever read once I started I couldn't put it down and after I finished it I wished it would keep on going. So I recommend this book to anyone. It is definatly worth its while.
4,Interesting Scenario,"I viewed the movie and thought it was excellent, so I took the plunge and bought the book. Wow, the book has most of the same characters, but includes alot more scenes. The book I feel leaves a giant plothole as it never really explains how Davie got his teleporting ability. Other then that, the book is definetly worth a once over![My book[ASIN:1432719297 Enemies Among Us]"
3,pocket version,"good book, the quality that i got it was horrible the seller neglected to mention the binding was falling apart :) but everything else great book beware of private sellers for that reason."
1,it's a crock,"if you're gonna make money, then you're gonna make money. this book is not a magic elixer to become rich"
5,Homerun!,Kiyosaki gives you his view of the power and the real values of Network Marketing as a completely new way to achieve wealth. Life changing!
3,Unbiased Opinion?,"To the unknowing, Kiyosaki has an unbiased opinion of network marketing. Don't be fooled. He is a major speaker for many network marketing training organizations for companies such as Amway and Quixtar, among others. He has a great interest in promoting network marketing because these companies use his books to promote their own very highly profitable training systems. Get the ""other side of the story"" before diving into network marketing headfirst. Explore many companies. Make sure they don't profit off of your training. Good Luck!"
5,Good EP,"Breaking Benjamin is one of my favorite bands in the world! So when i heard about this cd, i just had to get it. Here's my review:1. So Cold Aucoustic-10/10-i liked it on WANA, I still like it now.2. Blow Me Away-5/5-On the Halo 2 video game, it's better than ""ladybug""3. Ladybug-1/5-A PUNK SONG ATEMT!!!!!!!!!!!!? Avril tried that, and thank god her fans (for some bizzare reason) like her.4. Away (Live)-10/5-MY FAVE.!!! (On WANA + SC EP)5. Breakdown (Live)-5/5-WICKED"
2,5 songs....2 are good.....so 2 stars,The first two songs are great. The third sounds like no B.B. song I've every heard before....punkish. The last two are live and the vocals are bad.
2,"This one's for the die-hards, thrill-seekers only",Just for curious minds. You can sample 'it' online even. Nahhh. Buy the album instead.
5,happy customer,I was more than pleased with this product. I received it very quickly and it was in excellent condition.
2,Broken out of box,"Seems like a nice little alarm clock - small, not too bright so it doesn't keep me awake at night, but yet the display is easy to read. Simple to use. But the alarm on/off switch is permanently on. So there is no way to turn off the alarm."
3,fabric is flimsy,"Fabric is very thin and flimsy, so for durability I say I don't like it. However the frame is nice so if you like to sew, I would suggest sewing a whole copy of what they made, only with sturdier fabric, and keep the nice frame because that plus the wheels and all, seem to be holding up quite nicely since my 7 yr old was being kind of *ahem* and sat in it and contributed to it's ripping and tearing all over. The ends are simply slipped onto the metal frame so they slip off far too easily. I sewed them up around the hinges and the tops broke a few times, had to sew that up, too. I stick a needle in, and pull a bit on the fabric and it makes a big hole, that's how weak and flimsy this fabric is."
1,Terrible Stroller,I bought the stroller for my niece and she went to sit her baby doll in it and it broke!! She didn't even get to use it once!!
4,Predictable but good to see Stefanie Powers again,"Being a Stefanie Powers fan, I enjoyed this movie. There were predictable bits, of course, but still worth viewing. Stef never seems to get old, does she!"
5,go ahead..,go ahead and lay it on thick - this brush holds a serious load of sauce without dripping and makes uniform application easy
5,Easy Installation,"This was a good buy. The mandrels on my 46"" Craftsman deck went out and needed replacing. I went to the Sears PartsDirect website and found they wanted $71.00 a piece for them. I found these for just under $20.00 each. I ordered and replaced all three. Installation was a snap and my mower deck just got a new lease on life. These are Oregon replacement parts. I found that Oregon makes many of the parts that are used in Craftsman power tools, such as chain saws.As a side note, I ordered the three self tapping screws extra because I snapped off the old ones when I was taking the old manderels off. The description didn't have them listed as being included. When I opened the mandrel box the screws came with it. Not only that, but the mandrels are already threaded making installation easier."
5,Great correction pen,"Wite Out Correction Shake n Sqeeze Pen - 6 PiecesThis is a great product; I have used them for some time, and I really like this particular brand and product. In addition to correcting mistakes, I use them to write device names on power cords, USB cables, transformers, and much more. The lettering stays put, expecially on items that are not handled much. Great product!"
4,Frog Prince,I hate it when books leave you in suspense of what it left to happen. This book is a perfect example of what should be done to books. It gives you an update of what happens from the frog becomes a prince. I found it to be very good.
3,The Prince and the Princess lived happily ever after as frog,"The Frog Prince and Princess were not getting along. The Princess said, ""Why don't you turn back in to a frog. So the Prince ran out of the castle and tried to find a witch that would turn him into a frog, but there was no witch that had the right spell. Finally the Prince found a fairy godmother and she turned him into a carriage. At midnight the spell broke and the prince ran home. Both the Prince and Princess kissed and both of them turned into frogs and they lived happily ever after."
2,Mere anecdotes prove nothing.,"This book is about 15 pages of useful exercises and 295 pages of anecdotes involving real world heroes who ask for what they want and then receive it. This book would have made a helpful pamphlet for someone just embarking into the world of self-help literature but alas, it's a book. I threw in an extra star for the relationship advice, though. There's nothing really novel about it, but it's good advice."
2,Expected more,"I've been reading Jack canfield's Success Principles and loving it. Decided to check this out since it was mentioned in his book, but found it not only boring but useless. There's not much substance here. I listened to the tapes because I had already spent the money, but would not reccomend them to anyone. Get Success Principles instead, you won't regret it!"
5,Very Nice!,"It took me a few listens before I felt comfortable with this album but I must say this is probably at the same level as dr. octagon. Maybe not better, more like two steps to the right. I do feel its a little short and the music videos are really low-budget and kinda dumb but if you like keith you should dig them as well. Not his best but I cant think of any other rap album released around this time that i can actually play and listen to, other than project polariod. 5 STARS! Over N Out-"
1,NEVER RECEIVED,"Never received this item. Seller sent me a letter to refund and let me keep it if it arrives, never got it."
3,Unnecesary accessory.,"It does what it says, but after using I don't know why you need it. A guitar only has six strings. Using your fingers is not that hard once every couple of months."
4,Good Solid Information,"I needed this book for a training course on Windows development in .Net. It helped a great deal to have a good reference that was not the same as the book used in the course. Sometimes I found the examples a little hard to follow because of the distraction of the scenarios shown, but when I boiled them down to what they were meant to present, they were very helpful."
2,Sharp SPC033 runs fast,"The Sharp SPC003(D) digital alarm clock has a big, bright, and clear display. However, the clock gains about 1 minute or more every 24 hours or so. I have to reset it every couple of days. It is very annoying. I would not recommend this product."
4,Game Player' Must,This game is so much fun to play. (I have only played Chicken Foot so far) A MUST-HAVE for avid game players.
3,Great with the sound turned off...,The photography in the video as absolutely awesome. I could have used a lot less (like none of) Michael Wood oohing and awwwing about more or less superficial aspects of Indian history. I am already awed.
3,Interesting,The first episode is an overview of the different ethnicity and civilizations that have called the Indian subcontinent home. I found the narrator to be slightly annoying but the subject matter was interesting.
2,the story of India,"I did not like at all, I though that I would be able to see India, but just history e too much talking, the video shows old picture of India,I was totally disapointed, sorry, it was a bad dvd."
1,I returned mine,"This is, as the other reviewers stated, 18/8 flatware and not 18/10 as advertised. Far worse than that, the butter knives are hollow, which gives them a very cheap and flimsy feel."
5,Best Toy EVER!!,My son got this for X-mas and has played on it every day for the last 5 months. He loves the toys [esp. Pinapple Man!] and I love that the mat is washable and comes with its own net bag for the laundry. It's very easy to fold up and take on vacation with you and is made well.
3,Imperfectly entertaining,"When the main plot gets going it grabs you in its vise-like jaws and won't let go, but there is way too much extraneo"
3,a bit slow,"I must admit that I find King's earlier work to be a little slow and word-cluttered. The idea and the intent were there, but it's not one of King's better works."
3,pretty good,I am really confused on how muched I liked the book. It was fun reading about the dogs chewing peoples throats open but it was really hard for me to read for more than ten minutes because it had really long boring parts and some parts drug on. But all in all I thought it was cool and I'm glad I read it.
2,Poorly Scanned Kindle Edition,The content of the book is terrific ... having read a hard copy years ago I know this. Unfortunately this Kindle version was poorly scanned and not properly edited for scanning errors. I have only read the first few chapters and it is hard to follow at times with the errors. Hopefully the publisher will correct these problems soon and let us know.
3,typos a plenty,too many typos in the kindle version and i must admit i felt little for these characters. the ending is way better than the movie. worth reading.
4,Cujo,"Typical Early King, less (but not insufficient) character build up and more of both, suspense and action. I have to say it is the suspense that increases the most and therfore carries the book while the 'sitting on the edge of your seat' action is not quite there. I didn't feel the goosebumps or even the outright fear I have felt in several of his other books. Le Guepe(Dan Newell)"
4,Cujo Book Review,"I am a student attending Mountain View High School, and for a project we had to read a book and give a presentation on it. I read Cujo and I thought it was very scary and climaxful. Then entry of the book I thought was good, then it gave you all the good settings that books usually do and after that it was like climax city. The last half of the book always kept you on your seat always wanting to know what was going on with each character and how they would react to what happened. I would definetly say it was a good book and I would recommend it to many people. One thing that some people might not like is the amount of profanity and the details of sexual relations, but I have no problem with that and I enjoyed the book"
4,"Nothings perfect, and this book is no exception","Cujo is a very enjoyable read. It is exciting and intense, and won't let you stop reading. It was not too terrifying, though, which may be good for some people and bad for hard-core scary story fans. Unfortunately, Cujo does have its flaws. For instance, I can see why this book is challenged and even banned in some places. When people die in this book, it explains the gory details all too much. Also, there is a lot of bad language and other stuff inappropriate for kids. The book itself wasn't perfect, either. Some of the main characters were un-likable and the settings didn't change much, which got kind of annoying. Suprisingly little happened for the length of the book, which is something I find fascinating, because King makes it sound like more is happening than really is. However, I am not saying this book is bad. It is a good book, but you should just take into consideration your age and interests."
4,GREAT!!!,"I don't understand all the people who thought that this book was boring or not enough action. Guess what, not every book has to be filled with complete action and not have one or two boring parts. Well, when I read this book I thought it was great! It wasn't his best but it was still very good. The ending was very exciting and good. The begging was good too. The middle could of used some work, but other than that I loved it!"
5,Poor puppy,"Cujo was one of the first novels I had read by Stephen King. I remember feeling appreciation for his writer's ability to take a rather discreditable situation and turn it into a survival horror story, one of endurance by a desperate mother."
3,could of been better,"All in all this was a descent read with an exciting main plot, yet were all the little side stories necessary? I was getting pretty sick of those slowing down the story. For those who have read this; what the hell did the ""monster in the closet"" have anything to do with the plot? I did like it when King had cujo's point of veiw. This could have been a 4 star novel if the little detour stories were cut and if cujo was let loose on the nearby town and killed a lot more people."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THEY USE TO BE,"I remember when buying the Sports Illustarted Swimsuit calendar was the highlight of my entire year. That in itself might be a sad commentary, but aside from that and in all honesty, the calendars have slowly slided toward mediocracy."
5,Love this book,I found this book very helpful. It had lots of great examples to look at as well as techniques for coming up with ads. I wish I had this book from the beginning.
1,Buyer Beware,Shameful treatment of a wonderful TV show. Garland and her show deserve better. The Streisand/Smothers Brothers episode is edited and is in no way an improvement upon the picture quality of the orginal Pioneer release. So glad I have all of the original Pioneer releases and encourage others to find them as well. I WILL not but any future releases.
1,Poor Value for Money,"I purchased ""Telling Time"" DVD after reading positive reviews on Amazon. I was very disappointed. This DVD is not good value for money. The animation is mediocre and the sound quality is poor. Even if sold at half the price, it would be overpriced. I have purchased numerous educational DVDs over time for my children, mostly through Amazon. This product does not come close to any others we have seen."
4,Easy Learnin',Fun and easy way to learn the basics of speaking Spanish. I'm planning a trip to South America and want to really embrace the culture while I'm there.
1,Easy Spanish Step-By-Step,This book did not help me at all and no one should have to waste thier money on a book that doesn't teach the required spanish that someone would need to live in a hispanic place if one didn't learn spanish earlier on in thier life.
1,Don't do this to yourself,"I wish I had read the customer reviews about this study book before purchasing it and giving myself extra unnecessary stress. I mostly needed math review and started with that; I found seven errors and also typos within the first few hours of studying. The publisher provides a website for corrections, but this book isn't listed there. Two complaint e-mails to publisher elicited no response.My suggestions (having now taken and passed all tests): the ETS book was the most helpful, and Barron's also helped some (thanks to reviewer from Japan who recommended Barron's for math :-)."
1,"""0"" stars should be an option.","EZ girls' score is profoundly awful.The music from the first season was amazing and it introduced me to a lot of great new artists (Kinnie Starr and Fiest are among the best). So what happened? Where did all the talent go? The music has become laughable...The saving grace from the second season is the commentary on the ""lez boat"" episode that was done by the actresses who play Shane, Dana and Alice.During the theme song, Leisha sings ""laughing, crying, breathing, f**king, make this song stop really sucking.""Ilene Chaiken and Betty should really listen to her.When the actors are tearing apart the music, you know it's gotta be bad..."
2,Not what expected,Concentrates strongly on ruins and focus on Meridia NOT Cancun has info on Belize but drwn out and VERY limitred as far as Cancun is concerned.
5,"Very, very, very good!",I have read this book at least three times. A girl gets back at her friends for copying her diary and passing it out at school. But you will never guess how and what she does after that. You'll also never guess the ending. READ THIS BOOK
5,Great Guitar,"Café Tropical and Kiss the Earth are two of Linstead's best, and make my favorites list. I love guitar music, and Lintead's music can really get your blood pumping!"
2,Think again...,"I bought this CD because I loved Mediterranea butthis is not as good and I'm sorry I bought it. It does not have the depth of the earlier CD & mostly just a frantic pace, as if to be showing off his guitar skills. It is one-sided having no deviation, no slower tunes. Some I couldn't stand, the others are just okay, if played quietly."
2,Cautious of Bachman Steam Trains,"Got this for Christmas and was excited to get it! I had been warned about Bachman quality but still wanted this particular train. Ran this on my layout on Christmas day with no problems. Ran it again the day after Christmas and it started to run shaky, erratic and hesitant. Ensured the track was clean and ran my other trains to ensure it was not a track issue which it was not. Afterwards this train continued to give me even worse problems. Great paint job, just very dissapointed in the operation. I am calling Bachmann to see what they will do for me. I have not even had a chance to mail the warranty card yet! More to follow...Since my last post, I sent the train back to Bachman and they repaired it and sent it back with a free tube of HO train oil within two weeks. Runs great now, thanks Bachman."
3,Interesting Premise and Valid Questions,This book examines the questions that will need to be resolved at some point in our existence (my opinion). It's good to ask and it's good to get thinking on this. It's rather weak in some areas (the previous comments explain well enough) but it's good to start the wheels turning.
5,spider bags rock,"wow. i stumbled across this band while checking out birdman's site (their record label). a 30 second sample was enough to impress me...the vocals are unassuming and real ala violent femmes, and the songs sound like blue skies and sunny days but speak more of gutter trash and clouds of smog. in other words, spider bags rock! they combine all the best elements of john fruscinate's early solo stuff with wilco's country-chic vibe and create something really wicked. ""a celebration of hunger"" is my latest favortite album...definitely give it a listen."
3,Great product - except you can't use high heat,"This is a great set, but there were 2 surprises: (1) it isn't dishwasher safe and (2) you can't use high heat. The dishwasher issue isn't a problem because it cleans up very easily by hand. The high heat issue is a problem because I can't sear meat or caramelize. There are two frying pans with the set, but they are pretty much useless. I am going to buy a frying pan that can be used with high heat"
5,very pleased,"I bought a boxed set of this cookware. I am a single male bachelor person, so I make most heavy use of the small skillet for eggs and what not. But after 1 year or more of use, it does not exhibit any deterioration. The small skillet has a thick base and will continue to cook after extinguishing the external heat. I did research prior to purchase, and this is of professional quality and I would recommend it."
4,good basic set,"a good basic set. ergonomics are good regarding weight distribution and handle length. handles don't get hot.only complaint is that I wish that the pots had pour spouts and that the lids had built in strainers. our prior set had this feature and they were very useful for straining pasta, etc."
5,Great Resource,"This book is an amazing resource for those teachers who are gay or lesbian. It is also a good read for those who are curious about the struggles us good teachers have to face in terms of disclosure.So glad I bought this book.If you want to read an incredibly inspiring book please purchase ""One Techer in 10"". You wont regret it"
3,Good Read,"Qiu Jin's book on the Lin Biao incident is an intriguing look behind the scenes of one of communist China's remaining mysteries. Why did Lin turn on Mao? What role did his subordinates play? What effect did it have on China? Some of these questions are not answered, but others are. Most interesting in this book is the role of Lin's family, including his ambitious son and strong wife. The reader with a sense of Chinese history will see that the intrigues of Communist China did not differ much from Imperial China. Jin does a great job and illustrating this. Although she does say some things that are troubling, such as calling Mao ""compassionate,"" overall her treatment of the subject is valuable for the insider perspective that she brings to the subject. I wholeheartedly recommend this book. I hope Jin follows up in the future."
2,Tim Powers Slips,"I am a huge Tim Powers fan, but this book was extremely disappointing.1. There is no sense of place. Powers usually makes you enjoy his locations and they become part of the story. Despite knowing the general location, there is not a single thing interesting about the location.2. Boring characters. Some of the Mossad agents are mildly interesting, but the protagonist and the villains are cardboard. I didn't care about them at all. I didn't even care who ended up victorious.3. Bad use of magical background. Time travel, other dimensions, psychics. Sounds good right? The Anubis Gates meets Last Call? Not even close. Everything is meagerly developed. Supposedly the bad guys want to become gods, but the whole thing is discussed in one or two paragraphs.4. Boring plot. There is no excitement, no sense of dread, no sense of wonder at all.Overall this book was a total dud compared to his other books. Good writing as usual, but not much else.Tim,What happened here?"
5,"Wright Brothers ""Kitty Hawk"" Flyer (1/24 Scale)","Superb! Magnificent! The detail and craftsmanship that went into this museum-quality model of the Wright Brothers' aircraft is absolute perfection. As an aviation history buff, I search for aircraft models that are characteristic in all aspects to their prototypes. Beware of the term ""museum-quality"" as hawked by manufacturers and suppliers of historical models who are more interested in selling product than meeting strict replication standards. This model aircraft is a true masterpiece that can be proudly displayed on your bookshelf or desk. This is not a toy, and the model should be kept from the curious and prying hands of children. Therefore, display it in a safe place. If you're looking for an exact duplication of the famous ""bird"" that started the revolution in aviation history, this is the you want. The price is pretty hefty, but so is the quality. You won't be disappointed!Wright Flyer ""Kitty Hawk"" - 1/24 scale model"
3,casioz4 vs canon s400 vs sony p10,"casio z4:cons: the 2"" tft of casio is just too big, with so-visible loss of image quality; gets easily scratched.pros: pentax lens; ultra slim size for a real pocket-camera.canon s400:cons: small 1.5"" lcd;pros: amazing quality images (even better than bulky canon s50!).sony p10:cons: poor sony lens;pros: 5 mpix, great movie/sound mode.ultimately i recommend canon s400."
4,A Fun Watch,"Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer is not brilliantly acted. Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer will not be nominated for Oscars. Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer will not be remembered for its cinematography.But, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer is one heck of a fun movie to watch.After witnessing the murder of his family by a monster, Jack Brooks (played by Trevor Matthews) struggles to hold his life together, until...he meets Professor Crowley...then all heck breaks lose.If you like monster flicks, this is a must see. It is a blast to watch, if you don't try to take it too seriously."
3,"Funny metaphor about dealing with best, acting horrid","This film did not match my sense of humor, and it was difficult to watch. Surely it was supposed to be ""over the top"", and I did root for the lead character, hoping he'd be able to face his demons (figuratively and actually). But the film was overshadowed by the very ""campy"" type effects (all of the monster looked very fake), and the professor's (Robert Englund)transformation, while humorous, just added to the ridiclousness of this film. I did like the undertone of the film, as it repeatedly suggested that the lead character was running from his past, and he had to ""face his demons"". Ultimately the lead character manages to ""channel"" his angry personality into ""monster hunting"", and his facing his past allows him to diffuse it. Not my cup on tea, but there were a few chuckles to be had."
1,VERY BAD,WELL I DON T LIKE THIS MOVIE AT ALL I COULD N T SEE THE END AS I WAS SO BORINGI DON T LIKE COMEDIE HORROR MOVIE SO
3,"About as close to ""Joe the Plumber""...","Well not really. But, this isn't that bad of a movie to be honest. Not as bad as i thought it was going to be. However, fans of Robert Englund will like this thats for sure and its really great to see him in movies besides another ""Nightmare on Elm St."" stuff.However, this movie starts out with a plumber name Jack and he has ""anger"" issues which connects to his past on top of that, has a ""sort of girlfriend"" he hates and has issues of a life that might not go anywhere until he has to battle monsters just to keep himself alive.This is a very fast pace movie and gets into the action very fast which I'm surprised cause most are slow and draws on the story a tad, which, this movie doesn't have a lot of, but, does have gore, some funny parts here and there, but, not really the worst movie I've ever seen. Rental only though."
3,The only thing missing was horror. BOO!,This movie was exactly how it was hyped.good comedy ... good costumes ... hokeyNobody took themselves seriously.The one thing that would have made it better was to scare the crap out of people like Hostel.That would have been something.;)
1,BBadd music Video,Completely disjointed. This is a mess. Strange camera angles & director seems to have a thing about shoes.Many shots of shoes.No feet in them just a shoe.
3,"runs a little large, decent feel","I bought the last one available at the time, I think I'd like to return it though. I like the looks, but the comfort is just mediocre. If you like the black, white, and red combination give it a try, it doesn't get much cheaper than this."
1,Too much bother,"I bought this several months ago for an upcoming trip. I was seduced by the sleek look and portability, so thank goodness it was cheap because those two things are all it has going for it -- for me anyway. (I don't remember where I bought it -- not Amazon -- so I can't return it.) I pulled it out a couple of days ago because the trip is coming up, and I fiddled around with it for quite a while, but failed to set it, and I am far from a technological idiot. I am sure I could figure it out if I spend enough time, but should I have to and why would I bother for something this cheap? If it's a production every time I change time zones, it's just not worth it, not to mention the possibility of setting it wrong and missing something important. I'm going for something simpler -- one of those mini versions of the old-fashioned alarm clock that simply gives me the current time, a wake up time, and an obnoxious noise to get me up."
4,"My daughter loves it, but I can't stand that they say the word ""stupid"" so much!","I know it is a classic, and it is from another time. I love it too. I just hate that they say the word ""stupid"" so much, usually about Linus's blanket. I wish I could substitue ""stupid"" with ""silly."" Otherwise, it is great. My daughter can't get enough ""Charlie Brown and Snoopy!!!"" as she demands."
1,Read this John 10:31-42,"To all the people and to the author,this comes from the real Book!Every one who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness;sin is lawlessness. You know that he appeared to take away sins; and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him sins; no one who Sins has either seen HIM! or KNOWN HIM. He who does right is righteous,as he is righteous.He who commits sin is of the DEVIL;for the Devil has sinned from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the Works of the Devil; No one born of God commits sin;for god's nature abides in HIM and he cannot sin because he is born of God. By this it may be seen who are the children of God,and who are the children of the Devil:WHOEVER DOES NOT DO RIGHT IS NOT OF GOD,NOR HE WHO DOES NOT LOVE HIS BROTHER AND SISTER! do you know the difference? THIS IS WHAT I WOULD OF LOVED TO HAVE SEEN IN HIS BOOK."
2,1980's Mercury Recordings,"Johnny Cash has been recording since 1955. The majority of this disc contains rerecordings done in the late 80's. The problem with this disc is it's nearly full of remakes from the Sun and Columbia years. Cash put out some good original material from the ""Mercury"" era that should have been on this disc. At least they put ""The night Hank Williams came to town"" on here. I would look for only the original recordings and not buy this one."
3,Radix Castle Adventure by Megabloks,Love the Castle can not seem to find any of the axtras anywhere not even Ebay.What a disppointment for my son who cant stop talking about the rest of the men supposedly available as extras.
5,Terrific!,"Tremendous recordings on this cd. Some of these songs are quite rare and difficult to find. Many critics say that his Army Air Force Band produced some of his best music. This collection is an absolute bargain, and not to be missed by Miller fans."
5,ooo la la - I loved it,"What a fabulous combination of incredible recipes and French music (CD included inside the book)! The perfect gift for Francophiles who are lovers of music, cuisine and art. This would also make a wonderful hostess gift."
1,This is really a poor software program.,"I really can't think on any use for this program other then creating a reference list. And it really doesn't do that well. Once you download to Word, that's right I said download. It doesn't integrate. ANyway after the download, you are on your own. No more help. It can't automatically cite your references. It won't help with format of the body. The only pieces of the paper it set-up are the Title, Header and Abstract. Nothing else!! Really just not worth any money yet alone $$$. I now use Reference Point Software's APA Templates. It opened in word and can even cite for you. Stay away from APA Style Helper."
2,Very Limited Use,"I have only used this software to format my references. I found it very limited in it's use. If you're looking for a comprehensive software that will manage your references, this is not it. I also had trouble using it with my MAC Powerbook 3400c. It would not function properly and the technical support did not get back to after they advised me to download a patch and it would still not work."
1,Buy the APA Publication Manual Instead!!!!!,"Like everybody else says, this software is a waste of money! If you can only buy the APA publication manual or the software, then buy the manual. I had the 3rd edition of the manual from years ago and needed to write a paper for a class. Some classmates told me to download the APA manual instead of buying the manual. Well, I don't know what planet they're from, but unless you already have a clue about APA style, you're still going to need the reference book. Since this is a software product I didn't think to review Amazon reviews first. If I had, and I soooo wish I had, then I'd have the APA Manual, in book form in my hand right now and I'd be $10.00 richer. Argh!!!"
3,Not very useful,"I went for this as a cheap and convenient alternative to the square GND filter that needs frame and all. The results have been disappointing as well. I hardly use it now as the situations where this is helpful is very less.If you are reasonably serious about GND filters, don't waste the 30$ in this product."
4,Mystical & Enchanting Fairy Tale,"If you like Tolkien or Grimm, this book is worth a look. Although ""Pelzmantel"" does not quite have the level of action of ""Lord of The Rings"", I was still very captivated and did not want to put the book down. It was very easy to see why the author, K. A. Laity, won Clive Barker's ""Lord Of Illusions"" contest for her story ""Revelation""."
4,Very Good Product,Very pleased with the performance of this speaker set. Tough to beat for the price.
1,Does not hold enough charge for car battery revival.,"My car battery has died twice due to leaving the headlights on, and both times, it has not been able to help me enough. Both times, it has been fully charged, and it has helped to turn the car alarm and dashboard lights back on. But it does not hold enough power to prevent having to call AAA or ask for a jump. All it has done is caused more aggravation, and it wasted a lot of our time trying to get it to work (1-2 hour from multiple rechargings) instead of just getting a jump from someone (<10 minutes). Worthless as a car charger."
2,Easily broken,"THe little wireless thing that you plug into the computer stopped finding the mouse within 2 weeks of buying the mouse. It also had some odd little quirks working with a Mac. You have to sync it twice if you want it to work properly. I haven't called tec support yet, but at least it has a warranty for five years..."
4,Nice Product,"I've used an older version of Snappy in the past--with good results--but learned recently that it wouldn't work with Windows 2K. Bought Snappy 4.0, and it works wonderful with Windows 2K.By adjusting the snap resolution, you can print great looking stills from your video, besides creating digital images for e-mail, etc.The only reason I didn't give the product a 5 is the lack of customer support, considering that Snappy is (I'm told) out of business."
1,Disappointing,"This may not be fair, as I did not go through all the activities, but the emphasis on low level skills in most of the games tells the whole picture. Yes, playing these games beats doing endless worksheets mindlessly, but to what end? As research has shown (read Children and Number by Martin Hughes), one of the biggest problems faced by beginning learners is the transit from their concrete experience of maths to the abstract knowledge. In other words, while most children are equipped with fundamental math skills when they enter schools, they have difficulties going beyond concrete experiences.My reasons for not giving this book more stars are: 1)it fails to make connections between concrete experience and symbolic representations; 2)it overemphasizes on basic skills; 3)the games are not really fun and creative; 4)they are not really effective in improving math skills. 5 take away 4, so there you have it!"
3,Dramatic,I am not sure I would recomend this for the whole family. It is a little too dramatic for younger kids.
4,Have always loved this movie.,"Some might find it a bit hokey or over the top, but I thought tha movie gave a very compelling vision of what pioneering in the 1870's was really like. Great heartwarming story. Would have given it 5 stars except there was a stretch of about 45 seconds when the colors went very yellow in the flesh tones. Only lasted a bit, but caused me to lose a star in my review."
1,Boring!,Kind of a sweet movie but poorly written...a real yawner! would not buy again...rated too high for me by a long shot! Grandma might have liked this movie! I am a normal regular kind of person and don't need big action and violence..but this movie isn't worth bringing out at Christmas time for the family to watch!
1,Contains no useful information,This is a useless video. It provides almost no information about safety in bear country. Most of the time is spent with the dull host trying to make jokes. This is the second video I saw from the Trailside series and both were horrible. I wouldn't recommend this video for anything.
1,Way too basic,"I bought this for my child to sleep to the nature sounds. After buying it, I found you can only play the nature sounds in the ""sleep"" mode and that they will only play for a maximum of 59 minutes, and then it shuts off! Why can't it just also have an ""on"" and ""off"" button? Also, there is no volume control for the sounds, and most seem pretty loud, but ""ocean"" is the softest. Further, the sounds repeat after a very short time, about 3 seconds, so the pattern is very obvious and could get annoying. I'd say to look for a better product with more features."
1,"Come on, guys, I know you can do better.","Wow. I have never yet met a Moonspell album that didn't have at least a few songs I liked--until now, anyway. This is definitely a low point for one of my favorite bands. The songs basically sound all the same, with only a little variation in vocals and chord progression. Compared to earlier works like Wolfheart and Irreligious, Memorial is a heavy disappointment."
2,This Book Sucks,". . . and I don't say this because I can't do algebra. This book, unlike the algebra books I used when I was at Haverford, seems like it was written by a committee -- a committee of government-sanctioned idiots.Stay away from these highly-processed, politically-correct texts. It's no wonder the nation's kids are getting dumbed down with text books like these."
3,A little disappointing,"Yet another Volume 2 of the Essential series that does not live up to the quality of the first. This volume starts with a weak story and ends with a weaker story, with a few decent ones in-between, including stories involving the Juggernaut and the Mutant Master. The best part of this volume is the origin stories of Professor X, Cyclops, Iceman, and Beast. Also, there is some amazing Jim Steranko art toward the end which makes up for some weak writing on those issues."
4,Cat Mate 4 way locking cat door,"Good quality but hard for the cats to push open. I'm still trying to get a couple of my cats to push it open to exit. Yes it shuts quick, so the cats tails come close to being shut on. It's been weeks now and a couple of cats won't use it. I'll give it another star when all 6 go out on their own."
5,Great Gardening Rack!,"I got two of these shelves over three years ago and have been using them as potting benches outside. They've held up great and are beautiful. I would recommend! I did get them much cheaper, but they may be worth it still!"
4,"Attractive, large utility Mats","I bought these for the floor in front of the rear seats of my wife's Ford Contour. They are attractive, have the big Ford logo, but are a bit too large for my purpose, I had to rotate them and slide the excess under the front seats. Their size and industrial design are more appropriate for use in a truck. Otherwise, I like them. They look like they will be easy to clean (via a good hosing down) compared to the carpet samples she had there previously."
1,NOT a genuine APC battery!,"Item image on the web site shows an APC label, but the item received is NOT a genuine APC battery! Battery received was an off brand that was assembled in Vietnam. APC states using non-APC batteries will void the warranty of the UPS units. They will not replace items connected to the unit if a non-standard battery causes damage. Very disappointed."
1,Not an APC battery as stated.,"This NOT an APC brand battery. This is a generic battery. If you are looking for an OEM battery, you may to want to get it from Newegg. Shame on you Amazon! Hope I have luck with this generic battery. I will not buy another UPS battery from Amazon again, PERIOD!"
5,It could happen to any of us................................,"I sympathize with the previous reviewer... this is a difficult subject to read about, but also to write about. This is an extremely common fear for youths, Mom dying, Dad dying, what if (even worse) they both die! I found this story not predictable and very realistic. The conversations are quite natural and not artifically spiked with interesting tidbits that real life doesn't often have. Real life can be monotonous and petty, yes you still get hungry even if you have had a death(s) in the family. There is something reassuring and so normalizing about the icky relatives, the old pizza boxes, the arguments. There is no need to feel guilty that we are still alive, we continue to have good days and bad days, hopefully families pull together and make a new path from chaos."
2,A not so useful oil pastel painting book,"Having recently purchased a few books on oil pastel I think this is one of the least useful. Overall, the discussion is more devoted to painting aspects such as colour theory, perspective, inventing a composition. But this information is available in any quality book on drawing and painting. There is simply not enough information relating to actually using the oil pastels. Of the books available this would be my last choice. If you are making a collection, you will probably pick one up quite cheaply. I did; but a quick flick through and it is is now on the shelf and probably will not be used again. Definitely better choices available in my opinion."
5,Thought-provoking and laugh-out-loud funny,"A brilliant interweaving of the sublime and the ridiculous that highlights the amazing (sometimes disturbing) varieties of religion in America. The people John Spalding writes about may have peculiar faith practices, but Spalding lets you see beyond the strangeness to the humanity, and even the validity, of their perspectives. He lets his subjects speak for themselves, adds some historical background to give grounding, and suffuses it all with his unique sense of humor. I must say I chuckled my way through the essay about the man who drilled a hole in his head to relieve stress, but by the end I was thinking there might be something to his approach!"
2,Not worth $29!,"This is certainly not worth $29. Would have gotten 4 stars if costed half of what it is. Instructions are good and clear, but camera angle not good since third person view rather than first person view which makes it difficult to follow. Find something else for a cheaper price."
2,Too hyped i think !!,Great cover shot and from previous reviews i thought it wouldbe full of some great obscure and different photos but alas no..It is largely a book of portraits of surfing greats but not many of actual surf. i thought it would be like thomas campbells stuff but it wasnt.
3,Interesting introduction to massage,"I found the soundtrack and the scenery very soothing and found the tape very easy to watch. Even with the ""cuts"" to different sessions, everything flowed well together. The narrator repeated information when necessary, so if you were performing a massage while following along, you wouldn't miss anything. I find this video to be a good introduction to a technique of massage or couple's massage. There are a few problems that I had with the video:While all of the therapists behaved professionally on the video during each phase of the massage session, several of them were dressed inappropriately. And I also question the abdominal massages where there was no chest draping for the female clients. The ""T"" factor is not necessary in order to learn this technique!The massage presentation was very good, despite those couple of drawbacks. I give it 3-1/2 stars."
1,Long Drawn Out Tale,This book was slow from the start and had its hot and cold moments. But the scenes were too drawn out. And the steamy romance scenes infamous of Arabesque books was not present. I try to finish every book I start but just could not bring myself to finish this slow tale.
3,"Absolutely Nothing Against Ramsey Lewis, But .....","I refuse to be a sycophant and award 5 stars based solely on the man's acclaim and musical genius. Especially when he had over 20 R&B;/Billboard Pop Hot 100/Adult Contemporary (AC) hits from 1964 to 1987, and they provide only eight of them in a 12-track album titled ""The Best Of Ramsey Lewis!""Two of the 12 here were failed Argo singles from 1963 (Look-A-Here and Blues For The Night Owl), while two were culled from his many LPs (Since I Fell For You from the 1965 LP ""The In Crowd"" - and Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child from the 1958 Mercury LP ""Down To Earth"").This does provide two pages of liner notes by Joseph F.Laredo along with a discography of the contents and a few more nice shots of Ramsey, including one with his original trio, which included bassist Eidee Young and drummer Red Holt. And the sound quality is quite good. But it just doesn't go deep enough into his ""best"" to warrant more than 3 stars."
1,Pathetic psychobabble,"I knew the author as a younger man ...has morphed into an amalgam of Dr. Ruth and Dr. Phil. Death of a close relative effects people in profound ways, yet personalities are mostly immutable. Ann Arbor is a granola city, but please. I found the prose stilted and the examples right in line with the general tendency of people in the helping professions to generalize their advice to the masses to sell books. Waste of time!!!"
3,good price & good for beginners,"The book and CD combo were a good price. The CD was good for relaxation/meditation, but the book passages weren't so much meditation practices as they were passages about how the baby is developing and advice on prenatal practices that would be found in any pregnancy book (re: take prenatal vitamins. eat leafy greens etc.) If you are completely new to meditation or feel completely overwhelmed with or detached from your pregnancy this is a good book to start connecting with baby. If you are experienced in meditation and practices to increase your self-awareness you will find the info in this book no more supportive to your pregnancy than practices that you are probably doing on your own."
4,Advanced embroidery,If you are an expert stitcher this book is easy to follow. Makes great designs for those that enjoy puzzle artwork.
1,Not as advertised - misleading,"I purchased this item for the TV Guardian feature, but I cannot find it on the set up menu. I have even had an(very limited and not easy to come by)email from customer service that explained the steps as to how to get it to work. It is just not there. It has a feature that allows me to set the level of movie allowed to play (G, PG, R etc...) but that is not what TV Guardian is. It was only about $40 with $15 shipping so to send it back would be a waste. So I guess I will just have to keep it as a back up or ebay item."
1,"Good while it lasts, which may not be long","My first RCA DRC285 player performed very nicely for about 6 weeks, and then failed, with the picture freezing into a random pattern on the HD screen, and with all controls on the unit and the remote having no effect. Unplugging it unfroze it for a few times, and then it crashed altogether. I sent it to Thomson's Austin, Texas warranty return location, and two months later received a replacement unit. This one lasted through about 5 DVDs and failed so completely that not even unplugging it could unfreeze it. I haven't decided if I will send this one in for another warranty replacement. The new instructions indicate you now have to send it to Canada, which really speaks poorly for Thomson Electronic's response to their obvious quality control problems. Unless you hear that the Canadian models are way more reliable, I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone, which is too bad. For basic upconvert DVD viewing, I thought it worked quite nicely.SD"
4,Excellend guide to stress vreakdown,"This is a clearly written and easily understandeable brief guide to the meachnics of stress breakdown. It helped me tremendously ten years ago when I was in the depth of a low period and worried that I was suffering from depression. In fact, I was able to discern that my symptoms were due to stress and once the external stress had eased, I got better.My memory might let me down here, but I remembered extra passages in the book relating to personality types which at the time had been of great use to me - these passages have now been sacrificed to revision (no doubt for good reason) and I was disappointed not to find them again.However, I would highly recommend this book for a layman who is either interested in the processes involved in stress breakdown or the person who suffers from depression."
1,Not What I Expected or Wanted,"This is not the ""International"" in a classic London venue; it is a competition in Ostrava in a lack-lustre setting resembling a 1/4-filled gymnasium. The DVD production resembles an old home video: camera-work is mediocre, video quality (touted as ""enhanced"") is poor, sound quality is poor--on top of a very weak music presentation from the venue itself. Having seen in person most of these couples dance at better venues, this DVD did not do them justice. In short, it is a poor-quality production displaying the end of the era of British-defined/dominated International style competition ballroom dancing. I was greatly disappointed and would not recommend it."
5,Very reliable,I have used this to measure powder for thousands of rounds now it seems to be the most consistant powder measure I have ever used.
3,"Good, but not great",I thought this was a very interesting work. The book's characters were developed and the action was intense. One of my biggest gripes though was that I expected more. The cover gives the impression that these people are die hard commandos with high tech military back up. On the other hand these commandos had little backup and no basic military interference. I enjoyed Kasner's work but there are much better techno thrillers out there.
5,Kucinich's Vision is Light Years Ahead of Other Candidates,"Dennis Kucinich's laserlike ability to get right to the heart of any issue and understand that issue comprehensively is far ahead of the other people masquerading as Presidential candidates.Having recently re-read the book, I'd like to say that Kucinich is just as good a writer as he is a public speaker--and he is an electrifying public speaker. Very few people can write and speak equally well but Kucinich does.He is highly intelligent but explains complex issues in plain, everyday language that everyone can understand.I am anxiously awaiting his autobiography, ""The Courage to Survive"" which will be a classic!"
2,Good essay from Studs Terkel; the rest is new-age nonsense,"Dennis Kucinich inspired me to get into politics. He is a courageous progressive who stands up for that in which he believes. That said, this book is not worth even the bargain price. It begins with a great essay from Studs Terkel, but then descends into a lot of Kucinich's new-age, moon-beam psycho-babble. Is it any wonder that the media considers him a joke? Mr. Kucinich should stick to his progressive populist platform (an ideology with which I no longer identify, to be fair) instead of drifting into Natural Law Party metaphysics. Terkel's essay deals with the former, the rest of the abbreviated book deals with the latter. Buyer beware."
5,A Prayer for America,"This Masterpiece by Dennis kucinich is a must read. in the book he talks about what America is looking for in a president and how he himself can answer the prayers that many Americans are asking for... and that prayer is peace, love, and justice Dennis is all of those. After reading this i wish i had the chance to vote for him in the last democradic election. Things could have been a lot better for us all."
5,Awesome book for young women!,Dennis Kucinich is the man to lead America to a better world for everyone. By supporting him and his book we will see a new democracy of equality and freedom prosper! Please buy Kucinich's book for a better tomorrow! Thank You.
4,Wave rebel 42 inch boardbody,I like this board because it is great for beginners. I like how it has a beginners tail and the board is not made out of that cheap foam. It comes with a strap to go on your wrist. The only problem that prevents me from giving this product a 5 star is the color. I can't choose a color and i'm a guy. I received a redish pink board.
3,I like them but....,"I use these to keep the carbides form tearing up my enclosed trailer. They don't fit the new Ski-Doo skis that great, so I will have to make the loops bigger. Otherwise I like them."
5,A must read Thriller,This was a very intense book. I enjoyed reading and was surprised by the events that unfolded.I couldnt put it down sometimes I had to find out what happened next. The best parts is when you start connecting the dots of the Jack Man and the twisted connections to the jack man. Each chapter I read got more and more twisted. A must read for anyone that likes a good thriller book.
1,Very poor,"This is an absolutely awful book. It trades in on common misconceptions with dogs, and then goes on to make generalizations about breeds that have no business circulating. Thanks to this fine author, people can parade around their poodles and say they have the second smartest dog in the world... Never mind that they are tethered to a puppy mill inbred. Generalizing that Border Collies are smarter than Poodles are smarter that Rottweilers is just plain asinine. What was the sample size? (I believe it was like 5 dogs.)Maybe this book was supposed to make some owners feel better or something... Beats me. Read the Wiki on ""Dog Intelligence""... Coren's only barometer for ""intellect"" revolves around the dog's willingness to please, which he still hasn't recognized because he's too busy believing the ""Alpha Dog"" myth.Save your money and buy your lil' man some bully chews."
2,So so.,Just a general book about dogs. I did not find it very informative compared to other sources. Save your $
2,Shallow and Dippy,"This book would have been a real let down if I hadn't known from the start it would be Dippy. The plot could not get any shallower, and that is writen form a ten year old's view. The twists were not rollar coaster worthy, more like the merry go round. If you are under eight and 'Horse Crazy' you might very well find it satisfying. Still, for a younger child it is a good gift choice. Buy it for a birthday present for a child."
4,A Good Start to the Series,"Horse Crazy is the first book in the series. This book is a good start, but having read a lot of the other saddle club books, I think that Bonnie's done better. The book does keep you turning the pages, although some parts, such as Lisa instinctively knowing how to post and sit to the canter, are unrealistic. Riding can come easy to some people but there's no way that you'd figure out how to canter, basically your first time riding a horse! I did love parts of this book though, and would reccomend the rest of the series."
5,Great book!,"Very good book! Carole and Stevie are best friends, and they are going to go on a Mountain Trail Overnight (MTO) togther. However, Stevie's parents say that they won't pay for it unless her grades go up. (It costs $50 to go) Now Stevie has decided that she can't possibly get her grades up, so she is going to earn the $50 herself! Lisa Artwood is also riding at the stables while Stevie is trying to earn the money. She is new, and has never ridden a horse before. Carole likes her but Stevie doesn't. Veronica (the snob) wants to add her to her ""collection"" of friends, and Lisa feels mixed up about it. Worth buying, reading, and never putting it down! Stevie isn't quite as funny in this book though, she has always been one of my favorite charachters."
3,"Great Ideas, boring to read.","This book has great ideas, which I totally agree with. As an unschooler I like to read about this stuff. This book is just boring and hard to get into. I will still read it because I am very intrested in what he writes."
3,good for your children,"This is the first John Holt book I have read. I think I had higher hopes for it. It is highly anecdotal (as opposed to data driven). But I believe his claims to be true for children and their learning abilities. I think if you are being told that your children are ""learning disabled"" or not keeping up, or not meeting expectations, that this is a good read to help you feel confident that ALL children will learn at their own pace and in their own style. They need us to have faith in them, to love them and to hope with them."
3,strange frequency modulations,"do you like soft machine? then chances are, you already own this Arkham cd. this is an album of live recordings and practice tapes of this instrumental drums/bass/organ trio. this stripped down bare set up displays a great sense of dynamics in their songwriting and a flair for some unique improvisation. the sound quality suffers (on some tracks worse than others) but there is plenty here for the fan of the canterbury rock sound (or even maybe a Doors fan) to enjoy. overall, an interesting...but not essential historical document."
4,"""Got To Give It Up...Motown...Island Def Jam...A&M Records""","Much like its predecessor ""LOVE FUNK""(314-541-583-2) digging into the vaults ofMotown, Island Def Jam and A&M Records...with talents from The GapBand...Cameo...Rick James...Billy Preston...Ohio Players...James Brown...MarvinGaye...Con Funk Shun...Commodores...Brothers Johnson...L.T.D.(featuring JeffreyOsborne)...Bar-Kays, giving all R&B collectors something to sink their teeth into.But the highlight has to be ~ ""GOT TO GIVE IT UP""(1977-Marvin Gaye), intoxicating beatwith Live mixing in the background from the London Palladium, have to admit, Gaye is a hardact to follow or beat...and Marvin definitely has the BEAT!So let's get FUNKY...pick this one up and let the party begin---if you enjoyed this one, whynot try ""The Funk Box""(314-541-789-2)...both collections are a REAL GAS!Total Time: 75:03 on 12 Tracks ~ Universal/Hip-O Records 314-541-584-2 ~ (2002)"
2,Missing a bunch,"I noticed that it was missing ""Old Man"" by Neal Young, ""One Way Out"" by The Allman Brothers, and ""Cat Scratch Fever"" by Ted Nugent. This was after seeing the movie once and maybe not even the whole thing. So I just checked the song credits at the end of the film. There were 41 songs listed. So this CD is missing more than a few. I find that very dissapointing."
1,They really need to revamp this booklet...,"I thought since I live in an area with a large Asian population that I would enjoy this book, but that is far from the case. Not only it is the smallest of the Wei Chuan books, it has some nasty Western recipes in there as well. Simple is better. Why didn't they put more vegetable recipes like steamed Chinese brocoli with vegetarian oyster sauce? Instead they have a positively putrid recipe for potato salad and even vegarian hamburger! It's not worth $7.95 or $12 with shipping. They need to redo the recipes, do more things with tofu, and even some brown rice clay pot recipes. I can't find very many recipes which I would make."
3,Would have paid $10,"I do like the ring but I feel like paying $15.00 was not worth it. It looks better in the picture and I feel like I am playing dress-up when I wear it. Overall, it's an ok buy if the price was a little cheaper."
5,HEART RING,"THIS RING IS DAINTY, AND ELEGANT!!!! I ORDRED THIS RING FOR A PINKY RING AND IT IS ABSOULETLY STUNNING!!! AS USUAL AMAZON YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN!!!!! ITEM RECEIVED AS DESCRIBED, FAST, PROMPT DELIVERY!!!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!"
5,Love it!,This ring looks even better than the picture shown. It's very comfortable to wear. What a great buy!!!
1,High Stakes Vegas Vampires,"I really enjoyed this whole series. The mix of action, love and lust is great. The books are a fast read and a lot of fun."
2,I have to buy another book?,"Erin McCarthy writes funny, racy books and this one doesn't disappoint - at least not till the end. Then suddenly a new character is found to be the source of all the trouble but disappears after that reveal.Turns out Sasha Checkikov is a short story in Erin's next book, First Blood. Well I haven't got extra to buy another book for essentially the epilogue, so I guess I don't get to find out how this story actually ends. Just the record, those of you who write serials, the pertinent bits need to be in the stories. Supplemental is ripping off your readers."
2,Bleh,"I was super excited to start reading this series. I unfortunately bought the first two books never thinking I would not enjoy them. I didn't even get through this one. I found I just could NOT like the characters. The whole Vampire President thing was just lame, Alexis was so not nice, and Ethan was a big old weiner. Like paranormals? Stick to Kresley Cole and Cynthia Eden."
1,pure propaganda,"you guys must REALLY be smokin that dope, this book is hot garbage. it is filled with government style propagandic writing, framing the u.s. effort as that of angels, and the iraqi region as caveman central.so ""rah rah"", so jingoistic, bush might as well hand this out at picnics and church luncheons."
3,disappointed in quality,"I bought this for my 4 year old and she has played with it a few times although not as much as I had hoped. It looked great but with in a few days a piece was broken in half, by my toddler who is not quite 2 yrs. Does fiberboard count as wood??? I'm really disappointed in the durability of this product. I think the ""made of wood"" advertising is misleading."
5,"A ""Gem"" Of A Movie!","When you first start watching this movie, you think the director has a budget of $10. But what you discover is a pioneer of the indendent film. This little gem is a whisical tale of 7 year old Joey Norton, who's dooped by friends into thinking he's shot and killed his older brother, Richie. Upon believing this, Joey exiles himself to Coney Island, with Richie in hot pursuit. The film does a wonderful job of catching the innocence of the 50's. If you can get them away from the computer, video games and Sponge Bob, I truly believe that even kids today would enjoy this little piece of ""Americana"""
2,Done Better by Forta,"I was REALLY looking forward to a juicy new book that showed some real-world examples of what CF can do. What I got was a rehash of the CF documentation and the Ben Forta book, ""The ColdFusion Web Application Construction Kit 4.0"", which goes into quite a lot more depth. The copy is nice and might be an easier read for the beginner, but I would have to say I'm disappointed."
2,disappointing . . .,"At 846 pages of ""Mastering"" ColdFusion one would think that this book would have more on integrating JS or doing complex queries . . . no such luck. If you have taken the ""Fast Track"" class, you could have easily written this book. This is definitley for beginners."
3,Weak effects let the side down,"Dan Curtis , of ""Dark Shadows"" fame ,made this TV movie as a contractual obligation to ABC-TV and it was originally to have involved the great Harlan Ellison as a writer .The project was then known as Dark Destroyer but sad to say absolutely nothing remains of Ellison's proposed involvement in the projectThe story is perfectly functional for the type of movie it is -a woman finds that during the cycle of the moon she turns into a giant blood drinking spider,the result of an ancient Native American curseTony Franciosa is good as a private investigator caught up in the plot and there is sturdy ,professional support from Jeff Corey as a shaman and from Vic Morrow as a cynical cop .The weaknesses of the venture are an impoverished script and some woeful special effects which stop it rising above the mundane .Watchable if you are not in too demanding a mood"
3,good brand,I really like the company but they came out with a cheap pre-workout stimulant that at the recommended dosage(one tablet) did nothing for me. I bought cheap I got cheap.
5,His best.,"Simple, but glorious, the flight of the Stonor Eagles finds its true path in the author's shortest, yet most satisfying novel, telling of the barbarism of the zoo, for all its fugitives. Paul Simon sang it, and the echo drones like Schubert from this book, until, unlike the hapless composer, freedom comes. It seems many haven't bothered this author beyond Duncton, but they should not fear dissappointment, nor relish a tale which can be reread over a day, not a month."
1,terrible as dog diarrhea,this is the worst cage. the birds can easily poop outside the cage and make a mess when they sit on the parts that bow out. terrible as donkey balls do not buy!
2,Quality is lacking,"Yes, this is a good selection of songs from Sons of the Pioneers. Unfortunatly, the recording is also obviously created from old vinyl recordings. There is an unacceptable amount of hiss and popping on several tracks that really detracts from the music and I have yet to figure out if the recording is stereo (don't think so). I was really disappointed at the quality but for those of you who miss the nostalgia of a well-worn mono LP, give it a try. I doubt that I'll be listening to this CD much."
3,thin line between love and obsession,"Meeting in the Ladies Room is about Jackie Blue, who's in trouble because her very important boss is dead and suspicion has fallen on Jackie. Naturally the rest of the book is a race to keep herself out of trouble but the most intense parts of the book and the most interesting are the parts that deal with the nature of obsession. Jackie is obsessed with Victor, Paul is obsessed with Jackie and Victor, well, Victor's got a whole messy issue of his own. I liked the book tremendously."
4,tough as nails,My son has had this truck for months and is played with constantly. We have tile floors and this truck has hit the floor an innumerable amount of times and there is not even a crack in it! I am surprised how durable it is! We love this truck.
4,This is a Great Product!,"I'm upgrading from a 10"" Hitachi saw (less than 3 stars) that was stolen. This Bosch is great. Yes, it IS heavy, and you can't see the laser in outside use. But, it is solid, accurate and has great repetition on angle cuts. I've just finished installing a crown molding project that went flawlessly, with joints being tighter than I've ever seen. The blade, as noted before, could be better: it results in slight tear out where the blade exits cuts.One drawback... The locking mechanism that locks the side to side rotation has broken. Now, when I tighten the twist knob in the front, the saw rotates off the desired angle. So, into the repair shop tomorrow although I've had the saw for less than 2 weeks. Still, I think it is a great product and would be 5 star if not for the broken lock."
5,Magnificent,"Chilean Songwriter and performer, incredible capability, his music really moves, its kind of folk retro style, and is usually compared to Victor Jara or Silvio Rodriguez, but adding electronic beats sometimes or more ethnic instruments. His young debut has impressed everyone and he just started filling venues, without even promoting himself, just passing it by voice.Its a really good musician and i totally raccomand it, as i do also raccomand other singers from QUEMASUCABEZA like javiera mena."
1,"Great movie, horrible bootleg copy","This is one of my all-time favorite horror movies. However, this copy is a huge ripoff -- it's a VHS dub that was run through some amateur DVD authoring software and burned to DVD-R. The cover was printed on a low-end inkjet printer. I am extremely disappointed with this."
3,Not Enough Information,"Too little informaton. Does not discuss any type of information on guinea pig diseass, how to bath your pig, or buying the perfect cage. A quick read, not worth the price I paid for it."
2,These are not instant,"This book was ok. It is not instant. The pages are black and white. You have to color, cut, glue and laminate these before using them."
4,hand guard mounts,"The mounts fit my 2011 KTM 300 XC well, there seems to be a slight misalignment, but if you tighten all 4 allens evenly it goes away, The quality is very good"
2,Nasty chemical aftertaste,"I wasn't expecting much from a calorie-free ""chocolate"" dip. I figured it would taste mostly like artificial sweetener, and so I didn't plan to eat it straight. I sliced up a banana, put a tablespoonful or so of the dip on it, and then topped with with some fat-free whipped topping--so there were two things I *really* like in the bowl with the dip.I still couldn't finish it. I'm a diabetic, so I have to watch the amount of sweets I eat; I have a real sweet tooth, so I'm *used* to the flavour of artificial sweeteners and ""fake"" foods. (People, I think Fat Free Cool Whip is *good stuff*. We're talking ""not a gourmet,"" here. Definitely not a food snob. But I thought that this was NASTY.Why two stars? Because my housemate *loved* it. He's happily spooning it onto oatmeal, fruit, graham crackers... he may be putting it on his hamburgers, for all I know. :) And if someone else thought it was *that* good, I can't give it one star, even if I personally loathe it."
4,Seriously not that bad,"The Walden Farms chocolate dip is really not that bad. I've tried a few of the Walden Farms products and this is the only one that I've ordered again. For a ""calorie-free chocolate dip"" it's actually pretty good. The taste resembles chocolate a lot more than the claimed taste of some of the other Walden Farms products I've tried (for example the Chipotle Ranch dressing - yuck). The consistency is similar to pudding, but a little firmer. It's no substitute for Hershey's (or whatever) chocolate dip, but it is calorie free."
4,lots of energy for a great work out,"I had more energy than ever to work out. I was struggling with my weight and had a problem with fatigue. This pill gave me the boost I needed (along with a low calorie no dairy diet, and a balle's membership) to drop 30lbs in 3 months. I still have more to loose so i just purchased another bottle. If I did say anything bad about the pill it would be that the higher dose makes me crazy jittery. but the low dose was the perfect amount of energy."
4,Better way to OpenGL by Delphi.,This book is good book for larning OpenGL Programming by Delphi.I was for long time seaching kind of this book.
2,"Long on code, short on explanations","This is hardly a ""developer's"" guide. Only the most rudimentary of examples are given, and most of the 450+ pages are reprints of source code listings."
1,Low quality and poorly written book,"Two-thirds of the book are code listings which can be found on CD. Some code does not produce the effect the author described. You poor guys have to bear and grin since this is the only book you can find about this subject. If you are a beginner for both Delphi and OpenGL, this book may be more or less helpful. I strongly recommend you to find useful info on the internet."
2,boring....and where ... is Alison Krauss on this thing?,"Yeah...this album leaves a lot to be desired, and the sticker on the cellophase packaging said Alison Krauss was in the mix. I can't find her. The Time After Time cover is rediculous. Only the Maria and and Just Dropped In (reminded me of the Highway Men)were good."
1,Disappointing...,"Very disappointing follow up to ""Milk Cow Blues."" I could only manage to listen to this CD two times before retiring it. Only two tracks on this CD, ""the Great Divide"" and ""Just Dropped In,"" are reminiscent of Willie's previous musical stylings. This is apparently Willie's lamentable attempt at achieving the musical mainstream, and only one song was actually written by him. Included in his cover versions is Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" - enough said. If you love Willie for what he has done in the past, this CD is probably not for you. If you hate Willie for what he has done in the past, then this CD may appeal to you."
1,Yuccccccck,"I like Willie Nelson...or at least I thought I did. This is truly evidence that there is a time when one should not sing anymore. This is probably the worst cd I have ever heard. It is almost unbearable to listen to. Kid Rock? Bonnie Rait? I wouldn't be surprised if Cyndi Lauper jumps him in a dark alley some day for his rendition of Time after Time.The menagerie of duets should have never happened. It will go down in the books as ""everybody makes a mistake at least once""Willie.....find a day job!"
3,The River Warren,"An intriguing exploration of human behavior and motivations. The story line develops through separate chapter characters. However, Meyers does a better job of plot and writing in his later work ""The Work of Wolves,"" which I consider an outstanding novel."
5,Best hat and helmet light,I've tried all type of lights for my hat and motorcycle helmet. Garrity snake eyes LED are by far the best at any price. They're hard to find. Just bought 5 at around $15. Most everywhere are at $20+. Fast delivery from this seller.
3,This is not the Trace Projector!,There was no picture and going by the description you might mistake this for the Crayola Trace Projector. It's not!
4,GREAT FOR GIRLS WHO LOVE TO DRAW,"My daughter is 6 & she loves this toy. It's not one that gets old after 2 days. There are so many variations to draw from, endless combinations. The older she gets, the more she loves it. Her older friends especially like it. It's good for motor development in trying to do the tracing."
4,I Can't Believe it..,"I loved this book up until the end. All I can say prepare yourself for a surprise ending that you may or may not like. Personally, I was saddened. This is why the book only gets 4 stars instead of 5. Anyway, the book focuses on the ""akino"" and Isabel is now going through hers. Only she refuses to connect to the consciousness because of what it has done to Max. So her and Micheal run away for her to tough it out without the stones. They enlist Trevor in the cause and he ultimately shows them how to survive the akino without making the connection. All in all a good book.. with the exception of the big surprise in the end."
3,A little disappointed,"I hate to stand against the general favors here, and in spite of my effort to really enjoy it, I failed to do so. After all the raving reviews on Amazon, I threw myself into the book with excitement, only to be disappointed by mediocre characters, dull literary style and storyline - although it's based on history, regardless, it's a blend of fiction. And a fiction that lacked any amount of originality, at that -- I see it as more of a narrative of historical references scrapped together with a tiny bit of imagination thrown into it.I confess that I'd had extremely high expectations on the book, but I think it natural, after all the inavoidable exaltations. But in all fairness, I also admit that while the plot was none too unique, the general flow of the story was smooth and that there were, though very few, scenes in which I found my heart reaching out..A decent book to spend your spare time on; not to loose sleep over."
3,Curiously flawed,"This is a great read - vivid characters, colorful settings, gripping narration. But I was continually distracted by Penman's unfortunate stilted sentences - a curious habit. Does she think such usage adds authenticity? It doesn't! Again and again my attention rested on her condensed syntax rather than on the wonderful yarn she's telling. It's quite an ususual mannerism, and quite a negative one, as it mars the believability of her characters."
5,Here Be Dragons,"Marvelous! ""Here be Dragons"" and its two sequals(""Falls the Shadow"" & ""The Reckoning"") are my favorite books of all time. Am currently in the process of re-reading all three - something I seldom ever do. My heart went out to Llewelyn Fawr and his decendents in their neverending struggles with the greedy English kings."
5,"Outstanding, a perfect blend","This is a perfect blend of historical fiction and romance. The story does not stray too far from historical accounts. It is deftly written, with well drawn characters and a compelling story. Do not be intimidated by the length of the story, it is well told."
4,Yay for Duane Steele,"My favorite song on this CD is I-65 (showing as 7-65 in error on this site). This country singer has a great voice, lyrics, and melodies. I wish we could get more Canadian Country singers on the US radio stations"
4,Annoying,"Product came quickly and as described. Clock has a lot of non-standard features for such a small package and cheap price. And the actual alarm has a super annoying tone, very hard to sleep through."
2,Viewing angle problem spoils nice alarm clock,"This clock has a nice design, easy to use and doesn't take up a lot of night stand space. But in order to see the clock at night when you hit the light button you have to be significantly higher than the clock. For some reason the LCD display is not visible when the backlight is on unless you are at least 30 degrees higher than the clock. Since our nightstand is level with the bed, it makes reading the time at night impossible."
4,it's nice,it has several nice features :- a very good size display (i see it from a realy far place).- i like the features it has & specially the temperature feature.- i also like the idea that it doesn't have wire which makes it easy to put anywhere- it's slim- the back light feature is very nice BUT it stayes for EXREMELY VERY SHORT TIME.
1,Hand Grips Made of Sticky Plastic,"The hand grips are made of some weird sticky plastic that leaves a residue on your hands. I had to speak directly with Invacare to get permission to return it and they asked if ""maybe I had put on some hand lotion"". Don't insult my intelligence! I will never order another Invacare product. They also took over 2 months to credit my return."
4,its gotten a little better!,i watched this online too as soon as youtube loaded the second season of the lair. its almost better than the first season. i wonder what season 3 has in store?
1,A horrible book,"I found this book to be quite useless. It was poorly written and filled with editorial errors. Furthermore, the supposed ""sample MCATs"" did not at all resemble the actual test. Oftentimes, the science passages in the book were little more than a paragraph. In addition, the book stressed unimportant trivia while overlooking vital concepts."
3,too chopped to pop,The recent released version of this Zorro is too chopped-up. the original version is well worthy of a five star rating. The effort to cut down the violence or bloody scenes was too damaging to the movie. I have it in BETA format from UA and it's a great movie to have in one's collection. I really would like to have the full uncut version on DVD.
2,What a disappointment!!!,"The quality of this dvd is horrible. I've seen old movies in 3d with the red blue glasses that are excellent (It Came From Outer Space & Creature From The Black Lagoon), but this seems to be a 5th generation video copy that was pressed to dvd. Paramount should be ashamed of releasing this crap!"
3,It's Okay,"Not the best of the originals, but certainly not the worst in the series.Part three picks up (supposedly) immediately following part two however, Jason's entire look changed for this movie. He's bathed, changed his clothes and gone bald all in a matter of hours. Okay, so bathing and changing one's clothing doesn't take long, but the guy lives in shack with his dead mother's corpse and no plumbing, so I'm not sure where his new clothes came from, nor am I convinced he'd care. The bald head remains a mystery."
1,Warner bros Blu Ray Re-Release Friday The 13TH Part 3 3D,This Is Just A Rehash Of Paramount's 2009 Blu Ray Nothing DifferentBut That The Cardboard 3D Glasses Are Plain White Now And A Little Sticker Over Paramount's Bar code That Says Warner Home Video.
3,"""Blu-ray"" YES, ""Blu-ray 3D"" NO!","When I first purchased this it was mis-labeled as ""Blu-ray 3D"". Amazon has since re-labeled the item to just ""Blu-ray"". Package includes 2 old-school paper ""3D glasses"". Good product for comparisons of old and new technology!"
3,Dissapointing,"I'll have to admit I was dissapointed when I saw this movie. Jason wasn't scary at all. I just didn't get that certain ""Friday the 13th"" feeling. Yes, Jason gets his hockey-mask, but that doesn't lift this movie so much. In this movie, Jason shows his real face, (he looks just like another deformed person) but that wasn't scary at all...just stupid. And some other things: Jason is actually running? He also makes some sounds/noises when he gets hit. This isn't the real Jason. I would prefer parts 4-9 ten times to this. At least this sequel contains great gore. Steve Miner is a great director, but unfortunely he was not lucky this time!"
1,why bother with the 3D?,as others have mentioned the 3D portion of this dvd is terrible to non-existent. i got suckered into buying a movie i already had solely for the 3D version which is unwatchable. i love this movie and it's still great in 2D but don't waste your money if you plan on watching it in 3D.
1,You WILL be disappointed with the 3D,"This sounded like such a good idea! This classic 1983 slasher in 3D just like back in the theaters 30 years ago! I didn't see this movie in the theaters so I don't know if the 3D effect ever worked. But it sure as hell doesn't work on this Blu-Ray. The glasses are flimsy cardboard as expected and they give you a headache for good measure. The 3D scenes are blurry and dark. Besides the terrible 3D, the special features on this disk are awful! The only ""special feature"" that is any good is the original theatrical trailer but I'm sure a fan of this series has seen it a thousand times. Do yourself a favor and stick to whatever version of this movie you still have even VHS."
2,Steve Miner's Friday the 13th Part 3,"(Spoilers?)This was the one where Jason finally gets his hockey mask. After surviving the events of Part 2, Jason goes to a near by small store and kills a couple. It's sort of odd that he has no hair in this one after he had hair at the end of Part 2. Anyway, Jason makes his way to a cabin in the woods in which teens are staying at. This time he goes after the couple Chris Higgins and Rick, a jokester named Shelly, two girls, two pot smokers, and three bike gangsters. Most of the murders took place in the barn. Even though the climactic chase scene was fairly good, the ending was horrible. In Chris' dream, Jason is alive again with his mask off and runs to out of the barn. At that same time, Mrs. Voorhees pulls Chris under water. How is that possible. Chris didn't even know about Mrs. Voorhees. Not being at Camp Crystal Lake hurt this film. This series just didn't have the same magic as the Halloween Series..."
2,Not one of the series' best.,"Jason gets his hockey mask (and kills a bunch of teens in the woods)! Plot-wise, that's the only thing differentiating it from the previous entries. There's also the fact that the movie was filmed in 3-D, which explains why there's a lot of dangerous objects waved maniacally in front of the screen. Not much in the way of suspense, and while Dana Kimmell and Catherine Parks are hot, neither get naked. The last twenty minutes, a big stalk and chase sequence, is pretty good, however, and the movie's only real saving grace. Better than part 2, but hardly the most enjoyable film of the series."
3,The one that started it all....,"Acclaimed director Steve Miner (the notoriously neverending House films and Halloween H20) handles Friday the 13th Part 3 brilliantly. From a slow Part 1 and 2 nobody expected to see this as a decent horror movie but in fact it wasn't that bad. Jason gets his murdermask in this one, the famous hockeymask. More humour is added in this suspenseful slasher thriller with 3D effects, which at the time in the early eighties was a real plus. Probably one of the best of the series but the plot still remains the same- a group of libidinous teenagers despite warnings enter the bloody Camp Crystal only to be stalked upon one by one. The acting isn't great but as I said before not a bad attempt to what we later see as a worthless series."
3,Solid!!,"This one was pretty good,Jason finally gets his hockey mask, shoots and arrow gun into a women's eye, very gore and brutal."
3,jason hacks up bikers,"he hacks up bikers.thats the storyline.its the last of the original 3.in the big scheme of things this is low on the friday the 13th food chain.i gave all of them but 1 ,3 stars,so its still good!with a bunch of bikers hanging around,youre assured something vile will happen even before jason pop in.even the hells angels or whatever biker gang they are cant stop jason!hell itself couldnt keep him down either! there are now 11 parts.he gets to hell in part 9.;"
3,Bad 3d for a home title,"This was released in 3d locally in anaglyphic. Doesn't transfer well from Polarized 3d. Still doesn't work well. The original print was clearly taken from the Eastman color print which has clearly faded over time. Color changes from full color to red through the print. Also the grain of the film is so badly shown. Not really a restored print. Just a regular release. Also, where are the extras?. There is nothing here but a trailer. No how it was made no how it lasted not even commentary tracks. Nothing. 0 Extras, bad video, what else do you need. A definit buy for fans of 3d but not worth it."
4,Better than the Prequels,I liked this movie better than the first two. Not much nudity... :( haha. i thought it was refreshing 2 c the killer longer in the movie. it annoyed me that they barely showed them in the first 2. i like seeing the killers and monsters or w/e it's a lot more entertaining.It would've been a lot cooler in 3D. They need 2 get a 3D release of the DVD. That would've been cool.This also marks where Jason gets his famous hockey mask. Way better than a bag over his head.
4,good book on classical chess,This is a good book on classical chessHoward Staunton was one of the best players Europe had to offer and here he first gives you on how to play teaches the game from the beginning and then goes into opening play.This book concentrates mostly on the openingHe gives a brief history of each opening and then goes onto moves and then goes to variations and subvariatons and on and onHe even gives around 10 or more games for each opening and each variation and even explains onto what happens in the gameIt is quite interesting and develops your skill very as I dont play in USCF I cant give you my rating but it has effected my play a lotWarning:This book has descriptive notation (P-k4) so it might throw you off the trail for it did to me in firstButall in all it is a real good book and if it were to be in modern algebric notation then I would give it 5 stars
2,Dissenting Point Of View,"Contrary to other opinions posted here, which appear to me as flavors of a press release, not a very good book. An attempt to interleave fictional characters with everyday reality to construe an inspirational teaching fails because the foundation is not developed or more often because it is established on arbitrary sentimental perspectives. This book is a conglomeration of possessive infantile clichés that are prevalent throughout mass media in present day society."
5,Great plan for weight loss and energy boost!,"I was referred to this plan by my doctor and fell in love with the principles outlined in the book. I have never been a big vegetable eater and was raised on red meat. But on this plan, I was able to eat all I wanted, felt full, and immediately felt more energetic. I lost 50 lbs. in 3 months - following the plan, riding an exercise bike and doing aerobics. It was worth it! Highly recommend!"
5,Wonderful program for total health!,"Not only will you lose weight on this program, but you can reverse diabetes & high blood pressure. Know this from experience. And you don't have to be hungry (and can eat potatoes, too!). Dr. McDougall provides references to back his program up so that you can be sure it is safe to follow."
5,My fave of 98!,This has got to be my favorate release of 98. From Germany's top anti-war militants comes Execution tracks. Its FV's 4th full length release from America's prolific Metropolis records. This is very strong industrial dance music that will really get you moving! -MIC
3,Disappointing,"this book came up when i searched for books similar to wild swans, which i had read a whiles back. i thought that the title and the summary inferred that it would be short romantic stories about post war japan, but it just ended up to be a sad twisted version of aesop's fabels with incoherent asian similies. i liked it in the beginning, when there was still hope for sex to emerge in the book, but after a while, i skimmed, and quickly finished the book when it was apparent that it would keep telling the same stories over with different names and settings. Nice try, but no."
5,Fairy Cards,"When you have a question, these cards really seem to read your mind. They really hit the nail on the head, so to speak. Very insightful. The illustrations on the cards are beautiful. Attractive presentation overall."
4,Enjoy the cards.,Very happy with the purchase. The Magical Messages from the Fairies are still my favorite. I still like the cards as an added addition to my reading. I like to pick one card a day and see how much it pertains to what is going on with my life. Most times it's spot on. Hope you enjoy your cards too.
4,A fun and interesting book,"I liked this book because it's easy for the novice witch to understand. It doesn't go in depth and has a little bit of information and history of a lot of things. It answers alot of questions that a novice witch like myself is asking and it is not intimidating, in fact, Ms. bowes makes you feel welcome to try spell casting etc.. It is also entertaining and fun to read even if you aren't searching to learn more about witch craft."
3,"good subject, bad picture!","This tape contains very nice, as well as, informative subject, but the quality of the picture is poor."
3,Cellphone accessories,"The ad had a picture of a telescoping cellphone antenna. Thats what I thought I was ordering. Anyway, it was a good price on the holster"
5,No complaints!,Such a simple product that looks good and works very well!I'm using it in my bathroom to hang up wet towels. Very effective!
4,Fluffy mysteries at their best!,"This is the first Diane Mott Davidson that I've gotten to read and I was hooked right away. Similar in form to my other favorites (Dorothy Johnson, Rita Mae Brown, etc.) it took on the hokey beginnings and led their fluffy way down to the solving of the mystery, all the while the main character doesn't skip a beat with her catering.I know it sounds bad, but I honestly love these types of light and fluffy mysteries, they aren't dark and depressing, they're easy to follow without too many characters and not enough substance. I don't like heavy mysteries that get confusing within the first chapter and get wayyy too descriptive when it comes to the crime scenes or the lack of morals of some of the characters.This one in particular does seem to be a little bit too hokey in the plot (dead priests and missing soon-to-be husbands) compared to the other books, but it's forgivable!"
2,"Too Much Food, and Too Much Church","I managed to finish this book, but will definitely not read another one in this series. She's written a passable mystery, but I found too much emphasis on food and church. If you enjoy those two things, you would really love the whole series. The author is VERY knowledgeable about church affairs, and calls on that knowledge to write this series. the emphaszis on food is meant to bring humor into the book. But I don't find that mystery and humor mix very well. Also, I just could never come to like the main character (or any of the other characters, either), and therefore, never really got pulled into caring about what happened in the books. I had really looked forward to reading one of the books in this series. This was the first one I came across. It was a disappointment for me personally."
2,The recipes are the best part.,"I was very intrigued by the premise of this series but was disappointed by the writing. The charactor's dialog in this book borders on ridiculous which makes the story unbelievable. I only finished the book because I was curious to find out ""who done it."""
2,Too Hard on Her Protagonists,"D.M.D. sure seems to know her cookery, and her mysteries function all right. Having just moved to Colorado, I renewed my acquaintance with her ""Aspen"" (?) based series. However, poor Goldy and her fiancee can't even get through their wedding without a major personal disaster. D.M.D. characters don't just investigate murder & mayhem, they get tragically involved in the crimes in very personal ways. It is getting hard to pick up another book, knowing the kind of angst Goldy and her family is in for, and I probably won't. By the way, isn't it kind of hypocritical to base the series around gourmet catering and then harp on the best friend's (& fellow ex-wife's) fatness? Kind of shallow; and very seldom moves the plot forward."
3,"Good, but Tom's scribblings needed more explanation","I liked this book altho it was not your typical mystery. I had a hard time figuring out what the scribblings in Tom's notebook meant, and I don't feel that it was completely explained. Did 1049 & 1133 refer to times? What did ""B."" mean? And how about ""vdd""? Did this mean victim died at 1133? Tom reported in at 11:14 that he had a body. Doesn't body infer death? The earlier ""d.d."" meant dying declaration. So what did ""vdd"" mean? Otherwise, I enjoyed the book & I did not figure out who the killer was. It was hard to believe that Montgomery would kill Olson because of the ""miracle cure""!"
3,"Good recipes, at least","Well, I sure got tired of reading about Goldie's fiance who is kidnapped. Goldie ignores the police and too many times leads them on several wild goose chases. It was a bit monotonous when reading about the church groups and the ministers in the church. I did not think the plot was at all plausible and especially finding out who was the person responsible for the kidnapping. I do not think this was one of her better mysteries."
5,Last Suppers,"In ""The Last Supper"" Diane Mott Davidson lived up to her suspenseful reputation by putting Goldy Bear in the thick of a murder case. I can't decide which I like best, the novel or the recipes. Have used a few of the recipes from all of her books and I was impressed with them. I have been a mystery fan since I was a little girl and started with Nancy Drew books. I always try to figure out who is guilty but most of the time I'm surprised at the end. I'm an avid reader and can usually read Diane's books in 2 days. I recommend this book for light reading and enjoymentment."
2,No More Goldy for Me!,"This is it, thanks! I had started with #1, and fortunately had not bought more than four of her books. They are boring, predictable, the characters are not well developed, and the plot quite silly. Even the recipes are not for my taste. I had read the Krista Davis mysteries and was waiting for the fourth book, to be released in December. In the meantime, I decided to try another ""culinary mystery"", and was stuck with these ones. Maybe among the rest there are some better ones, but I don't want to waste time to find them. Sorry, Goldy. Goobye!"
3,Reading with Tequila,"Personally, if the priest was killed the day of my wedding, I would have took it as a bad omen. Goldy, as per usual, takes the chaos much better than could normally be expected in The Last Suppers. She was also a dealing with a kidnapped fiance that she is determined to save even if she has no solid leads and no reason to believe she is anything other than a distraction to the investigation. The Last Suppers is more hectic and frantic than most Goldy Culinary Mysteries and the emotions shown in the wake of the chaos are barely recognizable. At least the recipes, especially the Shrimp on Wheels and the Chocolate Truffle Cheesecake, sound delicious. There were some religious terms that never heard and couldn't find the motivation to look up, which isn't a good sign. It wasn't the greatest Goldy Culinary Mystery, but fans of the series will want to see for themselves what happened on Goldy and Tom's wedding day."
2,NO HELP,"I have bumps on my thighs and the back of my arms that nothing has cured, including Betamide Lotion. In fact, it seemed to make the bumps worse. The bottle says to discontinue for a while if irritation occurs, so that's what I've done. I'm not sure I should start up again. I was disappointed because the reviews indicate this product has been very helpful to some people with this or similar conditions. I had high hopes. But for whatever reason, I saw no improvement at all. The directions said to apply up to 4x daily. An expensive experiment. I'm now using Aveeno Intense Relief Repair Cream before bed, which seems to work much better. It's very thick and soothing, unlike the Betamide Lotion, which is very thin and, for me at least, actually irritating."
5,I remember the title now!!,"Okay, I've seen this movie like when I was less than 5 years old, but because I have a photographic visual memory I could remember every graphical artistic details of this movie! I remember specifically the beginning of this movie where the seals fight for their lives against the killer men. It had such an impact on me that I grew up to become an animal lover. The white seal is so cute! I, especially remember the ending too because I grew up in Florida where there were many manatees and it was illegal to harm them in any way. In the end, the white seal follows the manatee to this beautiful peaceful volcano-like island. There he knew he was safe from harm and could be in peace with the rest of the sea animals. It's a really great movie because it has a wonderful story to it. It teaches kids to become animal lovers. That's a promise."
5,Buried at Sea,This is a fairly fast paced story. A great sailing story if you like sailing and the ocean. There is enough adventure in it to to keep you interested in the story from page to page. The characters are very interesting and thats part of what keeps you reading page after page. I really liked the story and the book. Paul Garrison is a good writer if you like a book that keeps you moving!
5,A rich and wide-ranging collection,"This cookbook celebrates the culinary diversity of the Middle East with a wealth of traditional recipes from many countries. The author's enthusiasm for the dishes she describes is evident throughout, and the recipes span the spectrum from everyday meals to more elaborate preparations for holidays and special occasions. Most of the ingredients are readily available, and the food is nutritious, flavorful, and economical. Whether you are an experienced cook or only a beginner, this book has something for you.Also recommended: ""Recipes and Remembrances from an Eastern Mediterranean Kitchen: A Culinary Journey through Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan,"" by Sonia Uvezian. This seminal work captures the essence of the region's traditional foods in hundreds of distinctive recipes interspersed with superlative cultural and culinary background material, including unparalleled information on ingredients and utensils."
3,Too big,I find this pillow to be just too big! I tried to use it for a couple nights but it ended up giving me a neckache and it was also a huge pain to get in and out of bed with it during all the late night pregnancy bathroom trips! Looking for something else.
3,"BIG pillow, poor cover design","I bought this pillow to help keep me from sleeping on my back or my stomach. (I have to sleep on my side for medical reasons). I have been using it for more than four weeks now and I really like it. It is very big and I can entwine myself in it to be very comfortable and position myself correctly. BUT the cover is very, very poorly designed. It opens only at one end, making it difficult to get off and extremely difficult to put back on. Yesterday, I took a seam ripper to the top and inserted a zipper across the top. It is now somewhat easier to remove/replace. For the $50+ price tag ($25+for additional covers), they should have a better design. Some reviews say that the pillow is too full. I wish mine was fuller in some spots. I have redistributed the filling (while the cover is off), but it goes back when working the cover back on."
3,Pillow,"Everything is great with this product except a couple of things, it's hard to remove and replace the cover when cleaning. Also, the top portion of the pillow is not very soft. Overall it's a good buy for support while sitting or sleeping."
1,Not what my daughter needed,I ordered this for my daughter but it was not comfortable for her. She said it was too big. She is petite and wanted something smaller.
2,Too Big!,"I bought this pillow at 16 weeks, when I was consistently having a hard time getting comfortable at night. I wanted a maternity pillow with a lot of support and I liked the idea that this one could support by back and belly. I could not believe it when the box was delivered - it looked like I had ordered a big screen tv! This pillow is gigantic. I have a king size bed and this pillow consumed half of the bed. Being so big, it was hard to reposition in the middle of the night.Besides being big, the filling in this pillow is not nice. It reminds me of the poly fill in cheap pillows. If you are a down pillow sleeper, you may have a hard time using this for your head, which is unavoidable when it is positioned in certain ways.By the way, I bought a $20 body pillow and it works like a dream (and my husband can fit in bed with me too)."
4,Very comfortable giant pillow,"I refer to this pillow as ""the giant pillow"" when talking to my girlfriend. This thing is huge. It probably covers 3/4 of my queen sized bed. My pregnant, 5'3 girlfriend, loves it. Id order one for myself, but theres not enough room on the bed. It should really include a removable cover though."
2,No Web site Updates As Promised,"Good book on tips for kids, but ratings of rides is so-so. The biggest disappointment is the book says --- see a certain web site for updates. There aren't any updates at that website, just an advertisement for buying the book. Also, there is too much that is out of date. A disappointment there are no web updates as promised in the book. Otherwise could have been the best book out there, but without current information why buy it?"
4,Adventure Time: Jake Vs Me-Mow,"My daughter purchased this for her cousin. He didn't come over for Christmas, but I am sure he is going to love it. Especial the hat."
4,Do it.,"You're buying it for the hat don't even lie to yourself. For those of you with a bit of hair it may not come all the way down. It forms kind of a V-like shape in the back of the head it won't come all the way down tot he neck like a hat. However it is warm and soft. It may not be the best, but you're basically getting the Finntastic achievement( Finntasatic: In a lifetime own a Finn the Human hat), A cool Finnt he Human hat, and some episodes on the side. By the way the episodes are awesome too."
5,It's the hat!,"I like a lot AT, but the hat was epic! Now I feel like Finn n.n, well the dvd came in good conditions, everything was good"
1,My cholesterol got worse after 6 weeks using Cholest Off!,"First of all, my high cholesterol (averaging is genetically based, as I have a very healthy, low cholesterol diet, exercise a lot and am in superb condition (5'11"" and 172 lbs at age 56). I was on Zocor for several years, and that kept my cholesterol below 200. I wanted to get off statins and thought I would try Cholest Off. I waited until I was off statins for six months. My cholesterol hit 242. I then tried Cholest Off for 6 weeks, two tablets in the morning before breakfast and two before dinner. I just had my cholesterol re-tested and it jumped from 242 to 255! Needless to say, I am NOT a believer though I realize there may be individual variations in response to any such supplement. The fact they are not FDA approved should tell you something."
1,Warning-PHOSPHATES,"So I get the Cholestoff in and guess what? The first added ingredient is a PHOSPHATE. I'm already being treated for osteoporosis, having to take a shot a day for the next two years. At age 52, and after years of phosphate ingestion which has destroyed my bones, I by a ""natural"" product filled with poison.Bad form, Nature Made."
2,I didn't worked for me,I took it correctly during two months and the colesterol levels didn't reduce after taken the clinical exams. I don't know if I would recommend it to someone else.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I recently purchased this product and it made me sick for three days until i discontinued it. After the fact i did some internet research on the product and found that for the most part, if not entirely, it is not an effective method for cholesterol problems. I am now discussing prescription options with my doctor. Don't waste your money on these hokey pokey pills that will likely make you sick as well."
2,Defective foot pod,"hii have bought 2 heart rate monitors and foot pods from Amazon, unfortunately the last foot pod i received does not work. This is really disappointing as the logistic to send it back is huge as i am in South Africa. This is sad that suppliers do not check the items before sending them. i am now stuck with a broken unit as i have unfortunately already thrown away the packaging.regards"
1,Acupressure Facelift,"Save your money and search for something better. In this tape the acupressure technique is poorly described,the technical quality is poor, and the content is mostly dull filler by talking heads. Meredith MacRae was filmed in poor lighting and even she didn't look as attractive as she is."
1,Is this Laura Mullen the book publicist?,"I've worked with Laura Mullen, a NY book publicist. She's a great writer with a wicked sense of humor, but a horror writer/poet? What the heck?"
2,Disappointing,"I purchased ""The Warrior Elite"" and ""The Finishing School"" as a set. I was more or less pleased with ""The Warrior Elite"", but was very disappointed with ""The Finishing School"". The book was very ""wordy"" and would have been much more enjoyable if the author had written half as much and stuck to the main topic. I found myself skimming over more pages than I can remember as the material kept losing me. Unless you are a true SEAL fanatic and have to read everything you can find on the subject, I would not recommend this book. Reading it was almost like a penance for me."
5,Excellent Product,"Though it's not impossible to put this product together, it's a chore. However, once it's all done you end up with something that looks three times the cost of what you spent. I couldn't be happier at the look and quality. I even had it out in the rain and the interior was completely dry. It's a great find and definitely worth getting."
5,I have the whole line,"I read all the other reviews and decided to buy a chair and end table..... Well, four purchases later, I have the whole line. The quality is outstanding for the price. I went on line and had custom cushions made to replace what it came with (I needed outdoor cushions to withstand the elements), and I still spent less money that what I would have with some ""designer"" stores. Go for it-- you will be happy."
2,The bee has lost her sting,"Almost two-thirds of this CD are filled with uninteresting tracks that vary between the inane (Dumbo Sun, which sounds like something Roger Glover could have written) and the insane (Wilting Flower, an irritating exercise in R&B-crooning). Only ""Eyes"" stands out above the rest and reminds you of the quality of Tracy Bonham's preceding CDs. Now, ""Eyes"" can be had on ""Bee"", which was released in 2003. That CD also contains ""All thumbs"" and ""Shine"", in a less polished (in my opinion: better) version than on ""Blink"". Stick to ""Bee"" and wait for the next CD."
4,Alternative with bite...,"After giving this disc a few spins, I'm happy to say this is a solid release. I can count on one hand how many discs I own by female singers, and I was hoping that this one wouldn't disappoint. And it doesn't, for the most part. There are at least four songs on this disc that are single-worthy in my opinion, and I love the sharp lyrics, which are made easy to decipher in the included liner notes. The second track is my favorite, as it sounds like it belongs on a thriller-type movie soundtrack, but there's vocals! Recommended, especially if you liked the first two releases."
2,This clock causes more headaches than it is worth,"Maybe it would be good for travel, but as an everyday alarm clock, not. It is too small, too dark (even with the light at the top) and too hard to set without instructions. By the way, thanks to the customer who wrote the instructions below because I did lose mine and found myself in need of them. Otherwise, it looks cool and takes up very little room on a nighttable or shelf."
4,This personal atomic clock works great for me,"I have read other reviews, but to the contrary, I now have 3 of them around various places in my home, ie. bathroom, desk & now the laundry room. They all were able to sync up with the appropriate time, however gettting out of daylight saving time, one did not shift the time zone. Which brought me to buy this 3rd one with instructions. Which said to change the zone you hit mode, set (change the zone), and then mode again. Pretty easy. Then I hit recieve and we're all good. It's nice to have accuracy if that's what you're into. Nice personal clock."
3,See Instructions in images above,I attached images of the instructions above since it seems they're not available anywhere else on the web.
3,Almost no backlight,"I love the looks of the clock and it got the radio signal within 10 minutes but when it got dark and I pressed the backlight to see the time a tiny dim light came on in the right hand corner of the clock and about all you can see are the seconds. However, I still like it and will put up with straining to see the time at night."
5,Great Clock,"I got this for use in my bathroom to keep me on time in the morning. It is perfect for that. Small size, attractive. Displays date and day of week. I found the time pretty easy to set. Great value for the price!"
1,What a waste of time and money.,"This clock is supposed to automatically reset the time to account for daylight saving time. It doesn't.Figuring out the correct set of buttons to push to MANUALLY reset the time (one of the functions an atomic clock is SUPPOSED to do) for daylight saving time is impossible without the instructions.The only good thing about this clock is that it's not expensive, so I only wasted a few dollars when I threw it away."
2,Pick a genre and go for it...,"Since Michael Chabon endorsed this book and the author had won a place at Yaddo to write parts of it, I thought that I was in for a treat of a read, and yay! it was 450 pages of reading.Well, yes and no. The book has a great premise -- ganglife and a new immigrant's experiences in 1880s New York -- but it waffles between a full-fledged historical novel (like Edward Rutherfurd's works) and the second draft of a literary work. If the author had taken on one of the genres, and fully explored that rather than trying to blend the two, perhaps this would have been a more satisfying read for me. It's definitely ""readable"" but doesn't live up to the accolades on the jacket.But because I saw some moments of good storytelling and a good handle on the dramatic pace, I have hope the author's next work will be much improved over this piece."
1,Wrong info,"This book gives you wrong information about the GMAT. The book claims that each section is scored out of 60 points (it's actually out of 51). Also, the book's practice math questions cover such topics as calculating standard deviation, finding the area of a parallelogram, and analyzing data sets - none of which are actually on the GMAT."
4,exelent product recomendable,"work great pc tuneup protection exelent & much more i recomend this prod, because I use this and I install on many pc's of my costumers is my hoobie not my job but the people its hapy w/norton 360 I well try norton sistem works soon tank you symantec."
1,really awful product,"I have a masters in EE and made a very good living as a software engineer until retiring a couple of years ago and it's VERY rare that I can get this product to work at all. Terrible user interface, very unclear how to get the product to do normal functions, slows my system down immensely, .... are just a few of the flaws. Don't waste your money."
1,DONT BUY,"HA! This is a terrible program. Don't buy it. This program doesent work half as good as Norton Internet Security 2005. For now, testing this program is like taking a grenade and throwing it in the living room and wondering if the TV still works afterwords. It is a waste of money."
1,Auto Update Corrupted a Windows XP system,"I used norton 360. A month or so after installing it, it stopped my browsing capability. Completely.I couldn't launch its configuration utilities, I couldn't uninstall it. Attempting to do so would result in a process starting, but no interface ever being displayed. When I attempted to uninstall in safe-mode, it told me to reboot to normal mode and uninstall... What an idea.This product is utter [..]. I will never disgrace my system with a norton bloatware product again.If I could have given it fewer stars, I would."
1,The worst Norton Internet Security product I have ever used,"1. The backup feature is almost useless since you can only store to the root directory of a drive ( you can't specify either location or name to the backup file) so, if you have two windows partition the backup of one partition will override the fist one.2. Phishing filter is much more slower than windows filter causing your browser to be slow.3. Some unstable behavior. Once it told me product needs to be activated (while it was already activated) I clicked 'activate' it gave me error message then it became active !!4. It consumes more CPU resources than previous versions"
1,Avoid this product,"No way to right click and scan a directory ?!?No way to scan any other drives. Are you kidding me?Rewrote my hosts file without asking (ok, there is an option to disable if you dig for it) However it made the file inaccessible - cannot even change the attributes or even *read* the file. Messing with system files and rendering them useless is really not what I'm looking for.What are they thinking?"
1,YOU WILL HATE YOUR SELF IF YOU BUY THIS,I have spent the last year fighting this nightmare three times a week I have to shut down my computer because of hundreds of Norton pop ups.I spent $69.00 for tech support in english and 20 hours on the phone for a month and it still was not fixed i just gave up. Then they started sending me pop ups last week that they were going to just renew on my credit card after two hours I think i cracked the code to stop it but I DONT TRUST THEM. So I have now changed my credit card number. It may come down to me buying another computer just to make them go away.
1,When will it work properly?,"I build my own computers. That said, I have a new 64-bit dual-core processor running Vista. I have ALWAYS used Zone Alarms security, but the 64-bit system is still in beta testing & not yet available.Not wanting to risk problems, I bought Norton 360. In the 68 days I've had it, I have had to uninstall & reinstall it 3 times (per Norton) as it constantly comes up with the message of being corrupted. Support NEVER reads the problem, and just tells me to uninstall & reinstall it, like I have nothing better to do than repeating the process. Asking further questions results in receiving the same ""uninstall & reinstall"" reply, with complete instructions for doing so each time.If you're not running a 64-bit system, buy ZONE ALARMS system, NOT Norton 360. In the 5 years of use, I NEVER had issues with Zone Alarms software, which is a far better track record than I have with Symantec."
1,Fooled Again,"I had made a promise to never buy another Norton product again because of the disappointing performance and bugs I had experienced with previous versions. But I was a sucker again after reading high praise about the 360 product in a well respected computer publication. I cannot tell you how well or poorly the software performs because I cannot get it to complete the installation. Support did respond within 12 hours, but wants all kinds of information and screen shots before they will attempt to help. I had already provided them with the message and the software warned me that it was sending the necessary data as well. In order for this type of software to function properly it has to be based on the most complete knowledge and understanding of how the computer, operating system, and software works. If it cannot be installed without hours of troubleshooting and aggravation, I don't think I can expect it to do the job I bought it to do."
5,Norton 360 2008,Norton 360 All-In-One Security Annual Subscription - 3 PCsThis is a very usful tool. I used to use Norton Systemworks and read about this and thought it would work much better. It has worked much better.
2,Nortons 360,Well I think it is great that they let you upgrade to 2.0 for free if you have a 1.0 or 1.1 edition.However they get a 2 out of 5 because they don't have any support (meaning it will not install) on XP Pro x64. With today's market most people are running 64 bit OS and you can't exclude them with a product.However if you have 64 bit Vista then it will work it doesn't work on 64 bit XP Pro.
1,"Works, if you don't want to do anything else with the computer","I had the 2007 version of Norton Internet Security installed on my laptop, and it worked well. When it came time to upgrade, I thought that I'd try Norton 360. Big mistake.Norton 360 does protect your computer, so it does work. But, since Norton 360 occasionally uses 100% of both cores (while I am trying to use the computer), occasionally accesses my CD-ROM incessently for no apparent reason(until I eject it), and my computer now occasionally freezes for a few seconds, I think that Norton 360 really only works well if you don't want to do anything else with your computer other than protect it.Stay away!Update: Tech support was useless. Got escalated to 4 analysts. Each ignored the fact that my problems only appeared *AFTER* installing Norton 360. Let's see if the return policy works."
1,Stay away from Norton 360,"After installing Norton 360 my computer's performance went downhill. Boot time took about 5-9 mins, programs were slow to load and often stalled. Once I uninstalled the product, performance was back to normal. Basically this is junk."
1,Don't buy it,"I've used Norton products that worked in the past. This one doesn't. Live update is one thing that doesnt work, and also the security warnings from sites I know are ok....and the computer runs very slowly, the webpages load very slowly.I'm afraid to try anything, as most of what I have read about other folks more techie than me trying to fix their computers seems to make it go from bad to worse. It seems norton ought to be held accountable for making so many computers work poorly or not work at all.Just don't buy it."
3,Nice but clunky,"These were nice rollerblades for my daughter to use. She was really excited about the Barbie theme. She was also able to go places that she wanted to go without me having to worry about her ending face down on the floor.I didn't like the fact that they were clunky though. But considering their purpose, I am not surprised."
2,Overhyped & gratuitous!,"I am going to do my best to separate my views of this and the movie because I saw the movie first. I have usually enjoyed Mark Millar's work and have wanted to read this for quite some time. After reading the book I felt that if I was 13 years old and had never read characters swearing before I would have thought this was the best thing ever written. Being an adult however I got almost no enjoyment out of this book. While some of the characters were interesting, the entire main plot point and characters were all deplorably unwatchable and I now see why the movie changed it so much. The background elements involving an old war between heroes and villains and parallel earths was something I would have liked to read about. Sadly, I got people complaining they're bored of murdering and raping people. This was the definition of gratuitous and Mark Millar is better than this. The art by J.G. Jones was really good despite some of the stiffness in certain panels."
1,Pointless,"This book was so weak. In reading other reviews I have heard others compare this to Watchmen. The only similarity is that they are both comics. This was such a juvenille read packaged as an adult book and why does the main character look like Eminem? I just didn't get what I was supposed to take away from this book. A lot of pointless violence and profanity, no catchy lines you can walk away with. I've lost a lot of respect in millar as a writer. A great subject in incapable hands don't waste your time if your over 14."
4,Could go both ways,Millar does a great job but if you like his other works such as kickass. My only gripe with it is the vulgar language.
4,Very very very good read but the book is not the movie,"Wanted was an amazing read! I will warn though that the content is very graphic and mature; this includes language, violence (gore.), and sexual content. The book is so different from the movie that you will be either pleasantly surprised or horribly shocked because the language and violence is about 10 ten times worse.I recommend this book for comic book fans who want something more gritty and dark, people who don't like standard happy endings, and fans of the Anti Hero.If you like Watchmen, Evil Dead (and the sequels), Fight Club (and anything else by Chuck Palahniuk); you will enjoy Wanted (The graphic novel)."
1,Crappy hammer,"This thing is tiny - embarrassing to pull out of a lab coat. Way too light for a reflex hammer - you would have to use it incorrectly to actually generate enough force to illicit a reflex. The material the heads are made of is some strange hard plastic that would be impossible to clean effectively.I ordered a different hammer actually, and this one was sent by mistake, and I am quite disappointed."
2,Needs more!!!,"I got this book and read it in about two hours. I has potential as the start of something, but it was just too fast and no character development. I liked the primise of this book, but there is a lot of holes in the plot. He states that the Islamic Republic bought there military assets from old Soviet Block states with their oil revenue. But the book takes place far into the future and they don't have much left now, much less 18 aircraft carrier battle groups. The US currently has 12 carriers, but in the book, we only have 6 and when we start to reactivate ships, he uses ships deactivated over a decade ago. If you want a very quick read, this is ok, but unless he writes more, I can't recommend it."
4,Useful and hard to find,"The ""pick and pluck"" system is very useful, allows you to tailor your case to the contents.These things are not easy to find, and especially not at low prices."
3,Could be better,"I bought this light thinking it would be 10X brighter than any other led flashlight, but I think the 10X only refers to a 1 to 1 bulb comparison - not flashlight to flashlight.This flashlight only has 1 bulb, but it does light up a dark space pretty well.I did a comparison with my old standard flashlight with this one. My old light is very spotty - meaning that the center of the light is very bright, but the surrounding is very dim. This flashlight does a good job to light everything.I gave this light an average rating because you cannot focus the beam - the 12-hour battery life seems a little expensive - and it could use more bulbs to live up to the ""10x"" advertising.Overall, it is a good flashlight but I'd like to see how well this flashlight compares to a multi-bulb LED flashlight."
3,Pan,"The pan seemed great and all, but the company that makes it put their label with glue right on the inside of the pan. I couldn't get the glue off the pan and was upset cause I discolored the pan trying to do so. The price was good though!"
1,"OK, BUT...","Nice design. While the front aluminum blade is fine, the plastic shovel can break if you hit ice beneath the snow.I don't own an Artic Blast but I now I have to replace a borrowed one for a neighbor.Rudolph Hoglund"
4,"McFarlane Toys 6"" Spawn Series 29 - Spawn 9",Nice figure..Very well detailed as always with McFarlane Toys.
4,"Great sculpt, but not really a toy you can play with","As with many of T.M.P toys, the real selling point is the magnificient sculpt. Unfortunately, this means that there isn't much articulation in the figure, and is more or less a statue to display on your shelf. There are a few articulation points, notably one in the neck, the arms, and one of the legs.Spawn comes with a piece of gravel that is modeled after a New York street from where the comic is based."
3,Disappointing . . .,"Too funny! I just finished writing a review for ""Theo's Thanksgiving"" about how disappointing the ""scratch and sniff"" part of the book is and decided I would write the same thing about Biscuit's Christmas. I notice I'm not the only one who thinks so. I wish I had seen the reviews before I bought the book. The smells were so non-existent that I actually pulled off a couple of the clear round ""scratch and sniff"" stickers thinking that maybe you were supposed to do that to get to the smells. Wrong! Oh well, lessened learned! The story line of the book is still very cute."
5,Absolutely spell binding,"Something that should be read, a contemporary and informative book for all ages. Maybe should even be required reading in school"
4,The Golden Spruce by John Vaillant,The Golden Spruce was a book club choice. At first I strugged with it but as i read on i grew very interested and am glad i took the time to read it. I will never look at a tree the same (i hope).
4,Great! Love this Care Bear,"This Care Bear is the third one to come ""live"" in our home. After my 3-year-old received one as a gift, we bought her and her 1-year-old sister one each... they liked the first one that much. The Care Bear is super soft and very cuddly. It is not stiff like other Care Bears. The scent is not overwhelming at all. My youngest daughter sleeps with this bear clutched in her arms. She really loves it. The dvds are also cute. They have two 15 minute episodes, and both of my girls enjoy watching them."
3,So-So...,Not enough diagrams/drawings.Text reads like captions.Photos of poor quality.Use for reference ONLY if your a real Hitler buff...
5,It's a sex thing.,"I listened to the First Voice interview on this and was impressed by Rhoads. The book lived up to my expectations, very detailed and organized. Last time I looked the interview was still available on www.7to7.netIt's funny that the book is so organized, cause in the interview, Rhoads sounded a bit disorganized. Interesting things to say, though."
5,Good rotor,"Good quality part. Not sure if I need ""premium"", it seems heavier. It was packaged nicely for shipping.My mechanic installed it no problem. I used Wagner thermal quiet pads, together , there is no brakingnoise."
4,good for blackouts,"Just received the unit. Manufacturing quality is very good. Small, light compact design is excellent. Installing batteries is a snap; unscrew retaining knob and twist bottom cover 5 degrees to align the arrows and off it comes. Wire carry handle folds down flush with the lantern body. Very slick. Unfortunately, the brightness leaves a lot to be desired. I was looking for something I could bring up into our unfinished attic but this unit is too dim. For reading you have to have the lantern right next to the book and even then it's not really enough. This makes the high/medium/low light feature kind of gimmicky. The only use for medium/low would be as a temporary night light in the kids room. The blinking light feature is ok but the 2 second interval seems kind of long. Great lantern for very light duty camping use, blackouts or other emergencies."
5,Yaba dabba doo,"This item is great, in time for Christmas holiday, fabulous service in lightening speed.Thank you very much."
4,Ouch. Bad disc sleeve packaging.,Love the Flintstones. Have been waiting for a nice priced complete set. Unfortunately the paper sleeves for the discs WILL end up scratching the dvds. Im sure some will be scratched upon purchase . So I will get the single sets. I recommend people buy those instead. Much nicer cases and only about about $15.95 more (105.94 for all the single sets) than that the silly looking box the complete set comes in. Course Im still giving it four stars for the episodes.UPDATE: The regular sets have now been put back to their regular price of around $32. So its not so good a deal anymore. I guess you could wait for them to be on sale again or just take your chances with the complete set. Plus theres no new bonus material so the only thing your getting EXTRA is the UGLY ORANGE BOX. This set is basically the orignal six season sets repackaged. Again I think its best to wait for good prices on the single sets. The packaging is much more convienent.
5,Yabba Dabba Doo,I watched The Flintstones as a kid. I first heard of voiceman Mel Blanc as the voice of Barney Rubble. But getting to the show I liked it when I was a kid and I like it now so this is an excellent find.
2,Beautiful costumes - shoddy quality,"Amidala's costumes are gorgeous, and there is a nice blurb for each regarding the scene in the movie it comes from. However, I was disappointed in the quality of the paper dolls themselves. They are printed on very thin cardstock, and are flimsy. This will present no problem if the book is kept intact for the purpose of collectibles. If this is bought to be actually PLAYED with, it will tear up too easily."
4,Nice piece of work!,"First part of the book has various facts about bondage. Such as what sort of tools to use, how to employ different kinds of knots, and safety precautions, etc. These are useful information to the novices. Second part of the book has 19 storys from various popular S/M literatures out there, cartering to different tastes. Most of them are creatively written, these are good examples of intelletual erotica."
5,Dominoes,"Good quality product and probably the best on the market. We formed a club and play once a week on a regular basis. Whenever we're invited to neighbours, we're asked to bring it along.Puremco Double 18 Dominoes"
3,Authoritative Yet Very Choppy.,"I really find Ralph Steadman to be a very interesting person; an opinion which was shared, no doubt, by Hunter S. Thompson who provided him with a trove of faxes and letters over the course of their multi-decade friendship and professional association. The great allure of this work is that the author fills it with primary source materials which document the depression, anger, paranoia, and euphoria of the Gonzo Master, yet this is also a problem for the book. At times it is very choppy and feels more like a cut-and-paste job than a true narrative. I had to give it three stars though because it obviously illuminates Thompson's personality and it provides us with details that would be very difficult to find elsewhere. It's an important document despite its lack of flow."
3,Nice easy read,"This was a fun book, easy to read and a descent intro to the Shadowrun universe.The plot was a little thin and you could see many of the twists a mile away, but it was an entertaining read and worth a look.Overall a good book to start reading the shadowrun series and for those new to shadowrun."
5,a fine buy,"A fine trailer I got for my rhodesian. plug'n'play assembly with clever solutions to make it actually usable. Lot of windows with even clear plastic shield (removable) on the front opening, so that your pet will not get wet in case of rain. There are only two bolt/nuts to tighten and it is done. It is big, not so long but quite wide, especially when wheels are on (quick release wheel mountings). It can be folded so that it becomes a large but flat package, easy to store. What we need to test now is the resistance of the floor over time..."
1,overpriced inferior import,"the frame seems ok, but thats about all. The fabric is very thin and stitching is of poor quality.The bottom does not rest on the frame, so it is very unstable. The zippers on the mesh panels are cheap and flimsy as is the mesh itself.The wheels aren't even close to true. All zippers only open one direction as well,really limiting your options for partially opening or closing the doors. No brackets for flagpole or light.For close to $200 I expected at least some semblance of quality and care. Do not buy this!"
5,Great fun!,"Okay, I'm just going to go ahead and say this -- I enjoy a good epileptic experience every now and then, and this was about the best film out there to fulfill that urge.That aside, it was a ton of fun in other ways as well. It really hit that nostalgic sweet spot, while still being new and fresh.You have to keep in mind that it's basically a kid's movie, so you can't expect it to be too serious, deep, or realistic. It's meant to be thrilling, colorful, and even inspiring in some ways, and in my opinion, it achieves those ideals quite well."
4,Marv's review,"I wasn't impressed with the trailer of this movie, so I didn't see it at the theater. After reading some positive reviews I decided to buy the DVD and I found it very enjoyable. It definitely took me back to my younger years when I used to love watching the cartoon. I would definitely recommend it to the true Speed Racer fans!"
4,Great service,"Item came in a timely manner. It came in brand new package like advertised. And blu ray was in mint condition for the price excellent deal, thank you!!!"
4,Essential viewing for the Blu Ray format,"The film truly is visually wondrous to behold in high definition. It's flat-out one of the most spectacular films to look at from the medium's history and the editing infrastructure is highly sophisticated for a film primarily aimed at younger audiences. This will probably go down as the Blade Runner of kids' movies and by grace of time it will hopefully one day have a renaissance. Everybody whom I've screened it to have kicked themselves thereafter for passing up on the chance to see it theatrically when it was unjustly shunned by the masses. I think the animus against the film was more about some people still having a bone to pick with the Wachowskis over the Matrix sequels, the second of which I felt was grossly undeserving of such censure by the way."
1,Buying Speed Racer Supports Chimpanzee Abuse!,"People who care about animals should not rent or purchase Speed Racer. On the set of Speed Racer, a representative from the American Humane Association (AHA) witnessed an animal trainer ""in an uncontrolled impulse, hit [a] chimpanzee."" If a trainer is bold enough to strike an animal in front of an AHA monitor, you can only imagine what is taking place behind the scenes when no one is watching.Great apes are beaten into submission in order to train them for use in film, television, and advertising. As babies they are forcibly separated from their mothers and trained by being beaten, kicked, and even electrocuted. By age 8, they are too strong and unruly to be safely handled, so they are often warehoused or callously discarded at substandard roadside zoos. Many languish in small cages for decades. By purchasing the Speed Racer DVD, you're supporting the abuse inflicted on great apes who are forced into the entertainment industry."
1,i did not receive the wig and beard in the pic,if you show a picture of a product thats the one I should receive it has long bangs that are straight hair
4,Where's the rest of the story?,"I picked up After Dark in the airport while waiting for a plane that was delayed...and was thrilled to discover that there was a newly published Jayne Ann book. I did enjoy the book, but felt like it wasn't quite a complete story...is there a sequel? There were several hints about unfinished story lines, like Emmett's relationship to Mercer Wyatt being the subject of gossip. It was another great futuristic story by Jayne, my all time favorite author, but I want the rest of the story!"
3,Ghost hunters on Harmony,"This series is a hit , in the vein of the Arcane society books . A bit of paranormal action , witty conversations and , lovely characters and good action and sex . It is like an urban fantasy , for the series takes place on an industrial world like ours , with a difference . I love the dust bunnies . I hope Jayne Castle never gets around to explaining them ,I like them just as they are .I do have the feeling we'll see the whole colorspectrum in ghosts pass before long tough . I am quite pleased with the ordinary kind , the green ones . There is really no need to be too exotic . It is a fun series , nothing more but certainly entertaining ."
4,Inside moves,I love this moving when it first came out. The DVD version has better quality picture and sound then the VSH version I bought many years ago.The only thing I was disappointed in was the director talking about the making of the movie. He clams it was a special project yet he was not prepared to answer the question about the movie because he did not take the time to review his move and check his notes about the movie. It would also have been nice if they interview the actors in the movie. I enjoy the making of the movie as much as the movie it self when you can see every body in the movie knew this was something special.
5,One of my all time favorites!,"A favorite of mine because of the huge cast of wonderful characters, spot-on acting and Richard Donner's flawless directing. I'm a huge fan of horror and kung-fu movies but in the genre of drama this is one of the best. It's an emotional film but it's not all sad moments, this film has much more. It has bits of humor, romance and a life like quality that is rare in films made today. The characters have set backs and dreams and while watching I wanted the best for everyone in the film but really had no idea what was going to happen.I would compare this movie to A Wedding, an Altman film from 1978 where things are not quite what they seem and with many characters.I was fortunate enough to find a vhs copy of this a couple years ago but finally a dvd was released, don't miss it. It's a fantastic film!"
5,Great for Biology Classes!,"By tracking TB and a few other examples this video shows the process of evolution as an interactive exchange between organisms as they change in relationship to each other. It is an excellent video - along with others I have seen in this series - for use in biology classes from high school through basic college courses. This one can be used in discussions on disease or evolution. Very interesting, fast paced and Great science!"
4,Business Morality Play Page Turner,"This is one of those books I find myself reading almost obsesessively, dispite knowing how it ends. A tremendous amount of material from a wide variety of inside sources gives a ""fly on the wall"" perspective to numerous events. The writing is very readable and makes dry finance issues fairly clear.The book answers a great deal of the who and what, but not so much the how and why? What really drives this ego-maniac? Little insight is really shed on Dunlap the person, other than he is a greedy, mean SOB. Any additional insight there would further flesh out and already meaty read."
1,Crapomy,"Terrible, terrible, tried to imitate ""Snatch"", FAILED. Crap, crap, crap, from acting to plot, crap, role credits. Rip it out and burn every copy you find, take the ashes and flush them down the toilet. What a freak show of a story."
4,"Its not ""The Hangover"" get the hell over it. At least its something different.","Why am I not surprised that the people who hate this movie were basically looking for ""the Hangover"" or (lmao) the actress from freaking Gilmore Girls?Look, this is a very, very dark comedy. Very messed up, but really funny and (THANK GOD) something different. Its, not ""artsy fartsy"" as one reviewer said, it will not put you in a happy place. But, it IS a good movie with a good script. Different and disturbing, but funny if you are not an uptight, predictable baby.The fact that Zack G was marketed as the star is annoying and odd, but whatever. If you are one of the millions of people that bitch about Hollywood having no originality, give this a shot. Don't take it too seriously."
3,Deceitful Marketing - Really Good Black Comedy,"If you're looking for The Hangover, Due Date or any other formulaic mainstream comedy, steer clear..Want something that will haunt you and have you wondering about the nature of good and evil, this might pique your interest..Excellent script...excellent acting..just not what anyone looking at the DVD cover would expect.."
1,Suckfest!!,"A movie so incredibly bad, IMDb does not even acknowledge it's existence! (Go ahead, try to find it!! I went there to gather any kind of insight into why this horrible thing actually made it to any kind of screen anywhere. I still have no idea!!"
2,Not what I was expecting,With a picture of Zach Galifianakis on the cover I was expecting this to be a good comedy. I was disapppointed that he only had a small part in the movie. Rent before you buy on this one.
5,love it,I had this book before and gave it to a friend as a gift. I missed having it so I was fortunate to find another. I came packaged perfectly. Thanks.
5,The Best Cookies and The Best Service.,"My order of Ginger Snaps are always delivered on time without broken cookies in the box, this I truly appreciate.I also like the reasonably priced product plus the inexpensive shipping.Thanks A Million, Amazon."
4,Mozart Plays the Blues,"What if Mozart wasn't in that mass paupers' grave? What if he had managed to live not only to the current age but centuries beyond, even after the world had been hit by a huge meteor. That is the main plot. But there are many subplots. A sentient city, Amadeus and the sex-change, Amadeus and the lesbian nurse, wars and rumors of all kinds. The story was very good. But I think the copy I got for my Kindle wasn't cleaned up enough. For one the author repeats himself, then the Title or Author's name was there to interrupt the flow. (I read and listened to text to speech). Hopefully future editions will be much better."
3,"Silly, but Good to Pass the Time","This movie entertained me for a couple hours, but it definitely wasn't any sort of blockbuster or cinematic achievement. I was bothered the whole time by the fact that the actors look nothing like the real Will and Kate, and it doesn't seem like the movie gives any additional insight into their relationship that hasn't been excessively covered in the news. However, if you just need to zonk out by the TV with some fluff to watch that isn't absolutely terrible, just marginally bad, this might do the trick. I wouldn't recommend paying much for the privilege of watching it, though..."
3,Former Student,"It treats the major issues well, but it needs to be updated and reformed into a more code oriented format."
4,Bindis and Brides,"Bindis and Brides is the novel of Zarleena, a separated Indian woman, and Joel a mountain climbing womanizer. Zarleena has left her cruel husband and has opened a bridal shop with her sister Honey, where they are determined to make it on their own. Joel is attempting to stay faithful to his girlfriend Candy without much success and put up with with his crazy sister who lives with him. They come together in a common cause when Armin, Zarleena's husband shows up and starts causing trouble for everyone.The writing in this novel was funny and the characters entertaining. Although some parts are unbelievable this is a great summer beach read!"
4,torque wrench review,this is a good product for the money I still have not used it a whole lot to really tell how long it would last under constant use but so far so good~!
1,"Tekron torque wrench, 2432","This thing is a piece of junk! It is so bad, it is almost comical. The ratchet head will not engage in the ccw direction at all. It simply spins freely. It also disengages with the slightest amount of torque in the cw direction. This makes it completely useless. Furthermore, it is assembled backwards - if the head engaged (which it doesn't) the only thing one could torque would be a left-handed thread. Total junk, zero stars!"
1,Not worth the risk,"Decided I'd better get an inch pound torque wrench, given all the plastics in place on car engines, etc. The first 10 or so bolts this seemed to work fine, and then it was like it froze up and would no longer click when torque was reached - so now it's just a ratchet. Decided I was going to return it after working on my car yesterday (its first use), and found I was one day beyond the 30 days when Amazon would allow me to return it. Learned two lessons: one, buy reputable tools, and two, buy the tools from a source where you can get support. I love Amazon, but this deal was a mistake. The tool I got was garbage - 40 bucks to tighten ten bolts and then throw it away."
4,Good buy,Have been using this wrench for quite a while now and it works just fine. The settings marks are a little hard to read though. Calibrated it for the various torque settings I needed and it was within about 2 - 3% of what the micrometer dial said which is as good as an expensive inch-pound wrench that I compared it to. Take care of it and it will do just fine.Just wish the case had some room to store some bits.
3,Hard read,"This book is full of relevant information. This book is also written assuming that you've studied Nazism and Fascism previously. I found it useful, but hard to read. I had to look up a lot of things to make sense of anything."
4,Good but lacking some depth,"Overall a good book. But quite a lot is actually spent on ""how to tie fly x"" or on casting moves. I would have loved to see more on what angles to make sure kids stay interested, at what particular age you can do this or that, how to teach to kids of x years versus teaching to kids over y years...etc."
4,hieroghlyphics the writings of ancient egypt,for a beginner this book at first was quite daunting but on the second reading got to understand it better the book is exalent.
1,A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT !,"We have ordered these truffles in the past and thoroughly enjoyed - found them to be of high quality. We especially liked having them on hand when guests dropped by.HOWEVER, we had never ordered from this seller before and these truffles arrived melted with chocolate oozing out of the paper wraps. The bag had also been squashed so that chocolate spotted the inside of the bag. These were shipped unprotected in a plain cardboard box.The seller did not respond to our emails. Only after we contacted Amazon did they refund our payment. Never again!"
4,not bad at all,good price and it does what it saysi personally did not buy it for golf but to use it as a cheep spotter scope
2,Not For Vista!,When I read about this program and the price they were asking I was amazed. My amazemen soon turned to frustration. It is not supported by Vista. Unfortunately the price of this software was so low that it did not pay to return it. What did come through Vista was unusable but looked highly interesting. It's a shame they should've told me it wasn't for VistaPrint Workshop 2005.
5,works well for me,"i use it as a stereo amplifier and tuner with a CD player and Squeezebox, it works well."
1,EPM requires execution in a real world environment,"I have been reading Business Intelligence / Performance Management materials for more than ten years. I purchased and read this book with an expectation of finding new useful contents in it. Instead, I realized that almost all of the contents had been covered in other books previously published by other authors, in a much better way."
2,Ok...ish,"Decent story and intriguing idea, but not much effort was made to have one care for the characters and their main goals."
4,Nice CD,"I purchased this CD to use during a massage session. I would have preferred the water sounds to be a little more in the background, but it is a really nice CD to listen to. I think I'll download this into a player and mix it up with other music for a massage, though. I think the continuous sound of the waves might be a bit much for anyone who doesn't love the water."
2,Passport to Algebra,The condition was listed as used-very good with cover edges worn. The actual condtion was the binding was tape repaired and seperated from the cover. Very used poor conditon.
5,My world opened up,"I was given this book when I was about 12 years old and have read it from cover to cover many times. It really opened my eyes to the fact that science is not just about the far reaches of space and deep sea studies, but that it is all around us. It examines hundreds of different ways that science can be part of our every day life. I have since gained a Masters in Chemistry and this book was one of the main reasons factor for my interest in science."

3,Where are the mullet photos ?,When I bought this book I though it was going to be ALL about mullets... I was sadly dissapointed. I can still remember my well coiffed mullet that I sported during many a soccer game... man I was cool .
3,It's a good annex to U-Boat by Eberhardt Rossler,"I confused this book with U Boat by Eberhardt Rossler.It lists all unterseebooten and their fates and has some well written technical information about the propulsion specifically the batteries and the equipment used. It also has some excellent photographs of the diesels.The book also lists the commanders and some of the targets.It does not have plans except for a few line drawings.Overall, the book is a keeper since it has information one won't get in concise detail."
5,Priceless,"This easy to use, sweetly entertaining A-Z giude to whoe (real) food is an invaluable resource to me and my colleagues at Eden Foods. I would recommend it to the ""natural food beginner,"" and after 13 years in the natural food business I continue to learn from it too."
4,You Are What You Eat,"A must have reference for those that need to know more about what they eat and how they can maximize their nutrtional needs through the understanding of ""whole plant based"" foods,...flavor need not be sacrificed!"
5,La GES mas que un mito,"El Volumen IV del Grupo de Experimentacion Sonora del ICAIC (GES) es una leyenda y casi un mito de la musica Cubana. En Este Volumen, que es el instrumental, se puede apreciar la eclecticidad de este maravilloso grupo musical. Con musicos de conservatorio, este grupo hace un recorrido por diferentes ambitos musicales, el jazz, rock, samba, electronica y la magia de la nueva trova cubana. Este volumen es absolutamente recomendable al igual que los primeros tres volumenes. La musica de este grupo llema el alma de felicidad y es de suponerse que asi sea ya que en este grupo comenso su carrera Silvio Rodriguez y Pablo Milanes."
3,"Love the approach, but be forewarned it will affect your nursing supply","I tried to stretch my son's feedings to 4 hours when he was twelve weeks, but he couldn't do it (he was in the low weight percentiles though so maybe a larger baby could have). It was hard for about a week when he was 16 weeks, but we were successful in stretching his feedings during the day, and he was able to go longer and longer through the night. However, going 12 hours without nursing really decreased my breastmilk supply, which I didn't realize until we went to the pediatrician. I am thrilled that my son is getting through the night, and I do think stretching the daytime feedings contributed to it, but just watch your supply if you're nursing."
5,Good advice that works,Don't worry so much about pumping and measuring. This can work if you're breastfeeding. Trust your baby to tell you when they're full and when they're hungry. The important part is that you start to stretch out the time between feeding to give your child enough time to get hungry and eat a full meal.
5,A must!,"This book and author are amazing! We are currently implementing this technique for a second time with our second daughter and again are having such wonderful success! I'm not going to lie, I wondered if it was a fluke the first time around (we had such an easy baby) but with our second, it is clear that this is solid! She knows what she is talking about... and if you do not try this, you are missing out."
1,"Badly written, lousy conclusions, is she really a lawyer?","My definition of radical feminism is Camille Paglia or Susie Bright. They challenge and destroy perceptions of gender. This book is a poorly written rant against heterosexual sex written by someone who believes that tenure means never having to say you're sorry, or checking your facts or talking to real people.The best revelation in this book - porn leads to masturbating. Shocking!Read Rene Denfeld if you want to read a clearthinking feminist with a decent writing style (you'll be hurting for a decent writing style after this thing.) If you are inclined to agree with MacKinnon then read Dworkin. At least Dworkin has some great sex talk in her books."
4,Excellent book but not for everyone,This is an excellent book if you really want to understand the Constitution in extreme detail. I did and I enjoyed the book although the writing style is very wordy and long winded at times. This is not a good book for the general public but it was never intended as such.
3,"Intelligent, but pedantic","While this book offers a wealth of information about the birth of the Constitution, I found Rakove's writing style to be prohibitively pedantic. He repeats himself and has an annoying habit of posing rhetorical questions to which he offers us no possible solutions. I had to read this book for a Constitutional History class, and although I understand why my professor assigned it, I think Rakove could have written this book in 200 pages, rather than 450. I guess I might as well come out and say it. Its boring. The subject matter is fascinating, but the way Rakove presents his thesis lacks something to be desired...."
4,"Good book, great information, not well written","This is an excellent book, the information and insight contained within is excellent. However, while it is apparent the author is an extremely intelligent historian, he is just as clearly not a great writer. Thus, the reading is slow going, but if you are interested in the founding of the US Constitution and the debates and desires of the founders, this book is a must read."
5,A Great Diana Tribute,A wonderful re-issue of a book celebrating Princess Diana. Great pictures and stories about her by those who knew her & travelled with her. A must-have for Princess Diana or English Royalty afficianados!
2,Rust and Discoloration,"You're definitely getting what you pay for when you buy this. Even though I made sure to wash them right away and thoroughly dry them, these pans rusted like crazy. They also discolor easily. The only thing good about them is they're really cheap."
1,Defective Duo,"I've tried three times to get this CD duo, but there is a problem with the second CD in all three sets. It doesn't appear to have anything burned onto it, as every player I tries cannot play Disc Two. I enjoyed the first CD but have had to send this back for the third time. I give up."
5,Love love love this show!,"Watched it during the holidays 'cos I was bored and there was nothing to watch on TV. Was instantly hooked. So entertaining and I just love all the dancing - not just ballet, but hip hop, tap, and jazz too. The actors are really good at acting and dancing. Definitely not your typical cheesy/predictable dance show. Blazed through season 1 and 2. Can't wait for Season 3!"
5,Please contact ABC to bring the show to America/DVD,"I found this show on Netflix, looking for a dance movie, wow, I LOVE this series. Why can't America make a kid friendly dance show like this. Here is the information to write the Producer of this show. We need to show them we are interested, at the very least, make the DVDs in our format. [...]"
5,Great shoe!,"Very sturdy, held up well over 8 months (DS grew out of them before they wore out, always a plus!) and very comfortable. DS LOVES Stride Rite shoes!"
5,This is a great book.,Jaclyn Lurker has created a book that is very entertaining. This is one that I could not stop thinking about. I had to read this book every spare second I had because the suspense was killing me. I really enjoyed it and cannot wait for further books by this wonderful author.
5,awesome game,I didn't care that the game didn't come in the box. The price was great. Its hard to find theses games when you don't have time to be shopping around in stores. Happy to have found it here.
3,Mario Party Advance is for for older children,"If buying for a child, be aware the child must be able to read to use the game."
4,Very well done,I always loved the PBS Empire series and this was no exception. This show tells a great accounting of the Holy Wars that were so long ago. It has great info and in depth coverage on what happened between these two great leaders in a time of death and chaos. If you are a fan of the Holy Wars or just ancient civilizations and battles this is a must buy for you.
1,Below Average,"I have been an Amy Grant fan since 1977. This work is not one of my favorites. There is nothing to distinguish this collection of hymns from the literally hundreds of similar recordings by other artists. Amy has a distinctive and pleasant voice when she's in her element; sadly she's out of her element here. This recording has Vince Gill's fingerprints all over it and, although he is extremely talented, I don't care for his style of music; it just doesn't mesh with Amy's style. I am hopefully awaiting her next album."
1,Marketing Scheme,"Growing up I was a HUGE Amy fan....and stuck with her through all her changes, ups and downs but as for this album I have to give it a big thumbs down. The music itself is very country/bluegrass style. Amy talks about in the album liner notes how this is such a heart felt project for her and yet in listening to the songs I hear no such emotion or heart. It is just Amy going through the motions. All songs seem rushed and sound recorded with little effort or concern. I don't hear or feel the amazing messages that these songs hold.If you ask me and I hate to say it but I must...I believe this album is all part of a big marketing scheme. Get Amy's old Christian audience to accept her again with ""Legacy"" and the recently released ""Her Greatest Inspirational Songs"" album in hopes that in September when her new ""pop"" album hits the shelves it will be a success and she will have mended fences with all her fans."
2,"Great Idea, Bad for your bicycle...","The little dog loves this basket. She is comfortable and has never tried to jump out. Be aware that carrying weight in this location will affect your steering and handling.The basket is well constructed but has a terrible flaw: There is a strut that rubs against the steering tube when you steer the bike left and right. It will quickly rub the paint off of your bike, then will rub against the metal. The manufacturer says this, ""We think the best solution is to wrap the part of your steering column that rubs against the strut with some kind of adhesive bandage, such as ""moleskin"". Later when you remove the bandage, you can remove any traces of adhesive from the bicycle with a solvent.""This is not a solution to their design flaw. This basket has damaged my wife's expensive bicycle."
5,Life in Focus,"Fr. Behrens possesses the unique ability to bring life's ""little"" moments into focus so that we can not only relate, but also ""see"" God's hand in our lives. It is a peaceful, yet stirring, collection that encourages thought and laughter and insight into our own lives."
5,Great Book!,The book we received was is great condition considering its age. The story was very intriguing and we were surprised how it ended. We really enjoyed it. Thanks!
3,So and so,"I have bought this item by the web on Amzon, unfortunately this book is thought for children not for adult. So I'm not fully satisfactory.By the way, it's quite integresting, good images."
3,Backup Pair ONLY,"We purchased these cuffs so my husband, who is a police officer, could have a spare set. Unfortunately we didn't realize they don't use a standard cuff key so for training these were useless. They're also somewhat pointless to have since my standard key won't work with these since carrying around an extra set of keys isn't always practical. Otherwise, these are well made and a good set of cuffs."
3,police detective handcuffs,i thought these cuffs had a cool look to them but when I read one of these reviews the author said that these handcuffs dont use the standard key? is this true and why wouldnt they use the standard key?
2,The Buffer did't work,I purchase two sets of speakers and one of the sets was defective the buffer did not work. I called the technical service depatrament and you have to wait to get a number and return the defective set. I am still waiting for the call now is more than a week since I reported and no call at all. The set that did work sound is very good
4,What About God?,"The movie explains both sides to the controversy, which is were humans created by god or that humans evolved from a lesser animal. The movie explains both sides very well with a number of interviews from both sides. The movie does not push either side one the viewer which is very hard to do. The movie gave very accurate information about both theories and did not make one theory seem less than the other. The movie also interviewed many students faced with the decision between the two theories. It showed several interviews of people who attend Wheaton College and are struggling to make the decision. The film also showed students from Jefferson High school that believed that Creationism should be taught along side Evolutionism. The film did not change my mind in what I believe, but it did enlighten me to other ideas and why other people believe those ideas. I would recommend this movie to be shown in the classroom. I think it would enlighten other students too."
2,Not very descriptive.,"This book would be very confusing to someone who didn't already know Hsing-I Chuan. It doesn't describe any of the basics at all, and there are arrows and lines going everywhere which confuse you even further. If your a collector, this one will probably be out of print soon so buy it. Thsi book was designed to give an overview og\f the art, not to impart anything of much value to the reader."
2,Eh,"Quite frankly I can't even remember much of this movie, which means it wasn't that good. They show all the funny parts in the previews so if you've seen the previews you've seen enough."
3,"Not great, not as bad as all that.","I was nervous about watching this with all the negative reviews but I enjoyed the previous movies so gave it a try. The story is fairly predictable and some of the characters are not very deep. This is especially true of Jessica Alba's character (she did a good job, there was just nothing to work with for her character). She plays a very one dimensional drug rep who coaxes Ben Stiller's character into promoting a new ED drug. Overall, I think they stuck with the formula that worked for the first movies but it is getting a little over done. I did laugh several times in the film but mostly you smile at some of hte scenes. In the middle it does drag out a bit and again, is fairly predictable. However, that said it is overall a solid comedy and worth a rental-not so much on the buying in my opinion."
1,MY HUSBAND DRAGGED ME,MY HUSBAND DRAGGED ME TO THIS TRIO OF FILMS AND I COULDN'T STAND ANY CONTRIVED ONE OF THEM! AND THE ACTORS ALL PHONED IT IN.
3,So so movie,This movie was a little disappointing. The first 2 movies in this series were alot funnier. I really expected more!
4,Good!!!,"This was a pretty good movie in my opinion. I always was been a fan since the first movie of the series. But, I still think the second movie was better. But, they did a nice job with the third movie."
2,"Too many sequels, I guess","After seeing the first and the sequel, I expected the third to be as good - it felt like they were trying too hard.The parts which were supposed to be funny fell with huge ""thuds""... Tried to laugh, but wasn't much to laugh about."
1,Horrible!!!!!,"It had the same jokes, weak plot, hardly any on screen time with the little kids. Overall, a movie that should have been made way better or never been made what so ever! very disappointed!!!"
1,Don't say a word,"There is double pleasure in reading a book then watching a well made movie. In most cases, movies are no match for the journey of a book. Reading a book, you are only limited by your immagination while a movie is a specific visual expereince.In this case, the book was poorly and superficially plotted compared to the movie. This book is an abosolute boardom drawing shallow and superficial plot scenarios. The movie modified the shallow and superficiall book scenarios into intelligent, believable, and suspenseful scenes. Don't read the book, see the movie instead."
5,AWesome bags,I started a cupcake business earlier this year and needed an easier way to frost without having to clean all the bags out afterward. These bags work PERFECTLY!
1,Trying too hard to be unusual.,"Trying too hard to be unusual.The photos are often of grotesque subjects (lots of gargoyles); taken from weird locations or at strange angles or too close up (never show the whole building); lots of telephoto-distorted perspective; almost all overcast weather. Overall, very unattractive, distant, and cold.Text tends to focus on less-salubrious aspects of the city's history.A commercial street map that doesn't show all of the city covered by the book is reproduced on the last two pages. No index to the map or cross-references between map and book.This is a book that was ""produced"" -- not a labor of love.By the way, I really like the photographer's book on English villages -- it is just the opposite."
3,not my favorite k-cup,"I'm drinking this coffe right now, and I have to say it's not my favorite. To me, this coffee has a bit of a burnt espresso aftertaste. Timothy's brand has a Sumatra which is very bold but smoother than this one. Unfortunately for me, I still have another box of 25!"
2,It's tipsy,I'm very disappointed in Rick! It is unstable and if you breathe too heavily this suitcase falls over. I also purchased the tote which I absolutely cannot fit my lap top in. I wish I could return it but I found out about the flaws too late.
4,Get of the couch,"You can take medication for osteoporosis but you need to get off the couch too. Working out and keeping your body active is what this book is about. No you do not have to be a workout fanatic. No the exercises are not too hard. This book helps you to build bone density and muscle strength with easy to follow exercise pictures. If you do have osteoporosis these exercises can help ease some pain too, plus you get moving and find yourself having more energy. Another plus about this book is it improves your balance. When you have osteoporosis you are especially concerned about falling and breaking a hip. I personally like this book because the workouts are easy and it has helped me improve my energy."
2,Lavoisier in the Year One has no chemistry,"After thoroughly enjoying Obsessive Genius I eagerly ordered this book in the Great Discoveries series. A thorough disappointment. I finished it with great effort. The writing was disorganized and muddled.The author apparently is a fiction writer. This book reads like a weak thesis paper. I came away from it with an appreciaition of his accomplishments, although not totally clear, but no strong feelings about LavoisierKoz"
3,Just Ok,I purchased this book for a Library Science class. It was kind of boring and it seemed like you can learn most of the info on your own although I did learn a few new things.
2,I wouldn't purchase for any other reason.,"This book did not really explain the necessary info, but since I needed it for a course I bought it."
4,Parliament backrooms,"While agreeing with the appreciation of the singing expressed by other reviewers, I would like to add a defence of the staging. I think the setting is a lobby or back stage at the Houses of Parliament, where the MP's gather before and after meetings. Then it all makes sense, with Gruberova, as another reviewer has said, a stunning combination of Queen Elizabeth II and Margaret Thatcher."
2,vista-to-vista works poorly,"I tried PCMover in a move from a Vista32 machine to another Vista32 machine, and was pretty disappointed. It did a good job with superficial stuff like wallpaper and bookmarks- but only a few of the applications worked after the move. Some particularly important software, such as my printer drivers, would not work, and would not re-install, even after a full uninstall/clean/re-install cycle. It failed every time with an obscure error in some DLL file. Since it mentioned VC80 libraries, I tried to install the Microsoft VC compiler straight from Microsoft- which wouldn't install either. When standard MS off-the-shelf sw cannot be installed, it told me the computer was pretty confused. I ended up re-formatting and re-installing from scratch.Overall, it was a wasted effort. I really wish someone could solve this (apparently very difficult) problem!"
1,DO NOT WASTE MONEY!,this software moved over things that it shouldn't have and caused compatability errors!!!it made the CDrom drive disappeari had to undo everything and start over with a flashdriveWASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Don't buy it!,"Don't buy this. I thought it would be quicker to use this program to move files, but it corrupted my system files on my new Sony Vaio computer. So, it would have been faster to copy and move files manually than to still be having problems 10 months later. Thanks to this program, I now have to copy all my data files and perform a full system recovery."
1,It crashes every time,"I haven't been able to get it to work successfully. It crashes on my ""old"" computer as it attempts to transfer the files."
1,A Waste of Time & Money,"It transferred the applications and data I requested; and nothing worked. I'd have been better off just doing fresh installs on everything, which is what I'm going to have to do after I undo the mess this highly overrated (in my opinion) and overhyped product made of my new PC. Their ""Technical (lack of) Assistance is worthless. It's obvious I was calling somewhere in India and the individual was rude, condescending and no help whatsoever."
1,Too flimsy,"My model has a ""tab"" that is supposed to hold the lock in place, but the material is too flimsy. One time on fast deceleration to avoid a deer, the lock turned with the throttle, and the ""tab"" then pushed on my starter button and turned off my headlight. Not a good situation while trying to avoid the deer. Took me a while to realize what had happened. I do not recommend this product."
1,I can't see...,"Okay, I just received this book and was excited to read it, but first I have to go out and purchase a magnifying glass. Why is the type so damn small in this book? or at least in the copy I received, this is ridiculous."
3,Happiness Hypothesis,"Content is good, but written in a very academic style and not easily readable. A good read for professional psychologists or other counselors."
3,"Interesting book, not much new...","I enjoyed this book a little bit, but I found that for significantly long sections that the author either deviated into niches of his research too narrow to contribute to his ultimate objective. Between that distraction and the fact that there's just so much in here that's either not new or too obvious, I decided to rate it a 3. This book was by no means revolutionary or life changing for me as some of the reviews seem to indicate, but to each his own."
3,Good resource but somewhat directionless,"It's impossible to summarize one's life work (this book) in a short review, but so be it. Haidt's book is pointed to by many as the definitive book on happiness. He draws on the full history of psychology as well as many religious traditions and aligns common threads with research. The book is expansive in its coverage and to the interested reader, offers many launching pads for further reading.Written by a Jewish Atheist, Haidt moves beyond antagonizing those who's beliefs he disagrees with, which is so common in current writings. Rather than defining them as irrational, he considers why psychology can explain the different perspectives and how they contribute to happiness. This book does not try and cannot answer the deepest questions of life. It's good to see the different perspectives. Read because it is a good resource for many of the contained topics but search elsewhere for how to live."
5,Want to Know What Makes You Happy,"Our book group just finished this book. This is a scientific look at what makes people happy. It's intelligent, historical, easy to read and covers a wide range of activities that help individuals pursue and find happiness. There are a few leaps of logic that may be questioned by philosophy students, but overall the book is outstanding."
2,"Too long, too academic, and going nowhere.","Forget this book. It's an interesting premise - exploring the great minds of the past to find a formula for modern happiness (ie. nothing is new under the sun - ""the ancients understood what really mattered in life""). But it drags along making the same point over and over again for almost 300 pages. It could have been written in less than 100! Spend your time on another book."
3,Musings of a college boy,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of David Brooks, the New York Times columnist. It was on the list of books he recommended in his column about how ""we"" need to change how we think (and act) in this world. (Which I agree with wholeheartedly.)In any case I purchased this and another of his recommendations, Michael Gazziniga's The Ethical Brain. After perusing the Gazziniga book I decided to start with the Haidt. I regretted his choice of the title, after all, what can be more fleeting than ""happiness""?I persevered through to the end. It had a few bright moments, no, instants; but it was basically the musings of a college boy. It seem so full of ordinary, everyday information and nothing worth note. It's a mystery to me why anyone would recommend it.I am giving it three stars after reading the review from 'a reader in front of the front range'. I figured if he gave it three stars, I should be as generous - otherwise, I was tempted to assign only two."
5,Great book very enlightening,"The book gives a very detailed account on happiness from many different view points. It picks apart old and new aspects of happiness theories and puts them together in a seamless hypothesis. From how happiness is only a chemical reaction with in our brain, to how we need to have social connections to achieve greater happiness,the book goes into great detail on many of these conditions for happiness.Myself, personally I have taken the advice from the book and used it in my life.I now know that to achieve happiness I can follow many different paths but with the guidance of the happiness hypothesis, the paths I take will be more fulfilling and rewarding. Highly recommend this book to people that are both happy and unhappy, you will not be disappointed. The insights you get are super helpful to understand how to make other people and yourself happy, especially if your stuck in a hole and can't seem to find a way out of it."
5,A thorougly enjoyable read,"This book approaches happiness from many different angles (self, interpersonal relationships, community, etc.). Rather than serving as a self-help book, the book uses theory and research to describe the factors associated with happiness. This is done in an easy-to-understand manner. As such, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I highly recommend it to others interested in learning more about this topic."
4,Opens your eyes....,This book is a great read. Great insight and philosophically awakening. I was assigned to read this for a class I'm taking but found myself taking the time to really ponder the words and looked forward to reading it.
5,Want to know why everybody seems crazy except you?,In this delightful series of essays that marry ancient wisdom and up-to-the-minute social psychology Jonathan Haidt explains why people aren't who they pretend to be...why they can't control themselves...why they would rather fight than switch...why you can't please some people...why everybody has a better opinion of himself than everyone else does...why promoting self-esteem is dangerous...why you can't buy happiness...why most people shouldn't be trusted...and a hundred other conundrums that aren't puzzling at all once you read this book. It's all presented with the clarity of great teaching and the charm of masterful storytelling. You even learn some new ways to manipulate people if you're into that kind of thing.
5,Great,"The product is great. When they say to use a bucket under the water the first time you turn the water on, you should. The first blast of water clears the filter for first use and the water comes out black for a few seconds. I had to clean the shower. My hair does seem softer, I am glad I purchased this item."
5,a friend of Janes,"I have read each and every book of Jane Duncan's at least twice and can voach they are my favorite book series. So enjoyable, I could identify with the Janet Sandison charactor. I will continue to reread these as long as I can see. You must buy them though to pass on to your children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. My family Watson come from Northern Scotland."
3,athletics vs. musicality...,"This is a great dvd for a youngster learning about technique and chops and how to ""smoke"" other drummers with your licks. But if you are an older 21+ musician who believes in the music first, you might not be too impressed. There is nothing wrong with the approach Lang has; he's creative and original in many of his ideas, I just wouldn't recommend too many of these licks while you're playing onstage. The guitar player might turn around and say ""what the F#@% are you doing!"""
3,"Works Well, Light Ruins It","We purchased this humidifier about a year ago. It works well and runs quietly. However, I wanted it for use in our bedroom without realizing that you can NEVER turn off the glowing blue light that comes on when the unit is in use.Works well, but don't buy this for your bedroom. You'll regret it."
1,Fine except for when it's not,"Bought one from Home Depot and it broke in a week. It stopped producing the mist, and only blowing dry air. Returned it and got another one, it worked well for a season. Pulled it out this winter and the same problem occurred. I don't know what I did wrong, cleaned it regularly and all. Who knows, I just know it's a pain having to buy a new one each winter."
3,Its OK,"I bought this unit for my kids room and it seemed to work so well and very quiet but for some reason it kinda produces this white sorta dust and its everywhere in the room (furnitures, electronics...TV and stuffs) and its a pain hard to clean. I'm not quite sure if its good to be enhaled especially for kids."
3,SPD DELTA MORPH,"THIS WAS A REALLY BIG LET DOWN ALL IT IS ,IS A SOFT PLASTIC SWORD WITH A REAL BIG NAME."
3,Good Value,"I found it somewhat disappointing that the video gives no direction in methods of obtaining sounds similar to those of the original Beatles recordings. Despite this shortcoming, for guitarists hoping to learn how to play some of the better-known licks of the Beatles, this video gives a broad sampling for far less than the cost of an hour of professional instruction. I found it to be of good value."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Phone loses connectiosn often.Phone does not store usage information. Requires connecting and minutes to get usage.Does not show all call history. Only most recent from a particular number. No details as to call length stored.Camera is almost useless unless you subscribe to the picture plus service so you can send pictures to people ($15/month). Can not download pictures not taken on the phone. Quality of photos pretty weak. If you upload a photo and later download it, it is too large to use as a caller ID image.You can download ringtones or games but have to pay for them and only get them for 30 days, or they rebill."
1,Battery doesn't stay charged!,"The guidebook for this phone gives me 3 hours talk time and 7 long days of standby time. Well, it's been about 2 days, with one phone call made, and no other actions done, and the phone is dead! This is the second phone in a row with this exact problem, so it's not specific to this unit. This is crazy. I'm going to another brand."
4,Nice and Forgiving Sweater,"I am usually very reluctant to buy clothes online because it is difficult to discern how well they will look or hold up. However, based on other reviews, I took a leap of faith and bought both the red and teal sweaters because I was very busy and unable to get to the mall. The red sweater looks very nice and does a nice job of ""hiding"" the extra pounds I put on during the holidays. It is very soft and warm. The small sparkles along the neck line are a nice touch that make it suitable for dressier occasions. I have washed it a few times and while it still looks OK, it would hold up better if treated as delicate."
5,Nice Sweater,"Just Love it. A very easy and comfy go to item that matches anything, Looks great for casual or dress."
4,"Litter Mat Works, But It Is A Bit Expensive ...","Looked around for a litter mat for a while, but everything I found was small. I finally found the Purr-fect Paws Litter Mat. It is huge and does the job pretty decently. Naturally, it does not catch everything, but it does a better job than the smaller mats that I have tried. However, I must admit, if I did not have a $20.00 gift card from Amazon, I am not sure I would have paid $29.19 for the mat plus an additional $4.49 for shipping. The mat works, but is expensive, hence the reason for only 4 stars.."
5,Great Resource,"I've been too intimidated to read the bible in the past, but this book is helping me tackle a seemingly difficult task."
3,Reviewing the One Year Bible,"I was a bit disappointed in the condition of the Bible I received. The outside was not in very good condition and the cover looked faded like it had been in the sun.However, the inside pages seemed to be OK. I have a friend that had ordered the same item for herself and her mother and didn't pay as much. Both of her's came back looking like new."
5,The One Year Bible NIV Large Print,I purchased this Bible for my 92 yr old grandmother so that she could read the large print. She has been more than pleased & is about 6 weeks ahead on her daily readings. When the elderly have difficulties with their sight & hearing it is a joy to know that there is a service that can provide for them....thanks Amazon!
4,I enjoy this Bible,"This Bible makes it easy to stay on a one year reading plan. Language is very clear and concise, making it a great purchase for beginners."
5,Goes where I go.,"Have read through the Bible every year from some time, but would miss days when I traveled because my paper copy was heavy and hard to read on planes, trains and automobiles. It has its limitations (no substitute for a hard copy you can thumb back and forth through), but for what it is designed to be, it is great!"
4,The One Year Bible Premium Slimline LP NIV,"I like the idea of through the Bible in a year with it arranged for me rather than having to follow a seperate guide. It is taking some getting use to reading the New Testament in the front of the book. I am a little disapointed in the large pring size, i was expecting larger large print."
5,LIKE WINE HE GETS BETTER WITH TIME,"THIS IS ONCE AGAIN ANOTHER GREAT ALBUM FROM GENE. HE IS LIKE WINE HE GETS BETTER WITH TIME. IN MY OPINION HE IS THE GREATEST SINGER OF ALL TIME IN COUNTRY MUSIC. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REMAKES THAT ARE BETTER THIS GO ROUND. THE NEW ARE JUST AS GOOD. I ONLY WISH COUNTRY MUSIC WOULD GO BACK TO IT'S ROOTS AND STOP ALLOWING ""POP"" AND ""ROCK"" AND CALLING THAT COUNTRY. GENE IS A CLASSIC. GREAT ALBUM. MUST BUY FOR TRUE ""COUNTRY"" MUSIC FANS!!!!"
5,LOVE IT,I love this book! I take it with me whenever I am scrapbooking. I can't wait to get volume 2!
4,"What, no Johnette?",The simplicity of the keyboards at times contrasts greatly with the driving percussion. A contrast befitting such a creepy film. I do wish the producer would have seen fit to include the end title track. I do not hear enough of Johnette Napolitano.
4,Product Review,"These Speakers are very good speakers. Their very easy to put up and install. Their sound qualities are excellent. I wouldn't put a lot of power into them, probably no more than 10 to 20 Watts per channel.Considering these are ""outdoor"" speakers, overall I rate them excellent in overall quality, workmanship, ease of installation especially their audio connections.I installed them under an eve of our garage. I don't know how they will hold up under a full rain shower however. They won't get wet where I installed them. They just look too good to be installed fully where rain might get them wet."
1,Come on!,The game is too hard. After I completed practice mode I went to my first battle. The guy is hard to beat. Come on! The attacks you use are dull. Seriously! Do not buy this game! This game is worth 1 dollar!
3,Good book for VLSI,"This book reflects changes in the technology and trends in the industry. Covering CMOS design from a digital systems level to the circuit level, and providing a background in CMOS processing technology, this book includes both an explanation of basic theory and a guide to good engineering practice. The material is of use to designers employing gate array, standard cell or custom design approaches."
1,this [stinks],this album couldnt be any worse. if blink breaks up over this album i have given up on everything.
3,mediocre,"No surprises here... sounds like Blink 182. If you like that band, this release will probably have a happy home in your media player. All the comparisons to Fugazi and Refused are completely unwarranted and undeserved, IMHO, since this is pretty pedestrian stuff that breaks no real ground."
1,It hurts my ears...,"I have not listened to the entire album, and never will. Why am I being so closeed-minded to what could be good music? Because I know crap when I hear it. All summer long, the video for ""I Feel So"" has been in heavy rotation on MTV2, drilling that annoying song into my subconcious whenever I channel surf. The band tries to be ""hardcore"" on that song by playing adjacent NOTES (not chords) on severely downtuned guitars, it tries to be ""punk"" by having a catchy chorus, and the supposedly ""dark"" lyrics make it ""emo."" My verdict: listen to Far, Sunny Day Real Estate, or even AFI if you want some ""hardcore emo."" All of those bands write songs with REAL emotion, and don't play any boring riffs. And if you want to hear some downtuned guitars, check out Will Haven, the ONLY band that doesn't abuse alternative tunings. Trust me, all those bands are great. This is about as bad as it gets."
1,punk??,"These guys are all from blink, and from that you know theyre all sellouts, and not punk..the only good part about this band is the [guy] on the bass, he's decent. The singer sounds like a little girl.If u want some real good voices and screams check out linkin park or nirvana. check out The Ataris if u like blink style music, but with much better vocals, The guy actually sounds like a guy..."
3,Blink Cover band did good,"when i got yhis cd i was expecting a pop-like punk (aka blink 182) but i was suprised to hear songs like ""letters to god"" and ""all systems go."" there still is a good bit of sappy love songs with a pop taste but all in all it is a damn good cd for a angry night"
2,Ugh,"There are some highlights to this album, certain songs are good, but none are 'punk' i dont know what you people are talking about that refer to this music as punk rock. Check out The Exploited and AFI if you want to claim to punk rock. I hate this album."
4,awesome cd.,"this cd was really great. a lot like blink182's new cd (2003). i agree with some reviewers that theyre missing mark, but i think a lot of the time he gets all the glory and that tom and travis get to hold the spotlight for a while in this cd.although i really like this cd, i think i prefer blink182 better. this kind of soft punk (does that make sense...?) is nice to listen to, its sometimes a bit too ::deep:: for me. i like blink182s songs before their newest album better, with songs like ""the party song"" ""roller coaster"" ""story of a lonely guy"" ""dammit"" and ""reckless abandon"".however, this cd is great for people who didn't really like blink in the first place, and is also good for blink fans who need a little change in music."
4,Better than Blink,"I have to give it to BCR, they definitely take their music seriously. Their songs depress you, and move you, and rock you all in the same album. The single ""I Feel So"" shows most of what the album is about, dark and depressing, excluding the song ""My First Punk Song"" which is basically 1 minute 4 seconds of Blink 182."
4,Good album,"Here it is plain and simple. If you like blink-182 then you will like this album. If you do not like blink or any other band associated(ie:+44, Transplants, Angels and Airwaves) with blink then chances are you won't.This album has a raw feeling to it and is not as processed as other blink albums. This is probably some of Tom DeLonge's better work."
5,Beautifully illustrated Lalique Glass book,"This book shows the beauty of Lalique Glass. Mr. Dawes has written and illustrated the magnificent features of each piece so the reader can see the delicate details. Even if a person is not acquainted with Lalique Glass, it is a special pleasure to look at each and every piece that is shown in the book. It is a true collectors book."
4,Good,"Easy to take, moderate response. Nothing bad, but couldn't tell much otherwise. I presume it helped, but just couldn't tell. Maybe one dose is not enough, at least for me."
2,"Does increase energy and would have made me lose weight, but I had problems","This product really did enhance my energy levels and increased my mental stamina. I think it would have definitely helped me to extend my workouts as well.I can't really say I like it however. I had to stop taking it after the first day. It caused unrelenting nausea and vomiting starting within an hour of taking it and lasting for the next 10 hours. Although that nasty side effect would have caused weight loss over time, I doubt that it was intended to work that way. Hopefully, my sensitivity to the product is rare and few, if any, other users will have the same difficulties."
2,Stimulex,This product left me non dowries. However I didn't feel any more energy then take a vicks dayquill pill. I tried this product for free via the company but am not going to buy! You can find a lot of free products out there to try before you buy to see if their worth your money. via [...]
1,Not impressed,I was not impressed at all by this product. I did not notice any difference while taking it. My appetite was not affected at all.
2,Lots of energy/angina pain,"I been using product now once a day for a week with good amounts of energy but had to visit my doctor today because of a spell of angina heart pain yesterday and today. I'm exhausted and layed in bed the whole day because the Doc says ""this added boost also consumes your bodies stores of vitamins, nutrients, elecrolytes"". So I doubled up on a daily dose of B50 vits and a multivitamin along with lots of water. I'm starting to feel normal. I won't use this product anymore."
3,From what I could tell it works,"One little sample isn't enough to see any results as far as the fat burning goes. I did feel some energy after taking Stimulant X, although I'm not sure if it's because I wanted to feel it or because it works. If they gave at least 3 days worth, if not a week's, a better and truer review could be given."
5,AWESOME,"This stuff was great. I have used lots of different OTC energy pills, and have had most all the jitters and heat flashes. These pills kept me energized and focused without any of the shakes. I really enjoy them."
4,An Honest Look at the Role of Trust in Organizations,I was not expecting to like this book and was pleasantly surprised. The book provides real examples and a model for working on personal change with executives. It is does a good job of showing the impact of a lack of trust within the organization.
5,new era for opera,"This opera is so 'real'! I think that it is an astonishing achievement to be able to make opera so vivid. It is 'alive'. The formalities and stiffness are all melted into 'today's' world. No soul can watch it without loosing the line between imagination and reality. I would categorize it as an evolution in opera productions. Anna Netrebko is injecting a revolutionary approach to opera. It involves a genius to turn the opera into the new dimension. I am absolutely astonished by the 'realism'. 5 stars are not enough!It takes a visionary to understand that this performance. When Tchaikovsky played his First concerto for the first time, he was laughed at. It is not for everybody to see through the eyes of the `establishment' how genius this production is."
4,Chilling and funny,"How often do you get to put together the words chilling and funny? But this book is both and does it well. It enmeshes you so deeply in Belfast, during the Troubles, than when you look up you eye everyone to see if they are IRA or British soldiers. I was amazed by the author's control over voice as perspective shifts from the protagonist to other characters and was moved by the horror that is drawn so well by the young voice recounting it. Every Brit and every Irish American should read it to discover and uncover the not-so-secret secrets of the Troubles that we all scoffed at. There was nothing to scoff at. The ghosts come back to haunt you."
4,Pretty damn good,"The tracks with vocals are skip-able, and there's a bit of filler, but overall excellent album."
3,"Whisper quiet, powerful Hunter fan, not durable","Hunter fan is whisper quiet. So much better than the old fan. Sometimes I can't tell if it's running. And this Hunter fan is powerful. It quickly clears the steam out of the bathroom. I have less moisture, quiter operation, and I can run it for shorter periods of time so I save money, too. This Hunter fan was a good investment.Update: After only 9 months my Hunter Fan died. It was professionally installed, and worked great. Until it just wouldn't turn on any more. To get my warranty replacement, I'll need to have it uninstalled then reinstalled. It was supposed to be ""Hunter quality"", that's why I chose Hunter. It was quiet before, but now it's just silent. It works about as well as the generic junk fan I replaced. Very, very disappointed in Hunter lack of quality."
5,a must read,this is an outstanding book. it great to read about the bear caste and what they arew able to do.i was hooked from the first page and was unable to put it done. i can not wait for the next book.
2,Better than #3,"If you like endless prose explaining what type of ammunition troops are using and how they are moving around then you'll love this book. For the most part, this book is just a journal of a battle. I found myself wanting it to end...it just went on and on.My other gripe is a total lack of tension. Something always happens to save the day that is improbable. Reapers are so scary to the characters but they get trashed in every fight.The first novel was awesome! The second was ok, the third was a waste, and this one is just on cruise control.I'm done with this series for a while, it has just become too boring."
5,An Awsome Read Aloud!,"This sensitive, whimsical tale of coping with ones uniqueness is one of my favorite stories for my kindergarten students. The language is rich and descriptive. The illustrations are vivid and immaginative. My students laugh at the funny parts and they understand the heart of the story-regardless of ones differences, be they bespectacled or of uncommon name, each person is valuable just by being him or herself. ""Way to go!"" Ms. Day and Mr. Morris! Michael Stanley, Kindergarten Teacher, City Heights, San Diego"
4,True R&B,Ann Nesby has her own style and one can hear the influence of Ms Aretha Franklin in her voice as well. Great CD that makes you get into what music is suppose to be.
