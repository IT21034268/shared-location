5,Animals in Translation,This book gave me a new perspective on the world. I thoroughly enjoyed every chapter and look forward to learning more on the subjects discussed in the book
4,Fantastic and Frustrating!,"Why Academia? Why do you persist in these old ways of thinking? Wake up and learn about quantum mechanics!A dog always goes to the door to wait for his owner 10-15 minutes before the owner arrives, even if the arrival time is random. The author wants us to believe that this is just the dog's extraordinary hearing?!?A crow distinguishes between the times a homeowner goes inside with the intent to get his gun vs. the times when he leaves with no such intent-flying away only when the man is about to shoot him. And we are to believe that the crow is visually processing subtle differences in the man's behavior?These guys (and girls) are starting to sound like the new flat-earth society.It's an interesting book nonetheless."
5,I wish I'd known this stuff a long time ago,"I am not autistic, so I can't say Temple Grandin's observations on being autistic are 100% accurate, but I love my dog. If you love your dog, and you want to learn about current research and how it applies to your dog and the relationship between humans and animals, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK.It took me over a month to read this book because it was so full of ""Oh, wow, I didn't know that"" moments to read it fast. I am sorry to be returning my copy to the library. I will likely buy it here on Amazon before the end of the year.Great OUTLINE in the back of the book. And the Bibliography is huge: Temple frequently references her sources and I really appreciate the footnotes.The book is not perfect and could have used a little more editing, but overall, it was EXCELLENT."
5,Animals in Translation,An excellent book by an excellent author. Detailed descriptions to give the reader a better understanding of the world of animal behavior. Written so a lay person can understand. Thoroughly enjoyable. Temple Grandin a gift :)
1,just...poor,"I wanted to like this book. I was awed by some of the reviews, fascinated by the notion put forth by many reviewers (as well as TG herself) that she has some special connection and understanding of animals. No. Frankly, I don't believe she does.I have read many books by people who work with animals (Jean Donaldson, Suzanne Clothier for starters) that share a wealth of information and understanding.Honestly, I was more than disappointed in this book. I could not find an insight that was new, and there were some statements that I found simply bizarre.Moreover, there is a basic disconnect here in the idea that a person with a supposedly fine-tuned connection to animals could spend a career developing better ways to slaughter them. I was willing to suspend any judgement on that while reading the book, but I return to that question again."
4,Thought provoking,"In Animals in Translation, Temple Grandin describes how her autism helps her discover how animals perceive the world. She compares an autistic person's perceptions with animals' perceptions, and contrasts them with how non-autistic people think. She also gives her own ideas about how domesticated animals can be treated/trained in order to provide them with the best environment possible. Overall, a very interesting book...It changed my perception of how autistic people and animals think."
1,Misleading Photo!!,I purchased this rain gauge based upon the photo as I was looking for a rain gauge that had measurements in both inches and mm as shown in the photo --what I received has inch measurements on both sides and not what is show in the picture. I hate it when the photo is misleading and frankly I think its intentional a lot of the time.
3,so-so condensed version of the concert,"this cd is an obvious condensed version, good input ftom Alan Jackson & Jimmy Buffet, other than that, not overly impressive"
1,Ridiculous shipping and handling,Make sure you are ok with the shipping rate! Turned out to be $13.95 for this item.
5,So far so good,"I only had occassion to use it twice, and it seems to work just fine. I heard aftermarket batteries sometimes only go a couple of times, hopefully this one will go better than that.Works good in my HV20"
1,Metal Particles In Ice Cream,"I purchased this unit in 6/05 to replace an older model. The hand crank did not fit the bucket, and I had to make adjustments. Then the loose gear mechanism made the top of the ice cream can stick, allowing a lot of metal particles to get on the ice cream. I've written to Rival, who now makes and sells White Mountain twice, with no response. If you could buy an older model, you will be well served. This one is a clearly an inferior product where the manufacturer is now trying to sell it based off of an old brand name."
4,White Mountain Ice Cream Maker,"I love making products with this hand crank machine - I make my company work for their dessert while they have appies, then put the product in the freezer for later - everyone loves it.The only drawback is that some of the metal comes off into the ice cream from the lid and the stem of the dasher - the whole reason why I purchased a new one is to get away from that and I see that it still occurs. I don't like eating metal with my ice cream."
4,not 5 stars but worth having,"Some really great songs - but the first two or three are not as impressive as some of the later ones. And the Love & Dancing album - okay - nice addition, but not great.One of the best albums of it's genre, maybe. But not 5 star to me."
4,Human League - Dar,"I had this on vinyl and was recording a digital copy to my computer. I liked this album and since the price was right, I went ahead and purchased the CD. I saw them in concert in Reyjavik, Icleand in the early '80s, this brings back memories."
1,Not good over the long run,"The performance was just OK in my car. I used it primarily in my workshop, and it worked well. My problem is it lasted just over a year - then went dead. I think most electronics products should last at least a few years. I'll try another brand next."
3,"Good, But Not Very Robust Design","I like the unit but had to replace it in less than 1 year. We would transfer this unit between 3 cars. The constant plugging and unplugging of the unit to move between cars caused wear on the wires, internal and external plugs affecting their ability to hold a connection. This resulted in an intermittent electrical problem that caused the signal to cut in and out. It finally got so bad we had to replace unit. As noted in other reviews, you tend to have a tangle of wires in your car with this unit.Functionally, I liked this unit. The wireless radio connection feature worked well, thirty memories for our variety of tastes, nice selection of menu styles and easy to operate. The stock market feature is great. You can program in stocks and follow the current prices as they march across the screen. Unit is great if it will not be moved often."
2,reality tv makes my life complete,"Having not been a fan of reality since before the tv genre, I must say my eyes have really been opened to how wonderfull life really is via pinoy big brother."
2,Kannada dvd,The DVD doesn't play for long. at first we thought it was my computer but we play it on my husband brand new laptop and it freezes up after your playing it for sometime.
4,Great Bag,Yes it's not the lightest bag but hey you are hauling around multiple pieces of very expensive camera bodies and lenses so what's a pound or two. Quality is good. Zippers are a little stiff but again they are water resistant type zippers with a seal.
3,"Solid, that's it.","I'm happy with this but I think I like my thinktank a lot more. I'm more of a neat guy and the thinktank roller offers that neatness I like. The Tenba roller is a little bunched together but again its smaller and more compact than the thinktank. The wheels and roller arm are a little cheap but again I'm reviewing this based on the fact that I love my ThinkTank and I've been using that for 2 years. I do like the ruggedness this bag offers. I just love bags but this isn't my favorite, still a solid buy."
1,Very disappointed,"I thought this was beautiful so I ordered it. I didn't read the specifications, so when it arrived I said, ""That's IT?!"" It was too small!! It was a better size for earrings. The picture is very misleading. Too bad it's so small it's beautiful but I'm returning it because it will look ridiculous. Someone will have to be in your face to get a good look at it!"
1,Dull and unoriginal,I thought this was really very average. A few elements from Strange Days mixed with Michael Marshall Smith's Spares. Nothing original here. Not even well witten.
2,A disappointing loudness,"I very much wanted to like this book, but found it a disappointment. The central character is as cliche as they come - mysterious military/assassin past, tougher than everyone else, etc. The central mystery was intriguing, but the book was all action, all the time, with little character development. It was like reading a book ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS, ALL THE TIME. The main guy goes from battle to battle, each one trying to be more outrageous than the next. Beheading! Rape! Set on Fire! Vivisection! etc. Finishing it was a struggle."
3,okay,"I think the true sign of the quality of this book is that 2 months after reading it, i couldn't remember the title, much less the plot. That being said, it was an okay book. The setting was interesting but not that much different from a million other cyberpunk worlds. The characterization was okay but none of the characters were truly memorable. The tech had one or two novel ideas but nothing mind-blowing. And the mystery at the center of the plot ultimately turned out to be kind of sordid. Yes, the writing was solid, but ultimately you want more out of good sci-fi, no? I'll keep on searching for the next breakout sci-fi author."
1,"Stilted, trite.","Reminds me of the kind of stuff I saw in my junior college creative writing workshops. Really. Sorry to be rough on the guy and God bless him for putting it out there, but I was so bothered by the stilted writing that I had to put it down. Completely unsubtle, boring use of the language. Like a white boy playing the blues: the guy has a couple chops but lacks soul. Who cares?Read William Gibson again (or for the first time GO NOW!) for chrissakes. How many pages did I get through? About 20 I guess, maybe a couple more. Admittedly, it's not completely fair of me to review a book I hardly started, but I'm suggesting that you not make the same mistake I did and spend money on this. Further, I'd rather re-read Neuromancer a thousand times than take another crack at this brick so this is what you get."
3,"Right story, wrong genre","As a pulp thriller, the story is tight and well paced, and it hits all of the points that a reader would expect from a pulp thriller.As cyberpunk sci-fi, it's hopelessly cheesy and poorly thought out. It became clear after the first several chapters that the author is not well versed in his chosen genre or in the underlying technology, fictional or otherwise. Some tech described in the story is advanced beyond recognition, while some seems unnecessarily stunted and mundane, and the cultural context doesn't fit any of it.Unfortunately, the plot of the thriller depends heavily on the described technology, so the story never comes together like it should. The characters' choices and motivations simply don't make sense after a while, given the social and technological options that *should* be available to them.The book is good enough for me to finish it, but not good enough for me to pick up the next."
2,Ok but Philip Dick he isn't,Slow. Ponderous pacing. One dimensional characters. And one intriguing idea (resleeving). Too bad most of the atmosphere is a redo from PD (as are some of the character ideas). Easily twice as long as needed to play out the plot. I was disappointed in the whole mesh-mash given the level of adoration this book garners. I hope the forthcoming movie does more with the book that the author did.BTW - I got about 300 pages through and couldn't finish it. Real glad I got it from the library!
2,Couldn't care less,"This book was loaned to me as the best sci fi book this person ever read so my expectations were very high. I will return this book without finishing it. Honestly I couldn't care less about what happens in this book. None of the characters is remotely likeable or interesting. The main character is a cold killer. His employer is a guy who has lived so long he has turned terminally boring. His wife is the token ""hottie"" added in the mix as excuse for the usual run of the mill sex scenes. Add the usual mix of bad guys and you see how I didn't care if any of them lived or died. Then the plot: solve a homicide which isn't really a homicide because people can just hop from one body to the next, so the victim is actually alive and well. Mix in some cheap violence and sex and out comes this book."
5,Good mix of mystery and cyberpunk,"I'm not a hardcore fan of cyberpunk. In fact, I probably don't like most. But this book was a successful blend of cyberpunk and a good old fashioned hardboiled detective story, with a little bit of love and sex thrown in for good measure."
2,What a disappointment,"This might be good for someone who has never worked out but I was very disappointed with it. Used it once and it will go to the garage now. This certainly isn't good enough to tone, let alone give you abs of steel. What a joke!"
1,Absolutely horrible,"Bought it yesterday, it is going back tomorrow. Absolutely poor design and construction. That bar sticks right in the middle of your back; you cannot get it tight enough so that it doesn't slant down when you sit on it (and I'm 145lbs); the seat itself is about the size of a dinner plate and the seat is covered with nearly zero padding; need I say more??? I can't even say this is good for a short sitting, let alone a half day hunt. Go back to the drawing board!"
1,"Content fine, but...",Up to page 29 is one type of paper; from page 30 on is printed on completely different paper. Was there any quality control at all?
2,Too many supplement ads,"This magazine is chock full of supplement advertisements. Advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying, but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous. These ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine... It seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness, to the level of competition. A recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women. Some of the women had body fat below 10% - I'm trying to get mine below 30%. It's just a different fitness/weightloss league completely.I like magazines like Fitness and Shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice. I can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese. I can't drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch, eat 10 servings of protein a day, and pop potentially dangerous pills. I am very disappointed with this magazine..."
4,Professionals and Competitors,"I love this magazine mainly because I am a figure and fitness competitor. It has great tips. If you are not competitor and just love to workout, this magazine is for you, too! You will get motivated by every article and meal plans! I do not recommend magazine for individuals who are just looking to get toned and not to cut body fat to supreme low levels. Oxygen can at times overly advertise the supplements. I used to get Shape mag but I did not like the models in that mag. They looked way too small to be advertising fitness. I highly recommend this mag for those individuals are INTERSTED IN COMPETITIONS!"
4,good read for a dedicated fitness enthusiast,"It is geared towards women bodybuilders & fitness models. Because of that there are LOTS (TOO MANY) supplement ads. I enjoy the workouts that can be done at home & it is a no nonsense approach. I feel Tosca Reno (healthy eating) should remain in her column. There are times she is all through the magazine & I wish to hear from different people. May be overkill if you are not into the 6pack, shapely biceps, etc. A little on the pricey side."
2,not the right fit,"I returned this product because it did not stick to the car window. I am not sure if it was a problem with the suction cups. although I doubt this, because I bought two of them, and neither worked. I tried moistening the cups and cleaning them, but no results. Possibly the shape of my windows, the curve of the glass, is not in the realm of your average window for which the shade was manufactued. Toyota Echo Who knows."
1,Doesn't block out the sun AT ALL,"I had a plain gray Brica car shade for my baby, and although it did a fine job of blocking out the sun, it looked pretty dull. So I ordered this. I took it down after one car ride. The sun was hitting my baby full on in the face. This did absolutely NOTHING to block the sun. Don't waste your money. Even though it's cute, it doesn't do what it's supposed to."
5,You have to read this book!,"I am the wife of a Vietnam Vet. I have read hundreds of books about War written by the men and women who were there. Though all of their stories are deserving of great respect some stand out like the North Star on a black night. ""Guns Up"" by Johnnie M. Clark is one of these outstanding books. This book takes you to war in Vietnam and it doesn't let you come back the same person. Read it."
5,Fantastic read - the best Vietnam account I have read.,I read this book at the suggestion of a friend (Sgt. Watson from the book). It was one of the quickest page-turners I have ever read. The reader is quickly made to realize the challenges of war as well as the personal sacrifices made by our soldiers. Anyone who is a soldier or knows one will appreciate this honest and well written account of this group of Marines' tour of duty.
1,white mt freezer,Made in China.Defective motor - worked for less than 60 min.Electric code violation - bare wires visible
1,Disappointed,"I studied long and hard before buying a White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer. I had a hard time justifying the price. I finally decided that it would surely be the last one I ever purchased, so I made the plunge. The second time I used it, the motor made an awful sound, like the bearings must be completely gone. I called them and they promptly sent me a new one. The third time I used it the pressure latch on the bucket came off in my hand. My daughter purchased one not too long before I did and when she used hers for the third time, the motor made the same loud noise. Unfortunately when she called them hers was more than 1 yr old and they would not warranty it. They wanted $90.00 to replace the motor! She opted to go back to the $20 models, after all you can go through 7 of those before you have spent the same amount of money to buy 1 White Mountain."
4,Great Ice Cream - Easy to Clean,We bought the Rival F69204-X-4 Qt ice cream maker in preparation for our annual summer family gathering. None of us had much experience but were able to make great ice cream. The only problem was getting the electric motor securely attached to the wooden bucket using the bracket. It seems like there should be a simpler method needing less muscle. Other than that it works great and is easy to clean.
1,overpriced junk,These are terrible. Parts are no longer available. they used to sell a $7 gear that always strips in the motor housing. now they will only sell you a new motor. Save your money.
2,Motor Problem,"Not sure the first review went through so am sending a second one. After many years, my wife and I purchased this White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer. We were very pleased with the first effort to make ice cream. However, the second time we made ice cream we were not able to finish because the motor started making an extremely loud noise. We returned this freezer and requested a replacement and were pleased when we were sent another freezer. However, when we tried to make ice cream , we found we could not secure the motor because the left ""ear"" did not extend far enough for the latch to make contact with the ""ear"". We had to stand by the freezer while it was working to make sure the motor stayed secure. We are returning this one as well and requesting a replacement.Thanks."
5,I am an old hippie,"I have the vinyl.....wanted the CD. Doesn,t sound exactly the same on CD, but they never do. It is more portable"
3,Music is great but can not tranfer music to mp3,"You can rip this cd to your computer, but it will not let let you put it on your MP3 player which is a rip off. Music companies are going to lose my business if they keep this up. I would not recommend this cd.If i had know this i would not have purchased it."
1,Skip it,"Nothing here you couldn't get from your friends or parents. Basically a feel good speech encouraging you to follow values centered work over the naked pursuit of money. Skip this one. I'm glad I bought it used. I don't know how the other reviewer could give this one 5 starts since there was nothing deep or new here. Good intentions and that's about it. I have often wondered about some of the reviews on Amazon, especially for reviewers that have only ever left one 5 star review or with all their reviews rating things 5 stars. Can I live in their perfect universe?"
1,Hellgate: London,"I enjoyed playing this game in single player mode right up until the final battle. At that point the game developed a glitch and I can't find tech support help to resolve it. I checked it'd forums and see a number of people have a similar problem. I'm sorry, but for $50, I expect to be able have a good killfest right up to the end."
2,Diablo in Purgatory,"In a word; BORING. Too much effort spent on lighting effects such as weapon flash or demon attacks and too little time on the environment. The levels are so similar that they quickly become tedious, so much grey, grey, grey everywhere. The way the NPCs jump and jerk around (bugs in their pants?) when you're interacting with them is irritating. Also because of a game flaw they can be in two places at the same time and remain after their dead with one NPC superimposed on another. All this time spent to develope the game with so little to show for it. Certainly not the worst game ever but don't pay more than $15. The story line? Hmm, not sure of what to say there, confusing? All the weak parts of Diablo with little of the good.Diablo 2"
3,Still in beta,"I feel ripped off with this game. It is unfinished and still a beta product. I have been waiting for this game ever since it was announced and want my money back.So many bugs exist in this game but they must have rushed the release, because bugs from the beta are still unsolved 2 weeks after launch. Some say 'wait til the December patch' - I call BS. These things should have been fixed before release and software companies need to stop selling us broken software with a 'we'll fix it later' attitude.Some find this game fun as it is and defend it mirthlessly, but then again, some enjoy self-mutiliation and dressing up in furry suits.The sketchy pricing scheme is weird too. Not well thought out and rushed is all I can say.NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,dident even get to play when installed,The thing is I tried to play this game but it would not let me when I installed. I followed all the instructions went to the site to but still did not find out why it did not work but with all I heat its a fun game.
1,The price is under five bucks!!,"...However, seeing that the company's death had a LOT to do with the price-drop (Currently @ $3.88) I'll still hold off until this baby's @ least $2.50-3.00 before a purchase..And I have prime membership to boot!"
2,Was great once upon a time,"This game had a shaky start but was one of the most fun games I've ever played on-line. The single player game however left much to be desired and was barely worked on. This presents a large problem to the current game considering all American and European servers are now off-line leaving you with just about nothing to play. Only buy this game if you wish to play a shaky single player game with absolutely no support at all due to Flagship Studios mishandling their company budget and going bankrupt. That had nothing at all to do with the player base, the game was very popular quite often having around 50,000 people on-line at a time but evidently they pocketed the money and did nothing else with it and pulled the plug on the game way before they ever added much content to the game. I'd still play the game today if they had not have simply pulled the plug on the game killing all their subscribers off in one blow."
3,"Daddy, how many Oscars did you say?","OK, this is a fine film and by 1953 standards probably deserving of all the honors. But unfortunately this Peyton Place version of Pearl Harbor doesn't quite make it these days.Montgomery Clift is severely miscast as Prewitt-way too much introspection in my opinion. The producer's original choice was Aldo Ray, who would have been phenomenal in this role and I suspect his career would have been well established as a result. Oh well. And Burt Lancaster's performance was standout, thus renewing my respect for his work. But I suppose I'll never forgive Hollywood for casting the saintly Deborah Kerr in the role of the ..... loose moraled wife of the Company Commander. Talk about casting against type!The DVD has a few extras that fans will enjoy and the 2 channel Dolby is more than adequate. If you're working your way through the list of Best Pictures then you dont want to miss this one, especially if you're a fan of daytime soap operas."
5,Great shape,Received quickly and in great shape really enjoyed it. Thanks againif we take the time to review then you shouldent tell us how many words to use!
3,ONE OF MANY HERBS TRIED,AS FAR AS I KNOW IT WORKS. I HAVE BEEN TAKING IT FOR ABOUT 5 MONTHS WITH OTHER HERBS AND I HAVE NOT BEEN SICK AND I HAVE HAD MORE ENERGY AND FELT BETTER.
1,To the armchair relativists of reality,"It's hilarious that skeptics write books -- and REVIEW books. What, did you guys suddenly sprout absolute standards of evaluating things in reality absolutely? I certainly hope the author has continued this new rational craze by including in his book ""Why People Believe Weird Things"" at least a chapter or two on that funky little thing called skepticism. What's next? Will you guys start believing in cause and effect? Tell me it's so! I suggest a Pepto Bismol, two aspirin, a sturdy night's sleep and a good dose of Ayn Rand the following morning. That'll cure what ails the skeptical couch potato -- if he's got a modicum of remaining honesty. Happy trails!"
4,hmmm.,"Shermer's book is very interesting, and well worth reading. If it does nothing else it makes you think -Do you agree with Mr. Shermer or not? He explains the mind of the skeptic very well (or at least what a skeptic should be ideally), but occasionally fails to live up to his own standards of scientific impartiality. He's very quick to dismiss other peoples beliefs as untrue. However, you can learn a lot from what Mr. Shermer aspires to be: a scientific thinker. his section on the on the fallacies of logic is an excellent thing to keep in mind when reading any work (including Mr. Shermer's). enjoy"
2,Skeptical os skepticism,Why People Believe weird Things--Michael ShermerStrong bias is provided in the book which itself has much pseudoscience in the guise of science
1,Disappointing,The title of the book seemed promising. But the book its self was very disappointing. It is not well organized and the scope of the book and the material presented seem far from each other. What I did not understand was if this was a book which through scientific reasoning showed that people believe in illogical things why include 2-3 chapters about Holocaust??? What's that have to do with it? Is this like a jewish propaganda or something ???
5,Why do sceptics get such a bad rap,"Through out the ages man has used the human eye to explain things around him, more often incorrectly. Most of this misinformation has been spread through religious doctrine instead of scientific observation. We often see people turn to the absurd and often silly avenues of psychics, fortunetellers and other spooks to find out the answers to the most basic questions. Yet what makes these people turn to the silly and often absurd when it more often base don pure chance. Why People Believe Weird Things by Michael Shermer presents a number of topics that are very much the subject of intense debate including Creationism, Holocaust Denial, Cults, UFO Belief and many other hot topics. The book presents the arguments and Shermer produces the facts to help explain the reason why many fall for the traps of such silly and often destructive beliefs. Yet one must be careful as this book will offend many and make you the party pooper!"
3,Why peaple believe weird things,"Shermer makes more sense than anyone else I have ever read. He challenges the reader with his intellect. I find it slow reading because I keep going back over paragraphs to make sure I've ""got it"". Its well worth the effort."
5,Great Fun!!,"Yeah, disco is cheesey, but who cares?This DVD is non-stop fun. Just watching the middle aged audience bump and grind to these clasic disco hits is a riot!!The performers are all rock solid. The DVD quality is fantastic. Buy this DVD for your next party. It will bring a smile to everyone who once wore leisure suits, platform shoes, and a shag haircut."
5,Pink Tea is a great song,"This single contains Pink Tea, one of Ant Farm's most popular songs before they were signed to DreamWorks. Pink Tea appears on their first CD, ""Greatest Hits,"" which has been selling for as much as [price]. It is a great song but Denigrate which is on the other single is one of their best songs ever."
3,"Good Game, but buy the newer version","This is an excellent roleplaying game, and I learned the game out of this manual. if you have to choose, though, the Revised and Expanded version is much better, albeit expensive. I think it's worth it though. Easily the best RPG ever- appeals to gamers and ""non-nerds"" alike. More questions before you buy? E-mail me!"
1,Crap,"When we received it the speaker was broken, physically the magnet had fallen off. After that was fixed, the transmitter only worked from about 6"" from the receiver! For the price it's not worth sending back so were going to Home Depot where it can easily be returned."
2,This is a poor product,"It's quite annoying that the bell automatically rings without anyone pushes the button. However, when you really push the button, it is about 90% works. And the battery inside the pushbutton is loose so I believe that is the reason. Waist money."
3,Not My Favorite,"This is a very old book. While I was reading it the binding failed and the book fell apart. I have enjoyed reading other Abby books, but this one was not worth the price."
4,Mixed Feelings,"What it lacks in content it makes up in sound quality. I'll talk about the sound quality first. I can not believe how this sounds. How they managed to get this quality I'll never know. So rich and full sounding you won't believe your ears. Clear as a bell no tape hiss you really need to listen to this. It is just fantastic. Now the content, The little yellow sticker states All of Roys biggest hits, Thats would not be my opinion. All the Monument is on the first CD and there is alot missing. Not quite all of his biggest hits, Not Close, Running Scared a #1 hit is not here, In Dreams a #2 hit not here, Mean Woman Blues a # 5 hit not here.. All his newer stuff is on the second disc. There is realy only a couple of hits, 2 top 40 thats it. Lots of fillers. But to be fair That sound quality is great. It's worth the price for the songs that are on here they, Sony has really raised the bar. Hopefully someone will fill in the missing songs with as good a sound quality in the future."
1,Not Van's Fault,"Sony issued this one. The only reason to get this CD is because of ""Brown Eyed Girl"", but at least it has an unedited version on it, unlike the Greatest Hits album. I bought the Greatest Hits album for everything else and this recording to obtain a decent copy of ""Brown Eyed Girl""."
5,This is NOT a childrens's book!,"This book chronicles the problems faced by the single mother of a transsexual male child. The anguish, the heartache and the unnecessary turmoil, through which mother and child are forced to endure, caused by society at large and the professional medical establishment, makes compelling reading. Just because this outstanding work is written in language easily understandable by any high school level teenager, don't make the mistake that it is a child's book.Highly recommended for all who are facing the same life story, as well as for those who counsel and provide professional 'advice' to those having to deal with a transssexual life. Every public library should have a copy as should every professional dealing with the phenomenon of transsexuality."
4,Beautiful views with lots of arguing!,I have to admit. I enjoyed the series when it was on the history channel and jumped on it when i saw it for $4.00 on Amazon. It is what it is. Nice scenes will lots of arguing. Like one of the reviewers said. I was half expecting a lion to jump out and eat Pasqually when he was trying to go through the brush and seemed clueless where they were. Would I spend $20 for it? No! $4.00 yes. I enjoyed it!
2,Clinique Chemistry By Clinique For Men. Cologne Spray 3.4 OZ,"Not very good at all. Very bland and plain, I do not have the language skills to break it down into scientific term on why this cologne does not work for me. I am not picky or have high standards but this was a huge dispointment. Gave it too my friend and he does not like it either. His words were as mine.. does nothing for me."
2,A Story of a young Arab/American girl moving to a strange ne,"The book Habibi by Naomi Shahab Nye is about an Arab/American girl who moves from St. Louis to Israel. Her Father makes her move because it's his home country and he wants her, Rafik, and her brother to know about it. Also, I think that he missed his home and finally had enough courage to move back. This book had a great way of displaying things, but I find they should show more of both sides than leaning all the way to the Arab side. It would make it less boring if it compared the Jews and Arabs thoughts much more then it does now. This book was still Ok, but I myself wouldn't suggest it to people if they want the exact story line. Personally, I like reading fantasy adventure books so I look at it from a different perspective."
2,The Abboud&#65533;s Second Life,"Liyana is a 13 year old girl that live in St. Louis, but her dad decided to move back to his home Palestine. She is an outsider and tries to fit in at her new school. She meets a boy named Omer. It is hard for them to stay friends because he is Jewish and she is Arab, and in Palestine the Arabs and the Jew's fight all the time. She wants there to be peace between Arab's and Jew's, and wonders if it will ever happen. This was an ok book. It was a great book, but it's not really my type of book. I like myisteries and action books. I think Rafik is the coolest character in the book. He is nice, funny, and dosen't care what people think of him. The writing style was good, and the subject matter was a good subject to talk about. The characters seemed to be real."
3,The Abboud family moves from the us to Palestine,"***Habibi is about a young girl, Liyana and her family. Her father, Poppy is Arabic and her mother is American. She lived in America her whole life, then when she is going into high school her family moves to Palestine where all her fathers relatives live...I thought the book was a good way of showing how things are in the middle east. The book can really make you think about what people go through and how it is so hard for them to get along. It also makes me think about how many people are trying to get peace between all the people there. I thought the book was boring at first but as I read further and further I got really interested in it. It teaches you a lot about how the culture is in Palestine. I really enjoyed reading this book."
2,fun time,BY NAOMI NYE SHIBAH When a fourteen year old Liyana Abbound had her first kiss from her class mate which the kiss was a secret and the kiss grew larger and larger. Now Liyana and her family have to move from St .Louis a place where Liyana and her brother Ralif felt embarrassed in because their father usually returned his dinner for not being hot enough .They must move to a new home between Jerusalem and the Palestinian village where her father was born. In this place they face many changes and must deal with the tensions between the Jews and Palestinians. Liyana met a Jewish boy called Omar who gave her a surprise gift for her birthday and they met one day and he gave her a kiss. But they getting together will be a problem. I think the book is really boring but I will encourage everybody to read.
5,Tiny cans,"These are small 6 oz cans. The product is great, but they should warn you the cans here are tiny, and extremely expensive per ounce. update... I was contacted by the seller and they informed me what I ordered was the fogger, not the ""Area Treatment"". They were very gracious about my error."
3,Not worth the extra money,"Sure, the product worked as good as the stuff you can get at Walmart, but its not worth triple the price"
1,Sewage,"This movie will make you stupid. If you enter the theater stupid, you will be wheelchaired to an assisted living home upon exiting. If you are not stupid upon entering, you will be when you leave. There are no qualities worth mentioning concerning this film, none. A two hour film depicting a river of raw sewage would be more entertaining. Save your money."
3,El Príncipe... muchas veces malinterpretado,"En la obra de Maquiavelo se refleja el pensamiento del Renacimiento en su forma más original, libre y abierto despojado de toda preocupación metafísica, dirigido totalmente a observar la realidad humana y describir científicamente las normas y los fines inmediatos que regulan y orientan su desarrollo. El príncipe debe estar dispuesto a obrar contra la fe, contra la religión, si el fin así lo requiere.La filosofía realista y pesimista de Maquiavelo tiene poco que ver con lo que, con evidente malafe, se llamó más adelante ""maquiavelismo"", deformando su pensamiento, pues cuando el secretario florentino hablaba de política, se refería a los intereses y modos propios de la política y no a la moralidad, y cuando aducía que el fin justifica los medios, quería significar fin y medios políticos, y nunca formular una cínica norma espiritual de vida."
3,it's ok,"its more of stories like on tv, i wanted it to be more of real life actual scenes of an autopsy's being performed cause my 17yr kid wants to be an M.E. So,if this is what you too are thinking it is.? ( Isn't.) and its more 70's tv too"
4,Util,"Para quienes siendo forenses requerimos de material para la actividad docente. No doy la quinta estrella porque no se profundiza en el procedimiento mismo de la autopsia forense. HBO debería publicar una serie completa sobre estos temas tan apasionantes. La vida misma, la muerte misma."
2,Another step downhill,"His last release was still decent but a bit overly limited to midi and drum machine instrumentation. This CD gets away from that only slightly by the addition of more ethnic instruments and WAY too much vocals. The drum machine is obviously still present. The first 4 cuts are just plain gastric. The vocalist has a good/not great voice. With this much emphasis on vocals he should have worked harder to get a better singer. Just not very pleasing, and kind of irritating. There are a few good songs on the disk, but sadly not enough to justify the purchase. Here is my recomendation. He is just starting his world tour. The songs that are worthwhile will get ironed out and humanized on his followup Live CD after the tour. That one will be much more worth listening to. Charlie, Ric, and all the other greats will really flesh the good songs out. Just don't waste your money on this disk."
4,Vocals are not as bad as the reviews say.,"Just give it a shot. This is a nice album with 4 or 5 good tracks to its credit. My favorites are Rainmaker,For all seasons and Playing by heart. Yanni should stick with instrumental music. My guess is that instead of taking it seriously Yanni just experimented with a different style other than his own unique style. Come on Nightbird!!! you can do much much better than this."
4,New Age Musician.,"I really enjoyed this cd. Yanni has kept to a similar grasp on composing, but with a different sound. Yanni, is a blessed musician in the fact that he has been very successful at keeping to his extremely vast span of creativity.If you enjoy this kind of music, you should check out Troy Reed..."
2,Yawn. Another Yanni Album.,"Well, I was looking forward to this as I always look forward to new Yanni albums. But more and more, I am disappointed. Go back about four albums and play them all together and they sound the same. There is absolutely nothing new here. There is absolutely nothing exciting here. Yanni used to be new and exciting and his music was exhilarating. No more. Two stars instead of one is because Yanni is Yanni and you know what you're getting now when you buy a Yanni album. Sweet background music. Too bad."
3,Yanni has turned to being a Yawning....sorry,"Don't get me wrong, I have been a fan of Yanni for quite a while, but, this CD...well, the whole album (CD) seems like one long musicial piece. I play music myself and love new age as well as many other styles of music. His earlier works were more fulfilling to me. It seems he made this CD only because of his name not his talent, which I know he has. The singing is a bit much, the woman sounds the same thru every song. Sure, it is upbeat, but, it is not as creative as his past ventures. ..."
1,this is the only yanni album that blows,this album sucks cuz it has too many words in it and it doesn't sound like real new age music. I suggest that people out there who read this that likes no words music then this album isn't for you.
2,Leaves Me Questioning,"Yawni (as I like to call him) was a pretty cool fella when he was dating Linda Evans and her shoulder pads but since the break-up he has gone straight down hill. As a belly dancer who once lived in Borneo, I truly love ethnic music but Mr. Yawni has taken out the city and left us with ethni which makes no sense to me.I like the African influences and the ethereal female vocals but other than that I can find no use for this album. I can't even sleep to it because it keeps me awake wondering ""why, Yawni, why?"".I prefer Niki Nana because it reminds me of my sweet ole granny with her support hose falling down around her ankles as she taught me belly dancing to the raging rhythms of ""Never Dance with a Stranger"" (something granny taught me never to do because men, she'd say, are like whiskey and cigarettes - bad habits hard to break). Therefore, I belly dance."
1,a shocking album for yanni fans,"I wonder how could a great musician like yanni allowed this album to appear.Although i am a super yanni fan, I couldn't find any lovely music in this album.In fact I found ugli music & I started to wonder if this is the same yanni who produced Acropolis,tribute or if I could tell you!The instruments are very poor,the crying (vocals ) is excessive & boring + the themes are not good, in fact they are poor.I advise all yanni fans to buy this album, listen to it 4 to 5 times & then send their openion to yanni.Finally I hope that yanni put his fans'openion in his mind & think over with himself ( AM I ADVANCING OR GOING BACK ? )"
2,Lo mismo de siempre...,"Para quienes oyen por primera vez a Yanni les fascinará (o extrañará) oir muchos coros y vocalizaciones en este ultimo CD, pero para quienes estamos acostumbrados a su musica instrumental, a la meditacion dentro de sus ritmos electronicos suaves, es un CD que no trae muchas cosas nuevas. Esperé oir algo como la continuacion de ""If I could tell you"" que me parecio un CD mucho mejor que este, o incluso sus CDs anteriores, en los que no se cansa de repetir y repetir canciones, que aun así, siguen siendo clásicos del New Age.Yanni tambien, pone ritmos mas diversos en este CD, junto a las vocalizaciones, incorpora algunos fondos con acento irlandes o de esas regiones (intuyo) pero esto le hace dar más un aire de superficialidad que de originalidad, y no por la incorporacion misma de esos elementos, mas bien porque no queda con su estilo. Me quedo con los CDS anteriores"
1,My god! What a disgrace!,"I bought this album because, even though I'm more a metal fan I do like music that will relax me. I've heard some stuff about Yanni (mostly from old ladies and such..) that he is a very talented musician. So I got the album and at night I played it. My god! I couldn't sleep. His vocals are so weird.. I can't tell if it's a a 5th grade girl, or if it's him! Since that album kept me up I took my car and ran it over the following week. The only reason I didn't run it over sooner is because I tried let it sinking in. Didnt work. I advise you not to buy this alubm. It is no where near the relaxing music I was hoping for. Terrible sounding instrumentals and odd annoying vocals make this album ""the SUCKsess"" it is today. Hmmm... Seems like the only point of life is to set yourself as a warning for others..."
3,I'm Disappointed.,"I had been listening to Borknagar's previous masterpiece Empiricism relentlessly before I picked this up, and was really expecting a progression with Epic. Well, first of all the guitar work sounds muffled, and while I can't deny Asgeir Mickelson's drum talents, he does tend to be somewhat repetitive. Vintersorg's clean singing is too high-pitched in some places. It certainly isn't bad per se, but I just expected more from Borknagar. Maybe it'll grow on me..."
3,Eh well- It Ain't Dimmu...,"Here's my bias- I bought this the same day I got Enthrone Darkness Triumphant by Dimmu Borgir. To be honest, not much can compare to that cd. However, I have since given it a fair chance, and remain unconvinced. Don't get me wrong- some of it is great. Songs like Future Reminiscence and The Wonder are awesome. They sound very medieval and Arthurian. But most of it is repetetive and gets boring after just a few listens. And they need to tell their drummer to chill out with the double bass! Future Reminiscence, for example. The synth riff and the vocals are slow and medieval sounding, but the double bass is just pounding away and completely ruins the effect of the rest of the song. Get it for those few good songs, but buy some Dimmu to balance out the bad ones."
4,polar bike mount,The product was affordable. It was shipped right away and it arrived promptly. It works as advertised.
3,It does what it's supposed to but attach method needs improvement,"This product makes it simple to mount my HRM in an easily viewable position on my road bike, but it attaches by zip ties which severely limits the ability to move it to a different position or perhaps to another bike. A clamp-type attachment would probably make this a more expensive product but it would definitely be more functional that way. As it is, it would be impossible to use for spinning classes like it says unless you plan to keep a pack of zip ties and a snip in your gym bag."
2,Dull...Zzzzzzzz....,"I am a fan of Ruth Rendell and Barbara Vine and fortunately have read some of her wonderful novels. If ""The Rottweiler"" had been my first Rendell novel, it probably would have been my last. The book is just plain dull. The plot goes nowhere and plods along at a snail's pace. I wanted to finish the book so I stayed with it, but it took me forever because I kept falling asleep trying to read it. The characters are one dimensional stock caricatures. They are a sad lot with none having any redeeming qualities. I ended up disliking all of them and I wouldn't have cared if the book ended with the killer doing away with every last one of them. One of the problems with the plot is that there are too many subplots going...even the main plot (the murders) is more like a subplot. The many plotlines are never really brought together in a satisfactory way. It just leaves you with the feeling, ""thank goodness that's over."" Yawn..."
3,Average,"If I had read the book before Seven of Nine appeared, I would have liked it more. However, the borg being de-assimilated contradicts everything about Seven of Nine. Besides that, the idea of a species more powerful then the borg (almost a preminiton of species 8472) was interesting"
2,The book disappoints readers who hate the Borg.,"Peter David starts out with a very good and very engaging plot- the origin of the planet killer, the second one, its mission and power, etc. He brings the readers' hopes up, leading them to believe that perhaps, finally, there is a ship out there that can defeat the Borgs' cursed adaptability. But, alas, no, David chooses to burst their bubble. To me, the entire crux of the story was not the spirits of the Planet Killer, but its abilities, and how they might save the Federation. The author of this book is clearly too timid to establish a precedent--that is, the existance of a ship that can defeat the Borg, with impunity, despite their adaptability. For those readers who are more concerned with the so-called ""background"" ( the politics, battles, inventions and etc. of Star Trek), this book is only worthy of burning. Warn friends, please"
4,Cleaning up,I have wood floors in my house and the floormax has saved me lots of down time (on my knees). I would reccomend it to anyone.
2,Pooped out the first use!!!!!,"I absolutely loved this machine after I shampood my carpets with ease, reloaded the tank with ease and changed the scrubber heads with ease, then came the bare floors. For some reason it decided it had had enough of me and refused to start! I tried everything and finally started shaking the thing and it finally came on! This was the first day I had it. Then it started smelling a faint odor of burning machinery, so now I will take it to a hoover repair place. What a hassle! I am not happy!"
4,very good polisher,"I had a shampoo/polisher years ago, The Hoover I purchased is very good but I had to get use to it not having an off/on switch, instead it has a switch that activates the machine when the handle is released. I still think it is a very good polisher and has come in very handy."
4,A thoughtful study of the subject,"This is a great overview book for anyone interested in the topic of cannibalism. While there are a lot of stories that are dealt with in a cursory manner, there is enough analysis to make the book truly worthwhile. The author explores the motivations for breaking of ""the last taboo"" and includes lots of historical examples of each of those motivations. By asking thought provoking questions of the reader, Askenaasy puts you in the place of those who are alleged to have eaten their fellow man. He also asks the reader to question third party ""evidence"" and shows how not all that we read is necessarily true even given reliable sources. The book certainly left me thinking more about the topic than ever before and in news ways."
2,"Too much Ecuador, not enough mystery","Although Wishnia knows a lot about Ecuador (more than anyone needs to know), the elements of mystery fall flat. The tangled, disjointed threads of plots are hard to follow and, generally, not worth a lot of effort. The character of Filomena is tough as a nut, self-centered, militantly left-wing in her thinking. Generally, an unsympathetic bore. It's hard to maintain interest in her."
1,nothing like the original scent,"My Mother wore this scent forever. Mother has been gone for 35 yrs now, and I have searched and searched for the perfume she wore. My delight turned to disappointment , upon receiving the Shocking I ordered.It had the most awlful smell even in the bottle, not just on me."
2,Build quality not so good,"The table sure looks nice, and nothing beats free shipping on this kind of heavy thing. However, the build quality is not so good from the two tables I bought:1. One top surface panel's veneer has some bubbles in it2. One bottom panel was scratched with a big hole (probably during shipping). I end up mix and match to have only one overall good looking table facing outwards3. Many locking screws can't be tightened up enough (the holes are not deep enough)4. The wood is very soft, so be careful with the tools you use"
3,Not a bad puzzle overall,"I received this puzzle as a birthday gift a little while ago and decided to try to put it together with a friend when I had some time over the holidays. We had a bit of fun trying to figure out which movie each of the people were from, and while it took a bit of time to make it, it wasn't any more difficult than your average 1000 piece puzzle. I wish they had a list of the characters in the image on the back or side of the box, but other than that it was fine. Overall a decent gift, just not my favorite image for a puzzle."
4,"Pieces are not all ""interlocking"", making it not stable or solid","The concept of this puzzle is entertaining, utilizing some of Hollywood's most recognizable movie characters for a huge collage.However, there are many pieces that are simply not interlocking, and they just sit next to one another. This makes it challenging, because the pieces tend to slide around when working around them.There are a few pieces are are disproportionally drawn, such as the hands of certain characters.The puzzle is rather simple, however, being that so many pieces are fleshtone, or similar for clothing, makes is difficult.Again, all the pieces are not interlocking, making it more of a challenge to work on.....Rizzo"
2,piece missing?,"Love these puzzles to work with my grown kids on rainy days when they come to visit, but this one had a piece missing right on the edge so we knew right away cause we always do the edge first. Not happy about that!"
5,"Oh, LORD! I LOVED this Book!","I was in the 8th grade when I found this book in our school library-- I thought I would drive my dad crazy, I never laughed so hard at anything in my life! He kept getting sort of amused/frustrated at me-- I'd be lounging on the couch, reading about Roger's experiences at parachute/jump practice, or special boot camp, or some drunken party, and HOWLING with laughter to the point that my dad would look at me like I was crazy! Then I'd read what was making me laugh (and a lot of times, I was laughing so hard I wasn't quite clear)-- I think he finally read the book himself!And tonight, on a whim, I typed the title into Google and found that I can still get it here! Though the price is a bit much, but dang it, I'm going to try for one of the used copies next payday!Brilliant book, simply brilliant!"
3,Efficiently written with little discernible motivation,"I first encountered this book as a first-year graduate student in 1981. The material is presented in well-organized, logical, and efficient manner--somewhat too efficient for a student who is interested in more than merely encountering a collection of theorems. There is little motivation for the results presented. One suspects from the absolutely minimal length of each proof that the author is an environmentalist afraid to cut down trees. Nonetheless, my experience with the book did ultimately provide an adequate background for my further studies in mathematical analysis."
5,a flight to the fininsh,"adventures in odyssey are really good and uplifting and will keep your children interested . my son is 3yr and he loves flight to the finish, baby daze and once upon a avanlanche and we are going to more and yes my husband and i even enjoyd watching them as well and my 5yr ol neephew and 10yr old niece loved them as well."
1,No solder lugs,"I'm no expert, but the internal pins do not look like any solder lugs I've seen. No ""cup"" to hold the wire. The female partner to this connector has solder lugs, don't know why the male connector doesn't."
2,TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT,"THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BOOK IS THAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF TIMES SQUARE BUT IT BECAME TOO MUCH A BOOK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF BROADWAY, THE SHOWS AND THE ACTORS. MAYBE TO THE WRITER THEY'RE ONE AND THE SAME. ALSO, THE WRITER IS FROM THE NY TIMES AND HE WRITES WITH THAT UPPITY ATTITUDE AND LANGUAGE THAT ONE COMES TO EXPECT FROM THAT NEWSPAPER. IT USUALLY TAKES ME DAYS TO READ A BOOK OF THIS SIZE. THIS BOOK TOOK ME WEEKS BECAUSE IT LOST MY INTEREST. THERE WERE SOME INTERESTING PARTS ABOUT THE BUILDINGS AND THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE COME AND GONE, HOWEVER, I WOULD TRY A DIFFERENT BOOK ABOUT TIMES SQUARE."
1,Details details!,I find it amazing that the product specifications and details include the weight and other irrelevant information but fails to say what size nut drivers these are. I'll take two.
3,Not So Good,"I love the Real World and I always try and buy the books that come out after the show has ended. I was disappointed with this one because it came out in the middle of the series and gave away stuff that happened in the latter part of the series. I know that it's not a movie, where the ending matters, but I was bummed to learn the Keri and Kyle ended up leaving on bad terms. After watching the show it made more sense to me, but while reading the book I learned that they weren't talking and didn't know if they could ever be friends again. I was bummed to get information from the book that I hadn't yet seen on the show. It seems like some of the earlier Real World books tell more secrets and off-camera stuff. Get it from the library!"
4,What every man needs to know.,"I feel this book is very interesting in that it offers insight and direction concerning the thoughts and behavior of men. It offers a God center showing that there is a way to avoid the pitfalls that many of us often blindly fall into. Great reading, insight and challenging."
5,Billionaire Secrets to Success,"This book is absolutely amazing. Bill Bartmann went from welfare to being the 25th wealthiest person in America, which is a great achievement. Imagine having 4000 employees and taking them and their spouses on vacation with you. Bill took his employees to Disney World, on ocean cruises and Las Vegas to name a few. Bill was a giver and now he does it again by giving us 9 steps to help us achieve great success. Get this book for your library and read it over and over again."
5,"Don't set goals! Make a strong promise to yourself! You wll achieve the ""impossible""!","The most important message I've got from thisinspiring book was:Don't set goals! Make a strong promise to yourself.Bill Bartmann shows us that there are no pre-requisitesto be wealth in life. All you need is a larger than life ""will""to fulfill your promise to yourself and to the world.That mindset will help you achieve almost anything in life,including walking after all doctors would tell you would beparaplegic for the rest of your life. Including amassingmillions of dollars, etc...Thanks Bill for taking the time and share your life experienceswith the rest of us in this valuable document. I wish otherbillionaires would do the same. You are very special!"
5,LIFE CHANGING...if you let it.,"Life has a funny way of taking an individual on many journeys. Often times, it can easily derail you from what your original passion and focus was.If you're looking for a quick ""pick me up' only to burn out from the twists and turns of life, then this book may not be for you.Bills book will teach you; and it's contagious.He will show you how to apply fundamental principles to get you where you want to be....AND STAY THERE!Reading Bill's book has not only refueled the fire and passion of dreams and talents that were uniquely mine, but it has taught me to sustain the desire and see it to fruition. I started seeing results, in business and personally, BEFORE I finished his book!!A must read!"
2,"Nice try, but look elsewhere before you settle with this Eurotango","Expect plenty of Latin delights if you listen to this CD, but the production of the CD could have gone better. They watered down the Piazzolla works, and they flooded this tango extravaganza with too much flute solo. Not bad for a Bohemian orchestra attempting Argentine tango, but I prefer ensembles from South America to delight me with that naughty naughty music from Buenos Aires!"
4,delivery,"the ability to order subscriptions economically through Amazon is great, and we are looking forward to reading it regularly, and perhaps seek other subscriptions; BUT WHERE IS IT????????????????????ALEC NELSON"
3,Great Magazine,"This is a wonderful magazine for those who live out west or in the mountains. Good articles and columns on travel, gardening and decorating. Similar to Midwest Living and Southern Living. Makes a good gift for friends and family who live in the west."
3,color or not,i have more of a question on the new release is it in color? if so the is even more damage to a great film.Magnificent Ambersons
1,Terrible,"I do not know why this movie is so highly rated by so many people. It is a boring story, poorly directed, photographed darkly and mostly over-acted. The Wells style, used so effectively in ""Citizen Kane,"" is totally botched here. Wells style of having people talk over and interrupt each other (used for realism) is effective in ""Kane,"" but badly misses here. Even the redemption scene at the end does not get the message across. I usually like the Wells films, but this one is a flop."
4,Good despite the cuts,"The Bottom Line:The Magnificent Ambersons is known more for what it represented in Orson Welles's film career than as a film itself, but if you get a chance you should check out this well-made slice of family drama that admittedly gets murky towards the end (where the studio's fingerprints are all over it) but is a fine companion piece to Citizen Kane even if it's not the complete version.3.5/4"
5,Will They Or Won't They Have The Guts To Release It ?,"As related at the Digital Bits web site, Warner Brothers ""is"" to release this title on January 10th 2012...we shall see & when allowed I will pre-order from Amazon ASAP !!!Have fun and a Happy New Year :)"
5,Best Cookbook I own.,"I taught myself to cook with this cookbook. The fact that it is organized by the seasons, removed the stress of an inexperienced cook looking for something seasonal, like asparagus, at the wrong time of year. The fact that it was in menu format taught me how to put a nice meal together. The recipes use basic ingredients and not prepackaged mixes which helped me understand what tastes go with other taste, and that also keeps the cost down. Simple secrets, like using lime juice to flavor the chicken in fajitas, came to me as I methodically went through cooking nearly every recipe. This cookbook changed the way I keep my pantry stocked and how I feed myself. I had Amazon find me a copy for a friend who is struggling to learn how to cook. It should be reprinted."
2,No translation makes these useless,I was hoping to use these tapes while driving in my car. There is no English Translation with these. This makes these useless to me
3,this game is fun,this game had everything a adventure fun and some of the Simpsons well i watch the show and it is fun but the game is like the same thing u can play as anyone so i give this game 5 stars of fun but it is haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard
3,PS2 Simpsons game,"The game is in good condition, and my kids are enjoying it. It arrived in a very timely fashion."
2,Great Marketing Ploy,"Well the marketing boys are back at it again, if you like the Doors then buy their albums and the odd DVD you will save money for starters, these studio albums plus extra tracks are not the original albums are they,as they have extra tracks, music from this era in my opinion is at its best on the original vinyl, and please dont mention ENHANCED it means nothing to me its about as good as 5:1 surround sound on the DVD in this case.. as stated my opinion is that music from this era is at its best on the original vinyl /... save your money .. music recorded today in digital format and DVDs in 5:1 surround sound are fantastic dont get me wrong but this era as i have said... save your moneyRob Jones"
2,DOORS SHOULD REMAINED LOCKED,"COME ON NOW!!!YOU CELEBRATE THE ""DOORS"" BY PUTTING THIS OUT!!!???AN EXPENSIVE WASTE OF TIME THAT STARTS OFF WITH A POOR BOX PRESENTATION AND THEN GIVES ""THE DOORS"" RELEASES WITH SOME OUTTAKES AND STUDIO FLOOR DROPPINGS...DVD OFFERINGS-NOT BAD...SAVE YOUR MONEY AND INVEST IN THE DOORS BOX SET OF RE-MASTERS.THIS DOORS OFFERING SHOULD HAVE REMAINED CLOSED."
5,I read this book at the right time to make use of the information in it,"I got lucky with this book. It addressed all my immediate needs at the time of purchase. I had already determined that I would work for myself, but there were many first-time issues to handle in short order. By following along with the decision points and advice, I was able to form my entity type and do all the things that followed. The book helped me because I'm part of the target audience, service professionals.The information on paying estimated taxes also turned out to be spot-on. What could have been a worry and anxiety producing matter turned out to be routine the first time I did it. When I already knew what to do but just wanted verification and source support, this book helped and easily justified the purchase."
5,Great resourse guide.,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law who is starting a small business, she liked it very much.I have also gotten some great ideas for myself. I am purchasing a copy for my own usage, I think it has some most valuable information."
5,Great cd!,"I love this c.d.! I have all his c.d.s to date (new one just released this week fyi)and me and my family have never been disappointed. O-Shen is an artist with real talent and with positive messages, amazing! Get this c.d. youl love it."
4,Wheres the rest ?!,"The biggest fault in this albulm is there are only 10 songs ! Even britney has 11 or 12 on hers. I wanted more ! I bought this 3 days ago because I was listening to BBMak a few days before and really liked a few songs from them like Back Here, Miss you more, Out of my heart. I was sad to hear they had broken up, I really did like them. So i saw it n bought it. my first listen i was really dissappointed.. no songs like out of my heart or back here but after my 2nd run i felt better.highlights:1. out of my heart - one of my fav songs of all time .. enough said on that one2. staring into space - wonderful song.. i really like the refrains .. just makes you wanna bounce .. does sound like a throw back to the old 60's musica few other songs stand out .. the latter songs on the alulmb arent really upbeat .. i was in an upbeat mood after listening to the first half .. so in all n all not bad.. just a few more songs, esp some upbeat ones would've been great.. but sad they broke up."
3,Lost In Anonymity,"BBMak's second disc finds the group focusing far less on the melodies that fueled their debut and instead cranking up the guitars for a sound that mixes Revolver-era Beatles, Oasis, U2, and the Smithereens. Unfortunately, the tight harmony work found on their debut is diluted in favor of this ultimately anonymous guitar pop sound. The set's first single,'Out Of My Heart', is a nice start, but then several of the songs that follow threaten to bleed into one another with their soundalike guitar riffs. Alot of people seem to love it, and though it's far from a disaster, I just don't think it sounds nearly as tight and melodic as alot of the stuff that saturated their debut. You be the judge."
2,Interesting but too wide ranging and not detailed enough,"The book claims to be a comprehensive guide to writing test items in several areas. It covers a diverse range of test items, from multiple choice questions to setting and scoring student portfolios. What it says is interesting, but it covers too wide a ground to be able to be comprehensive with its 260 pages in any one area, and ends up being useful as an introduction, but not too useful as a comprehensive resource.For example, it has 22 pages on statistical analysis on item responses, which is enough to whet the appetite, but not enough to answer all or even most of one's questions. I also found the layout and style slightly confusing.It's not a bad book, but it's not really clear what the book's purpose is. It might have been better for it to focus on one area in more depth, or else to market it as an introduction, and at a more reasonable price."
4,lovely performance,"This is a very nice compilation of Vaughan Williams' vocal music, some of which is not easy to find on CD. The performers do an excellent job. Nice voices, and the music is sensitively sung. A really good value."
2,if only.........,"It would help to have samples of the songs,so I could decide on buying it and reviewing it?"
2,A Stone-Cold Rip Off!,"While looking for a movie gift to give to my mother for Christmas I was excited to see this oldie offered in Blu Ray. I even bought her a Blu Ray Player to watch it on.I don't need to tell you how disappointed and angry I was to find out it is only done in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The ad says ""widescreen"" but the black bars placed vertically on each side beg to differ. It is so aggravating after carefully scrutinizing every last detail only to find one huge one omitted.Why include the fancy book, the features disc, and all the vintage hoopla but neglect to provide the biggest asset of quality transfer.....a theater-like widescreen picture!It's sad when my mother says the version she recorded off of the TCM network a few months ago is widescreen, but the $26 movie I purchased with all its trivia and trimmings is ""made for TV""."
4,Classic,Meet Me In St Louis is a must see musical classic. The acting and the songs are unforgettable. Especially Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.
1,another horrible WB bluray transfer,So what is WB's excuse this time. One more horrible transfer of a classic film to bluray. WB should be put out of the bluray business. The grain once again is as big as pea soup. On large screen tv this film is not viewable on bluray. Do not waste your money and buy the DVD.
5,Everything That's Good About MGM Musicals,"I cannot find a fault with this movie. The music is fantastic. Judy Garland is at her peak. Vincente Minnelli balances story and visuals. The sountrack alone is worth the price of admission.The bonus features are excellent as well. A look back at the history of MGM seen through eyes of the period of her greatest hour of need (the early 1970s) and documentary on the making of the film are priceless. The trip through Judy's career via her movie trailers is a trip worth taking. For all that MGM did wrong, including its mistreatment of Judy Garland, they did manage to produce the greatest musicals of all time.If you're not a fan of Judy Garland when the film starts, you'll be more than a fan by the end; you'll be in love with her. Vincente Minnelli had this experience with this movie and so will you."
5,Judy Garland's Best Film Ever!,"I first saw this movie when I was seven years old and it has been one of my all-time favorites ever since. The cinematography is gorgeous. The technicolor brings out the lush set designs and costumes. This is one those movies that you should watch if you're feeling sick or depressed. It never fails to make me feel better! The catchy tunes are beautifully sung by the talented Judy Garland. Among them are ""The Boy Next Door"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"". The uncomplicated problems of the Smith family are a great escape from the complex lives that modern people lead."
1,Missing sound,"Large portions of this, specifically all Judy Garland's singing, is missing. Very disappointing! The picture is grainy but considering when this was originally made I have no problem with picture quality but missing sound is not acceptable."
1,Poor Recording,"The quality of the recording is poor. You can hear flutter in the string passages, which is 90% of Mantovani's music! There is also hiss noise, and pops in piece transitions... Amateur transcription from tape to CD's, is my guess. Someone else made bad reviews regarding the poor recording on the same record label, so my suggestion is to stay away from the label Madacy Records."
4,Good resource,"This was used in a psychology course and is a useful resource for child development. I only recieved 2 out of the 3 CDs, the CDs are useful to actually watch concepts in action."
2,Somewhat lacking,"I found this documentary lacking in a number of ways. While I would not describe it in any way as propaganda, it's really just a video about what Unarius's believes, teaches, and some of their history. There is little to no discussion about faith or how the organization has coped with it's failed prophecies or other demonstrably false claims that have been made. The description of this film says it is ""a sympathetic look at faith and how people justify it in different ways"", however, I found no exploration of how people justify faith in the eccentric beliefs taught by Unarius."
3,Sophistication,"Anyone reading my reviews knows I am beating down the path of the ""So you want to start wearing cologne"" guide on Amazon.com. To be fair, I purchased this one in the mini-size. This is clearly the most sophisticated of all the colognes I have bought and reviewed, as are most of the colognes that boast a blend of sage and tobacco. This is a good cologne to have around for job interviews or places dealing with authority I suppose, but not recommended for teens or for clubbing etc... I put a few dabs on at first and could hardly make out the scent, then I put more on to finally get a sense of it. It is overall very light, has high notes of citrus that quickly dissipate leaving a more bassy musk. This cologne probably works more at the subconcious level as it is not overly bright or attention grabbing. I'll quote my wife as saying ""...eh..(shrug)..."". I at least intend to stick with the mini and put it on for grad school interviews or if I'm just bored for change in scent."
5,Have you ever been in heaven?,"If no, then you will definitely experience this feeling with Dolce&Gabbana Eau de Toilette.. My dad, my boyfriend, two of my cousins are using it as an everyday luxury keeping my mom, me and two of my cousins' wives in heaven.. This perfume is the best money can buy! Strongly recommend!"
5,Great Product!,"Smells great. Period! Never leaving my apt without a spray. At night, I use 5-6 sprays. Ladies loves it and your friends will be jealous."
2,Bug spray,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and the nose.Every time I wear this my wife and son complain. Too strong. Acrid. Bug spray"
4,Dolce&Gabbana for men,I have been very satisfied with this fragrance which I believe has a very distinctive scent that always intrigues others and ask for its name. The 4.2 oz. size is very manageable.
4,"Good Knife, almost perfect","Nice,solid, and inexpensive knife. The only thing wrong is the awkward opening. You can open it on the hem of your pants, but it's tricky to open in your hand with only your thumb. But, it's possible with practice. I love it."
5,Best knife I have ever had,I have used this knife to cut cardboard and all types of stuff you're not supposed cut and I can shave with this thing it's great
5,Fantastic 12 inch figure of Babe Ruth,The 12 inch Babe Ruth figure is beautifully done by McFarlane. Great detail in the Babe's face and uniform are displayed in the realistic pose of Ruth watching a home run. The 12 inch figures are great for display and have much more presence than the smaller ones.
3,Something Different,"I sat absolutely mesmerized through the first two tapes of this series. I thought it was one of the most intriguing ""different"" stories I had ever watched. Kristin Scott Thomas was wonderful in the lead role and the story line was fascinating. But sadly, I was disappointed with the third part. (Don't read on if you haven't seen it). I found it completely unbelievable that she would make her focus to get laid. Being a nun all those years, I could not accept that she would throw herself at a man who treated her like dirt. It was not in line with her character at all. Not believable. However, I still recommend this series. Its not typical in any way and therefore enjoyable."
3,A New Yanni!,I have been a fan of Yanni's for years until I ran across Bradley Joseph's music (Yanni's former keyboardist). If you like Yanni you will LOVE Bradley as he writes beautiful melodies and takes music were Yanni left off. Check him out at http;//www.bradleyjoseph.com
3,Causes boot problem,"My only real problem with this drive is that after I installed it, I started having problems cold booting PC (a Dell desktop running Win XP Home Edition SP 2). It gets to the Dell world logo screen (before Windows attempts to open) and freezes. I have to turn it off and on repeatedly before it will finally boot up. I saw one reviewer mention getting the Blue Screen of Death (due to a memory dump). Well, I got one of those too the other day. Shiver.I'm going to try to update the firmware, but I'm not hopeful."
3,"It worked great for about 6 months, but I put it through a lot","This drive worked great for about 6 months. Then the read and write speeds took a dive, and then soon to follow it wouldn't read the discs everytime i would put them in, or it would take a while. Finally now after about 3 years, it has completely stopped working. It closed one fateful day, never to open its drive again. It's jammed. It burned me probably about 400 dvd's though. Thats pretty good... worth the money i'd say"
5,Sony DRU-810A,"it does not allow me to view the movie on my pc after burning, though i can see it on a stand alone dvd player. does it have some kind of secret thing to know? i cannot review the product favorably as long as i cannot fully use it."
4,Works but still took a while,To install this and to make it work took surprisingly longer than I expected. It took much more work to change the front Bezel than I expected. And to install it was even more work. First my Bay is too long (I have a Dell Dimension 4500) so it doesn't fit correctly because it is too short!! But it still works. Second It took me a while to find the jumper that was already attached then I put it in the wrong spot. I can't wait to test it but I sure hope it works after all this work. I think that it will work but if you don't want to do alot of work to get it in then I don't recommed this product
3,Unpleasant surprises about Nero,"I have no complaint about the unit, which installed easily and works well. I do, however, have beefs about Nero, which technically does fulfill its obligation to support the DVD drive, but only just barely. First, I discovered that there were conflicts between Nero and another driver I was using with a CD burner, so I had to de-install that. Then I found out (from Sony) that, if I want to rip a CD to mp3, I need to pay Nero extra $$ for a plug-in module! (Fortunately, freeware and shareware rippers are available on the internet.) Finally, I discovered that Nero supports ONLY the DVD player; I cannot use it to drive my CD burner without again paying Nero extra $$. In short, the makers of Nero have deliberately crippled this version of the program in order to extract more money from you. Be careful."
2,Color this book beige,"While there is some real color information that might help someone trying to learn to use color, there are may questions answered that see ""fluffy"" and not relevant - e.g. ""Are women better at choosing color than men?"" or ""Are newborn boys and girls born with a differnt sense of color?"" or ""Can some people actually see auras?"" If you're an artist or a teacher, there are much better books on color. This one has too much color gossip."
5,Collector's Edition Boxed Set Elvis '68 Special,Great for a Elvis Collector as I gave to a Elvis collector as a gift. WAS VERY PLEASED AND THRILLED
3,I returned it.,"The necklace was nice, but when I got it, there were signs of wear, and rust, looked like ""used"" to me, so I returned it. The chains tend to mingle up in one another."
3,Upgrade and a bow to superior knowledge!,"Based on Jeff Ellwood's assessment, I'm upgrading my rating for this book by a full star as blood is likely thicker than admiration."
1,Most of these guitarists sound the same to me.,"I have to say that I find this record incredibly boring to listen to. A collection of virtually unknown guitarists (except Vai and Freedman) that are literally all copying what Jason Becker did (and many others) in the eighties did a long, long time ago. There is only so much you can get from sweeping arpeggios and speed picking before the listener gets bored. One track on this CD by Daniele Liverani is embarrassing. To speak about Jason as being some kind of guitar god on this style of play is an incredibly stupid statement. To sum up, Steve Vai is the only original musician performing on this record and his track is fantastic. As for most of the other players, they all seem to sound like they are copying each other, and I couldn't see any of them being big on their own, as there is absolutely nothing original about their styles of play."
2,This CD is okay but I wouldn't say great.,"If these are some of the 'best guitarists around of the moment', then I only wish we could go back to the Seventies/Eighties. Like the first review, there isn't exactly anything of highlighted originality going on here. Unless your knowledge of guitaring is limited that is."
1,Nothing mind blowing on this.,"I have listened to this CD 3 times now and cannot find anything different to it to what I have heard in the past. The rock tracks on the CD are good, but the guitar compositions have nothing exciting about them. Vinnie Moore and Tony Macalpine were playing a lot of this type of material nearly 20 years ago and to be frank I would rather listen to their old albums then this hyped up rubbish."
3,My Bloody Hand....,"When I first saw this movie I was reminded of ""The Crawling Hand"" (1963) about an astronauts severed hand seeking revenge on the living. Overall ""The Hand"" is a decent horror flick and the best part is Michael Caine. It's his acting that makes this movie an above average horror flick. Does it deserve to be released on DVD? Why not. You could do a lot worse.If you have seen this movie, FIND and rent the SCTV DVD disc Volume 2 - Disc 2, that spoofs this very movie. Dave Thomas does a hilarious parody of Michael Caine's character complete with cockney accent in SCTV's ""My Bloody Hand"". It's definately worth renting if you've seen ""The Hand""."
4,"Not the best in the series, but far from disappointing","Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan continue their adventures together in Jude Watson's second installment in the Jedi Apprentice series, this time as Master and Padawan. They must overcome dangerous odds and face off against a ruthless and powerful faction in total control of a planet. Obi-Wan really shows special talents in this title, and it is yet another interesting look into the bond between Jedi, especially at this critical early stage in the relationship.Unfortunately, however, this book just seemed to lack the uniqueness of the others. It is exciting, but almost all the other books contain life-changing or crucially important events for the Jedi. This seems like just another mission. It does leave you wanting to read The Mark of the Crown, though."
2,This series tends to get worse with every book.,"That was OK, but I like to see more force powers in a book thatfollows Jedi Knights. Obi Wan's friends were immature, GROSSLYincompetent, and stupid. Obi Wan is as gullible as ever, and parsecs from the confident, self assured character I knew from the movies and the other, better books that I read. CLEARLY written down to small children in a way that is borderline offensive. There were points during this book that I wanted to scream, ""I PASSED MY FIRST GRADE READING COMPREHENSION TEST!"" Buy the Young, or Junior Jedi Knights instead, you'll thank me later."
5,"One of my favorites, a great book!","After two unofficial missions, Qui-Gon Ginn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are officially Master and Padawan. Jedi Master Yoda has sent them to Gala to oversee elections for a new ruler. The journey promises to be exciting due to Prince Beju who has all ready been promised the throne. But on their way to Gala, disaster strikes. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan have been hijacked to the planet Phindar! The Syndicat lords are in charge on Phindar and if they find an enemy, they do a very cruel thing: they erase their memory! The Master and Padawan have made some new friends and they are trying to help them overthrow the Syndicat. The journey becomes even more mysterious when the Jedi learn that Prince Beju is aiding the Syndicat in their diabolical plans. But after Obi-Wan is captured by the Syndicat, Qui-Gon and his friends must be careful because on Phindar, one wrong step can lead to disaster and certain doom!"

4,Quick delivery but,Arrived quickly the only issue was the clear plastic packaging made the bottom right hand corner of the book dog ear facing outward for the first ten pages. Not sure if it was the sellers fault or not but other than that - perfect!
5,great,this was a gift for students give them to many people.really a great gift thanks so very very very much. Thanks thanks thanks thanks
2,"Svankmajer is Great, This Edition has Poor Video Quality","The actual content I would give 4 stars, however, I found the video quality of this edition to be very poor. I remember watching many of these on thetwo volume collected shortsedition and remember much better video quality. So out of dissapointment, I returned this edition to Amazon."
5,the best of the best,"Just got the vacuum cleaner droped off, put it together witch just took 5 minutes, and started to clean the house and i was amazed how well it works, just in one pass and everything was picked, not like with my canister vacuum where i would have to pass two or more times, i was pleased on how well it works, and so were my grandparents who are in there 80's they havent seen one of these cleaners in a long time, i did get the model 1934b instead of the model 1934a witch i was expecting to receive, but I'm happy with the model B, its just the color thats different the power is the same."
2,Its been a year!,"So we've had this vacuum cleaner for a bit over a year now. It was purchased September 8, 2009.Currently, my wife is complaining that the vacuum is not providing enough suction to pick up the dirt. The bag in the back was emptied so we know that's not the problem. Time is going to be spent trying to figure out what's wrong with it, and it may be finished das far as I know.My impression of the vacuum over time hasn't been that great. It performed rather poorly on hardwood flooring from the start, and I can't say I was overly impressed on carpet. It's clunky to move around, and when the bag approaches full it tends to tip over."
5,Excellent bang for the buck!,"Vacuum is light, cheap, and has no frills. However, it does what it is supposed to do and that is suck! If you are looking for a fancy great looking vacuum that will impress your neighbors, then buy something else. If you are looking for a plain, inexpensive vacuum that actually works then buy this machine. Is it better than a $1000 vacuum...Nope, but this thing beats the heck out of the $200 Wally world vacuums!"
3,Big and Heavy,"Best you knew: It's about 12.5"" high and 10.5"" deep, and weighs like a couple of bricks. The pages are an unusually heavy stock. It also tends to be rather dry in spots; at least I found it so. It seems to be especially for fans who are ready for absolutely anything Python; it's not as snappy as their films and shows. But don't ignore the other reviews."
2,Long and Overdrawn,"I just finished reading this book and I could not wait for it to be over. Several times I was going to give up but had to finish to see how it ended. I skipped over many pages due to the long drawn out writing that I found simply uninteresting. Charlotte Simmons is far from the ordinary college student. While I agree that Tom Wolfe did get some views of college life correctly, I don't believe he purveyed it in the correct light. If you want to be truly bored and read a book that lacks interest, this is the book for you. Lots of drama but really no plot."
1,For the vicarious types,"Having gone to college in 70s and having three children, one just graduated from U. of Mich., I eagerly awaited the ""eye opening"" novel of modern college life by one of my favorite writers.What did I find; boring, verbose, uninformative novel. I am glad that college life through the eyes and research of Mr. Wolfe has been tamed since my days in college. The novel was so hard to read. One feels that the overly descriptive verbosity of Mr. Wolfe's characters dilemmas are for the sole purpose of making the book longer than need be.The novel is predictable in every sense with no suspense.My main question is why did he need to do so much research to write this garbage?"
4,Dad's review,"I've read most of Tom Wolfe's books. I enjoyed his description of the small town girl trying to cope with the rigors of college social/intellectial life. The plot brought out a great deal of personal anxiety thinking about my daughters college experience fifteen years ago.It makes me wish I had home schooled my daughter through college. I do believe his description of current college life is correct.Mr. Wolfe's character development is excellent as always, but his long winded descripions of current language usage goes on too long.I highly recomend this book."
1,what was that about?,"i could not finish it.there's absolutely no way i could finish it.so i got my mom read it for me.where does this charlotte come from? mars? holy cow!all this nagging about everything.gee! i just wanna shout"" get over it charlotte!"" you could easily skip couple chapters and still got the idea. to those who has read it, don't you just wanna shoot this adam guy? and to those who hasn't, forget about it!by the way,please don't make a move out of this book!"
4,Voyeuristic fun,"A peek into the life of a smart but naive college girl. Wolfe seems to dig deep into the insecurities and nuances of high school and college life. The petting ""scenes"" were very visual and a little embarrassing read aloud. (but fun)"
1,Waste of good printing ink and paper.,"Good luck finding a complete and interesting plot in this wandering yawner... poor Charlotte, a victim of her creator."
2,One sentence review,"This is the literary equivalent to an old man standing in his yard, fist shaking, yelling, ""Damn you kids!"""
1,One word to describe this book: bloated,"SOMEWHERE in the publishing world, there must be an editor with the guts to tell Tom Wolfe:1. He needs to cut this book by at least 30%.2. The first time he uses a metaphor (""winking navels""), it may be clever; the second time it may be a slip up; the third time it becomes a cliche; the fourth time, annoying.3. Placing the same event in different settings (a dorm room, a frat house, a tail gate party) doesn't make it unique each time.4. People don't plow through 675 pages for a ""happy ever after"" ending.5. Stereotypes are boring."
2,Less Than Fair,"Mr. Wolfe's effort ,this time, misses the mark. He is always very readable but the substance of this effort is far below his previous standards. The prose is good and the story is somewhat compelling but , in the end I felt as hollow as many of the characters he created. His portrayal of the students of DuPont U. does not ring true to any college student I know (and I do know quite a few). He paints his portraits of his characters in broad strokes and seems to find no one of substance. I was very disappointed in this book."
1,Probably my last Tom Wolf book,I am 3/4's of the way through and it has yet to grab my interest. I am weary of reading about frat dullards.
1,hmmm....1 star is the lowest?,"I am Charlotte Simmons is a waste of paper, ink, time and money. Enough to make me want to gag and ruin my own personal promise to NOT Read drek and finish any book I have started, this is the worst drek ever...badder than any Romance Novel. Tom Wolfe is the ultimate huckster, selling this gigantic collection of poorly written, completly immoral stories based on nothing to an audience of willing consumers. We should file a class action suit against the author and publisher."
1,don't waste your time,This book was extremely disappointing. The first third of the book was interesting and made you keep reading to discover how the characters would develop. Unfortunately they did not develop and instead spiraled further into their own stereotypes. By the end of the book you feel very cheated for having wasted countless hours on this 700 pages of college fluff that misses college characterizations completely. Skip this book and read Mr. Wolfe's more worthy novels.
5,Great novel -- Not great reporting,"Tom Wolfe has not captured the essence of college life the way he captured the essence of the Merry Pranksters in the Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, but since this is fiction, the more important question is whether the college world that he created, and the characters who populate it, are worth reading about, and in that regard, Tom Wolfe succeeded brilliantly."
3,Nitpicking,"With so many reviews already posted I just want to point out some unrealistic elements in I am Charlotte Simmons which I enjoyed. But I was dissappointed that a sharp observer such as Wolfe does not even know that a college basketball game has only has two halves and not four quarters. At least twice he mentions quarters in a college basketball game. There are no quarters in a college basketball game! It is also unrealistic that there would no activity planned for freshmen on their first night on campus. At one point the novel seems confused whether it is November or December and the time line goes back and forth. Also almost every school has finals before Christmas break, but not Dupont apparently and there was no break between semesters. These minor flaws impair the realism of the novel. But overall it was a fun read and many of the observations are spot on."
1,TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"Having read and enjoyed all of the author's previous work I anticpated this book with pleasure. But, alas, this sophomoric over written, padded, volume is a monument to the notion that"" you cant win 'em all "". The story line is essentially non existent. The dialogue is jejeune and offensive at the same time.The satire is overblown and not at all funny. In a real sense it is an insult to our best centers of higher education. The never ending expletives, the repetitive descriptions of athlete's muscle bound moronity, the prolonged passages devoted to wild, drunken, sex oriented parties are totally boring.In short I regard this effort as a piece of c--p. Tom, where is your wit when we need it the most?"
5,Importance of prayer,Rachel's short prayer was frequently repeated all during this novel when the character needed encouragement in a difficult situation. Prayer today can be a powerful weapon against evil rampant in our world. Prayer is something that is private or spoken privately between a person and God.
1,DVD-system of Sometimes in April,Name of the DVD : Sometimes in April. The DVDsystem of this DVD is not used in Europe.So I can't watch this video in Europe. I can recommend this DVD to customers with DVD-systems usual in the USA.
5,sometimes in april,its better than hotel rwanda and other movies about the genocide and worth the time to watch
3,"Powerful, Must-See Movie","Deeply unsettling portrayal of Rwandan genocide. Strong performances by entire cast -- very believable. Slow paced at times. Liked HOTEL RWANDA better -- more suspenseful. How can such horrors be ignored repeatedly by major powers in Africa, Europe, Asia, & the Americas? A must see."
5,For anyone tired of simple plots & 1 dimensional characters,"As a mystery reader, I have found it increasingly difficult to find new authors with a more sophisticated style that challenges the reader. This book kept me up late reading for several nights because I needed to know what would develop next. I highly recommend this book to lovers of complex characters. The author has a great ability get the tone of each character exactly right. When reading the parts from the 6yr old character's perspective, I was hearing a real child's thoughts and fears. Read this book if you are tired of all the simple plots and one dimensional characters. The author's characters remind me of those in Ian Rankin's Rebus books. You will remember this book!"

3,Better Midler - The Divine Better Midler,I thought it was good butI expected a bit more music video rather than the biography which is really what it is. While interesting I would not watch this very often or at all again.I would like to add that I would love to buy Diva Las Vegas which I have not seen available in this country.
4,"good, but ripped...","I got this for my rat terrier mix. When i first got her, she was picky with toys, but liked the rattle sound. I had a very hard time finding a dog toy that rattled in the stores. My dog loved this toy. The only problem was that the witches' nose tore after about 3 weeks and the stuffing started coming out. It can be sewn back up, so it's not the biggest deal. I would still recommend this toy."
2,How did this get to Cannes?,The Sleeping Beauty Movie was disappointing. I wish I had read some reviews before renting this movie. Alas how it garnered 4 stars is beyond me. Disjointed with many fade to black scenes. The ending isn't. Another dead end. Is she dead or alive? You get to figure it out.Wish I had saved the time for something more useful.
3,Swing and a miss,"I was very interested in this. Was expecting a Kubrick style movie, which I think they attempted, but failed.They seemed to inject odd scenes just because they seemed ""off-beat"" but had no relevance to the film. The lead is sexy, but a little bland.There were points where we were laughing at some scenes."
2,Pretty but dull...,"I rented this film because it apparently did well at Cannes. On the plus side it was beautifully shot. On the down side, it was dull. The subject was intriguing but I found I didn't care about anyone in the movie. Where I should feel sympathy, I didn't. Where I should be shocked, I wasn't. Everyone just meandered through their existences. There was no redeeming vale to the main character. An apathetic creature. My goodness, she was a terrible friend. Perhaps that was the intent of the movie. She had no emotion until the end of the movie, and then it was out of character. I'm sure there will be those who will enjoy this film, but I'm not one of them. Yawn!"
2,I Don't Get It,"This movie kept me guessing before, during and after. It was extremely disappointing in the end. I just didn't get it. It wasn't worth the $1.99 I spent to rent it."
2,Really disappointed,"The best thing about this movie is that it really showcases Emily Browning's talent as an actress. The story line is hard to follow and leaves a number of scenes unexplained as to their relevance to the story; I lost count of how many times I found myself saying ""What the...?"" as I watched it. I like screenplays that don't overstate the obvious and leave a little bit left to interpretation, but this was too much to keep up with at times."
1,Makes You Wanna Weep for the Poor Funeral Director...,"Poorly edited and overpriced. ""Death Through the Eyes of a Funeral Director"" should be entitled ""Why You should Feel Sorry For Your Poor Funeral Director"". I've never read anything so insincere in my life. The author attempts to portray himself as unconcerned with profits, overworked and put upon, his only concern for the family of the deceased. He complains of a lack of sleep, has the audacity to scold family members for arguing over a casket, tells how he ""rushed"" the obituary to the paper and wants symapthy for his poor, tired overworked staff. I would have appreciated a bit more honesty but then I'd like to buy a reliable used car too."
1,Don't Buy It!!,"I purchased the MGM Midnight Movies DVD Double Feature ""The Abominable Dr Phibes"" and ""Dr Phibes Rises Again"". Both sides of the DVD froze after the 11 second MGM Logo at the very beginning. Wiping with a dust cloth did not help (needless to say). I ordered a replacement from Amazon and, not to my surprise, THAT DVD did the same thing. It froze and wouldn't play on either side after the 11 second MGM Logo introduction. There is definitely a crooked operation going on somewhere. But what really surprises me is Amazon is still selling this after I informed them!!! (I had to put in one star because the computer INSISTED I rate it.)"
4,Nice Mix,"If you are a Vincent Price fan & know anything about his acting background you will enjoy this fun mix of films. Look for some outstanding supporting actors and the ""Phibes"" movies are truly just diabolical fun!"
4,The first one is better,"The original is definitely the better end of this bargain, but I couldn't find it in a single DVD, only combination wise. Good deal for your cash."
1,"Great films, AWFUL DVDs!","This DVD will not play on my DVD player. I get the MGM logo, and then it hangs when trying to load the menu screen. This is not the first time I've had this problem with MGM DVDs. If you purchase this, make sure there is an ironclad return policy in place."
1,A Couple Hours I'll Never Get Back,"Simply one of the worst books I've read in a long time. Smith's writing style is cumbersome, him making use all too frequently of fractured sentences. Don't be fooled by the so-called suspense or mystery as to the Charis character's motives....you can see this one coming after a couple of chapters (if not sooner). I mean come now...how many motives can there be for a this Charis woman of whom we have no backround suddenly start killing Joanna's (...)? And what's with Smith's odd fascination with women peeing, both him writing it and the characters talking about it? Who cares? Skip this one and move on."
1,good sensor gone bad?,"After about 10 ueses, the display reads 199 degrees no matter what I do. I tried resetting, changing batteries -- no change."
2,Great if it works,"We had this thermometer for one summer. When we first got it, we were thrilled. It tells you when the meat it done so you don't overcook it on the grill. However, after about 3 months of moderate use (I think we used it about once every 1-2 weeks), it just died. We tried to reset it, changed the batteries, etc., but nothing worked. It would turn on, but it wouldn't read a temperature. We finally threw it away. For $30, I expected it to last longer than it did, but for the short time it did work, it worked great."
1,Very Disappointing,"I received this item for my birthday. Initially, it was difficult to set up, and a little confusing. I got it working, and it seemed good. After about 20 minutes with the probe in the meat in the grill, it started going crazy, saying everything was overcooked. I checked it, and it seems the wire had melted. it had not been misused at all, I used it exactly as the manufacturer suggest I use it (on my Weber grill no less), and it melted into uselessesness."
4,Super convenenient way to have your meat done right,"I purchased this product for my husband for Father's Day. We had a battery operated fork that you used to tell if things were done, and after 5 years and many battery changes it only worked some times.The convenience of putting the probe in one time before all the juices are leaking, and then not having to keep checking the barbecue is well worth it.My only slight disappointment was that we set the thermometer for rare when making a thick steak and when it beaped it was more what I consider medium.Would buy this again....real handy tool!"
2,Works great for first 5 times,I am a Weber fan I have a Summit(Gas)and Weber Bullet Smoker which are FANTASTIC! I was really impressed at first with this unit because I could go to bed and cook my Pork [...] and wake every 3-4 hours and read the temperature from the comfort of my bedroom. Going into the fifth time I used this; it quit. I've tried another one and the same thing happen? I'm shocked that Weber would have a quality control issue. If you can get one of these to work for a reasonable amount of time I would buy one again. Now I have to check the traditional way.
1,Piece of junk,"I can't believe Weber put their name on this piece of junk. It worked two or three times (maybe). Since then it doesn't indicate a correct temperature, or simply goes to 199 degrees instantly. The way it is set up (with reset buttons on both units to synchronize the units) is a joke. Lousy design, inaccurate - I would seriously look for something else."
1,"Weber ""Professional-Grade"" JOKE","If you're looking for a decent digital thermometer to cook various items I'd recommend buying this one is you'll only use it once. After that, this thermometer will fail to tell you the current temperature of what you're cooking. PLUS, if you're looking for a thermometer to alert you once the meat heats to a specific temperature that you desire, you'll need to look elsewhere. The fine folks at the Weber company, apparently, don't trust your ability to gauge what temperature corresponds with your desired level of doneness. This thermometer will only alert you on four levels with Beef and one on all other meats. So, again, this is a $35 let down and a word of advice for the Weber company: stick to making grills!"
1,Stopped Working after 10 minutes. Customer Service no Help,"I used this for about 10 minutes, then it kept reading 199F. The thermostat stopped working, even though the probe was at room temp. Even a few days later it worked the same, kept reading 199F. Called customer service and they said to use the reset buttons by the battery in compartment. It didn't work. Then they were no help. Bottom line, reading the rest of the reviews, this product is not fit for consumer distribution."
2,Do Not Buy,"I am giving this two stars because it is so great while it works. But my probe failed after a month or so. I am a sucker and loved this item and went and bought another one at the local store. And, again, probe failure after a a month or two. Do not buy this. Weber you are a great company; shame on you for putting your name on this."
3,Mine too failed but Weber is sending redesigned probe,"I have a 16 year old Weber grill and had to replace a part two years ago. I was extremely pleased with the friendly service I received when I called Weber. Earlier this year I received the Weber Digital Thermometer as a gift. It failed the 2nd time I used it. I just called Weber and spoke with a most helpful lady named Cindy. She informed me Weber has redesigned the proble and they will send me one. She also indicated I need to be sure I don't crimp the cable when I use the probe (as can happen if you lower the grill's lid onto the cable). Like others, I think this digital thermometer is a great idea and I hope this replacement probe corrects the problem. At any rate, I am still impressed with the friendly support folks at Weber."
2,Junk,"This unit is great when it works. The trouble is that it never works. In my case, the remote unit doesn't recognize the sending unit at about 20 feet.I've used mine about 3 times and it stopped working. I can't believe that I paid almost $50 for this thing."
3,Works great until probe fails - no replacement!,"I have had one of these for 3 years. It worked really well. Then, the probe burned out (I think I pushed it too far into thin meatand it hit the grill rack); it shows 199 degrees - so I assume this means the probe is bad.You cannot buy a new probe! This is absurd. If any product should allow you to replace a part, this is it. But, I have had a lot of success with it until now (3 years).Note that if you have something else which transmits at 433MHz, do not get it. This product cannot tolerate interference from something else - no special band hopping or anything."
5,Big fan of Nolo ... and there is a reason why,"I'm a big fan of Nolo Press, and this 2009 tax guide is no exception. Directed to professionals in solo or group practice (e.g., engineers, lawyers, chiropractors), this book is a good overview of entitled tax deductions. Perfect for those starting out in business for themselves. However, for those who have been in business for a number of years, much of the information should be old hat. Nevertheless, the number of examples and details, in everyday language, makes this a ""must look"" the next time you browse books at a B&M store."
5,Nice.,"Haven't used it for fishing yet since it is winter here, but it's pretty good quality for a bass lure."
4,Hungarian Movie,This movie is worth seeing. A bit of insight into Hungary's past using the situation of one husband and wife and his elderly mother.
2,Heavy study,"Heavy as in ponderous. The questions in this study are difficult to answer, don't point towards the scripture or toward God and take way too long with too little result. I am very disappointed in both the book and the study. Each lesson is approximately 15 pages of tedious questions that are impossible to answer honestly. It is obvious that John MacArthur wrote the whole thing to direct people to certain conclusions. UGH! I don't recommend it and will only continue because of my commitment to my group."
1,Read this book only if you don't like women,"This book is a NOT a book about extraordinary women. This is a book about women in the Bible and the extraordinary men in their lives. We used the book for a women's bible study at my church and none of us wanted to finish it. For instance, the best thing he can say about the giggling Sara is the fact that she's married t Abraham. Sad.Skip this read. Unless you want women to aspire to great husbands and nothing more."
1,amusing,"One reviewer, Bruce H, in agreeing with Windschuttle remarks ""Windschuttle makes his case..."". This makes me laugh in the context of an attempt to vindicate universal truth."
5,Superb work for anyone interested in how history is being rewritten.,"Professor Windschuttle exposes the dangers of using structuralism, poststructuralism, postmodernism, cultural relativism and the like as tools for doing history. By quoting extensively from those he takes issue with, taking time to clarify the mumbo-jumbo used by some of these theorists, and explaining his reasoning and conclusions in plain English, the author has made it vastly simpler for the average person to comprehend these radical approaches and why they are so dangerous to truth. One could write more, but it would only be restating much of what has already been said."
3,okay....,"Service was crap. The book took forever to get to me, and it wad wrapped in a paper grocery bag. The book is new. Quality of the book is great but the processing is the issue."
2,Very Depressing and Anger Filled Book,"I respect the author and was sympathetic to her struggle. However, this book was so filled with anger that I had to stop reading it. Prejudice, whether against all fat people, all black people, all gay people, is heinous and warrants anger, but I needed to get to the part where she grew emotionally from her struggle. I have no time for Bitterness, this is a toxic emotion and leads to illness.So, instead of this one, read Fat?So! and read The Fat Girl's Guide to Life. those are awesome, funny, and empowering for those of us who have struggled our whole lives with the delusion, forced upon us by society, that what we weigh actually matters. Who you are matters, not what you weigh, and the only way to overcome prejudice is with humor and dignity.Also the book,Such a Pretty Fat is okay (not great, but definitely okay), and I'm Not the New Me, at least is neutral, not angry, and is a good book. Stay far away from bitter books."
4,Relaxed!,"I tried this DVD for the first time today (since it took Amazon more than 5 days to ship it to me). I've done yoga before so this DVD was not very difficult but it did make me sweat. I like that the dvd has litle segments (10-15 minutes each) that you can pick from - good breathing, meditation, circulation, balancing, or relaxation techniques. I have some balancing issues from my immune system attacking parts of my brain two months ago. I was able to do the segments without losing balance and I felt better afterwards. My kids(ages 9 & 13)even did the dvd with me without my asking them to do it. I felt relaxed after doing the dvd. I like the segments because you can do all of them if you have time or pick and choose on other days when you don't have time. Ok - this is really superficial but I didn't rate it a 5 star because of the way the instructor was dressed and at some parts I couldn't hear her because the music was louder than her voice."
4,like it alot...if you like the movie..you will love the dvd,It was exactly what it WAS. The movie...each song with narration from the movie...bought it for one song lol...but liked the whole thing..a lot of bad language but it's rapp so...like it alot...loved the movie MORE!! LOVE THAT MOVIE.
1,"One, maybe two good songs.","This is a pretty empty album. Beside the ""Shinobi..."" song, which really rocks out, I was very displeased by the remainder of the songs. The music felt stagnant, and really lacked direction. To be honest, I think these guys are just trying to sound like their contemporaries. They don't bring anything new to the table that we haven't heard elsewhere. If I could return the CD I bought, I would. (one more reason to download music from the net)"
4,I'm BBBBAAACCCCKKKKK!,"S'up all... After a short break of leave I am back to write some more reviews. I have to say, this album is (sort of) what the Gorillaz album should have sounded like. Very experimental, but at the same time have some decent music. I first discovered them while I was in England (during my ""leave of absence"" I toured the world, pretty cool huh) I saw them in concert and thought how good the music is even though it isn't metal. I really thought that their presentation just plain out [rocked]. But some of the songs were a bit too choppey. But in the long run, it wasn't that band of an album. It gets da seal."
1,This Sucks,I love lostprophets at least i love start something i bought that and its probably the best cd i have i can never get sick of that every song is awesome and then today i was all like woah! they have another cd an older one and then i got it and it sucks it sucks bad im glad they changed their style if they stayed with this i would not buy anymore of their stuff but hey lostprophets are the best! (just not the old lostprophets)
5,BUY THIS NOW!!!,"I cannot recommend this CD wholeheartedly enough. Every single song on here is worth listening to over and over, but ""Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja,"" ""The Fake Sound of Progress,"" ""The Handsome Life of Swing,"" ""Awkward"" and ""Ode to Summer"" were my favorites. It's kind of hard to describe this group's sound. (Although many are just calling them nu metal) At times, it's just straight up rock, whereas at other times they sound... different. Like what would happen if Incubus got together with Adema, Linkin Park and Hoobastank. Whatever. Stop reading this and click ""buy"" now..."
5,So glad i got to the concert early!,"The first time i heard them was in november at a Linkin Park concert they where suporting and i had to go buy there album the next day, they are great. There music is real and cool. It mixes so many different things together and each song is different unlike some other bands. i have seen them twice now and each time there mosh pits have been great and so cool and im seeing them at reading festival! go buy this album it is fantastic, you should really give them a go. All i can say is im SO glad i got to the concert early to hear them!!!"
5,AWESOME,"The title says it all, this was my 1st vacuum and I don't regret that decision! I have two pets who shed ALOT and this vacuum comes with all the accessories and more that I need to clean up! The cost is pretty up there, but once you own a dyson, you begin to wonder what you were doing without one. The suction resembles that of a shop vac, it's easy to use, and virtually picks up any hard to get mess."
2,Not thrilled,"For the price, the vacuum doesn't do the greatest. Very heavy and awkward to handle. Replaced this vacuum with another, more light weight and better suction and less expensive."
5,Best vacuum I EVER OWNED,"I highly recommend this vacuum. It is easy to use, and picks up ALL of the dirt! The swivel mechanism is convenient. This machine is easy to take apart & clean, put back together & use."
5,TroyBuilt is a great saw,"Bought this TroyBuilt used. Recently, we had a wet heavy snow and a lot of trees fell in the neighborhood. The neighbor's crabapple tree was mostly in my back yard so I asked if he had a chain saw. A few hours, he came back with a TroyBuilt chain saw and I cut up most of the tree branchs. He offered me the saw for $40.00 since it was running rough, I took it to a small engine shop for an overhaul. Cost me $67 for the rebuilt carb and a new chain.The manual says MDT and the parts list says McCalloch. So it might be a party to corporate buyouts. Anyways, after filling the tank with gas/oil mix and chain lube, a 4 push prime and 4 pulls to get the gas mixture through the carb. A second 4 pulls got the engine started and idle for about 20 seconds.Cut the branch to 12"" rounds and hopefully, next fall, we'll have a nice fire in the fireplace."
3,"Good data, but OCR needs work.","The genealogical work in this text was excellent. I had seen the hard text before and knew the amount of detailed data in it. However, when the book was scanned the optical character recognition (OCR) had some problems. Some letters were recognized incorrectly, which was a problem for some names, but created significant difficulties when it misread the generational indicator."
2,Green Card,This book was not any help at all. It did not say anything that we haven't already done. Nothing new.
5,Verb Book review,This is a must when you want to learn to put the proper tenses to the verb. It is very easy to read. I use the CD periodically to test how much I've retained. Taking the reviews on the CD is a very good gauge of your progress.
1,Vague and useless,"A friend gave me this book saying he liked it a lot ... upon reading it I found it to be full of vague comparisons and simplistic nonsense.This is the kind of book that trivializes often complex problems, creates comparisions that are utterly meaningless and claims that these techniques solve all of ones problems. As an example there is some place where conciousness is compared to a movie screen. As an exercise I replaced screen with ""camera"" and come up with equally sappy nonsense. I tried this with other words always with the same result. And the whole book is written in a similar spirit.Overall, pretty painful."
5,Better than most scratch boxes,"We have purchased several different brands of scratch boxes. This one is by far the best, and our cats use it the most. Other double wide scratchers have come in sections and don't fit the box very well. This is one piece of corrugated cardboard and is dense enough for our cats to really grab. They also love the little cat nip toy included in the box."
4,"Junior Sizes, Great Rash Guard Shirt","These run in junior's sizes. I figured this out by purchasing my first from a brick & mortar store and realizing a 7-8 was considered a ""medium"" They work great as a rash guard shirt and should be ordered to fit like a glove (pardon the pun) Great swim/surf shirts if you get the right size.Here's a cheat sheet to their sizing:Size XS 3-4Size S 5-6Size M 7-8Size L 9-10Size XL 11-12"
5,Great rashguard,"I love this rash guard. It's good quality. I wear a size small usually and got the small in this. It fits tight, but I like a snug fit so it's not flapping around in the water. Really helps in the cold pool where I work."
4,Harp,It's not very often there's an album with just harp music on but enjoyed listening to this one. I might well be encouraged to buy others.
4,British Sea Power,"Jackie Fisher, who bought the British navy into the 20th century with introduction of the Dreadnaught also prophisied its demise. When he saw that the battle ship could be destoyed by a cheaper weapon that was still in its early development, the airplane. He was irrasable dificult to get along with, but he was right."
5,Couldn't put it down...,"This book is hysterical! It needed to be written, although with all due respect, it probably wrote most of itself. (The truth, you know, is stranger than fiction...but not as strange as politics!)I'm passing this book on to everyone I know...it's really saite at its best, by the Post's funniest ""sometimes columnist."""
5,Excellent book ! Wonderful folkart designs.,"I think all quilters should own this book. The directions are easy and include both rotary and template patterns. The pictures of the finished designs are vibrant and beautiful. I taught a beginning quilting class and we used this as our ""textbook"". Many of the quilts featured can be completed in just a few hours. Also, my favorite part of the book is how the quilts are shown on display. These pictures offer great decorating ideas."
2,Against the current...,"I'll go against the current, here. Yes, the book depicted an unusual and interesting side of African history (hence the 2 stars), but I did not find the story itself engaging and certainly not fascinating. I guess I was expecting too much from the winner of a literary book prize. You won't be breathtaken, but you may find you know more about early East Africa than you did before you read the book."
2,Okay,"This book was entirely to long. I like the sex scenes but I think there were to many. I usually like Connie Mason books especially ""The Black Knight"". This one not so good."
3,This came out when?,"This album gets off to a great start with the amazing title track -- you'd think that a solid proto-punk album influenced by British invasion bands was on the way. Well, the sound was certainly influenced by the bands of the British invasion, but not for the better. The Groovies go on to mimic the Beatles on just about every song, finally covering the ""Misery"" near the end of the album. It's not unlistenable by any means, but it's not original, either. Everyone should be familiar with the first song, but the ones that follow are less memorable."
5,way ahead of its time,"yeah I can remember, south america wasnt ready for this record back in 1992, we were receiving the first smashing guitars from nirvana and pearl jam, and everybody thought ""the louder the better"" but not realizing what was it all about. Suddenly I heard ""dynamo"" and I have to admit that I wasnt ready either, it took me a couple of years til I heard it again, and I just knew it: gustavo and cia were at least 10 years ahead of everybody else!!. It sounds fresh, rumbling, punching (primavera 0), driving (secuencia inicial), organic at moments (claroscuro), filled with electronic gizmos and tricks, drumming loops, this is a very rewarding experience. Soda should have break up after this album came out, it was impossible to top this.Highly recommended."
4,Cerati's genius -- again.,"English-only pop-rock/alternative listeners are missing out. This Argentine trio led by guitarist/lead singer Gustavo Cerati is the pinnacle of Latin American rock. This album, although slightly less enjoyable than the later Sueño Stereo, demonstrates Cerati's penchant for experimentation -- in this case highly atmospheric production efforts w/durable synthesizer coloring. ""Secuencia Inicial"" (""Initial Sequence"") is a tremendous, albeit short, opener, while ""Nuestra Fe"" (""Our Faith"") possesses an enjoyably grating bass line throughout. ""Camaleon"" (""Chameleon"") almost seems out of place as a gleeful pop-ish item, but that just demonstrates Cerati's pleasing eclecticism."
2,"A PLOT WITH SUCH BIG HOLES IN IT, YOU CAN DRIVE A SUBMARINE THROUGH THEM","This reminds me of the crappy Pink Panther movies in comparison with the good Pink Panther movies. This is the worst Sherlock Holmes movie ever. I did watch this movie all the way through, but only because I will watch any Sherlock Holmes movie. Most everything about this feeble attempt is lame. Christopher Lee is good as Sherlock's brother, but he can't overcome the weak dialogue. The thing I like the best about Sherlock Holmes movies is all the little detecting that Sherlock does using minor clues that nobody else notices, but Billy Wilder seems to be scrupulously avoiding this integral part of the Holmes character. Holmes is not a detective in this one. This plot is implausible and silly. The principle actors are miscast. (Watch for Stanley Holloway as a grave digger) The dialogue is absurd. This is a humorless, flaccid movie."
4,Let's keep in mind that...,"...Ayn Rand had never said that personal success, if that simply means making a fortune, is the purpose of life. Happiness is the purpose of life, and achieving a happy life requires the practice of independence, productivity, honesty, integrity, and the like.Wouldn't you want all the would-be Bill Gates of the world to accept such an ethic? Or would you rather they think that success is measured solely in terms of the size of their stock portfolios?Just something to ponder."
5,From the South!!!,"I've heard his previous underground cds and I knew he had the lyrics but he took it to a whole new level on this one, the beats, lyrics, it's all bumpin, go buy it and get a better taste of the south."
5,Quotations from all the U.S. Presidents,We bought this little book to send to an out-of-town friend who expressed admiration for quotations from it which we post on an internet social networking site. The Presidential quotations cover many subjects and are for the most part still appropriate for current political events. We recommend this little book as a valuable addition to the reference section of any library.
5,A MUST read for all!!!,"This was one of the books that was a turning point in my life in 2002. It has impacted my call, my studies, my ministry and the churches I have been a member of. I highly recommend this book for any church/ministry that takes small groups seriously and highly recommend that you do not only just read it, but also take action and implement. Your people will be changed for the glory of God and your church will glorify God as well. I cannot speak highly enough of the doctrinal soundness, the prophet, priest, and kingly tones, the foundational understanding, and the excellent writing of this material. You and your small group will not be dissappointed."
5,Great Beethoven superbly played,"Beethoven's piano trios rival his magnificent set of string quartets. His mastery of balance and sound is very evident in the Op. 70 set and the Florestan Trio are perfect in their balance and in their internal commnication - they breathe as one. Their paying in the second movement which gives the Op.70/1 its name is positively ethereal.Superbly recorded, wonderfully played, this is a great disc."
5,An autobiography with intimate unprotected candor of a novel,"I first read Stop-Time when I was in college, in Boston, in 1979. Conroy has that subtle sense of the proportion of things, which one usually finds only in established writers just after the mellowing oof their careers."
5,Another great one from Bear Family,"This is the set to spring for once you find you like the greatest hits and want to know more. This is somewhat rarer material than most CD's have, but does have favorites such as ""Sleepy Eyed John"", ""One Woman Man"" and other marvelous songs. Purchase this one with confidence! Only drawback I find is the exclusion' of ""Mean, Mean Son of a Gun""! Otherwise, A-OK!"
2,Under powered,"Purchased the 200 GPH model as a replacement pump for my fountain after reading the various reviews. Before choosing this model I had read the manufacturers specifications and originally ordered this 130 GPH model which seemed would be up to the job. I was informed by the supplier after a few days that they did not infact have that pump in stock so I ordered the larger model instead assuming it would work even better. Unfortunately, that is not the case. This pump bareley provides enough flow over a 3 1/2 foot high urn style fountain even though the specs say good for up to 4 feet - even at maximum flow setting and clean piping.Would definitely suggest going to a much larger model - even twice the flow rate, and dial back if necessary to suit the need."
3,Quiet pump but stuggles in application,"Using to replace a statuary pump made in Germany which is no longer available but did a great job for the 5 years it was in use. The Beckett (M130AUL) I received looks different from the picture and is more squarish and flatter that the Beckett I ordered. It works OK but the flow rate, raising the water to a spigot 36"" above the bottom of the pump, Is barely acceptable and forces me to keep the height of the water in the bowl several inches higher than I did with the old pump. However, I will say that the pump is quieter than the pump it replaced."
5,Harley-Davidson Lover Gift,"If you love Harley-Davidson, then you love anything to do with the motorcycle. This shirt was a gift for just such a person. He loved it & wears it a lot."
3,How not to dispose of a freezer,"Volver is a restrained effort from this often flamboyant director. Unfortunately it's also one of his weakest. Uncharacteristically, Almodovar seems unsure both of himself and his themes and this is reflected in a rather flat and stunted script. None of the threads touched upon are developed enough to give the movie a true sense of direction. It is, however, redeemed somewhat by the performances. Penelope Cruz, in particular, is impressive. Overall a disappointment when compared to Almodovar's other work."
5,VOLVER,"A wonderful film, well presented on disc with excelent commantary track and worthwhile extras. It goes well with the VIVA ALMODOVAR set I bought on Ameazon Marketplace after I had purchased VOLVER. I got this set after much dleiberation. I'd already bought three of the movies on the 8 disc set and I had one on laser disc, but I still wanted the others, which are not avaialble singly. But the $90 price tag was too steep. so, I waited, and got a new set for 44 bucks on the Marketplace. It's great to have as many movies by this great director as I can."
1,Otra más,"Este hombre hace siempre la misma película, P lo hace fatal, el resto de actores siempre con el mismo papel. Los Americanos flipais con Almodovar, pero si vivierais en Spain os dariais cuenta de lo malo que es. Spanish is diferent."
1,Volver - Flies,Penelope Cruz was wonderful. We loved all the women in the movie. And her flamenco singing was stirring.

2,the worse almodovar i have ever seen!!!,"creo que es la peor peli de almodovar entre las 6 que yo vi. yo digo desgraciadamente porque quiero mucho como un brillante director a pedro. pero esta pelicula me aburre muchisimo. menos mal que yo pude aguantar hasta al final....ehhh, tambien es normal que los ""espectadores"" pseudo-authenticos que han empezado a ver a las pelis de almodovar despues de ""todo sobre mi madre"" piensan que es una peli authentica de almodovar. yo me rio.pues muy mala y aburrida. para el favor de las pelis anteriores yo di 2 estrellas. pero ""authenticamente"" daira 1 sola."
4,Nice Guns for tthe $$,Have sprayed many vehicles over the years both working at shops and in my shop at home. Was very impressed with the overall spray quality of these guns for the money. If you're wanting some guns to work with for home projects and want to keep your cost down then I'd recommend these as a buy. I used them on my teenage son's Camaro and they worked very well. I like the fact there are 3 in the set so you can keep 1 for primer and another for base and clear.
4,"Man, Lauren Hill became a man.","Naw, I'm only joking. Actually, this kat kinda reminds me of the Mighty Mos Def. I was thinking 3 1/2, but four is good. Too much singing for my taste. Don't get me wrong, singing during the chorus is tight, but I've never been a big fan of the whole a bunch of singing, one rap verse type songs. With all the hating aside, I think everyone should at least listen. He's very creative, and all of the anti bling bling messages had me smiling. It's amazing he can flow over just accoustics. And I couldn't stop playing Nuetronics, Superstarr pt Zero, and Both Heaven Only Knows versions. Actually about half the songs on here I'd play over and over. Lyrics are great, beats are good, a little too much singing for my taste, but I'd say pick it up. This kat has skills."
4,Good Stuff,the book had a little crease in the corner but overall was in good condition and my friend was very surprised and happy to receive this as a present
1,Worst seller ever!!!!!!!! Never received the item.,"This is the WORST seller ever! I kept writing the company directly, and it NEVER responded! It immediately charged my credit card, and yet, I never received the item. I ordered this item the first week of December, hoping to have it either for my daughter's December 20th birthday or by Christmas. The promised date was December 31st. It never arrived. This company should be taken off of Amazon's seller's list. DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY"
1,Mini-Mate Ionic Air Supply Model AS-150,My husband urged me to buy this product because I am very chemically sensitive. I read the reviews and bought it because everyone raved about it.I have a few things to say. What a piece of junk! This does not clean the air for chemically sensitive people. I would not recommend this item for anyone looking to really clean the air. People with MCS - don't buy it. Don't waste your money!
2,TIGHT TIMES,You might not like this book.The best part of this story is when he finds a cat in the trashcan.And he all ways wanted a dog.And I did not like the book becuse it got boring when you just read it all the time.But you might like it.But it was kind of good.
3,"Okay, I guess....","I first was introduced to this at a spa during a facial. The spa uses it and the facialist recommended it to me, so I bought it. Well, I was disappointed with the performance. After using it, I could see no difference. I guess it might be good for people with dry skin, it does nothing for texture and tone on younger skin."
4,This Oven Thermometer Works!,"I bought this gadget because my breads were getting burnt in my new electric oven. I discovered by using this thermometer that when I set my oven thermostat at 350 F, it actually settles at 375 F!I am able now able to readjust my thermostat setting and verify my desired temperature from its readings. It is a sturdy item but not made in France as I expected. It is made in China. It looks like our country is dead without help from China!!"
3,"Its a gift, havent used it yet",I am giving it as a Christmas gift to my son. he cooks a lot and has a REAL old stove at his houise at college.
5,Kellerman In Top Form,"Mr. Kellerman has written a top notch page turner in ""TWISTED"". This is not an Alex Delaware novel and it is much better than most of the recent Delaware material. The crimes and their investigations are front and center. Petra Connor reappears along with a new side kick, 21 year old wunderkind , Isaac Gomez. This was a fun entertaining, quick read."
4,Good Read,"I enjoyed this suspense novel featuring Petra Conner working with a young genius. I don't know how realistic the premise was with him figuring out things mathematically, but it was a fun read.I also liked the references to Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis. For those of us who are Kellerman fans, it's like family."
2,Is Kellerman running out of ideas?,"I read this after reading Kellerman's Conspiracy Club. They had identical ""plot twists."" Until said ""twist"", I was enjoying the book, but I wasn't riveted. I find the characters to black and white, good or bad, without any shades of grey."
1,Useless agains black / rat snakes,Used this to repel a black snake that insisted on hanging around my front door and slipping into a gap behind my front stoop. Useless. I watched the snake slither right through the stuff on several occasions. Turns out that moth balls from the dollar store works better !
1,Waste of money,"Have watched, with my own eyes, garter snakes simply slither over a fresh barrier of this without little more than a pause. It certainly is not a sure thing. Smells a bit like mothballs so it might keep them away."
1,Does not work! Waste of your hard earned money!,"We applied the Snake Away spreading it like the video suggested. The snakes just laid on top of it. We could not believe it! It was a waste of money. Can't find it on the store shelves, so we ordered on website. Maybe the stores have determined that it does not work and will not carry it anymore. Bought two different times to get the amount we thought we would need to go around the house. Now I wish there is a way to get my money returned. Please tell me how to get my money back! If you like wasting your money, this is a way to do it."
5,Truth in the title.,"These are very high quality hakamas. The seller will contact you the day of your purchase to ask you what size you need, which is based on your height (trust me, it works.) If you're interested in a quality pair of hakamas, this is the one to order. Their speed of service is excellent. I won't hesitate to order from them again!"
3,Not what I expected,"I have been using this product for the last twenty days, and there hasn't been any change in my weight, so it doesn't really work as a weight loss drug, in my opinion.However, I have appreciated the little boost of energy; it can be pretty helpful the day after a late-night study session. At first, it made me feel kind of jittery and irritable, but by the third dose it didn't bother me so much, and I still felt more awake than without them.If you are used to consuming a lot of caffeine and don't ""feel it"" much, or if you are seeking to lose a significant amount of weight without making some serious lifestyle changes, I doubt this pill will do much for you. However, if you need a little pick-me-up to get through your day, then this does the trick."
4,Wireless Presentation Remote with NO laser pointer,"I have a Kensington model #33132. It is great, except that it has NO laser pointer, so our speakers must have a separate pointer. There is another Kensington model # 33062 that DOES have a laser pointer. It looks almost identical in photos. So if you are looking for the built-in pointer, be sure to order the correct model number."
2,Conflict,This definitely does not have Laser pointer and Single button Black screen option. For some reason users have put wrong information leading us to by this product.My suggestion is pay $10 more and by one which as Laser pointer and one touch screen blanker for you to write on board if required.
4,WELL WORTH THE MONEY,"Very good product for the price, Easy to use - plug and play. It did, however, over ride the driver for the remote that came with my Dell multi projector and it took IT a long time to restore those drivers. I plan to use it only on my laptop that I will take on the road with me."
2,Product unavailable,I was unable to get the item I ordered from the seller. The seller refunded my CC promptly when they could not fill my order.
1,Game doesn't work on newer Macs,The game wouldn't work on my Mac. I took it to the Genius Bar at the Apple store & they said my Mac was too advanced for the game. The producer of this should inform buyers that it doesn't work on newer versions.
3,Just keepin' it real....,"First of all my thoughts on the album, it isn't the best album I have heard, but it is a kick ass debut album. You can tell that he is just getting his feet wet, look out for Lloyd in the near future, hes gonna blow up.Second of all, all you cats hatin', you have nothing to hate bout. This man is making millions, wat r u makin'? You're going to feel real dumb when Lloyd blows up, most of u prolly aint even hatin on Lloyd, ur prolly hatin' on Murda Inc."
1,I'M SO MAD...,"that people thought this album was worth more than zero stars!!! This boy cannot sing..I mean he can carry a note, but so can a thousand other people without record deals..Im not gonna get started on Ashanti, but that single Southside sucks ass!!! Im listening to the samples and its clear to me that he only gets recognition b/c someone thinks he's worth looking at...Its probably the young girls on here giving this album the thumbs up..Anyway, I listened to the sample of the song Im A G, and it sounds like it could be alright, only because of the background vocalists..Lloyd was singing and then all of a sudden you hear this very good voice come in and then fade out..That song just makes me wonder who the background singers are!! Anyway, I know Im not hating (although people will say that I am), Im just giving my opinion..Buy some real music now!!"
4,love product hate smell,"High quality Krill oil has replaced fish oil for me. however, the smell reminds me of whale blubber. Ick! A an odor adsorbing sachet in the bottle would improve this product. It is fully effective and no odor in vivo. Gotta get it past your nose though."
5,Excellent product,"Krill oil is another way of getting the omega 3 oil into one's system. The advantage of krill oil is that the tablet is smaller and there is no after taste that often happens with fish oil (one can taste fish oil hours after taking one or two pills.The advantages of omega 3 oil are well-known, especially benefiting the heart and brain, so I won't belabor that point. Suffice it to say that besides eating a lot of fish, one can supplement one's diet with omega 3 oil in a pill. Much cheaper than a salmon stake, and just as effective.The other advantage is that one doesn't have to worry about mercury in krill, since the krill is very low on the food chain, so it doesn't store up mercury as does other aquatic creatures."
5,Excellent quality,"Nicely produced, no rough edges on the capsules, nice deep red-brown color when you hold one up to the light. I detected zero fish-burp scent or taste. I've been a fan of blue-green algae and fish oil for some time. I'd never heard of Krill oil before.I sometimes wonder if supplements like this really work or if I just feel good about taking them. I did notice that my mood was significantly better after taking a couple of these Krill oil capsules -- can't quantify that, but I did notice it and while it was unexpected it was certainly welcome. I like these capsules and will buy them in the future.---I have noted a few times now that I feel agreeably clear-headed and centered after taking a couple of these. That may be coincidence, but I don't mind the effect one bit."
1,"Good show, poor DVD","We sent the DVD to relatives as a gift. We had seen the show before and really liked it. Unfortunately, our relatives could not get the DVD to play. We weredisappointed and are trying to get them a different copy."
3,love it,love this movie. have watched it several times since we purchased it. Love James Cagney and almost everything he does
3,Not that funny,"I was told this is one of the funniest movies of all time, I had a sinking feeling that it wasn't. But hey I gave it a shot. The movie was very well done and moved along at a rapid pace with one liners flying so fast that i probably missed most of them, considering half the time i was trying to figure out what they were referring to. Most of the jokes I could imagine my grandfather laughing at, thinking back I 'm not sure if I laughed once. I did get a kick out of Cagneys wife tho. Id say if your under 40 this movie is not going to cause you to pass out from laughter."
4,An splendid adventure into history,This book was a childhood favorite and a recent reread confirmed that none of its delights have faded in the intervening years. Certain to provoke an interest in history.
4,Rolling with laughter,"You know a movie's funny when you're watching it by yourself, and you're cracking up! Although the movie is dated and sometimes slow, it brought back childhood memories of watching other Peter Sellers movies with my family. I encouraged my oldest son to see it as he is a fan of a similar comedian Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean). Now my son for no reason will occasionally simply utter, ""birdie num nums,"" and we both start laughing."
3,It was more funny in my memory than in reality,"I remember this movie from a long time ago when I thought it was really great. So now I bought it thru Amazon. Sellers is fantastic and some of the scenes are hilaric; you can be sure that Rowan Atkinson has seen this movie a couple of times. But I also noticed that this movie is a little bit on the slow side, which is not a surprise, after all it's more than 30 years old. The Party gets out of hand in the end, and I must say that I find that end not funny at all. All in all,I am now a little bit dissappointed, my fond memory of this movie is gone. I will however definitely keep this Video as a momentum of the great 60's, the costumes, the dancing style and of course some of the best moments of the great Peter Sellers."
3,Funny except for the end.,"A very loose film based on Peter Sellers playing an Indian man wandering around a party causing havok. I love Peter Sellers, but if you don't like him or don't like his slapstick comedy steer clear. The Indian stereotypes are quite crude and could probably be considered offensive to some. I don't think that this film could be made today. I thought that this film was funny, but I can see how some people would think this is irritating (my sister is one).This film is good until about three quarters in when it just gets silly and it sort of tails off. It's unfortunate. I liked it until then. It has no real plot as such - it's basically Sellers wandering around the party. Not many other people could sustain a whole film with this, but he does."
4,This is a classic a view into those crazy 60-70's,"From a time when the studio executive could make or break a career and often held equally important gatherings in their homes. A blast from the past. The ecletic mix of archetypes, funky interiors and inuendo reminds you of a time when producers still let an audience read between the lines. So sit down with a cornish game hen and watch this movie."
1,DO NOT BUY!,DVD was defective and would not play in any of 5 different DVD players. Does not appear to be professionally manufactured. No help from publisher or Amazon on replacement. Save your money.
5,"FEMALE FOREST GUMP, BUT WHY THE SUBTITLE?","A fascinating, detailed account of Mary Pinchot Meyer ... whose connections to other famous personalities made me exclaim about halfway through the book, ""She's a female Forest Gump!"" I agree with another reviewer who suggested one also read the footnotes ... I found myself doing that almost immediately, marking the first time I recall keeping two bookmarks in a book (one for the ""regular"" pages and one for the footnote section). My only disappointment is that author Nina Burleigh in her introduction says she ""decided early on that (John F.) Kennedy warranted only a single chapter in Mary's life"" so a single chapter on Kennedy was ""sufficient."" Why, then, is the subtitle of this book ""The Life and Unsolved Murder of Presidential Mistress Mary Meyer"" and why is (easy to recognize) JFK pictured with Mary Meyer on the cover? The answer most likely relates to marketing ... the titillating subtitle no doubt helped to sell this book."
1,A criminal waste of wood pulp,"That's the only way to describe a superficial, tendentious biography of an uninteresting person of little historical importance written by an author who possesses neither insight not stylistic flair."
5,This is a Hot one,"Get everything situated, because this is a long one.But it's worth watching.I enjoyed this movie a lot."
4,Remarkable performance,"This was educational and at times difficult to watch. I guess it's not my genre, but I have to give credit where it's due. Superb acting, intriguing story line, realistic too I reckon, slightly dated, but a great production effort. Saw it and own it on DVD from Amazon, was recommended by a friend to expand my view on Hispanic culture, and that it did.A bit depressing at times, but I guess that's the price of realism? However, if you like movies about doing crime, doing time, and all the stuff that goes with it, then this is for you. It will be a long time before I watch it again I think. A small dose goes a long way. Still, I think I'm richer for having seen it."
2,"""MENACE TO SOCIETY"" IS WAY BETTER",THE ACTING IS HORRBLE.I HAVN'T SEEN A WORSE GANG RELATED MOVIE THAN THIS ONE.THE ONE GOOD THINGG THAT I LIKE IS HOW PACO CHANGES IS LIFE AROUND AND BECOMES A COP INSTEAD OF A LOSER.IT SHOWS A GOOD EXAMPLE WHY YOU SHOULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE INTO GOOD INSTEAD OF EVIL.DON'T BUY IT JUST RENT IT.
1,Bloodless and mostly out,"I only watched a part of this movie, and saw absolutely no reason to watch the rest.The actors are bad, the characters ridiculously stereotyped. But then, who knows? Maybe all White Nazis in prison are homosexual, all prison guards are rogue, and all Chicanos wear gang colours and speak English with a ridiculous Spanglish accent. Are we surprised that the Black prison gang is called ""the Black guerrilla army"" or that the White gang is an ""Aryan brotherhood""? And then there are the usual altercations in the prison dining room. Yawn. Did I mention the homosexual Nazis? And yes, there is graffiti as well. Man, I thought that was a Black thing.If you want to celebrate Mexican-Americans, do a movie about the UFW and Cesar Chavez. Or Crystal City. Or even about how Davy Crockett got blasted at the Alamo. Please forget about the street gangs and the Hollywood stereotypes.Enough said."
5,A truly engrossing film - I loved it,"I saw this film at USC in 1993 after a talk by the director, Taylor Hackford. I do not normally like films like this much, but this was a powerful and moving film which was never slow despite it being quite long.The cast were terrific and I assumed it was going to be a huge hit- I was very surprised that it wasn't. The best 'gang' film I have seen."
5,Great replacement,Great Replacement tire for the Stingray. I Needed this tire for my dad's bike. He is 70 years old! He refuses to get another bike so I searched the internet. Next I will replace his seat.
1,"Shiny, stiff, terrible hand","While it is not clear from the product description, this cardigan has sparkling metallic thread woven through it and has a stiff scratchy artificial feel. I returned it."
2,"Interesting concept, poorly written","When I saw the incredible llustration of the silver eyed child on the cover of this book, my interest was piqued. I was also ensnared by the concept of a lost tribe of African immortals having to prevent the acopalypse. Unfortunately, the premise and artwork are the best things about the book. Mr. Townes resorts to cardboard characterization and preachy dialogue in telling what could have been a great story. Instead of taking the time to craft the epic storytelling that the premise deserves, he fashions a slap dash assortment of abrupt and overwrought scenes, creating the literary equivalent of a B movie. Though the sheer cleverness of the premise does create some high points, I found this book to be the equivalent of landing a date with someone I've always had a crush on only to learn that said crush is callous and shallow.T.R.Braxton, author of Dirty Hands"
1,Didn't work twice,"Unfortunately, the second disk of the first copy I received wouldn't work in any DVD player or computer because the file had never been extracted before it was burned to the disk. I returned the first one and was promptly issued a replacement copy with the same problem. After repeaded attempts to find a computer program that could extract the file I gave up and returned the whole thing. On the plus side, Amazon.com did refund my money quickly. Still, it would have been nice to see that OT game wining goal again."
4,JFA rules,We know you suck is a great collection of true D.I.Y skate punk. I'm not to sure why Alternative Tentacles discontinued the release through. Also I recomend that you download the album on Itunes or amazon instead of paying hefty collectors prices (If it ever becomes available.).
4,Very Happy Canon User,"I read the previous reviews and agree with most everything. This is a great camera that can be easily used by a beginner but has the features wanted by experienced pros.The one thing I was disapointed in is that it did not say anywhere, until I already purchased the ""E"" model and read the manual, that the EYE CONTROL DOES NOT WORK IF YOU WEAR CONATCT LENSES. The ""E"" model was a waste of money for me due to this and that is the reason I gave this camera 4 out of the 5 stars."
3,The First Year-Hepatitis C,"Although I think this is a good book to start with if you have recently been diagnosed, I find it lacking the depth I was looking for. It gives some great resources which is why I think it is a good book to start with, but at the same time, I would also suggest that you buy the following in addition to this. These are essential:""The Hepatitis C Helpbook""by Misha Ruth Cohen OMD and Robert G.Gish MD, ""The Liver Cleansing Diet"" by Dr Sandra Cabot, ""Herbs for Hepatitis C and the Liver"" by Stephen Harrod Buhner, and see if you can find ""Who Gets Sick;How Beliefs, Moods, and Thoughts affect your health"" by Blair Justice. The treatments out there are scary and can hurt you more than help you, so if you don't feel like poisoning yourself with a biotherapy, this is where to start."
1,Didn't stick to window,This product doesn't work. It would not stick to the windows. I had to throw it out.
1,How to complain about this item,I too bought this item for my newborn daughter thinking it looked like a good idea. But it wouldnt stick or change color making it useless. I called Fisher Price and they told me it is made by the company Blue Ridge. The phone number for Blue Ridge is 1-850-835-0100 you have to leave a message for there customer support to call you back. Im still waiting on my call back. But Im returning this product no matter what.
2,It's just ok...,"I have tried 3-4 different shades...I always had large gaps from suction shades or others didn't stick well, so I purchase this one. I cut the sunshade to fit my windows exactly. There were no gaps where sunlight could get through. When I took my daughter for a drive the tint on the shades did not turn NEARLY as dark as the picture on the box and she still had to turn her head away from the window becasue it was still a little to bright. It did stick to my window though. It is a VERY good idea...it just does not work as well as I hoped. I'm still looking for a great shade."
4,"Lots of names, but rather inaccurate","As a writer of short stories I am always in need of character names which is why I bought this baby book. I find it has a huge amount of names -- from Ashley to Zara, Aaron to Zachary -- but some of the information is inaccurate and that bothers me. For instant, Elliott is not a very popular name as the author of this book would lead you to believe, and Blair is used much more often for girls than boys. So if you're looking for quantity you have it, but if you're looking for quality search elsewhere."
5,Very well built heavy duty product,This is a very well built unit. Everything fits together well and the unit is heavy built. I would definitly recommend this to a friend or family member. Customer support was great when I ordered an extra shelf. The shelf liners are a nice touch if you are storing any smaller items.
4,Well built and sturdy!,"I recently moved into a small condo that has very little kitchen storage but reasonable floor space. This shelving unit allows me to store a lot of my kitchen items and small appliances, freeing up valuable cabinet and counter space. The shelving unit also blends in nicely with my stainless steel appliances. I was able to assemble this unit by myself in under 45 minutes. Even if I eventually move into a larger space, this shelving unit will quite likely continue to provide ample storage space as it is extremely sturdy, and the addition of the heavy duty castors makes it very portable."
3,Bad Landing,"There were several small and minor broken pieces of plastic and the threaded end of one of the pipes was a little dented, making it hard to screw the other piece into it. In the end, we got it put together and I like it."
5,Have three of these...,"I now have three of these units because I was so impressed with the first one I bought (I also purchased five other units from Seville). I was able to assemble this unit myself, but two persons would make it a bit easier to slide down each shelf onto the clips that hold them in place.The shelf construction and design are very similar to a national consumer retailer's products, which cost over two or three times more for the same shelving space. However, these differences are not very significant - in terms of metal thickness and caster construction, unless you plan to store several hundred pounds on the unit and will move it around frequently. If you plan to store small bottles on the shelves you may want to consider shelf liners to keep them from tipping over through the metal slats.Overall, these shelves are a great value, and probalby far more stronger than needed for most home storage needs. Highly recommended."
2,Quite a task,"The idea of this game is cool, BUT the gameplay is not too user friendly. I'm still struggling with controls and comprehension. I may be slow or just not have the time to invest, but be prepared to spend time understanding gameplay.Personally, I only recommend this if you have too much free time and don't have any other games. This game actually inspired me to return to my Playstation for gaming."
3,Not worth $99,The video quality is very poor. Slide show was out of sync with speaker's laser pointer. I paid $9.99 for it. Don't pay top dollar for this. You will be disappointed.
3,Newbies Only,"If you've never written and want to, this is for you. It covers the basics of writing, and I mean the construction of stories as opposed to grammar. Intermediate advice like 'let characters grow organically' is discouraged in favor of rigor and commitment to finishing the story-project. Target audience is newbies, and nuances/style/voice are under-emphasized in favor of strong basics.If you've written much, or even taken Creative Writing 101 with a decent prof, you'll find this volume redundant. My rating is based on how much the book helped me, but if you haven't already read books on writing, this is an excellent introduction."
2,Item Returned: No CD,I received this book with no Tutiorial CD. Item has been returned for a refund. Company made no attempt to send me the CD.
2,Live but not so fabulous,"I was really looking forward to this CD because Roberto Carlos is one of my favorite latino artists. However; it was not what I expected, I don't feel the quality was put into this live performance, it sounded more like one big party at a football stadium! I miss the beauty, the sincerity and clearer versions that I was used to hearing on the radio."
3,Ok but blocks a lot of air,Seems to block a lot of air and wondering if this is the most effective way to prevent dust intake
2,More generic mediocrity,"The more things change, the more things stay the same: These guys started out as a cookie-cutter surf revival band, now they're a standard-issue power-pop-punky-garage outfit. Whatever. The improvement is marginal, and the bottom line is the same: No songs. Some fanzines have compared this to Cheap Trick, the Sonics, and the Stooges -- an absurd comparison by any measure. Those bands were innovative and, in the case of the Stooges, reshaped the face of music. These songs would barely make good outtakes for Cheap Trick. Power pop is supposed to be memorable, and this isn't."
4,Excellent reference,"This is a useful book for people who own an aquarium. I have solved many issues and learned so much from this book. Worth the money, and probably just as useful for professionals and for those who just love fish."
3,its ok,"i got this for school needing a instant read thermometer. well it isnt instant at all it takes longer than my old analog thermometer. another thing i didnt like about it is the size, its huge it almost dosent fit in my chef jacket. its ok for home use anything more than that i would not get it"
1,a bust,I was very disappointed in this device. It never worked for me and by the time I realized it it was too late to return it. I tried to put a new battery in it but it was impossible to do so. Even my husband tried it and couldn't. I threw it in the trash.
1,Probe is too short,The description of the probe is misleading on the website and is much shorter than what is described.It is barely more than 3 inches and is not useful for bigger size roasts.
3,"a rebuild on 2005 with 2010 programs, not a good mix?","This is a sturdy laptop. After 6 months of struggling with the quirks of having Microsoft 7 Pro Plus not fully meshed with the physical aspects of the computer's capabilities, and then having to buy a battery, which was kind of expected...Microsoft then tells me my version of their programs are not registered. The number that was on the program as the key code when I first got the laptop are not a product code, not a key, not anything that matches the requirements. So I contacted the rebuilders I ordered from...they say they will get with me...three times we make email contact, and no getting with me. Either the programs were a trial version installed just to sell the laptop, (does that explain the numbers passed off as the key code?), or the program was an upgrade from XP or something...but either way I ended up with no programs and no help from this seller to rectify the problem!"
2,On the horizon,"For those interested in such a book, but discouraged by the evaluation of this one, a new grammar of Hittite, complete with systematic grammatical description, graded exercises in transliteration, vocabulary, etc., is on the horizon. The authors are H. A. Hoffner (emeritus professor of Hittitology at Univ. of Chicago and co-founder and co-editor of the Hittite Dictionary of that university) and Craig Melchert (professor of linguistics at Univ. of N. Carolina Chapel Hill). If your need is not urgent, it should be out in another year."
3,Looks exciting/ can't wait to study all the details!,"So many details in this book, the sky's the limit as to where all the clues may be hidden. I bought this book for my kids to challenge their imagination, but it would be a challenge for any adult. This book is beautifully written and illustrated as just a story book/ face value/ even if not used as a treasure map!"
3,Secrets of the Alchemist Dar,The reason I am only giving 3 stars is that I have not read the book as it was a gift for my 8yr old grandson.The presentation of the book was excellent. Font style used will make very easy reading.On a quick look through the book I feel I would be interested in reading it.
5,Great Flash!!!,"This flash is working great for me. It has an amazing recycle time. I have been able to easily fire off multiple shots indoors in low light without missing a beat. I have also used it in a completely dark room, and all worked great. I don't like the locks on the bounce head, it is necessary to press the release on the side prior to tilting. Just a minor annoyance."
3,Using 420EX with a Canon D60,I can only get a good shot with this flash if I point it at a 10' or lower ceiling. My D60 just does not get good direct shots. I wish I had bought the 550EX.
2,ITS GETTING TO DARK. 1 MORE KILL LIKE THIS AND NJO DIES.,"I was determined to follow this NJO story line, but the ... just keeps on coming. What the editors will end up with is totally different people caring to stay with them. They will lose the fans that have supported the EU so far. But the books are trying for something that the movies were not.Maybe the editors should try watching the old movie again and try and figure out what it was that created and sustained the fandom. Your future may die with your next kill.I have to put up with the Pre-quel movies that have to be very dark. I'd rather not have to put up with it in EU-NJO."
5,"Starwars The New Jedi Order , Book 9 : Star by Star","One of the best Starwars books ever written , as well as being A perfect example of what Science Fiction should be like. This book has complex characters, strange technology ,and an intense plot. In the story we are given a believable plot that we can somewhat relate to, A battered government is forced to make a tough decision , that governments of our own world have had to make (to act in accordance to threats of a terrorist or invader ) , children come of age and claim their destiny , and we learn just what it means to be a hero. No spoilers , but the Solo's are the stars this time around, man can they fight!"
3,The Next Step,This is a very interesting step in the saga. Since this is going to be a 5 year saga you should know this book touches the very bottom of darkness and you can't wait to see what the next book is going to bring. Big characters that have been with us for years loose their lives and the New Republic gets one hell of a wake up. The one drawback I found about this book was it's length they should have made this a HB duology but then again after you read it where would you stop.
1,My 25 year experience is Ruined,"This book made me so angry I am starting a campaign to get the person fired that talked George Lucas into this. I own and have read all the books, even junior jedi.The prior books leading to SBS suck you in, then Denning is ordered to kill the most compelling character in the EU SW universe. Sept 11 gave me enough reality thank you.If you like Dark books with Sick twists you'll love SBS. I'm done with NJO until HE comes back."
2,The dreariest of an increasingly dreary series,"""Star by Star"" is the dreariest of an increasingly dreary series that shows no sign of concluding anytime soon. The Vong advance steadily and relentlessly as they have in every other novel. As in the earlier books, nothing the familiar Star Wars characters do seems to make a difference in the overall conquest of the galaxy.In addition, this book seems to have been rushed into print, as if the author had written scenes and never got a chance to go back and write the transitions that were intended to link them to each other and to the main plotline. Major characters abruptly change location and time seems to pass at different rates for different groups -- days seems to pass for the New Republic plotline while only hours pass for Jedi involved in a running gun battle that occupies a third of the novel."
1,Don't read it,Don't read it. The book wasn't bad up until the point Anakin dies. I have no intrest in even finishing the book or reading the rest of the NJO series.
3,Sad and depressing,I have three complains about this book1.Anakin dies yes i won't go with secrecy he dies i didn't like that.2.This one is a bit stupid but it would have represented a love story beetween Tenel Ka and Jacen BUT NO when Tenel Ka is about to kiss Jacen here comes VERGERE TO RUIN IT ALL!.3.Jaina fallling to the dark side i mean she is stronger than that.I recommend this book if you like all the fighting that was the only thing that kept me hanging on to the book.
3,Dark Book fits Dark Times,"Well I must say that the loss of Anakin Solo was a huge dissapointment. Many authors have spent many hours creating this carachter. Not the least to mention all of the hints that Anakin would succede as a Jedi whereas his granfather (Darth Vader) failed. Many would say Anakin did not fail as a Jedi, the argument is he himself did not fail, the Charachter itself failed. All this great writing gone to waste because what in my opinion was Troy Dennings grab for a little noteriety. Yes garbage happens but to lose faithful NJO readers is even a greater tradgedy."
3,What happened to Star Wars?,"I have read the whole NJO series and feel that this was the best written in style, but as for the plot, quite infuriates me. Loss of a major charactor and my personal favorite, was going too far. I agree with other reviews when I too wonder how George Lucas could let the authors tear this world he created apart piece by piece. The new warriors are designed and developed greatly, but if they were so undefeatable, why was it necessary to leave their own region and invade another. In each of the books so far there has only been death and destruction. No ray of hope. I too will no longer buy the books in this series. The writers have gone too far away from the real Star Wars family. Pretty soon there won't be any of the original Star Wars charactors left."
2,Tests with no answers!,"Not sure what the reviews above are referring to. Maybe the hardcover book contains ""explanations of safe driving techniques"" but this is just a study guide and an odd one at that. Lots of sample tests, but no answers provided to tell the student if they've answered them correctly!"
5,The Fall at their very best (and most unappreciated),"It may not have the immediate appeal of thieir last album, but give this one time to grow on you and you won't be disappointed. I actually think it surpasses their last effort and is quickly becoming one of my favorite Fall albums of all time. It's already becoming difficult to think of one that is more consistent in quality from beginning to end (yes, I even adore track 1). Long Live the Might Fall! And please tour Australia again soon!"
1,omg this game sucked so bad zero zero zero stars,"This game sucked so badly its not even funny, the grahpic was terrible, the gameplay was terrible, not alot of characters, this was a pieace of s..., that needed to be flushed down the toilet but good thing i rented this game from block buster but wow this was horrible not even fun the graphic was so badly meesed up it was like a crocadile at a pieace of paper and spat it back out thats how bad it was, budokai1 was better then this pieace of ho ha this was the worst game i evered played."
5,Super Awesome,"At first, I was skeptical about the new system of fighting for Super Dragonball Z, but after playing it for 5 minutes, I was hooked. I love the new variations between all of the characters, the Street Fighter type fighting really makes this a new soon-to-be classic. They really revamped the franchise with this title."
4,Haven't sharpened it yet...,"Quote from manufacturer:""Each knife undergoes specific manufacturing processes to ensure corrosion resistance, strength, edge-holding ability, and an out-of-the-box, razor-sharp cutting edge.""Mine came with DULL cutting edge, NOT RAZOR SHARP. Won't even cut skin it is so dull. -1 star"
5,As Advertised...,"I was a little skeptical on the handle, balance and make up of the knife but I must say, it's true to form. It's sharp (so far it's held it's edge), the balance is very nice, and the handle allows for a full hand grip. I was afraid it would be slippery but it isn't. The Kydex holster is a big plus."
2,Good for those with little imagination,"If you have even a little imagination, this book is not for you. For example, tip 49 says ""For a richly provocative kiss, nibble a top or bottom lip and suck delicately on upper and lower lips."" Let me ask you? Is this a secret? Do people really not know this?Between my husband and I, we found a maximum of 5 to 10 of the 242 ""tips"" useful. I was hoping to learn more than that."
1,Prima Games sucks.,"Prima Games did well on their Syphon Filter, Pokemon Game Boy, and Silent Hill strategy guides as well as their Breath of Fire III guide. However, they bombed on this one. It stinks! It has a crappy-crappy $$#@!^%$ guide for the ""B"" scenarios and lots of it are off. The walkthrough's good, but everything else sucks. $##@!&^%"
1,The original what...?,"This book although interesting by its presentation. It's base on scholar hypothesis. The named ""Q"" gospel "" or better known ""quelle"" its an hyphothetical scholar view, the document DOES NOT EXISTS, there is not evidence of the Q. Mr Robinson keep searching for the original ""good news"", but at least find the Q first."
4,"Well.. it's informative, BUT","Maybe I made the mistake of trying to read this for personal benefit. The teachings of Jesus as described in this book kind of represent a vague philosophy of love of God and love of neighbor. You have to sift through a lot of prose until the author actually talks about what Jesus taught about something. I also feel it downplays and even sorta ignores the inherent Judaism of Christ and the underlying christologies of the four Gospels.With that said..If you're looking for a more secular, less theological exposition of Jesus' sayings, it really doesn't get any better than this book. The author does a fantastic job of telling you what kind of life style Christ demanded of his followers without mixing it up with modern notions of the Gospel, or framing it in doctrine. To say it in jive: My dude takes it back old school. Back to Palestine. No preaching. No high-falutin crap. Just Jesus, straight raw."
2,All to predictable.,"Definately not one of Argento's best films unfortunately. I was very excited to get this movie today on its first day of release because I am a big Argento fan but I think he strays away from everything that made him so good in the first place. It was all to predictable. He has some really absurd characters like the coroner and the computer genius trying to catch the killer. The characters speak really bad english and the sound is terrible. You have to concetrate to listen because of this or you might miss something. And the Goblin sountrack is nothing like the one in Dawn of the Dead or Demons. All in all I think it is a bad effort. I feel he needs to get back to his roots like in his other classic movies Demons, Suspiria and Tenebre."
1,mauvaises informations,"sur le site marqué il y avait ""franvaise langue"" Ce qui est pas du tout vrai, seul un des 5 films est en francais, les autres N'ONT pas de sous-titres franais, c'est du vol, pas bon le vendeurn'achetez surtout pas chez lui"
5,the review of the watch,"The watch has a black dial and white hands. It is easy to watch the time.Don't have to change the battery.Correct to work.Opening the box when I receive the watch has nothing with protective membrance,but it looks very well.Otherwise,it also has 100meters waterproof.Thrown into the pool,it works as usual.No water leakage.This is a very great watch."
5,A True Western!,"Robert Duvall knows exactly what he's doing in these two films (Broken Trail and Open Range). Beautiful scenery that is reminiscent of the ""Old West"" is supplemented with a basic story-line that shows the intracasies of life on the ""open range"". Duvall knows how to act and authenticate his role, especially in ""westerns."" He IS a cowboy, rancher, businessman and man with a ""heart"" in his role.The surround sound is magnificent, complete with peals of thunder and the crack of lightning, blasting from separate speakers (if your system is set up correctly). The crack of the pistols and rifles and thundering hoofs of the horses is realistically passed through the audio track(s) of these movies.If you love ""westerns"", the way they SHOULD be, make these two films part of your collection. Your grandkids will love you for it!"
5,Don't miss this one!!!,Robert Duvall - his usual superb self in the role of a western character. High praise also for Thomas Haden Church.....splendid performance.
5,broken trail movie,This is a great movie that I wanted toadd tomy collection. It arrived in a timely manner and as described. No problems and no complaints.
4,Bought as a gift,"I bought this as a gift, it was a great movie and my family loved it when we watched it together."
5,Broken Trail DVD,"This is one of my very favorite movies! The DVD was packaged very well, and delivery was lightning fast. Many thanks! Would highly recommend to others!"
4,1st class,You really can't go wrong watching Robert Duvall and this is no exception. It has a good cast and is an enjoyable western. If you're a lover of the Western genre then it's a good way to kick back for a few hours and go back a century.
5,"Space Bag Stackable Vacuum-Seal Space-Saver Tote, Jumbo","I ordered a cheaper version of this item from another source, and it broke before I could even seal it. This item is great. I was able to pack volumes of bedding in it, and when the bag was sealed and the air removed, I was left with a compact tote that could be stored easily. A must-have item."
4,Better than the normal bags.,"I purchased some original space bags and loved how they sealed up things nice. Unfortunately I had a few of the bottoms rip out (just pushing big items in) and they didn't seal all that well.Enter the tote's. The totes are essentially the normal space bags, but much better. The weakest part of the bag is now attached to a canvas/cardboard section (the bottom of the tote), the valve to suck air out is much nicer, and the zipper is now doubled up. Plus the tote provides safety for it when you toss it in a closet/move with it.They lose a star because it doesn't fit perfectly into the tote, and for how much more expensive they are than the original ones. I'd like to see an original bag upgraded with the new options without the tote, kind of in the middle."
1,never recieved this package,"still have never recieved this package---am starting to wonder if i will ever get it oct 29, 2010"
3,Dvorak sounds like Mozart,"Kyung-Wha Chung plays this very straight and it lacks the bohemian flavor one would expect of a Dvorak piece. She plays it very sensitively, too sensitively, and it comes across like Mozart rather than influenced by Bohemian folk music."
5,A return of sorts...,"Red 13 is more edgy and intense than Arrival, and if you appreciate Neal Schon you will enjoy this. It's obvious that Journey has taken a direction away from the *almost* pop-type songs from Escape and Frontiers and has gone more toward the album-oriented forays of their beginnings. Almost reminds me a little bit of Rush. Very enjoyable offering, the only lack is that there isn't more of it!"
4,Good Product,"This saw is easy to start and runs well. The only thing I wish Troybilt would have done was included specs on the chain in the instruction manual for chain sharpening (file size and angle) and replacement. Also, the rpm's on the high side should be a little faster for quicker cuts, but over all, it's a good saw."
3,Still a place for the Cold War Warriors,"This fast paced novel is based around the SIS's David Jardine. A return performance, first seen in the 'Devil's Juggler'. This time he has a desk job, but must go to Beirut to meet one of his first agents. Where the Mossad tips them that two ex-agents, one from the Mossad and one from the now non-existent KGB, are running large counterfit stings that appear to be leading to the destabalization of a major world currency.Jardine is the centeral character, and he interfaces with agents of the Mossad, ex-KGB, SIS and various US angencies. He tries and track down these two criminal masterminds before they can do any real damage. He is not always ahead of these criminals. And it makes for an exciting geopolitical adventure."
5,Worked well,I successfully cleaned an annoying contaminant off my D7000 sensor with this product. It required two pads.(Please write at least 20 words describing your experience with this item. Repeated words don't count.)
3,Questionable,"Had a very messy T2i sensor that internal and auto cleaning wouldn't touch. This product seemed to help some. It isn't easy, but if one follows directions I think it would be very hard to damage the sensor. It didn't take all the spots off. I tried a ""Rocket Air Blaster"" after the cleaning which did a much more thorough job."
4,Product works and camera survived,"My D7000 sensor was extremely dirty and I was able to clean it up pretty easily with these swabs. It took 3 of them to get it acceptable... I wish they would provide you with more, but I should be good for one more cleaning. Having a good blower would have helped me, I would say."
2,missing a key element,Whole reason I bought this book was so my kid and I might go look at the locations ourselves.Although it's a fun read it's like buying a trail guide with no locations given.There should be a disclaimer on the book I would not have bought it if I would have known.
3,Five stars for readability - and one for usefulness,I can't imagine any one group of AD&D players using all those wonderful and imaginative artifacts within their own lifetimes.
5,This game is Really good,"I just recieved this game about 2 weeks ago and it is so cool. The AI is just superb its really advanced. Ive been hooked on it and i must say its not for everyone its for someone who 1. loves race cars 2. loves racing games 3. someone who wants to race cars such as the Audi TT, Mclaren F1, And lemans like prototyope Bentley its really good. the cars are cool. The tracks are real world tracks. Some of its a bot wierd but its really goos u have gotta get it."
5,Chilton wrote the book!,"My husband and I were able to fix a problem with our 2002 Rav4 at a tenth of what it would have cost at the dealer. Good illustrations. Straightforward, easy to follow instructions. If one person came up with the concept for this book, he deserves the Nobel Prize"
5,Great Positive Movie,We enjoyed this movie. What I usually look at in this type of movie is realistic portrayals and production quality. Both satisfied my criteria. I highly recommend this movie to anyone dealing with racial or financial prejudice. The music is good too but that should be expected with Michael W. Smith and friends. Definitely inspirational.
4,Good Christian Movie!,"I thought this was a good movie and a good message about big or small churches. You just have to see it. Althought I thought this was good, my favorite Christian movies still are Time Changer, Facing the Giants, and Fireproof. Those are just hard to beat. But this one is good and worth watching. Really a different message than those movies though."
1,I rate this with NO stars but AMAZON forced me to.,"Not only does Michael W. Smith ALLOW to be in a movie with blasphemy, but share a scene where the ""Pastor"" says the N word in front of him and he does nothing about it. There are many things wrong in this movie. After the first 20-25 mins. I had enough of the language, anger and attitude, that I deleted this movie and cracked it in half. I also deleted Michael W. Smith's music and threw out his music. I will Worship music that is by someone who KNOWS the Gospel who has been shown they are a sinner and deserve hell and unless they repent (daily) and put there faith in Him, they are Saved. Otherwise, there music is just as worthless as dog vomit.Call me a ""judger"" or a ""legalist"" if you want, but that's what the Bible and my heart point out to. [...]"
2,The Second Chance Movie,This was an okay movie. I expected more for a Christain music and the acting wasn't the greatest. My daughter enjoyed it more than I did.
4,The Second Chance,Entertaining movie with a very good message. Highly recommend watching this especially in these times.
5,Nice,"Installed this to my 2007 Nissan Titan SE, nice fit. Easy to install, and I also have an AEM intake in there as well, just enough room for the both of them. Love the whistle sound the spacer creates."
4,well-acted horror flick with heavy comic overtones,see this movie if you enjoy horror and humor and excellent performances by all. the plot is basic attack by aliens but the quirky characters make this a great movie.
5,They bite!,"1984,Gremlins appeard on the cinema screens.1986 the critters attacked whit heavy force,and the where a bit cooler and meaner!They can shoot poison arrows from their back,they can rool like an anti-gravity football,AND the can bite your arse so hard so you can kiss the moons! Did you think you liked Gremlins or Gholies?? No,you don,t know annything,not befoure you have seen Critters.I prommise,you wont be sorry!"
2,"Cute premise, weak acting","A good buy for sci-fi fans, not much for the others. High point for me--them bounty hunters! Especially Johnny Steele(played by Terrence Mann)--funny, evil, and that smile at the end. . ."
5,Finally a fondue pot that works,We have had a couple of others before purchasing the Le Creuset. They are OK for oil cooking but not for cheese or deserts. This one is great. The cheese did not burn or the chocolate. Easy clean up as well. Spend the money the first time on this product.
2,The only prayer this album inspires is for itself!,"Here's a collection of reinterpreted popular music that is not even fit for elevator use.This is what you get when you blend mediocre voices (these guys have such poor enunciation that if you aren't already familiar with these songs in their original form, you would be hard pressed to make out the lyrics of these songs in this album), an artificial-sounding reverb setting that attempts to mimic cathedral or monastery acoustics, and electronic music accompaniment that is off-tangent at best.I wouldn't suggest that anyone gamble hard-earned money on an album like this. Unless it's their way of starting their own purgatory on this life."
1,Doesnt work well with a splitter,"This needs a lot of water pressure to work right, I hooked up a splitter so I can get more coverage with 2 of these and it barely dribbled out. Kind of waste of money for my little experiment"
4,Nice Spot Sprinkler,This is a great little sprinkler and covers a nice size area based on how much water pressure you apply. The only problem is it's made in China and the quality of paint used is very poor. I would recommend repainting as soon as you get it otherwise it will rust quickly.
2,Disappointment,"Unfortunately, it is impossible for me to identify myself with Mr Coe's songs. The music is different,the words are unrecognisable and have nothing to do with what I have always appreciated in famous songs such as:Home on the range, Oh, my darling Clementine and, Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie. Songs that I used to hear in the 1950s and learned to love when I lived in the USA in 1960."
1,print to fine,have to use magnifying glass to read have to write info down while using magnifying glasss so you can ref to
4,Good quick-reference guide for Arizona gardeners,"We moved to Arizona two years ago, and my wife wanted a good quick reference guide to use in planting and tending our desert garden. This book fills the bill nicely, providing descriptions and clear photos of approximately 200 plants, along with tips on how to best use them in a garden. Ms. Irish's writing style is straightfoward, even a bit plodding, but readable. A good companion to ""Plants for Dry Climates"" by Duffield and Jones."
4,Sharon at her dramatic best,"This is Sharon Tate`s film... She steals every scene she`s in and she delivers a chilling precense:-) David Niven is brilliant as Philippe, as are David Hemmings, Flora Robson and Donald Pleasance. The film is uneven, but should always be watched because of it near-perfect cast.Miss Kerr would have been good 10 years earlier, but looks too old to play a mama with so young children... Her scene on the roof with Sharon however, is a classic."
2,Not what we expected!,"My wife and I have been looking for a good hot dog chili sauce and trying different brands. She picked up a couple of cans of this and we had some chili dogs. This sauce is just sort of flat tasting and bland. There is no sense of any type of chili spice in it at all. It looks like it contains finely ground beef in it but it is so bland I looked at the label and saw that there is no meat in the chili sauce.You got it, Texas chili sauce made from soy grits and other ingredients to contain absolutely no trans-fat or cholesterol or meat of any kind. It is good for your body but not for your taste buds. If you are looking for a good meat chili sauce for your chili dogs then keep on looking because this is not this one!I actually gave it two stars as we have purchased some other brands that were worse."
2,Creepy,"I'll just include a direct quote from this book, and let you draw your own conclusions about whether or not you want to read the rest of it:""Marriage was sealed by the breaking of the hymen. The bloody sheet was proof positive that they had consummated the marriage and that the bond was predicated upon the blood itself. What a bond!....The young girl shed her blood on the wedding night. The young man shed his blood in circumcision. He gave his blood to the Lord. His wife gave her blood to him, and both of them were covered."""
1,What in the hell?,"I first heard these guys when they opened for cannibal corpse a few years back. Then I heard this album after a friend picked it up and let me borrow it. In my opinion, I thought it was absolutely the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Don't get me wrong, musically, these guys are quite talented. However, the vocals are the absolute gayest thing ever recorded. There are alot of metal bands out there with some pretty gnarly lyrics, and I have no problem with it whatsoever. I do however, think its really stupid and corny to sing about nothing but serial killers. I've seen them live twice, (not by choice) and believe me, these guys literally worship serial killers! If thats your thing, go crazy I guess, but I think these guys are totally pathetic."
5,Concise and thoughtful look at abundantly living a rich life,"I am a single man and throughly enjoyed the book. Farmer makes a compelling case for living life to the full as a single person. Using scripture as his basis, he shares in a clear and humorous style ideas that sharply contrast with much of what American culture provideds as a guide to living a full life as a single person. He also takes his practiced eye and looks at the end of singleness and the beginning of marriage. How can a man and woman get to know one another in a healthy and Godly manner as they look toward the possiblity of marriage one day.I highly recommend the book."
1,Poor Rich Babies,"What a shame. Now with Bush's victory these unfortunate spoiled ""punks"" will just have to go back to being adult teenage-wannabes with nice cars, nice houses, and plenty of dough to spend on life's pleasures.What happened to punk being just anti-establishment instead of favoring a particular party? Today's so-called punks are no better than the vacuous, self-absorbed hippies of the 1960s. How sad to see that the difference between Green Day and Bruce Springsteen is virtually nothing."
4,Good Music ... Dumb Message,"I like the bands. I like the music. That doesn't mean I want to hear highschool drop-outs talk politics.Most of these bands, the older ones anyway, don't care about any of the Presidents ... they're Anarchists ... not Democrats or Republicans ... they want no government and no one with a realist view of the world could honestly think that Anarchy would work. I just wonder when Punk turned into the preppy, I-Hate-America, D-Bags that they've become. Even the old school mobsters stood up for America in WWII."
2,Mmmyea...,"""Hmmmm...I got an idea..I can use my fan base to push my political ideas down people's throats..."" I think I've taken craps that were more significant than this album. Don't get me wrong..There are some good bands on here, but the whole idea of rallying up a bunch of punk bands and pushing their politics down people's throats is complete bullsh*t. Fat Mike is dirty smelly douche bag making money off of idiots. No wonder Bush got re-elected..Nice Try A**holes"
1,god-awful,"Hmm. Let's see. A collection of crappy to ok songs and a liberal political message. excellent? I think not. First of all, yellowcard and sugarcult suck big-time, and seeing them on this cd doesn't improve my opinion of them. Great job guys, this really did a lot of good, didn't it?"
1,boring!,Boring-boring-......Did not make any sense to me whatsoeever...I thought it was going to be maybe a alphabetical list of some celebrities and maybe a short bio...but its not...very boring...
3,Not Bad - But Expected Something Better,"First, let me say that I've been a huge John Oates fan. I've always felt that his voice has been underutilized on most of the Hall & Oates albums. Some of my favorite songs of all-time are some of the early Hall & Oates songs with John on lead vocal. There's some good tunes on this album (All Good People and two or three others), but overral I think the album's songs just aren't that good. Oates' voice sounds fine (not quite what it used to be, but still good), but the songs just aren't as good as I had hoped they would be. If you're a Hall & Oates fan, I'd still recommend purchasing this cd."
3,"More ""Shui"" than ""Phunk""","""Phunk Shui"" is the title of the new solo effort by John Oates. The production reminds Hall & Oates fans of songs like ""War of Words"" and instrumentation similar to lighter Oates-penned songs such as ""Change of Season"" and even ""Southeast City Window"". In other words, a very unpretentious, pleasant album with upbeat messages throughout. The only exception, really is ""Mona Lisa's Eyes"" a bonus track on the import version.John's vocals are good throughout, the musicianship is good as well as the consistent beat--the only exception being the title track which picks up the pace.John wrote ""Little Angel"" for his son Tanner and ""Beauty"" for his wife Aimee.Best songs are ""Color of Love"" and ""Love In A Dangerous Time"".All in all, it's a good listen and better if you're a Daryl Hall & John Oates fan.Personally, I expected a more polished, energetic production but it's still a good effort."
1,"60"" pro eye hoe handle","It's only good as by itself (use as a walking trail stick), but when you integrated with the hoe; then it won't work. The handle is smaller than the eye hoe. It isn't fit properly. And they want to charge restocking fee (25%) and no shipping fee. Forget it. I'd rather burn it. I'll never buy it again!"
4,need to revise my earlier review...,"sometimes I guess one must listen a fewtimes before you can ""see it""?So it is with this CD, I like it alot and am giving it5 stars to skew the previous rating of 2 stars (that I gave it)to an average of 3.5.After listening to the CD over and over again, I sort ofcaught a rhythm (how wierd) and felt really guiltyabout the 2 stars."
1,This is good music?,"I am sorry but this is wallpaper music at a home for geriatric patients. This music does not have any depth to it and it seems to be lacking in any real ' originality' I think that just because artists might be popular on a site like Napster or if they buy their own votes, that does not mean that they can write a good record. The samples are old and the style is outdated even thought its called New Age. Sorry, but this record did nothing for me."
5,Far better than Odonata!,"Sorry, but I'd have to disagree with the previous reviewer. ""Odonata"" was a good album, no doubt, but it severly lacked originality or uniqueness. ""Aphelion"" however, is far more original and complex than ""Odonata"" and truely has its own sound, where as each song from ""Odonta"" sounded like a different artist. ""Aphelion"" is without a doubt a step up from ""Odonata"", with a better flow (every song crossfades) and a more depictable atmosphere. I think most fans will be very pleased with this album"
5,Although I'm biased ...,"toward Neal Shusterman, this was a fun, white knuckles, edge of your seat read. I read this in one day but I didn't want to because I wanted the ride to last a little longer. Can he write anything bad? Maybe...but this isn't it."
3,"""No Tilt!"" - a collection of various junior high class reviews","1. Full Tilt was way too predictable. The beginning started off weird and the ending was boring and empty. The best part of the book was the middle because it was exciting, yet still only decent.2. The book was suspenseful and thrilling throughout every chapter. The author gave us a vivid description to help us visualize the ride.3. We thought this book was very suspenseful but it got slow toward the end which was disappointing.4. We thought this book was a page-turner that kept us on the edge of our seats throughout each chapter.5. Full Tilt was a fast-paced novel that successfully created alot of suspense."
5,Amazing,An incredible book filled with action and heartache. A great read that keeps the reader engaged and supriseed always wanting more.
5,Console Gaming at the Next Level,"NFL 2K1 should get the same publicity and promotion of the much anticipated Madden 2001 for Playstation 2. Sega has created the most realistic game on the market. I have had 2K1 for about two weeks and cannot get enough of it. The graphics are unrivaled and the gameplay enhancements require you to know the game. The new, unique feature of playing other Dreamcast owners on-line is most addictive. Just when you think there is no competition in your neighborhood, Sega, through SegaNet, extends the pool of competition across the country. This feature has allowed me to connect with friends from all around the country for a friendly game on the grid iron. NFL 2K1 is a definite must buy."
4,Fast and Practical,"This is a fast read with practical, beneficial ideas primarily intended for the prose writer. Cook often refers to newspaper and magazine articles, radio pieces, and book chapters. His tone is extraordinarily chatty, almost to distraction, but his casual approach makes the advice seem designed specifically for just you and your writing. Plentiful examples from an eclectic array of pulications plus well-known and unknown writers help demonstrate the universality of the instruction he offers in this short, but utilitarian writer's manual."
4,Great!,"Fun for anyone, it's a very interesting piece for the nightmare before Christmas! And I got it in the mail quickly."
5,Superb.,"A beautiful tribute to a great American musician. Some of his best-loved arrangements, popularized by the famed Norman Luboff Choir. Folk songs, spiritual, and ballads performed lovingly by some who toured and performed with him for more than a decade."
3,not working for me,There are some interesting ideas in here for taking inner journeys. They did not engage me. I guess I am needing to be present rather escaping.
2,not impressed,"ok honestly ive only gotten through chapter one so far. and based on my interpretation of what he said is that if i want to practice shamanism i shouldnt copy tradtions but make my own. That to me is like saying pratice but dont do it in the way it was meant to be done. Peopsoanlly i think you can make it your own but first you have to understand why they did things the way they did. he sends alot of mixed messages. He also said that some people hide who they are... the only reason i can see people hiding who they are and living in fear of being ""exposed"" is that theyre not comfortable with who they are in the first place. not that they should go shout from the mountian tops or anything but hiding who you are is like saying what your doing is wrong or bad. Persoanlly i dont like to live life with fear constatnly present. Hopefully the next chapter is better...I would however reccoment the book ""the way of the shaman"" by michael harner"
4,Inwardly directed...,"Watson, with his fellow Puritans, does a great job of broadly covering the issues in terms of teh application of the Lord's Prayer in terms of the individual reading believer. He does not do so good of a job dealing with the broader issues of City of God versus the City of Man."
3,Not all that interesting...,"I was recently exposed to French Kicks for the first time and have found their other productions to be far more interesting than ""One Time Bells"". Besides having a good song followed by an OK song throughout most of the album, their sound is just relatively flat in here. Listening to it just doesn't make me feel anything that other similar bands made me feel, which is to say that only four years after its release this album hasn't really aged that well.I recommend ""Two Thousand"" and ""The Trial of the Century"" as far superior productions than this one."
3,Competent Summary,"This is a well put together book but I didn't think it was as good as Max Hastings' ""Armageddon"" which covers the same topic.It really only looks in detail at the end of the war in Western Europe and pretty much ignores the Eastern Front, which was where most of the really intense fighting took place - maybe it should have been titled ""Countdown to Victory in the West.""There are some a number of fairly basic errors which if you know anything about the subject are irritating eg he repeats the old but discredited myth often quoted by bomber crew about the Germans using ""scarecrow"" shells which looked like exploding planes to frighten them (no, they really were exploding planes); plus Hitler was 53 in 1945, not 46.So all in all, a good summary of the end of the war in the West but probably not the definitive book on the subject."
4,Very comfortable,"First of all, the manufacturer does not list a product under ""5625M"". The ""5625"" belt comes with an inner padded belt with orange threads marked S, M, and L where you can fold over the velcro to adjust the size. Then you tighten the ballistic nylon outer belt over the padded belt to secure the whole thing to your lower waste. So, I don't know why this vendor lists it as being ""medium"". Maybe it is an old model that is NOT adjustable, I do not know. Thus the 4 stars. Otherwise, the most current product would get 5."
3,"a nice, clean-cut romance","this book was enjoyable, a quick, basic read. i found some of the dialogue between jack and natalie to be bland and often found myself wishing gaeddert would have explored a conversation or incident further. and if you're looking for the physical aspect of a romance, this one does not have it. but if you're looking for a nice, refreshing account of how two people fall in love in an unorthodox fashion, this is a great experience."
2,Not terrible but you get what you pay for,The overall feel of this product is quite cheap. Although I am hopeful it will help protect the glasses from small dings I worry that if anything else happens this will turn into a glass shard carrier. I suppose this is working as designed since maybe a small ding is the best protection I should expect but the whole feeling of cheapness makes me worry even about that.
3,Out of Order...,"This book is really not too bad to help someone learn about SQL Server 7. The only criticism I have is that the chapters seem to be out of order. The first week of this 3 week book is made up of security concepts like logins and permissions. I would hope that someone learning SQL Server would first want to learn about data types and data retrieval (which comes in the 2nd week). Views, stored procedures, and triggers are in week 3.The logical order to me is: week one - data types and data retrieval, week two - views, stored procedures, and triggers and week three - login security and permissions.I think the book would be much better if the security information was saved for the last week."
4,Overall a good investment.,"If you've never used Microsoft SQL Server before, this book is a good starting point. If you are a more experienced user, this book might be a little redundant. However, it covers the new features pretty thoroughly and after going through this book I had a pretty good grasp of 7.0. If you're looking for a Transact-SQL programming book, this is a good place to start, but does not get very in-depth for more experienced users.While there are several errors in the syntax used in some of the samples, it's not as bad as some other texts I've used for other programs. (Example is page 119. Check the SQL Books On Line for the correct syntax and use the master db not the Leap db for the first two steps.)Overall, a good investment."
3,"Fast, but Sketchy","If you read this book you will learn how to get around in SQL 7.0 quickly, yes. However, a book you can read in half a day is bound to miss some information that could be very frustrating very soon. For example, there is not clear information about how different data formats interact. Pretty useful information!If you are really going to be getting into SQL 7.0, it may be worthwhile to take another day or two and read Professional SQL Server 7.0 Programming by Robert Vieira instead. It is a little more thorough without being a boat-anchor."
5,Pure 80's Love songs,"If you enjoy great Love songs, I guarantee you will love this CD. This guy can sing with meaning... RY"
5,Wonderful selections,This CD has the best of the best music of the 80's era. It is much better than I expected. It's a great buy.
5,excelent..,very good musica I enchant myself... I arrive at time. that if with the quebradita cover but anything..... he is the one of. less very recommendable...
2,The song Sailing got me,"I purchased this CD mainly for the song Sailing. However, it was my fault that I didn't read the artist for the song was Christopher Cross and not Rod Stewart; I was interested in the song by the later artist. Am personally not a big fan of the other love songs on this CD. So my 2 star review on this purchase is to serve other people in a hurry to make a purchase only by looking at the song title as I did. :-)No complaints about the delivery of the product. Just as promised!"
3,Not Bad and Not Good!,"This was a nice and sweet movie, kind of funny but with no real plot, bad script, really the story mean nothing, it ""Du déja vu!"", not the movie of the year but Drew Barrymore is good in the movie but seeing her when she is older with her son who look the same age as her feel odd, really they seem more like boyfriend and girlfriend, I think they should have put another actress to play the role of Drew as a mother when she was older, really it didn't feel real. When the father see his son (well the son he had with Drew) at first he didn't realise it was his son and when he do, well I felt it was a touching momment, it kind of felt real and also at the end when the father of Drew come and get her was also a touching moment. If you like Drew Barrymore, I guess you will like the movie. It's very cliché, this movie is so-so, not good, not bad but not Great. I saw worst but I saw better!"
3,It was just OK!,"This movie was a true story about a young girl who got pregnant at age 15, got married and had to deal with a lot of drama along the way. I really like Drew Barrymore and I think she did as great job, but the movie was just OK...nothing more."
2,Boring,"In my humble opinion, this movie is boring with few good moments. While this film does get thumbs up for exploring the fact that motherhood isn't all fun and games, however, I mostly viewed the harsher side of Beverly's mothering and hardly any loving moments with her son. I admit that this film is honest and brave, but I wasn't entertained as I found myself fixated on how many minutes are left until the end. One other thing: Why is this movie billed as a comedy when it should be a drama?"
4,An extraordinary tale,"This is a first hand personal history of a famous WW2 U-Boat commander, the only one to survive service from the early war years. Cremer provides a candid, readable record of his service, from his time as an officer on destroyers in Norway, his transfer to U-Boats summer 1940, and successful cruises followed progressively more fruitless campaigns. It concludes with a brief command of a new revolutionary XXI boat, it's loss, and his command of Großadmiral Dönitz's personal guard in May 1945.The author provides a valuable account of increasing technological inequities encountered through the years (increased certainty of detection and destruction), and later cruises without kills but replete only in narrow escapes.The edition I read (Naval Institute Press, Cloth Bound, 1985) includes a an appendix (""German U-Boat Casualties in WW2"") that lists the fate of each U-Boat in service: it's a staggering tabulation of `heroism' and/or suicidal persuasion.Highly recommended."
3,scratchy sound,"Although this CD has a lot of great songs on it I found that I am not one of those that enoys listening to that scratchy sound that the recordings of that era had. If you don't mind this, and I know there are plenty of die hards who want to experience the feeling of being brought back to those times, then you will enjoy it."
4,what a great album,"this a great album, janis gone much too soon, when you listen to these songs, you can hear janis put her soul into these songs,its nice to drink a glass of wine and listen to a great album"
5,essential janis joplin,saw her at the Dallas Rock Festival in the 60's - sat in the f ront row - watched the sweat roll down her body - she swilled booze from a bottle that was on the piano - awesome - she was just awesome
1,Beware; won't play on regular CD player,"The fine print says ""requires SACD hardware"". That means it won't play on a regular CD player."
3,For the newest retard,"A ""homme nouveaux"" has joined the 'tards (if I may use the Froggish tongue)We marvel, for he has come far -- and how far he has come!A published author! The talk of the town! We can hardly contain our glee.He alone among us can wear the crown that says, ""listen to me!""For he, no doubt, can spell just fine, and drinks only in moderation.He imbibes only fine Froggish wine, and possesses a Cantabridgian education!The contrast couldn't be more stark with our own repigrate versification.For him, this isn't merely a lark, it's his joy and his vocation.Et sic, amici mei, ""salve"" dicete hui auctori claroFamam eius sine limine crescere volo, sed litteras eius legere nolo!"
5,The cerebral and the visceral,"I felt compelled to read this book after reading a scathing review in Harper's. The review seemed so infantile and gratuitous -- and so thoroughly acerbic -- that it made me wonder why they would bother to write about the book in the first place. Having read it, I must confess that I don't always share the author's vision, particularly some of his ideas on irony, but only a cynic hardened to the point of imbecility would fail to see the value of this work -- which manages to be at once cerebral and visceral. Purdy's background is indeed unique, and surely helped shape his ideas about the American reality, but his ideas stand on their own merit -- and the courage of his candidness is admirable. While the book seems at times like a compendium of essays that don't always thread together seamlessly, Purdy's thought process is impressively astute."
5,"A lucid, perceptive analysis of ""ironic detachment""","Purdy's analysis of irony in America today hits the nail on the head. That all earnest feelings are interpreted as sales pitches or carbon copies of feelings heard on the news, seen in the movies, or read in a novel is sad but pervasive in our culture. The first chapter of the book, a look at the phenomenon of avoiding the world through ""flattening irony"", an illness encompassing and transcending both disenchantment and cynicism, is a masterpiece by itself."
1,no concrete solutions,"Purdy's book best represents the decline of the American left. Throughout Purdy's book, he never mentions any concrete solutions to America's problems. Instead we just get a diatribe against urbanity and materialism. Purdy's obsession with culture can be seen in American universities that constantly mentoned cultural differeance but never economic or insitutional solutions to America's problems."
4,Buffalo,"Hello,I liked this book and enjoyed reading it. Mr. Boddington always makes for interesting reading. If you enjoy authors who have a somewhat open mind, you will like this book.Thanks"
3,dented container,"cookies are great as usual, but containers came in leaking sugar and both were broken at the seams, which is ashame because I usually use them for decorative storage"
1,Poor Job of Printing,"Great book but a poor job of printing/scanning (""Printed in China""). My copy just arrived and all the images look washed-out, with blurry grays where there should be blacks. The copy I saw at the Tenement Museum bookstore in New York did not look like this. Very disappointing. Same for my copy of ""This Is San Francisco"" that was also part of this order. Bleh."
5,Best Cookbook,"Eating at the Ovens of Brittany was a real treat when I was in graduate school at UW-Madison. I've used this cookbook for about 20 years and it's still my favorite. The Triple Chip Cookies have become my signature recipe and I'm in trouble with my friends if I don't bring them to a gathering. The blueberry muffins are my all time favorites; hearty bread muffins, not sweet and cake-like. I just ordered my second copy of the cookbook. I wore the first one out!"
4,"Great cookbook, excellent recipes, a couple of glaring oversights.","This will be short and sweet. The recipes in this book make some great food, but I bought the book for one recipe that didn't appear: The Ovens of Brittany's famous Morning Buns. These were some of the most amazing pastries I've ever had and nothing's come close until Starbucks recently released a near copy. Still, nothing beats the freshness of having them warm on a Saturday morning on State street. A few thousand miles away, I was hoping to relive some of that glory, but was disappointed with such an obvious omission. The croissants are missing as well.Still, the book is full of fabulous tasting food. Get it if you loved the Ovens other stuff as much as I loved the pastries."
5,For All Naruto Fans,"No other way to start than at the beginning, this box set is a must have for all Naruto fans. From the beginning of Naruto's journey of becoming a Ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village to His becoming a member of team Kakashi with Sasuke and Sakura and of course Kakashi Sensei, the growth of his skills and ultimately the Battle to protect the Bridge Builder against Zabuza and Haku."
4,classic,"I adore Naruto, but hate the mash the terrible English dubbed versions on American TV have made of the characters and stories I fell for in fan subtitled versions downloaded from the internet. Although this set does not include the translations of writing (like signs) - and swears - that were features of fan subtitling it's great to hear the voices and theme music as I remember them. A very nice set."
1,"Ordered this Item, Seller Sent Plain UnPadded Leather Belt = Not As Pictured","I ordered this item from ANTOnline,thinking I was going to be receiving what is pictured. I received a plain Leather Unpadded Work Belt Instead. ANTOnline Failed to Take Responsibility for Their Mistake and Did Not Refund My Return Shipping = $8.00. However, they did not charge me the normal 15% Re-Stock Fee. Poor Return Policy and Attitude. I'll Take My Business Some Where Else !!"
3,Nostalgia,"This was a fun read for someone who remembers ads that were popular 40 years ago. (This is the 40th anniversary reissue of Mr. Della Femina's book.) I suspect, however, that younger readers will never have heard of Braniff Airways, much less its pastel colored airplanes. The same would be true for many, if not most, of the other examples described in the book. It was instructive to read Mr. Della Femina's amazement at annual salaries that wouldn't attract a mailroom clerk four decades later."
4,From those wonderful folks who gave you pearl harbor,"A witty trip down the rabbit hole of 1960's Madison Avenue advertising agencies. Jerry Della Femina's book tells about the almost unbelievable weirdness of the men in the grey flannel suits using their own words. The book is purported to be a main source of inspiration for the TV series 'Mad Men'. A hit when it was first published in 1970, and has not lost its humorous edge in the 40 plus years since - a fun read."
3,Mediocre at best,I thought the book had been updated to the 21st century but it is the same as the original edition with a modern introduction. It is a good book for those of us who were in the work force during the late 60's / early 70's but the stories in the book won't mean much to someone born in the 70's or later.
1,Save your money,"I recently purchased this album at a local record store and the sound quality of the live rehearsal tracks is terrible, and in my opinion are barely listenable. Your beter off purchasing the Brisbane Australia '79 or the Miami '80 Japanese releases, as the sound quality is much better of those performances."
1,Widescreen obsession,"I really, really wanted these toons on DVD, but cannot buy this or the other new looney tunes releases because they are cropped for widescreen.NOT EVERYONE has a widescreen TV!Not only were these originally drawn 4:3, I still have a 4:3 TV with an awesome picture that I would like to watch these on.Do not buy this shoddy, altered, edited, ridiculous homage to widescreen obsessed culture.Thank God I got the original 'Seinfeld' in 4:3 DVD, they already show the cropped WS version of it over-the-air.Preserve original art."
1,What an embezzle! What an ultramaroon!,"I will NOT buy this until WB re-issues this without the cropping and (to quote Mrs. Slocum), and I am unanimous in this!"
3,A Case Manager's Study Guide: Preparing for Certification,"Very helpful and well-organized study guide. It has ample preparation material benficial for preparing for the certification exam. Only regret is while title mentions (CD-ROM), the CD-ROM was not included in the shipment I received."
2,Not as good as picture...,"The peridot in the center is yellow color rather than green.. it really looks more like five dollar costume jewelery than something worth spending $34 on. Total rip off, don't buy it."
3,Idiots and Dummies have been bested in beginners manuals,"I was a below average player at best and I went out searching for a guide that could do much more for me than just start me off but could lead me down the path to understand the complicated chess literature. Being an avid reader and wanting to understand the game, I went through both of these books before I picked up the Best beginners guide around, ""Alpha Teach Yourself Chess (in 24 hours)"". Polgar, Truong and Horvitz put together the best introductory book you can find for the game of chess.If you've never played, or if you just started and want to learn a little more this is the best book on the market.The only questionable part of the book is the pro-Polgar twist it throws into some of the lessons, but the bright side to this is the ability to attract more female players to the game of chess."
1,Poorly Organized - Broken Up - Lacks Material,"I summed it up above. The book is written in a confusing way - it doesn't provide a step by step, building approach that is needed to introduce chess to a beginner.It jumps around from one subject to another and doesn't maintain a logical and cohesive methodology. And, it may seem thick when you first get it, but with so much paper it covers so little material directed in teaching you how to play."
5,Excellent.,"I used to play quite a bit of chess years ago, but only recreationally. I found that only chess and tennis required the kind of concentration to play well that could take my mind off the unremitting problems of running a small business, something of which politicians and bureaucrats are clueless. Also years ago I got rid of my thirty book or so chess library.Recently deciding to take the game up again, I got this book and for my purpose it serves admirably well. I especially like the inclusion of enough diagrams making the use of a board while reading it unnecessary. And I like the author's writing style: clear, concise, and focused. All in all an excellent summary and introduction to the game. Of course today the internet offers many more options for learning the game and the author has relevant suggestions.In fact, I liked the book so much I also purchased Chess Openings by the same author, James Eade."
2,Very Difficult Book,"The way this book is set up it does not teach in a good order. It has a lot of things that make no sense when you are given information suddenly that has noting to do with what was covered in the last segment and it is not instructional. Look at getting ""Learn Chess"" by Alexander as a much better book."
4,A little something for everyone,Chess for Dummies provide a little something for every chess player regardless of level of play. You can benefit if you are either a beginner or a seasoned player. Great product.
2,A Dummy of a Book,"I just wanted to say I agree with the other reviewers. The book is not organized good, jumps around too much and even though it is rather thick looking it spends too little time with actual instruction material.It is not as good as the average book in the Dummy Series."
1,Horrible Format,I got this book from my parents for my 11th birthday. It was horrible to understand and boring. It was unorganized and I feel I could now write a better this book now that I am 12!
4,Like Being John Malkovich Score?,"I just watched this movie, and I really loved it. I loved the score too. I thought it sounded like the ""Being John Malkovich"" score. So if you liked that one, then I think you'll like this one. Anyone else agree?"
4,Great Summer Cookbook,"Love this book! I ordered a second copy so I wouldn't have to carry my well worn home copy to our summer house every year. While there are a few recipes I know by heart, I always seem to find something new and fun to try."
1,Poor Quality,Give me a Wolf Garden pruner any day of the week. I asked for garden tools for my birthday and got this from my sister. I use Wolf garden tools and got these. No comparison in quality. Sorry Fiskars but your made in China quality does not hold up.
1,Product misrepresentation,"Blatant misrepresentation. I chose this pruner because I wanted a quality product that was made in the U.S.A. I do not desire to contribute to a crippling trade deficit, nor do I wish to support a country that has a business community and government as corrupt and immoral as China's. I also wish to have my money go to support jobs with decent pay and humane working conditions. Under the heading ""Product Description"" in the ""From the Manufacturer"" section it stated ""The 9109 Bypass Pruner is manufactured by Fiskars in the USA"". The product packaging states ""Made in China"". Classic bate and switch. I will never buy another product from Fiskars. I'll get of my soap box now."
2,Need to buy another pair,Grips slide off all the time. Big gap between the blade and the anvil which leaves a rough cut.
5,Personality plus,This is one of the most exciting presentations on personality that I have ever seen.The concepts and descriptions are really down to earth.
3,Great Content But...,"For whatever reason, the curser on this game makes a path behind it on the screan, and eventually you can't see what you're doing. I've never had any of their other games do this. Otherwise, it's great content, and my boys (twins - 5, and one who is 3) get a lot out of it."
5,Well Made,"Wow, this thing is a tank. I'm going to stick to the assemble since that's what most people focus on and won't be using it until next weekend due to continued rain in TN.Definitley a little work. I consider myself of ""meduim"" competence, with little patience (although as I age, it seems to becoming more prevalent). from the time I went to the garage until starting to put stuff away, about an 1 hour 45 minutes.A couple of tips that I believe helped me. I listed the 12 hardware items on an 11X17 sheet of paper (nuts, bolts, screws, cotter pins, etc.) and laid the hardware out. Definitely saved me a lot of time. I printed the directions a week before it got here and reviwed them a few times, step by step. Really pays as there are little intricacies that could be easily missed. No doubt, taking time so you don't have to repeat processes helps.Will come back and update after I get to drive this beast :)Earthway 2150 Commercial 50-Pound Walk-Behind Broadcast Spreader"
1,Why can't ANYONE create decent assembly instructions?,"Anyone not mechanically inclined should be careful before buying this spreader. The assembly instructions are garbage. Half of the parts don't match up with the instructions, the best picture of the fully assembled product is on this website, and if you really NEED the instructions you're going to be very frustrated with the lack of critical detail. I had to take the whole thing apart and re-assemble it without the instructions to get it to work properly. It spent a couple of hours in the garbage can in the meantime before I decided to start over."
1,impossible,"Not worth the price.impossible to assemble, without calling the help line,, on hold.Not sure how this got 50, 5 star'sLook for something else...."
5,Great product,I purchased this spreader after yet another less expensive spreader had cracked and split. I love the pneumatic wheels as I have an extremely steep slope to my back yard and it rolls with so much more ease than the cheaper plastic wheels. It is also far superior in the quality of the spreading mechanism and did a significantly better job when I fertilized the lawn. The only negative comment would be that even for my very handy husband this was a little confusing to put together as the directions were mostly diagrams and not well written. I know that the extra dollars were worth it as this spreader will make it far more than one or two years like the old ones .. so in the end it's actually cheaper. Fast shipping too!!!
4,Very Good Spreader BUT,This is a quality spreader but its a 2 hour process to put this thing together. Two bandaids plus some aggravation and it was done. This product would have gotten 5 stars from me if they had just partially assembled it and put it into a slightly larger box.
1,A Boring Old Man on the Road,"This was a rather bad book. Banal does not begin to describe it. The blurb on the book said that Callaghan is a classic Canadian writer, but this book does little to suggest that. Purple prose mixed with trite observations of Paris circa the tumultuous late sixties is combined with little skill at all in getting into the inner psychology of his characters. This book deserves to be out of print."
4,CoQ10 Gels helpful,"Healthy Origin gels were very effective in stopping my heart palpitations. I found when I took two gels twice a day consistently, they slowed down after 2 days and completely stopped after about 5 days. Great buy for a very reasonable price."
2,UPDATED: Quality wend down.,"Updated: May 2011Just received a new pair and feel very disappointed. What was an exceptionally slick and sensitive glove, almost latex like, turned out into ordinary rough ""garden quality"" product. The leather is much stiffer and internal seams are huge (see the uploaded picture). As the result the gloves are uncomfortable and not sensitive. Would not recommend them anymore.------------------------------Used to be: Very good for the money. Flexible too.The best gloves for the money I've ever had. Mind you they are not the heavy duty gloves, but for the most of the light work around the house or with the car - they are the perfect fit.If you want to avoid these stupid splinters and cuts, which you stare at afterwards and curse silently, get yourself a pair or two.Highly recommended!"
5,Flexible and Comfortable,"These gloves are great - they allow movement and dexterity while protecting the hands. My hands are arthritic so a non-binding glove is a great find. I wear these for everything from garden work to walking the dogs to working in the garage, and would recommend them to anyone."
5,a need,"working on anything at all, this is a must, use it to work on car and bike, brushed up against hot exhaust bike pipe and no burns, easy to wash and fit so well, dexterity not impaired"
5,real good,it got here fast. i work on car alot it dosent work when working with oil but beside that its good
3,"Eh,","Great deal but the item itself lasted about 2 weeks of rigorous use before breaking apart at the seams. Sad because Mechanix usually make a great product,but the cheaper the glove price the weaker the glove itself. Seller was awesomely quick with getting the product to me in a timely matter so that's a plus and why I gave 3 stars instead of 2"
2,spend a little more on something better,"I didn't want to spend a lot on a vacuum since I only have one rug in my apartment. However, this little vaccum doesn't pick up anything! I guess you get what you pay for since it was only 15 dollars. I think I will keep it to use on hardwood floors and invest in a better vacuum for the rug."
3,Good but not for Heavy dudty,This is a good vacume to pick up dust and some crumbs bud don't think you can clean a carpete with it. Had a little diffuclty even with a small kitch rug.
2,Was pleased at first,I read most of the reviews before purchasing and thought I'd take a chance. This worked for about 3 months with use ranging from every other day to weekly to clean cat hair mostly in a two-room apartment. Worked as advertised for the first couple months and then the motor crapped out. Didn't think it was worth it to try and repair so I just ponied up the dough for a real vacuum. Much happier with that.
1,Crap,"Total junk. Unless you are looking for a product that can take all the dust in your office, pick it off the floor, and blow it through the exhaust vent right back into the air, I suggest finding anything else - pretty sure a piece of tape would pick up dirt and dust faster. Nice color yellow though..."
2,Not so good,"Had to replace my old Eureka electric broom. I bought this one thinking it was similar. It's not. The ""sucking"" power is about 1/2 of what my other one was. It leaves dirt on my tile floor. It also does NOT have a rotating brush on the bottom. So even though it says you can use it on a carpet... forget it! It doesn't pick up much from the carpet at all. I would NOT recommend this to anyone."
2,Useless on kitchen rugs,"I should've listened to the few negative reviews for this vacuum, but the positive ones won out & I ordered this item for my kitchen. Just received it today & was disappointed in the performance of this vacuum. Basically just a dustbuster with a handle & cord!! Has no revolving brush head to clean low pile kitchen rugs of dog hair. Was okay on kitchen tile...doesn't pick up items the size of cheerios & larger. Very loud motor & plastic wheels clank loudly on tile & grout. Unfortunately, it'll be banished to my kids' playroom since it's short enough & lite enough for a child to operate. I just ordered the Hoover S220 flair bagless stick vacuum with 7.5 amp motor on Amazon....I figured that with over 500 positive reviews that it will be worth the extra $25!"
1,Crap on a stick,"I had a Eureka from about 5 years ago I purchased at a big box retailer- they no longer make that model, but it would work wonders on a small house or apartment. This was my replacement and not only does it lack brushes, it has a rubber lip that pushes all the debris away from the weak suction. It was my mistake for not searching harder for a replacement, but I just wanted to let others know if they are looking for a vacuum to perform normal vacuum tasks, this isn't it."
2,Waste of money,"This looks like one of those toy vacuums that a child would use. It is too small and light to do any type of reasonable cleaning. While using it, the machine accumulates a charge and attracts hair that sticks to the outside of it. It would be nice to use as a hand-held ""dust buster"" type, but it plugs in so is thoroughly inconvenient. This absolutely does not pick up hair.I live in a medium-sized apartment and find virtually no use for it. Save your money and choose a different product."
3,"I returned it,,,,,,,,,,","I wish I could remember the model (it was a eureka) of light weight vacuum I had prior and which I thought this would replace after it gave me a full life of usage. This was too short (with handle extended fully) to use easily for anything than a light simple spill type cleanup. I have a small apartment with cheap LOW pile carpet and though this worked ok it was clearly cheap plastic with tiny wheels that look flimsy. Suction is fair, but it doesn't have a rotating brush (I should have confirmed this before ordering) and is simply a dustbuster with a handle.I returned it easily as it was an Amazon product with free shipping so that was handles without effort, but I can't really recommend this one for anything but the simplest and easiest of cleanups."
3,Not very powerful,"Maybe this is how strong the suction in these machines is, but it was a great dissapointment compared to a full fledged vacuum cleaner. But, for what its worth, it does manage some decent cleaning"
1,Not Worth The Money,"This lightweight vacuum is not worth the money. The vacuum hardly works at all, not even able to pick up the lightest of debris on the floor. Bypass this one and don't waste your money."
4,Great Spot Cleaner,"I originally bought this for my son to play with since he loves vacuums and our large one is way too big and heavy for him. With the handle at the shortest length this Eureka vacuum the perfect size for him.I was also very pleasantly surprised to find myself keeping it handy in the living room for little messes like crumbs, bits of paper, etc. It's much easier to just plug this in and do a quick clean than to drag out our big vacuum.If you're trying to vacuum your entire home, or if you have a pet that sheds a lot, you'll need something with a little more power and a larger waste container. If you're looking for a good spot cleaner, this is your guy!"
1,You get what you pay for,"I would spend a few more bucks and get a vacuum with a decent suction. Its light weight which is grand, but the suction sucks. I wanted it mostly to clean my stairs. I had to place the adapter on and rub really hard a few times before it picked up anything. I would not recommend this product."
1,Cheap and not working as advertised,I bought this one and I was mad at myself for ignoring the lower rate comments from the previous buyers. I wanted to find a lightweight vacuum to clean my hardwood floor and area rugs. This one didn't pick up pet hairs from my area rug. I was very disappointed.
5,Softest Blanket Ever!!,My nephew loves this blanket. I buy these for all of my nieces and nephews and they've loved them for years.They seem to hold up quite well.
1,Over-rated,"This book is tripe.I bought this book when first published because of an interest in Welbeck Abbey. I normally wait for paperback editions to be issued before buying. This time I put my trust in the fact that the book had been nominated for a major book prize. Anyone thinking this is anything like good writing must be very easily pleased. For this codswallop to be nominated for a literary prize is astounding!The book is drivel.It is the worst written book I have read for 40 years (when I stopped reading ""Janet and John""). I only bothered to finish it just to see if it was as badly written all the way through. The only redeeming feature is the low page count."
4,"Great Game, and a good buy too.","When I first heard of this game, I had my doubts. Only because of the whole ""copying Mario Party"" thing, but after I played it over a few times, I realized that I liked it much better! Too many people are focusing on the negative points of the game, and not looking at all the good ones. This game is great, there are items-a-plenty and the game boards are cool and creative. The mini-games are fun to play, even if your alone. There are a total of 8 characters to choose from, 4 of them need to be unlocked. The only reason I subtracted a star from my rating for this game is because of the loading times, but really, they aren't that bad. Also, just cuz its a major rip-off of Mario Party, it doesnt mean its a bad game. Look at Crash Team Racing, that game is the biggest rip off of Mario Kart that I have ever seen, yet its MUCH better. In short, just give Sonic Shuffle a chance, and u might like. And for that price, its definitly a GOOD buy."
2,It'll take the fun right out of your party,"I'm gonna get this out of the way right now: this game is aggravating. It starts off slow and does not pick up. I first got a taste of it at my friend's party last weekend. We were both pumped to play it and couldn't wait for other guests to arrive so we could have four people playing at once. Well, the excitement wore off as soon as we started playing. The game board was right out of Mario Party and didn't look too exciting. The mini-games were dull and too short.Before too long, the other guests watching were getting bored out of their minds. And so were the people playing. But it's not like we didn't give it a chance! We persisted. We wanted to like it! Then, my friend did us all a favor: he turned off. Sadly, the rest of the guests cheered. Not the sign of a good game. I'm sticking with board games."
5,Good for obscurity.,"I thought the idea of a Sonic-themed party game was a great idea. I love the Mario party games, and this one is a good clone of such a concept, and isn't entirely unoriginal with it.I like how it utilizes the Dreamcast's built-in screen to hide cards from other players. Not the best party-game I've ever played, and the graphics don't live up to my standards for Dreamcast, but for curiosity's sake, it's fun and a good family game."
3,Best when played with friends,"This is a well polished title. I found it frustrating in single player mode, as I felt it their turns took too long or they were too lucky. I didn't like this title until I played it with friends then I had a blast, because I could at least talk to my opponents. it is not fast paced but it is fun, it loads because it is in disc format not cartridge."
1,NOT FUN AT ALL!!!,This is the worst game i have played and i own many dreamcast and pc games myself. It is very confusing and difficult to learn. I was very dissipointed with this title and encourage you straongly not to buy it.
3,great picture but,great picture and colors for a good price but has one bad pixel. Maybe this is my luck.
5,Acer 19'' FLAT SCREEN monitor,Really pleased with this monitor. I use it for word processing and it makes the type easy to read. The picture quality is great. For the price I dont think you can beat it.
2,"Not sharp, get a better one.","If you desire sharpness, then this is not the monitor for you, I ended up returning it after two days, frankly I was dissapointed but don't be ""penny wise pound foolish"" as the saying goes. Spend a bit more money and get one that will provide a more define picture!"
4,Great lcd for the money and still using it,Well its been 2 years now and I still have this monitor I like it a lot decent quality have had no problem and use it every day I got it for $279 at the time and that was the best price for like a year well worth the money. Good color not a vivid as a the CRT monitors but still rocks for an LCD a good size 19 inches for the money would make a street walker scream. I would definetely buy it again and recommend it
5,Good purchase.,"The quality is just as expected from a brand like SanDisk. The card worked without a hitch through 3 phones and counting: SE w580i, w518a, and c510."
5,Best Price ANYWHERE,i have shopped around for this and at any other store its at least about 70 bucks! this is great!
5,For cell phone,I got this so I could easily transfer pictures from my cell phone to my computer. I also found it useful for transferring ring tones and images that I find on the internet. The memory stick meets my expectations and does exactly what I bought it for.
2,i had been waited for a month,the product itself had no problembut shipping was helling slowit was almost a month!!!!!
5,Great for the price!!!,Get it!!! It's Sandisk so you can't really go wrong with the brand. Perfect for my Sony Ericsson w580i... :)
5,2 GB Memory Stick,I needed more memory to store things in my cellphone. The product came quickly and allowed me to enjoy my new cellphone quite quickly. It came in an excellent condition. I am extremely happy customer.
1,Leading Quietly,"If you have been a real leader, this book will be very disappointing. Throughout the book, the author uses fiction to create scenarios that support his point of view. The decisions his characters make are based on how little they can do and still look good. Over and over his leaders low-ball their opportunities, look for short-cuts and avoid personal risk in order to ""Lead Quietly."" If you need to read this book for class or work, be prepared to shake your head in disbelieve."
3,nice ideas but very basic,Finished the book in 6 hours - easy to read. Badaracco did a good job in pointing to the some of the obvious truth in the world - where common people bear the daily burden but get little credit for it - in corporate America also we see this day-in and day-out - people with big mouth and connections get most of the glory where as the people who do the real design for success get little or nothing -it was worth my 6 hours of plane time
1,Very dry and academic with little practical advice,Contains some interesting observation by the author but the book is very academic with very little practicable advice.
3,I did not read this because the sequel covers most of the points.(see details below),"Confessions of a Radical Industrialist. Please get that one instead of its older but more well known predecessor. The first chapter of the sequel says that it repeats and updates most of the points of the older book, Mid-Course Correction."
5,Excellent quality,"My dad bought this camera for family use about a year ago. I have used it several times and the pictures were of very high quality. Even though my friends took the same pictures on their cameras, the pictures I took with my camera turned out much better than theirs; they were much clearer. This camera is easy to use and the high quality compensates for its size (a little bigger than most other cameras). There is a new model supposedly smaller so you may want to check that out."
1,Buyer beware of Syracuse Language products,"This review deals not so much with this CD-ROM as with its producer, Syracuse Language. I have two Syracuse Language CD-ROMs, for French and Italian, purchased a couple of years ago. I rated them as fair, until we upgraded to Windows XP. We were not surprised when the CDs no longer worked, but we were surprised at Syracuse's attitude when we called them about upgrades. We were told that they were no longer making language CD-ROMS (a statement that this listing on amazon would tend to belie) and that no upgrades or any other assistance were available to us. No apologies for the inconvenience, no thanks for our past business. I am not the most technical, computer savvy person around but, to me, this is like buying a book and then having the ink disappear after two years.In short, I would caution against investing in Syracuse Language products (which also go by ""Knowledge Adventure"" and ""Sierra"") as the support for products is not there."
4,trans-atlantic adventures,"Erlend Oye (the other half of Kings of Convenience) knows his way around the block, this particular block being our own wide world. He can also discern the good from the great as he builds 10 tracks based on the best attributes of 1980's electro-pop presented here in his new album UNREST. Conjuring able assistance from like musical peers, Erlend travels to ten different cities over 12 months to custom craft 10 delightful tracks that are so simplistic that they should attract broad appeal without alienating critics nor fans. Morgan Geist, Prefuse 73, Bjorn Torske, Schneider TM, and Mr. Velcro Fastener lend credibility and creativity to the kind of songs that get stuck in your subconscious with pleasant results. From safety to everywhere, UNREST is a double plus good with a bullet to the present. Genius is nothing more than being clever at the right moment. Subtle and provocative, these moments come in abundance from all over our planet."
1,"Not the original artists, and conveniently not mentioned.","I had my suspicion when I saw the price and it was only confirmed when I received the album, unfortunately it was NOT stated who the artists WERE on the page. I was also fooled by the remarkable forgery of ""Nobody does it better"", (really the only song I TRUELY wanted from this album, everything else was just gravy.) But if they had had ""Live and Let Die"" listed as a sample it would have been painfully obvious... I'd appreciate in the future if albums like these were labeled a little better... I skipped another album like this that was actually LABLED with the artists... Wish I could have skipped THIS one and not had to pay $5 of total shipping for something that I now don't own..."
1,Bond could use these CD's as skeet practice.,"Expecting a wonderful rendition of the great themes from the James Bond movies but by different artists, I instead ended up with woefully imitated (at times VERY imitated), badly sung rip-offs. Not all of the songs like Diamonds are Forever even have the singing! Some songs like Man With The Golden Gun and On Her Majestie's Secret Service don't even sound like their original incarnations! A bad or unpopular song like Golden Gun could have benefitted greatly from a redo! I got rid of this CD ""collection"" like a live grenade (I will not even comment on the atroctious rendition of Nobody Does it Better.) Stick with the original The Best Of Bond... James Bond 007 for supiorior music by the original artists. You need these CD's like you need Blofeld feeding you to some piranna's. It's awful."
4,"Made in Taiwan, but quality seems good","This knife has a good weight and feels good in the hand.The main complaint is the ""Made in Taiwan"" edged onto the side of the blade in big letters."
1,Garbage,I bought two of these from Lowes. On one the rubber seal on the hose bib connection failed after a couple months. On the other water leaked from the left dial control.
2,Would not recommend,"Looks great, but not very practical. This stand is somewhat laborious and difficult to use. In order to raise or lower the stand, you have to unscrew and rescrew a knob. It's not too difficult at first, but it begins to get harder and harder to tighten within a couple months of use. So much so, that I've decided to order a new stand from a different company. Don't waste your money."
5,Good Movie.,"This was a good movie and it is definately worth watching it. Even though some of the other reviews say that the ranks and stuff were wrong, who cares. The movie has a lot of action and it is a good movie to watch if you are a van damme fan.thankenjoy the movie"
2,Very Disappointed,"please do not buy this item because sounds very bad, poor sound quality, no even good for a kid this not worth it, pay few more money and buy Sony or Panasonic not that one, if you want a buy it anyway do not waste your money its a crap no good boombox at all."
1,What the hell is going on here?,This DVD is horrible. They go so fast you can't keep up. The steps are all so complicated that you must have to do it like 20 times before you figure it out. Also if you don't own this special step device it's useless. You can't use this video with a regular step at all. It's out of date and the woman hosting it is mega annoying oh and every woman in it is skinny and blonde. Like clones. Fetish much?
1,Avoid...,No helpful information. Much of the quackery characterizations are literally decades old. Justifies the phrase 'the greatest fanaticism is always seen in those who are challenged by changes to the status quo.'A hate book if I ever read one..
2,Most of these singers need to get with the program.,"This CD is Koo because you get all of the collection for 25 dolllars. BUT, out of all 4 CD's excluding the Euro Invasion(forget about those euro invasion cd'd) there are enough songs to probably make 1 good cd. I'll break it down: A lot of songs don't belong on this CD, and they ain't from Canada and make the CD look good. Goods songs are Disc One: tracks 1,2,17,19,20. Disc Two: 2,8(P.S #7 the ughy hughy dughy song is hella gay. Disc Three: 2,4,7,9,10,15, Disc Four: 1,2,3,4,10,11,12,13,15(Best CD). all other songs either were used and has nothing to do with freestyle heaven or are straight up bogussssssss!"
4,MORALE BOOSTER,"THIS ABOVE ALL is Fox's reply to M.G.M's MRS MINIVER..a wartime morale booster,showing the usual american idea of the middle/upper class stoicisim that Britains were enduring in wartime conditions, which are not quite the real reality,Joan Fontaines off the cuff description of what England means to her, isnothing short of hilarious but in the general intent of the movie is wellmeantIgnore the totally american ideas of what an english home should look likeanother similarity to MRS MINIVERIt's still agreat movie and well worth adding to a collection,especially if you enjoy MRS MINIVER"
2,weak,"i give this album two stars - one for the amazing ""knuckle down"" (though the demo version is better - more raw and moving), and one for the amazing ""lag time."" every other song is boring and not worth listening to. the album ""dilate"" has more good songs than this."
5,Angry Folk Music :),"This was a gift for my brother-in-law, who is a fan and describes Ani's genre as ""angry folk music""...kind of like Alanis Morrisett angry. haha"
2,I miss old Ani....,"I LOVE Ani's older stuff. I've continued to buy her CD's but they are getting more hit or miss, instead of sure-stedies. Unfortunately, this one never grew on me."
4,Raging Waters collide with Hot Rocks!,"the result? this Steamy album! this so caled ""popchaser"" envigorated me so much, i had to listen to it again. i thought i liked listening to the ocean, but now i know i was missing some action. admittedly, i did pass this one up for a lobster stuffed with steak, but its one of the best albums i own. its like chunky style peanutbutter, the best of its kind of music you can buy. so hop to it, and start riding the wave."
4,Great Game,"This is one of my favorite Dreamcats sports games. It has one of the better AIs of all the Visual Concepts games. NFL2K1 is impossible on All-Pro. WSB2K1 is cumbersome abd too involved to play. NBA2K1 is very real and fun and the computer doesn't cheat as much as in the other 2K1 series games. The play announcers are kinda buggy because they say some things at times that don't make sense. but if you can ignore that and some screen clipping at points, you'll love this game."
4,Marginal Improvement over 2k...But still a long way to go,"A good game with added features. However, this game is still far from the real thing."
2,The Diabetes Improvement Program,"It wasn't what I was looking for. Having diabetes since 2004, I was looking for new information. Not in this book. I was very disappointed."
4,In the Valley of Elah,"Tommy Lee Jones gives a very powerful performance. In the Valley of Elah is the Iraq War's version of the Vietnam War's The Deer Hunter. Also, the movie highlights the cover up and bureaucratic issues afflicting the U.S. Army. Seems that the more things change, the more they seem to remain the same. Recommend viewing this movie, but not while the viewer is in a depressed mood."
2,Iraq War as cheap plot device for motive = not good,"This movie really goes nowhere and uses Iraq induced PTSD as a cheap (as in no class) plot device to explain inhuman behavior. I'm not buying the screenplay or the insensitivity. The acting is 1st rate, but I have no idea why Jones or Theron would appear in this. The war and its effects is fair game for inspection... it just needs a truer more meaningfull vehicle. 2 stars is for the acting, otherwise just 1.NOTE: It's always interesting to see reviews, and voting on reviews such as mine. I find it amazing that the 'motive' for this crime is considered plausible and that having a group chicken dinner afterwards ""because we were hungry"" fits in with a 5 star screenplay."
4,!Tha best AZ rapper period!,"AZ Mike Mill is the siccest rhymer in the AZ. He went to Trevor Brown High School and lived in Maryvale. I grew up in peoria and I personally thought Mike Mill was the tightest rhymer in Arizona. The best track is the title track ""What Up Doe"" and all of them are really good and its worth the ten bucks you'll pay. Mike Mill is currently serving a 9 year sentence for 3 drug charges. Go to bigfeve.com to get information on how to contact him in prison. And pick up a copy of What Up Doe to see the best rapper holdin it down for Arizona! peace"
2,Seeder,"Not happy with this. It was really not what I was looking for. Having bought it, I will have to keep it and put it in my yard sale. However, it arrived well packaged and in 2 days after my order was placed. That's was I call GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE so 5 STARS for the seller. Just not happy with my choice of seeder."
4,good machine would suggest a try.,"Got the job done. I planted 6, 25 ft. rows of corn and had a good stand. 1 problem, depth of seed planted was sporatic. some were too near the top of ground and some were almost too deep. The ground was very soft. But planter had to have a steady control of planter it kept wanting to ride out of the ground. Once you experienced that and adjusted it worked well."
4,Richard,the product is simple to use the plates have the type of seed to use them for written on the plate itself great planter
2,Butternut disc,"i was so excited to buy the machine. i even paid more to get it delivers sooner. when i get home, trying to test the butternut seed, the seed was not fitting with any on the disc. it spoilt all my excitement.can someone tell me which seeder am suppose to try to win. i dont feel like buying more discs until someone tell me if there is disc for this.is it possible that the discs are US sizes. i tried fitting all but i failed.later"
5,Precision garden seeder rates high with me.,I really like the way this product works. It is made well with most all parts being rust free which is great when you do gardening.I had one just like this for many years and needed to buy a replacement. I went looking for this one again since I was familiar withthe guality and use. I would highly recommend it for those home gardeners.
3,Really didn't work for me,"I think this works best if your garden dirt is very fine, friable, and you've run a compacting roller over it. In any kind of cloddy or uneven soil, the seed depth varies enormously.I also had trouble getting an even distribution for some seed sizes but maybe my seeds were odd-sized. I didn't try experimenting with different sized plates - just used the plates labeled for the seeds I had."
4,think this may be good!,this is a strange c.d reminds me of some of the old hardcore bands.every song seems to have about 3 seperate parts to it.highly recommended if you dont mind a bit of noise{screaching vocals shrieking guitars etc}will need to be listened to more than once before making your mind up
1,How in the world did the cd gets 3 1/2 stars,This band is just awful.They opened for APC and there set didn't end soon enough.I have no idea how they were able to be the opening act.It was just awful.Save your money and APC new cd instead.
1,Do Not Buy This!!!!,I too bought this steam cleaner. It worked great the first two times. Today I went to use it and no luck. The water/shampoo isn't coming out. And of course the Bissell.com site is down and their customer service isn't open on Sundays. HELLO isn't the weekend when people clean their homes?
5,The best fiction story ever written,"A very intriguing story that once you start reading, you just can't stop. Also recommend the soundtrack."
3,rare when a book isn't as good as the movie,"Usually, one reads the book then goes to the theater or turns on the television and is disappointed. However, while the movie lacks the complexity of this book, it at least gives us even to care about some of the characters a little bit. Perhaps it is the science aspect that is bringing me down -- I'm just not buying the premise of the book. Perhaps it is the view of humans' need for religion -- but I'm not buying the idea that the fake can replace the real for most people. All in all, I was disappointed."
5,Read all Dick's writing as a body of work,"Philip K. Dick's work has to be taken as a body. All of it encompasses what I call his ""ironic paranoia."" ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" fits right into this.The problems with Dick's films are two. They are either (1) too philosophical or (2) action films. Or they are both. What they have not been is ironical. And without irony, you haven't got Dick.""Minority Report,"" ""Blade Runner,"" and even ""Screamers"" were enjoyable films. But they all lacked Dick's wit. Only ""Total Recall"" came close, with its unexpected twists feeding on paranoia, though the overall result was more burlesque than satire.Stick with ""Androids"" and the other novels and short stories, especially the earlier ones (through 1965). Taken as a body of work, they are monumental."
4,father of modernscience fiction,"as the title indicates, I consider Phillip K Dick one of the fathers of modern science fiction along with Robert Heinlein. This is the only book of his that I have read, but I am well versed in science fiction and cyber punk. The book is strong, the writing style is typically sci-fi, fairly straight-forward with periods of techno-babble which later make sense. THe plot is interesting and thought-provoking, and when Kurt Vonnegutt wrote about sci-fi authors in Breakfast of Champions, I think he must have been thinking of PKD. This is science fiction as well as philosophy, and I recommend this book. If you like it, I also recommend you read Neil Stephenson (Snow Crash, oh yeah), Orson Scott Card (Ender's Game), Robert Heinlein (The Moon is a Harsh Mistress), and whoever it was that wrote Neuromancer, I forget his name. All of their books rule but the ones I mentioned were my favorites."
2,Blade Runner It Is Not.,"I have to admit, I only picked this book up because I loved Blade Runner so much. Since this is the novel that it was based on I thought I would be in for a treat.What I found was a slow moving story, similar to the movie. Rick Deckard's life is explained a little more, and so are the other characters which is nice. I liked the character development. But the story was just so slow moving I found myself drowsing off once in a while."
2,Guess What?,This book sucks. A fan of Blade Runner I is. A fan of this book I ain't. The plot dev is clunky. Character dev is next to non-existant. Silly twists and weak ending. I haven't read another other Dick novels but if this represents what he was up to... he was up to no good. Yes I do like SF...Pass on this.
5,"Phillip K. and Ridley S. ask ""what is human?""","Not only did Phillip K. Dick produce an amazing work which is more philosophical and intellegently reflective than 99% of other sci-fi, he touches on the BIG question - ""What is human?""But the real triumph is director Ridley Scott's movie based on the book.How many times has a movie been better than the book on which it's based?Twice? Maybe..."
3,Does Not Replicate The Film,"Androids is as different from the film Blade Runner as most of Ian Fleming's Bond stories are from the films made after them. Deckard comes across as a more henpecked, harried man--married to an emotionally distant woman, seeking the answers to life through a simulation of the last days of a sort of messiah whose end came about similarly to Jesus'. You'll meet most of the same characters, but don't pick up this book expecting to experience the same oily, slinky, gritty feel of the noirish movie. It stands on its own as a good story, if not a little confusing at points as many of Dick's works are. True BR fans with knowledge of earlier drafts of the screenplay will have a better time making the connections between book and film, but those who've seen the movie once or twice only and thought it was ""okay"" or ""pretty cool..."" may find Androids a bit tedious and discouraging. A must for any die-hard P.K.Dick or Blade Runner fans."
2,Those poor andys,"2.5 really. Definitely not my favorite. I can appreciate PKD's vision of what the future could be, but I didn't like the character of Rick Deckard at all. I couldn't feel anything for him except dislike. There were also quite a few times in the book where I had to stop, scratch my head, and then re-read the passage, and it still didn't quite make sense to me. (Or as I like to call them, my ""Huh?"" moments.) I can see how this influenced cyberpunk and later sci-fi authors, and I appreciate this novel for that, but it just didn't work for me. I read this quite a while after I had seen the movie, and I liked them both about the same. The book and the movie are significantly different from each other, and Deckard follows different paths to achieve the same goal of ""retiring"" (killing) the androids. I thought that paths were interesting, just not interesting enough."
3,Makes you appreciate our world,"This is my first Philip Dick Novel, and I must say while I enjoyed it, I somehow expected more. It certainly makes you appreciate our present biodiversity, but while you expect it to be suspenseful and exciting, it fails to deliver and is at times anti-climatic. Nonetheless, it was interesting. I'm looking forward to reading his other works."
3,A biting if too short satire,"While I don't think I enjoyed it quite as much as the nightmarish world of 'man in the high castle' Androids is still an effective if somewhat truncated-feeling book, the sense of menace that Dick develops in the former just isn't as compelling or fullfilled here. Yet Androids is also a much funnier, more scathing book. Dick's questioning of the nature of reality can come across as cheap and dull at times, but what's always exciting is seeing how the characters in his books react to that problem, (whether they use drugs or machine induced collective hallucinations to do so). It feels sort of like someone taking the new agey, self affirming BS of the 1970's and forcing it at last to eat itself to show the rotten selfishness underneath it."
2,Not up to Expectations,"The first 1/3 of this book was very intresting to me and really kept me in it, as the foundations of the story were laid. It slowed down though when Deckard met up with his first android target. The next 2/3 of the book had interesting ponderings and the quest for the answers by Deckard,but the action in the book was a big let down.Most action parts were covered in one confusing sentence that left me with a, ""What happened?"". The action in the book also seemed to be spaced a bit strangely also. Overall, an okay book, but somewhat of a let down."
5,Memories,"This is just a simple classic that I enjoyed reading when I was young. I introduced this book to my children when they were young. They enjoyed the story and have asked me to make sure that they have copies to read to their children, someday. It's cute and familiar to all children."
1,Gerber saw,"I bought this to saw down yucca sticks. It broke quickly and didn't hold up at all, breaking after less than 10 cuts. It has stopped me from purchasing another from Gerber. I guess the saying, ""you get what you pay for,"" plays out here. It was cheap and performed poorly. I did waste my money."
3,"OK, But Not Great","The Leica C1 is a good looking camera that fits well in the hand. But when compared to other, less expensive point and shoot cameras, there is really nothing to justify the extra cost.The automatic exposure works well with print film but is not accurate enough to handle slides. The lens is sharp, but certainly not better than other mid-range P&S cameras.There is no diopter adjustment, no manual overrides other than flash and a fixed +2EV setting. The ""step"" zoom takes some getting used to but turns out to be faster to use than a standard zoom. The camera is not weather resistent, the manual makes it clear that this is strictly a ""dry always"" camera.In summary, the C1 looks nice, works well, but offers nothing new or improved over other, cheaper, point-and-shoot models."
1,This book is completely useless.,"Jesus saves.... problems remain. Anyone with half a brain for strategy games and half an hour of playing Rebellion under their belt could have written this book. I've read and used Prima books before, and this was VERY disappointing by comparison. The stat charts in the appendices are decent, but these can be found for free online. Nowhere was there anything explaining HOW these stats work. Don't waste your money on obvious advice like, ""Make sure you keep your Facilities busy."""
1,Will the galaxy be yours? Not with this.,"Zack's Rating: 39%This worthless strategy guide won't help you: I guarantee it. Weak strategies means Honeywell's copy of Star Wars Rebellion must of had a few bugs, because these don't work! Get tips on this game somewhere else."
4,Perry Mason Season 5 Vol 1,"Being an avid fan of Perry M, I enjoyed watching him at work on this series....the product arrived on schedule as promised an in excellent condition. If I had anything negative to say about this purchase it would be that as the series goes on we get less an less on each disc an fewer an fewer discs in each package! Other than that I would recommend this to other fans as long as they don't have to pay extreme prices for it."
3,Complaining isn't going to change the price,"Okay, people, I agree, these sets are way too expensive. But you either pay the price or do without. Paramount obviously isn't going to change their pricing structure. If sales drop they will simply stop putting out the sets. So live with it. Complaining isn't accomplishing anything."
4,Inexpensive and easy to use,I installed a couple of these last summer and found them much easier and safer to use than brass fittings. Brass fittings usually have a sharp hose clamp on them to slit my fingers. I don't know how well this plastic will hold up when exposed to harsh sunlight for a couple of years.
3,my son is probably too young,"I heard great things about this game, but at 2.5, my son is too young to enjoy it. We'll take it out again in a few months."
1,Disappointed: collapses with no music,"The bottom section stays in place, and the base locks in position, but the top section doesn't stay up and slides down even with nothing on it. This makes the entire top section rather useless. I don't know if this one is defective, but I would not buy this again."
4,Hamilton 59 inch music stand,"I picked one of these up at my local Goodwill for $7.99 in perfect condition. I've never had a music stand and have always wanted one. I bought it thinking it would be at least $20 in a music store but it's only about $10 so it wasn't a great dead for a second-hand item. The stand hold sheets and books just fine. It has a couple metal pieces on the side you can move that keep your page. Even if you don't play music this works great for keeping books up if you get tired of looking down so it's a double score! Since it is adjustable it can become very tall, I only need it at the lowest setting for bedroom practicing. Definitely worth the money and you can always pass it onto someone else down the road. Glad to have come across this product. I also got a mint with tags Buddy Guy signed polka dot Jodi Head guitar strap for $3.99 the same day/same place!"
1,Not very convincing,"I read Shamdasani's book together with the two books by Richard Noll. When you compare the books, it is clear that Noll's scholarship is thorough, devestating to Jung, and convincing. Shamdasani's book, which at 144 pages is actually more of a pamphlet, is a strange, mean-spirited, attack on Noll that borders on the personal. It is an odd book that seems to have been written in a jealous rage. Obviously Noll is the more talented scholar, and Shamdasani wastes his arguments on trying to undermine Noll without offering anything new and convincing. It is not surprising that this book has not been reviewed by serious publications, as Noll's have. Thank goodness I did not buy this book, but read it in one long sitting in the cafe at Borders. Shamdasani's book is a waste of time and money. Don't buy it."
5,Everything I thought it would be,"I saw the first Vs. video a long time ago and it blew me away. I picked this up expected to be captivated, and I was. I love the greatest hits bonus section for Rodney and Daewon that covers the first two videos. Their new sections are amazing, and the skating from the Almost team mixes the large tricks into the technical stuff."
4,It's all about Rodney and Daewon,"My favorite part of this video was Rodney Mullen's and Daewon Song's part. Chris Haslem has a really good part to but he's a little sloppy with his tricks. Ryan Sheckler had a huge backside flip and a gigantic ollie off of two diffrent roofs, but otherwise his part wasn't to great. Greg Lutzka did a lot of smooth skating in his part but never really whipped out any awesome tricks.Basicly, it's all about Rodney and Daewon. This video was okay, but its not the best."
4,This is a great album,This is going to be a short review because I'm tired.The music on this album is incredible. It is really a shame that so many bands on this CD didn't make it big because the talent is really there.
3,Control is great - severe leaking where hose is attached is not!,"I own 4 or 5 of these sprinklers to help me keep an acre watered. They get a lot of use, and I have to move them around a lot. The control with this sprinkler is awesome - I can water just about any shape patch. But the sprinklers leak something awful where the hoses attach. Its not a threaded spot, so I can't just use washers or thread tape to fix it. Its where the plastic ring to screw the hose in attaches to the sled base.Positioning the hose to not waste water is hard due to the leaking. And I get wet every time I move them. I wish I could figure out a way to patch this one faulty spot, because otherwise they are the best sprinklers I've ever owned by far."
4,Voit Playground Balls,I purchased these playground balls for our school's recess periods...Money raised by our PTO was used to buy supplies....The price was great and they arrived in a timely manner...But we have only been using them for 3 weeks or so and already one of the balls is flat..We have inflated it several times but it has a leak somewhere...I think that it is the valve...I hope that none of the other balls goes flat since we were relying on Voit being a company that makes products that are meant to be kicked and thrown around..Hence the name kickballs..Thank you
1,2 of the 3 were missing parts,"I ordered 3 of the sprayers and 2 of them came without some of the parts. I contacted the seller to see if I can just get the parts shipped to me, and I received a generated email about sending the sprayers back. All I wanted was the parts that were missing, not to send the sprayers back. The sprayers aren't worth anything without the cap or the wand!"
1,manufactured to be defective,"I have rarely bought a product so defective by design as this one - which I deliberately selected to get a metal (instead of plastic) spray rood. On no fewer than three locations, the ""want"" wobbles and when not stay screwed in or fastened for more then 20-30 seconds, and, even when fastened, leaks at any given time on at least one of the three locations. It's not just the lousy quality control of this junk, it's that any company would actually believe it can sell something this bad. It's planned obscelence - from right out of the box. I don't understand the other positive reviews. It doesn't look to me as as if I just got a sprayer that was, by way of exception, defective, but rather that the entire design/manufacturing is seriously faulty - across the board."
3,"Good, but not great.","I like this tool because it is truely pocket sized and has good sissors. It is great for attaching to your keychain. It is rather blocky though, you can get most of the same stuff in an Swiss Army tool with a much sleeker profile."
5,Stupid Christmas Gift,"My former employer gave me one of these for xmas and I thought it was just about the stupidest thing ever... until I had surgery on my wrist, and my cast pointlessly covered the end of my thumb leading to considerable discomfert. To my suprise, the scissors on this tool cut the fiberglass cast with relative ease. A very good quality tool."
4,Red Micra,"Great tool, Bad paint job!! Buy this in silver(or just carry the painted one in your pocket for two weeks and it will be silver)!"
5,Written by a woman scientist,"This is an unusual and sometimes annoying book written by a zoologist who says she has 24 years of owning cats. Okay, but is that science?She doesn't say how old she was when she decided to experiment by feeding a kitten whiskey and milk, to see what would happen. It never grew, developed a strange expression, and died early. WHERE WERE HER PARENTS?? IS THIS A GOOD START FOR A SCIENTIST?Interesting first chapter called NO. All the myths of cats that are not true. Lots of anecdotes and photos make this a keeper for vets and cat lovers. Out of print and collectible."
5,A Lovely Film,"I saw this movie on the big screen at its original release and found it charming, but I must admit it was not my favorite Bette Davis performance, so much had come before it showing Davis at her exceptional best. Now, these many years later, I have a greater appreciation for her portrayal here and I find that I am quite pleasantly surprised at her work. There is a subtle revelation of who Apple Annie really is that is quite beautiful to see. Her performance is so reserved that she seems to give the picture away to her co-stars, but what is actually happening is a remarkably intelligent development of character that only adds to Davis' range as an actor. She is, in a word, superb. All the actors are wonderfully cast in this truly delightful gem of a Capra film. For Davis, an excellent cast and the overall high production standards of this movie - 5 stars."
1,Burned not once... but TWICE,"I ordered and received this hose and it arrived with one end of the hose being severely ""bent"". It definitely would have restricted water flow.So, I returned the hose and reordered it soon after, thinking the defective first hose was simply a fluke. The second hose arrived in same manner - bent about 4 inches below the coupling. I need to look elsewhere..."
1,Mine came with a hole,Hooked it up to the faucet to wash my wife's car and got sprayed in the face from the middle of the hose.
4,"A hose that lasts, great for a larger lot....","I recently bought the 100 foot 3/4"" hose from Amazon based upon my previous experience with a 50 foot 5/8"" Gilmour Flexogen hose I've had for half a dozen years. I've gotten lazy in recent years and leave my hoses outside even in our -20F (or worse) upstate NY winters. (I don't use the hoses in sub-freezing weather, but I don't bring them in, either). Of the three different brands of supposedly ""premium"" hoses I own, only the Gilmour Flexogen has held up unaffected by this use and abuse.When I looked for a longer hose that could sevice the far reaches of my gardens, I did not hesitate to go for the 3/4"" Flexogen since I knew that the supple flexibilty and non-kinking qualities of the shorter Flexogen would be even more important qualities in a longer, higher capacity hose. Oh, by-the-way, the price a Amazon was the best I could find, too."
5,Fifties and Sixties lived again,This music takes me back to my own high school and college dances to big band music in the 1950s. Great music.
4,Wonderful!,"Let's Fondue! is a cookbook for everyone, even if you don't enjoy cooking. And I don't! It's so easy and so much fun. And if you're entertaining, you and your guests can have a great meal and you can still enjoy yourself.What makes Let's Fondue! so good is that Lukens provides the reader with tips, techniques and guidelines that will ensure a successful fondue experience. It's amazing the simple things you can do to make your cheese, beef, chicken, vegetable, broth and desserts even better. And there are great salad, sauces and dip recipes that are delectable.I love the Mexican cheese fondue. The Korean Bulgoki is a family favorite! And the vegetable salsa is to die for.... But the white chocolate fondue, maple rum chocolate delight and mocha fudge fondue is something you won't want to miss.Armchair Interviews says: If you love good, simple entertaining with scrumptious food, try Let's Fondue!"
5,Great fountain pen,"I have this pen with a medium nib and I love it. I was surprised the first time I used it when I inserted the cartridge that the ink flowed immediately. I didn't have to wait at all or scribble on the paper to get the ink to flow from the nib. Smooth, medium wet flow. No skipping. A real joy to write with. I know that there are people that don't like the pen clip placement at the nib end but I do like how it aligns my fingers when I'm writing with the pen. It is fun to watch people's faces when you click the pen and out pops the fountain pen nib rather than the expected ballpoint."
2,"Pretty dated stuff, pass on this one","Overall I had hoped for better, the writing isn't all that interesting and in some cases rather amateurish and obviously its very dated. You wouldn't think it would make all that much difference, but it does. Overall I would not suggest this book, I'm glad I didn't spend much on it. You're much better off buying new and separate bio books for whoever you're interested in."
3,Not all that well done,"The plot was there, but the novel was never really fully developed. The characters were set up as stereotypes and thus not too convinceing and completely predictable. I like something more thought provoking. Definitely not as good as I was expecting."
5,"exciting, heartbreaking, thrilling",This book was about how a girls life was turned upside down when her sister went to college and became anarexic. Now along with dealing with her parents she has to deal with school problems and love life trama's. I gave this book 5 stars because it kept me into it the hole time and the main character deals with real life problems that teenagers go through every day.
2,Disappointing all around...,"While a good read for high schoolers (girls having to deal with body image and family dynamics would do well by this book) this novel will be a real dissappointment for those beyond this age. The narrative is simplistic, the characters one dimentional, and the story is too plot oriented without resolving the plot it circles around. I kept waiting for this book to get better. A good book to buy for your daughters, but not yourselves."
1,Don't buy this cheap chair,"Take it from a college student that was trying to save some money, this is not worth it.After waiting weeks to receive the chair I couldn't even sit in it because the wheels would fly across the room when any pressure was applied. The wheels don't snap or screw in, they simply stick in a hole. This makes it almost impossible to get all 5 wheels in without the others falling out as soon as it is lifted off the ground. Then after 20 minutes of stategically putting in all wheels they fly all over the room once you sit in it. I returned this quick fast and in a hurry; save yourself the trouble"
5,GALLLLLLLLLLEEEEEDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!,"The Bellmaker is Mainly about a Fox who wears a wolf's skin, and he tries to take over Southsward, but there's a girl named Mariel (Mariel of Redwall sold seperately) and she two main companions, Dandin (another mouse) and Bowly Pintips (a Hedgehog). Mariel and the others gather an army of Otters, Hedghogs, and Moles. Meanwhile, Mariels Father Joseph the Bellmaker has a dream that he will save Mariel with others. The others are Log-a-log the shrew and his band of Guoism, Foremole, Rufe Brush, Durry Quill (Fat wettysnout pricklybottom cakeface), Rosie Woodsorrel, and Finnbar Galedeep. Together they fight a gruesome battle. In the end, The Foxwolf gets killed by Finnbar, but Finnbarr gets killed by a rat named Bladetail. This is a very exciting book with an awesome, explosive, annhialating band of characters."
3,not unmarked and 'new' as stated in the description,"Although it was said to be 'new' and purchased as a gift, the book had a line of black marker across the edge of the bottom pages of the book. I was disappointed, because for less money, I could have purchased a 'used' book."
5,The Bellmaker,"The Bellmaker is a great book. It tells about the father of Mariel of Redwall,Joseph the Bellmaker. This book is for the Bellmaker for the dream was his"
5,This book sure isn't fundamentalist!,"Yet again one of my fellow political liberals (I am a zealous supporter of the Democratic Party) confuses Evangelicalism and fundamentalism. Are thos of us who vote Democrat communists because the Democrats and the Communists are on the political left? Never! I have read this book and I certainly don't feel that this author is in any way fundamentalist. (He is a self-professed Evangelical, but in Britain half the Evangelicals vote Labour or Liberal Democrat). See what you think of this book for yourself . Why not give it to your fundamentalist friends? His chapter on the way in which Americans guzzle most of the world's energy resources is hardly what I call fundamentalist! Sure he wants Muslims to become Christians. But so do Muslims seek to evangelise Christians! Let's dump our prejudices and cliches and see what's REALLY going on!"
1,sounds of nature & the great outdoors,Do not like at all!!!!! Poor investment!!!wood never buy again. not very good to rest too...wanted ocean sound only but could not find.
3,Works but take a very LONG time to dry after use,"These bandanas do cool you down. I use them for my kids so they can cool down after playing sports. You wet the bandanas, store them in the fridge overnight, and then keep them in a cooler if you want them to stay that cold. I suppose you would still get it to cool if you just refreshed it under cool water after they warm up. After you use and rinse them, it will take DAYS to dry them out. I hang them outside in the sun, stick them in the dryer and it will still take three days or more."
3,evercool bandanas,The product starts out cold like it stated but it does not last long only about 5 minutes and when you are outdoors and have no way of rewetting them or putting them in the refrigrater it is just not worth it.
1,The colors ran.,"They did keep us cool, but the colors ran on to the neck of the shirts. Which is weird as we gotten the patriotic ones also and they did not run."
2,Disappointed,"A friend gave me a similar item she had purchased at a fair. It was wonderful!The beads inside were plentiful, stayed plump and cool several hours. After soaking item, able to wear it right away without clothing getting wet. Material was soft cotton, that layed quite nicely when tied. Thinking these were the same, I ordered 2 sets. Not nearly the quality that my friend had puchased. Not enough beads inside, cloth was stiff. Unable to wear after wetting material, it soaked my clothing."
4,Bandannas,Excellent product. Did everything it said it would (namely keep one cool when in the sun)Product arrived promptly and safely.()namely
5,Mountain Soul is a perfect title.,"I really love this CD, especially ""Sorrowful Angels,"" ""You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive,"" and ""Sounds of Loneliness."" This is a refreshing change from pop music, which has taken a turn I do not like. In Patty Loveless I find the real authenticity of feeling of the old time mountain music, as well as blues, and the folk-rock music of the sixties. I hope she starts a new trend in country music."
5,What a voice,"One of the best whole albums I have ever bought! One great song after another, truly a great soulful voice."
1,Yet another cash-in,"In the last 2 or 3 years, there has been a revival in so-called bluegrass music. The ""Oh brother"" film spurred on this revival even more and now every pop singer under the sun is cashing in.Patty Loveless is a country act with HEAVY pop leanings. She is commercially turning to stuff that influenced her long ago to make loads of money.If you like awful music, I can't recommend this sacharine CD enough! If you want to listen to real country and bluegrass music, stick with Moon Mullican, Bill Monroe, Jim Reeves and Jerry Lee Lewis and so on."
5,Patty takes it HOME with this album,"This album is somewhat a brach out, but ONLY in a good way. Parry goes back to her roots with an album that will keep her listeners coming back for more, and more, and MORE. Another great album from Patty."
2,Not great,"The instructor is competent, but she talks so slowly - it makes the video boring. It was difficult to stay motivated. Also, when she does moves on the roller, the camera should zoom in on her legs and the movements so it would be clearer. Hoping to find a better video than this."
3,not enough content,"This is a pretty good video, Well done but lack upper body and arm rolls. I found some more informative videos on youtube so a combination of the 2 will suffice."
2,Flexogen hose balloons,"Two months of use on this ... Flexogen hose and it developed balloons in two places. One place sprang a leak. Had to replace. Rather than risk this again, unpgraded to ... commercial grade,( which intererestingly carries no warranty at all.)"
1,Terrible,"Absolutly the worse hose that I have ever had. i bought it because it was 1/2"" and I wanted a lighter weight hose to unroll from a hand reel daily for watering plants. The hose swelled up with multiple bulges and leaks within the first week. I threw it away within two weeks. i did not return the product because I did not want a replacement. It was poorlt constructed."
3,Flexagon 1/2 Inch x100 Feet Hose,I was a little disappointed with this hose. The water flow was just above trickling!! Poor water flow. Not as expected!!
5,A Valentine's Day Treat,"I don't think it was a coincidence that this compilation was released right in time for Valentine's Day. Most of the songs were composed by Justin Hayward, which suits me just fine. He has a way with a ballad that is very unique and romantic. The Moody Blues are due to have a new CD released in the next year. I, too, can hardly wait for some new songs, but this is a nice collection to hold me until then."
3,Didnt exactly rock this city,"The first thing thats a dead cert with this cat is nice, intelligent rhymes with a truely sick delivery. But unfortunately another dead cert is production that is really inferior to his ability. I got the original pressing of this, (not the 2.0 version) so there's a slight difference in the track listing. But all in all i have every track on this version anyway bar ""mr.baller"" and ""soldier's story"" (which seems to be the good 1 that slipped away). There's 14 tracks on mine and 7 are gems while the remainding 7 are highly forgetable. The stand out tracks are ""rock city"", ""get paper""(neptunes), ""we live"", ""you cant touch me"", ""boom"", ""life"", and ""my friend"". Add the 2 short 1 verse tracks ""its tuesday"" and ""d-elite pt.1"" and you have a good solid album. Well worth a listen."
3,Its plastic,It is a good speed square although its is plastic. I wanted metal speed square. It is very durable and strong.
2,"Worth a listen, but nothing new here.","I've been a huge NIN fan for years and gone out and bought all trent's releases ... except this album. Why, because Trent deserves lower sales on this. Half the songs sound like The Fragile: disc 3, which isn't a bad thing - but the rest is unashamedly commercial, an attempt to do something MTV / radio friendly. Dave Grohl's drumming doesn't lend well to NIN. There's nothing on this album that smacks of experimentation or creativity like previous NIN work and it's obvious at this point in Trents career that he will never find a new lyrical slant. There are good tracks here - Every Day Is Exactly the Same, Right Where It Belongs, amongst others. Personally I aint buying until Trent puts something original out again - and if I have to wait another five years I'll have given up on him."
2,Not Thrilled,"Cables were too thick and did not connect tightly to components or speakers. At times, would come loose from speaker binding posts.Save yourself some grief. Buy decent speaker cable and connectors and put them together yourself.Would not recommend this product."
5,"Clear, precise, detailed","Listening to David Humes talk about Photoshop allows me to think the topic and all the details of Photoshop are in fact easy to accomplish. He explains each of the concepts thoroughly and then elaborates in detail so that even the fine points are clear and manageable by me, and I am not one who ""gets all the technology stuff"" easily. Now David has written it down in the same clear precise oral style but with the visual detail added to make the concepts and fine points even clearer. If you need help with Photoshop then this is the place to get it.Ralph E. Hillman, Ph.D."
1,Bad girls is bad,"I read this a while ago. I was disgusted with how bad it was. Basically, it's about two girls who punch people in the nose and think it's cool. Please, I would hate to see you waste your money on this junk. Read something worth your time and money. This is definetly the worst book"
1,Introduction To Bluetooth: A Total Ripoff,I was totally disappointed and feel scammed. This isn't a book. It's a pamphlet. It's an excerpt from another book and I blew through it in 10 minutes. What a waste of money. I was really looking forward to this book after reading the review but it's totally misleading.
5,Students must have,"If your a student of tcm this book is a must, it is thorough, clear explanation of how the elements present in psyche of man."
4,Easy Solution,I bought this plug as an easy solution to the problem of how to connect my DishNetwork receiver to the internet. This was literaly as easy as plug and play. I plugged one of the plugs into my wireless router and into an electric outlet and then plugged another plug into the outlet near the receiver and this works great from providing internet service for two of my Dish receivers. I got the 85 Mbps plug based on other reviews stating that the faster plugs will not work with a Dish Network receiver.
1,Nerve deadening,"Unreadable. This endless poem is so stuck in the ""old time religion"" that it is totally irrelvant to modern readers."
1,Disappointed,When the box was opened it did not contain the mirrors (kit 22)! There were two electricity (kit 23)! The kit was not what I expected for the money that I spent! Disappointed!
5,Refreshing and Powerful!,"INFINITE ABILITIES is a necessary and empowering reminder of where we need to look first for help! In today's world, we are encouraged to go in search of answers and remedies which are all proclaimed to be ""out there"". This book stands as somewhat of a warning against the belief that the difficult decisions and obstacles we face may only be effectively dealt with by relying on some external, universal panacea. Through a touching story of friendship, Ivy delivers a powerful message of inner strength, and actually teaches us HOW to access and trust our OWN instincts and abilities."
1,It leaks BAD around the hose connection,"It leaks BAD around the hose connection. I have even added a second hose washer, but it still leaks bad. This is a manufacturing defect."
3,Good Hose But...,not nearly as flexible as I was lead to believe from the advertising. Even now after being warmed by the sun the thing still want to coil up like a spring. In addition the portion of the hose that attaches to the hose bib leaks unless some serious muscle is placed behind tightening it. I will not be buying this product line again.
3,new action,I was glad to see some new guys that can really do martial arts doing an action film. It had a good story and great fight scenes. The girls in the film are hot!!! good film to see.
3,no happy face,"the packaging was as usual but on the first play, it began freezing at the same place. I viewed it on my computer media player, 4 month old computer which I clean and maintain every week."
5,He is soooo good looking!,"Dermot is so good looking in this movie. This is one of the first movies that Debra Messing has played in and she is hilarious! She is great in ""Will and Grace"" but really shines on the big screen. If you need a movie with a great plot, hot actors, and a onscreen romance, then this movie is for you!"
2,Dermot Mulroney...need I say more?,"Debra Messing is good and fun to watch in this cute, light, and not-too-terribly-long romantic comedy, and her pairing with Dermot Mulroney worked for me! I'd rent it or borrow it from the library though (sorry, Amazon!). Not worth buying, but a cute enough flick."
3,Okay,"It was an okay movie. I like the story line and the actors, but it wasn't as great as I thought it might had been. I didn't see it in the movies, but I like Debra Messing, so I got it."
3,The Glass is Half-FULL!,"ok, so this movie was cute, and Debra and Dermot have great chemistry...and they're fun together...the story however is kind of rushed, I wish they would of had more scenes together so we could have really see them fall in love. I don't mind if a movie is predictable as long as it's a complete story...this one left me wanting more, but in a good way...not because the ending was unsatisfactory but because something inbetween was left out. In saying that, this movie is worth a watch for any romantic-comedy fan. Besides, Dermont is well....Dermont! The supporting cast is funny too, and there is an interesting twist that keeps the story involving. Man, is it just me or is there a lack of romantic-comedies this year? This movie doesn't fill the void but it helps."
3,"If you Hate Amy Adams, this is NOT the movie for you","Can Amy Adams get MORE annoying?Her character is supporting, but she plays the obsessive brat SO well, you wonder if she is like this in real life.Typical girlie flick - girl loses guy, girl hires male prostitute to pose as her date at her sisters wedding - I mean doesn't this happen to you ALL THE TIME???And of course her male escort turns out to be Dermot Mulroney (during probably his hotter years). I mean I cant count on my fingers and extra toes how many times I have had to hire a male escort to play my wedding date and it turns out to be Dermot...I mean c'mon Dermot...Can you stalk someone else.Anyway - if you are doing a facial, and eating alot of chocolate with a cheap box of wine, this is the flick for you. ENJOY!!"
4,Fun fun movie,"Even though I had seen this movie before, my girlfriend had not. We laughed and had a good time with this movie. Especially with the references to Air Supply. I think it's a funny romantic comedy that didn't take itself to sereously."
3,A nice flick,"This is a nice chick flick. The only hint at nudity was hidden by great camera angles. I liked the concept but I never felt Dermont Mulroney was really that great as a romantic lead. He was supposed to be this guru of women and what they want, but just came across as tired and never quite over his jetlag. I've gone back to it a few times and will eventually watch it again but I don't always reach for it first."
2,Read the Book!,"This movie is based on one of my favorite chick lit books- ""Asking For Trouble"" by Elizabeth Young. Then they murdered it. While the book keeps the plot outlandish but somewhat forgivable, the movie makes the whole concept so ridiculous that you just shake your head. The wedding is only a fraction of the book (over and done with by page 168) with a lot more going on afterwards. In the movie there's not a lot going on at all. The ending seems thought up at the last minute and you forget the whole thing 15 minutes after its over.Being an avid Dermot Mulroney fan, I was excited to see him return to mainstream films. But when I saw the movie I was greatly disappointed."
2,Debra Messing's great performance was not enough!,"Will & Grace's Debra Messing is one beautiful woman. She's able to hold her own as a lead actress. But unfortunately, her great performance this movie was not enough to save this clunker. I though the script was weak and was in need of a re-write. The supporting cast was also weak and I didn't care for them. This should have been done over with better lines or laughs. By playing it straight, this movie flounders. It also didn't help that NBC Universal promoted this movie as a laugh riot comedy. It was a disappointment."
5,Hilarious!!,"Before I went to see the film, I read many reviews online about how bad the film was, and now that I've seen it myself, I have to say that I totally dissagree. I couldn't stop laughing the whole way through the film and had to cringe at Kat's attempts at making her ex-fiance jealous. This film was one of the funniest I've seen in a long time and I'm positive that I'll be buying the dvd when it comes out."
4,Not quite My Best Friend's Wedding,"It you haven't seen the movie, treat yourself to it. And why wait; tonight is as good as any to stop the day to day chaos and enjoy a bit of British romantic comedy. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney are compatible on screen; however there is very little chemistry between them. This movie is a predictable cross between My Best Friend's Wedding and the Run Away Bride (both staring Julia Roberts), as is most of this genre, but still enjoyable to watch. If you set your expectation dial to ""relax and enjoy"", you will get just that for the next 90 minutes and not be disappointed with The Wedding Date.For those who enjoy a great musical soundtrack, it is hard to find a soundtrack as well done as this by Blake Neely and the Northwest Sinfonia Orchestra with Michael Bublé. Bublé's voice is so smooth and has a wonderful way of building a sense of romance adding to a delightful movie."
3,"Entertaining, delightful...(with a few flaws)","Fun chic-flic, entertaining and funny, gorgeous scenery and terrific sound track. Obvious bad editing job, some scenes left you wondering because of chopping. A couple of the deleted scenes should have been left in. Mulroney's character was very cool and in control but should have shown more emotion. All told, I recommend it, but I wish some of the scenes had been a little longer to develop the relationship between the two main characters, and between Kat's character and her sister's. It could have been a lot better than it is."
2,Neither Romantic nor Comedy,"The movie had potential: good cast and interesting plot. Its the kind of movie you want to like, but just can't. I did not find it all that funny or romanic. It seemed that the mother and a bride's maid were suppose to be funny characters but I found neither very amusing. I have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other; this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie. Their relationship is not developed well at all. As another reviewer noticed, there is a bit of Pretty Woman here, as Dermot plays a male escort. For whatever reason, Julia Roberts as a hooker is cute, whereas Dermot is not. I found is pretty disgusting that Messing falls for a male prostitute. There is a lot of crude sexual humor that I didn't care for. My favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the English countryside, which is really beautiful. Its not a terrible movie, but I would be upset if I paid $10 to see it in the theater."
5,Superp,"Yes, it is an excellemt one . buT gotta learn and experiience how to use it for better result eg. yr hand must be quite steady when shoot. But the result is more than I can say! If money is no object , should get one."
2,Okay nothing special!,I found it okay but at times a bit boring. There was adventure e.t.c but the chracters didnt seem to develop into anything.I think this one by stephen frey is a big NO NO!
2,"Lots of promise, but no delivery","I just discovered Stephen Frey recently and really enjoy his books. This one, however, was a big disappointment. I read a few reviews and found I should have paid attention because they were right on the money. This book has a great beginning that really drew me in, but as it went on, the writing went downhill and the end really seemed to be slapped together. What could have been a fabulous final third of this book, had it been developed, just kind of fell apart. He must have been in a hurry to meet a dealine or something - totally unpolished.I highly recommend The Day Trader, and The Legacy, but would not recommend The Vulture Fund at all."
2,"Silly plot, 1-dimensional characters","The plotline, while preposterous, was at least entertaining and fast-moving. Unfortunately character development doesn't seem to be the author's strong suit - suitable for those looking for something one step beyond a comic book (heroic, ex-quarterback young investment banking stud saves the world). OK beach reading, that's about it."
3,Just OK,"My 6-yr-old daughter received this game as a gift and we found it to be fairly disappointing. It keeps jamming up, the graphics aren't great, and it's annoying that Barbie has to change her outfit whenever she wants to switch between ""stealth"" mode, for example, and ""action"" mode. My daughter hardly ever plays this game and prefers Barbie Explorer for its faster and more exciting pace."
2,Frustrating and dull,"The game starts out challengingly enough, where you learn the basic moves for Barbie. Then the game starts and it's a snooze. Tokyo in particular was frustrating -- imagine a city with no one living in it (post apocolyptic?) and no instructions for how to get around. You find yourself running down abandoned alleyways forever while an annoying Barbie voice says, ""Look, there's a light on the second floor."" Take it from me, there is no light on any second floor. In addition, any time Barbie has to do any running and jumping she must change into a winning little outfit to do so, which seems ludicrous but then again, it is a Barbie World."
2,Watch out for this one XP users!,"My daughter received this game for Christmas. It worked fine for about a week...in fact we actually completed the game. Then the game started messing up when we tried to play it again. I kept getting a ""runtime error"" everytime we tried to play the game. We uninstalled the game and tried to reinstall and couldn't get it to even install the second time. Other people I know have had the same problem. Too bad, because it was a fun game when it worked. If you don't have XP I would recommend it."
2,I am woman,"Horrible rendition of ""I am Woman"". It's NOT the one you heard on the radio. I have the LP and played it to death, but what ever possessed her to change it on the ""Best of Helen Ready"". It sounds like some night club adlib or karaoke version of woman's national anthem. Annoying."
2,Water seeps into the plastic bottle,"I don't know if I just got a defective product but after some spraying, the weed killer that is in the plastic bottle was being diluted with water and when weed killer is 40 dollars a bottle it really is a big deal to have a lot go to waste on top of the weeds not getting the full effect of the product. It sprayed really well I just don't know how effective the weed killer will be. :( Sad I was really excited to have an easier time controlling weeds"
1,Probably defective,"I had one of these before and I was satisfied with it for the most part, until it broke. But when I attached the new one I bought to my hose and turned the hose on, it was stuck spraying, even though the handle was not depressed. I had to run back to the spigot before all my solution was gone. No instructions gave any clue as to why this could be happening or how to correct it. I don't have time to deal with this."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought I could use this with miracle grow powder, but following the mix rates for the Gilmour(1 tbs/5 ounces water, set at 10 per instructions)), the jar runs out in less than 2 minutes.I thought this could replace the miracle grow dispenser that has poor reviews, but at least that dispenser feeds for 15 minutes filling the container once.The nozzle is also not good at all for soaking individual pots, it sprays out over a wide area, more for foliage spray than soaking the roots.Please let me know what I'm missing....filling that tiny container every few minutes is crazy."
4,Works very nicely,"This works as it is supposed to and is easy to use. It just is not very big so if you need to spray a lot of your yard or whatever, this won't work for you."
3,"Cinema Noir, but without soul and malice...","A comparison with the original Bogart is inevitable, and, excuse me but, for me, the Bogart film is much much better. In first place, the Mitchun version seems to me a censored version in original idea, like the producer or director prefered a version without malice ( not for case, if my memory don't fail, the father role was given to James Stewart) and soul, diferent than the Bogart version. For example, a original Bogart dialogue with the sale book lady, with rain, with drink, is classic, is marvelous. Don't understand me wrong, i like this Mitchun version, like the Mitchun's voice and the beauty of Charllote Rampling, but for me, Robert Mitchun is much better playered, in a similar role, in The Yakuza, for example. So, i expect this dvd quality be good, and probably will buy myself, but this Bogart version, that i already have, is much better..."
5,Offbeat spellbinder,"This book held me in thrall page after page. The story is truly unconventional and offers the satisfaction of conventional, topnotch plot construction added to highly unusual events."
2,More a history of conflict,"I was hoping to have an experience of the heroine's inner life as she journeyed through New England, England and India. What I got instead was detailed pictures of men fighting men....in all locales. I was putting up with it until I got near the final section and when she described the elephants crushing the heads of the warring men, I quit. That was enough for me. I never got a good sense of Hannah, just the outer events in her life and how she responded meekly and subserviently. While this may be true to the time, it did not inform me about how she was with it and how she translated that into her art. I cannot recommended this bood,"
2,Not That Great,"I read this book when I was writing a report on the causes of 9/11, and it had some good stuff in there, but some of it was pretty crappy. There's better resources."
5,Excelente!,Simply the best concert I've seen from Ruben Blades... Definitely worth it!Simplemente el mejor concierto que he visto de Ruben Blades... Definitivamente vale la pena!
5,Dinosaurs,This is an excellent book and has lots of interesting overlays to make it more interesting.
3,Super Reader,"I suppose this is a fun romp, it gets freakier and more entertaining towards the end. A down on his luck spacer type, ends up in trouble and on the run, and gets involved with three girls. They turn out to be aliens with super powered psionic abilities, and because of these they, and their whole planet, is reviled by most others. Hijinks ensue, he comes around to their side, etc."
5,I coouldn't stop reading,"At the time I first read this book, I also was planning an escape to the south pacific and beyond. I loved the book's humor and blended family fun. Most of the other ocean-going logbook stories told of the author's heroism and the dangers of the high sea. Herb and Nancy's book makes an ocean voyage in a small boat seem an attainable and fun goal.I also like the ""buy a boat and drop out"" attiude of the era in which the Payson's started their adventure. It's a blast from the past."
2,Hmm...,"I was really looking forward to getting home and reading this book when I bought it but felt a little let down. It didn't grip me at all. The story of Princess Alice is so lovely but the writing was rather stilted and not at all what I expected. It seemed to be more of a series of facts than an in-depth look at what was going on in Alice's life. Events came and went without a sense of continuity. Having said that, there were occasional interesting anecdotes but there were few and far between. Having been so looking forward to reading it, I felt little cheated.Most Beautiful Princess"
4,"How to Read a Book Without Getting ""Weekley""","David Weekley's ""How to Buy a Home Without Getting Hammered"" is a book among books. With a classic cover illustration and a mastermind behind the insight, this New York Times Bestseller brings tears to my eyes. When I think about buying homes, I think WEEKLEY. David Weekley. He's the 007 of buying homes, and now -- writing great books.Anyone who doesn't buy this book is just an idiot. And Patrick Byers, you truly are ""with"" King Weekley. Great book guys!"
4,Covers What You Need to Know,"This is a great how-to book on the buying a home process. It reads well and has a conversational tone most how-to books lack. Credibility is important with tools like these and having been written by David Weekley, well-known homebuilder, it's a given."
5,Barbie Team Gymnastics,"This game rocks! I'm in gymnastics, and I just love it. You start off in the lounge, where you choose the girl(s) you want to practice with, and you can choose one, two, or all three. Next you go to the roster and choose the gymnast and apparatus you want to work on. You can also look at each gymnast's notebook, which illustrates all the moves they know. You can choose the moves you want, then put together a routine. Once you have finished, you get either a red check, which means you have to practice again, or a green check, which means you have done your routine well. When you are done, you can go to compitition! After each compitition if you win you get new leotards and cooler, harder moves to put in your routines. (Hint: if you find that you have finished all the compititions and there are still blank spots in your notebook, then go to barbie.com/gymnastics, and you can download new moves to fill your notebook with!)"
4,Gymnastics is cool!,This game that my mom bought me was the best because i wanted a game i could related since i`m in gymnastics and this is it! and because i like barbie alot! it had cool rountines you can create and you can pick out the outfits and you can get more if you win competions this is a fun game!
4,good but sometimes unrealistic,"I am on the Level 5 gymnastics team at American Gymnastics, and I love thins game. Unfortunatly, even the creators should know that gymnastics isn't that easy! We have to do sit-ups, pull-ups, hollow body holds etc. barbie and friends don't do any of that and yet they're as good as olympians! And, the judges arent that easy-going, they make you really happy if you even get a 9.0"
2,Roots Rock Reggae in Germany last tour 1980,Lovely show .........but not so good recording High price for the low quality....also missing the opening act from the I three's and key songs from the show cut from the disc???
5,Give it up for a true musician,I give much props to the cd you'll always be in my heart. His music is so real to his life. Not only is he my friend he's a music genius. So get ready for the outbreak of charles moore the next micheal jackson. Sincerly DJ_Platnum
1,Broken and cracked on arrival.,Very nice online but arrived with stress fractures in the plate and leg broken on the bowl that cut me taking out of the box. Merry Christmas.
3,JAPANESE EDITION,"There are 15 tracks on the Japanese edition as opposed to 13 on the North American edition, and they're in English contrary to what the genius who listed all 15 tracks as ""JAPANESE TITLE"" wrote."
1,Don't bother,I really wanted this and was so excited when I got it but what a let down. I wanted it to keep the cat litter spills in the bathroom cleaned up. The broom worked a few times and after that the filter doesn't allow for good pick up. What a waste of money! It's quickier to use a dust pan and broom than this broom. It's going back!
1,No way would I buy this again!!,"It's not that the it dosn't function well......for the 1st 2 minutes after a full charge.....then the power starts to go away and it is useless. We can't even finish our kitchen floor with this thing before the charge starts to die and the suction begins to fail. It looks good, you think it will work, but it just dosn't hold any power. WASTE OF MONEY."
2,"It's okay, well kinda---","It is handy. It is a good idea. But there is a technical flaw which makes it's use very limited. The space between the filter and the intake tube is very narrow. If you pick up anything larger than bread crumbs, the debris just jambs up, clogging the intake tube and you have to constantly stop, open it, and dig out the jamb.Emptying the canister is clumbsy because of the weight of the bottom of the tool. You have to juggle the tool with one hand and push a button with the other hand and try to catch the canister. Then put down the stick and use 2 hands to remove the filter and dump the contents. Getting the canister back on the stick is not easy, either.I have emailed the manufacturer about this problem, but they just give me lame replies like ""there is a 1-year defect warranty"" and ""the manual is available online."""
3,works but doesn't really cut it.,"I got this at Target a few weeks ago. the picture on the box shows it ""sweeping and sucking"" soil spilled from a tipped over plant, though i haven't tried this myself I don't think this unit can do it.I also don't think this can't replaced the broom. the brisell are very short, so don't expect to sweep a whole room, this is good for a small area, and good for cleaning up quick spills. (you can use it to sweep a whole room but it'll take you twice the time)I only got this because target's conventional broom and dustpan was nearly 20.00, plus they didn't have a standup dustpan, I paid 40.00 for this and I'm satisfied with it, not thrilled just satisfied.edit, sept 2009. i use this broom still, about once a month to sweep cobweb from the corners. isn't good for anything else.2 stars."
3,better off with a broom,"pluses:1) bought the refurbished version for something like $20.2) pretty good suction (but it can't quite pick up litter).3) good design makes it fairly easy to empty dirt.minuses:1) over time the filter gets clogged with small particles and suction degrades a bit.2) waste of electricity.conclusion:you're better off with a wide broom, which will actually do a better job and do it more quickly."
4,"Great for the price, but a little heavy.","Frist off I would like to say that this does exactly what it claims! I started charging it right away, I couldn't wait to use it. I first used it in my kitchen, then my living room area and it worked great! The big test was the area's around my kitty litter boxes, and it passed with flying colors! It picked up all the litter that the cats had tracked out from the box! It worked great also on the pet hair and dust bunnies. I would have given this product a five, but this unit is much more heavier than I had anticipated. It is a bit of an arm work out if using it on large areas like I have. The wieght also put a strain on my wrist which I thought was odd. However, it works great and I would definatly recomend it to others."
4,It's great.,I've had the Dirt Devil broom for a year and love it. I have a hardwood floor in the kitchen and the broom makes it easy to pick up crumbs and dry food spills. I also love the fact that I don't have to deal with a dustpan and the residue that remains after using it. We've been so pleased that we bought a second one for our vacation home.
3,FAIR OVERALL PERFORMANCE,ON THE PLUS SIDE: UNIT IS RELATIVELY LIGHTWEIGHT AND HOLDS A CHARGE WELL. ON THE MINUS SIDE: SUCTION POWER IS FAIR AT BEST.UNIT MUST BE HELD NEARLY VERTICAL AND PRESSED TOWARD FLOOR TO ENSURE PICKUP OF SMALL ITEMS LIKE LOOSE KITTY LITTER.THE ONLY ADVANTAGE OVER A STANDARD BROOM AND DUST PAN IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BEND OVER TO PICK UP THE DIRT. HARDLY WORTH THE COST UNLESS YOU ARE EXTREMELY LAZY OR HAVE A BAD BACK.
1,poor quality,"I was so excited about getting this product - i always wanted a ""little helper"" in the kitchen. instead i found this cumbersome appliance neither a broom nor a vaccum. poor decision on my part. i will be donating it soon to the sidewalk. very disappointed."
3,It is okay,"It is okay. Not great. After reading many other reviews, it is about what I expected. I paid $30 for it and it is worth that, but not more. Our disappointment is that the trash has nowhere to go. There is a very small openingfor the trash to get into the broom. Otherwise it gets clogged against the filter. No real need for the filter anyway."
3,Dirt Devil Broomvac,I received this as a gift for my birthday. I really like the product. It works great on pet hair. We have 3 cats and a lab so pet hair is in abundance around our house. Sweeping just blew the hair around and I hated hauling out the big vac. The only drawbacks are that the broom is a little heavy and the holding cup has to be emptied often. Of course that may be due to the fact of all the pet hair. Great product!
2,Dirt Devil Broom Vac,Not sure I really like this as much as I thought I would. It doesn't seem to do what the commercial said. I have a dog that sheds and the dog hair also seems to clog the filter really fast. It doesn't suck up the dirt very well either.
1,I'd give it less than one star if I could!,I bought one of these and used it a total of about 4 times before selling it at a tag sale for about a quarter of what I paid for it. I've had good luck with other Dirt Devil products but this was the pits. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
1,Junk,"Don't waste your money on anything from Dirt Devil, Royal, or Hoover. After less than two years, the rubber gasket that seals the dirt cup with the motor housing has disintegrated; making this unit worthless (no suction).According to the Dirt Devil company... this part is unavailable at any price; even though this is a current model!!!Not to mention it did not work all that well even when new."
4,cool and worked,"love doing the stairs now . as with any new invention, you must be open to learn how to use it. no more noisy vac while I clean the tile. I just pile them up and then hit the power button to call it done."
4,Red Broom-Vac,"Rechargeable Broom Vac- RedI bought this Broom-Vac several months ago. I use it only in my bathroom. I was so tired of getting the broom and dust pan out, to pick up my hair that had fallen from blow drying my hair. I find it works better at certain angles. It works great for what I use it for."
2,Good for light pick-up only!,"Bought one of these for each of our kids and ourselves. For some reason, certain colors were cheaper. Red was $15 more? The first time I used it on my tile floor in the kitchen, I was satisfied but not thrilled with it's pick-up. I have dogs with long hair and didn't expect it to perform miracles just a quick clean up in between my daily vacuuming but you have to go slow with it and you do have to stop over the bigger items such as large crumbs. The first time I used it, the charge lasted 10 minutes or so and that seems to be the extent of the charge even after being left on over night. It is angled to get into corners and works great for that. Empties easily as well. Overall I would buy this again but I would pay $25 at Wal-Mart instead of the $39 I paid for it online at Amazon."
1,THIS THING IS WORTHLESS,It worked for less than 4 minutes and now its dead after chargeing it over night it worked for 1 more minuet so i figure thats $10.00 per minuet i could of paid a cleaning lady for that.
4,Good Appliance,"This is the second Dirt Devil broom vac I've owned. The previous one had to be disposed of when the battery finally died after, perhaps, two years of use. I like the thing a lot and use it frequently on hardwood and ceramic floors for pet hair and general light cleaning. It works well, has enough power for my use, and the battery is more than sufficient if you use it like I do--spot cleaning on a daily basis. My only gripes: the battery is not replaceable (one has to wonder if this is a marketing decision, since the battery pack is easy to remove) and the debris canister tends to clog with pet hair, so that the debris flap sticks up in the open position. These are minor gripes, however."
4,Great Product!,"I love this unit, my floor is much cleaner and easier to maintain. If you have a lot of non carpeted areas, then this device is a must have. My wife and I have 2 cats and a dog so we have a lot of hair in the house. This vac does a great job collecting hair and debris from the floor. Other reviewers claim that it does not do well at some angles (which is true), however Dirt Devil designed a brush to sweep that dirt into a pile to use the correct angle to vac it up.The only complaint I have about this would be the battery life. I am very disappointed in the battery life. The charge lasts only about 3 uses until the battery is nearing completion. Maybe the battery is smaller cell battery to make the unit lighter and smaller."
5,Dirt Devil,I have been quite happy with this product...it does light vaccuming of non-carpeted floors and is easy to empty. The grandkids also enjoy using it which is a plus...
3,No more cancer risk than your Xmas Lights,Almost all products with electrical cords carry this warning. They all have lead in them. You won't get cancer with minimal exposure. You need to wash your hands after handling the cord.
3,Good for some purposes,"Bought the Broom Vac once we purchased our home with hardwood and tile floors (and no carpet). The one thing you notice quickly with such a home is that hair balls (we have a dog and cat) accumulate rapidly and continuously. The next thing you realize is that sweeping such ""tumbleweeds"" into a dustpan can be like trying to catch a feather in mid-air.The Broom Vac is very adequate at sucking up these hair balls. However, you will still find yourself constantly pulling accumulations of those not sucked into the bin out of the bristles.Also, the ""sucking"" power is not very great and you must hold the broom almost completely perpendicular to the ground to suck any items other than dust.Expect to cover 1500 sq ft on a single charge for non-regular (every square foot covered) cleanings. 3000 sq ft for those who vacuum regularly."
4,"Great, value for money",I bought this recently for cleaning my kitchen tiles.I use it everyday for light cleaning after cooking.Works great and I think its value for money.
3,Dirt Devil - rechargeable broom-vacuum,"I bought this on the recommendation of someone I work with.I should have tried this at my home for my own needs. It works okay, not great. The reason I tried this broom, is because I wanted something fast to pick up cat litter, and I have to go over the area, more than I thought I would. So, we'll see if I enjoy this broom moreso than a regular broom. I did like the fact that you don't have to use a dustpan.The charge seems to be working pretty good."
5,perfect,"this product arrived exactly as they said it would. It arrived faster than they said it was going to arrive. it was properly packaged and not damaged. I don't know how to get too excited about a lawn sprayer, but this one is just right. bugs and weeds beware! my only complaint might be the capacity of the sprayers much more than my needs are. I believe you can full this sprayer to 25 gallons I thought it might be like a 5 gallon sprayer its huge but that's fine. I do not mean it holds 25 gallons, but will mix/dilute 25."
3,Quite the Bizarre and Unusual Movie..,"This is a cartoon that is not for kids because they wouldn't understand it. It is one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen- the animation, music and sound combine to produce a very strange experience. I bought this on sale somewhere for $2.99 (the EP version - not very good quality) and it was worth every penny! Seriously, I would recommend this because you have to watch it and see for yourself. It is a film with an interesting premise."
3,A deeply flawed presentation,"I loved FANTASTIC PLANET when I first saw it in 1973 and have long wished to see a video or DVD that presented the film in good condition.I must confess that this version looks excellent, but the DVD itself just bugs me beyond belief. ""English WITH english sub-titles""? Why do you need english subtitles if you're watching it in english? Whoever came up with this idea should be sent back to the house. The subtitles are intrusive and interfere with the picture. While there are happily long stretches of the film without dialog, it is still annoying in the extreme.Anchor Bay should seriously reconsider this goofy idea and rerelease this film on DVD so that the english version can be watched without the ridiculously redundant subtitles."
4,Just had to make a comment...,"Taken from a below review.""After 10 minutes, I had enough. First of all, the visual clarity could have been done a whole lot better, especially with the technology at our disposal. Secondly, this film reminds me of the psychedelic 70's or something""um, this movie came out in 1973? first they didn't have the technology we have at our disposal. second, it did come out in the 70s. i wonder why it reminds you of the psychdelic 70s?"
1,"Fantastic Planet, Unfantastic DVD","This should be a five star review, but unfortunately my DVD doesn't work, just freezes when I try to play the movie or select a chapter. I evidently forgot that Facets Video is not a very good company before I ordered this. Too bad Criterion Collection or another label with better quality control standards couldn't have given this the treatment it deserves."
3,3 stars for the film - 0 for this DVD,"This film is an absolute favorite of mine and this DVD release of it is nothing short of sad. The bitrate is WAY too low. The picture is pixelated and frequently all three players I tried this in got angry about the compression. Its a shame. The film itself in incredible and absolutely unique. Also, not that the English dub is bad- but I enjoy the French with subtitles cause it helps makes the film feel even more alien and surreal- but thats not an option on this DVD. It only has the English Dub.The good news is there is a better version available. Look for the region 0 release that has both the French and English language choices. Its still not the best transfer in the world- but a million times better than this one."
4,I remember it.,I saw this when it was released. There was a special debut for it because of it being the sequel to Fantastic Planet. It was very good but not quite as good as Fantastic Planet. I would like to have them both but Savage Planet is not available. I don't remember to much about it other than a war was fought. The animation and creativity behind these movies is remarkable and rivals the Japonese. Its unfortunate that it has not been released considering it was made in the 90ties.
2,light on details,"If you are looking for a ""Cliff's guide"" for options, this is the perfect book. Unfortunately, the book offers absolutely no additional information (infact less information) than that is available for free on websites such as msn moneycentral, yahoo finance, etc. If you are an absolute beginner as far as trading options are concerned and need a book, this one certainly is not the option you should consider! Too pricey for information that is available free on most reputable websites. On the plus side, the graphics in this book is stunning and has creatively used almost all colors invented by humanity...."
3,Good quality but will still kink,Well-made good quality hose but it will still kink. What else needs to be said?
2,Worked okay 1st year - now kinks like crazy,"I bought this to replace a hose that was a bit too short. This hose worked adequately during the first year of use, but since then it kinks like crazy. My blood pressure can't take the aggravation - I'm going back to my old hose."
5,This fantastic book deserves a wider audience.,"I found Mary's book hard to put down, and not because I too am Jewish and my Mother's name is Mary.I really hope some of my progressive Jewish friends read it. It reads so well and is a very deep look into the sickness of the Russian soul and the dreary brutality and horrible corruption which accompanies all collectivism and redistribution.Please read this before you vote for another Democrat."
1,WOOOORST,"This game was absolutely ridiculous. The graphics were horrible, sound was even more horrible."
1,"""Flabbling"" Waste of Time","Being a fan of another alt-hist writer I thought I'd give Harry Turtledove a try. Maybe I should have started with an earlier novel, but I went for a more recent work assuming the author would have developed his writing skill.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I thought ""Settling Accounts"" was a humorless bore with stilted plot development and empty characterizations. Even the cliffhanger ending sputtered out with a yawn. The in-your-face constant use of the ""n"" word,especially in combination with Turtledove's idiotic, parallel universe bending concept of ""population reduction,"" is a straight up insult to every American, black or white, who lives in the South. Perhaps the author hoped those sentiments would stimulate thought and provoke discussion of the subject of racial inequality in the United States, but I found the novel far too juvenile to consider this within the realm of literary exploration. It was simply ugly.Darn, I was hoping to have a new author to follow."
2,Didn't like it,The author gave me no reason to admire or like Marnie. She kept doing things that made me dislike her. I didn't like her mother or the bookclub ladies. The major romantic dilemma was that Eli was afraid of commitment. I never laughed or was surprised.
5,This Book is a MUST READ for All Advisors,"I read this book from cover to cover in one night! There are so many great ideas in it that I had to reread the book to make sure I absorbed them all.I have been a slave to the old model of adding more and more staff to handle the needs of a growing practice. The authors explain how to use technology to streamline our practices, stop drowning in paper, and how to outsource much or all the work currently being done by employees to contractors that work offsite.If I implement all the ideas put forth by the authors, I could save many of thousands of dollars each month and increase my bottom line by the same amount.I highly recommend this book for all practice owners that are interested in reducing their overhead AND increasing client satisfaction and retention."
2,Ideas too old to be of much use,"I'm sure this was a useful book when it was written but now roughly a decade later, it has few useful nuggets for a modern financial planning practice."
5,GREAT DIET MENU,"My husband lost 18 lbs following 'The Sugar Busters' plan within 6 weeks! However the recipes in this book are very limited, as it mainly contains the theory of the plan. Being motivated by the result, I looked for a cook book relevant to the plan and found this one. This cook book features recipes that, while healthful, savory and filling, can be prepared quickly. It contains The Glycemic Index, and the menus are divided in 3 sections, starting from breakfast, lunch and dinner with alot of recipe alternatives. I recommend this book even to those who doesn't even concern about their weights."
3,An okay resource for Diabetics,"I don't think that this book is one of the best Diabetes books I have ever read. I do think that it helps a bit but most of the food tastes like my daughter's school lunches(and they're not that tasty). I guess I'm just not used to foods that do not use sugar as an ingredient. For those who think that this food tastes good, it's great that you can adapt to sugarless foods. It's not that easy for me!"
1,Yuk!,"There aren't many good recipes in here. I realize that without sugar you naturally sacrifice some taste, but this is bad. They never offered up any good alternatives to the sweet that you're giving up, other than artificial sweeteners. I'm not replacing a natural sugar with a chemical. I admittedly have a sweet tooth and this book was less than helpful to me."
2,This diet is to high in fat and it does not work.,I found this book to be loaded with recipes with tons of fat. Snacking on nuts and cheese is not a good way to loose weight. In fact i have been on it a week and my clothes feel snug. This plan does not work. I am going back to low fat eating.
5,A thinner reader from Virginia,"Great recipes!I started this ""lifestyle change"" three weeks ago, and have lost 11 pounds.I've tried just about every fad diet...high-carb,high-protein,you name it.Sugar Busters is different-it's not something you do for two weeks.It's a lifestyle change.This cookbook has made meals easier for me because it provides you with lots of great alternatives.The authors do not suggest you cut out all carbs or eat fatty foods.It truly is a healthier way to eat!"
1,Glad I Didn't Waste Too Much Money on This,I used this as instructed and it didn't follow through with its promise. It is cheaper and more effective to do just old fashioned crunches. This is just another better than crunches gimmick.
3,Too Long for Shipping,"I first found this ITEM at walmart. Apparently someone had ordered it from WM onlineand had returned it to the store. The 1st one I obtained worked well but I reallywanted to trim frontal belly FAT and by improperly using this device IN FRONT,I develeped an umbilical hernia. Use it only to the sides. Works OK. I triedordering a 2nd one from WM online and an unscrupulous company had bought out therights to this from Wal Mart and was charging $19+ for shipping. The company sellingthis through Amazon is the same bunch of scumbags that were charging the $19+ forshipping,but Amazon made them lower the price to $6+ change for shipping and it took10 days to arrive."
3,"OK, but not enough action",We have a mystery here - a murder mystery - and it turns out to be a suicide - sort of.
3,Death at LaFenice,I was hoping for a more riveting mystery after watching them on TV. This was my first e-book. Perhaps I had not learned yet how to use it efficiently. I will be ordering another Leon mystery soon.
4,Whodunnit,"This is a fun read as well as a way to get to know the culture of Venice. I like novels that teach you something along with telling a story. I intend to read the rest of the series, which may take me decades. Leon is one to follow."
3,a gem of the past,"tis is a very good overall background provider and 3-4 yrs ago would be a bible however it is not up to date and does not contain good info re IMRT(intensive radiation) or robotic surgery( Da Vinci Machine)- it is excellent re diet but needs to be supplemented(or a new edition perhaps) to get the latest on possible procedures, side effects and outcomes"
5,Review of Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide to surviving prostate cancer,"This book is great, I would recommend it to anyone who is facing issues with being diagnosed with prostate cancer. Very informative and concise."
2,out of date,"though the best of its time, this book was copyrighted in 2001 and written in 2000. 10 years of research results are in since. This new reseach, on methods just started when the book was written is much more favorable toward radiation treatment than it was using the major approach when the book was written.Readers be advised to seek more recent writings and check online for reports coming out even in the last three months.Be advised that recently published on kindle does not mean recently written or published in print. I made that mistake."
5,Perhaps the ultimate Marseille-type tarot deck!,"I can only echo others in saying that the clarity, the colours, and the general production values make this a superb Marseille tarot deck. If this is the style of tarot you want, with unillustrated pip cards, then you can't do better than this beautiful deck. I got it simply as a collector piece, but such is its subdued ""magic"" that I'm encouraged to use it for readings. I really, really like it! I hope Kris Hadar continues the excellent work: it would be great if the books Hadar has written were available in English!"
5,The only one that has lasted for me,"My experience has been the complete opposite of the other reviewer's.This is the best nozzle I've owned. That's why I sought out the metal version. I've had 4 of the ""new"" metal ones for 5 years now and they still work perfectly."
2,"Great format, many mistakes","This book would serve it's purpose as a test prep if there weren't so many obvious mistakes. On two of the practice tests, the answer was listed as one thing, and the ""reason for the answer"" gave a completely different answer to the question. Makes it hard for someone to know if they have the information or not.For instance, the true answer to a question was ""B"", but when it explained why the answer was ""B"", it actually explained that the answer was ""D""."
2,very borderline test prep book,"I'd buy Kaplan if I had it to do over again; I was won over by the two practice tests in this book and it was a mistake. I took the practice test on the CSET site- a must!- before I looked at the book and I felt pretty good about section I (lit and history) before I started. (I haven't looked at the math/science section yet.) When I took the practice test I found that it didn't mirror the CSET test very well and when I read the REA section, I found that it didn't even prepare me for their own practice test. I was more wobbly on Section III (phys ed, music, art, health). What I lacked there was some terminology and sheet music familiarity. The book ended up not covering any of this material at all. I was really worried as I really need that stuff for the official CSET practice test. I found fill-ins and my actual test didn't have as much sheet music 'reading' on it as the practice test, so I was lucky, but I didn't feel this book prepared me and it had LOTS of errors."
5,Absolutely key for long distance running,"I am a true believer in the Clif line of sports/running products. I started running in winter of 2008 with the NY Road Runners and have worked my way up to two half-marathons. Every time I run any distance, I always carry some Clif electrolyte replacement drink and Clif Shot with me. The difference between running with and without is night and day. Can't recommend enough. Just ordered their post-running muscle drink. I'll wait and see, but expect nothing but continued excellence!"
4,HOW TO TRANSFORM A CAT HATER TO A CAT LOVER,"I am not a cat fancier, but after reading this book I would be willing to get a cat. This book does not have the intensity of humor or sadness that My Dog Skip has, but it is still a well written and interesting book. Morris gives good descriptions of his other household cats and their differences in their personalities. By all means, this is a fine book to read aloud to your whole family. I read this to my wife and she enjoyed it along with me."
1,"Writing: 4 Stars, Advice: 0 Stars","Pet ownership is a responsibility as well as a joy. Owners who do not safeguard their pets are not doing the pets any favors; they are simply being irresponsible owners.When Morris writes, ""I felt that [Spit McGee] should have one chance at least to become a father"" I wanted to reach into his grave and slap him. In numerous other places he endangers his cat (and I assume dog in the earlier book) in the name of misplaced anthropomorphized freedom.These books should come with parental advisories: kids, don't try this at home."
2,Only got 5 games,"I just got this today. It says you get nine games, but I only got five. And one of the Four Winds game keeps give me a Addon2vb.dll error, whatever that is.That leaves only four out of the nine that is supposed to be on the cd. The four games that work are fun. I enjoy them. The only negative I have about the games the four games that work is that graphics are not that sharp."
4,Navarro: A New Spanish Star is Born,Diana Navarro is excelent. She is a natural born singer and her voice is unique. She is an extraordinary example of the new generation of the spanish singers.
1,Not a good investment,"The crossbow seemed nice for the first two shots I took with it, however on the third shot the leather pouch broke making the device pretty useless."
2,Arrived broken,"Unfortunately I had to return this due to the little candy canes being broken off beyond repair. Also, the quality of the manufacturing of this Annalee was below my expectations as compared with other Annalee purchases on Amazon."
3,Too Big!!,"I liked all of the handbag unless the size is TOO big (its really big), and in the picture seems much more small"
1,Broke during first use,"When I turned the hose on, the top of the nozzle flew off. The parts cannot be put back together. This product was useless."
4,If Dr. Strangelove was made a few decades later...,Intelligent and fun. Paints a great picture of politics and the empty shirts therein. The main character dares venture within not understanding that shallow people (like shallow waters) are most turbulent and unpredictable. A movie results.
2,region locked,"ive ordered alot of blurays from Amazon and America, being from Australia ive never had a problem with region locking, btu this disc is 100% region locked so beware if you dont have a player that can do region A, heard good things btu unable to watch =("
1,Bad Movie,"If I could give this zero stars I would. I wanted to like this movie because it had so many actors from the UK and some from America that I like, but the characters are so jerky and slimmy that I just couldn't.Tom Hollander who plays the dimwitted Englishman who always sticks his foot in his mouth, is probably the only likeable character in the entire movie, the only problem is that he's not the lead. Peter Capaldi is, he plays a jerk with a potty mouth that is so bad, he'd make drunken sailor's cry. I really wanted him to be bumped off, but it wasn't that sort of movie.This is the worst political comedy I've ever seen, okay I don't normally watch political comedies, but it is pretty bad.This movie is not rated, but it it was, it would be R."
4,Truly Funny Movie,"This movie was truly terrific. Well acted, well written and pretty well filmed too for an independent film. It was very funny and engaging."
4,Satire about politics and diplomacy,"If you like to watch (political) satire, this is a perfect movie for you. Director takes no prisoners in this story. The characters are high ranking professional politicians from England and US. When one of the the British ministers makes public (mis)statement, story unravels and so do international events and affairs that lead us to United Nations negotiatins between major world powers who must make a decision if the large scale war should be initiated or not.All characters are well thought out. From young political rookies and interns in the White House to crass and obnoxious old political timers and croonies who are more interested in keeping their jobs and positions than in how their decisions are affecting the world they are supposedly in charge of. Dialogue in this film is unconventional and smart that at times we can almost feel that actors were having fun with it too during making of the film. Delightful film."
5,knife,"best pocket knife ever. My old one broke after ten years (my fault), this was a replacement. Incredibly sharp, wonderfully light."
3,I think you probably had to see this show to appreciate it best.,"I love hearing alternate takes on this show besides John Cameron Mitchell's. This show takes chances and makes changes, some good and some not so good, but I enjoyed it for the most part.The Hedwig on this CD sounds like Steven Tyler from AEROSMITH, except that he is more often off pitch than on, and lets the actress singing Yitzhak handle all the hard stuff, which makes the CD hard to listen to and enjoy just for its musicality. This is especially rough on the ear during songs like ""Wicked Little Town"".I also think including the preshow banter at the start of the CD was a mistake - it takes a minute and a half for the music to start. The audience participation section of ""Wig in a Box"" I found annoying as well."
4,Very pleased!,"Have had a basketball system in the driveway for 8 years. This will be our 3rd backboard. Needless to say it gets a lot of action!! We have 2-6 boys on it most days of the year and we live in Texas with hot summer heat. I needed something that would be a little stronger and have a good ""feel"" to it. Researched, researched, researched and depending on the site it's seems to be a toss up over acrylic vs poly. I finally went with this one and my son says it is BEAST!! I was worried about a thud like the park backboards. No problems, no complaints. Everyone has a goal in there driveway and ours is still the preferred choice.Hope this is helpful!"
4,Good product,We ordered this backboard and rim combo to replace our previous backboard and rim that was damaged during a storm. The item arrived in perfect condition and easily mounted on our system.
5,Well... it's fish oil,"What can I say, its a good product, barely no after taste. I am going to purchase it again when I run out."
5,Great product,"It is fish oil, enough said. It seems to be pretty easy on my stomach. I do get some ""fishy burps"" from time to time. I feel more aware and alert when I use this product. I would recommend to any serious weight lifter or to anyone who just wants some brain food"
2,Picture doesn't match product received,"If you don't mind what color the housing, liquid, or the etchings on top... then buy this. If you want the one in the picture, don't buy it... it's not the one you will get. Mine has white housing and clear liquid inside instead of green.The one thing that really pulls this rating down is the quality of the liquid inside. It creates tiny bubbles very easily and they push the larger bubble to the side so it takes a while for the tiny bubbles to dissipate and give an accurate reading."
4,The Magician...a well deserved reputation.,"Up front, I'll admit I don't care for most of the selections in this 2 disk album; the second disk virtually is wasted on me. Thats why its not a 5-star for me. That being said, the Liszt, Wagner, Smetana, and Rimsky-Korsakov pieces are well worth the price of admission. Stokowski's coloration of arrangement and tempo are remarkable. His Hungarian Rhapsody and Wagner pieces are so unique, its like hearing the old war horses for the first time. Its a shame most of Stokowski's performances predate high fidelity."
4,Does the Job,This amplification wiring kit does the job. I did not use some pieces because I wired it directly to the car battery. Instructions in set were not very clear.
1,A Has-been,"Jea's UndergroundTrader.com site is overrated. I don't know anybody who has subscribed to it who ever made any money consistently. The pre March 2000 bull market spawned so many books like this and so many pseudo-gurus. I know someone who got this book, he was all hyped up about it, but lost money using or trying to use the so-called strategies and he had to go back to the real world and get a J-O-B, ouch! If anyone has actually made any money from his site or from his book, by all means post here with specifics. So far none have. If you can't show me the money, don't waste people's time posting here."
3,11 hits!! amazing,"If you're reading this you probably guess I save hits ofpopular music from 1940 forward to today. Frankie Carle had14 hits according to Billboard, and 11 of them are here. Whatelse has to be said? But it if you want your collection toreflect what was popular in the era you're reviewing, then thisis a must buy."
3,YUASA motorcycle battery,This is a wet cell battery. Battery acid was not included. Be carefull to make sure they include battery acid if you choose to purchase this battery.
5,Helpful for explaining adoption process to children.,"My husband and I are in the process of completing paper work to get on a list to adopt a child from China. I happened upon this book at a bookstore and loved it immediately. We have already read it to our almost-3-year-old biological child to help explain the process of filling out paperwork and then waiting to hear about our new child. It has been a good way to introduce the topic of adoption. Our daughter asks for it often and has requested that we name our new child ""May."" :-) The pictures and story are simple enough to interest a very young child but have enough depth to interest a child in the early elementary grades (or even older).I highly recommend this book to anyone waiting to adopt a child internationally (especially from China)."
4,"good story, illustrations could be better","We are adopting from China. I bought this book to read to my young daughter. It does stimulate conversation. For the adult that has to read it over and over, I wish the illustrationis were more appealing. The story line is nice and easy for kids to understand. I find it a useful book, but not high quality children's literature."
5,Great Reference Book,The World Radio TV Handbook is a great source for information about radio and TV around the world. The book is very easy to use with stations being listed by country and frequency. There is a great station by frequency listing at the back as a cross reference. Also included are articles on radio listening and reviews of equipment. This is the best reference guide for world wide listening.
1,Poor Narration; Weak Book,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of Anne Rice. Without hesitation, I would give five stars to the audio CD of ""Servant of the Bones."" What happened? The premise of this book is theretelling of the story of Jesus, when he is a young boy. The author borrows from the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and the New Testament. But the combination doesn't work. First of all, the narrator is weak; True, he is supposed to be a quite young, but his voice doesn't have direction or strenght...after all, he ""is"" supposed to be Jesus! Other aspects of the book are unconvincing. The idea that Philo, the great intellectual of Alexandria, desperately wanted the 7 year oldJesus as a student of Jewish scripture is simply not believable.I wanted to like this book, but it doesn't match Anne Rice's earlier efforts."
2,"Christ, The Lord is Boring!","As an Anne Rice fan of her earlier works, and having an interest in biblical fiction, I looked forward to reading this book. I found it extrememly boring. Nothing much seemed to happen plot-wise and it was very slow. I have read books before where the plot itself was slow, but the relationships between the characters were deep and involved, which kept the reader's interest. This book did not even have much in the way of character development, making Mary and Joseph seem shallow and bland. There was even this one character who kept laughing all the time in the first half of the book - I never could figure out why he was laughing all the time, and it began to annoy me! The end of the book did pick up somewhat and began to hold my interest, but overall, a tedious read."
2,Moves at a snail's pace,"It's a good concept, and some truly dazzling sentences occasionally shine out among the (forgive me) awful prose. But it's just so dang BORING! The journey from Alexandria to Bethlehem, which could easily have been covered in three chapters, drags over half the freaking book. There's so much repetition, and tiny short repetitive sentences alternating with huge, paragraph-long sentences, that I just couldn't bring myself to finish the last 1/4. I can't picture, or care about, any of the characters, including our young protagonist."
2,First-person voice of Jesus is problematic,"This book is an interesting view of something we really know nothing about , the early years of Jesus Christ. The Bible provides very little information on what Jesus was like as a young boy so Anne Rice is as free as anyone to speculate about it, I suppose.Still I think her writing this book in the first-person, giving you a direct window on Jesus' mind, is problematic. It is one thing to try to imagine the circumstances of Jesus' early years. It is quite another to delve into his consciousness. It puts quite a strain on the ""willing disbelief"" that any reader must bring to work of fiction, especially a story so presumptuous as the one Ms. Rice has written here.[...]"
2,Starts really well but a little slow towards the middle/end,"This book started out really well, but halfway through, I found it lacking in excitement and story line...Although the research involved in this book appears to be extensive, it looses a little bit of the story line, focusing too much on Jesus thoughts...Not a bad read, just a little slow.."
4,Thought provoking ...,"Beautifully written, wonderfully researched, and reverent story of what Jesus' life might have been like as a young boy. I found the Jewish history woven into the story illuminating and appreciated the greater understanding it gave me of Jewish law & tradition. It is fascinating to me that as I learn Jewish law & tradition I see even more clearly God's great love for us & Christ's fullfillment of the law and prophecies.I hope Ms. Rice continues to write on the life of Christ. I would look forward to the next installment in the story of Christ the Lord."
5,Enjoyable Read,"This account of the childhood years of Jesus kept me entertained and looking forward to any future installments of the story that Ms. Rice may write.Since reading her first published novel years ago, I've always felt that Rice has a real talent for first-person narration. I believe she displays that talent well in this novel. She quickly draws the reader into the story by the convincing strength of her character's ""voice"".I think if you approach this story keeping in mind that it is the author's FICTIONAL ""take"" on the early life of Jesus, you'll find it is an enjoyable read."
3,Intresting.,"This wasn't one of my favorites of Anne Rice. It was a great begining but kind of dragged here and there. Rice give a great historical point of view of Jesus, and makes you really wonder if this truly happend. It gives a new perspective to Jesus' life."
2,I guess I was reading the wrong book,"Unlike others here, I found the book dull and tedious and could hardly wait to get to the end (I never quit a book once I start)....a real snoozer"
2,Great subject; great possibilities; poor execution.,"I really only finished the book because it had so much potential. While the development of how Jesus came to be a 30 year old man in full ministry, found in the Gospels, was included, and intriguing, Anne Rice's telling should have been a much shorter novel. For me, a disappointing read."
3,Christ the Lord: Into Boredom,"This book was highly recommended by a person who usually recommends quality books, so I anticipated checking this out at my local library and delving right into it. At no point during this ""novel"" did I become inspired or moved. While the whole idea of writing a book concerning Jesus' early days is fantastic, actually putting that plan into action and putting it onto paper is another story - no pun intended. There could have been so much more done with this book. The ending was somewhat inspirational, but never fully grasped my attention, and had the effect in which i thought it would. I can't say I want to brag about this book with my fellow readers. Make sure you dont bore yourself when you're not reading this one."
1,Jesus made boring,"My bookclub picked this book and the decision was unanimous: Boring! It takes some talent to make a bloody riot in Jerusalem a yawn, but somehow Anne Rice managed it. The most interesting part of the book was the Author's Note in the back. However, all the extensive research Rice claims to have done doesn't really show itself. The book is strangely devoid of any sense of realism. Rice's characters all feel distant and undeveloped. Even her efforts to add historical context feel sketchy. My suggestion? If you want a novel about the early years of Jesus, read Christopher Moore's ""Lamb: The Gospel According to Jesus' Childhood Friend."" It doesn't even pretend to be Biblically or historically accurate, but you care far more for this Jesus than Rice's hollow portrayal."
2,Slow Read & Missing Something,"I agree with another reviewer that it is a slow read and does not have a ""plot"" per say. There just was not a lot of ""meat"" to the story. Perhaps that is because the detailed childhood of Jesus was not historically documented. I enjoyed reading about the author's vision of Jesus as a child and the other people in his life. I must say that I came away luke warm but will have an open mind regarding reading her upcoming books."
2,I didn't like it,I loved Anne Rices' other stuff but was really bored with this. I read 100 pages and gave up on it. I wish she'd go back to the Vampires.
1,Doesn't Support 1080p on PS3,"Contrary to the manufacturer's claims, this device is not fully compatible with all HDMI devices for 1080p content. Case in point, the screen flickers constantly when connected to a PS3 set at 1080p resolution. Connecting the PS3 directly to the TV eliminates the issue, so the problem is clearly with this device rather than the PS3.Seems to be work fine with my Apple TV, but it's content doesn't go up to 1080p.if you intend to use this for 1080p content, buyer beware."
1,DOA out of the box - TWICE!~,"I ordered this because I thought it would look great with my Apple TV. The first one would not power up out of the box. Amazon replaced it fast and the replacement arrived today with the same problem! The thing would not power up right out of the box. Amazon is great, but this product is totally LAME!"
1,Uhhh....oh..k??,Uhhh....This is zee uhhgliest thing ive EVER seen....Imagine this thing walking down your neighbourhood street on Halloween.......It would be the scariest costume!! It's uhhgly and yeah that's all there is to it!
2,Does the memory of Jason still haunt you? It does me too but not as much as bad filmmaking.,"The acting is so bad it's... yeah it's bad. Let's not forget that a Voorhees isn't the killer in this movie. It's a Jason impersonator pissed over the horribly grotesque death of his son. Yeah, that's it. Hey, look on the bright side though, there is a lot of killing!"
3,THE KILLING IS ON BUT ITS NOT JASON,This time at a halfway house the brutal serial stalks and kills but the survivors seem to reveal that its an imposter
2,ONE OF THE WORST IN THE SERIES! 1 1/2 STARS!,"I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.We thought it was over, but you can't keep a good horror icon down! Jason's back....uh not really, but more of the same in the lackluster entry in the franchise.The DVD transfer in good enough for this installment."
3,A New Beginning of Fear,"A New Beginning is not a really good installment of the saga, on account that jason is dead. On the other hand there are still some good qualaties to this installment. Tommy is back but in a different actor, new weapons such as garden tools and chainsaws, and the return of the everless gore, and the hockey mask. The story though is not bad, haunted by the events in the Final Chapter Tommy is sent to a sort of group home where he still haunted by the hockey-masked killer in his new form. This edition isnt scary at all. In fact there isnt one time where i went eww. This one has a new quality such as comedy and other sorts, but never reaches up to its potential and fails to make a space in the Thriller/Horror section. Although this wasnt bad and I have seen worse."
1,"""The absolute worst in the entire series...""","This is the stupidiest Jason film I have ever seen, I mean, what were they thinking when they decided to make a Jason without Jason?! This movie so ..., and what kind of Friday the 13th is it if it's just a guy that has nothing to do with Jason or Crystal Lake's past. Take my advice and do not buy this filth, I suggest looking at parts 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and X."
2,Friday The 13th Part V(5) A New Beginning,"Very weak and bizarre and not in a good way,it took 5 movies that mess it up,the 4th was decent and now this part 5 made no sense,you have a cameo From Corey Feldman who was the last but then he grows up and is played by another actor,then you find other parts that don't make sense that I wouldn't want to post and spoil here and when you get to the end It is even more silly,the movie seems more an unfunny comedy or dark comedy than Horror."
3,it's the real jason.,"part 5 a new beginning is not the best f-13 movie made, but it's still entertaining. many peaple say it isnt jason behind the mask, but indeed it is. from what we learned from the final friday is that jason vorhees is an evil curse that can ressurrect it-self in as many bodys that it feels it should to fulfill its task. the only movie that jason wasnt in was f-13 part 1. his mother was the killer in that movie. now on to the dvd, sound & picture looks great but i wish they will release a copy with the original cover picture, you know the hockey-mask with the red glowing in the back ground."
3,Another Paramount censorship job,"Like all the films in the Friday the 13th series, this one also suffered heavy censorship in order to obtain that precious R-rating. My advice would be to pass on this film until Paramount smartens up."
1,"""New Beginning"" gets off on the wrong foot","""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" is much like Jason himself. A body with no soul. ""Paramount Pictures"" decided to keep going w/ this series after the 33 million dollars ""The Final Chapter"" raked in during the Spring of 1984. Not a good idea. Tommy Jarvis, still having nightmares about a certain pissed off goalie, is transferred to a boarding house for troubled teens. Once he arrives, the body count starts to rise & all fingers start to point to Tommy. What could have been a decent whodunnit is turned into a waste of the viewers' time (not that the first four were anything to right home about, either, but, at least those ""Friday"" films had much more suspense & if your going to have a ""Friday the 13th"" film, have Jason in the damn movie!). ""Juwanna Man"" himself, actor Miguel A. Nunez Jr., shows up as Demon, the gang leader who gets speared in the outhouse. Still want to see it? Didn't think so."
1,A new hustle,"What a gyp! In this Friday The 13th, a clone goes around killing people while poorly imitating Jason. Friday The 13th wasnt known for stellar acting(the kills made up for the acting) but the acting this time around is so over the top corny that it's hard not to take notice(especially those stupid yokels). The kills are pathetic(strapping a guy's head to a tree?) and when he shoved the electrical wire in the boy's mouth I laughed till I peed a little. In the end they find out that it was the same dirty cop who teased those kids in the beginning for being scared. I can only recommend you this movie if you want a good laugh at a bad horror flick. If you looking for a good Friday The 13th flick, this is not it. This is the biggest swindle in horror movie history since Halloween III: Season Of The Witch."
1,this movie sucks,"ok i will go right to the point, u want good friday the thirteen slasher movies? check out parts 1 2 3 and 4, the only ones worth watching, in part 5 the effects are bad, and it gets even worse, it's not even jason doing the killings. the only friday the 13th dvds that i own are 1 2 3 and 4 and of course freddy vs jason restored balance in this series."
1,One of the worst...,"This has to be one of the worst friday the 13th movies ever made. It ranks as the 2nd worst on my list The worst being Jason goes to hell. The problems with this movie would have to be the lame story, the lame characters, too much female nudity(not enough male), and finally too much swearing. I wouldn't waste my time with this video unless you're a true Jason fan. And even then, you'll be disapointed."
3,jason vs freddy 3,jason hacks up people in and around a psyche hospital.sounds like a nightmare on elm st part 3.from here to part 6 he gets done and goes back to the lake for part 6.jason movies are so straightfoward!i think theres something sexy about a crazy chick in hospital greens all whacked out on psycho trops.every movie with crazy people has annoying drs and nurses running about.the message is.........youre not safe anywhere!belive it.this movie is just a morbid reminder!
2,Pee Pot Poor,"Man, what a turkey. I rather enjoy the friday films but this one is a real dog. Perhaps theres an uncut version out there? The one i saw had the mark of the censor's blade all over it. It appears the censor made more cuts in this one than the killer. The gore was minimal. There was one of the higher body counts in the series but wheres the carnage? Seeing the ax come down and then hearing a scream while the camera pans around everywhere but the crime scene doesn't cut it. This is friday the 13th. let the blood run in rivers. Then theres the charaters. There wasn't one in the bunch you can feel for. Hey, part 3 had shelly. Part 4 had little tommy. This one? Nothing. Just some stiff playing an older tommy who you hope would just get the ax. Then theres ""Jason"". I'm not going to go into this atrocity in any real detail but lets just say he's not quite himself in this one. Overall, A boring, uninspired and tame entry into the series. Just go from part 4 to 6."
3,"Some new ideas, but the same old theme is present as ever.","Tommy, who killed ice-hockey fan Jason Voorhees as a child, has been in a psychiatric institution ever since. Now eighteen, he is transfered to a halfway house, but still suffers from halucinations, nightmares and uncontrollable rage.Though there is more of a story this time, the 'surprise ending' is given away far too early and the scenes of nudity are completely pointless. The opportunity of creating sympathetic characters and the reasons for their mental illness is totally wasted and all we're presented with is another load of dozy teenagers. But on the other hand, the dream/halucination sequences are refreshingly original, there are some interesting characters outside the halfway house, the camerawork is good and on a whole the film is certainly a lot more watchable than the tedious Parts 1 and 2."
3,"The ""HalloweeN III"" of the Friday the 13th series.","This film is the ""HalloweeN III"" of the Friday the 13th series, simply because it dosnt really involve Jason. But it still has the same graphic murders as the others."
2,Jason takes a nap,"this is not the best one but it's ok, after the last confrontation with jason, Tommie Jarvis, is sent to a half-way house. Things appear to be normal until one of the kid's is murded and Tommie is seeing thing, Jason!. The best thing about the movie is the suprise ending!. END"
2,Dreadful,This was an awful sequel. I think they should have just stopped after part 4 if they couldn't make anything better.
3,Where the hell is Jason?,"After watching the first half of this film, I asked myself, where is Mr. Vorhees. He is nowhere to be found in this poor sequel to Part 4, my favorite of the Fridays. The gore and the nudity bring the flick's rating up to three stars."
1,Smaller than expected - disappointing,"I was unhappy with this purchase. The solids are smaller than they should be - the advertisement clearly says 1""x1""x1"", but the tetrahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron are all smaller. The tetrahedron in particular looks very small. The cube and octohedron are 1"" in their longest diagonal only.Plus, for the cube and dodecahedron, the facets were not well proportioned. Since that is the point behind these objects, the quality of production was inadequate.Think twice before buying."
2,Rotary sprinkler,"Decent sprinkler, kind of cheap feeling but for the price that is to be ecpected. It leaked pretty bad when I first got it so I had to use some teflon tape to help it seal. also the product came extremely dusty. The sprinkle pattern is pretty weak too."
5,Real Reality,"The Endless Knot is a masterpiece. It's set in a Los Angeles very like the real one, only more so. One by one, the Catholic Bishops of Los Angeles are getting killed --- in horrible ways; as with any good mystery, you begin to realize that soem of the corpses deserve it. In the light of what's happening in the Catholic Church today, you find yourself wondering if Biersach knows more than he's telling! Certainly, it's pretty up to date. But there is a lot more; it's mystery alright, but it's also an occult thriller --- and a fantasy novel! And there's alot of humor as well. Biersach makes his secondary world come alive, with characters you are really interested in. Any you don't need to be Catholic to enjoy it, any more than you need to be Navajo to read Hillerman. It leaves you wondering where the novel ends, and real life begins. Great stuff, and I recommend it highly!"
5,One of the few books in my library I've read more than twice! Actually I'm on my 5th time through!,"Catholic or not, this book is a fabulous read. I learn something new with each time through and find myself underlining references to other books, etc. to look up later. I learned much about the Traditional Catholic Faith and highly recommend this read."
3,OLD BOOK FOR AN OLD CAR,This was not as good has previous Chiltens Manuals I have purchased. It is however a great timesaver when I need to try to repair items such as the dash illumination.
3,"Interesting study of Stangl, but Vatican info is erroneous","Sereny's study of Stangl is fascinating reading, but her chapter that tries to implicate the Vatican is misleading. In hindsight it is easy to point fingers and say that the Vatican was ""ambivalent"" towards the death camps (some people even try to go a step further and say that this silence was complicity). However, the truth is that the Vatican is usually slow and cautious to react to situations; preferring to study, verify, and confirm things first before passing judgement. People who criticize the Vatican today have the luxury of being able to look back on history and make an easy decision about the evil that occurred; those who were actually present at the time did not have the luxury of this vantage point."
1,Not worth the time or money,"This bow saw is not worth the time required to purchase it! It is very lightweight and flimsy. The release latch is made of cheap plastic. It has a plastic bladeguard that broke the first time it was removed. Worse yet the blade is loose enough that it flexes and twists from side to side when cutting making it impossible to make a straight cut. It is extremely difficult to use a back and forth sawing motion since it doesn't want to go forward. It jams and twists in the attempt. We have tried this saw on everything from 12"" logs to 1"" branches with the same result. Save yourselves the pain and buy another brand."
5,Enjoy actual footage of the real Seabiscuit.,"If you enjoyed the 2003 film starring Jeff Bridges and Toby Mcquire half as much as I did, then you are sure to enjoy the documentary on this famous horse. I'll be the first to admit that I'm a sucker for the underdog and after seeing this year's blockbuster movie about this awesome animal, I wanted to learn as much as I could about this inspirational true life story. Originally filmed in black & white and now available in vibrant color, this documentary shows footage of Seabiscuit as a colt through his triumphant victory over War Admiral. The story of Seabiscuit allows me to appreciate the struggle we face in life and reminds my that obsticles can be overcome. So if this story has any effect on you and you're interested in seeing some exceptional footage of this incredible animal, then this documentary is a must have."
2,A little disappointing - not enough documentary,"I'm a huge fan of documentaries, but this video contains too many scenes of current horse races and interviews with people (who are totally unrelated to the story) about what they thought of Seabiscuit. But on the plus side, the video did contain some facts regarding jockey George Woolf that I found interesting because I've never seen it before in any other related documentary."
3,Seabiscuit,Would have been better if I hadn't seen the movie. Mostly racing footage. Not much about Red Pollard. Kinda made it seem that Ice Man was the hero.
4,Ladies Seiko watch,"The watch is beautiful. However I miss not having the hand to mark the seconds. Battery was dead at the time I received it, so I paid to replace it."
4,nice sprayer,This nozzle sprayer is just basic but iy does a really good job of doing what it was designed to do. It is areally nice product for the low price. It is just what I needed.
5,Great Jazz Trio !!!,"These guys really cook together. One cd is studio made and the other is live. If you love great melodic jazz than this cd set is for you.Great guitar, Great piano, and Great bass. Smoking !!!!"
2,A more in-depth book is what is needed here!,"Dispite a couple bad rewiews, I purchased the book anyway. My mistake! This book is for people wanting to make cute little home pages with pics of their kitty, just like the author. It shows how to crop and paint a little but not much more than that. I learned as much just tinkering with the PSP prog as I did from the book. He promotes his website like it is some type of dynamic creation. It in fact is a lousy little site with pics of his kitty. The author uses it merely to try to sell more books. Unbelievable! Don't be another sucker and buy this pittiful excuse for a manual. (The PSP manual is almost as good.) Purchase something with some guts to it!"
3,so-so,It's very helpful that the book is in color but I expected more from it. Doesn't go much beyond the basics. A little overpriced for the material covered.
3,Sophisticated,"I love the sophistication of this mystery series, and it has a more cutting edge to it than the similar time period series of Maizie Dobbs. It's even richer if you're familiar with the Sherlock Holmes tales, but that isn't necessary. As Mary Russell travels the world solving one mystery after another, much is learned about each unique setting. I would, however, like to learn more about the dynamic of the relationship between Russell and Holmes. I appreciated the short story detailing their first meeting, but I wish I were closer to the dynamics of the relationship itself. King seems to be avoiding going too deep into those waters."
4,Wonderful World of Disney!,"Treasure of Matecumbe is another family action film from Disney. Although not one of their best-known or higher budget movies, this one still manages to entertain. Lots of adventure, some decent stars, and the Disney talent for filmmaking..."
3,A Study Of Suicide,"A very good book on suicide by someone who is personally intimate with the subject. Recounts the suicide of one of his close friends, the poet Sylvia Plath, and his own failed suicide attempt. A very personal look at suicide and the way various cultures have looked at it. Defects includes the author's confusuion of psychology and literature, as well as not exploring personal motives deeply enough."
2,mcculloch mt700 broken,Tool worked ok first year. Stored 1 year. Pull cord now stripped and will not turn engine. Tried again and almost started (bad click noise from pull cord) then cord broke. Oh well.
3,Not what I expected,"This is a much of the same as ""Fellowship"" soundtrack but lacks the enthusiasm. Additionally, the music which accompanies the trailer is absent from this soundtrack. I found this to be highly disappointing but a brilliant example of deceptive marketing.This soundtrack lacks punch and originality. See the movie first-"
2,just okay,"This soundtrack wasn't great. It wasn't bad either. It was just okay. If you have the first Lord of the Rings soundtrack, don't buy this one. It's much better. This one has some good songs, but you didn't get bored listening to the first one."
5,Best movie soundtrack since Star Wars,"Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings sountracks are easily the best movie soundtracks since Star Wars (I mean the original trilogy). This is a masterpiece. It combines beautiful, heart-rendering songs (particularly any of the Elves' themes) with great action/adventure scores (the Fellowship theme). The soundtrack has such emotional power that, even without seeing the scenes in the movie, you can just feel what's going to happen.The Two Towers is probably the softest of the trilogy. Many of the songs are gentler, almost sweet, especially the Elven themes. This album doesn't have quite the overpowering epic scale as the first two, but is probably the best to listen to if you're reading or ever just want to take a walk. Of course, the song for the credits (known affectionately as ""Gollum's Song"") is wonderful.This soundtrack (and the rest of the trilogy) is destined to become a classic. My only question is whether Howard Shore will produce the Hobbit soundtrack..."
4,"Combination of celtic, epic and obscure","The soundtrack to the second installment of Lord Of The Rings brought mixed feelings to me. In general, it didn't sound like a soundtrack that can easily stand on its own, i.e. outside of the movie. The music combined the epic character of the movie's ""good guys"" (Aragorn and company), with a more sinister sound that went very well with the dark moments around the two towers, and a bucholic celtic sound that was unmistakably stapled to all the scenes with the hobbits in them. However, the songs that really stood out to me were the more glorious ones that had something to do with the scenes with elves, in general, the songs that counted in them with the presence of the great voices of Isabel Bayrakdarian, Sheila Chandra, Elizabeth Fraser and Emiliana Torrini, which closed the movie in a very eerie way. All in all, a good soundtrack with a handful of great songs and a very Braveheart-like sound to most of the rest of them."
3,Average with a song here and there thats good,"The soundtrack probably works well with the movie but it is pretty bland otherwise. The only thing I really liked was ""Evenstar (feat. Isabel Bayrakdarian)"" which sounded fantastic. The track really brought Tolkien's world to life and captured the essence of Tolkien's story about the Elfs (""Fighting the long defeat"") and Arwen Evenstar (Lúthien). Anyway, I should probably warn you about ""Gollum's Song (performed by Emiliana Torrini)"" which I absolutley hated. I kept thinking about James Bond music while litening to it. WT*Beep*! The rest of the soundtrack while not bad just bored me. Been there done that, yawn.Btw, the trailer featured a butchered version of Clint Mansell's Requiem For a Dream score for some reason."
5,WOW!,"Although I am not the most inclined fan of the LOTR trilogy (I truely don't find anything SUPER FANTASTIC about it, but it's great though), the Two Towers soundtrack is awesome! Highlights of the OST are:Foundations Of Stone - great opening strings piece (very moving), and nice homage to Khaza-dum themeEvenstar - the choral piece is very soothing musicBreath Of Life - just like EvenstarIsengard Unleashed - begins like a track from Gladiator OST, in that voices are like that of Lisa Gerrard with Hans Zimmer's instrumentationsGollum's Song - very mysterious, but musically interestingSome MINOR downfalls:Many soft portions of music (hard to hear if have no good bass)Some unlikeable changes from the movie edit (in Foundations Of Stone, loud voices before Gandalf's abyss descent)These aside, this is worth buying! It has a great diversity in soundscapes."
5,Better than Fellowship's score,"I loved this score, even more than the first one. I found the Fellowship's score alright but mediocre, to tell the truth. But this one is spectacular, if only because it has what I love in a soundtrack.... great battle music and great sad tunes, something I feel the Fellowship's soundtrack was lacking.Track 19, Gollum's Song, pretty much makes the whole CD worth buying, if not for just the first 1:15 of the track (which is the main Gollum theme before the added lyrics and harmonizing later in the track). This is the kind of gothic music that I've been waiting on for a long time, something I've expected Danny Elfman to deliver but hasn't in his latest scores."
2,"a mediocre reference, best used in conjunction with other books","i have to say, after compiling a mini library of my own books on herbal health, that this one is the least reliable. the opening bits on basic preparations and a glossery of terms is sure to please people just beginning to explore this world, but i've found the format, and even some of the recommended herbs, to be off base and off putting. it is a fine companion, however, to other books such as ""the herb book,"" and ""the new enclyclopedia of herbs and their uses."" heck, even earl mindell's ""new herb bible"" is a better resource. not good on it's own, but okay to use in conjunction with other books."
2,Suffers from poor vocals,"This CD is a disappointment. Harris Thurmond is a great guitarist, a good songwriter, and a fair vocalist. Unfortunately, he hands most of the vocal duties over to Fia McGann, who is yet another female vocalist who suffers from oversinging syndrome. There are some good songs here, but they are damaged by the vocals."
2,Is it just me...,"Is it just me or did this book not make any sense at all? Okay, I understand homeboy went to jail and got turned out on the down-low, but what was up with the secret society stuff? And did anyone catch the end of the book? The writer needs to rework a lot of scenes. Some stuff just didn't fit together right. It was really hard to follow. The writing was just so juvenile!Didn't anyone read this before it went to print?I ain't hatin, but man--c'mon!"
4,Nice earrings,I like these earrings because they are simple and attractive. I needed some earrings that were blue and am very satisfied with these. They look great with the lapis necklace I bought from Amazon also.
3,Straight Stick Drops and Genuine Blur Lapis Bead Sterling Silver Hook Earrings,"I love the earrings but the straight stick was a little bent when I received them, but I still wear them all the same. I love the style of these earrings!"
2,"Works, but barely",Its really hard to use . You have to use all your strength to jam the cork into the bottle which makes the bottle unstable so it took 2 of us to operate this thing - I held the bottle while my husband corked it. It's extremely difficult and I would not recommend this if you have to cork more than a few bottles at a time.
1,Did nothing for me,"I tried this product with the fertility cleanse kit. I have early stage endo and infertility this was recommended. It did nothing for my symptoms. Same cramps, headaches, and abnormal flow. Oh, well."
1,Awful!,I use these indoors and to communicate with the dock at our lake house. The clarity is so bad that you have to repeat yourself at least 3 times to get even part of your message through to the person on the other end. Do not buy this product!
1,Very disappointing results!,"I followed the instructions very carefully (and I am experienced at gardening too!) and have had very dismal results. Only two seeds (of 8) germinated, and the plants just don't grow!! They are watered, fertilized, receive plenty of sun, and they just stay the same small stunted seedlings of about 1 inch in height. Growth is aganoizingly slow, and I started these baskets in mid-March and it's now the end of May!!I also purchased two kits for hanging baskets of flowers, and they have been almost as disppointing. I expected that after 2 1/2 months I would have full flowering baskets, but they are also small and stunted. The extra seeds that were left over, I planted in a seed tray using my own soil. They are doing very well. Obviously this is a problem with the soil provided in the kits.Never purchase from them again!"
4,Good buy,The watch looked great. I'm just wondering why the manual that came with it was highlighted. New? Makes me think. I hope so. . .
4,Great,It was in great condition it took a little long to get here but was well within the time frame given.
1,What Can I Say?,"Based on some of the reviews here and after trying on my size in a different material, I ordered my preferred style from Amazon. I am on my feet anywhere from 10-6 hours a day and needed something that would hold up better than my regular sneakers. After wearing these to work for a few days I began to realize that they completely failed to support my feet eventually leaving me with the early symptoms of plantar fasciitis. I added a highly recommended orthotic and they became more tolerable but now after less than a month, the color is beginning to come off of the toe area. I am not one who is willing to throw out a pair of $60 shoes but I am more than willing to ask for a refund. If you are looking for something comfortable that supports your feet for long periods of time I would not recommend these shoes."
4,Good reference book.,"Very good reference book. However, the main reason I bought the book is to replace my sunroof motor... you guessed it, no reference on the sunroof motor!"
5,This cd made me a UGK fan!,"This cd was crazy tight! Every song roll! My favorite tracks are 3, 4, 7, and 11. My most favorite is proabably number 3 because Jeezy's my boi. Bun is definitely one of the best souther rappers ever and I can't wait for Pimp C to get out so they can put out another UGK cd. This is one of the best Southern Hip-Hop cds put out in a long time. *OnE LoVe*"
5,I have alwayz loved UGK,"UGK have always been the most unrated duo ever!!!!! With no disrespect to OUTKAST, UGK is the best duo from the South. Their ability to rap over lazy beats while telling stories is truly UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! TRILL made me exhale after a long wait. I have made Greatest Hits CD's that I have mixed and BUN always reps. FACE & UGK should be on EVERYBODY's List of GREATS!!!! Get the CD!!!!"
5,a wonderful gift book for peace lovers,"I don't have this book with me, or I would write a more detailed review, but when I found it had no reviews at all here, I couldn't keep silent. This little book of Pontius Puddle cartoons has many of the classic strips of this series, which appears in several Anabaptist and Quaker magazines. For a preview, go to Joel's Web site. (URLS are not allowed here, so search on ""Pontius' Puddle On-line."") The cartoons are both sweet and sharp, gently prodding readers toward a deeper meditation on peace, nonviolence, evangelism, discipleship, and ... humor."
4,Inspirational fare!,"I'm a huge fan of vicarious wisdom--if you can learn something from others gone before you, why not? The vignettes shared by the celebrities here are poignant, funny, and rich with personal history. The cast of characters Ms. Thomas has managed to line up is impressive and diverse and there's something for everyone. I'm amazed by the breadth of experiences shared and by the different approaches taken in answer to Ms. Thomas' challenge.You can read this book end-to-end or you can leaf through it when you need some inspiration (so far Tom Brokaw's story is my favorite!)."
1,"Great concept, weak result","If the essay writers had followed the concept of rights words at the right time, this would have been dynamite. In reality, only a few did that (and they were the strongest writing); the others rambled on about their philosophy of life, or what they have learned in life, or how they developed. In sum, a big bore."
1,Would not print,"Very disappointing. Purchased and the tape would not print properly. First few letters of label would not print. Upon examination it appeared that the ink tape was broken. So I purchased a new cartridge (twenty bucks), but then the tape would not dispense from the machine. So I returned it and purchased a Brother unit.Stay away from this one. Poor design and.or manufacture!"
4,The cold truth of science,"Riveting chronicles of the Amundsen, Scott expeditions to the Antarctic, with vivid descriptions of the numbing cold, and vicious winds that howl unceasingly over the frozen tundra. The tragedy which befell these brave explorers was magnified in it's effect by their extreme remoteness from any civilization. This was the epitomy of worst case scenarios for exploration of the poles. And one came back! A magnificent tale of tragedy and triumph in the pursuit of knowledge."
4,Older and trusted product,"This is one of the older products on the market for helping dry hair. This is a product that is a quick treatment, and ease of use. It leaves hair soft, shiny, and bouncy. It's a must for the swimming pool, summer dried out hair..."
4,Marie Antoinette Queen of France,"Marie Antoinette was living happily as the Princess of Versailles until her live change. She was sent to France to marry Prince Louis, who was the next heir of France. Dreaming about the live she would have with handsome Prince Loius Marie arrived in France shocked that Prince Louis is ugly but shy.Marie's dream on becoming a Queen did come true. At the moment King Loius XV died, Marie Antoinete and her husband was crowned King And Queen. Marie Antoinette loved jewelry and clothes. She bought gowns and had parties but doeesn't relised the amount of money she uses."
4,A Wonderful Guide to the Personal Life of Marie Antoinette,This book is the key to the personal life of the Princess who became Queen of Versailes and messed up France by ignoring her people. I t is a must read for readers of all ages!
5,A Terrific Historical Book For Young People,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book about Marie Antoinette. It is so important for young people to learn about history, and Ms. Lasky does an excellent job. While reading the story, I felt that I was right there at that time. The characters were alive and exciting, and the ""diary"" was a definite page turner. I highly recommend this book for leisure or classroom reading."
2,No results yet,Been on this for months and notice no results yet. Perhaps it takes longer; perhaps not effective for me. Very disappointed.
1,I did not like it.,"A co-worker of mine went to Jamaica for vacation in Feb. and bought me a 1lb. bag of the ground. It's expiration date was March. I brewed it as soon as I got home. To me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week. I wonder if it was due to the expiration date, or does this coffee really taste like this. If so, I will never buy again. From all the hype, I was expecting much more."
4,Very good for realistic prices,This book is great for realistic market prices. It has two price listings one for good condition and one for excellent for Postwar and Prewar and excellent and new for everything after 1969. Every listing is in numeric order with era it was made and even list special club cars but no prices
3,"The Amazing Adventure, Cary Grant","One of Cary Grant's early movies, it's ok. Also starring katherive Hepburn. Anything with Cary Grant is good. This movie isn't usually seen on television so having it in your dvd collection is a treat."
3,A movie of its time,"I enjoyed this movie. It's Cary Grant, after all! The plot was predictable, the sound was sometimes difficult to distinguish, and it was often unrealistic. However, I still enjoyed watching it, mostly to see a bit of the 1930s, with the cars, clothes, and styles. It has a great fight scene that is so staged it's fantastic. For under $10, if you like old movies, this one is worth seeing."
2,"He's a GREAT actor, but this is a HORRIBLE movie.","As an actor, he is my favorite, but this movie is AWFUL. The only thing AMAZING about it is CARY (and thank goodness it's ONLY 62 minutes long). The story behind it is interesting, and it could have been a MUCH better movie with the right director. Cary did his best with what material he had, but I do NOT recommend it (unless you play it on MUTE and just gaze at him)."
2,Mariah Loves Rock,"The item arrived in a timely manner but the book was more well-worn than I anticipated.I think the vendor should have described the book's condition more clearly. However, despite thisworn condition, I was happy to find a copy of this out-of-print book."
4,"Excellent seat, but should have higher harnessed weight limit!","We have two of these car seats and really like them. We found the instruction manuals a bit hard to follow, but we got it right (eventually). They are easy to load in and out of and I like the wings that can help keep their heads from rolling around when they are sleeping. My one problem that I realized pretty late in the game is that we need a car seat with a higher harnessed weight limit. This one only goes to 40 lb. harnessed....that meant nothing to me with my newborn, but now with my 36 lb. two-year old I have figured out that this seat isn't going to take him all the way. He obviously can't go into a booster any time soon! So we are now buying another car seat. The Graco Platinum Cargo (up to 48 lb. harnessed) or the Britax Marathon (up to 65 lb. harnessed). Just a thought for those of you with larger kids (DS is in the 97th percentile for weight and height)."
1,Terrible car seat,"We absolutely don't like this car seat. Firstly, it is very difficult to install and when we had to take the cover off to clean it, it was like taking apart some complex puzzle that had no instructions. Even the instruction guide was difficult to follow. Luckily my husband had ordered an Evenflow Tribute Deluxe Convertible car seat and after putting that back in the car, we wouldn't even think of trying to use this one again. I regret the 130.00 that we wasted on it. Terrible! Don't waste your money."
3,first time parent,"This car seat is really nice, however the directions are hard to follow. I have a 2005 Honda Accord and it is hard to turn the car seat rear facing and still have room. I haven't actually got it installed the way I want it to be. I am gonna go to the state partol to let them install it the way it should be. This would be a good car seat for someone who has an SUV with a lot of room."
1,Don't waste your time.,"A much better title for this book would have been ""Interesting Financial Concepts That Hopefully Some Other Book Will Teach You""As an engineer, I saw this as a very shallow treatment of Chaos Theory that will do NOTHING for those who actually wish to apply it to financial markets. Chapter after chapter poses questions to the reader but fails do deliver the answers. One can only assume that the few diagrams and examples presented are not explained because the author just does not fully understand them.The reviewer who claims that the book was a good starting point may have been partially right. It asks so many questions that now I must find a text with at least one or two answers."
5,Excellent base for developing profitable market strategies.,"Apparently a book's value is in the eyes of the beholder. The Oregonian writer of the negative comments about the Chorafas book reached a far different conclusion than I did. I think that person must have been looking for an elementary cookbook that would make him rich by following a few simple rules and not having any work to do. Personally, the Chorafas book was exactly the launching point I needed, and I used my engineering background to develop Chorafas' concepts and apply them directly to the stock market, and I am making a lot of money."
1,Terrific Movie - DVD [is bad].,"There's nothing special about this DVD. Nothing extra, nothing but the movie. Don't waste your money on it. Instead, wait for the special edition that's bound to come out in the months ahead that'll have everything this doesn't."
1,I'd be embarrassed to have my name on something like this,"I feel sorry for Muhammed Ali. It must be tough being a charismatic, interesting person, and having your life displayed in such a terrible fashion as this movie presents. I get the feeling most critics really wanted to like this movie going in, and were afraid to talk about how bad it really was. It opens with an incredibly boring ten minute musical, and progresses to get even worse. If you can stomach more than 30 minutes of this travesty, you're more of a masochist than I."
3,Too slow,"I was fairly entertained during parts of the movie, but overall it moves quite slowly and I found myself checking how many minutes had passed (in order to calculate how many there were left!) I agree with those who wrote that it is a very difficult task to try to create a biopic about a man with so many different sides, which separates him a bit from other African-American leaders of his time (Malcolm X, MLK). There's not just his boxing, but also his religious affiliations, his issues with the US government, his womanizing, his relationship with the press (Howard Cosell), etc etc. Will Smith does a pretty good job, but he didn't have much to work with. For learning about Ali, I would recommend ""When We Were Kings."" Unless you're 14 and want to get jiggy wid' Will Smith. A lot of the movie could have been cut."
2,"Uh, what happened?...","I think Michael Mann forgot to have something happen in this movie. This film is about 120 minutes of slow-motion training shots, 20 minutes of actual boxing and 20 minutes of actual story. Muhammad Ali is an interesting person with a fascinating story, so why only tell part of it? Why stop after he returns to the ring? You've given the movie no real ending or closure. Aside from this, the performances are great. Will Smith is at his best as Ali and John Voight is wonderful as Cosell. I just wish there was more fist in ""Ali's"" punch."
3,"Entertaining movie, Terrible DVD","Michael Mann take on the enviable task of covering the life of one of most colorful characters of this century. There simply have been simply too many noteworthy events in Ali's life to get through all of it in 2 hours. I for one am glad that Mann and company attempted the impossible. This story was too important to have never been told. The DVD is an entirly different story however. There is no excuse to leave all of the extras off of the DVD version! I'm that this is simply a ploy by Sony to generate double sales for this movie. One for the release version and then a ""directors cut"" extended version!"
2,Does not meet lofty expectations,"After reading and hearing so many good reviews about this movie I found myself disappointed at the end of it. Will Smith doesn't even try to remotely sound like Ali, and comes off as very flat. Everything ""learned"" about Ali in the movie is nothing new unless your very young or have been living in a cave for the past 40 years. Also, it is diffult to believe that Smith would really stand a chance against the actors who played Liston, Foreman, Fraiser, or even Chuck Wepner. As for positives, Jamie Foxx steals every scene he's in as Drew ""Bundini"" Brown; but that's about it."
2,Not that impressive.,"Aside from a few wonderful performances by supporting players (that warranted the 2 star rating), namely John Voight, Jamie Foxx and Mario Van Peebles, this is a very boring flick. The film is too long and the cuts are way too quick in a lot of instances. But, isn't that the case of the movies nowadays. Everything is filmed and edited like a music video these days. Just cause that kind of thing works on television doesn't mean an audience wants to sit though that much assault on the senses. Plus Will Smith was the same variation on almost every character he plays except with a bad Ali impersonation."
1,Awful,"I have not walked out of a movie since ""Time Bandits"". This one was awful- I had no interest in how it ended- Will Smith was fair but the story lacked substance. What a a disappointment."
3,Ali swings and misses!!,"Michael Mann's direction of the movie is all over the place. The story doesn't give the whole story. What about his beginnings in Louisville, Kentucky? What was his motivation for joining the Nation of Islam? Who are these women in Ali's life? Don't get me wrong. The performances were the best thing in this movie. Preferrably from Will Smith, Jon Voight and Jamie Foxx. You should be more inclinded to see the movie ""The Greatest"" which shows Muhammad Ali as himself. And even though the champis stiff as an actor, the story is better represented."
2,"Uninspiring And Over-the-hill ""Preachy""",Let me tell you that I know my bit about Cassius Clay and what he stood for. This movie has little or no entertainment value.Will Smith probably made a good Ali but to be true I thought he was boring and loud at all the wrong times.There's a fiest of bad actors in this movie and there's nothing really to talk about.I'm a Will Smith fan but this movie only made me a little confused with what I saw.It gets a bit too political somewhere in the middle and the final result of it is an overly preachy film.Watch it if you told yourself you had to do so.Don't buy it.Buy cheap bubble game but avoid buying at all costs or situations.P.S - I can't recall one scene I enjoyed in this film except the last fight scene(climax if you may call it that)
5,One of the best movies !,For a brief moment I forgot that its Wills Smith and not Ali. I don't think any more justice could have been done. A fabulous movie with great photography and music. Need to see to believe it !
5,Great Read!,"This book was awesome! I love all the elements it has, romance, action, mystery and an interesting group of characters. I highly recommend it! Can't wait to read more Pamela Clare books."
5,Macabre Gem,"Salome is a play based on the bibical story of the beheading of John the Baptist. As the story opens, Salome becomes fascinated by this man of God, and the fascination quickly devolves into lust. She desires John and does her best to tempt him. However, John doesn't give in and he holds onto his faith. With each rejection, she becomes angrier and angrier. In the end, she is driven to bloodlust, and orders for the head of John the Baptist.The language of this play is beautiful to read and highly poetic. This is one of the best plays for reading. Of course you can draw your own conclusions as to the relationship between lust and bloodlust. False passions lead to bad ends."
4,NICE EXTRA FOR THE PARTY!,"I USED THIS AS A ""PROP"" AT MY MOTHER'S 68TH BIRTHDAY PARTY. IT ADDED A NICE TOUCH TO THE TABLE. THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF CANDY IN THE BOX, AND I THINK IT BROUGHT A LOT OF NOSTALGIA TO THE OCCASION."
3,Retro candy,"Well, the thought is really cool and I thought it would be a great gift, but as someone else stated, it is not very much candy for the price. If you want something similar, Cracker Barrel has one much cheaper."
5,Great remix,this is a great remix of one of the best records of the year. forget the haters!!!!!!!!!
1,"I may be a ""hater"" but at least I have taste","As if Haunted Cities wasn't mediocre enough, they have to get some no-talent DJ to remix this garbage. Tim Armstrong, exactly at what point did we lose you? Save your money."
3,Smaller than expected.,"A tight fit for my Canon Powershot SX100, I felt the velcro would have been better on the camera compartment, and the zipper on the accessory pocket. The orange version gets dirty quickly."
3,"OK, a little awkward to use. Very compact","This allows you to stack downward five blouses or shirts in the space of one hanger. It's ok, but by the time you have five staggered downward, it's pretty deep and might drag the floor or drag a lower rack in your closet. they also make a somewhat more expensive (per shirt) set of three hangers which are independent but ""hook"" onto one another to hang downward in a set. I found that approach less taxing and also saves space. Besides just saving space, the visual organization (3 or 4 white shirts together, 3 or 4 blue shirts together, and STAY together) is helpful for me."
2,Where's the art?,"I really hate art books that are all writing, too few images, and this is a classic one of those. Prof. Elger waxes on (and on) about the meaning of the paintings but talks so little about formalistic issues (he is obiviously not a painter nor cares much about the art of painting). I suppose what he says is of interest to some, but as an artist I cared very little for the book."
5,Great Show!,"I love this show! it's so entertaining and is funny if you appreciate British humor which seems to be a bit drier. I was so sad when they stopped playing this on pbs, and years later I found that I wanted to re-watch the series. It's a great story and family friendly. The quality of the video is good, but I wish they had designed the menu differently. It seems a bit awkward at first, but you get used to it quickly."
3,Good Job,You wacky Yanks! I am a midget( 4 foot 2) and I got a dead leg in the face trying to understand this. Over in Britain it's called the Good Life and we like to watch it when there's nothing else on.Thank you very much Amazon!
4,A Good Presentation,"I hadn't seen this series in decades and remembered it as being very funny; I'm a huge fan of anything with Penelope Keith. In this series about a suburban couple going self-sufficient, Ms. Keith plays Margo, their snobbish neighbor.I have to admit that after one of the DVD's, the basic premise for the series started getting stale. Could just be me, but they seemed to stretch the series out for too many episodes.However, it is amusing, and it's a good price. Video quality is good to excellent."
4,Nice colander,This is a great colander with one issue...there always seems to be a bit of water that collects on the edges at the bottom. There should be holes there too! But I use it all the time to wash veggies etc. and I love that I can hook it onto the sink and drain my pasta directly into the sink without it sitting in the sink water.
2,Do Not Be Fooled,"Please be aware that this is not a BOOK, but a little pamphlet, as I discovered after paying almost $6 including shipping. This is NOT the BOOK ""How To Know God's Will"" by Charles Stanley. Do not be misled and buy this pamphlet unless that is specifically what you are looking for."
1,Based On Bad Reasoning / Logic,"This book (as you can see from the excerpt) is condensed book (small enough to be a pamphlet) based on the How to Listen to God book which was also by him, which I reviewed. I found the How to Listen to God to be full of errors and bad reasoning which I listed in my review. Go check to see what I said before rating this review unhelpful."
3,Pretty Good,"Not bad. I am learning a lot by reading this book, cannot say I believe every word, but most of the stuff is good."
1,Terrible,"Don't waste your time any further. Save yourself time, money, and mental energy by looking elsewhere for self-help.PLEASE, do not buy this book."
3,Worth a quick read,"The author presents some practical advice as to how we should alter our thinking if we wish to press on in the face of life's obstacles. You can breeze over the portions of the book that attempt to validate the author's life's work and get the gist of it all by taking the cosmo quiz that he provides so you can assess your own ""explanatory style"" and then reading the chapters on sports and politics."
1,Never mind,"There is no point in buying this book. It won't work and it will just be a jumbled mess of words on paper. And you know what else? It's not available on the Kindle, and probably never will be."
4,"Gave copies to my brother, sister & several friends","I am like a former smoker. I realize how destructive my negative thinking was. No dreamy platitudes in this book, just practical guidance to help change your pattern of thinking. I used to say ""I am a realist"", when I was actually an unhappy pessimist. I look at life quiet differently now, I am able to accomplish more and are viewed as a much more enjoyable person to be around. I discovered that the cause of my unhappiness was internal, not external. Now when I see negative people I think 'if they only knew how happy they could be'."
4,Interesting and for me a challenging book.,"I'm trying to learn to be ore optimistic more often.I have young kids and don't feel to happy about the future of the world being created for them by me, my parents, grandparents and on.I am finding the book useful but as yet it has not helped me overcome my increasing pessimism.Maybe I'm asking too much."
3,Good book,"I choose this book to use in my classroom, it is a good book, not a great book. However, my students do seem to like parts of it."
5,"Science-based, scholarly results for the record.","So far I read the first half of this wonderful book. Dr. Seligman is a samaritan, helping me to get out of my helplessness and depression. The book reads like a thriller, far from monotonous. More comments later on. Blessings for you, Martin."
3,Psychological insights into optimism,"I found this book to have some good insights into the examination of the ""why"" people choose to be optimistic or not.On a more practical level of personal transformation, I highly recommend a book called ""Working On Yourself Doesn't Work"" by Ariel and Shya Kane.For me The Kanes' book presents a humorous and enlightening way of looking at ""how"" and not ""why"" I operated in ways that did not faciliate my life being as great as it now. After attending many of the Kanes' seminars, listening to their great audio tapes, such as Magical Relationships, my life has become humorous and enlightened in ways I never thought possible."
2,Still a pessimist...,"I'm not dismissing this book altogether - it has some points of interest, but I fail to see how the findings of Dr. Seligman and others are as original or groundbreaking as he suggests. Too much of the book is devoted to descriptions of research methodology, various anecdotes and praise for colleagues. The few chapters on actually learning optimism amount to some rather generic techniques for keeping the right perspective and avoiding the negative. The fact of the matter is that we often lose sight of a few simple truths in life. It's more helpful to have them articulated to us in a way that resonates than to read about experimental design, who deserves credit for what and the science behind the obvious."
3,Gratitude Forgotten here to Improve Optimism! :o(,"Nice book. Author could have summarized his 3 focus points in 1 paragraph, instead of an entire book. He enjoys hearing himself talk & constantly repeats his self-discovered mantra that Depression grows when we see our problems as permanent, all-encompassing and personal. Unfortunately, Gratitude was never discussed as a reason to be optimistic. If its learned optimism.. then included must be learned gratitude!! We as a nation are so into our own lives that we take for granted EVERYTHING we have and want more and more. Nothing satisfies!! If we learned gratitude and were truly thankful for what we have been given there would be far less depression and negativity. Instead, we are programmed consumers and are market programmed Never to be satisfied. Without Hope and Gratitude, there is no optimism."
5,Don't Be Pessimistic: Buy It,"I jumped to the last three chapters with the exercises and was blown away by ease and effectiveness of Seligman's system. I thought there was no reason to read the rest of the book. Wrong. This is a fascinating, rigorous, and remarkably practical book that provides simple, easy-to-remember tools for raising one's level of optimism for life. Can't work for you? People always say that? It never works that way? Sounds like you need to read the book..."
2,It was ok,It was ok but nothing like what i was expecting. Wish it had better recipes and more photos of finished dishes
5,"I'm Italian, and this book, WOW","Wow was I amazed. I'm italian and have never seen a true italian cookbook. Whats contained in here are things strictly only italian families from New York would have. If you have been to olive garden, and 99% of other italian italian restaurants you never had real italian food. Get this book, make some real italian food, and you'll never be able to eat at any italian restaurant unless its in New York area after this."
1,Not the book pictured!,"I purchased this book because I missplaced my copy. I thought that I was purchasing the exact book shown, which I believe is the 2003 version. Unfortunately, I did not receive the book pictured. Instead I received an earlier version of this book. I needed the version pictured because I wanted to start the Curves weight loss program that is outlined in that edition. Unfortunately, the book I received does not include that information. Disappointed!"
5,Great strapless,I really like this strapless bra. It stays up like it's supposed to. The fit is very comfortable. I love the option of convertible straps. It gives you so many more options.
3,tooo small,"Bought this on another site because they were having a sale and I'd recently gotten a different maidenform that I loved... I ordered the same size as that bra and it was way too small in the cups (band was ok).It seems like it'd be a great bra in the right cup size, so ladies, consider ordering one cup from your usual."
2,broke on first use,The 30 caliber slotted end piece broke after about 5 swipes down the barral . Made of plastic ?Just not strong enough for intended use .
4,Fresh new look at a funny operetta!,This is an extremely entertaining performance. All the characters are wonderful and so right for their roles. My only complaint is they shortened Frosh's role to next to nothing and I've always enjoyed the actor who gives a new interpretation to this wonderfully comic role. It has been updated with beautiful costumes and a trememdous revolving set which is a subtle suggestion of a jail all the way through the opera. I think almost anyone would enjoy this beautiful and clever production.
5,4 1/2 stars - Truly Bizarre!,"WOW! This is a truly bizzare film. There are a lot of genres here including romance, sci-fi and mystery... Tom Cruise and all of the co-stars including Cruz, Cameron, Russell and Mewes are excellent. The use of music in this film is so bizarre, but it really works and the choice in music is great for this type of film (Wait for ""Good Vibrations""). If you like David Lynch type films, you'll definitely enjoy this. Also, if you enjoyed films like ""Lost In Translation"", ""What Dreams May Come"", ""Memento"" or ""Fight Club"", you should definitely invest the over two hours it takes to watch this film. This one is a truly original ride!"
2,"Too long for a such an obvious, cheap gimmick","I was bored out of my skull watching this pretentious ""thriller"". I'm a fan of Tom Cruise, but his character, and most of the other cardboard cut-outs, were so shallow that I didn't care for anyone in the film. I realize Cameron Crowe thinks he's God's gift to filmmaking, but his work in this film is very conservative and transparent. I hope someone gives him a better script next time. I figured out the ending less than an hour into the film and had to suffer through another 75 minutes until the big reveal. My advice is to save your time and money and let a friend tell you the story in 30 seconds, which is all it takes to explain. Just because a film is visually stunning, doesn't mean it's good."
1,Complete torture,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I paid to see this in the theater and I want my eight dollars back. The story is so confusing that after the first hour, I didn't care what happened anymore and what I don't understand is where are all these good reviews on this website coming from? ""Rotten Tomatoes"" has dozens of reviews for for the film online and cumilatively, the film scored a 39 out of a possible 100. Thats disasterous for a film made by a major director."
1,Review,This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I could not understand anything. Every character is crazy or going to be crazy.A complete waste of money and time.
2,you guys are morons,"This movie is not that great, takes over 2 hours to get to anything. its just a dream that he lives through, talk about predictable. go rent another movie."
2,Is there any point to c this movie if it is not for Cruise?,"If you are a Cruise fan, you will be disappointed by this one. Half of the movie he has been put on a mask. The plot is confusing and at the last part it turned from a romantic psychothriller into science fiction, it just doen't wash. The characters are so typical hollywood types I hardly can have any empathy with them. If you are not a Cruise fan, simply skip it. I would rather recommend ""The Game"" over this one."
1,AWFUL !,"If they had tried to make it this bad, they simply wouldn't have suceeded. It's hard to believe that with the talent involved , they would come up with such a terrible movie. Do yourself a favor and get one of Cameron Crowe's good works (of which there are many) instead !"
2,Very strange and disjointed...,"I really wanted to enjoy this film, but it was so poorly made and the plot was so hectic that I truly had trouble following it in any meaningful way. By the time they let you in on the real meaning, so much time has passed that you are just wanting the thing to end. The director seemed to have trouble deciding what this movie should be when it grew up. He finally settled on ""shattered"", which could have easily been the title of this movie.P.S. I give it two stars because Tom Cruise was excellent in his part."
1,Fall from the sky,"It takes only ten minutes to understand this movie is going nowhere. I didn't see the Spanish original so my review is only about this version.Safe for the starting sequence, shot in a tremendous deserted Times Square, everything from then on is just pretentious, trying to mean a lot and eventually failing to say anything.Bad script, mediocre acting, very good soundtrack though. But it's really not enough."
5,WOW!,"I heard and read many bad opinions and reviews about this movie, therefore when I saw it (4 years after the original release) I had very low expectations. WOW, this is one of the most intriguing mind bending movies I have ever seen. Absolutely awesome and that is all I have to say!"
2,A proof - money cann't buy the talant !,"At the beginning I thought ... it will get better . In the middle I wanted to turn it off . At the end I thought ... I should've turned it off .Here is a rich guy , struggling , fighting the board of very bad directors . They are trying to take a few bucks away from him . I was already crying ... What a conflict ! You had a few billions ... now you are going to have a few less??? No food on the table for the kids which you never had ! What a tragedy !?It fills like to me - a bunch of rich people desided to produse a movie . They paied good money ... they hire other guys to... didn't work ! I gess , money cann't buy everything in this world ... espesially talant ... or LOVE .Story is too fake , no matrix-II for this guys . Not smart at all . Fake and rich idiot sended us a massage : I have no massage at all !..."
3,Just OK,Not as bad as some would like you to believe - but definitely not epic as others would have you believe. Just OK
4,Yet another unacknowledged Philip K. Dick movie,"This movie is visually stunning and emotionally compelling. There are sublime moments of disconcerting, almost ridiculous humor throughout the film. More importantly, the film broaches interesting epistemic questions about what counts as real and why perhaps reality must be shared to be meaningful.I'm mostly writing this review to encourage anyone who liked this movie to look into the stories of Philip K. Dick. Vanilla Sky has significant parallels to his haunting story ""I hope I shall arrive soon."" PKD also interjects delightful, irreverent incongruities into stories that would otherwise be heavy with metaphysical musings. This technique, too, seems to have been lifted in Vanilla Sky.The more PKD you read, the more you will see his pervasive influence on today's ""arthouse"" aesthetic."
2,Art movie?,"This was a huge disappointment. I cannot imagine what possessed Cruise to get involved in a film with such a confusing plot. Besides that, the characters of both the Diaz and Cruz ladies irritated me no end. I want to be entertained and this effort was just too much hard work, in fact it completely drained me. Some scenes are quite artfully filmed though. This is strictly for those people who want to be challenged by the movies that they see, and perhaps for lovers of so-called European Art Movies."
5,Splendid.,"I loved this movie. Great acting, great story. Some people might be disappointed if they were expecting a normal romance/drama and don't like the sci-fi turns."
1,Vanilla Mistake,Don't bother with this empty star vehicle. Too much nonsense to wade through for a weak finish. But if you like unrealistic witty banter this may be ok for you. See the original Abre Los Ojos for a real quality film.
2,What Were They Thinking,"Ok, so Tom Cruise is looking for new ways to spread his wings. He wants us to know he's an ACTOR. I like his work, but here he's so busy ACTING, he constantly upstages himself. As for Penelpe Cruz, she was better in the original foreign film version of this film"
1,Like a David Lynch Imitation Gone Horribly Wrong,"I was also expecting good things from this film. Having seen both David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE and the trailer for this, I was expecting something good and more or less uncommon.This film, however, turned out to be a surreal film for the people that whined ""I don't get it"" halfway through MULHOLLAND DRIVE. (By the way, whether you do or don't understand the plot doesn't have to be an essential criterion for enjoying a film. Try abstract animation.)This film's cheap sci-fi explanation at the end looks like it was trying to pull from THE MATRIX, but instead settled for technological explanation pulled from an airport sci-fi novel.And neither the directing, acting, nor set/costume design make up for any of this."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This has to be one of the most awful, convoluted and bizarre films that I have ever seen in my entire life! While I really respect Cameron Crowe (""Almost Famous"") I really have to wonder what in the world happened to him to direct such a terrible film. You watch this movie and none of it rings true and none of it makes any sense: from the central character played by Tom Cruise to the storyline or even the main theme or plot of the whole enterprise. First it's a conventional story which turns into a mystery that becomes a thriller that's really a sci-fi - and none of it's any good and none of the pieces even fit together. Don't waste your time watching this. Find something else to watch or read a good book."
1,Sickening.,"Vanilla Sky directed by Cameron Crowe is such a disaster. I can't tell you how much I hated this film. Cameron Diaz is terribly cast, her performance is so hyper and foolish, I just wanted to slap her. Penelope Cruz is so hard to understand, she needs to take some speech classes, and Tom Cruise thinks he is the best actor that ever existed, he's not by the way. Couldn't believe Cameron Crowe could write and direct such an uneven, confusing, and boring story. This is one film to avoid, even the Paul McCartney song is awful and I love him."
2,What is goin on?,"This movie, in my opinion, is the most confusing movie I have ever saw. It is not even realistic, it's like a fantasy world. Very stupid movie...unless you enjoy seeing Penelope Cruz topless or hearing Cameron Diaz having an orgasm. Those are the only good parts in the movie."
2,Dazed and confused,"This film does not know what it wants to be. It is a convoluted mess of Sci-Fi, psychological drama, fantasy, love story and drama. It combines this mess with the look of an art film.The movie is 2 1/2 hours long. It moves along at a slow agonizing speed. The ending is predictable less than an hour into the film. The rest of the film is series of dream-like flash backs. The principal characters played by Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz are so flat and dull, you simply don't care for any of them.This a big budget disaster. Skip this one!!!"
2,Depressing and predictable,"The characters are cliched, the plot is obvious but Karl Geary is gorgeous and a fine actor (as usual)."
3,Enchanted Barn,THE SPELLING IN THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE! I HAVE NEVER EVER READ A BOOK THAT HAD SO MANY TYPING ERRORS. I FOUND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO READ BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY ERRORS BUT FOUND THE BOOK WAS INTERESTING.
3,The enchanted barn,Good story but too lengthy. One of those books you can't just pick up and read right thru. You need several days to complete it.
2,Some components damaged,"Although it is difficult to determine the effectivness of this product in terms of confirming any actual horsepower increase as opposed to the manufarturer's claims, my basis for evaluating this product stems from the condition in which it was received. Packaged as new, it was revealed that the rubber tubing used to connect the K&N filter to the housing was split. I had to use one of my own hose clamps to secure these two components as the clamp supplied was undersized. In retrospect, it appears that some other customer in attempting to assemble this rubber tubing had to split it in order to attach it as this too was undersized. The metal bracket used to secure the assembled kit to the front of the engine compartment was distorted as well. It was an absolute nightmare attempting to install this product."
5,"So far, so good","The assembly of this mower was tool-less and easy. The blades are sharp and effective. After using it once I give it five stars. Because I live near salt water, I intend to follow the manufacturer's suggestion to spray the blades and moving parts with a lubricating oil after each use to prevent rust and to keep the blades sharp."
5,Great Service,Recieved item promptly. It was just what I needed to do my work. Service and product was good. Seems like it will hold up for a long period of time.
1,product or sound,they rock but the sound is not really better then any other formatt- this isnt worth the exra money the sound may actually be better on a normal cd.
3,"""Just another plastic pick""","Nothing special, just another plastic pick. Not bad, not outstanding. Just an average run of the mill plastic pick."
3,Item different than pictured,"I bought a dozen of these off amazon last week (jan 20) and when they arrived, they are different than the ones pictured.Although the picks are black, they are patterned randomly with silver/grey wavy lines (as if reflective paper were crinkled up, and then sealed/pressed into the outline of a pick).Additionally, the picks have ""Musician's Friend"" labeled in silver on one side.From a distance in the right light, they do look very dark/black.They perform well though, and they were definitely cheap...Just be sure you know what you're buying."
3,that music fan is stuck up artsy loser,"hey pal you say ""berklee"" like its actually worth something.... i think youre confused- cause its worth nothing... maybe if you had a brain in that inflated head of yours, you could get into a real BERKELEY and actually go somewhere you can actually be proud of. oh yeah and there's only CAL and its in Berkeley- not LA, not SF... BERKELEY."
1,club music,"One star cause it doesn't have the songs I'm looking for, great movie though. thanks to those you posted where the club scene songs can be found, but where can we get the actual mix that was played while Naturelle and Marie were dancing? That is not on the CDs mentioned below...."
2,No scent,I bought these for my home and they have no lavendar scent to them at all. Waste of money and effort. Would not order again.
5,outstanding!,"Arana's CD is great. Her voice is uplifting and angelic. I can not wait for her next album. Who ever reads this should definitly buy this album, especially if your looking for good Latin music.best,Mr. Parkes esq."
4,Masonic Silence was Exploited by the Right,"Richard Thorn's book presents what amounts to the party line from Masonry. He was both diplomatic and polite to the religious right - something worthy of praise.It is sad that, in the name of their G_d, the religious right can 'bear false witness against their neighbor.' Fortunately the secular society in which we live - there being a wall of seperation between church and state - allows BOTH thinking and believing to exist in the same communities."
3,oddy familiar,"While the premise of this book is laudable, and Rev. Carlson deserves every slap on the hand he gets for his many prevarications in the name of God, Mr. Thorn's book is nearly identical to an earlier book by A. DeHoyos, ""The Cloud of Prejudice."" Interested parties should get both books and judge for themselves whether Mr. Thorn has acted questionably."
5,Outstanding EDC!,"After having recieved my first Spyderco for Father's Day last year, the Endura w/Emerson Wave, I've been hooked on Spyderco blades. Absolutely love the Endura, reason I also own the combo varity of it but I'm not always in the mood to carry a 4"" blade and so I searched around and though I'm also a Cold Steel fan, Spyderco won again. I'd considered the G-10 handle but weight was something I wanted to keep at a minimum so I went w/the FRN handles and will say I'm extremely pleased w/the decision at 3.2 ozs sometimes I even forget its clipped to my pocket. Serrated portion cuts like a chainsaw, and the straight edge is as sharp as a razor. Its become my primary EDC, I like it that much. Show it off quite often and the response is always positive, very impressive lil guy, definately worth the purchase."
2,Does not fit all heads.,This does not stretch much. Could not get it on my head. It is so tight. I can't use the one I opened and will return the second one.
3,Does not look like the US Capitol!,"This is a lovely block set, durable and fun.... but I rated it low on educational value because it does NOT look like the US Capitol building. My husband and I live and work downtown Washington DC, just blocks from the actual building, and we both agree: this is a poor representation of the Capitol building. Too bad!"
4,Fun Italian-American Fact Book,"Bravo! I have been waiting a long time for a book like this. A work that should be in every Italian-American home. Chock full of facts and fun from Da Vinci to Valentino, from Galiilei to Zappa. Addicting!"
4,Herb & Joe Are Good!,"Herb Ellis And Joe Pass do wonderful jobs each soloing and complementing each other. They have some great songs, and solos as well, though at times it is hard to distinguish between who is playing what. However, their styles and their tone change contribute to us knowing who is playing. This is Seven Come Eleven with another cd, however, it is not hybrid. The solos are great. Unfortunately there is not a song player set up here yet, but I assure you this is worth your money if you like trio jazz kind of stuff. It takes a while to get used to but its great.P.S Please Check Out My Other Reviews!"
2,"Machining is not precise, some of the bits don't work",This product would be perfect if the machining was precise. Some of the bits/wrenches have the center security hole drilled offset. In other words the center hole was not aligned so you can't actually use the tool on security torx screws. Good thing I bought another similar set that was more precisely machined.
2,Stopped working after one month,"When this was working, this was an ok player. It's light and the controls are average- although not the most intuitive. However, it stopped working a couple months after I got it! Very frustrating, especially when you pay $79 and there is nothing you can do to get your money back. To be fair, I did drop it ONCE, but it worked fine afterwards. Two weeks later, it stopped powering up."
4,"Great unit, but needs a driver update!","This is a great MP3 unit and it is living up to all the great reviews I read about it before I purchased it. Great sound in a small package, and it is really simple to use. Here is the catch....You will need to look for the firmware update ""PlayCenter3_02_52.exe"". Why? The firmware that comes with the player is not updated, it is version 2.52.18-Retail, and it wont copy music, etc to the player unless it is version 2.8 or greater. This downloadable driver does the trick, but someone should have given us a heads-up."
2,Try it before you buy it,I had envisioned the 4 hour voice record time as perfect for my classes. The microphone has extremely poor pickup quality and you have to speak directly into it to pick anything up. There is no provision for an external mic. The instructions are extremely brief and poorly written and left out steps. I had to go to customer service via email to find out how to record. Creative Labs customer service was very good and responded rapidly. I am sticking with my $30 microcassette recorder.
4,Good Unit Bad Weak Software,"Have had this unit for a couple years. Also have a 3rd gen 15 gb iPod. Size and weight are major pluses. With expansion card over two hours music. No hard drive, no skips.The Creative software is poor. I really dislike it. I have to have the original cd just to get the most recent versions. Go to Red Chair Software and get Notmad software which is Windows Explorer like. Very nice and fast compared the Creative's.One AA battery is very nice.For a quick music fix get the Nomad."
4,Lots to like about the Nomad,II(c) 128MBLikesSmall - REALLY shirtpocket sizedEasily (down/up)load with provided software (get the updates!)Great sound and headphonesFits easily on my motorcycle and plugs into its audio systemDislikesNavigating the downloaded tracks - one @ a time is it.Documentation for inserting SmartMedia is totally missing
4,better than most,"good things:1. ease of use2. no skip4. ez to use software w/ usb support for fast transfer between computer and player5. ease of usebad things:1.not enough space even w/ extended memory2. when naming w/ artist, album and song they dont show all only 12 characters3. when plyaing music you are unable to view clock4. doesnt come with ac adater to recharge5. have to buy carrying case!"
3,F Y I,"Great stuff as stated below. Here are a few problems.-No AC plug in to recharge batteries-Not USB powered (you use batteries when you up/download)-The recording quality is not the best. Alot of background noise.. that's a real bummer. To get clarity you have to be close.Creative Labs, why in the world did you not make a LINE IN? and why did you put the tiny microphone on the front of the machine?Hmmm. Something to think about."
2,Not for runners,"The player has sufficient memory, convenient software, and useful features - especially the bass/treble and line-out. However, if you sweat while working out or running, this is not the player for you. It keeps shutting down. Then you have to take out the battery and hold down the button until it reboots; definitely annoying while on a run. The belt clip does not secure it well, and it will fall on the ground if you bounce around. And carry an extra battery, it's a bit power hungry. Customer service was fine and the memory upgrade gives you plenty of songs for 3-4 hours.If they make it water-resistant, include a good AM/FM tuner, supply decent headphones (the supplied earbuds always fall out), and ensure it clips on securely, this would be a great, great unit. It was a gift, so I can't complain too loudly."
3,Works Great,"Simple item that works great. Just be aware that item you are buying dosn't have quality brass fittings like shown in the picture, but plastic fittings."
1,some books should be dropped in the trash at once,"This book is not worth the money you spend on it, there are so many other books on making home pages out there, which is worth much more than you pay....and they includes so much more than this does. Why go for the second best?"
2,Okay condition but not like new.,There was a note that his book was like new but the front and back pages were all bent. The inside of the pages looked okay but it is not what I would consider like new as advertised.
3,definitely a step up,"(december 4, 2010) definitely a step up from my cheapo walmart speakers with a hole in the subwoofer. These sound wonderful, with great mids and lovely highs. I do sort of wish i had a sub though. And maybe its just my electric wiring, but there's a slight buzz at higher volumes, and they always ""pop"" when i turn the ceiling fan off in the room. Having two inputs is certainly a plus, as well as having a headphone output.*Edit* March 21, 2011. At higher volumes, or with the bass turned up, the right monitor develops a squeak that can be heard over the music. Lowering my rating from 4 to 3."
3,Thought they'd be better,"I bought these monitors and have them returned due to the right speaker rattling with low frequencies at 60% of volume default bass and treble levels. I was hoping this would be a great product. I was only disappointed after receiving my second pair; they had the same rattling sound on the very same speaker. I can't find speakers with the same features at this price.I could give it more stars because everything else is just about perfect, excellent sound in mids and highs, bass could be lower but you can't ask that much from 4.75"" cones.For me, it's more than flipping a coin when ordering this. Two in a row has to say something."
2,Sound Great but blew out quickly,"These where nice speakers for my computer, a bit big but had a nice sound to them. I'd probably have given them a 5 star rating till after about a year the right speaker blew. Still trying to see if I can get it fixed but no luck so far."
4,Works well.,"Does what it is supposed to do, and is very small. One draw-back is that the mounting bracket is not removable from the device. So, you have to fully remove the entire device (versus leaving the bracket mounuted and snapping the detector into it. But this does cut down on any warping of the suction cups due to Texas summers, so not a big deal."
3,RMR-D210,"IT WORKS , THE RANGE SEEMS TO BE 1/2 TO 3/4 OF A MILE. SUCTION CUPS MAY SOME WHAT SMALL,OVER ALL GREAT FOR THE MONEY."
2,Confusing,This is a very confusing book. Trying to figure out which form to file when caused me to go back & forth through the book. If you want a book on how to fill out the forms it's good for that. But which forms go with what others & when to file -- get a lawyer!

The contributors and I would like your experience with Java In Telecommunications to be as rewarding as possible. Best Regards, Tom"
4,"Four stars, one hole",Seems well built. Squirts water straight down from a single hole. I had a similar unit that squirted water to the side from two opposite holes. Liked that better because it wet a wider area.
3,it works.. forever guarantee from Mexico... lol,"All the paint came off after the first use... I added a shut off valve..If you hit a rock and you have to pull it out of the ground mud and mulch will get you dirty.. Was trying to find a American made root watering system.but i guess thats impossible... I did not drill any holes in it becasue that would defeat the design of the product.. I would recommend purchasing the item , but i would not use it without a shut off valve .. a brass valve cost $15 from Amazon.."
3,Disappointed,"Previously I had another product that had holes on the side and it worked better as far as inserting into the ground without clogging goes. From another review here I learned that you should have the water on while inserting, and that does help, but it still clogs occasionally.My previous one was a brand that has the fertilizing capability (which I never used), and was plastic at the top. The plastic eventually broke, hence my need and desire for a simple replacement. I got the simplicity, but maybe too simple. I'd still prefer having holes on the side as well as the single hole at the bottom, and still might drill my own.I should note that I live in an area with extremely dense heavy clay that masquerades as soil, which I'm sure doesn't help."
5,Just what my drought stricken trees needed!,"I wasn't sure I could get this to work after reading reviews about people having to drill holes in it to get it to work, but my large trees are so stressed from the extraordinary drought in Missouri I had to try it. I have to turn the water on strong to push it into my clay-packed soil then I run to the faucet and turn the water to a low flow. I let it run for 30 minutes and then move the tool 3 or 4 feet away and repeat until I get around the tree. Works like a champ!I have 6 large trees to do so I'm not seeing much difference at the top of the drooping trees yet, but I'm sure the roots are much happier below ground and will be in much better shape next spring. I'm so glad someone told me about this product. Didn't know such a thing existed."
2,Waters well until it broke within the first few weeks.,"This product worked just fine watering those bushes and small trees needing a good subterranean soaking. Unfortunately, after using it several times the coupling where the hose connects came apart. The poor design makes it impossible to reconnect the coupling. With the return period past, I'll need to see if manage a new way to make this work."
1,Shiseido super refining essence,Have been a user of many Shiseido products for many years. It is an excellent product but I will NEVER buy this product online again. Why? The contents of the bottle was only a quarter full. It lasted only one month when it should have been good for at least 3-4 months.
