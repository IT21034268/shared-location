4,BETTER LATE THAN NEVER,"I JUST PURCHASED THIS CD. IVE NEVER CONSIDERED MYSELF A BIG CHER MUSIC FAN. IVE ALWAYS ENJOYED HER MOVIES THOUGH. I PURCHASED BELIEVE BECUASE OF THE CATHY TUNES(EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD GET KINDA EURO TRASHY)AND THE PRODUCTION QUALITY. THIS CD ACTUALLY HAS SOME BETTER SONGS. "" THE MUSICS NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU"" IS JUST HOT,HOT, HOT. ""RAIN,RAIN"" IS HER DEEPSEST SOUL DIG YET. I CAN JUST PUSH REPAEAT OVER AND OVER. ALSO, DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG AND BODY TO BODY ARE HEAVY HITTERS AS WELL AND YOU CANT FORGET ""SONG FOR THE LONLEY"" WHICH GOT NO RADIO PLAY HER AT ALL. WHAT A SHAME.. GET THIS CD!!!"
5,the wait has been well worth it!,"I myself being a cher fan for over 35years would never have thought she could top ""Believe"" but she has! As much as i enjoy the previous album this one is much more polished! stand out tracks include:ALIVE AGAIN,REAL LOVE,YOU TAKE IT ALL & of course the fun WHEN THE MONEYS GONE! I have been listening to the cd for about 3 weeks now and find more and more that i enjoy about it! Rumor has it that SONG FOR THE LONELY will be the US single!(Go with ALIVE AGAIN!) Once again she amazes, rocks ands sings like the babe she is!(check out the hot photos in the liner notes!)Hope she is on a roll!"
2,really not that good,Her older songs are much better. This new CD is extremly bad and dull music. Don't buy it if you're a fan.
2,"Like the nose, this isn't the real deal","My moral rectitude was seriously and viciously pummeled when my eyes beheld the sight of Cher's new release. Her outfit was simply horrifying! What in the name of Prada was she wearing? The only place I know of where you can buy something like that is at The Cat of Nine Tails in San Francisco (or so I've heard). But even more terrifying was the music. Egad! ""Believe"" was a nice return to form, but I was seriously hoping to hear a modern ""Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves"". Instead we find another vapid skunk pile that reminds me more of my cousin Yekyl's bah mitzvah karaoke competition. Cher's music needs a facelift."
3,Good Info,"To be fair, this was the first book on the subject that I have purchased so I really don't have much else to compare it to. I do have to say that with this book I found many trails I never knew were there. Some of them right in my backyard. This book gives a lot of background on the areas as well as contact information. This contact information I think is important to obtain good maps from the parks and districts where the trails are located. That leads me to the biggest problem I had with the book. The maps appear to be hand drawn sketches. This is fine in most instances but I can think of a few times when I would have killed for a good map :) Ah but that is part of the adventure isn't it. Anyway with this book you will find many trails in the state and overall I think it is a worthwhile purchase."
3,"Sometimes great, some other bad","Some tracks are great and catchy, some others are just bad. If you really like Caetano, this was not his best work. I could live without it and somedays regret I bought it instead of one of his most famous discs."
5,a musical genius!,"this cd along with ""solo in soho"" are must haves for Phil Lynott/Thin Lizzy fans. Both solo albums showcase Philip's musical diversity. Bits of new romance, r&B, soul and good old rock n roll are showcased in both these cds. To me these are classic gems! What are you waiting for, pick 'em up, you won't be let down. God bless ya Phil!"
5,Jazz-pop fusion from the 1970s,"Donald Byrd's funky jazz arrangements comprise most of the tracks on this fine collection of music from the former Howard University professor. Two selections from Byrd's hugely popular 1974 ""Street Lady"" album are here, including that title tune and ""Lansana's Priestess"". A couple of Byrd's hits with the Blackbyrds would have made a nice addition to this CD but the music here is great from the first track to the last. Byrd's admirers would be hard-pressed to find an album that can top this one."
3,Pleasant for its nostalgic value,"Because I have been a longtime fan of this group I decided to purchase this video, and did enjoy it for its nostalgic value. My memories of Teddy Pendergast as lead was, and is inspiring, though the group's current lead is very good too, and in keeping with the tradition of the groups 'sound'. However, the downside of the video is it reminded me of a home video version, taken by one of the group's family or friend; not so much in the quality of the sound (orchestra is great) or the voices (good too), but in the overall feel of the performance - the audience was limited (quantity) and could hardly be heard. Audience response to me is part of the concert experience, and should always be enhanced to be heard. The group seemed almost to be 'rehersing' rather than performing. I would only recommend this DVD to those fans that appreciate from where this group has come and still appreciate their nostalgic worth. I gave it a *** star at the most."
5,Love it!,I got the single of Lemon Tree and Finally when I went to France in May '96 and have been listening to it ever since!!! I love this band and would recommend this cd to anyone! They're really catchy!
4,Tantilating and extremely relaxing,"Wow...My wife and I recieved this fine piece as a Hanukkah gift from my father. After putting it on my computer desk, I feel so much more relaxed. Its soothing sounds are quite melodic and hypnotic. We enjoy this for sheer relaxation after a hard day's work."
5,Wonderful!!,"This was the first time reading something by Tereza Albues and I was not very familiar with the genre -- a friend recommended the book to me. I found the story to very charming and actually laughed out loud a few times at the antics of some of her characters. What made the book even more endearing to me was when I found out that some of the characters in the book are based up on people she knew in her childhood. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great story teller and lively, amusing characters."
3,hard to decern what exactly you are buying,"Hi This is what i found when ordering this particular product from your private individual sales. the investools media has several levels of product from starting coarses to advanced coarses. Many other products as well have many types of the same product, it was very hard from the limited dicriptions to ascertain exactly what it was i was buying. I was buying the same product for several different people, as a result i bought the same wrong thing several times. with no recourse.Thanks steve"
5,Happy charming and adorable.,"A story that touches on tolerance, but is mostly a rythmic happy count of a boy who takes the time to see his world and announce how ""Fabulous"" he thinks everything is. Very cute and fun book. Everyone should have it in their children's library."
2,I miss the old one,"I grew up with the Guinness Book of World Records, and loved it. I'd devour each new edition, from cover to cover. I love facts and inane trivia, and the Guinness Book was made for people like me. The ""Guinness World Records""- what these books have become- is not the same book. It is mostly pictures. I give it two stars because some records are still present. But the new format of the book seems to be so filled with pictures that there is no room for many important records, and hence much is missing. Small black and white pictures aren't as pretty, but they allow the reader to find what they are looking for. Now, when I want to find a record, I go back to 1998, as I still have that copy. If I want to see pretty pictures and the occasional updated record, I'll look at these newer editions.This review refers to the 2001 edition."
5,Just because of the MS-haters in the room (shhhh),"I intend to rush right out to buy a copy of this product right away, simply because the techno-geeks forget that there are some of us out there who actually like the changes that are made between certain versions. One of you is a Linux-head, aren't you! Anyway, with a few notable exceptions, MS Office products have served me well over the years, and I don't have any intention of changing my mind about that now. Thanks for your input though, guys! By the way- I'll bet none of you were very cooperative at nap-time when you were kids, were you! get a life."
4,Self-contained!,"Many books claim to be self-contained. A typical self-contained book usually has an appendix and breifly discusses some mathematical preliminaries, etc. that seldom helps a genuine beginner. A typical ``self-contained book'' is also somewhat thin to incorporate all the necessary background.This is a THICK volume.And, wow, this book shows you step-by-step how to get a solution of the cable equation. To be quite honest the approach was not entirely satisfactory nor is there any attempt to go beyond the passive membrane. However, I found many precious pieces that you cannot find in any other books. The only drawback is, I believe, this book is too thorough for a beginner. Nonetheless it makes a good reference book."
3,For hardcore Harvard collectors only.,"As a Harvard alum, I was eager to get my hands on this book. The reality, however, is much less than the promise, especially coming from one of the world's best university presses. The coverage is not especially broad or deep. Instead, one finds a moderately full selection of moderately informative entries on the better-known aspects of Harvard. It's also far from mistake-free (to give one small example, the protagonist in the movie ""With Honors"" did, contrary to what A to Z says, have a copy of his thesis on his computer, but his computer was fried).All in all, this has the feel of something produced for the tourist trade. It's too bad that it has the Harvard U. Press's imprint on it."
4,Good design,"The metal in this product is very well designed steel. The ""wood"" is actually MDF, medium density fiber, which has a kind of wall paper fake cherry finish. It's durable and quite compact. You need an adjustable chair to fit your particular height to this cart."
5,Oh! Marga!,Marga Gomez is absolutely hilarious and the only thing better than seeing this hot Cuban lady perform live is listening to her cd while you bathe. Buy it. Love it. Tell your friends. Make her the superstar she deserves to be. I can't do it all by myself.
1,This is a waste of good money! Don't buy it.,"I am extremely disappointed in this product. My chid is nine and found this so boring she didn't even want to play it; it didn't even pique my interest. We purchase a lot of educational software, and it ususally glues my child to the computer. Not this one! Also, the pronunciation is not clear. If you don't already know some Spanish, I don't think you would be able to understand it. The program then uses the ""th"" pronunciation as used in Spain, and not in the rest of the Latin countries of the world. Save your $20.00 for something better."
4,Quite pleased,I bought this video and even though I haven't been all the way through it I was picking up ideas from the very beginning. Especially for a beginning shawl knitter it quite nice. - I buy it again. Also the vendor was very nice to work with.
4,The funniest sh.. in comedy,Hey this show was hilarious. I mean it discussed some deep sh.. but they kept it real with true comedy and lots of laughter. Although it was full of explicit language it was still a good show to watch as we did with Kings Of Comedy only this show is filled with the funniest bit.... in time. So if you haven't caught it on Showtime then I think you should order it today along with The Kings Of Comedy for your at home enjoyment.
5,GREAT STORIES!! I LOVE U STEPHEN KING!,"i can remember reading this book when i was in JHS and the story of 'the boogeyman'scaring me so badly that i literally had problems feeling comfortable with my closet for years! i had long since forgotten about this collection of short stories until recently a friend of mine brought up the title. Almost as though i was hypnotized, i had to go buy the book again and I am glad i did. I loved re reading all of these old stories again. definitely creepy! my favorites were the boogeyman, the man who loved flowers, battleground and quitters inc. check it out!!"
4,Tightly crafted and ingeniously twisted,A superb blend of dark and monstrous beings from nightmares and other worlds mixed with possible alternate realities gives this book a special flare for terror that only Stephgen King can produce.
4,VERY GOOD SHORT STORIES,"I loved this collection of short stories. I only gave it a 8 rating because some of the the stories are a little hard to read but for the most part they are very fun and suspenful!! I loved ""The Lawnmower Man"", nothing at all like the boring film, I also loved ""The Last Rung On The Ladder"", also a very good short story. ""The Children Of The Corn"" was a little disapointing though. But for the most part this collection of short stories is worth reading."
5,This book turned me on to reading,I was never much of a reader until I read this book when I was 19 years old. I was deployed on a nuclear-powered submarine (The USS TUNNY SSN 682)somewhere in the pacific ocean when I saw a copy of this book in our ship's library. I picked it up and was immediately drawn into the characters and circumstances surrounding these short stories. I began reading other Stephen King novels as well as many other authors. I would like to thank Mr. King because it was his books that inspired me to read and I have never stopped turning the pages in many books since that day under the water back in 1981.
4,sometimes a little too scary!,"I'd recommend this book on the boogeyman alone. It is probably the scariest damn thing I've ever read. Some of these stories didn't do much for me, but most of them move along at a good clip, are extremely vivid, and more than a little dark and scary."
5,The Night Shift,This book is amazing. Every story is so well written. The boogyman and Quitters inc. are the best two stories in the book. The detail and well thought plots are great. This book is easily one of Steven KIngs best.
4,Some Great Early Works,"Many Great stories, some bad ones. These are Stephen King's early works. Jerusalems Lot is one of his best."
2,Hmmm....,"As much as I love her, Margaret Cho just wasn't very funny this time around, in my opinion. This CD has a couple of funny moments on it that made me laugh out loud, but unfortunately they are too few and far between for me to really recommend this CD. Margaret Cho's previous material is much, much funnier than this, and I hope her next effort is better than ""Drunk With Power"" is."
5,Helps even us backwater yokels drink like sophisticats,"I have enjoyed the whole ""littloe black book..."" series, but there the best has to be either the martini or the cocktail book.With such useful quotes as ""if the Lord hadn't inteded a three martini lunch why did he put so many olive trees in the holy land"", you can now go back to work sloshed and informed. The pages are thick and stand up to hanging around on my counter while I try mixing martinis.Recipe for a good martini book2 parts history1 part funny quotes6 parts interesting recipes3 parts well made book compnentsshake and serve"
3,caution: all lower case letters,"I did not think this was a bad ""little"" book. But I interpreted the word ""little"" to mean the size of the book, which in fact, was little. However I think what they meant was that all the letters in the dot-to-dots were lower case, i.e. ""little"" letters. This makes a big difference at that very young age where they are just learning their alphabet. My daughter could have done a capital letter dot-to-dot independently, but needs alot of guidance with the lower case version. That's not necessarily a bad thing - it just depends on what stage of letter recognition your child is, and whether you had planned to have your child use the book independently or not."
2,Size does matter.,"To begin with, it is my own fault for not reading the dimensions. I made the assumption that this would be a normal sized book. It is not. The ""Little"" in the title is not a reference to the age it is appropriate for; it is describing the actual size. This is not a good size for my child and is hard for her to read. It would have received a much higher rating had it been a normal sized book."
3,"Most of the Big U.S. Hits, Some Filler","Not exactly a comeback, since its single ""I Need Love"" stiffed on the charts in 1992; still, many of her most popular U.S. hits are here, and those seeking the best will find them on this CD. We'll all have to wait for a more complete compilation that includes the hits ""If Not For You,"" ""Something Better to Do,"" ""Let it Shine,"" ""Let Me Be There,"" ""Come on Over,"" ""Don't Stop Believin',"" and a slew of other pop hits from 1980 - 85 that do not appear here."
5,Perfect pop collection of breathless ballads & catchy pop,"The new songs cover all spectrums (sex kitten dance pop to twangy country storysongs) and the old favorites span a decade plus of great songs (A Little More Love, Magic, Summer Nights) and instant Classics (Hopelessly Devoted You You, You're the One That I Want, I Honestly Love You). A Must Have for Olivia fans and pop music lovers."
4,boxing gloves,gloves were fine but they took forever to get to us. Impatient boxer waiting for gloves for over two weeks.
3,Good for show,"I used them as props for an event I was doing. They work great for that. But outside of looking at them, I don't think they're real great."
3,Good protection but hard to put on and take off.,"These gloves offer good hand protection for heavy bag work or sparring. The velcro closures work well but the gloves are hard to put on and take off alone. They do not breathe at all. Decent value for the money, but I'll spend more next time to get a better designed glove."
1,Neverlast,"Got these for Christmas on the 25th...destroyed them on the 26th. Although the gloves absorbed the impact of some bag strikes, the pleather ripped after only a few hits. These are not bag gloves, and they will quickly fall apart with even light bag training."
4,Great,"I'm new to boxing, so I don't have a wealth of experience with gloves, but I would like to say that they don't give me any problems"
4,good sparring gloves,good gloves for the price. I wouldn't use these for much more than working out on a heavy bag as they can start to make the thumbs and knuckles hurt.
2,Not very durable or very good,"I bought these gloves as a replacement for some cheap $20 bulk generic made-in-China gloves my boxing gym has available. Because they are Everlast, I thought they would be good. I've been very disappointed. These gloves offer almost no wrist support, and I had to start using wraps to protect my wrists. After about 4 weeks of medium-duty use, the vinyl is peeling and the stitching is falling apart. The only good thing I can say about them is that they don't smell as bad as other gloves I've used, so they do seem to resist odor as advertised."
3,Decent boxing gloves,I bought these gloves for my Krav Maga class. They are very durable and comfortable. They hold up well during long drills as well as combat sparring.
3,functional product,"these gloves are fine for my cardio boxing class, i do not recommend them for anything more serious."
1,More like Neverlast or Evercrap,"Recently joined a Muay Thai training class and bought these 16oz Everlast gloves. After a little over a month, they were busted. The outer layer is a cheap material; just a flimsy paper thin plastic (vinyl?) cover. It burst open and exposed the cheap foam inside after standard use. The product really feels like a toy. The Title gloves are only a few bucks more and feels really sturdy. I purchased those after this Neverlast crapped out on me. Don't waste your money on this junk."
2,new design not working for me!,"I prefer old design over new. I found the new design to be too shear as evidenced by two runs destroying two stockings shortly after putting them on. Also, the stockings are harder for me to put on.Is it still possible to buy stockings with older design?"
2,Does not stay up,"I was disappointed this product did not stay up. Had to return and ever since I bought the product, I am somehow on this company's auto mail list, which is very annoying!"
2,8-15 mmHg is no better than regular knee high stockings,"I was hoping for better compression. To me, the 8-15 mmHg of compression felt like regular knee high stockings, but more expensive. They were not more comfortable or felt better, just thicker. I was dissapointed, especially for the price. If you are looking for more compressin than a regular knee highs, may want to go above the 15 mmHg."
2,Looks cool but needs improvement,You have to pry off the front face of the case everytime you want to add or remove CD/DVD drives with the screwless junk. They should have just left it for use with screws. Their screwless desgin is more of a hassle than just using screws. The position of the harddrive slots makes it difficult or impossible to use large video cards. I really liked the way it looked but it's just not worth the hassle.
3,SOCOM Fireteam Bravo,"Fun game and very good graphics . The only drawback is that the game (is single player mode) is way too short! With only 11 missions, the game was over when I was just getting into it. I know now why there is a fireteam bravo 2.."
5,It's pretty good,"First off, in case you are wondering, I'm not under 13. I'm actually 15. I just didn't feel like signing into Amazon. To the review, I think this is a truly dominating PSP game. I'm going to give you the pros and cons of this game.Pros:1. The graphics. For a PSP game, they are a force to be reckoned with2. Good missions3. Nice weapons4. Instant action. For this you can do 5 objectives in a mission course, Hostage Extract (rescue a hostage(s)), Stealth Extract (rescue a hostage(s) while staying covert), Sweep & Clear (you eliminate all enemies in specific areas), Sabotage (you sabotage a radio(s)), and Stealth Sabotage (disable a radio(s) while remaining covert).5. The locations for missions6. Almost everything else.Cons:Just two minor cons.1. The person who gives you intel and compliments you on the stuff gets annoying.2. If LONESTAR dies, the mission is compromised. I don't like that much.Final note: I'm going to rent SOCOM 3 now. If it is better than this game, it will be amazing!"
1,SOUQUETTA,"GOOD NIGHT I CAN COMENTARDEL GAME IS JUST THE PACKAGE THAT CAME WITHOUT UMD, AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW IF I WAS GIVEN TO COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT IN TRUTH NOT LOST BUT WHERE IS THAT WHEN desert ABRI HAD NO DISC UMDNO MORE WAITING FOR AN ANSWER ME DISMISSALEscucharLeer fonéticamente¡Nuevo!

2,waste of time,"I have a 22 month old. This video is useless. They discuss where ducks and lambs go potty, then they spend 5 minutes talking about Page and Parker Panda picking out their favorate pair of underwear so they can march in the big kid parade. I think children learn from watching other children using the potty and this is all about cartoon animals. Then they have the panda testing the kids and he's asking ""is this a potty chair? No its a wagon! Is this a potty chair? No its a beach pale!"" I mean,can this be any more ridiculous? and the voice is so condescending, which would be ok if they actually taught children something. Don't waste your money. I have heard that Potty Power shows real children and I am going to try that video."
5,Love It,My son loved this DVD. He self initiated going potty after watching it and says 'no more diapers'. We watch it once a day and it seems to be working like a charm to help encourage him.
3,"Cute video, but not a motivator","My 3 year old really enjoyed the video and the music is catchy, but it did not motivate him use the potty ... even after asking to watch it 3 times a day for a week! This was the second video we tried with the same outcome ... workbooks didn't help either. Our potty success came by having him wear underwear (which he fought at first) and giving little sticker and candy rewards each try, plus a wrapped potty present for each day he had a successful potty during the first week."
5,GET THIS!,"Handsdown the BEST help on potty training. Had a 2 year old that HATED being a big girl and going to the big girl potty, until she watch this DVD. The first day she was already going #2 in the potty! the first week i give her about an 80%!"
5,This Book is a Hoot!!!,"It's Uncle Lubin's responsibility to take care of Baby Peter, but before he can blink, the infant is snatched from his clutches by the evil bag-bird [think stork on steroids] who flies off to the moon with his captive. Well, obviously poor Uncle Lubin has to retrieve the babe or face the wrath of the child's mother so he sets out on a quest to rescue poor Peter. The running gag here is that every time Lubin encounters a new creature or person there is a story to be told and Peter's doting uncle doesn't seem to be in a very big hurry to come to the rescue. This is William Heath Robinson's masterpiece [his brother, Charles, was much more mainstream] and shouldn't be missed."
1,Purdy Does it Again,"I picked this book up in Borders and sat with it for about an hour. It is worse than For Common Things, which was Purdy's over-hyped first work. Purdy quotes from Thoreau, he quotes from Burke, and he quotes some Egyptian girls he ran into in Egypt, yet he never contributes anything himself which is quotable. He'd like to be Jefferson, or de Tocqueville, but he is a victim of the liberal elite's contemporary educational system which razes men of passion and cannonizes indifferent men of quiet desperation. What does Purdy think? Everything and nothing. He is the grand eyeball. He stands squarely in the postmodern gray, telling us that Admam Smith was right and wrong, that capitalism is good and bad, that it is the best of times and the worst of times. How true it is, and how vastly intelligent he must be, to be so far above and indifferent to the deaths of 3,000 Americans on American soil."
5,Inspiring Resource for Writers,"From page one, Rachel Simon's The Writer's Survival Guide has an inspiration in my daily writing routine. It truly is amazing how one quick fix of a sentence or paragraph sparks my imagination hurrying me onward to my next creative thought. This book is a must for every serious writer."
5,Great purchase,"These bikes are traditionally styled for boys, but I was looking for a freestyle bike for my daughter, and this bike was a great choice for either boys or girls. Also, we shopped around, and this was a fantastic value. It was a bit complicated to assemble, but as long as you carefully follow the instructions it's doable."
4,Is this Carly Smithson from American Idol!?!?!,Different last name might be because she married? If this is HER then this CD is really awesome! She has an absolutely amazing voice - I can't BELIEVE she was voted off of American Idol!
3,Is this a 90's album?,"Wow...for an album (cd) released in 1995 it sure sounds buried in the 80's...whats with the ""mass"" of guitars and drums...scale it down Bob! Your voice may be consinderably weaker..but no need to bury it totally with 80's flash...ok..enough bitching...I actually enjoyed several cuts of this cd. ""Lock"", ""Manhattan"", ""Hands in the Air"" all stand out as fun rockers. Too bad this guy only release music only 2 times every decade...its songs like these that make us forget our troubles and just rock and have fun...EVEN if it is outdated sounding! Keep it comin Bob!"
3,"Get ""Hands In The Air"" on the air","It seems silly to evaluate music the way Consumer Reports magazine rates appliances. Hasn't your opinion of songs, albums and recording artists changed over the years? Anyway, one way to determine how much you like an album is to choose how many songs you would tape-record if you had borrowed a friend's copy of it. I would tape every song from Bob Seger's IT'S A MYSTERY. Not that I think it's a great album, but each tune has at least something memorable about it. Several IT'S A MYSTERY songs - ""Golden Boy,"" ""Rite of Passage,"" ""I Wonder"" have an unfinished feel, trailing off just as you are starting to enjoy them. Then there's ""Hands In The Air,"" a catchy guitar-driven dance tune that would be a hit if radio gave it a chance. IT'S A MYSTERY's worth getting - at a bargain price."
5,Tryly Healing,"I love this CD so much I own two of them. As Latin is still the language of the Catholic church, it is awesome to be able to read the text of the songs from the accompanying leaflet and sing the songs both in Latin & English. They lift up my soul!"
3,Diddle Daddle Duckling,The cover and binding of the book was not as nice as I thought it would be. It did not meet my expectations.
4,One More Reason To Love MS Word.,"MS Word's 2002 upgrade makes a great product even better. Smart tags, the ability to select multiple chunks of text so that cut/pasting is easier, document translation- and many more features make the upgrade a must-have for any faithful Word user.I've used WordPerfect for necessary jobs, but would rather work solely with MS Word. This package is even worth having to register, the only real drawback, with Microsoft for continued use. If you work with Word, upgrade- you will be glad you did."
3,Teachers: Not Classroom Friendly,"As a junior high teacher, I am pleased to have the film versions of the S.E. Hinton books available to me. They are wonderful follow-up material to round out the week we spend reading a book. Of all that we read, my students most enjoyed ""Rumble Fish"". Unfortunately, having seen the movie myself the last time when I was in high school and it was a new release, I had forgotten about Coppola trying to make this seem more realistic, more relevant to his target audience. The language was more harsh than I can get away with in a classroom setting, and there is the hinted at textually, but completely superfluous quasi-graphic sex scene. Not much for an adult, not too harsh for a kid going to the theatre with friends, but completely inappropriate in the classroom. Bought it, previewed it, couldn't show it. Good movie, worth watching and owning, but teachers beware: Not Classroom Friendly."
3,A little too shallow,"While he introduces a lot of the helpful hints to do a good job, he doesn't go into detail about enough of the hints. He talks about using a wood file to shave off the ends, but goes through it too fast. It should have been twice as long with more detail. He says to get caulk, but never tells of how to use it. I didn't think it was comprehensive."
4,Pretty funny,Pretty funny. I especially liked the part about the whale research. I'll leave it at that so I don't spoil it.
5,Funny like me,"Brian Regan is funny the way I try to be funny. His comedy is acceptable to everyone. It's clean - I have five kids and the worst he says is ""what the hell,"" and he only says that a few times. The best comedy is the true life stuff that we can all identify with. I love his voice. He shouts, sounds like a kid - it sounds weird, but he's great."
5,One of the top five comedy albums of all time!,"This CD is amazingly funny. And, like all classic comedy albums, it gets better with every listen. Many reviewers have stated that this CD is ""clean"" humor. Yes, true, but it's not clean for the sake of being clean, such as Jerry Seinfeld's humor is. It's clean because Brian packs so much hilarious material into his routine, that there's no time for profanity."
4,I Mean You!,"Get this disc for only one thing - Coltrane's insane, hyper-extended solo on ""I Mean You!!"" And that version of ""In Walked Bud"" is pretty damn good too!"
4,"Hello, Blue Sky","While many will miss the experimentation and mania of Wilco's two previous LPs, Sky Blue Sky is an immediate and superb collection of songs. To release another album of obtuse and ingenious tracks might have been just a little too much, and if Kicking Television taught us anything, it's that at their heart, Wilco is a band not afraid of simply great melodies and making the utmost of standard instrumentation. Sky Blue Sky is the logical next step for a band that has been through many a mill and maybe, for a moment anyway, is ready to settle back and play."
4,Providing Back of book detail,"With her father murdered by renegade Apaches, Tessa Reeves feared she'd be their captive forever - that no one would ever find her. And even if she were found, she'd be scorned by those who called Indians savages...and their woman prisoners forever unclean.John Hawkins knew how it felt to be an outcast. Born to a woman who'd suffered a brutal attack, the rugged lawman had had to develop a will of steel to survive in a harsh world. If anyone could save Tessa, it was he.They were a man and a woman who had known violence and tragedies. Yet even with desperados and hostile Indians all around them, John and Tessa discovered they wanted something more - a chance at happiness, a future worth fighting for, and a love as wild and free as the land they called home."
4,Buy From Amazon.co.uk website - New Tintin DVD and in reasonable price,"All the Tintin DVDs (all together 21 adventures) are avaiable in www.amazon.co.uk site in ENGLISH, with reasonable price. These are brand new and original DVDs. I received my order in 7 days by airmail. Why will you pay so much money to buy ""USED"" DVDs??The UK DVDs are of Region-2 - but most of the recent DVD players, specially the cheaper one, can now play DVDs of any region - with no problem!!"
3,A Movie About a Man and His Pajamas,"Terri is a sweet, modern fable about a quirky, giant kid who really likes wearing pajamas. Not only does Terri, the giant teen, have to suffer the daily humiliation of being the weird giant kid who wears pajamas to high school, he also has to take care of Creed from NBC's The Office, who plays against type as the old man. Terri learns life lessons from John C. Reilly, the goofy Vice Principal, falls in love with a girl of average height, and befriends a misfit who pees on his pants on purpose and then puts them on---a true depiction of high school, if ever there was one. Terri is basically The Station Agent meets My Giant meets Glee (without any singing or dancing) and just like all three, it was alright."
2,"Good, but not $$$ better than OpenOffice.org","Of course, Excel is a lovely product, though whether you need the upgrade is highly questionable. I found this pretty much just MS trying to create a need they can charge for. Especially since you can open and create Excel spreadsheets for free without actually buying Excel... or order StarOffice 6.0 here on Amazon.Excel 2002 is fine, but like a $6000 umbrella stand for your dog, not a lot of people actually need it."
2,Same Old Program,This is basically an upgrade to Excel. There is no way the upgrade is worth the price.
2,15 minute read with little substance,"I knew this wouldn't be a book of glossy color images, but hoped it would have some engaging discussion about flowers as an art medium. Sadly there is little text and mostly obscure quotes from a Vienna florist upon which the entire book revolves. Quotes from the shop owner(s) about why they're having a crappy day, or why some clients make them mad is worthless. @ interesting images are the only reason I din't give just 1 star. If you want a great detailed book on floral art and sculpture go the books by Gregor Lersch instead of this pamphlet-esque booklet."
4,SCARED GEOMETRY,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK - BUT I ALREADY HAD THE BOOK - THEY HAD CHANGEDTHE COVER - SO IT WAS MY ERROR
5,A very solid film,"Farewell Darkness is not only a story about Vets its a story about blue collar America. It's a story that covers love, rage, trauma, low income classes and gives us a really good view of what America REALLY looks like vs. what Hollywood depicts America as...the performances are amazing and the critical reviews speak for themselves...for a true film buff it's definitely worth the watch!""Director Daniel J. Pico crafts an intense drama whose hair-trigger shifts from lyricism to brutality mirror the unpredictable contours of their hero's psyche. Pico works visual wonders on a low budget; the impressive combat scenes put many a mainstream production to shame.""- The Gene Siskel Film Center - Chicago."
1,This book is garbage for biomed,"This book is a compilation of old electronic exam questions reminiscent of military ratings exams. It might be useful for a general electronics review or CET exam (although it is horribly out of date). It is utterly useless for a biomedical exam. Do not buy it for that purpose. The publisher should remove the word ""Biomedical"" from the title and replace it with ""Electronic""."
2,Interesting but very familiar!,"A very interesting take on the ""Bat"" taken by Stan Lee, interesting but unspectacular. It all seems very similar but lacked the ""iradiated"" bat bite. Stans Bat character seems the polar opposite of the original and is therefore worth a look."
1,Avoid MPIO products,"Summing up: VERY short battery life, buggy software, recordings might fail at the last second of recording, very slow FFWD (fast forward),and lastly but most importantly:MPIO is NOT giving support. MPIO is... a farce.I strongly recommend iriver players. Iriver is a brand that has good worldwide support AND is far superior in quality and features. (iriver is Korea's nr. 1, MPIO is nr. 2 perhaps, but at a far, far, FAR distance!)"
3,OK,I like this book since it has the fundamentals for CDL driving. It is in good condition and is a good bargain.
4,A rather big tube,"The website mentions the tube is 36 inches in diameter, but I wish the site also mentions it is intended for ages 9+ as its package does. It is indeed a big tube.The picture shown here is a plain blue tube, but the one that I've received has many bubble patterns which does not bother me.The tube itself is OK so far."
2,"If you're a beat scholar, maybe worth reading","This isn't worth reading unless you are a beat scholar...It isn't insightful, interesting or very creative. It is however self-indulgent and rambling."
4,Great Book,"Explains the relationships between the sexes in the context of Evolutionary Psychology. I have recommended this book to several of my female friends who want to better understand why men are they way they are. This book provided me with some great insights and comfort at a time I was going through a painful breakup. Much more interesting, believable and useful than ""Men Are From Mars and Women Are From Venus."
5,""" The right stuff ""","This is a very up lifting cd, Najee is at his best.It is sexysmooth & sensual that about says it all! "" a winner """
3,good resource like it says on the cover!,"For all those touched by adoption. Dispels the myths.I also recommend:For Late Discovery Adoptees: ""Adoption Forum"" by Kasey HamnerFor anyone touched or interested in a true-life story: ""Whose Child?"" by Kasey Hamner""Primal Wound"" by Nancy Verrier"
4,haunting of winchester house,The movie has a lot of scary points in it if you like that in a ghost haunting type movie. There are times that it is hard to understand what is going on cause you see many different things (sort of speak ) popping out at you. The ending of the movie make you re think the whole film and I had to watch it many times to start to understand the hints they give through out the movie. Some things I heard the second and third time I watched it now make me understand the ending more. I would really like to know what is real about the terrifying true story. when you see the end it makes you wonder what part of the story is true. All in all I bought it and will watch it many time over just cause I like to see if there is things I can spot in the film I did not see the first few times I saw it.
2,What happened?,"I've been on a quest for a good old fashioned ghost story for a long time. No super CGI effects, just some good creepyness in the dark. The first 30 minutes of this movie, I thought I may have found what I wanted. Then it went from creepy to crappy in 30 seconds flat. It's like it switched directors or scripts at that point and everything went downhill, the effects, the acting, the plot... It suddenly became a cheese fest. I give it 2 stars for the first 1/3rd only. Nice try, but I wouldn't waste my money."
3,This should be at the gift shop at Winchester Mystery House !,"theasylum.ccWritten by Jose Prendes,Directed by Mark Atkins.This has some elements to behold.Scary moments aplenty,Make-ups on victims of the Winchester Rifle are great and spooky.The cast is very real in their performance and story comes to logical conclusion.The 3D version is OK,Im not sure if it added something.What was great was this-Based on truth and WHO hasnt been to Winchester Mystery House ?Wow factor,Is how come didnt use the Real House instead of CGI mockup ?You know copies are gonna end up in gift shop,LOL.Great box art as usual and whole film has a `Retro' vibe of exploitation films that baby boomers can remember."
4,Rammy's Review,"Frankly, when I finished Billy Collins' introduction, which discussed the deficiencies in our system of teaching poetry in the U.S., I felt that I had my money's worth! It was an excellent explanation of why we all avoided poetry in our early years instead of embracing it. Obviously, I enjoyed the poems which were included but the intro really grabbed me from the gitgo. Rammy"
4,Great war memoir,"I really liked this memoir because it talked about one of the campaigns of World War II that Americans just don't hear as much about. In addition, Fraser discussed his role in the fighting in a way that was both clear and realistic. He admits that many of the details are hazy at best after this many years, but the things he remembers are related in a way that brings the other men in his Section to memorable life. Fraser does not shy away from the more grisly aspects of his service, nor does he dwell on them unnecessarily."
5,Made Me Feel at Home,"This is not your so called war stories. It is about a man and the men he served with without any liberal gibberish (see his references to more modern times)and the fact that wars happen and will happen, just or unjust depending on one's views. But, they won't go away like some Utopian dreamers think just because other ""Utopians"" weren't up to it. There were so many pages that hit me in the gut because one could so readily identify with things on the page. I never expected such a great book from a journalist / media person which proves that there is good in every crowd. I salute Fraser and I wish I could tell him so in person."
1,disappointing,"This book may be of use to a high school or college student but was of no use to me, living in Japan and looking for some tips to improve my fluency."
1,awful,I just brought this product and it was a waste of money. It did not steam well and linked water all over my wood floors.....I am returning this item asap.
3,Disappointed - immersion not done well (no cues),"I bought this program for my 6-year-old to play by herself while I finished out my workday at home after she returns from school. I suppose I can't complain because the program states it uses the immersion method, but I thought it would give more cues (like a picture of a butterfly, and someone saying in French ""A butterfly. There is a butterfly."") Instead, it just launches into full French with very little context or vocabulary practice to help understand what is being said. My daughter knows some French, but she was quickly annoyed because she had no idea what was being said or how to play other than randomly clicking icons. The only way the program is useful is if I sit with her and explain everything, which was not I had hoped for. Graphics and games are also very basic."
4,Friedrich,"Friedrich is a acceptable young gent who spends most of his timefrolicing around Germany during World WarII. He is a pretty boy.With an imageination of a young girl.I rate this book a sparkiling 4 stars proundly. If you are looking for a bookon a young boys dareing adventure this is not the book for you. If you are looking for a partial love story this is the book for you. Friedrich has a lot of things other books may not have. This is a book about a frindship with a Jewish boy and a non Jewish boy. It goes through the rights and wrongs of childhood, during the Houlocaust. You should read this bookish thing. This friendship falls through thick and thin, right and wrong. My friends of the world please trust this book it will do no harm to me nor you."
2,"Light-hearted sci-fi comedy, emphasis on light. =)","Hello, fellow readers!This book was purchased mainly to complete my current SSR collection, and although decent at a few places, it lacked the comedy ""punch"" that the others in the series had. In my opinion, the comedy aspect in this book compared to the others in the series is the worst, but then again it did provide a nice mystery, which I reluctantly followed. Still, it was worth the few bucks I paid. Don't get if you don't follow the SSR series, though, it'll be a waste of time."
3,"the Stainless steel rat,,,,","Jim Bolivar DeGriz, intergalatic thief strikes again. Hack book- Harrys not quite on the ball with these series after his first successfull few"
2,Details of Care giving Technics visual explaned,"Details of Care giving Techniques visual explained are mostly missed. You just see how to change a bed sheet. The real interesting stuff, things you couldn't experience easily in daily live are missing."
1,WASTE OF MONEY + BOOK IS 10 YEAR OLD,"Got the book, its actually a tiny booklet. At most, a big blog post you can say.The language is easy and I loved reading whats written inside. But WHY THEY ARE SELLING THIS BOOK TILL DATE? it does not contain anything at all after year 2000!! Seriously, why would you want to pay for a book that does not even contain latest information? - for which you have paid money.I would suggest you to reconsider your decision before you purchase this tiny booklet - the information that you'd find else where for free ( wikipedia page on jeff bejos is much better than this book)for me, its a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. why these guys are selling 10 year old information!!"
1,A Basic Text,This book barely covers the basics of ustation. Intermediate users should look elsewhere.
1,Disgusting,"These chips are nasty. I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag, no the chips were just soaked with grease. Nasty!!"
3,Things you need to know,"Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes ""too much"". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.On the package it says these are ""Krinkle Cut"" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems."
3,"Do they have to ""bite back""?","I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though."
5,My favorite Kettle Chip,"These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag."
3,boulder salt and malt vinegar chips are way better,"These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips. THOSE are awesome."
5,Great with Chicken and Potatoes,"My friend gave me Jamaican Curry for a gift, but I couldn't find another one, so I ordered this one. This is perfect with chicken and potatoes. I'm sure it will work for other meals, but I'm not the most creative or adventurous in the kitchen. Though it says ""hot,"" I did not find it so.Because my husband and son ""hate curry,"" I've been calling this ""Jamaican pepper,"" just to get them to eat my baked potatoes. I don't know how long I'll be able to get away with it. Maybe by the time they catch me in my lies, they will be converts.Great buy for the price and spice."
2,Outlook 2002 slower than Outlook 2000,"Besides Hotmail support, there really is no difference between Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002 except for speed. If you already have Outlook 2000, DO NOT UPGRADE! Why? Because it is slower than Outlook 2000 (at least on my machine). In Outlook 2000, I used to be able to click on a message and it would instantly pop up. In Outlook 2003, it takes a good 2-3 seconds. As the saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
4,Effective & Efficient Professional Bottom Dollar Saver!,"This software meets the needs for small and large operations of any office. It is especially effective for people who need to keep multiple others informed of their schedule, abreast of meetings, aware of trainings etc... It is also an excellent tickler system to keep one's self on top of their schedule and responsibilties. It is an asset to employer, management and employees. All will make great use with minimal need for training. It is easy to learn and use."
5,Simply Gorgeous!!,"I love to collect Barbies! I started my collection when I was fourteen-years-old, and now I have several hundred. Out of all the Barbie series, I love the Princess collection the best.This doll is so beautiful! Her gown is a beautiful burgundy, her crown is gorgeous and sparkly. Her shoes will fall off when you try to play with her. I suggest you do not take her out of her collector box, nor try to change her clothes, they will rip.9/10 stars~~Kat"
3,Outstanding in Stand Up,I first heard a few bits by Mr. Collins on XM Comedy and it prompted me to buy this album. His wit and humor are off center and make him stand out from many of the others in his field. He has a great range of voices that are funny and easy to follow. I love his Dog's comments. The cd has only one track so forwarding to a deep section of the album is not possible without a long fast forward. Three stars.
4,the beginning,this is the beginning of the kinks as truly great artists.they progress here and show they have much talent.they are really close to getting to the ultimate level which they would reach musically and lyrically in 2 years.almost every song is good here.the kinks from now till arthur their last great album made music on a level so high that after arthur they never reached that level again.but we have these cd's to remind us how good they really were.
2,"Well, it tries to be entertaining...","Out of 5 kids who've tried my copy of this game, none were entertained enough to keep at it. It does try to be entertaining but there's nothing that really challenges them effectively or offers any kind of real educational content. This game is just fluff, and far from Humongous's best work. Look for it used if you ""have to have it""."
5,Sublimalicious,This is the greatest band ever!!! It stimulates all the senses!!! It is dreamlike.... It is the Cocteau Twins....Enough Said!!!!
4,ethereal bliss,"The Twins once again establishing their trademark sound?Swirling guitars,ambient keyboards and lush vocal sounds which are a composition of various languages.The songs are a little more mellow and atmospheric than past releases,such as Blue Bell Knoll and Heaven Or Las Vegas.Standouts include Theft And Wandering Around Lost,Squeeze Wax,My Truth,Essence and Pur."
3,Not so great like the others,"When ""Tourisam"" got out, I was very excited. I was looking forwart buying it. Finaly I was holding it in my hands and playing on my CD player. I must say, I was little disapointed. Some of the songs simply were not what I am looking for. ""The heart shapped sea"", ""It must have been Love"", and ""Never is a long time"" are not very great music on what I am use to listen from Roxette. However some of the songs like ""How do you do"", ""Silver blue"", ""Come back before you live"" and ""Queen of rain"", raise my faith in this gorgeous band."
3,No extra tracks,I was very disappointed because the album did not come with the three extra tracks as promised. The rest of the CD is the same as the original.
5,very funny man,"The minute i saw him on ""Que Locos"" and Comdey Central i said to myself that was definitely a CD i was going to have to get. From his impersonations to his racial (NOT RACIST) humor....this man is definitely worth checking out! And Look for his new CD too thats coming out soon or already out!"
2,What's the big deal?,"Sorry, I bought this based upon the other recommendations and was sorely disappointed. Best I can say is that it is relatively clean. Laughed a couple times. Most of the CD is an exercise in Pablo's impersonation abilities -- which aren't bad. Most of it is poking harmless fun at other cultures, mixed with his singing. If you want to laugh, I suggest Brian Regan. He's clean and hilarious."
3,This one is an average CD,"I find 9 out 17 songs in this album are listenable, especially ""Let Me In"" and ""Friends"". These two songs are extremely hard to find and I got lucky to buy the CD."
5,Yummy!,"Shadow of the Dolls is a fitting sequel to Jacqueline Susann's ""Valley of the Dolls"". Rae Lawrence certainly did Jaqueline justice with this. Though it is not necessary to have read ""Valley..."", it does make this book that much better if you do. I couldn't put this book down. I was so interested in the lives of Anne and Neely and Lyon. The characters became part of me for the 3 days it took me to read this book. I wish there was another one. When I was finished reading it I was sad because it was over. I want to read it again."
2,Did she even read the first book,"Okay, I had some MAJOR problems with this book. It's over 20 years since the first book ended and Anne, Neely, and Lyon haven't aged a bit? They've regressed in age? Jennifer is now 7? And that's just the start of it.She may have been using a manuscript that Susann put together for a sequel but this falls WELL below the mark. It was a wholly unsatisfying read with an ending that made me go....WHAT? Some scenes were just not set up well enough and other scenes just fell flat on their face. Yes, it was nice to revisit these characters but when they aren't in the hands of a gifted storyteller like Susann then it's not worth the visit."
3,Well written trash :-),"I LOVED Jacqueline Susann's ""Valley of the Dolls"", so I was very eager to read this sequel written by Rae Lawrence.Reading this book as a follow-up to ""Valley of the Dolls"" might be confusing, due to the change of time and dates in this book.But I got over it, and I'm fine with the updates.But had Rae Lawrence changed the names of the characters here, this book could easily stand on it's own feet. And been seen as an updated version of ""Valley of the Dolls"", instead of a sequel.Anyway, I enjoyed reading this book, but it left me with one question in mind: Why doesn't Anne need to go to rehab???"
3,Shadow was just ok,"I feel like the only person on the face of the earth that hasn't read, ""Valley of the Dolls"" - yet. I read that ""Shadow"" was a good read and it wasn't necessary to read ""Valley"" first. I wish I had but I don't know if it would have changed my mind. Perhaps their's, Anne and Neely, is just not my life style and I couldn't relate to the characters. I just borrowed ""Valley of the Dolls"" from my library. I'll see if this is better and if it makes ""Shadow of the Dolls"" better."
1,"Something Rotten? This ""novel!""","When we read the original VALLEY OF THE DOLLS(sometimes even sneak reading it), we knew we were reading trash. But it was enjoyable trash, with a storyline that just didn't quit. Supposidly Susann spent months writing the outline for this sequel. Did author Lawrence read it? Don't think so. The writing itself isn't bad, sometimes even admirable, but the story is just so bad it isn't even funny. And, the entire book covers 14 years continuously....yet it is just a few pages over 300 and lots of space and large type there. Think the ""novelist"" knew it was a loser and wanted to get back to her own, more resonable, writings so she dashed this out...saving anything good for her own books. Save your money on this one. It purports to be a sequel to VALLEY, but, in reality, it's not.....just bad is all. For a much better read, try LONELY JUNCTIONS by R C Lemos. Now THAT'S a story that doesn't quit!"
3,These Bellys Almost Flopped!,"I can't be sure if it was just my batch, but they were mostly gray in color and rather stale. Although Jelly Belly is my favorite candy I doubt that I would purchase these Flops again!"
3,Outlet order,I just received my first order of Belly Flops & Hodge Podge ordered online and was pleased with both! A nice variety in both bags!
4,jelly belly flops,I recieved 4 bags of flops but was suppose to get a free additional bag . I put in the special code .Not sure I am going to order through amazon again for candy.
2,Only 4-5 flavors,"I ordered 3 belly flop bags about 2 months ago, and all I received were 3 bags that contained the same 4-5 flavors, two of which I hated (black licorice and coconut). I was really disappointed! You say that you promise you'll give an ""excellent variety of mixes"" if we order more than one bag, but that definitely was NOT the case for me."
3,Kind of Bummed,"I just got my order of Belly Flops and was quite disappointed to see that my bag of beans only had 3 flavors of jelly beans, none of which are appealing. It seems as though the worst flavors were chosen and sold for a discount price. I love Jelly Bellys, but this was not my best experience with them."
2,Few and wrong flavors :(,"my experience was the same as Kind of Bummed's. there were just a few flavors, none of which i liked. i begged for a bag that had certain flavors...hoping. not one was in there. gave them away. guess you have to be there. no shipping problems tho."
2,Too Bad,We all love your beans but when I ordered 3 bags of flops around Easter they were all the same with only four flavors and the flavors weren't good. Too bad I was going to order more
4,Jelly Belly - Belly Flops,"I received the product when expected, in great condition. The Belly Flops are delicious and made a great gift. Jelly Belly, Thank You."
2,Few flavors,"I ordered thinking I would get the normal assortment of Jelly Bellys, just mishapen. It seems that only a handful of flavors have regular accidents and get discarded to the Belly Flop pile. I received about 5 flavors in the entire 2lb bag. They're still good, but not exactly what I expected. I would just as soon buy the normal 2.2lb bag of assorted flavors for twice the price and receive all the flavors."
2,Poor quality control,"Belly Flops are supposed to be misshapen Jelly Bellys, but just as good, as they come from exactly the same production line as ""perfect"" Jelly Bellies. The quality of the flops doesn't seem to be an issue, just the quality of the assortment. The manufacturer doesn't seem, in my opinion, to put much effort in creating a good assortment of flavors, they just bag whatever flops are produced at the time. My two bags of mostly root beer and coffee had only about 200 beans of another flavor. I don't like root beer at all, and only slightly like coffee, so about a pound of each bag went in the trash. This means I paid about $16/pound for what I actually ate. Sometimes you get what you pay for, not what's advertised. What I'd really like to see is Jelly Belly offer quantities of Jelly Bellies and/or Belly Flops in single flavors you could pick. I'd place my order for 5 pounds of licorice now. James salt water taffy does this, why not Jelly belly?"
1,You guys need to think bigger,I have enjoyed your product for many a year but why send these e mails to people about ordering online knowing full well that they can't. Waste of my time and yours. If you dont send to NZ then remove us from the selection of countries in the account set up. You guys haven't thought this through have you. Nice beans but not worth the hassel. Im never buying your product again.
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a variety of jelly bellies and bought 2 bags thinking that would give even greater variety. There were only a few flavors and both bags were the same. They were not flavors I like or would ever buy.If you like every flavor of Jelly belly the same, this may work for you. Otherwise, you get what you pay for!"
3,Mixed bag,These are a great value if you don't care what flavors you get. I bought 4 bags: 1 was almost entirely licorice; 2 others primarily sours. Fun to eat the different shapes but be aware that the flavors may not be to your taste.
4,Belly Flops- Yummy,"Very excited when I received a big bag of candy for very little money. I'm kind of used to being able to look at the bag to see what type of jelly bean I'm eating, but it was neat to be able to figure it out on my own."
1,NOT A REVIEW OF THE CONTENT OF THE BOOK!,"I have to reiterate, this is not a review of the book in question. This is a review of the decision to wait until AUGUST of 2011 to release this book on Kindle. I just watched ""Public Speaking"" on HBO. Why would we have to wait almost a full year after this film's release to get a book published in 1994 as an eBook? Can someone please explain this to me?"
1,Fran is the President of her own fan club,"She aspires to be a wit and satirist on the level of Oscar Wilde and Dorothy Parker. She is not. She is not witty, astute or pithy. Save your money and your time."
1,Awful,"What a bore! Fran is not funny. One quickly tires of her self-centered view of the world. I'm sure she may find herself humorous, but to the rest of us, let's look elsewhere."
4,Very funny and nostalgic ...,... if you happened to live in Manhattan mid 70s - mid 80s. If you did you've probably read all of these pieces but it's a treat to read them again. If you didn't some of this may not tickle you as much but Lebowitz is as sharp an observer and terse a wit as anyone.
1,Damaged in shipment,"Can was broken in shipment, it was protected with one layer of bubblewrap in the big box with few pieces of loose wrinkled brown paper.11 pound can bounced inside the box and cover broke loose.It took me 2 calls to arrange the replacement, then replacement was cancelled because item became ""out of stock"", and I had to call again today to get the refund for original order because Amazon had no record why there was a second order for Lingonberries. It is really strange because after contacting them I received confirmation e-mails each time. I am giving up on this item, it is not worth the trouble."
3,Not Berle's Best,"This is the first program of the seventh year and is sponsored by Buick. Although it is a sometimes amusing comedy between Berle and Andy Rooney it is not a good example of what the Berle show was all about. No Texaco men, no wild entry, no variety of acts. This is not an example of Berle at his zany best."
5,Holy Hour of Reparation to the Sacred Heart of Jesus,"This Holy Hour of Reparation is a very meaningful prayer and reflection that includes the rosary. I have purchased copies for our Catholic Adoration Chapel, as well as for a Community of women Religious, who pray the Holy Hour for peace and reparation. In the midst of the tragedies of the world, this prayer will bring an oasis of peace. Truly, a wonderful prayer for one or many."
2,What editor? Infuriating!,I bet the author is a great guy and a fine teacher. I think that his book is full of distracting grammatical errors. And what is the point of recording every stupid remark that somebody made in class? I bought this book because I need help in learning VB/VBA; I'm back in the market for a decent book. I give two stars to this book because the author seems knowledgeable and offers some good ideas. The missing stars are for the missing editor.
2,Approximately Educational,"Perhaps the title should be: For Absolute Absolute Absolute Beginners. I found the stride of this book too slow. The narrative of each student was laborious for me. I'm not to sure I like the way the book was written (like a story), partly because I've used VB6 at a friends house. Smiley intended to have every question answered as you where thinking about it, but for me that only happened 1 time when Linda (smartest person in class) asked something. I guess I just expected to be the only person in the class, but Smiley had to tend to people of various IQ levels, so, many of my complex (Linda) questions where left unanswered.The missing stars are for the Quotation Marks, that should have been Question Marks, but where left out due to Classroom over crowding."
1,Begginer ONLY!,"I think this book is stupid! If you ever tried to Program with anything, or even tried reading a book about programing, you will be annoyed to no end by this book."
2,I wouldn't recommend,"I thought to have an expensive fry pan might save money than changing cheap teffal pan everytime it got stuck. Guess what! Foods get stuck to this pan so easily, I would have thrown it away if it was a cheap one. I wouldn't recommend it to others. I've been using this for two months."
5,Sugar Cubes,Found these wonderful little sugar cubes in a coffee house years ago and my wife and I enjoyed them so much so that we needed to get our own supply. These are not only great with coffee but with hot tea as well and they sweeten the drink just right.
3,Minding the Explanatory Gap,"In virtuoso fashion, culled by sullied verbosity of quintessential qualia paraded back and forth on tuesdays, the mind-brain link is here defined in what philosophers call ""reductio grand piano"" fashion. It's true that opiate receptors dance across cell walls with benzos in mind, forlorn of hope and ordering burgers at the local Ground Round, but where does this figure in the Chinese Room Argument that Searle keeps tossing about the battlefields of Kosovo just to attract attention? If Dennett could fly paper airplanes from the lecturn and bean his snoring grad students, would he? And would we not, therefore, be entitled to explore the neurophysiological link, say, the action potential/consciousness highway, and muddy it with rivers of synaptic conflation? I suppose we could, but I would recommend you follow this tome up with Searle's paper cup phantoms to see if the brain is just another machine or really a very smartly concealed bowl of potato chips."
1,Not at all fun,"Super boring. Not gross. No nudity. No coherent plot. No wonder this sat on a shelf for so long. It completely and totally sucks. Choppy watered-down mess. Do not pay more than .99 for this film. It's awful. Makes ""The Boogeyman"" or ""When a Stranger Calls (remake)"" look like award-winning cinema. Cute girls but not worth your nearly 90 mins. Avoid at all costs. Totally misleading box and ads. It's a bust!"
3,"2 CDs Totalling 36 Songs, Maybe Should Have Been 1 CD.","It's a great idea to have a 2 CD focuing on West Coast music, with the title track Take It Easy being a sure fire winner, here sung by Jackson Brown.Other fantastic stuff is:Don't Stop. Fleetwood Mac.Long Train Runnin' Doobie Brothers.On The Road Again. Canned Heat.For What It's Worth. Buffalo Springfield.It's So Easy. Linda Ronstadt.Lonely Boy. Andrew Gold.A Horse With No Name. America.Guitar Man. Bread.Good Vibrations. Beach Boys.Alone Again Or. Love.White Rabbit. Jefferson Airplane.Return Of The Grievous Angel. Gram Parsons.Get Together. The Youngbloods.To be honest I/m not such a fan of The Grateful Dead, Ry Cooder, Hall And Oats, Donald Fagen and others featured here.So without doubt enough for a 5 star 1 CD, but not enough for a 2 CD.PS Not helped by no Byrds, Eagles or Neil Young."
4,Very catchy,"The first time I heard ""Cuckoo!"" and especially ""Little Lamb,"" I never thought I'd buy this album. The vocals were different and borderline annoying, but after a few more listens the hooks pulled me in and never let go.That is what makes this album great, super catchy songs that grab you and don't let go - that is, for a while, at least. The ""replay value"" of the music is not so high. I find myself skipping the songs more often these days when they pop up on a mix. But there are definitely songs worth buying on this album and I suggest it to anyone looking for something refreshing and interesting."
4,suprise,"Good approach: listen first, find your stories, present them, etc. The book is easy to read and full of stimulating material and examples."
3,Not as good as the self-titled album,"I liked this OK, but I think NFG's self-titled CD blows it out of the water. Could have been a lot better, but ""Hit or Miss"", ""3rd and Long"", and ""2's and 3's"" are great. The rest of the CD is kinda...I dunno...not good."
3,good information; great IPA reference,"I felt that this book was a really good introductory phonetics text book. I've used it as a good standard for phonetic transcription over the past few years as an SLP student. It's a great reference, although it is a little dry."
1,"burt scores as a set-up cop,but this turkey needs more help","i have to say i think burt looks good here and is very good as the hard drinking cop,it's just that the rest of the movie is so bad that burt's acting gets lost!a sleeze ball crook is found dead(in a most origanl way,the only other good thing in the movie) and everything points to burt. theresa russell(lost and very poor as a lawyer) takes his case and they set out to find the killer. michael crichton directs this mess with out any real fire except for the opening scenes. and yet another nail in the coffin of burt's career!!"
5,all terain,"The tires are really good, its my second time buying them,,you get better stopping response from it..an they give your bike a nice old school look...thumbs-up.."
1,Go with the editor's review!!,"After reading the editor's review I was ready to dismiss this movie even as a huge Buffy / Angel / Bones fan. Then I read all the other reviews and reconsidered. Editors often pan movies I end up liking, so I thought I'd try it. I'm actually somewhat surprised that I didn't just give up halfway through. This movie was terrible. The plot was idiotic, the three girls annoying, and it wasn't worth watching even to just see David on the screen. Go with the editor's review and stay away - especially if your a Boreanaz fan! What bet did he lose to be forced to do this role?!?!"
1,"Um, silly.","I only bought this movie because I am a DB fan but this was just a low budget movie and it shows. The plot could of been funny but just wasnt to me - maybe because I found all the acting painful. You do get to see DB's tush so if that is what your after you will like that part of it. Otherwise, this was not a good movie at all. So glad I bought it used for a few bucks."
2,Unplayable,"It is hard to imagine why this game runs so poorly on a modern Pentium 4 computer. Despite its unimpressive and blocky graphics, it can't seem to draw images fast enough to keep up with what very little action exists.But there's a bigger problem. It's absolutely boring. Too slow moving for a building sim. Too little activity for a business sim. Airport Tycoon 3 is the kind of cheaply made, bottom of the discount bin item that you'll regret hogging up space on your disk drive.Once you have built your airport, you have a choice of altering the speed of the game between horrifically slow real-time and annoyingly zippy fast mode. But neither of them give you much satisfaction. In fast mode, planes land and take off so quickly you miss them in the blink of an eye. Try to slow it down, and you sit around and wait forever for something -- anything -- to happen.Ultimately, this is among the least playable of the simulation games."
5,Don't listen to the other one-star reveiws!,"You really should buy this game. [...] This game is alot better than the other two Airport tycoons. The people writing the reveiws simply thought it would be WAY better than the other ones, so when they saw that the game was not as much better than the other Airport tycoons as they thought it would be,[...]"
1,Not Worth,This game is not worth the money spend.. I tried to play this a couple of time but found unsatisfactory
1,BAD,"Do not buy this game. It is boring, unrealistic, stupid, and uncreative. Totally not thrilling. Terrible. Don't waste your hard-earned money."
1,Make sure your computer fits standards.,"This game seemed like it would be really really great, if only it worked. My computer, being slightly older than up-to-date, did not let me play the game. The 'video card' thingy was not the right format to run this game. So before you buy this game, make sure your video card fits the standards. Otherwise, you'll waste 20 bucks like I did."
5,last one..,"that's the last M.Franks CD i needed to get ... Now I have all of them... Do You really need any other comments ?...P.S. I start my M.Franks collection back in Ukraine,where 1 CD is 1/3 of typical monthly salary...I had 5 of them there... His poetry and music is OUTstanding/standing far out of line/ and totally UNIQUE. Enjoy !"
1,Very poor.,"Listeners (more importantly, purchasers) BEWARE: these are not original recordings! And, while it may sound like the original bandmembers singing karaoke to their own hits it is nowhere as good as it seems."
3,needs more info in synopsis,"i like the cd ok, but i should have been told this has re-recorded songs and not all songs are by the original group."
5,intense book,This is an intense book to read.. Just to know somne of what our people went through. We did have fast shipping and that was great.
4,"no limits, no censorship","Its a simple, yet eloquent book. Its beginning is a little slow, but makes up for it throughout the book. The stories throught the book give the chilling details and dont hold any punches. You want a short version of Vietnam and its realities, read this book. If not, then read it anyway. Good book."
4,not only inspiring but exciting from =go to whoa,This book really paints a great picture a a guy who is born into service. From the start you can see how driven he is and the test he endures both to get into the various special units and once within them are truly amazing.A thoroughly enjoyable read that gives you that 'wish you where there feeling'
5,Finally!,"I can't describe the feeling I got when I heard the debut of ""It's Alright Now"" on the radio. Ever since his first album, I'll buy any cd Rahsaan is on. I think he has an incredible style and I just love his voice. I have to admit when I first heard the second album, I didn't think it was good as the first, BUT.......IT IS! I think it's a different tone to this album, still funky though. I highly recommend this album. If he is ever in town check him out. He is an excellent vocalist and he sounds excatly like his CD's if not better."
3,"OK, SO I GOT SPOILED!","Sue me. My expectations were high after his debut and that's unfair to this cat.I liked it it though. I vibed it. I bumped it. Still do. Is he still the best kept secret in neo soul? YOU BET YOUR SWEET CD CHANGER HE IS! I liked when he paid respect to sistas with 'TREAT YOU LIKE A QUEEN'. Nice. 'IT'S ALRIGHT NOW' sounds like a cut from Chante Moore. 'FRIEND OF MINE' is a Stevie cut if I ever heard one! The infectious shoulder sway of 'IT AINT LOVE' always gets me lookin' funny in the car. But the hit of the CD for me is 'THE MOMENT'! Dayum! Lettin' 'em know it ain't all about the hit-it-and-quit-it vibe so often discussed in the R&B/Hip-Hop circles.So yeah, I wanted a part 2 to his debut CD, but this is still chillin' in one of those slots in the Kenwood system changer at my lil bourgie get-togethers. (wink!)"
4,Good addition to old computer,I have an old computer that I wanted to upgrade the graphics card on. A Dell 4500S. Went right in and now I can play Rome Total War.
2,Don't waste your money,This extract did not decrease my appetite. If anything it increased my appetite. Don't wasteyour money.
4,From a Satisfied Customer,"I at first, like so many before me have stated, was weary of this new CD when I first began to listen to it. The band seems to get in a rut with continuously playing the typical love songs, but soon each song takes on a life of its own. ""Stumble"" stands out for its outstanding harmony, ""Automatic"" is just enjoyable, and ""Wonderland"" is just exceptionally beautiful. For any person looking for a new hard alternative group may not enjoy this album, but I still find myself drawn to the singer's gorgeous voice and the memorable songs."
5,Worth A Long Listen,"Collapsis was Mike Garrigan's band prior to his joining Athenaeum, and the two bands sounds are complementary, but this cd has slightly more edge than the other band and really showcases Garrigan's melodic grasp. The cd is routinely strong, all the songs show nice development and structure. ""Automatic"" got quite a bit of attention when the cd came out and was a college-radio favorite; it's a great opening tune. ""October"" is almost anthemic, heard Mike sing it with Athenaeum live and was just blown away. IMHO it's the best song. ""Dirty Wake"" is sinister in the verses yet hooks the listener with a well-resolved chorus; top notch stuff! If you can find this cd, grab it."
3,Interesting for a fan of the game,"Just short and to the point...this was an interesting book that covered topics like how players prepare for the combine, how teams scout players, how agents pursue draftees, etc. Unfortunately, the book was marred somewhat by less than perfect writing. There were spots where you felt like you were reading the same material over again, and other spots, such as the ""Draft Day"" chapter, where the author bounced between characters so much it was hard to follow. Don't read this looking for a literary masterpiece, but do pick it up if you are a true fan of the sport...just feel free to skim at a few points."
5,Great book at a Greater Bargain!,I purchased this book for my boyfriend who is an attorney trying to become a sports agent. He loves the book!! Thank you so much.
3,Label Difficult to Remove,Label Difficult to Remove. Nice enough product for the cheap price. Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
3,could be better,"When it works, it works nicely. But the reception is good for FM, but the AM, is bad if your trying to reach a distant station, sadly, I wanted to reach a distant station (one) i can reach with my stardard radio, but could get absoultly nothing from the shark fin, trying every location possible..."
4,Works Well For Me,"I bought the RadioShark2 to record local AM and FM stations to keep track of local business and political news. I am within 4 miles of the transmitter locations and I great reception for both AM and FM stations. (I am only comparing the audio quality for spoken word recordings since that was my requirement when I bought them). The software in general words well. It allows time-shifting recordings and DVR like replay. I am using the Macintosh version. The only reason for one less star is because the software sometimes does not change the station correctly (rarely) or have the ability to wake the computer for a timed recording. The latter has a work around by using OSX preferences to wake the computer before the recording time. The unit has a blue light when there is USB power and changes to red when you are recoding a station. I would highly recommend the for anyone that wants to record, time-shift, or DVR like replay the radio airways."
2,Warning,This product works in with Windows XP ONLY! Do not buy if you have Windows Vista or Window 7!!!!!!! The setup for Windows XP is very particular to SP2. I updated my Windows XP SP2 to SP 3 and the junk software that comes with this thing quit working!! Don't but this thing!!!!!
4,Works great for the one station I wanted to record.,"I read the reviews and saw that a lot of people said the AM reception was terrible, but really wanted to give it a try. I'm glad that I did, because it captures the one AM talk radio station that I wanted to record. That seems to be the only station that it gets, but since it is the only one I want to record, I've very happy. I now have it set to record all my weekly and daily programs so that I can listen to them when I want to, and pause when I get a phone call or something. This also lets me skip the repetitive news/commercials that are at the same times each day (easy to skip forward a few minutes). And one of the best features is that sometimes I'm half listening and hear the end of something, I can roll back a few minutes and see what I missed. If the reception was more comparable to a standard AM/FM radio, this would definitely be 5 stars."
2,RadioShark2,"Product does not work with Windows Vista. I opened a ticket with Griffin, Case: AFV-20522-844 on 26 Dec 2007. I received a prompt (automated) response with case number. The case asks if Griffin would offer a download update for Windows Vista... As of 12 Jan 2008, I have had no further contact by Griffin. I went to Griffin's website on 12 Jan and could find no way to inquire on my case, short of submitting another question.If/when Griffin responds, I will update this review."
3,Highlighters,Not much to say here as highlighters are pretty much highlighters. The count and color was correct si I would say good job.
4,Small precise highlighting,I like these because they are small highlighters. I kind of with that it would have said something in the description though.
5,Perfect Highlighter Pack,"I still like to use hard copy books and manuals and having a highlighter handy makes for easy review and study later.This is the perfect pack of highlighters. Five different colors is more than enough unless you are trying to make all your pages look like a 60's psychedelic dream.I know yellow is considered to be the essential highlighter color and some of the other packs come with extra yellow highlighters, but I find that I use orange the most so this multi pack works great for me, I don't end up with a bunch of extra yellow pens laying around.The ""Chisel-Tip"" highlighters are the easiest to use. It allows you to use the broad side to highlight full blocks of text or turn the pen 90 degrees to use the fine edge to underline text or long passages.They are just highlighters... But this is my favorite pack of them..."
2,"Cheap, poor quality","The yellow is fine, but the remaining colors are pretty cheap. The orange is a bit too dark to be called a highlighter, more like crossing something out with an orange pen. For the price I paid, I guess its OK. Sharpe highlighers are a bit higher quality."
3,Run out quick,"This is cheap highlighter, but it runs out pretty quick. Also, it's cheap if you buy them at Walmart stores."
2,"Bleeds through paper, too dark to be considered a ""highlighter""","I bought this for the colors other than yellow. The pink and blue pens are okay, but the green and orange (the colors I actually wanted and bought this pack for) are way too dark. They bleed through standard printer paper and notebook pages and make the other side of the page a mess, and also make it difficult to read the highlighted words. Wouldn't recommend this for people who actually want to be able to read what they highlight, or keep notes neat and tidy."
2,Way too fast for beginners,"I think this would be an okay video if it weren't listed as volume 1. If I knew what I was doing and had a good foundation, I might have been able to keep up with this one. The instruction isn't all that thorough and though the instructors dance well, I wasn't impressed with this video as a teaching tool. I'd recommend starting somewhere else if you are new to Two-Step."
5,This Is the Textbook version of Corprate Fraud,This book is excellent and very readable. It is the textbook version of Corporate Fraud Handbook: Prevention and Detection by the same author which costs less. So unless you are using this in class or teach from it get the Corporate Fraud Handbook...it costs less. Either way you won't be sorry for having the book. It is worth it.
1,Save your money.,"The book is incredibly dry, seems she spends more time cutting and pasting sources than actually putting any of her own thoughts into the book. If you want to get the good stuff out of this book, go to the library and read chapters four and five.Avoid reading anything else unless you have nothing but time on your hands. I was very upset that she fails to turn an accusing eye on her own secret society - hypocrite.You can thank me for saving you 15 bucks now."
2,Skull and Bones ala Peggy Lee : Is That All There Is?,"If Skull and Bones is truly THAT anti-climactic a triumph, why do students want to join? The Club seems a big elite snooze,complete with intellectual hijincks and hi-brow cutting up that only those in-the-know could relish. Even Eulogia would fall asleep enduring the banal revels of the ""Future Stuffed Shirts of America Club."" I finished the book feeling that a lot of REAL inside information MUST have been omitted.I ask you---of Skull and Bones,is that truly ALL THERE IS??????"
1,POORLY EDITED,"POORLY EDITED. The writer clearly did her research, but, like other reviewers, I ended up skipping whole sections and skimming others, hoping to get the the ""good stuff."" This book could have been a FASCINATING 50-75 pages, but as it stands, it's 208 pages of draft research.Again, not the author's fault. The editor was asleep at the switch."
3,A total let down,"This is reminicent of every post-Slapstick band: they matured (read: they stopped playing ska and started playing power-pop with horns and some ska influence).It's hard to judge, in a way, though, as Before You Knew Better was probably the best ska album released in the 2000s.For a die hard SKA fan, this can probable be passed on. For an Edna's Goldfish fan, definitely go fro it."
4,Great storage place!,"This toy is a great storage place! The only problem so far I have had is that this toy is crammed with clothes, and I sometimes I can't open or shut it, (I have TONS of polly clothes!) So I wish there was more space. But if you are looking for a small storage place to keep your polly clothes I would suggest this toy; if you have TONS of clothes like me, I would suggest something bigger!"
2,I don't know about this one...,My daughter was excited about this toy but it is soooo slow on the computer that she quickly got bored and moved onto something else. I took it up just to see if she was doing something wrong but it was slow with me too. I takes forever to load and all the graphics don't show. What a mess. Not what we expected!
3,bratz that was not a big hit,my niece had this at the top of her list 3 or 4 years ago. she was only able to play with it a handfull of times. it is basically an over priced bratz doll. if you are buying it just for the doll it is a good value. i would not purchase this again.
3,I LOVE TONEDEFF BUT....,"...but he could've done better. don't get me wrong,i'm not saying this album is wack,but the production is shaky in places. it might be because he did a lot of the production hisself. if he left the production to kno(from cunninlynguists)the album would've been excellent. lyrical tonedeff is almost flawless,but some of his concepts should've been a bit more thought out.plus he has ""fillers"" throughout the album.songs like ""pervert"" could've & should've been left off.if you're the type person that listens to hip hop for lyrics you should check this album out,but if you only listen for beats this might not be for you.stand out tracks are ""quoteables"" & ""heavyweight""."
5,My favorite new album!,"I was really looking forward to this album - swing music is what my life is all about. When not practicing swing dancing with my buddies, I spend all my free time collecting vintage clothing and spectator shoes. So I was waiting outside the record store to buy this the day it went on sale. When the store opened, I ran in, put my money down, ran home and played it. And I haven't stopped listening since! Maybe some day I can be in a swing band as cool as BBVD, but until then, I'll just dream about them every night and wish I was in the band, too! BBVD, I love you!"
3,"Not bad, their first was better","Sorry, BBVD, but I enjoyed your first release more than your sophomore effort. ""This Beautiful Life"" would have been better received if not for the standard set by their eponymous debut."
3,Well... NO!,"Yes! A new swing album is out, but this one can't even compare to the original wave of swing that graced the world last year. Having seen BBVD in concert, I knew that the next album wouldn't come close, because (although the concert was incredible) all the songs that weren't on the original record were mediocre at best, which describes their new CD. With a few good moments on the record, I think that BBVD had trouble finding original material for the low-tom swing they perfected in their debut album. Cudos to Karl Hunter and his wailing sax, but boos to the boring slow tracks!"
5,A great representation of the Grateful Dead's many years!,"This is an amazing album. If you are expecting a best of...u will not find it here, because that is not what this album is all about. It is a small portion/representation of their career, and their path along the long, winding road if musical experience. I think it almost takes a DeadHead to appreciate what this CD is all about. It's also great because it is all previously unreleased tracks, which makes for a NEW and interesting experience. I give this five stars, and more if i could. If you are looking for a good addition to your Dead collection, this is the album for you."
3,Quantiy does not always equal quality,"There are some outstanding moments in this collection, as have been pointed out by others (Watkins Glen, So Many Roads), but there are also some low points to this as well (Bird Song, vocals on The Wheel). It also skips over some of the Dead's finer material (acoustic renditions, Going Down the Road, Wharf Rat). With so much material the producers could have chosen from, why did they allow any version of a song on this collection with weak, off key vocals? It's not like they sang that way every night. IMHO, the best is somewhere else (American Beauty, Workingman's Dead, Hundred Year Hall, Skull and Roses (Greatful Dead Live)). If you are a collector of GD music, though, you should not pass this up, since it does have it's shining moments."
1,Not Zesty,"The Dead's music did change over the years. If you want a sampling of their music from each period, here you go. I think there are better CDs to have in your collection: studio efforts, Dick's Picks, and the various other compilations, such as Phil Zone.The booklet that comes with the boxed set uses a type size that makes it difficult to read, not that it matters because it's just essays from music critics. The pictures are nice, though.I was disappointed with So Many Roads. ...."
4,Works for me ...,"I think I may have read this years ago but I stumbled on it recently and bought it again. Glasser is a good writer and obviously a great therapist. The premise of the book is that those with problems that we call mental illness, in most cases, are problems of responsibility.In some cases that might be a tough pill but overall there would seem to be a lot of truth to his findings, which he details from actual work in mental institutions along the way. The idea of taking responsibility for fulfilling our needs, which he describes as to love and be loved and to I think he says feel important ... certainly one can see in the business world playing out.So overall I liked the book and philosophy, probably not 100% applicable, but worth the read and understanding."
2,Things Have Really Changed Since 1965!,"Reality Therapy might have been ""revolutionary"" back in 1965 when this book was written, but now it just feels old and dated. ""Psychiatry Then and Now"" or ""Where Dr. Phil Got His Ideas"" would be better titles for 21st century readers.Unless you enjoy reading about a time when homosexuals were lumped in with pedophiles as deviants, and electroshock therapy and induced insulin comas were used to ""treat"" WWII veterans with PTSD, don't waste your money on this book."
3,Where is the freaking answer section?,"Practice books for summer study are great, but without an answer guide, this well constructed book has dubious value. Several exercises provoked disagreement between three college educated teachers who reviewed the book with me as to the best possible answer. There not even a web citation of where teachers can procure answers."
5,Ordered it for school,"I was required to order this for my 9th grade English class and it's been really good with giving new, challenging words and enough exercises to practice them with."
2,The Content was not what I expected,"I read about two chapters and tossed it; as it was not what I expected or wanted. It did not tell my very much at all about compassion, although that is the title of the book. Its just another Far East book that said little of interest to me."
3,There is a disconnect...,"between what was advertised, and what showed up. The book itself was old; I am thinking perhaps the seller got a discontinued library copy, peeled the dust jacket off, and posted it up on Amazon. But that's cool; it was in good condition, so I'm fine with that.I think there are some interesting nuggets of information in here--the book was written by a farming organization, and puts some time into discussion the proper season for harvesting and eating vegetables, as well as hints for what indicates their optimum flavor.However, I would say at least 50% of the recipes in here consist of putting the veggies in a casserole dish with ""processed cheese food,"" bread crumbs, and an egg, and baking for 30 minutes. I like cheese, and I like easy recipes, but that's not really hunreds of ways to enjoy vegetables.Also, if you have food sensitivities to gluten, wheat, dairy, or eggs, just keep moving--3/4 of these recipes will be useless to you."
4,Walls Blizard-Pruf Bibs,My husband loves these bibs. Very warm and the slippery lining doesn't stick to the long underwear! He wears them daily to the barn. They wash fine and the fit is exact. A bit pricey but every bit as good as Carharts!
5,Awesome Amazon Purchase,Ordered these insulated bibs for my husband for Christmas. They are a perfect fit! Awesome price and super fast shipping. Very good quality too! Thank you for making my holiday shopping easy!
3,good for the price,The knee pads were too low to align with my knee unless i pulled the leg up everytime i went down on my knee. Other than that they were great. I bought some uninsulated ones and they have the same problem. Maby my knee is in the wrong place.
3,"Could have been five stars, but they made two big mistakes","Black Mirror has a fascinating story, fair to good graphics, a wonderfully creepy atmosphere, and some fun, challenging puzzles. Unfortunately, the designers made two very big mistakes. First, they included several points at which you must wait a set amount of time for an NPC to perform a certain task in order for the story to advance, which often means a lot of walking around with nothing to do while you wait for the alloted number of minutes to tick off. Second, and most importantly, they gave the game a horribly rushed and incoherent ending. This last flaw is especially annoying, as a good mystery absolutely must have a good ending--one that ties all threads together and leaves everything satisfactorily explained. When you finally learn the identity of the murderer, your head is swimming with questions that never get answered, and you're ultimately left with a very bad taste in your mouth."
3,"Good, but too much talk","Im all for a well made story incorporated into a game, heck it's practically a requirement for adventure games to have, but what I cannot tolerate is designers insistence on shoving 10 minutes of plot down the players throat followed by an hour of gameplay, and then repeating the process..While Black Mirror doesnt neccesarily exploit that concept, their detatchment from gameplay to plot is noticeable, giving players too many gaps between learning of the story, and experiencing it..Having said that, this game has a nice dark atmosphere to it, plenty of beautiful artwork, and will keep you playing for a long time if you are willing to enjoy it to the end.."
1,Sounds better then it is,"I started playing the game, it seemed to me like it was dragging on and I got bored, with the storyline. There was nothing to keep me interested in this game."
1,The Black Mirror,"I hope I speak for others as well as myself. We are tired of having to repeat things over and over in our games before we can go forward in the game.! This really takes away the whole mood of the game.Once or twice to ask questions is enough times,anything more you have lost the mood again. There is no need to touch everything to continue on,why do you do this ? I was so disapointed after waiting so long for this game. The upside is, the special effects are wonderful,the rain and thunder are like you are there. The locations are beautiful."
5,Great product,Worked great.Will purchase again!!The product was advertised correctly and instructions were very easy to follow.This product deserves a five star rating.
3,sort of works,This Ortho insect killer works but here's the problem- it doesn't work on worms where it's most important. My tomatoes look like they've been through a war zone with nothing able to provide medical assistance thanks to this products inability to eliminate them. This Ortho killer works great for ants and flies however. My pepper plants are beautiful and more productive than ever as a result of this product. The worms however... they get worse every year. They will completely destroy a vegetable garden. Keep this in mind. Oh and don't sprinkle any on before a rainstorm. That's a pretty big mistake since it'll just wash off.
1,Skip This One...,"Ditto the opinion of prior reviewers, do not support a convicted murderess by purchasing this book. Liysa Northson literally got away with MURDER. She is alive and Chris Northson is DEAD. Do not put money in her pocket!"
1,Should be retitled 'I am a Pathological Lying Murderer',"All profits from this book should go to help those who are killed by pathological, devious, scheming murderers like Liysa 'the liar' King!!!!!!"
2,Reads like a first draft,"I will confess that part of the reason Ms. Shea's writing style bothers me so much is that it reminds me of my own...at least before I get down to the serious business of revising and editing, which she seems to have skipped. Her intelligence and energy do shine through, but she goes off on long, book-reportish tangents about nearly every title she comes across (and she works in a bookstore, remember), without even going into more depth than the back cover blurbs. There is no logical organization or progression of ideas, personalities or events; it's a lot like listening to random breakroom chatter. News flash; it's not so very uncommon for authors to work (or to have worked) in bookstores. This type of environment draws literary types. She acts like she's the sole human being ever to have attempted such a groundbreaking step. Get over yourself."
1,Boring,"When I came across this book in my favorite charming, independent bookstore, I bought it immediately. It sounded totally enjoyable to me because I love books, I love bookstores, and I've read a fictional book by this author (SELLING THE LITE OF HEAVEN) which was delightful. Unfortunately this book is not nearly as interesting as the back cover and after about 30 pages of total boredom I gave up and put it in my ""Books To Be Donated"" bag."
4,Solid and Simple,"Great little book.A well rounded overview of flowering cacti including their care, tips, history, origin and pics.Definitely a Cacti 101 book that can used by all."
2,Ska not punk,"If you like ska, this might be a record for you. If you like punk rock, be advised that there is nothing like that on this record."
5,a Rancid Fan,"I've been waiting months for this album. I got it the first day it came out and I'm very impressed with it. You never really know what to expect from the Rancid crew because every new album is different and fresh, but always good. Tim Armstrong is very creative and it shows here. This is Ska/Reggae with an two-tone groove. If you like most Rancid albums you'll probably like this. One great thing about Armstrong is his amazing ability to write lyrics. And this album has some good ones, especially track 9 ""Among the Dead"" is about his time with Ska/Punk Pioneers Operation Ivy. And things that happened after they broke up. Anyway great music, great lyrics from a very talented individual. This is an A+ album and I've been waiting for the Rancid crew to come up with something like this for a while now and I'm very Pleased. Highly recommended."
1,Misleading photo,Why do they show a single pair of drumsticks when the photo shows two pairs? Buy something else.
1,"Very superficial, No continuity. Too Expensive.","The author did not seem to spend much time at all writing the book. The chapters are not organized, information are provided here and there with no organization or glue to hold them together. Chapters are totally randomly ordered. For its price it is not worth it."
4,One of the best books by missed author Harold Robbins,"When I discovered the books by Harold Robbins I joined a world unlike any other I've seen till then. The world of bussiness, fame, fortune, losing everything, the dealing with the defeat, sex, sex, sex. At first sight, I was mesmerized and shocked with such books. Reading them I learned things I'd never even imagined. And when I started reading THE PREDATORS, I knew the real Harold Robbins. It's a book full of emotions, feelings and the odds of these things. Of course, with more sex than in any other of his books. If you like that kind of books, read this one. THE PREDATORS is the kind of book you should read on a Sunday afternoon, when you have time to enjoy yourself and have nothing much else to do except have fun. Nothing's perfect, and this book is not, 'cause the end lacks a little in criativity. But who cares when all your main reason to read these books is have fun?"
3,A Crude Stew of Sex & Money,"Within the first few pages of Harold Robbins's latest and final novel -- completed shortly before his death -- his hero, Jerry Cooper, has lost both parents in a car wreck and has had a steamy sexual encounter with a girl downstairs.The Predators keeps up this breathless pace, tracking Cooper from Manhattan, where he works for his uncle, a small-time crook, to Paris during World War II. There, Cooper gets involved with a Corsican gangster who traffics in smuggled cars. Robbins doesn't waste time on niceties of style or subtleties of characterization as he follows Cooper's rise to power and respect-ability.There's something quaintly old-fashioned about this no-frills potboiler and something distasteful in its tired, one-dimensional takes on homosexuals, African-Americans and endlessly compliant women."
2,Extremely disappointed,"If you're looking for a book to teach the basics of trading options and futures, this one might do you. Of course, for that purpose, it's about $50 overpriced. If you're wanting to learn more about the fundamentals of evaluating energy markets, this book really has absolutely nothing to say. Don't be fooled by the title."
1,The authors were totally clueless,"You can definitely find a better book on commodity deriatives than this one. As far as trading energy futures & options, these guys were totally clueless."
4,as shown,I am happy with the copy I received. It is never easyto find an excellent older book due to bindingintegrity. This book was very good.
5,Elegance at your fingertips,"I originally wanted a Mont Blanc, thinking they were the best. I took a trip to a store selling luxury pens and tried several out. I was drawn to the style of the Waterman Carene line - its beautiful 'marble' texture and sleek lines. Well, one quick sample on a memopad and I was sold. The ink flows on paper like velvet. If you prefer a weightier pen, this is the one for you. By the way, the color of the Amber Shimmer Rollerball Pen is not maroon, as advertised. It really is amber and actually resembles tortoiseshell. One recommendation: check first with the vendor, Goldspot Pens, to make sure these pens are indeed in stock."
3,Ok,Kindle version doesn't allow for pictures to be viewed. Made some areas more difficult to follow. Nothing too exciting in the book but was a decent read.
4,Very Interesting Period Read,"I've always loved and been fascinated by Lord Baden-Powell, so when the opportunity presented itself to read his work I jumped. Next to his biography 'The Two Lives of a Hero' by William Hillcourt, this is the best biographical work on Lord Baden-Powell I've read. It's a quick read with a plethora of information and real life examples. It's amazing how much spy work has both changed and stayed the same"
1,Couple Solid Whacks... Tool was bent and in the garbage,I tried to use this tool to remove the ball-ends on my 94 BMW 325.. Not a very big car and destroyed the appropriate size pickle head with about a dozen hits with a 3 lb hammer... The pickle head angles were funky and the tool bent before releasing my ball joints. The head looks more like a doorstop than a wedge like the better tools.The thing came loose and had to be re-tightened every other hit or so.. The screw-in head is just a bad idea for a tool you hit with a hammer.I had to run to the parts store to buy a single-piece replacement to complete my work.Save your money and buy the more expensive single purpose tool
1,Listen and Learn Russian,I was very disappointed in this CD. It is so hard to understand the tranlators voice. He pronounces his Russian in a very difficult manner.
2,Oreck Restaurateur for home use,The Oreck Restaurateur sweeper did not pick up the sand and small pieces of dirt from either the wood floors or the carpet. Our yard is natural with pine needles and we have a sandy beach on a lake; sand and small pieces of needles and soil are often tracked in even with door mats. I had hoped the sweeper would be a quick fix to the problem.
3,SLEESTAKS ON THE LOOSE!,"THIS POOR MOVIE HAS TWO THINGS GOING FOR IT. THE CREATURE SUITS, AND THE SHOWER SCENE.The rest is pretty forgetable. There is no story at all,and alot of the scenes were drawn out, with the actors walking as slowly as possible down catwalks,and hallways just to stretch the running time,and when the characters do decide to run, the director switches to slow motion shots????Again probably to stretch the running time, because nothing really happens during this film.But the monsters are scary and fast, and the first few kills do startle a bit, but unless your a die hard creature feature kind of person(like me) you may want to skip this one. And the monsters look alot like sleestaks with teeth!It's not the worst I've seen, but the filmakers should really have worked out a better story."
3,dog treats,"This product is very expensive but my dogs love them. I can get them to do what ever I want as long as they know they are getting these as a reward but then again, I can also use cheap hot dogs with the same results. If you have money to burn, then buy this, if not, stick with store brand hot dogs cut up into small pieces."
3,"Great for travel, but too expensive, too much prep","These are great training treats when you need something lightweight that won't make a mess of your pockets. I have a couple problems with them though. First, they are too expensive for every day training. Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready-to-eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry. Cut it up, put it in small portions, and freeze. My dog likes it better than the freeze-dried anyway. I do a whole bunch at a time so I am not prepping frequently. But I figure if I have to prep something, it might as well be something cheap!"
5,Best treats we've tried so far,My 5 month old lab goes nuts over these liver treats. Our vet recommended these as a healthy treat. Our pup acts like a cat with catnip over these. A big hit. The price and size are excellent and should last a good while.
4,Good all natural treats,My dogs love these treats. The only problems I've encountered with these are the left over powder at the bottom and the sizes are not uniform; many big pieces and many very small pieces (very minor problems). But they are all natural and don't upset my dogs stomachs.
5,Great Dog Treat,"My vet had these on hand for my great Havanese after shots, so I bought them there. He loves them the best of all treats (the second is Bagon strips, also from Amazon). Amazon has several size choices and great prices. I usually break up the pieces as treats are not about quantity but quality, so I recommend keeping the treats small. Great item."
4,Freeze dried liver as dog treats,My little pupster loves these things. She is not exactly Ms. easy to please when it comes to food of any kind. These she thinks are great.Betsy
4,Cut the pieces smaller,"The product is wonderful! It stays clean and dry in your pocket and dogs will obey your every command to get a treat. But, it is very expensive and you are suppose to limit the daily amount, so I cut smaller slices of each cube to make it last longer and give my dog less product each training session."
4,A great yarn about social collapse and the will to survive,"A great yarn about the fate of Kalgash ... a planet with 6 suns, and a civilization that developed in perpetual light.A multi-disciplinary team of scientists (astronomers, archeologists, psychologists, a journalist, etc.) slowly assemble frightening evidence of a recurring calamity that befalls their planet every other millenia ... total darkness.What does it all mean ? How to prepare the public in order to head off mass hysteria ? How to deal with nihilistic religious cultists who, with growing alarm, the scientists realize may have the right of things ? How to handle the media ?It's a great tale about a civilization faced with immanent collapse, the nature of human frailty, and the will to survive.Highly recommended."
5,A great complemento to the short story,"Nightfall was a classic when published as a short story some 50 years ago. Asimov really gave his best then as he did now. Then we read about the psicological disaster that total darkness meant in a wolrd of perpetual daylight. Now we see the facts after the disaster. As the prologue says, ""first you read what happend at nightfall. Now you'll also learn what happens at daybreak"". This book is a must."
5,Brilliant!,"This book is one of the greatest of the Science-Fiction genre. I loved the way the culture so closely resembled human kind, yet how much they differed. This extremely intriguing venture into a complex society kept me reading through the last page."
4,"Good, but not the best he's done","Although a good book, the redundancy of the post-nightfall insanity is nearly unbearable. The interaction between the religionists and scientists was well done, but Asimov has done better."
2,An uneven story.,"The beginning was interesting, the middle was fascinating and the end was a dud. Really, my main problem was the ""madness"" premise. My question is: Why would seeing the stars come out make everyone go insane? (I know, I know...it only happens once every 2049 years...uh...I think my question still stands.) This was simply too unbelievable. The story was basically over for me after that. Which was too bad because the ""Nightfall"" section was as thrilling a page-turner as I have ever read."
4,Oreck OEM bags.,OEM bags not much to say about them but handheld works a lot better now that the bags are changed regularly. These are hard to find in most stores so if not near an Oreck dealer best to get them through here.
2,Very Pretty and Very Loud,"My two month old loves to be rocked to sleep. My husband and I saw the Deluxe Comfort Sway Lounger at Babies R Us and decided to give it a try. Well, turns out it is soooo loud when it ""sways"" back and forth that she couldn't fall asleep in it and she just cries. The noise when it moves or vibrates is louder that the music it plays. I was not very happy by that and neither was my daughter."
3,video,I have recieve the video in good condition and the story is good. It has good scenes. The ending is good with nice animation.
1,Do not buy this......! -Jult Warfell,I gave this series away to a friend. It was not worth a part of my collection of anime. Now if I could only i could get rid of the anime that I wasted time watching. -Jult Warfell
3,MVLS,"I found this book to have interesting information about our first President. However, I was not hooked on this book. I know a book has been great when I am disappointed to finish it. That did not happen with this book.I encountered an error at the beginning of the chapter where Sally is in Bath, England waking up thinking about Washington. It states that it is 7am in Bath and must be noon in the States. This is untrue. There is indeed a 5 hour time difference between England and the Eastern time zone, however England is 5 hours AHEAD of the east coast. 7am in England would be 2am on the east coast. Noon on the east coast is 5pm in England."
5,Just a nice story,"This is the first book that I have ever read by Mary Higgins Clark. I found this book to be delightful, charming, and just a nice story. Very rarely do I finish a book (even one that I really like) and wish that it was longer, but that was exactly how I felt about this one. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Boooring,"I was looking forward to reading this book after my trip to ""Mount Vernon"", Virginia......What a dissapointment!! The story drags on and on without a clear path. With every chapter you switch back and forth in time. The characters are not well developed and the LOVE relationship between the main characters is so weakly portrayed. I really like Mary Higgins Clark's mystery books, this one, though is a thumbs down for sure!!!"
2,"quick read, not a lot of substance","Mount Vernon Love Story is actually Mary Higgins Clark's first book, and after I read the book, I could tell that it was, indeed, her first book. I was rather surprised by the renown author's first writings because they reflect little of her current best selling books. Mount Vernon Love Story is about George Washington, the United States' first President and his growing up in Virginia. He serves in the French and Indian War and later becomes general in the American Revolution. He loves another man's wife, but eventually he finds Martha ""Patsy"" Washington and loves her for her matronly self. There's not much of a love story because he is at war most of the time, and even when they are together, the couple goes through very routine movements. I still do not know a whole lot about the relationship between Washington and his beloved wife, and his own character remains a bit of a mystery. This is a very forgettable book of Mary Higgins Clark."
4,A nice read,"This is the frist book written by Mary Higgins Clark. This book focuses on the love story of George and Martha Washington. The book takes palce in two timelines. It begins with President Washington preparing to leave public office and return to Mount Vernon with his wife Martha, who liked to be called Patsy. And quickly jumps back to periods of Geroge Washinton's youth. Trying to give us some insight on the man and his relation ship with Martha.A lot of research went into this book. And I learned a lot about one of the founding fathers of the USA. The book is a charming and quick read. You almost are left with the thought of yearning for a few more chapters. It made me want to look further into George Washington's life and career."
3,it's ok,"Well I wanted to learn Chinese a bit more. This mini dictionary is good, but the only thing though is that learning the correct pronounciation is a bit challenging. The good thing is the size, it is small so you carry it almost everywhere."
1,Just Imagine NOT buying this book!,"I love Superman, and I have a fondness for Stan Lee, so I bought this title hoping for at the very least a good read. John Buscema is also one of the masters of comicbook art, so I expected a visual treat. All I can say is, expectations were crushed by the terrifying waste of paper and time that is this book.The writing is ham-handed and campy, and the characterizations are broad and silly. The plot is unimaginative, being parts Silver Surfer, parts I don't know what. It seemed like Lee sat down with a list of things he wanted to put in, and just lightly sewed those things together with as little thought as possible.This book is painfully bad, and the artwork does not in the least save it. There is a fun little story in the back that is amusing, but not nearly amusing enough to save the whole package.Save your money - save your sanity - avoid this title. Buy the Just Imagine Wonder Woman title..."
3,Great until it came apart,"The case is slick and sleek, and surprisingly easy to operate the iphone through the plastic face.However, if you have large arms the fit is a bit snug, and mine began to fall apart 2 months into using it. the elastic has now come completely apart.All that said... now that it has fallen apart, I am going to buy another one."
1,Crappy craftmanship,"everytime i slide my iphone out of the sleeve of the armband, I get a sticky glue residue all over the edges of my phone. could've done a better job with quality control."
1,junk,After my first use the glue that holds the plastic screen broke free almost causing my iPhone to fall out. I would go for one with a stitch front screen. the arm band is comfortable and easy to use.
5,A EMOTIONAL TORNADO!,This was the only book that I ever started to read over again as soon as I turned the last page. Stauble had me waking up my neighbors with uncontrolable outburst of laughter. I lost alot of sleep that week.
2,Not worth the read,"It was a poorly written book about a woman who doesn't care who she hurts to satisfy her own needs and wants. I gave the book 2 stars because my hometown was the setting. Otherwise, it deserves 1 star."
1,Absolute rubbish,"This game is rubbish! for starters the characters in this game look stupid at best. The gameplay is hopeless with stupid fights every so often with big ships that use lasers that are impossible to dodge,and take five minutes at the least to destroy. This game looks a lot like an asian game but is about Russians! how dumb is that? I had trouble giving this game 1 star! why would you want to buy this game when you could buy another cheaper but one which is actually fun?"
2,Missing Wands and Half of Cups,"While I like the level of detail in the book, I was disappointed to discover that part of the major arcana was printed twice and the book is missing the entire section on Wands and half the section on Cups."
4,good price. good product.,i'm totally satisfied by this product! i't's a small umbrella of a good quality. you can take it everywhere in your bag or pocket.
5,Leister is God,"The greatest clarinetist ever, his technique is mind-blowing, the man has no break. there are endless pages of sixteenth notes and not one flaw in the playing."
4,Belongs in any filmmaker's library,"Often referred to as the warmup to ""The Quiet Man,"" this film contains some of Ford's best moments. The wordless opening sequence, undergirded by Victor Young's simple, elegant score, is as good as movie making gets, then or now."
3,Rio Grande,"Not as good as the other 2 in John Fords cavelry trilogy but a good enough bit of entertainment. About emotional problems between Captain Yorke(John Wayne)his exwife (maureen O'harra) and there son a young privite, amid the grandure of Monument Valley and the brutality of the Apache war.The story centers around a young man trying to earn his fathers respect, a woman trying to protect her only son from the ravages of military life on the frontier, and the honor bound Capt. Yorke trying to hold it all togather in very tough times. Has music preformed by the sons of the pioners Festus from GunSmoke is the Leed singer. I did think this movie was worth watching and would recomend it to anyone who enjoys classic westerns (Any thing with John Wayne is a classic)"
2,Too Loud,"Purchased for a fun trip with hubby to Vegas. But the panties are way too loud...even in a casino. I don't know who would wear these in public without someone hearing it. Very disappointed. I have had a pair of these 10 years ago and I did not remember what company they were from, but they were great and quiet. Very sad that these have to stay at home and are not returnable."
2,Meh...not so great.,"I opted to get this one instead of the more expensive stroller shades. It doesn't really seem like it blocks the sun all that much since it is a mesh see-through fabric. I held it up to the sun and it still made my eyes water looking through it, so I imagine it's not doing much for my baby. Also, one of the round joints that makes it adjustable broke apart after only about two weeks of use. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,3 and 1/2 Stars,"This is pretty damn good. Yeah, they changed the sound a little bit, but: 1. They probably won't equal Frizzle Fry or Cheese again, and 2. The Brown Album was pathetic after Shake Hands w/ Beef. I think Morello works here because if you multiplied Ler's talent by about 1,000,000, he might sound like Morello. I link Antipop with STP's new Vol. 4-- Both albums don't reach the earlier quality of the bands but are deep with good and pretty good songs. I do hear a slight Pink Floyd influence (the song they did on Debris was ""Have a Cigar,"" not ""Wish you Were Here"")and Antipop starts out as Metallica-meets-Rush. I like Les'sound on this album; ""liquid fuzz"" wouldn't be an inappropriate term."
2,Not as good as previous albums,"I'm a big Primus fan, but to me, Antipop seemed like it had a little too much influence from outside sources, and not enough of just Primus. The Brown Album was good, as was Rhinoplasty. But unlike all other Primus albums, Antipop didn't do much showcasing of a talented bassist, drummer, and guitarist. Plus Les Claypool's voice just doesn't fit the darker image this album had. The album has its moments, but overall if you pass on it, you're not missing too much. Rage and Metallica fans: don't be fooled. Tom Morello and James Hetfield are hard to spot in their respective songs."
5,Les is one funky-*** son of a ***-a!!!!,"This is an amazing album. Instrumentally superb is this album which utilizes some of the music world's greatest guitarists to play along side its best bassist. The Tom Morello produced tracks are stand-outs and most of the album show- cases Primus at its very best. There are a couple of deviations from the norm such as ""Eclectic Electric"" and ""Coattails of a dead man"" and each is very amusing and not altogether out of place on this wonderful album. Lyrically, Les Claypool's story telling lyrics have aged like fine wine and are at their best on tracks such as ""Laquer Head"", ""The Anti-pop"" and ""Natural Joe"" which are all fantastic songs. At the moment this is my favorite Primus album but that always changes, and if you loved this, then you should buy them all."
5,One of the Best CD's in my Collection,"This album is incredible! Every single song is perfect, there are no low points on this CD. The lyrics are great too and combined with Les' powerful bass lines makes a sound that's better then TV. Reminds me of Frizzle Fry but with a heavier, cleaner sound. Get this CD!"
1,DISHONEST TITLE ? - CAVEAT EMPTOR,"Greenwood Press advertises this as ""more than 400 books published"" on Elvis Presley. The true figure is closer to 1100, according to the works of several Elvis bibliophiles (Maria Columbus, Mary Hinds, and Nigel Stevens). If the author only covers 400 books, in NO way is this a ""complete guide to the books about the king."" Save your money for the real thing."
1,Blahblahblahblahblah,"So the media ignored East Timor during the 90s? Well, I don't recall the Nation or MotherJones or NPR saying much about East Timor when Indonesia invaded the place either. The war in Afghanistan?? Well, Amy's buddy, fellow traveller Sasha Cockburn said at the time of the invasion, ""if ever a country deserved to be raped, that country is Afghanistan."" Oh, sorry, that was in 1979, not 2001. try reading the Amsterdam News sometime, and see just what kind of journalism ""the people"" produce. Amy Goodman's another puritanical know-it-all and frankly, as sanctimonious and boring in print as she is on the air."
5,memories beyond graceland gates is an excellent book,"I read this book about two years ago and thought it was an amazing book wrote by an amazing woman. When I started the book it was so captivating I could stop reading until I had finished the book! I highly recommend that everyone read this whether your an Elvis fan or not, it gives insights into his life that will help you better understand Elvis the man not the entertainer."
1,Poor materials and workmanship,"Glad I bought this at a local bike shop so I can go back tomorrow and get a refund.I was willing to give this little half-sized floor pump a chance because it fit my needs perfectly. But the pump head broke in my hand when I first attempted to attach it to a valve stem. Another issue involving sloppy loose thread tolerance where the hose fitting threads into the pump base, I'm quite sure it would have leaked air down there horribly."
3,Frijid Pink CD,MY HUSBAND WANTED A FLASH FROM THE PAST AND I GUESS THIS MET HIS NEEDS. I'M NOT AS JAZZED ABOUT IT MYSELF SINCE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE GROUP. THEY ARE A ONE HIT WONDER.WHATEVER MAKES MY HUSBAND HAPPY IS ALL I WORRY ABOUT. THE GROUP DOES THAT AND SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.
2,Muddy sounding reproduction,The music is good but the sound is kind of muddy and hard to hear. Whoever did the remastering needs to work harder.I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Not Like in the Picture,"I am disappointed in this cord; normally Eve's Addiction is very reliable for good quality, but not this time. The clasp hardly seems secure--it's just a knot that slips through a little loop, and the color isn't the same shade as in the picture. Instead of the dark green I was expecting, I found the cord to be a light lime green. Like I said, surprised and disappointed at the normally-dependable Eve's Addiction."
4,Challenging but worthwhile,"I don't disagree that Creveling's book is a challenging read, but I do think it's a worthwhile and reasonably comprehensive text on the topics. Many of the methods presented require a certain level of sophistication to execute correctly. If you don't understand the material, maybe you shouldn't be trying to use some of the tools."
1,More incompetent than the IRS itself,"After five years of TurboTax with no complaints, I switched to TaxCut for 2002 because it was cheaper and I objected to TurboTax's copy protection. I found TaxCut 2002 to be polished and mostly easy to use, so I was more than happy to pick it up again this year. What a mistake! The difference is night and day. TaxCut 2003 has an unfinished look about it, and I ran in to bugs at nearly every step, both state and federal. I will certainly be going back to TurboTax next year, copy protection or no."
4,watercoloring the easy way,I started right away in learning how to watercolor .It was easy and fun to get started. The paint brushes were in good condition and good quality.The pages were easy to turn and paint on. I recommend this for senior citizens. I learn a good technique for a beginner.
5,Right On!,"It was ""right on"" and works perfect, I,m just sorry I don,t have room for another one because i have a lot of lids,i,m a scaveger i can,t throw things away but just as soon as i can I know I will LOVE IT!"
5,good choice,very good choice. very comfortable shoes look even better in person would recommend this shoes to anyone on the go
5,Phoenix,"This is a fantastic story of a young girl taking on the role of a parent to her siblings as well as to her own mother. It's amazing what a child will do to protect a parent and to make the best of the worst situations. This young girl could handle just about anything put in her path, even things that shouldn't happen in a child's life. I found myself attached to this book trying to see how her life would improve. I recommend this book for everyone to read. It brings a great perspective to all of our lives."
3,The Pearl,"There was a poor family in La Paz, in a small village. Kino and Juana had a son name Coyotito.One day, Coyotito was pinched by a scorpion, but his parents did not have enough money to pay for the medication. They unexpectily found a big pearl from the sea, so they decided to sell it and use the money to save Coyotito. Unfortunately, no one was willing to pay a decent price for the pearl. Since the price offer in the village was not enough to pay for the medication, the couple then decide to go to the capital and hoped to find a better buyer who was willing to offer a better price. Although the parent knew better that there would be many obstacles and problem throughout the journey, their love for their son gave them bravery motivation to move on.The story is very interesting, but the topic is not my favorite. The story is described in detail and it gives me many images as I read on. Therefore, I would give this ***."
5,Excellent mixes,"This is a must have for those of you that collect Madonnas music, not only are the mixes well done but it a comes with a unique never released song titled ""History"". This music single like all of Madonnas music has a good range of different sounds not just your typical remix single in where all the songs usually sound the same."
2,Not a great JUMP in right direction!!!,"I'm big Madonna fan,but last 2 of her maxi-singles s...s!!!There is nothing going on with mixes,you can't actually wait until the end of the song,it is so dreadful!!It is a great song but I wish that she would wisely find somebody who could make a great remix...like BT,Above & Beyond,Tiesto,Armin Van Buuren.....I'm givin' a 2 stars just because I'm a long time fan and i'm collecting all hers cd's!!!"
1,JUNK!!!!,What a piece of junk! B&D should be ashamed. Will not charge even after 30 hrs. Replaced it and same thing! Stay away!!!!
2,Piece of Junk,"I received my light is perfect shape. I charged it as per the owners manual. It was bright for about 10 minutes before going dim. The next time I charged it, it stayed bright for about 5 minutes before going dim. The third time I charged it, it stayed bright for about 1 minute before going dim. I have had the light for only about 4 months now and the battery will not hold a charge now. I called Black and Decker and they told me they could no longer help me as they sold that part of their business. I will never buy another Black and Decker light and I would suggest that you do the same and look somewhere else for a light."
1,USELESS IN AN EMERGENCY,"Bought this flashlight to keep around the house and vehicle for emergencies. It has been turned on maybe three times in the last year and a half since its purchase. When I finally needed it to fix a flat tire on the highway, it wouldn't charge from the vehicle. I took it home hoping a wall outlet would provide the power to charge, but no such luck. Even after 3 days of charging (checking it every few hours) it didn't work. All I got was a very slow turn on and just enough light to find a $1.99 flashlight from 7-11 to do the job. Thanks 7-11! It was great the three times that I did use it, 2 million candlepower is more than enough for any job. It was well taken care of and still looks brand new. So if you need a light for daytime use only and only plan on using it a few times, then this is the flashlight for you."
2,Poor Battery life,This product lasted about 3 years with intermittent use. The problem is that B&D choose the wrong type of battery which has low life span due to memory effect. B&D... there are no-memory-effect batteries available so why are you ripping people off with this product.First time I have been disappointed with a B&D product.
1,Bad Light,when it workied the battery life was poor... I dropped it from about 3 feet while working onto grass and it stopped working altogeather.... piece of junk.
2,Very Tasty - BUT BEWARE,"Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of ""Yeast Extract"".It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive."
5,FANFREAKINTASTIC,These chips are FANFREAKINTASTIC. They are with out a doubt the best chips that I have ever had. A nice sweet smoky flavor and then a little bit-o-heat. OH YA BABY.
4,tasty,"These chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa. The texture is brittle and thin, like other Plocky's chips.The only downside: the spice is minimal."
5,Gospel's Destiny's Child,"To find good, young and hip-hop music in the gospel area has recently gotten easier with the help of such artists as Kirk Franklin and Trinitee. This CD is one of the best gospel CDs I own. You have your uptempo fast songs that could easily pass as any other contemporary R&B songs out such as IMAGINE THAT and HOW YOU LIVING. Then there are the ballads such as the peaceful and beautiful title cut SPIRTIUAL LOVE and the showstopping I PROMISE YOU with one of the best singers Crystal Lewis. There is the old school gospel with songs such as HIGHWAY and THERE IT IS. All in all, this is a CD that can really bring people to GOD and should be in alot more people's collections."
4,Good Solid Disc Uplifting,Trin-I-Tee 5:7 sounds Really Good on this Follow-up to their first Album.I Really Like How They express themselves.There He is is a Good Song.These Ladies are Very Blessed.this is Uplifting Music.
4,umm,"good service, only thing was i wasnt expecting the case to be cracked, but that might of happen in delivery, but its cool."
4,Molly's Yes has what it takes to be big.,"Strong songs. Good melodies. Lyrics with depth. The music flows and jumps. They are even good at live performances. My favorite songs are Sugar, And She, and Hypnotic. Very easy to imagine Scars being played on the radio."
3,Not the best toy available,"My son who just turned 6 put TJ away for a while but has lately enjoyed reading the books with the bear after school. I bought a few more titles lately, including My Big Mess. This toy is exactly like the others - 3 lights requiring 3 AAA batteries. There is a movable roller at the end, but it is mechanical and does not move during the story. The vaccum does not make sounds, but there are sounds added from the cassette when the vacuum is supposed to be operational. I find this lame for a vaccum. I think the lights make more sense for the other toys and would skip this unless it is for a much younger child."
5,This book plus Puppy Preschool are great for new puppy owners,"Although current trainers believe John Ross's methods are outdated now, my husband and I used them to train a very feisty determined Dane Lab mix who turned out to be a most wonderful, smart companion. His method is also positive reinforcement"
5,Outstanding!,Great product and great service! Every dog owner would benefit from ownig this book. It helps in every aspect of raising my ZuChon propely! Thanks!
3,"Boy howdy, dogs don't listen...","This book is full of great ideas and concepts. I purchased the title based on average customer review, and really grasped the concepts within. However, once I finally got my dog, I quickly learned that many of the things the book takes for granted lead to much frustration on your part. Dogs don't just sit in front of you, though that's one of the big points the book relies on. Dogs won't just stand next to you, no matter how hard you make them try. Pick up the book if you want a nice read, and want to have some great concepts, but take the time to follow-up the book with some hardcore, professional obedience training. Doing it yourself will result in hours of frustration, and an unruly pet."
1,"Nicole Eggert fans, pass on this","The other reviews are right that this movie isn't campy, it's just boring and numbing. I watched it because I'm a fan of Nicole Eggert. Yes, she makes B movies, but I find her sexy and fun. Not anymore. She was neither in this, just old. -- Keith Vlasak"
5,A solution for life!,"I bought my first copy of this book at the age of eighteen. At that time, I didn't believe there were any solutions other than rigid ""diet plans"" so I tossed the book into my drawer. Ten years later after failing every diet and diet center plan on earth, or at least it seemed like every plan on earth, I took this book out and really studied and learned. I committed to the keys to weight mastery and miracles began to happen in my life. You have to read and apply the principles to really experience what this life-plan can do. I also want to strongly recommend another book written by Judy Wardell's husband. The book is entitled Silent Hunger, written by Arthur Halliday. The two books together are a terrific source of life-changing strategies to deal with weight problems. I recommend them to anyone and everyone."
3,Much Better Pitney Collections Out There!,"If you want a quick earful of Gene Pitney, the songs here are good. That said, there are much better compilations of Gene Pitney's work on CD. This may be a good budget-buy CD, but you miss out on such great tunes like ""Something's Got a Hold Of My Heart"" or ""That Girl Belongs To Yesterday.""The ultimate Gene Pitney collection, in my opinion, is the 2 CD compilation ""Looking Through."" Not only do you get the abovementioned songs, but you get scores of Pitney's lesser known tunes like ""Billy You're My Friend."" Even cooler, it contains Pitney singing several of his hits in Italian, and also includes his duet with Marc Almond.This CD is OK for the price, but the extra cost in buying a more thorough Gene Pitney collection is well worth it."
2,A teaser,"Apparently Mr. Pankau thinks his readers aren't savvy enough to realize his books contain just enough information to ""make you dangerous"", but not enough to follow through thoroughly. I have no doubt that Mr. Pankau makes the majority of his wages by writing books and lecturing."
3,Could use a little fine tuning,"This motherboard works great, but for something labeled as Vista edition, it could use some fine tuning. For one thing, all the fancy utilities that you can install require administrative priveleges to run, which negates the purpose of Vista's UAC.Also, I don't see how the fancy heat pipe system improves anything. My mobo still runs fairly hot. I'm not even overclocking the thing.Still, ASUS makes some of the best mobo's in the biz, and I'm a loyal customer. Once you get past these little inconveniences, it is a sturdy board with awesome on board sound and lots of features (for those willing to run all of there accounts as admins)."
5,Great product,"This is a great add on for your PSP. I have somewhat large hands, and this helps my PSP fit me a lot better. I am finding that I'm enjoying older games again because they play easier now that I'm not struggling to hang on to my PSP. I recommend this to anyone who has a PSP. Plus the company that is selling them ships VERY fast! I couldn't be happier."
1,Worthless trinket!!,"The alarm is a virtually useless trinket. Reflection from the sun inside the backup light consistently sets off the alarm most of the day except from about 10am to 2pm. Purchase is a complete waste of money. The alarm is a worthless dollar shop trinket! ""Buyer beware!!"""""
5,Just as good as the first!,"These two ladies have the best voices in musical theatre. Their first album blew me away and I was expecting this one to be a disappointment. This album is just as good as the first. I especially liked the fact that they both sang solos, and that is the highlight of this album. Emily is hilarious on The Alto's Lament, and Alice shines on Losing Track of Time. What an amazing voice. I loved Emily's version of I Don't Know How To Love Him, it is one of my favorite songs from a musical and she performs it beautifully. I have to say though that Unsuspecting Hearts is absolutely gorgeous and of all the songs they have recoreded on this and the fisrt one, this is the best. This album is worth buying just for that one song. I will say it again. These ladies have amazing voices!"
5,Love this CD,Bronson picked all the best songs and performed them better than the original artist! These songs are on my ipods most played list. Bronson rocks!
4,Bronson Arroyo,"I heard Bronson sing last year when they played some of his footage from Hot Stove on NESN and I couldn't believe how great his voice was. I am a die hard Sox fan, and a fan of his so I was happy when he released a cd. Yes, it is all covers but he sings them very well. My personal favorites are Freshman and Shimmer, but really the whole album is awesome. I was at his concert last Wednesday and he was amazing live as well. He is a talented guy, I can't wait to see what he comes up with for his next cd!Lorin, Boston MA"
4,Great favorites with a new voice,"To the technically trained this selection may or may not measure up but to the casual listener, it is enjoyable and fun. The selections are both familiar and varied. The fact that a major league pitcher is the vocalist adds interest to the old tunes. It is fun to listen to for adults and kids given the special interest of the musicians."
1,Confusing and Hard,"This cheap immitation of Zumba is confusing and boring.The music is terrible, unlike the Zumba videos that inlcude popular music HITS.The brazilian instructor is annoying and after watching the video 5 times i did not learn any new steps.Don't waste your money with this product."
2,Worst math book ever,"Having a teacher that loved this book didn't help. It was confusing, very hard to read, the problems were boring, and I found lots of typos and grammatical errors. It was just a very frustrating book to work with for a whole semester. The new edition isn't any better."
5,Awesome,I love this book who thinks this book SUCKS you suck BALLSBuy this bookPlease buy this book kids
4,Really cool,It was good but to short and not enough righting so that's y I but 4 stars. But it's still a good book.
2,This book was very terrible,"First of all, this book was very crude. I have been a fan of Captain Underpants since the year 2000. They take out Captain Underpants and put in this new kid called Super Diaper Baby. I was very disappointed when I read the book. They kept talking about bad stuff. I'm very disappointed that they took out Captain Underpants."
3,Kid book,its good bc im a kid but adults might think they either want to throw up when they read it or probubly throw up its a kid book hands down.
5,The best baby book ever,It was awesome that the baby was so strong and smartCoolAwesomely cool. Amazingly awesomeWe love it lots
2,. It was just an OK movie,It needed better actors and the story line was predictable it didn't wow me while watching but I am a Sci-fi junky and over all liked it.LDM
3,Not the best Bible map source,"I have studied Bible maps from various sources for a long time, and use them frequently when I study Biblical history. I have several other books, and use online sources and Bibles with maps included. I find this book to be rather inaccurate in placing the cities when compared to the preponderance of other available sources. It also seems to only show the more well known and famous cities mentioned, rather than identifying as many places as have been identified that are mentioned in scripture. I've seen much more complete maps. This book may be handy for showing slides and ""good enough"" for the casual user or beginner in Bible studies, but I expected much more from a book devoted to Biblical maps. If you're going to compile a work on such a specific and narrow subject matter, you would think more effort would have been put into it."
3,Then and Now Bible Maps,"The item came in a timely manner, it had a water stain on the bottom edge but was otherwise in great condition."
3,"Very tight, so hard to cut with it","While the spring mechanism makes it easy to OPEN this pair of scissors (it practially remains open unless if you force it to close otherwise), my almost 3 year old daughter isn't strong enough to close this pair of scissors. So she ended up using both hands to make it happen. So far it's not working out well for us. Maybe when she's a little stronger it'll work..."
1,As bad as it gets! CALL DROPPER!!,"This phone would fool anyone, with it's great look and sleek design, but have it for just one week and you'll see the true side of it. Along with the buttons getting pressed mistakenly in my pocket, and POOR battery life, the phone drops calls.. ALOT!The phone drops calls worst that any phone I've ever had. Then I came to realize that Motorola knew about this problem so they decided to recall it. I called my phone carrier and they said thay couldn't do anything about it.. and they said I should give motorola a call. OK so I did, and yes you guessed it. They said that they might be able to fix the problem, but I'd have to send it to them for about two to three weeks without a loaner. What great customer service eh?I've since switched to the V360 and it's 110% better."
2,Motorola fails to impress,"This phone was my first jump into the flip phone category. I had been using the standard Nokia phones and was looking forward to something new. The phone is a good basic phone with all the standard features, but it comes with plenty of problems in the long run. My speaker stopped working and the phone doesn't always charge well. Ironically, this happened right after my 1 year warranty expired. I'm considering switching to a Nokia 6102 which is the first flip phone for Nokia. It has received great reviews since appearing on the market."
1,BE AWARE!!! The service plan is untrustworthy,"The phone is great, but order the service through Amazon is terrible. I had a similar experience in which Amazon contacted me via email and explained that more info was needed to process the application...., just like the other two reviewers, although the email from Amazon indicated that they had automatically canceled the order due to insufficient information. They DID NOT refund my money to my credit card. I have contacted Amazon but gotten no response yet....Be aware to order the service through Amazon, you might end up giving ALL your information through internet for a credit check but get hassle in return."
5,Another classic Christmas CD...,"You'll want to put this one on every Christmas hereafter. I just attended Amy's Christmas concert in which she sang many of these songs and it was wonderful! She's such a special person and so down to earth. The music on this CD is classic, and you'll enjoy every song!"
3,Third X-mas Album?!,"Here I was buying my X-mas music for this year when I see that Amy Grant had a X-mas album, I don't know if it's just me, but this is Amy's third X-mas album?! What can you expect? Well, I was quite disappointed when I bought & heard the album, four out of the 11 songs were some language I have no clue what it was. Very melancholic and the CD will put you to sleep unfortunately. I was expecting so more classics like her previous X-mas albums', but what can you expect? Maybe she ran out ideas. I don't reccommend this album unless you buy Amy Grant CD's because you feel like you 'have to'."
1,Beware Before You Buy,"This Review is not for the content thats in the comic, however this review is for the next buyer who is a serious X-men fan. That this book is not worth the price tag that sellers are selling this mere comic book not an Omni Bus Addition or special release of a hard to get copy, if there was more info on this comic in terms of pages which is a standard comic for the price of 3.00 with a few more pages added i would have not spent my hard earned 16.00$ that said i am an X-Men Collector even buying the X-Men Video Games, This book is not worth the price the sellers are trying to get you to spend.. Remember people they cannot charge an astronomic price if they cannot sell it!!! so don't buy and the price will fall!!! For the record used is also a bit pricey..."
2,Live Tracks--Be Warned,"You won't get original recordings here, so proceed at youir own risk, or if you just want to hear the Comets live."
4,Intensive detail for the advanced auto historian,This is a really great book if you've read all the standard simple stuff that passes for automotive history today. You have to reach back to now-dead authors to find this kind of intensive first-hand knowledge.
4,good stuff,"The studio take of Hurricane is to me the best, I tend to prefer it over any of the ""live"" performances. Poncho could not get the right rhythm on guitar, so instead puts those nice strings sounds on keys,while Neil plays this beautiful, beautiful soaring piece of work on guitar. Will to Love was literally recorded in front of a crackling fire,with a few overdubs.The album includes some country-flavored gems and rockers that truly define Neil in the nineteen seventies!"
4,INXS Videos,"Fabulous collection of INXS videos spanning their career. I do have some quibbles that a few of the videos are not the defining ones for a particular song (like ""Mystify""), but in most of those cases the video selected is at least interesting. Also, the transitional insights by the band members between each song are entertaining, often hilarious, as much older and wiser men look back on the hijinks of their party days with thinly disguised horror and amusement. For fans of the band and those unfamiliar with their work, this collection shows why their concerts were ""must"" events from the late '80's through the mid '90's. Highly recommended."
5,GREAT SHOW,I WONDER IF MICHAEL HUTCHINS DIDNT DIE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO LISTEN MORE GREAT ROCK SONGS FROM INXS?.HE IS LIVIN IN MY CDS N DVDS.I THINK ITS A GREAT LEGACY OF A MAN COULD LEAVE BEHIND.
4,Lots of lovely photos,This book is pretty well written with lots of lovely photos of vintage pieces. Not exactly what I thought it would be but it was super cute!
3,"Nice to look at, but not much info","Flea Market Baby is a cute lightweight book - well designed but without much content. Readers looking for solid, workable nursery and gift ideas (whether for crafting or purchase) will be sorely disappointed, although others seeking pretty pictures and examples of excellent photo design may well be delighted. It seems as though the authors started out with a good idea, but somehow lost their way in execution - what makes for a fun hobby is not necessarily that which translates well into a book. Ideas for using flea market finds start strong, but rapidly lose steam. Giving a retro baby shower? Buy old invites and use old decor. That's pretty much representative of the depth of the content."
5,One in a million,"All the other reviewers have already expressed verbally how good this CD really is. I haven't been privy to enjoy any of their other CD's, but this CD is so perfect, that im almost afraid of listening to their other CD's. I can imagine that it would be very difficult even for them to out do what they have done on this CD.Believe me, this CD is worth it."
5,Christmas gift,Christmas gift for grand daughter. She had seen before and really enjoyed on TV so we bought it for her.
3,Super Small,I expected it to be bigger than it actually was. Guess I should have read the reviews better. Oh Well.
2,A Let Down,"The plot seemed good, but if you wanted steamy sex scenes.........forget it. The movie dragged on and the end was anti climax........ excuse the pun!"
5,Amazing Book...Addressing Other Reviewers' Low Ratings,"I think it's very unfair for people to give this book only 1 or 2 stars simply because it was not useful to you as an English teacher. Perhaps it didn't suit your purposes, but that does not make it a bad book. Those who cannot write, teach. Isn't that the way the saying goes? I guarantee that any writer will find this book useful. And if you have any writer who cannot write about adultery or other 'touchy' subjects, then your book will not be interesting anyway! I would like to also add that I loved this book. It is not boring, the prompts aren't pulled from a boring website, these are amazing prompts! Also, the introduction was great, as well as the suggestions at the back for being able to get more use out of this book. They understand what it is like to want to get the most for your budget. I found this book to be helpful, creative, imaginative and just down right fun!"
3,"Uhm,,, Well...",This was not a *bad* book. I just didn't feel like it was a *great* book. But I do think that it would be a wonderful aide to english teachers who are needing some fresh ideas for a creative writing class.
4,sturdy well made straws,"The Glad Flex Straws are well made, and very sturdy. They are however slightly bigger around than the straws I've bought in the grocery, and do not fit in the single serving Pedialyte drinks I've bought.So while I recommend the product because of it's good quality, if you want to use it in a product as I mention above with a small aperture be aware it may not fit. That's the only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of the 5 star it deserves for quality."
1,Read the Editorial Review Before Buying!,"The shows are great, but make sure understand that you are only buying a total of ten shows on five DVD's. Compared to other TV DVDs, the price seems very high and out of proportion for what you receive. Had I realized it was only ten episodes I would not have purchased!"
4,"Not as good as ""Jam""","I give this four stars because the guitar in some of the songs is mixed back just a hair bit more than it should have been, but it is still well worth the price. If you can find another album in a similar fashion as this one titled ""Jam"", buy it also."
1,Not Durable,"Looking for a durable dog toy, this is not it. It took 30 seconds for my pup to have stuffing everywhere and there is nothing positive I can say about the latex... very thin. Directly thrown into the trash."
4,"Lovely story, but what is the ending?","I think that Mr. Merullo is a lovely writer who is able to turn a phrase and use language in a way that evokes a very strong and exact feeling.I thought this was a beautiful story, although at times the pacing didn't seem quite right. It took place in less than 3 months, I think, but it felt like the 2 main characters had been involved for a much longer time.The ending was a non-ending which left me totally unsatisfied. There needed to be several more pages to give some closure to how the operation(s) turned out. It just stopped at a very odd point.But overall, I liked the book and the characters and will certainly read more from this author."
5,Thought-provoking and moving,"Having enjoyed Merullo's writing in the past, perhaps I'm a bit biased. Yet this is a different subject matter than we've read before. What hasn't been pointed out in other reviews is that, like his past writing of life in Revere, Mr. Merullo again presents us with a theme he is familiar with. I don't feel obligated to forgive any possible sentimentality we see here - and didn't find it got in the way of simply a well-told ""story"". The author has a daughter with CF, so I'm sure that fact may have inspired some of the content of this book. All I know is that this author's work had consistently brought reall enjoyment to this reader - principly because of his way of observing the world we live in, and the other people among us."
1,The African origin of Greek Philosophy,"A rather tiresome read which though initially promising fails to prove anything new. It just confirmed what I have beleived all along, that so many nations and individuals while tying to detruct from Hellenic achiements and indeed highjack concepts, expose their own ignorance. While truly great, the Egyptian civilisation was too preoccupied with death to expand on Philosophy,unlike the Greeks who celebrated life and expanded philosophical concepts as a means to explain it."
1,Do NOT Purchase - Read Comments First (DVD production problem),"I've had it for a while, just watched it. I can't believe that the last chapter(18) does not play. This is production issue!. I think I'm going to hold off buying any more pre-order telenovelas until I see someone write a review, because this is a waste of time and money. Of course it was great until the end--missing the end!!!!"
1,Belinda,"BelindaI bought this Drama & we are disappointed, because it doesn't have ending. Don't buy it, this is another south of the border ripoff.Para su informacion no compre este producto sin antes leer los comentarios aqui escrito, este drama no tiene final tal parece que esta gente no revisan sus productos antes de mandarlos al mercado."
3,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LAZQDA/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title,I saw this on tlc and missed a few of the shows now that I reviewed the show i like what i see.
5,Excellent manual for the price,Easier to read than factory shop manual and a lot less money too.Factory manuals require 2 o 3 manuals to get the same information.Good book to keep on board the boat.
5,very good movie,"The reason i like this movie so good, is that it was filmed mostly in Gaffney SC, at Limestone College. My hometown. The movie itself, dosnt tell you why this guy is killing the people.So its dosnt have a good plot."
2,Final Exam,"I was disappointed with Final Exam. However, any 80's slasher is still worth watching. This one moves at a snail's pace and is similar in blandness to Splatter University. As for the actual product my only complaint is the audio, which is at a very low level and not great in clarity. The picture quality is nice, and it features a commentary track. Check out Rush Week and The House on Sorority Row if you want to see a college slasher film done right."
1,the worst of the slashers,this movie is a mess. it starts off like a collage comedy then some prankerts fake a mass shooting (this part is very hard to take after all the bad things like that witch have happened ). the the slasher takes stage. the last 45 mins. is his rampage. we never know anything about him or why he kills . if your a gore hound there isn't even any blood to get you by. a very poor movie
3,"good content, poor form","This author is writing about a fascinating period of time and clearly has great knowledge and insite. But he is too clever for his own good. All of his fancy prose and silly metaphors just get in the way, If you have a good story to tell, tell it. Stop trying to draw attention to yourself."
4,Generations of Winter,Generations of Winter: Excellent portrayal of the period from post- Russian revolution through the end of World War II told through the travails of a family.
5,Working for God,There is nothing better then a true life experience of someone going to great lengths to spread the gospel. I purchased this book going off of other reader reviews. I will agree once I started reading I couldn't put the book down! This is not Hollywood sugar coated material but real life as it happens (and still is!) I highly recommend this book!
4,close to indispensible,"Won't appeal to the DVD generation of magicians.It is densely written in the style of times gone by.If you can get past this (i.e can read, and can interpret instructions that are written, instead of being spoonfed)you will have all the moves you could ever need."
3,You should see the play first to understand the opera,"There are two drawbacks with this production: no subtitles (although in English, I found the sung words almost impossible to understand); and unless you have a comprehensive understanding of the story, such as by seeing the play, you will have little meaningful comprehension of the plot. The performers were praised for their work, so the jacket says, so I suppose it is otherwise well done. Britten is not one of my favorite composers."
4,Fun with Elmo,"My son loves books, this one is fun because he can look at whats under the flaps and learn to count,find things that match and find opposites. He plays awhile looking at this, he received this when he was 2 years old and now he is 4 years old."
2,Garmin Data Card for Mexico of Questionable Value,"I acquired this product for use in a trip from Oklahoma City to San Miguel D'Allende Mexico. After we got to Mexico it worked fine on the interstate highways and in some of the larger towns and cities but was, of course, of little value in some of the smaller cities and towns. It was useless in a great deal of the time since there only a are few large cities. I finally quit using it altogether."
5,Not for Vibe GT!!!!!!,"This is the correct fit for the vibe 5 speed, but not the vibe GT 6 speed. The GT uses 2 of the exact same O2 sensor and they should include the rubber grommet because both are replaced from the passenger side under neath the car directly in front and behind of the catalytic converter which is not the same as the regular vibe. Do not buy this one if you have a GT. I had to buy an additional Bosch 15290 Oxygen Sensor which is a little more expensive after I installed the first one."
5,beautiful!!!!,This is a very well illustrated book and information on items in book is very helpful. Got many answers I was looking for.
5,Wonder resource with LOTS of photos,"Wonderful, easy to read info with photos that show a lot of detail. I've already use it to identify a ""mystery"" plate."
1,Simply not a good book.,"I have been unfortunate enough to pick this book up as a starting point for Mac programming. Very heavy on sample code that's either not explained at all for a few chapters or just glossed over after you're made to type, compile and run it. Explanations are in the line-by-line format with no explanation of the larger context of what you're actually doing.The book jumps around between new and legacy frameworks and environments as if a beginner needs to be confronted with more choices.Oh and 200 of the 620 odd pages of content is about scripting, which again is split into UNIX scripting, Python/Ruby and AppleScripting...I almost gave up on getting to grips with Mac programming until i thankfully threw this book in the bin and started again with something that's better structured."
4,"pretty good replacement for ""I Spy"" books","There are 19 paintings from the collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that list things to look for in the painting. This is a neat way to incorporate art with your child while playing. My kids love the ""I Spy"" books and this is no different. There is a wide range of artwork from ancient Egyptian up to modern day. I only wish the book were longer with more paintings included."
1,Can you find it? book,"This book geared to much older children than 3 and 4 year olds, so I returned the 2 I had ordered for my grandsons. I even had trouble finding the items to be matched."
3,"4 stars for quality and taste, 3 stars for the price","I like Stevita products and these are no exception. You don't have to worry about the ingredients, because everything is natural and there are no surprises here. The taste is good, albeit a little weak compared to similar ""Aspartame"" flavored products. However, when you do the math, you are paying approximately 70 cents per packet and this doesn't even include the price of the water. If you still want an all-natural drink mix that is less expensive, take a look at the True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade. The product link is below.True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade Drink Mix, 10-count (Pack of 6)"
2,Careful if buying this,"The description does not make it clear that this ONLY works for 'heating' applicances between 500 and 1600 watts. You CANNOT use this for computers, lower-wattage devices, etc.I just received it and I'm going to return it, as I can't use this for phones, etc. with which I travel."
4,Nice change of pace for the season,My children and I enjoy this Christmas CD. Often it is preferred over the 'usual' Christmas music that we get bombarded by from Thanksgiving through Christmas. A nice change!
2,Book Quality,The book was listed as good but had significant water (coffee?) damage. Not hard to read but definitely not good quality and not something I would give as a gift.
5,Book of Qualities,This book has something for everyone. It covers emotions that I didnt even know I had. It made me laugh and sometimes cry. This book touches your soul.
4,Just Wonderful,This is such a pretty book. I can truly appreciate her writing. I hope we see more from her in the future.
5,A Sweet CD,"My three children and I really enjoy this sweet CD. It is filled with classic lullabyes and bed time tunes and the wonderful Veggie religious message. We don't use this specifically as a bedtime CD [though it would probably be fine], but we enjoy listening to it & singing along throughout the day."
4,One of my favorite -ziq albums,"The first track on this album ""Roy Castle"" just blew me away. I've probably listened to it more than any other -ziq song ever, it just has that ambient, computer, video game type beauty to it. The rest of the album is also good, with some annoying tracks like ""Mr. Angry"". My only disapoitment is that none of the other tracks come close to the beauty of the first one. Oh well, still a wonderful IDM album."
4,I actually really like this album,"I am surprised to find myself enjoying Mu-ziq's music, but it really is great. As cheesy as it sounds his best work just sounds happy, and it puts a smile on my face. The album is good for just putting in and zoning out while on a drive, though it does get noticeably weak after ""Phiesope"" (track 7) click on that track now for a listen, it is the highlight of In Pine Effect and really a great song, I cannot believe it has not been co-opted for a commercial yet. (Or has it???)After ""Phiesope"" it does get weaker, it just becomes more harsh and abrasive which I don't think is Mu-ziq's strong point. Still I can recommend this album, it is good fun. Check out his Brace Yourself EP too, good clean fun for the whole family."
3,Not in full effect,"This u-ziq album is slower and more melodic than most, lacking the frentic D&B that's in many of his others. It does get catchy after a while but it took me several listens. The first half of the disc is very warm and upbeat, almost popish. It cimaxes with Phiesope (which everyone else who reviewed it seemed to love), then gets disjionted and keeps me on my toes a bit more. There isn't really a stand out track on this for me. I usaully put it on track 7, skip 8, then listen to it through. I rate it smack dab in the middle of the U-Ziq collection, The best of his slow stuff but not better than any of his fast. (Which is better than most so it gets 3 stars instead of 2 1/2). It did disappiont me when I bought it, expecting (or hoping) for it to resemble more closely Squarepusher than Boards of Canada. Oh well, I'm still glad I own it, you'll be moderatly impressed with it too."
4,ok,"It helps you see how you react to people and situations around you, and shows you how to change your way of thinking in situations."
5,Barbie and the Nutcracker Golden Book,This is a great introduction to the Nutcracker. Beautiful pictures and brief text. It's a quick bedtime read or a short story to accompany recommended Tchaikowsky classical CD of Ballet fame.
4,Textured pop at its finest,"Moose's third lp continues their string of lovingly crafted music which receives critical raves in knowledgable places and is totally ignored elsewhere. This time they include bits of parping brass and a greater concentration on loss and regret, but the recipe is still tuneful, well-crafted, beautiful pop, more consistent than Aztec Camera, more genuine than The Boo Radleys. This is a band that, as one critic has said, is ""likely to remain a glorious cult."" Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins and Alexandra of Spring add with their backing vocals on standout tracks ""Play God"" and ""Regulo 7"" and perhaps the loveliest Moose track yet is the curious ""The Man Who Hanged Himself."" This band has yet to record a bad song or even a toss-off. Check them out."
2,Okay if you have a PC,I could not get it to work with my Intel Mac so I eventually returned it. Tech support was very helpful but only as helpful as they could be with out fixing the problem. The quality was so so but for the price not so bad. I would avoid it if you can find an alternative or if you have a Mac but if you have a PC and can't find an alternative then it will probably work fine.
1,What a waste!,"I brought this book along with me on a recent Island vacation...plenty of time to read a good book or two. After reading the other reviews, I thought this would be a fun read on the beach. WRONG! Maybe I missed the point of the book (is there really one?). The chapters are 3-4 page snippets from a snippy, unappealing narrator. Throughout the book, every once and ahwile there appeared an interesting character or two, but then they would disappear--never resolved or heard from again. Don't waste your time!"
5,One of the best translator,"This book is perfectly translated to Spanish by one of the bests, Aida Marcuse. She has beautifully translated some Dr. Seuss books and she captivates my pre-schooler (and myself) with perfect rhymes every time. If a person doesn't find the rhymes in this book (which is hard not to) is because he/she doesn't know Spanish very well. Books originally written in English, specially the ones with rhymes, are very hard to translate. I only buy them if they are translated by Marcuse or Yanitzia Canetti."
4,Pretty Damn Awesome,"I REALLY liked this book. If you've ever had to analyze a historical text, this book will resonate with you. It's a real page turner and gives some historical contexts to guatemala too. there are a few times when there are coincidences/improbabilities, but I was so wrapped up in the historical puzzle, they didn't matter to me. You should definitely read it if you've ever studied Latin American history."
1,Very cheap plastic game,"The game didn't work when we received it and calling customer support did get us a new one. It's all plastic, really easy to break. There's a switch that counts clicks when you turn the board. Some chip in there keeps track and our 'chip' was bad according to customer support. If your kids will use it for one or two times, then you should be fine. We got a replacement and it worked for a day."
3,I should've read the reviews from earlier before ordering,"Had I known the stupid buttons were without lights and when you had most of the cases picked you had to have a photographic memory, I wouldn't have bought it. I guess the inventor thought you should know what 20 some cases you've already picked. Seriously though; the TV show would have bombed with a series of guesses and misses in picking remaining cases....as this game makes you do."
3,It can get old,It is really exciting the first time you play it. After that it gets old. It is a little slow and can get repetitive. You may want to be gentle the turning of the board becomes a tad rough.
3,Disappointed,"As I am in a choir that will be singing the Brahms Requiem in English, I was looking forward to hearing this recording. This CD recording of a choral work is perhaps one of the worse I have ever heard as far as diction. You cannot make out the words to the point I sometimes wonder if the choir switched back to singing the German text. This ""mushiness"" appears to be the result of very poor mixing by the Telac engineers as I am sure the Mormon Tablernacle Choir is capable of much better diction."
5,Excellent film,"This film was very entertaining, but if you're easily confused or lacking a sense of humor I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Garbage!!!,"I can't believe I even watched this! I watch LOTS of movies, and enjoy a good twistful plot, or even some artful direction, but this garbage was the absolute worst film I believe I've ever seen. Yes, Anthony Hopkins is in it. He however, wrote and directed it. Sometimes, it's probably best that people stick with what they are good at. He can act, yes. Write and direct, no. Don't waste your money or your time."
2,Disappointed,"After hearing so many great things about 'The L Word' I went ahead and bought the entire series. While I admit it makes an effort to be relevant and inclusive, I could not get over the shallow treatment of transgendered individuals and bisexuals on the show. I also failed to see the relevance of the death of someone very likeable in the third season. The moment that happened, I lost all faith in the show itself and in Ilene Chaiken. I thought this series was shallow and failed to go underneath the surface. I also found the writing to be tedious and self-indulgent. This could have been so much better. The only relationship I actually liked was the one between Lara and Dana, although Tina and Bette were not bad either. A disappointment all around, but that is just my opinion."
5,AWESOME!!!!,"Great buy, great service! Originally expected it to srrive later than I needed it (it was a gift), but the seller came through and got it to me well before time. I love this series!!!"
5,L word The Series,"I chose 5 stars because this series helps lesbians relate to real life problems,and find solutions. I feel like the characters depict real relationshipsIn society. I particularly enjoy watching each character ""come out""or help others to do so. It helps people who are gay to know that is okay.I just wish we had a place like The Planet, where we could meet otherlesbians and share our trials and tribulations together.I learned that finding your true self can be done best through exploration.I relate to each character in some way, which I'm sure we all do.I've learned that being in a monogamous lesbian relationship, relationship canbe very difficult at times but so can being in a straight one. If you followyour heart, be true to yourself, everything else will fall into place.I'm very sad that The L Word is no longer on, and there will never bea replacement. Thanks for reading."
2,They Absolutely Blew it !!!,"The first 15 to 20 minutes of this film are excellent. There's almost no dialogue and lots of suspense as Luther (Clint Eastwood) a jewel thief, robs a Washington officials apartment. He's almost caught and then witnesses a sleazy sex liaison and murder performed by the President of the United States (Gene Hackman -who mercilessly chews the scenery in this one). Unfortunately what follows becomes more and more unbelievable and the film disintegrates as unrealistic characters appear in the film and it becomes another dumb wanna-be-Hollywood blockbuster kind of film. Surprisingly it was written by William Goodman who has detailed he wasn't happy with the way the film turned but respects the way director and star Clint Eastwood works very much. (1997 - Directed by Clint Eastwood)"
1,Began pretty good then got worse and then even worse.,"Started off like a pretty good thriller but went into the toilet in the first 15 minutes beginning with the ""love/sex scenes which were ludicrous.The plot is completely innane and when you stop and think about it quite laughable.Other than for the dough, I can't imagine how good actors got involved with this dreckI certainly can't imagine why good actresses like Laura Linney and Judy Davis even accepted these awful roles.So one dimensional! Laura is goodness itself (she can be briefly upset but soon becomes goodness itself again!)Judy is badness itself.This movie is a joke and old Clint gets to be Mr Most Brilliant, Most Clever, Most Dadly Dad, Most Daring, Most Courageous - sweet role for him, for sure."
2,"READ THE BOOK, FORGET THE FILM.","I read the brilliant book first (always a good idea) and got the film expecting a similar reaction. If you want a standard Clint Eastwood thriller with a top notch crew then this is your standard fare. It's all fairly nice and staid and rather slushy at the end but if you want a version of the book DON'T BOTHER it is a virtual rewrite, leaving out the main character Jack, his daughter's ex-boyfriend completely. The basis of the book was built around him defending Luther and finding out the truth. In the book the daughter hates Luther, in this she just vaguely dislikes him. Don't want to give to much away but Luther isn't even in the end of the book and the way he manipulates the authorities is non-exsistant. See what i mean? they should of said 'based on the book...but only a little'."
3,"TENSION DRIVEN BY CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, NOT CIRCUMSTANCE","Despite the plot's dainty pablum (morality plus blackmail in high quarters) and somewhat farfetched setup (even if Clinton and a certain intern may have made it very credible for recent generations), the strength of Absolute Power lies in its character interactions. It is simply captivating to watch stalwarts exchange fairly taut dialogue.The denouement comes a bit hot-footed and wraps up loose ends a bit too neatly, making you think ""Why didn't they just do that earlier?"" and leaving you with an after-taste that the film lacked consistence or even any real depth. E.g., couldn't we have done without the subplot involving the daughter? Why not use Ed Harris a bit more? etc.Nonetheless, while watching it is riveting in its buildup of suspense, and to its credit the pace doesn't dilly-dally. Certainly a very worthy rental."
2,Died after less than a year.,"Worked great for less than a year. Plastic lugs used to secure pump housing broke at seam, now pump is out of action. Hoping to get Beckett to act on it since it was sold with a one year warranty (have less than three weeks to get it resolved. Great Disappointment pump was quiet didn't draw much current and flowed water really well in my pond. I notice that there is an almost similar pump being offered from beckett that only has a 60 day warranty (do not buy) If you can get a good price (around $100) this pump is a good buy even if it fails in a year. I have had more pumps that were more than twice the price fail in two years so I guess I am ahead of the game."
2,Product & support fall short,"I purchased the software in order to be able to make a photo show and then burn it to a VCD. First the software tells me I cannot add my own music with this version, then it does not burn to make the VCD. It will burn to make a CD though. I contacted Nero for support and have had one email (which did not resolve the problem) in two weeks. I replied, but have had no response. I would look for another company who will give better support."
2,Dissapointed,"When you first attempt to use this software, it's great. It lets you build an impressive slide show, but then they sock it to you. They forgot to warn you that you can't burn your own DVD slide show, only a very limited VCD (yuck). If you want your DVD slide show on a DVD, you have to e-mail it to them and they make the DVD for you for a SMALL fee. The only way you can make your own DVD is guess what, upgrade to Slide Show 4Delux for another $ 30.00+ bucks. I don't recomend software people that feel it's necessary to deceive to sell!"
1,product support,"I tried to burn a CD for use in my TV DVD player and the order of the images was changed from the order in the slide show I had created. I have tried to use the online info and contact the tech support for this product without much luck. No responce from them in 10 days. Perhaps since this is a new product (version 1.0) they aren't up to speed in the tech support department yet, but I would have appreceated an some answer. I will update this if I get the problem solved."
1,Pepe Le Pew!!!!,"The only two good things about this movie were the costumes and sets. Everything else--the acting, the direction, the plot line (which wandered all over), were stinkers. You'd think if someone went to all the trouble of making a movie with such nice sets etc, that they'd try and get the essentials right too. Not so! I stuck through the whole movie, but it wasn't worth it. Unfortunately, I bought it without reading a review. Pew!"
4,Slow start but great read,"If you enjoy Steven Erickson you are likely to enjoy Glen Cook.It took me a while to get into this series but I have throughly enjoyed it. It plays with the concepts of technology replacing the power of magical and magical creatures. As gunpowder shifts the balance of power, and competent leaders find effective ways to apply it, the world changes.The story centers around a single character but it is realistic about that person's role in the world. Both Glen Cook and Steven Erickson write in a way that makes the characters more ""real"". Some will find this off putting as it removes the ""hero"" status of the characters."
5,Great novel,"Another amazing novel from Glen Cook. Highly recommended for all the fans of Black Company books. And why is everyone else demanding a map in their reviews? If you want to read someting, try reading an atlas next time, instead of compelling dark fantasy novel."
2,Lost and confused,"To start off with, I am huge... huge... Glen Cook fan and have every available title possible.But for some reason I am struggling to get past the first couple of chapters. I am at a point in the book that something incrediably significant has happened... and it's been explained to me why it's incrediably significant, but I am not feeling any sort of emotional attachment towards the even.I don't believe that I understand who the main characters are in the book... or even the setting of the book.Within the first 100 pages, I have jumped around to over a dozen different locations and have identified scores of different people.I am going to continue to struggle on with the novel, and take the first reviewer's advice and start reading up on my history, but that's not why I bought a science-fiction/fantasy novel."
4,A Great Summer Read!!,"I thought this book was so much fun. You won't like it if you take things too seriously... this is just meant to be a funny, lighthearted look at society women. I thought it was great. The characters are MEANT to be simple and shallow. This book honestly made me laugh out loud. It is a great, easy beach or vacation read."
1,Plum Awful!,"""Bridget Jones"" meets ""The Nanny Diaries,"" without the charm, humor, or insight of either one, and the earl-next-door channels Helen Fielding just a little too closely for comfort. Both your time and money would be much better spent with the other two books. Bergdorf Blondes is proof that good fashion journalists--which Sykes is--do not necessarily translate into good fiction writers."
3,Bergdorf Blah,"Wasn't impressed with Sykes' satirical attempt at New York socialite life. So gratuitous, one was left wondering if a personal diary, rather than a witty novel."
4,Graphic Designer,"This book was so entertaining! I actually laughed outloud on several occasions! Definitely, appreciated more by the fashion lover. Once I started reading I could not put it down! Highly entertaining!"
2,Nothing Exciting,"I love ""chick lit"" books, they are always a fast read and great entertainment but this book was terribly predictable and not exciting. It took me very long to read it and the ending was dull."
1,What a disappointment!,"I am a big fan of chick lit, so I was excited to read this much-hyped book. What mindless dribble! I read the first 60 pages, then tossed it aside. Absolutely no substance. Bergdorf Blondes was so not the fun, summer read I had hoped it would be."
1,Awful book!,I bought this book expecting more since Sex In the City had some good writing. This book is trash and is the worst piece of literature I have ever picked up. Save your money and do not waste it on this book!
3,Chick Lit Takes on Manhattan,"""Bergdorf Blondes"" takes the reader into the world of Park Avenue princesses and New York celebutantes. The narrator, known simply as ""moi,"" is considered the ""champagne bubble girl of the moment."" She and her best friend Julie Bergdorf, the perfect Park Avenue blonde, run around New York attending charity balls, restaurant openings, and high profile baby showers. They dress perfectly and eat nothing. They spend ample amounts of time with other perfect dressers and talk about clothes, the food they don't eat, and men.While I liked this book and found the numerous anecdotes about Manhattan amusing, I was disappointed that the characters never grew. Perhaps that was point.However, I would still recommend to lovers of chick lit everywhere (and those who read W and Vogue and Harpers) as the book goes into tremendous depth about a very shallow world. It is fun--and it is also a fast read."
3,I Miss New York!,"I purchased this book at the Goodwill. Because I'm so homesick for New York, I choose to read most chick lit that takes me down memory lane. When the author names a particular street, restaurant and/or hotel, I immediately draw into my memory bank and can visualize actually what she's talking about. That part was good, the bad part was the constant celebrity and clothing/shoe designer name-dropping. It was overkill!"
3,Borderline library book... but a nice afternoon read,"I actually hunted this book down at a used bookstore because I was concerned about whether it was worth buying new. I feel that was probably the right decision. I enjoyed the read, but I felt the book lacked a character or depth. Or maybe I'm looking at it wrong. It could be that our narrator isn't supposed to have any depth. Whichever it may be, I wanted to finish the book as much as I wanted to read it in the first place.Let's just say that if you're dying to read all about the shallow world of socialites, pick this up anwhere you can find it. But if you want depth, don't bother. I love reading about socialites, so I am glad I bought it so I can read it again. But I will definitely check Ms. Sykes' next book out from the library. Her writing is not exactly ""buy-worthy""..."
1,industry connections + clever title = bestseller,"I am still scratching my head in amazement that this book made it to the printing press. Forget about the fact that there is no character development, story line or sustainable plot -- the grammar is flawed throughout and the juvenile euphemisms for words like ""sex"" are awful. Does this even qualify as an easy beach read? It was painful to finish! What Bergdorf Blondes offers most of all is proof that connections are EVERYTHING."
2,Tres' Cliche',"The only thing I gleaned from this book were the names of some designers so I could look for bargains on E-bay...otherwise, so utterly predictable and unlikley a plot(?) if that is not being too kind a word...of course you know that as soon as the main character (aren't the main characers supposed to be ultimately likable-I am a writer and learned this, if nothing else) meets a man she just can't stand, that she will, of course, end up with him. Gee, how original. The only thing in this book remotely original is perhaps, some of the clothing...But I am sure it will sell millions of copies...others (too many others) have done this story already...not all that exciting to those of us who live normal lives...gives shallow a new meaning..."
3,Amusing satire of Park Avenue Princesses,"What seems to be an exeptionally shallow beginning turns into a whirlwind of adventure for ""Moi"" the narrator and her fellow Park Avenue Princess friends. Once you get past the first 50 pages, you really become engaged in the socialite world of Manhattan PAP's. Julie, a department store heiress and best friend of the narrator makes you want to strangle her for her dilluted version of the real world. The only character that seems to have any depth would be Charlie, who makes the book worth reading.This satire of the upper class twenty-somethings dives into world issues such as globe trotting, chanel sample sales and shame attacks as well as prospective husbands.With an endless amount of cash and a severe addiction to material items, you'll be glad you have a 9-5 when you're done reading it.Overall, the book was amusing."
4,Good summer chick lit...,"... if you're into that sort of thing. I usually don't write reviews, although I do like to read them. After finishing this book, I logged onto Amazon to see what others thought, expecting a 4-5 star review since that's about what every book has on Amazon, no matter how well I liked it. When I saw so many one star reviews I was surprised. By picking up the book and looking at the cover, you know from the get-go what you're getting into. Fluffy, fun, happily ever after, etc. I started on one day and enjoyed it enough to finish it one day later. I think a book that can keep my attention enough to finish it so quickly deserves a slightly higher than average rating. Hope you like it, too!"
1,Typical Fluff,"This is another name-dropping book along the lines of the ""Nanny Diaries"" about the posh life of Upper East Side women. Ms. Sykes mentions in great detail the over exhausted shops and spas of NYC, Bliss Spa, Magnolia Bakery, and Alpha-Beta peels from Dr. Dennis Gross, etc... Unfortunately, this book lacks a plot and just rambles on about vapid characters."
5,Couldn't put it down,This book is perfect for a hopeless romantic with a sense of couture. Reality was set aside in order to indulge into the life of a Bergdorf Blonde. A constant smile was on my face as I read about Bellini's and Vera Wang wedding dresses. To all those who dismember this book: If you think it was so predictable then go read a mystery. Stop being so close minded. You are the people that these fictional characters make fun of.
2,Extremely Disappointed,"I've been on the waiting list for Bergdorf Blondes for months after I saw the book at Borders and I have to say....I'm SO glad I did not buy this book. Now I love the world of the rich like the next person, especially those who live in NY, but I have to say Skyes REALLY took her life and ran with it. Not that her world doesn't exist, but it seemed SO extravagant I ended up being turned off by it. Maybe this book is just a little to ""rich"" for my blood, but I am really disappointed after the wait."
2,Tries to be 'Clueless' grows up but misses the mark,"I think the author tried too hard to recreate Cher from Clueless. She even mentions the movie in her ""novel"". There is also an allusion to Azzedine Alaia dresses but this lacks the heart and sweetness of 'Clueless'. Although it is entertaining enough I am near the end of the book and feel as if I am reading a Harlequin romance in better packaging. It has the same thinly-veiled storyline. I don't know if I will even finish it, this book is that predictable."
2,Dumb Bergdorf Blondes,"I got this book because I like reading the Plum Sykes articles in Vogue magazine. However, this book... well. I started to read this book and was shocked, SHOCKED(!) at how AWFUL it was. How could she get this published! I was ready to return it... then I decided to give a go and read the rest. I found myself rather entertained by this silly novel by the end of it. I give it 2 stars because it kind of won me over (a bit) but Plum can do better."
3,still reading,"i am currently reading this book, but so far it is as expected from this author, it is an easy read and very interesting."
1,"oof, avoid this book for several reasons","this book is extremely poorly written. she admits she wrote it and got information from watching court tv tapes and heaping on observations (mostly one sided). it's got more than a few inaccuracies and dramatic twists that just don't bear out as the truth.also enjoyable is where she criticizes a lawyer for 1. being a yankee and 2. challenging a detective's credentials on the stand doggedly. 2011 update -- the detective was found to be lying about his credentials, and the accused is freed because of it.very much a hack piece. even if it were more accurate, had fewer grammatical errors, the writing style itself is hard to read."
2,"Interesting story, but the book needed improvement","The saving grace for this book is that the story is interesting. Parts of the book were fairly well written, but much of it wasn't. There were so many typos that I wondered if it had actually been edited. But, the misusage of words was what bothered me the most. For example, the author continuously used the word ""podium"" in place of ""lectern."" A podium is defined as something a presenter stands upon. I found myself laughing hysterically when I read about one of the attorneys pounding his finger on the podium. I thought the image of this grown man bent over and pounding his finger next to his feet in a courtroom was quite comical. I also thought it was incredible that a published author would use words without knowing their meanings."
4,Written in Blood,I thought the book was fascinating. It definitely appears to be written from the view that the guy definitely did it and it is very strange that two women in his life seem to have died in very similar ways. At least that was the claim. Another interesting thing is that there is a documentary on you tube with the actual people from this book.
5,Wonderful Delicious Chips - Addictive,These are just so good. They are my favorite chip and too addictive. The beer adds a savory flavor that rounds out the cheese flavor without losing the intensity. Reminds me of when we lived on the Minnesota/Wisconsin border and had cheddar-beer soup. Wonderful!
3,Okay,"On a scale of 1-10, if Lays gets a 1 and Death Rain gets a 10, this is about a 5. Pros: very crunchy Cons: cheddar and beer tastes are pretty much indetectable."
1,hmmmm,"if you you know the basics of how to stretch and warm up, and have ever hit a punching bag before, think twice, not much to see here. good job to amazon for the quick delivery though!"
4,Excellant to refer back to....,"Great job and brillant witty writing skills. The humor was quite a treat in this ""psychic"" type book. Todays psychics are no longer mystical or leering beings hid behind a door on the side of the building. (Thank Heavens) Being a practicing psychic myself, I come across many young beginning psychics. If you are not aware of the psychic abilities, they may appear as many different things... General illnesses, confusion, even frustration. There is more than meets the eye to being diagnosed ""psychic"". Once you realize you are sensitive, then you must learn some basic skills. Psychic protection How to Meditate Connecting to the source... Stacey explains all of this. Easy to understand, and fun reading! Way to go. Lots of learning and the teaching is kept light and easy to catch on from Stacey."
2,Awful textbook,The answers to the practice problems are full of mistakes. The binding is weak and starts to fall apart after a semesters use. The graphs and charts are alright and that's the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.
2,I thought this book was lacking in alot of areas...,"Not only does the author expect you to follow along no problem while he throws out all these expressions, but he also makes ALOT of mistakes. There are alot, and I mean alot, of mistakes in the example problems and the problems at the end of the chapter. Very difficult book to follow. Not really all that good for design work if some of his expressions he derives are wrong from the get go."
2,Too broad to be a good book,"The author makes too much emphasis on Fourier transform to deduct his results but this approach does not give a chance for another mathematical approaches.Generally speaking is a good ""reference"" book for undergrad."
1,Needs to be corrected,"The poins touched by this book are good, however, I bought this book due to I use on class. Since 2nd. edition I found a lot of errors on the result pages as well some unclear steps on the text. I wrote to the author and he just say: ""sent me the errors to correct them""...should I be co-author of this book or what??If you're going to buy it, make a second tought."
5,Fabulous CD,Yolanda Kondonassis is the very best of world harpists. You will not be disappointed. This is fabulous.
1,Junk,I purchased this knife based on other reviews. It has no power. I couldn't even cut through the ribs of a catfish. Mine went back. Hope this helps others.
3,"Good Earth Lighting 12-Foot Rope Lighting, Clear","I was very happy when I received the three 12 ft. rope lights. They were installed and turned on for a several hours and turned off. The next evening they were turned on and one of the three ropes failed to turn on completely. There was a big blank space with no shining lights. So I guess you buy three, you hope that at least two will work. I was very disappointed.Good Earth Lighting G9512CLR-I 12-Foot Rope Lighting, Clear"
3,Unlit,I ordered two lengths of the Good Earth Lighting. One at 100' and the other a 12' section. Upon plugging the longer section into an outlet for the first time the last 3 feet of the lights failed to burn. Quite a disappointment.
4,Decent...,"I use it as backlighting for my desk when I'm writing code at night (eases eye strain). It works, but the plastic is very stiff and difficult to hang properly if you aren't going to secure it with something permanent (read: brackets and/or staples/nails). I will buy it again for my other desk."
4,5 good 1 not,"ordered 6 strands of this rope lighting for my front porch, and when i plugged them in, one of the strands kept blowing the small fuse inside the plug. the rope was shorted somewhere internally, so i ended up with 5 strands instead of six."
5,Great DVD,"Great entertainment, great quality. It's fun to see how the Strip looked back in the 70's. It's different than the run-of-the-mill detective shows. Plan to purchase additional seasons of the show when they go on sale."
3,"Good Game, But Bad Rules","Overall its a good game, however there are some major flaws with the rules. There is now a hierarchy within the monster types (i.e. Water will always take out fire monsters etc). Although I understand these rules, I don't like them. I summoned a 2400 atk monster (including having to sacrifice 2 monsters as a tribute), only to have a 300 atk monster take it out. Good Idea but not that good. Maybe they should have given superior monster types only a 500 point bonus rather then it will always destroy it.Plus its a very hard game to get a better deck. You are playing NPC's a plenty and only getting lots of rather pathetic cards.All in all there is longievity but at what cost to the gamers sanity?"
3,BoogaBooga Land,"I was so excited to be able to review a DVD for booksneeze.com this go round. I love getting books, but a video that my children could actually help review was even more fun. We popped it in the DVD player as soon as it came in the mail.The adventures are meant to follow stories in the Bible. There are 3 stories in this DVD:- Squid Sushi Loses His Marbles (The Valuable Pearl - Matt 13:45-46)- Wally the Waiter (The Weeds - Matt 13:24-30)- The Flaming Monkey (The Wedding Banquet - Matt 22:2-14)My children thought the video was great. I personally didn't follow the story line very well. I thought the Bible lesson would jump out a little more than it did. That just didn't happen. Granted, this is definitely not a Hermie and Friends DVD, but it definitely kept the children's attention and they requested to watch it again.I received a complimentary copy of this DVD for reviewing purposes from booksneeze.com. All opinions expressed in this review are my own. I was not paid for this review."
3,a good idea,This was a good idea but lacking. My oldest wanted nothing to do with this and my 4 year old got bored half way through. This is cool that they can watch it and learn about God but they lost interest quickly. I like the idea that it is in a kid friendly format. my son was drawn to the case for the cover picture.
1,Did not fit!,"This did not fit as described or shown on the web, if you have the larger ironing board, do not get this, it will not work!"
2,Size matters,"Make sure that you match your Rowenta board number to the cover; they make another cover with the exact same dimensions stated that does not fit the professional model, and has no straps underneath. I agree about washing it. Don't! It will shrink and no longer fit. Quality is overstated. It's just OK."
4,Good quality cover - one of the few for wide boards!,"Good product - the only reason it isn't five stars is that the velcro fasteners under the board do not hold well, and I'm going to have to either sew them on or find another method."
3,It is not like the Original Cover,"I bought this 2 year ago, and somehow it will not, and never did fit my ironing board the way the original did. It is not also as thick as the original one. Overall is OK."
1,Wrong album,"This is a very poor compilation of Italo disco faves Fun Fun, as it only contains short versions of their hits and is therefore a waste of a CD (this is dance music, and no Italo fan wants to hear 3 minute versions!). You don't even get to see any pictures of the lovely girls themselves on the cover. The tracklisting Amazon have posted is wrong, here's what you really get:One Day 5:56Baila Bolero 3:56Gimme Some Loving 3:44Color my love 3:58Happy Station 3:17Capital Girl 3:45Give me your love 3:55Could this be love 3:58Give me Love 4:10Fun Fun Hit-Mix Medley 5:40Very poor, so my advice would be to get the Hot Productions ""Best of Fun Fun"" CD instead, which is also for sale on Amazon."
3,The Mermaids Singing,"Not a great choice for late night reading at home alone! This McDermid offering is much too graphic in its details of torture for my taste and I can only imagine researching this mystery must have been nauseating. That said, Mermaids had a great story line and nice twist in the ending."
3,Disappointingly Mediocre,"Despite being a Kevin Smith fanboy myself, I still could not muster up much enthusiasm for the second of his Evening With Kevin Smith dvds. I would recommend the first one to almost anyone. It is gut-bustingly hilarious throughout with a good dose of inside humor. But this one is almost sad at times in how unfunny it is. I would like to think that Kevin was just having a bad day (twice), not the depressing idea that he may have already spilled his good ""stories"" on the first one. This is for K.S. fanatics and completists only."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"I don't regret taking the time to watch Evening Harder, it gave me plenty of chuckles, but I think it is fair to say that the adulation Kevin Smith gets from his audience has gone to his head. He dispenses vulgarity like meat to a pack of hungry dogs and tries to make fun of every single person who asks a question this time around even when there's nothing there to make fun of. One guy asks a concise two-part question, in response Smith makes a crack about it being a 46-part question. However inconsistent it is compared to the original Evening With DVD, the way Smith uses audience questions to segue into barely relevent prepared monologues shows he could have a successful career as a stand-up comic if the film thing hadn't worked out."
4,Interesting and entertaining,"While written in a very breezy style, this title contains a surprising amount of information on what goes into a good moviecar chase, and the various people who combine to create it (directors, stunt co-ordinators, cameramen, drivers, actors etc). Some good illustrations, from the fifties through to toaday. The author's top 20 chases are well chosen, and I for one won't argue with Bullitt as number 1. An appendix of some sort, with a more complete listing of movies and ""who did what"" would have been a useful addition, although I guess IMDB can help here."
4,Our dog loves these,"We've tried a lot of different treats for our dog. Some are more successful than others, but these ones seem to be a hit even after the novelty of them has worn off. While there is some debate on chicken treats for dogs that have come from China, the Dogswell people have very high standards for their treats and they are sold at Whole Foods -- who are in themselves very picky about their vendors and the quality of the products sold at their stores.Your dog will love these treats -- and our dog's coat certainly has never looked better!"
4,The Betsy,"Most enjoyable and well acted. Just a bit dated now that Ontario Speedway is history, no computers, cellphones etc. How refreshing is that?"
1,Just an ad for a supplement company,"This is such a bad book I don't know where to begin. The science is sophamoric at best. The writing is junior high school level. But the worst is the blatant pushing of their product. I think Amazon should be blamed for not telling the buyer that the book is an ad for a product, not a serious nutrition book."
4,Actron 9145 Cable Extender,"This cable should come with the kit. I don't know why it doesn't. While hooking up the scanner with the supplied cable can be done, often times it is rather awkward to read due to the final position the user has to assume to read the screen. This extender cable enables the user to be in a much more comfortable position inside or outside the vehicle while using the scanner. If you use the scanner often I would highly recommend using this cable extender."
2,A tough read,"I found this book to be a tough read and in the end not as helpful as I thought it would be. The principles for living a good life and seeking nirvana are similar to other religions but the writing style and way of expressing them are difficult to understand fully. In the end I found the principles of buddism interesting but kept saying to myself ""so who made all this up?"" rather than feeling that I had found a guide for my life that was more useful than many others."
4,Easy mounting and good fit,Easy mounting and correct size (these tires can be a few mm large or small). Has held up very well
3,Galileo,"After reading this play it makes you appreciate how much freedom is in our world now. I think Bertolt Brecht did a good job of showing the dangers of being a researcher in those olden days. It was actually kinda scary how the church would rather kill people to keep their high figures then accept the truth. Many people were scared of the truth. I was proud of Galileo who kept on researching even thought he knew there would be consequences. There was some bad parts of the play however, at some parts it was extremely hard to follow due to the language in which the characters speak in and some times you had no idea what was going on. I recommend this book to someone who wants to learn more about Galileo or to someone who wants to learn about how the churched ruled everyone's life."
1,This is the worst book I have ever read!,I cannot begin to relate how much I hated this book. The main character was needlessly cruel to people who do not deserve such treatment. The only scenes even remotely funny occurred at the end of the book when Grand actually takes on people deserving his peculiar tortures. I read this for a book group and the twelve of us agree the only thing good about this book is the very short length.
2,Slippers,These slippers run real small. I cannot wear them as my toes rub up against the sole of the slipper.
3,Daniel Green slippers,Daniel Green Women's Tracey washable slippers were a disappointment. I ordered them in a wider width becase my feet were swollen and in a slightly larger size. The were bulky and felt slightly short in the toe. They were heavier quality than the Dearfoams but often I felt the bottom rubber stuck to the floor and I was afraid I would trip and fall. They did not live up to my expectations.
4,good Deal,I found this game to be fun but there are some drawbacks. The game would be better if the screen was backlit somehow otherwise you need some lighting to play and see the numbers. Also the numbers and cases are a bit small which also makes them hard to see. But overall it is good game for the price.
3,Losing interest.,"This was purchased for our 10 year old. She is certainly able to play the game and has watched the TV version and enjoys it on TV. However, this handheld hasn't held her attention much. In fact, it is more enjoyed by the older kids and adults in our family. The on button seems to have a little bit of a problem on it. Myself (mom), I can play it all day! Crazy...."
3,Review of the Blu-Ray version,"This is strictly a review of the Blu-ray product and not how awesome the show is, which it is.(My setup, Panasonic 42"" Viera Plasma and PS3)The picture quality from episode to episode is very inconsistent quality wise. The pilot episode is HD goodness, but many of the regular episodes are some of the worst HD quality I have seen so far come out on blu-ray for a TV show. Those episode look more like upscan SD version. One major problem with the picture quality is the grain, in one episode it is SO bad its impossible to ignore. I can't in all honesty recommend purchasing this product. You are better off getting the DVD instead and not being doped into buying a HD product that doesn't really provide consistent or real HD quality."
5,Chuck rules!,"I really enjoy Chuck. He is Everyman, caught up in situations beyond his sphere of experience. But Chuck rises to every occasion--often with fear and trembling--and somehow survives. The cast, many of whom were new to me, is great."
4,Surprisingly good,"thought I was gonna hate it, wound up being a favourite. my husband and i both enjoy it immensely. witty with action and just fun to watch. takes 3 episodes to get you hooked, so be patient, you'll be glad you were"
4,The pilot is Awesome!,I think the chase scene in the pilot is the best chase scene I have seen in any movie or t.v. show.
2,The show is great. The Blu-Ray is not.,"Having watched the show from the beginning, and now re-watching it after its end, Chuck is a great series with humor, action, and great writing. Few shows have such a grand sense of story arc - seasons are complete stories, not just weekly episodes. Even just watching the first episode after watching the last shows how brilliant the writing on this show was.I have the DVD of season two, but thought I'd splurge on the Blu-Ray for season 1. Big mistake. Everything about the Blu-Ray is inferior. The menus do not allow you to access individual episodes. The video quality is poor. The first disc has over 4 hours on it, which is really pushing how much compression HD could take. My impression is that the DVD video is cleaner, or at least equal to the Blu-Ray.NBC isn't known for great HD, but this is a travesty. Save your money and buy the DVD version. You won't be missing anything."
2,THIS is Blu-Ray?,"To start, Chuck is one of my favorite show. This Blu-Ray, however, is one of the worst looking things I have ever seen. I recently bought a PS3 Slim and this was my first foray in to the land of Blu-Ray movies or television series. In this land, there be monsters. From persistent noise in the shot to the lack of a menu for choosing the episode that you want to watch this is an abomination that would be in the $5 bin at Chuck's Buy-More. Do yourself a favor and catch the older episodes that NBC has recently re-posted on-line. Get your RDA of Chuck without shelling out your hard-earned simoleans on this POS."
3,Mechandise Damaged,"The product itself is fine, but the package came to my door mangled. The envelope had been torn and the DVD case cracked and plastic shattered. I hope this was simply a mailing error and not reflective of amazon.com."
3,"Awesome Show, Awful DVD","Chuck is a fun show. Its got action, comedy, and a little drama. I was wanting the blu-ray version, but read that the quality was bad so i opted out for the dvd. However the dvd version is pretty ugly itself. Some scenes are sooo grainy its hard to watch. But if you like this show its worth the purchase."
5,Grows on you,"I guess season one isn't the best representation of the ""awesomeness"" of Chuck (it really takes off in seasons 2 and 3), but I understand you have to start somewhere and they need to develop characters before they can really start the good stuff. I definitely recommend it, though!!"
3,Disappointing,"I got this album @ the Virgin MegaStore in Chicago and me being a Kylie fan I was disappointed with this album, there aren't that many good songs and I skipped over a bunch of them except Word Is Out, Give Me Just A Little More Time, Finer Feeling & If You Were With Me Now. The other songs were just plain boring."
4,Essential For Mexico Travel,"We recentely rented a car for our vacation in Cabo San Lucas and brought our Garmin GPS loaded with the Mexico Street Maps. I am so glad we had this as we most likely would have been constantly lost. The maps were very accurate with regards to the street navagation. The only downfall of the maps was that a signifigant amount of restaurants etc. were missing from the database but I was OK with working around that. The cities are full of narrow, crowded one way streets so just having a funtional GPS to guide us was well worh the cost of the maps. By renting a car we saved several hundred dollars in taxi fare. Round trip taxi fare from the airport to the hotel zone alone was around $150 so you can imagine the Mexico Street Maps more than paid for itsef after a week of driving."
3,Peculiar accent,"The item is Garmin Navigator for Mexico. It does OK in Guadalajara but in the countryside where I live, not so hot. For example, it tells me the nearest gas station is 12 miles towards the airport when there are 3 within a couple of miles of my house. Also, the voice announcements have the most preposterous accent I have ever heard. No attempt to get accents in the right place so that Chapala sounds like Chápala, which is all but unrecognizable. Also pronounces j as in English. It will get a better accuracy test in a couple of weeks when I head to the border (US) for a visit with family and friends."
4,"Great book, but not what I expected","Before you buy this book, know it is a DEVOTIONAL. I thought it was a parenting book. It's not. It's still a fantastic book, just not what I expected.The author is funny and down-to-earth. She highlights the divine in the mundane, drawing readers into a more personal awareness of God in the midst of everyday chaos of parenting. It's a drink of cool water to a parched soul.The chapters are short, most just three pages. Each begins with a personal story then evolves into an applicable reflection of what God wants for us. It's the perfect format for busy moms.Final Thoughts: Intellectual, witty and relevant. Definitely recommended."
3,Long winded Thoreau,"Thoreau was an intelligent man but he also was a bit concieted. The first few chapters are the worse, he goes on and on about how much smarter he is than other people. I really enjoyed the chapters where he describes his natural surroundings. Even though he believes his man should listen to his own drummer, he is very critical of city dwellers.I think everyone should read this book once just to know what it is about."
3,I loved it at first but not for long....,After reading all the reviews about the Sun's Tea Infuser & Mug on Amazon I decided to get one for myself about 3 weeks ago. I loved the mug right away and I was really enjoying drinking a tea from it. I was a little surprised though how thin the glass was so I was handling it gently especially during washing it. After about ten days of using it I noticed a crack on the bottom side of infuser. I was so disapointed as I don't even know when and how it happened. Obviously I stopped using it as I was afraid it will break once I put how water to it. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend..
4,good,It has good quarlity but i feel the price is a little expensive. Anyway it's good. And I like it.
4,Works Amazing. Can Break.,"I love my loose leaf tea, and I've owned this baby for a little over a year.The all glass is very nice, doesn't carry over any taste; however it is not the most durable material.I dropped the top of mine from only about the height of the glass and the little ball on top broke.I managed to glue it up and it works. I still use it sometimes, but I got another clay one that is much more durable.Pros: Perfect for one cup of tea. Glass is nice for taste and to see the tea.Cons: Can break rather easily, especially the top."
3,Beware of the violence,"I have read all of Brockmann's books and liked/loved 90% of them. ""Into the Storm"" is a return of interesting characters, laugh-out-loud humor, and an interesting plot (although the ""I can't tell you how much I love you and instead must avoid you because it's for your own good"" strand is getting so old). However, beware if grisley torture haunts you, as it does me. I thought that I could just lightly skim the serial murderer chapters, but I still picked up unwanted, hideous specifics. Although these chapters are generally short, they include gruesome details (right up there with some of Stephen King's and reminded me of ""The Silence of the Lambs)."
3,"A Basic Guide to Writing, Selling, and Promoting Children's Books : Plus Information about Self-publishing",I didn't realize that this book was a small 38 page book. Even though it has an ISBN number....it looks like someone printed it out from their computer and stapled it together. There are a few good points listed in the book....but I think it should have been a little longer....or at least each subject discussed should of had a little more detail.
4,Great for Road Trips!,"We got this b/c our baby loves his big crib mobile, and we were taking a long car trip. I love that it is battery powered and that you can play it with or without music. He really loves it! My only complaint is that it hangs pretty low, but he doesn't seem to mind. It was an excellent buy."
2,Disappointed,After purchasing this item on Amazon i was very disappointed with is proformance. For some reason i had to replace the batteries after a week of use. I used brand new Energizers so i know it wasn't my fault for buying cheap batteries. My 3 month old daughter for some reason didn't respond or play with this item. Mayber she is too young to understand or be distracted with this toy... honestly i have mixed feeling about this item because of its price.
3,"Cute, but doesn't fit our Graco Snugride Carseat!","I was so excited to get this mobile to use on our carseat for baby. However, the strap is not long enough to go around the handle of our Graco Snugride. It runs out of velcro and only hangs by a thread.....which can easily be pulled off. It is also kind of expensive for a little toy."
3,Soothing but be careful what you use it for...,"This is a very useful product for keeping a child calm in a car seat. It is great for use in restaurants or supermarkets when your child is still young enough to be kept in an infant car seat. However, nothing should EVER be attached to a car seat handle while the car is in motion. First, your car seat handle should be placed behind the hood of the car seat while the car is in motion. If this toy were to be attached to a handle during an accident, it would slam into your child's face. While it may seem secure, it could become a dangerous projectile during a crash. So, while this is a great toy for very specific uses, be careful and resist the temptation to attach it or anything else to your baby's car seat while you are driving."
5,Very Sexy,the painting of the swimsuits was one of my favorite moments of the show.the video is done in a tasteful way.the models included in the video are great looking even though there are some i don't think are that hot but what makes up for it is Marisa Miller being in the video.
4,Still here,"This book came out quite a while back and it's still around. The reason for this probably has more to do with the wonderful character of Binx Bolling that it does with the over-all effect of the book itself.Binx is a sort of ""Babbitt"" although in an entirely different setting and with a different job. He's a wonderful character study of what happens to men (whether or not they want to admit it) and I doubt some of the younger generation will be able to relate to him or sympathize.Still, the book as a whole is great and you should enjoy it even if you're not lusting after your secretary in hot and sultry New Orleans.This book should be read, along with CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES and McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD"
2,Slow Paced,"I read this book with a friend who I discuss books with at the library every month and I have to say I had to really struggle to finish it. This book is very slow paced and I lost interest very quickly.When Binx talked about his search in the beginning I was interested on where this would lead but afterwards there really wasn't any more mentions of his search. Most of the characters were kind of bland and I couldn't care for them with one exception, Lonnie, Binx's handicapped half brother. I'm sorry to say that I didn't really like this book because I really had high expectations for it."
1,Supplier was disappointing,"Although Amazon indicated this supplier had the product, after the product was ordered, I received notice from the supplier that they are out of the product. However, the supplier managed to send me another item and charged me for shipping of a product I did not want without the product out of supply. I am very disappointed with this vendor."
3,too wide,"the capezio 205 ballet shoe is true to size, my daughter is a size 10 and i bought the 11m so that there is room to grow. The shoe is just a little big with enough room to last a year. But the width is very wide, it is loose in the sides not a snug fit that ballet shoes are suppose to be."
2,We don't like them,"These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet. They don't ""hug"" her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly. Not pretty at all. They are also difficult to tie. I expected a better product from Capezio. On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color."
2,Go to a live store,"The delivery here was excellent, the shoe itself was fine; however, the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all, and she is a petite little girl. I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small. Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size, which also gives her a little wiggle room. Go to a local store if you have one, otherwise you'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe doesn't fit."
3,"good materials and construction, very wide","I purchased the 11.5 W which is my daughter's standard size. The length was good but the shoe is super wide and gaps all around. She is only 3 so it doesn't really matter but it is really, really wide."
5,Sizing,For everyone who is having sizing issues- as a dancer- that is normal for a ballet shoe. They have different sizing. You should always get fitted for correct size as they will also stretch out as you dance and do not want them to loose when you buy them.
3,Shoes would have been perfect but...,The shoes were not true to size. I would recommend ordering a smaller size than the actual shoe size. I followed what everyone else said by ordering the bigger size and in all actuality i should have ordered her correct size or even a size smaller. Other than that they seem to have been great shoes.
4,Capezio Ballet slippers,"Once I got the size straight they worked out great. The wide, medium and narrow threw me off. Ended up with the next size up and medium width for a good fit.She loves them."
5,Quality product!,"I purchased the ballet slippers for my granddaughter. They tend to run a size smaller than the size listed, so I had to send back the 6 and order a 7.5 for room to grow. Perfect!Thank you!"
4,good shoes,these are good ballet slippers for the beginning and young ballet students. we have used this brand and style since my daughter started ballet at 3 and she is 6 1/2 now and they have held up well with classes and recitals.
5,Good ballet shoe,Fits my daughter well and she enjoys them. Good ballet shoe for a beginning ballerina. Great deal for the price!
4,AFI's Best Release,"Throughout their career, AFI seems to have struggled between whether they want to be punk or gothic. With All Hallow's E.P. they manage to pull both off seamlessly. The Misfits are the obvious inspiration here - they even cover their classic ""Halloween."" Amazingly, their cover is very good. For most of the album's 4 songs, they take the creepy-punk banner the Misfits created and run with it, creating a style all their own. Even though it's only an E.P, AFI has never equaled this CD."
5,Best E.P. Ever!!!,"This is amazing! Davey Havok sounds perfect! All the songs are great:Fall Children- Davey starts out singing really slow and low, and then the songs blasts right into energy!Halloween- Well, i didn't like the Misfits version at all, AFI made it sooo much better! now it's one of my favorite songs.Boy Who Destroyed The World- Love this song, so full of energy, and very catchy.Totalimmortal- Amazing song! Offspring tried to copy it, but didn't do very well, if you heard the Offspring version, but not The AFI version... listen to the AFI version before you say if the song is good or bad.This E.P. is worth every penny! ( and it's only 4 dollars)AFI is the best!!"
5,"Great, but short","Every song on this CD is awesome, but there are only 4. It would have been better if they could have put these songs on ""black sails..."" or ""art of drowning"", but oh well. It's cheap, so get it."
3,Pretty but...,The Royal Albert collectible tea cup and saucer are attractive and my daughters enjoy using them for our tea parties. But I felt the quality of the gold trim and the attention to detail wasn't there. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,less is sometimes more,"The Necks are a unique proposition , not really jazz and not really rock, they do however always deliver the goods.Track one could be described as sounding like a jam between members of Can and Pink Floyd ( pre Dark Side ) and sets the tone for the second, and I think more poweful track where the magic starts to happen. The very subtle use of Hurdy Gurdy mixed in and out of the wash of Keyboards,Bass and percussion creates something really special.These guys are sadly underrated, and you will be amply rewarded by the purchase of this disc."
4,Best of artist...,"Vince's first solo outing finds him in the dangerous company of Steve Stevens,who delivers blow after blow on this excellent album.Even though it came out at the wrong time(1993),this little rock experience is worth banking on:the fine guitar work heard on some of Billy Idol's albums and the attitude of Motley Crue combine wonderfully here."
2,Great show ... but a disappointing DVD package,"I totally agree with the negative comments of other reviewers. Love the series, was expecting a solid DVD treatment based on the look of the packaging, but there are too many problems. For example: abrupt cuts between scenes, no opening credits for each episode (as noted elsewhere, every LHOTP episode had episode-specific cast-of-characters details in the opening credits--try to find the names of the guest stars on these DVDs!), inconsistent picture quality, etc. Still happy that I have a few seasons on DVD now ... but I'll be upset if one day soon a new distributor releases an excellent (i.e. the standard quality DVD viewers have come to expect) version of LHOTP."
2,Show is great; dvd quality is NOT,"We love this series and was happy to find season 2 on DVD to purchase. However, after just attempting to watch the first dvd, the sound quality is HORRIBLE!! We cranked the volume to as high as it would go and still couldn't hear the characters' voices. Then without warning, the audio would kick back in and the sound would be normal. Thought it could be our TV but no other dvds or TV shows have this issue...ONLY these dvds. Realized then the last set we bought from LHOTP(season 1) had the same audio issues. Hopefully some other company produces this on DVD with better sound quality because this is WORTHLESS if you can't hear anything!!"
4,Great Stories/Inconsistent Quality,"I grew up with LHOP. Now my children (6 and 9) are watching the series, and LOVE all the stories. We have made Friday and Saturday nights, LHOP movie night.The quality of the transfer to DVD is inconsistent. Some of the episodes, the sound is so bad, it is impossible to understand. The image quality is what you would expect from an old show... but in some episodes the images are so dark.Even so, we keep buying these because the stories are timeless. The characters are rich and complex, the acting is great, the stories are moving."
5,It had me in the first few pages,"Luckily it was a Sunday and there was nothing to do when I started the book because it was impossible to put down until the entire story was told. In 278 pages there was so much information about the investigation, the family dynamics, relationships with the neighbors, an unraveling personality and the impact the crime had on all the people involved.Diane Fanning sure can tell a true crime story."
1,What?????!!!!!??????,I'm a fan of true crime books but have never read this author and will not ever again! This was horribly written and Diane Fanning is obviously not a seasoned author. To me it wasn't like I was reading a story it was like reading the author's notes that she had jotted down. I'm interested in the story since I'm in the San Antonio area and will look to see if I can find it written by a different author. I just can't finish this one. A waste of $8.00.
5,Lark Rise to Candleford,"This book is most entertaining. A friend recommended I read this, since I enjoyed the Miss Read ""Fairacre"" series so much. I was not disappointed, to say the least."
3,nineteenth century England,"If you'd like a detailed look into nineteenth small town England, this is interesting. It is a bit boring however in detail. The characters are not as interesting in the book as the TV series of the same name. The TV series is considerably different from the book."
5,"The Forsyte Saga, Series 2","The Sequel to the Forsyte Saga was done with perfect casting of the characters, lavish sets and sumptious costuming. It has become one of my favorite series and has inspired me to read the remaining John Galsworthy books in the Saga. Damian Lewis was absolutely perfect in the role of Soames Forsyte."
3,Great story,"This follow-up fell short of the excellence of the first series which I loved and watch frequently because of its rich characters, beautiful scenery and fantastic costumes."
5,Forsyte Saga II,"Enjoyed the ""second chapter"" of this story.Item came within a few days of ordering in great condition."
5,the Forsyte Saga 1 and 2,"Great story. Loved watching it on TV back in the 60,s (Black and white) The remake is absolutely riveting ! Lilly Bee"
3,Disappointed,"This installment bears no resemblance to Galsworthy's novel. The casting of major characters is abysmal--the actors playing Irene and Jolyon in particular appear much too young even with aging makeup. Jolyon is supposed to be twelve years older than Irene and in his seventies when he dies. The actor in this adaptation looks barely forty-five. Gina McKee is totally miscast as Irene. Irene in the novel is elegant, reserved, mysterious--an incredible beauty with regal posture, dark gold hair, and deep brown eyes. McKee is thin, coltish, stoop-shouldered with prominent teeth and squinty blue eyes. It is impossible to associate her in any way with Galsworthy's Irene. The old BBC production is much more faithful. If you've read the book, this new version will be a major disappointment."
1,junk,"I figured if it was a Klein product it would be good. How wrong I was. One side must have been bent or something, because the cutter blades nearest the grip were jamming against each other, preventing the plier from fully closing. The cutter nearer the pivot wouldn't cut 10ga. stranded automotive wire, no matter how they were adjusted/aligned. It only skinned the insulation and bent the wire. Good design, poor execution. Klein should be ashamed."
1,Not Worth Your Money,"I wish I didn't read the review of the person who wrote ""This was a good DVD"". This DVD was not worh the asking price. If you can get it used for less than $5 it would be an okay buy. The storyline was good. You had two brothers, one was a star athletic and the other was doing his own thing; battling for their father's attention and the same girl. But the acting, directing and producing is so bad you over look the storyline. The bottomline is the movie has a five star price with a one star budget. If you have seen Show Stoppers and thought it was wack, this movie is worse."
2,"The pace, man, it's all about the pace...","The movie is not a bad movie at all. Its idea is clever (no spoils here), I particularly always cheer for a M. Night Shayamalan project, because the guy is really charismatic, enthusiastic, young and competent about his job (check the extras on this DVD to see what I mean).The problem with THE VILLAGE is its atrociously slow pace. The movie weights over you like a Jumbo 747, the traditional M. Night subtle ways are not here: it's simply slow... I'm not an action movie freak, that's not the point. I undertood the mesages, the drama, etc, But the movie is simply boring at more than two thirds of its duration. It's the kin of movie that has two hours but it seems like four and, because of that, it's a movie you will probably never watch it a second time, even if you like it moderately.Enjoy at your own risk."
2,Dissapointing,"When I seen this I had already known that critics hated this film, but i decided to give it a chance, I mean how bad could an M. Night Shyamalan movie be? Needless to say, i was dissapointed with this movie. The acting is good, as it always is with his movies, the score was amazing. Thats all thats good in this film. The shock value is very low, i wasnt scared at all, the writing was awful, and the ""twist ending"" wasnt as shocking as the one in the sixth sense. I really hope his next movie is much better than this."
1,You will fall asleep...,"and if you don't you must have nothing else to do with your time. I can sum this movie up in one word. Borrrrinnngg. SO boring in fact that about 30 minutes into it i just said forget it and turned it in the next day. What really kept annoying me about this movie is the whole ""those we do not speak of"" thing . ""Those we do not speak of"" but are having a council meeting concerning them. Also i understand that the director won't show the monster for sometime in his movies (like in signs) but I got so bored with this movie that I turned it off before I even saw it (if there is one) and was then too sleepy to fast foward. Don't waste your time."
2,..........bare witches .... salem? Sabrina?,Oh GIVE ME A BREAK!what 'were they' THINKING WHEN THEY SIGNED ON BOARD?????'SLEEPY HOLLOW' WAS SO MUCH MORE FUN!!'Confused?This one's an immensely silly and self-gratifying document on the Art of Coarse non-acting ~ really!Rent this one!
4,An intellectual thriller,This is an incredible movie if you are intelligent enough to understand the ethical issues it raises.
1,MISLEADING,PLEASE M.NIGHT SHYAMALAN DO NOT PROMOTE A HORROR MOVIE TO THE PUBLIC JUST TO SELL TICKETS THE FIRST WEEK. THIS MOVIE WILL BOMB AFTER THE WORD GETS OUT OF JUST HOW PATHETIC THIS FILM IS. M.NIGHT SHOULD BE OFFERING A REFUND TO ANYONE WITH A TICKET STUB. WARNING YOU HEARD IT HERE.
1,"""Stunned is right!""","Touchstone presents a flaw with no story, no good acting, and no good characters. It's not even scary! There are no creatures, just humans dressing up, murders and it takes place in actual time! They make up this lie just because the man character, (Her Father)'s sister was raped and killed. Don't watch this! I'm warning! You! Totally not what I excpected!"
2,Great Trailer,Like 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs' before it 'The Village' has a fantastic trailer but is a boring movie.I have seriuosly had more excitement watching grass grow.It certainly isn't the worst movie I have ever seen (that goes to the remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre') but it is a huge letdown.The idea behind it would have made an excellent one hour episode of 'The X Files' but as a full length feature film it doesn't cut it.
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"The problem with this movie is the way it was promoted. One of the first cast interviews I saw was Sigourney Weaver saying how the movie was scarier than Alien and that she was having trouble sleeping at night. From that point on I could hardly wait to see The VillageSigourney Weaver was lying! as was all the hype about this movie a lie.It's too bad because it was a good movie, but because of the LIE most people are disappointed.M. Night Shyamalan could have just went with the secrecy hype and people would have liked the movie, instead as you are reading most hated it."
4,Not quite what I expected...but good,"Like most people who saw this movie, I was first attracted by the nature of the trailer when it was first released. Despite people claiming that the story wasn't really ""as advertised"" it was still an engaging film. I remember being in the theater and being completely shocked when the plot turned not once, not twice, but three times. Of course, I can't really state how this is because I don't want to ruin the story for those who haven't seen it yet. Anyways, this is NOT a horror film, but quite a thriller. I have never been in a theater where many of the viewers loudly gasped in shock.Overall, I give this movie 4 stars, even though I am a little disappointed that the creatures were not seen more."
2,It could be a better movie!! Much better!!,"The subject matter is great, but quite bad handle. And i mean that this movie could be an exciting movie but it wasn't.It's a boring movie. Lack of suspense over the 40 min, and the rest was pretty predictable."
4,One of M. Knights better movies,"If you like 6th sense but did not like Unbreakable or Signs, you will probably like this.Adrian Brody and Joaquin Phoenix are amazing."
2,Welcome To The Twilight Zone,"With all the well known great actors in this film, I expected better. It seemed like an overlong, overblown Twilight Zone episode. I guessed the ending when the Ivy's father shown what was in the shed he taken her to."
2,They Can't All Be winners,"I am very dissapointed with this movie. The Trailers made it look like it was supposed to be scary, but it wasn't. A big let-down for me because all his other flims were good and suspencefull. This one was long winded and boring. The movie kind of made the people in the village look like Cowards who cant accept what life has delt them. So i just hope that his next movie will be better."
2,Rent but Don't buy,This movie is good only once. The first time you watch it has alot of suspense and mystery but once it's over it's not worth watching again. Rent this one; you'll like it but I wouldn't buy it.
3,"It was ""interesting""","Just finished watching this.OK - I was expecting somewhat of a horror movie and that it wasn't, but it was sort of a thriller.I didn't like it as much as the other two bigs ones (Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) but this was not a horrible movie.I AM glad that I waited for DVD, though."
1,Maybe if I Were Still Pre-Adolescent...,"...I might find the ""twist"" (and I use that term very lightly) ending ""neat-o cool."" But then again, if I were still pre-adolescent, I can't imagine that I wouldn't turn this snooze-fest off after 20 minutes and pop in ""Spider-Man 2"" or my Nintendo. Honestly, did anyone (actors, studio heads, anybody) actually read this tripe before commiting to it? Why does this man get the greenlight to make such full-length idiocies? (This is the 2nd dumbest film ever made, ""Signs"" being the 1st.) There's maybe enough story to fill a half-hour Twilight Zone episode, but it's dragged out to interminable length with some of the most stilted, God-awful dialogue you'll ever hear anywhere. There are some nice performances here, but ""The Village"" is a mighty long, hard slog for a ridiculous non-payoff that's obvious many a mile off."
2,Imminently predictable.,"Come on -- I had the whole premise figured out within 20-30 minutes. Then I sat there as my predictions unfolded before me.Pretty lousy acting, too."
1,Is it really a horror movie?,"When i saw the preview of this movie, my first thoughts were creatures in the woods, how awesome, but now after i've watched it, I feel like the movie was a waste of time, to me it was a more of a romance story then a horror movie, and to find out the truth about the monsters made the movie more boring and dull. I simply would not recommend this movie because of these reasons"
1,Glad I didn't waste my money seeing this at the theater,"Thriller or not, this is just a plain bad movie. Like Signs, it is hard to appreciate the acting or characterization when the plot is nonsensical and downright insulting. The best part of the movie was when I returned it to Blockbuster this morning knowing I would never have to watch it again."
1,"Ugh, one of the worst movies ever","This movie was a complete waste of time. I remember there being much hype about it because it came from the same man that did The Sixth Sense.The hype was not well deserved. This movie actually put me to sleep; two times! Luckily, I checked it out from the library and did not waste my money on it at the video store.The ""twist"" at the end is great, like all of M. Night's movies, but by the time you get to it, you won't really care. The pace is very slow and dull, much like everything about this movie.Verdict: Don't waste your time"
2,Tries to be smart....and fails.,"Stating the good stuff in the movie: the acting and the cinematography. The bad stuff. There's nothing scary about the movie, unless you think the frightnening music is scary. The creatures look like giant sewer rats.Shyamalan seems to think he can make any movie and the audience will fall for it. The Village is an example of this. The only merit of this movie is the actors and setting. The story goes nowhere."
1,The Twist - is that this movie blows dogs for quaters,"Wow, how I totally agree with the other people's reviews. This movie was so wrongly advertised. When i went to see this movie in the movie theater I was expecting another Signs, which I thought was an awesome movie, another great horror/thriller. Well the first third of the film seemed promising but then it all turned into crap. Sorry if i am not writing intellectual enough but this movie does not deserve it. The ""twists"" were crap, that is what this movie did wrong first and foremost. I wont ruin the movie for those who havent seen it but i told myself that i ""hope this doesnt happen"" and it does. The final twist was interesting though, i honestly didnt see that coming [...]"
1,I would give this a zero if I could!!!,"I felt obligated to warn the world of this horrible movie. Never have I felt so cheated by wasting $4 to rent this! I can not stress enough how bad this was. Its not a horror movie, its not a thriller.....I would enjoy listening to Ashley Simpson more than watching this movie again! I can only think that the cast of the movie were the only ones to give this movie a good rating!"
1,"""Theres a sucker born every minute""","This movie is like hearing a joke from someonewho is fading in and out of consciousness.A straining experience with very little payoff.Shyamalan's movies seem to have a P.T. Barnum approachto them.He's doing very well proving the ""Barnum rule"" correct."
4,Worth watching,I felt this film was a departure from his previous work and taken on a purely entertainment level it was totally worth watching. Actually there is beautiful storytelling here and a deep love story interwoven with suspense and M.'s signature style-I enjoyed the film and loved the extras-it always amazes me the work that goes into a production of this scale-I don't understand why people are bashing this movie-I realize it's not the sixth sense but it is truly a very good piece of film making.
1,Try your best not to scream... with disappointment,"After all the hype surrounding this movie, I was hoping that this movie would scare me more than the ring, but it was more boring than anything. What a disappointment! The Mario 3 Koopa looking thing was scary for about 5 minutes, but the rest of it was really slow. This movie's a good candidate for rental but save yourself the money and agony and watch it then."
3,Pretty Decent.....But Kinda Boring,"I jus watched this today, I thought it had a couple of moments, and it was pretty decent, but boring, not worth buying. prolly renting.Overrall:Nothing but a decent rental"
2,ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"good ending, but....My beef with this wasnt that fact it wasnt a horror movie, just the fact it was to sllllllllooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwww. Bring a pillow, this S U C K S!"
4,The Bottom Line,"Yes, by now we realize that The Village shares the same twist as a certain Twilight Zone Episode, but look past that and this is a really great film. The problem is that by now when we watch a film by M. Night we scan the movie to see if we can figure out the plot twists, which only ends up ruining the experience altogether. Watch this movie without such a critical eye and with more of an open mind and I promise you'll really enjoy it. Did I have it figured out before the end? I thought so and turned out to be right, but I still couldn't wait to see if I indeed had figured it out. Any movie which can freak you out with a scene in complete daylight is worth a watch in my book."
2,Don't expect scary....,"If someone had told me before I watched The Village that it was not a scary movie, it would have been a better experience for me, but the trailor advertised it as being this incredibly scary movie and it wasn't. The story, though slow-moving, is a good one.I don't want to give away any of the plot to ruin it for people, but I just want to warn people to watch it for the story and not for the scariness."
2,Weak story + Bad Acting = A Really Bad Movie,"From the promo campaign I really wanted to see this movie. I finally saw it on DVD and boy was I disappointed. The story of the film is shockingly weak and the suspense of the film is quickly replaced with a really stupid story of a blind girl wandering in the woods charged with saving her love. This is a film that could have been great with more work on the script. M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directs this film and it seems to me he needed someone to tell him the script was more like a half hour episode of the twilight zone that a full length film. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid. Save your money and see something more worthwhile."
2,Disappointing.....,"I, like most people, loved this director's previous work. ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" are two of the best thrillers of the last five years *arguably only outranked by ""The Ring""* and I expected this to be just as good if not better. Sadly I was wrong.The trailer is very misleading, however genius. By viewing the trailer alone, this movie looked fantastically creepy and horrifying....this little 19th century village isolated and surrounded by woods where something lurks....Unfortunately, the movie takes a different twist and ruins it. Don't get me wrong...I never saw the twist coming and it was definitely interesting, I was just expecting a diffrent kind of movie....the one portrayed in the trailer would've been one heck of a thriller."
1,just plain disappointed,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Shyamalan's previous movies, especially Unbreakable. But, I honestly don't know how anyone that has seen this movie can give it anything more than two stars!The pace was extremely slow. The story was obvious and very predictable. The dialogue was painful to hear.This movie is neither worth the time nor the money. Wait for it to come on cable and you'll thank me for it.I have to end by saying that I was extremely disappointed."
1,Get me a barf bag,"This is the dumbest, worst, most conniving, suckiest movie of all time.Presumably circa 1700's, a bunch of numbnuts live in a village where they are kept in line by a fear of monsters that surround their village. Their motto is essentially ""be good and the monsters won't bother you"". As it turns out, the village is really run by a bunch of religous zealots, the movie takes place in modern times and the village was just a little west of a strip shopping center.I can't believe there was money to be made off of this. How did they get the green light for this? This flick makes any Ed Wood film seem mesmerizing."
1,"ugh, what a stinker!","This movie REEKED! To call it slow would be kind - it was turgid, pretentious, but without the ooomph to back up those pretentions. Lots of lingering middle shots; horrid faux 19th century dialogue; bad acting; and with a twist a 10 year could've spotted 5 minutes into the movie. Shyamalan's movies seem to get progressively worse, for some strange reason. I hope he's hit the bottom of the trough with this almost unwatchable turkey."
3,I DONT KNOW WHY . . .,"I HAVE READ MANY REVIEWS WRITTEN ABOUT THIS MOVIE AND I MUST SAY THAT MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE, I BELIEVE, ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH BEING SCARED AND SENSELESS VIOLENCE THAN ACTUALLY REALIZING THAT THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY HAD A GOOD STORY AND A MARVELOUS PLOT TWIST. STOP CONCENTRATING ON THE COSMETICS (BLOOD, VIOLENCE, MONSTERS, DEATH) OF THE MOVIE, AND INSTEAD REALIZE THAT IS HAS A POINT AND A MEANING. WATCH THE MOVIE FOR WHAT IT IS AND HOW IT WAS DIRECTED, NOT FOR WHAT YOU WANT IT TO BE !!!"
2,Kudos for trying...,"But in my opinion you failed . M, buddy, you had such a good premise, and fifty minutes in, I was going to my friends, this kicks ::Tail::, and then, Boom, a major char. Gets offed. It was like X-men 2 all over again. But it,(all of the charm of the movie) was all gone. I am going to give you a couple of stars for those first 50 minutes, those were excellent. Bryce Dallas Howard saved the movie from being a total disappointment. The twist was one we had figured out in 15 minutes. I don't mean to be hurtful, but I like to be scared half-way out of my skull(Reason I loved Sixth Sense and Signs. You really scored points from me when you made unbreakable, mainly because I am a comic book feind)And with a heavy heart I must say, Sorry, but until you make another movie that has the goods I won't see this one again.Breakdown:Story: 2 1/2Scenery:5Charachters:3Music: 4Sound:4Ending:1Creatures:2"
3,"Excellent idea, slow in the telling.","This movie was one of the slowest moving films I've ever seen, and the slow pace ultimately brings the viewer to a surprise twist ending but by that point you're so glad the movie is over you could care less about the premise. Boring characters, except the lead girl, she was the only saving grace in the film, and the only convincing character. That's my opinion. Not a horrible movie, but certainly not what it was hyped to be in the previews and commercials. It's not what you might expect. Certainly not the chiller that is promised in the advertisements."
2,Blind you say?,"I guess that they really went all out on a nationwide talent search and cast Mega Director Ron ""Opie"" Howards daughter as the female lead in this mild shocker. No wonder Hollywood is going down the tubes. Don't get me wrong she was good in the part and a little overacting never hurt anyone. But how blind was she? And her father was willing to sacrifice her because of his own guilt over the little boy dying without any medicine in the village? I guess the elders didn't quite think it through. Why wouldn't you have a Doctor in the village? If they wanted to build a ""utopia"" and get out of the big bad city they should have thought it through better. What I want to know is do they pay taxes? Because if the rest of us have to deal with ""Real"" life and have the taxman up our butts why shouldn't they? This movie wasen't scary it was annoying, rich yuppies wanting the GOOD life without dealing with the bad stuff. So true to life."
1,Disapointment,"I have never seen a more boring movie ever in my life! I'm a fair person, so when the movie started out slow I thought ""well a lot of movies start slow so I'll wait till it picks up"" So I waited, waited, waited and waited...It never got any better. The plot was boring, acting mediocre and did I mention boring? Throughout the whole movie I was waiting for SOMETHING to happen but it never did. I found that looking at the back of someones head more entertaining than the movie. Then I finally did something I should have done sooner: I got up and left!!!"
2,Disappointed,"This film has some interesting ideas of the nature of Fear as tool to control using an isolationist Amish style community as its setting.However it was spoilt; by yet another cameo appearance by the Director and his rather formularized 'surprises' which now are his trademark.It would work if your Hitchcock,but he aint !!!!."
3,The Village.,"Not the worst, certainly not the best. The concept is excellent; it just took a long way to get there. Too many time consuming scenes that do not contribute a whole lot to the main plot. Like others who reviewed this, I didn't expect much due to word of mouth. I was more impressed than I thought I'd be. M. Night Shyamalan is still my second favorite writer and can still deliver."
2,What was M. Night Shymalan thinking,"What. That was my reaction when I someone told me the ending. (...) Isn't the movie supposed to be about monsters, not people in costumes. The reason their in costumes is to scare people into staying in their community. I've only seen ten minutes of the beginning and already I hate it. Definitly a big dissapointment."
1,I bailed after 30 minutes.,"After 30 minutes, nothing of note had happened, I didn't know who anyone was and I didn't care. Nothing anyone said made any sense to me. It was boring and awful. Thank goodness it was a DVD so I could just pop it out and put in a DVD of ""Leave It To Beaver"" episodes (really!) which was SO MUCH better!"
4,"I ""Liked"" It....... I Didn't ""Love"" It.","I ""liked"" the movie (as opposed to ""loved"" the movie). It's a bit slow (but that was OK with me) and not the ""thriller"" as advertised. It's more a love story with chilling moments. The twists in the plot were good but might be predictable to the viewer (although I didn't catch on until the movie was almost over). The director (M. Night Shyamalan) is known for these plot twists. He also did the ""Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"" and ""Unbreakable"". I own these other movies and I thought ""The Village"" was his best effort of the ones I haves mentioned. Rent it, don't buy it unless your a fan of the director's movies."
3,It's not lame. It's just average.,"One of M. Night Shyamalan's weakest films. The Village is one of those movies that you just have to rent. Most of the jump scenes are average, the music is unlikable, the acting is stiff, and the twist ending isn't very shocking. The eerie atmosphere throughout the film is effective, however. Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody give very good performances. The look of the film is stellar, and the costumes and sets are fairly decent. All in all, it's just an average horror film. I wouldn't recommend The Village for the jump scares, but I would recommend it for its quiet creepy atmosphere.Grade: 5.8/10"
3,Silly lies...,"M. Night Shymalan, one to make similar movies about different topics, now covers a dys-utopic village society.Everything is going well in the ""19th centuryish"" town. ""They"" live on their side, and the villagers live their lives on the inside, grateful for what they have been given.Yet life is never that simple, for the creatures start crossing borders, and inner romantic struggles shake the village to its foundation.The acting was ok, and the story was decent. I'd say it's too Giver-like, but that's also it's main redeeming quality. This is not a standout by any means (for M. Night, or in general), as it is too long by about an hour!In addition, the trailers were too misleading; they attracted the wrong audience, and dispersed those who would really like it. So you can give ""The Village"" a chance, but alas to say only a mediocre film waits."
1,I love M. Night. This movie sucks badly.,"Oh no! Oh no! I loved The Sixth Sense. I loved Unbreakable. I loved Signs. The Village is wretched. I GUESSED the end by the middle and that's bad in a regular movie - it is UNACCEPTABLE in an M. Night movie. Here are things I said all the way through:Are you kidding me?Please don't let that be the ending.That is the worst, quick wrap up in movie history.Um positive things: You get to look at the super hot Phoenix brother. Bryce Dallas Howard gives a great performance. It really isn't the directing or the performances - it's that it is a stupid movie.But I know you're not going to trust me. You're going to think about how many idiots didn't like Unbreakable and you loved it. How many folks that don't like Signs and you loved it. So you're going to have to see this train wreck for yourself - I understand. I wouldn't have believed me either. Just one thing - do yourself a favor and rent this movie first. You will not want to keep it."
2,2 stars...only because Brody is in it!!,"If this movie moved any slower, it would have stopped! By far M's slowest, and that's saying alot. The some of the characters were well developed, but some of the performances seemed phoned-in. Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody both have done better. The huge ""Plot twist"", and there were 2 this time, were both letdowns and seen well in advance. Pacing is crucial for suspense, but this bordered on ridiculous! Don't watch this movie if you are sleepy, you'll fall asleep. See this only if you're a die hard fan."
4,Superior EDTV performance rivals HDTV!,"Update, I now have bought this EDTV. I have been agonizing-plasma shopping for over half a year, it boiled down to the affordable edtv models, this zenith and the panasonic TH42PWD7UY. For the time being, I rest easy because I am confident this is the best value for an (EDTV) plasma on the market. So many pro's to this TV. I first saw it in Good Guys and Best Buy, next to other HDTV monitors, it still stood out against many others on the same component video feed. The HDTV Discovery signal looked really good. Not only does this Monitor have a built in TV Tuner, but inputs for virtually every video feed you can feed it, decent speakers, slim profile, included stand, and best of all, great picture! 5000:1 contrast?! Faroudja chip in it? These are features embedded into higher priced hdtv models. Very happy with the TV so far, Looking forward to the new HDTV satellite service to be hooked up!"
5,Cutest story for dog lovers,I just love this book. The author writes a sweet and simple story told from Sally's point of view but what really captures you are the beautiful illustrations. Stephen Huneck's work is sold at gallerys across the country and many of the pieces that he sells are images from the books. I think that they are wood carvings/ cutting? Excuse my ignorance. We also have Sally goes to the farm. Both are lighthearted and fun. They really make us all smile. For anyone with a lab in their life this is a must have!
2,eeewww,"I jus rented this game seeing the reviews were ok but i highy regret wasting 6 bucks at blockbuster. This game isnt even ok. Its horrible. the graphics suck, theres not alot of choices to make out of vehicles and u think ure goin 10 miles an hour WHEN YOUR REALLY GOING 70!! WUTS UP WITH THAT!?!?!?! This games is a waste of time. The only reason i give it 2 stars is because one the girls on the loading screen are hot and two they explained the parts correctly but thats it. Everything else is C-R-A-P."
3,An ok product,"* I'm still going to stick with the Matrix Sleek products, they work so much better for my hair* Normal to dry, med-thick, med length hair* So an ok buy to me"
1,Listen to the warnings...,"I purchased this product because after years of heat damage, my hair needed some serious help, and apparently this stuff works wonders. I ordered the largest bottle because of how great it's supposed to be. The product I received literally looks like cottage cheese in a bottle, it's gross. It made my hair feel dry and sticky. Pretty sure this is a scam so beware if you're thinking of getting it off Amazon."
2,Ineresting Ending,This book ends with Evelyn standing on the porch with her special needs brother and a storm is approaching. What's that all about? Not worth the read...Very disappointed..
4,Brought back memories,"Very heartfelt book,going through up and downs,loves and losses. You get very attached to each character in the book. Could not put it down."
4,Great Story,Easy reading and a great story with real life characters. Highly recommend! cannot wait to read another of Moriarty's books.
5,wow . . . . . .,"i was going through my reading block . . . i could NOT get into anything. lo and behold, The Center of Everything is sitting on the coffee table. Anyways, i picked it up and mom basically ordered me to read it because she had heard really really good reviews and Oprah had just read it . . . . . . .i've read this book maybe 4 times? 5, 6, 7 times?it is moving, human, and beautifully written. i sighed when i got to the last page because i could relate and not only that . . . . it was over!this is a book of to be reckoned with,a book that shows all sides of life.what we see is not always what we get. and maybe things are not as black and white as they seem."
4,Great Ending. (But I won't tell.),"Gritty and real. Coming of age is hard, Evelyn knows how to do it, even while under the black cloud that follows almost everyone else around her.Good story. Moriarty is a good story teller."
2,De. Press. Ing.,"I hate to give negative reviews -- in fact, I really try not to -- but this book is exactly what my title says. It's depressing -- unless, of course, you enjoy stories about car crashes, teen pregnancy, and athesim.This book really made me sad, not because it's badly written (infact, its written very well!), but because I found myself relating to Evelyn on the ""i'm not pretty but my best friend is"" level. In high school I was the pretty girl and my best friend wasn't, and reading this novel just brought back those sad, sad memories of her hating me or arguing with me for something that I couldn't help.And you know how everyone treats an attractive girl -- people will say that she's more than likely going to be pregnant by the end of the year. But that's idoicy. Not every attractive girl will get pregnant and not every ""unattractive"" girl won't.Ah, high school, how I hated it.If you hated high school too, I don't recognmend this book."
5,Perfect,"It is strong, and sturdy, and beautiful. Perfect match to my devonshire accessories though out my master bathroom, good buy"
3,"Good story, too much brogue","I agree with another reviewer, the Scottish brogue made this book too hard to read. I don't want to have to try to decipher what the characters are saying. Too much work on my part. This was a negative for me.The story was good enough but bogged down in the middle. The characters were the best part of the story. I Liked Liam and thought Keira was a good match for him.This was my first book by Howell. Someone had left it at a bach condo where we were staying this summer. I pikced it up to read it since I had never read anything by her. I don't I'll read another."
5,Love Holwell books!,"Always enjoy reading Holwell""s books. I enjoy the strong women charcters and the men who can accept them as they are."
5,Awesome album!,"Man, I love tiger army. I have seen them live 3 times and they are awesome every time. This is the self titled first album. When I play tigert army for other people for the first time, I show them a mix between this album and their 3rd album. My only complaint is it is too short! When its over I want more... thats ok though, this is one of those rare good albums that when it is over you simply let it play again."
1,Poor production quality detracts from enjoyment in the story,"Grammatical and punctuation errors are so frequent in this book that they make the story confusing. I found myself forgetting about the plot in a game of ""Find the Next Mistake."" Punctuation errors, especially in the placement of quotation marks, made it difficult to understand when the characters had finished speaking or when someone new was speaking. It's difficult to lose yourself in a story when the publisher keeps showing up on the pages."
1,Glad I wasn't the only one that hated this book.,Don't waste your time. I didn't. After the first 100 pages I kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't. I find myself really wondering if the publisher didn't make a big mistake on this one.
4,Enjoyed This Book,"I have to say that I really enjoyed reading this book. I read over some of the reviews that Fern Michaels got on this book, but I don't tend to agree with some of them. I really liked reading about how Dallas went about changing his life and then managed to finally get back with his love (Sara). Very good book. When I read a book and it makes me cry (as this one did), I have to give it good marks :). I enjoyed this book very much and will reccommend it to my friends."
4,NIce Portable DVD bag,This bag is very roomie except for getting DVDs in and out. Outwise this bag can't be beat.
5,Bright and bubbly like a wine cooler,"Even better than Volume One - ""Spring"". Vintage Chill ""Summer"" is very breezy and upbeat. Chill music with a decidedly Latin feel to it. Recommended for everyone who enjoys listening to music while at the beach or relaxing in a hammock in the backyard. Best tracks - ""At the Beach"", ""Summer Fun"", and ""Roadster"". Also enjoyed the Theivery Corporation song ""Liberation Front"", it is a good change of pace. Can't wait to hear Vintage Chill Fall."
4,Going fast and trimming brass!,The Lyman case trimmer with pilots has been one of the best reloading tools I've purchased. Everything works smooth and leaves a good finished edge to reload.
3,calif law,Calif law requires one detector on each level of your homeI purchased for use in my home of 50 years to complyHave had one first alert before and it was satisfactory.
4,I am safe now,"I bought this to be sure my wood stove insert wasn't trying to end my life. It does the job, I put in the wood stove when it was smoldering and it went off without a problem. Gave me a little peace of mind that it actually works.The beep is loud enough to wake up me, about the loudness of your standard fire detector.Good product, Good price will buy more when I get a natural gas furnace installed."
3,Bought as a replacement,"My old First Alert CO2 monitor had been there for 6 years. 6 years and I never touched it. Then once it started to whine about a new battery, I put in a new one, and that's when it started to flip out. It whinned and made noise - it wasn't because of CO2 in the air - it was just being a baby. It was flashing that it had an error or defect. I never touched the thing I can't imagine how it becomes ""Defective"" just sitting there. Anyhow I bought this one as a replacement.What stinks is that my old one had this plastic bracket bolted to the wall. I was hoping the new one would use the same bracket, but it didn't. I had to unscrew that bracket from the wall, and re-drill two new holes for the screws that this thing latches onto. Kind of a pain.This uses 2 AA batteries, which is good because NO ONE has 9 Volts in their house anymore. That's about the only positive thing. I just have it there because fire codes dictate that one is there. Also it's cheap.So, I guess it's fine!?!?"
1,Extremely short service life,"Now required by law in private residence. Bought this, installed it on the wall pressed the test button and it broke. Called 1stAlert & they are sending me another.--Update--Two weeks and nothing from 1stAlert--Update--90 minutes after posting the last update, the door bell rang, FedX dropped off the replacement.I installed it and it seems to work."
2,"""Nice Voice- Awful Songs""","Easy to understand why she only had a couple hits, the songs here are awful, only 2 good ones worth listening to more than once.Downloaded the CD but after listening to all of it regret it as a waste of money. Unfortunate for now I'll never buy anything else by her."
2,Mediocre,"This is not one of the best books I have ever read. It does a sub-par job of explaining christianity, Islam and Judaism. The style of reading is rather plain and can get very dry and drag on at times. I would say this is a mediocre book and that is about it."
1,"With a title like that, what can you expect ?","A Z-movie sooooo bad it winds up being funny in a roundabout sort of way. The plot, what there is of it, is yet another rip-off of ""The Most Dangerous Game"", which in any of its incarnations was never much to begin with. ""Slave Girls""'s sole redeeming quality is its trio of female leads, in their skimpy costumes (and occasional birthday suits), specially Elizabeth Cayton/Kaitan, who somehow manages to make it through with tongue firmly planted in cheek (it's a wonder she didn't bite it off). If you're into this kind of stuff, you'll laugh your head off. Otherwise ..."
5,Outstanding Denominator,"I bought this after I heard ""Uptown on a Saturday Night"". I have become a fan after one album. Treat yourself to the funky, smooth sax of Mike Phillips."
3,The Final Frontier - Someday Reality May Come,I love everything Star Trek. I am a prime customer for Star Trek on DVD. However when all other TV shows sell for $20 to $50 on DVD the wonderful Star Trek people want over $100 each for their DVD's. Even this so called ultimate deal is still $90 per season when you drop out the movies we all have already.Why do they do this to us who love Star Trek? The new price should be $1000 to $1400 for this set. When they get real I will own this set.
3,Uneven then again informative and entertaining,"I had read 'Ghost Soldiers' , the book recently published about this true life account of a US Army Ranger unit POW rescue in the Philippines during the last year of WWII. I had hoped that the movie would (as the book had done) accurately portray the taut drama and daring of the actual events. Unfortunately the movie suffers in that the potential for momentum drags far too long, bogged down in stilted dialogue with awkward character and plot ""preparation"".Eventually the strike force rescue scenes ensue and the movie for the most part redeems itself as a tense and dramatic portrayal of a little known event in the ""re-taking"" of the Philippines from Japanese occupation. I'm not sure you need to own this one in your collection...maybe just rent or borrow it. This is not in the genre of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers""...not at all!"
2,"WATCH ""SAVING PRIVATE RYAN ""INSTED THIS JUNK!","This movie was real lame. Thought going to get ""director cut"" would be more details and gory ...about 10 minutes of ""Saving private Ryan"" would worth whole entire of this junk.. This is about ""American soldiers"" back in 1945, wasn't this much like now had interracial people. About %90 of cast is ""LATINOS"" back then wasn't like this and BENJAMIN BRATT was soo wrong in this movie too..Movie is trash, and wasting time & money looks like someone from Mexico made this movie. And one of the partners with Benjamin bratt in this movie had Mexican accent, while he was trying to speak English!He had a bit philipino eyes and looks,like some mexicans has that look! just Bad casting and scrip! Skip this,B.S try watch saving private Ryan again that's a real movie and worth every time and money. SKIP this junk! C"
1,Exagerated,"Maybe japaneses (generation of my grand grand father) were too cruel to keep live few hundreds of americans in camps but not to kill many hundred thousands of womens and children at Nagasaki or Hiroshima, in Viet-Nam and recentry in Irac. This movie may provocate antipathies among races by exagerated director's creation but it gave no chance of peace to our world. It's very regrettable the existance of this kind of movies to only earn the money. Leonardo Caprio."
4,Good Film,"I'm not sure exactly why but it seems like I've been watching a lot of military movies of late, and this is among the better ones I've seen. The Great Raid moves a little slowly before it finds itself, but this rescue is a story that cried out for a telling on the big screen. The depiction of the US Army Rangers' raid on a Japanese death camp is among the greatest sequences in modern war films, and represented the saving of human life that is every bit as noble and brave in its own fashion as the deeds of Oscar Schindler as portrayed in Schindler's List. Also the DVD extras on The Great Raid are actually worth watching, especially the interviews with Death March survivors, and also the footage of the actors going through boot camp courtesy of Dale Dye. To anyone who might say, ""this movie made the Japanese look like savages"" I'd point out that it is meticulously based on real life events. I'm glad nothing was sugar-coated for politically correct purposes."
1,Unviewable,Ok if the area code was on there at order time i would not have purchased it. Please show area codes upon selection AMAZON. A B OR C PLEASE. CANNOT WATCH IT.
4,The Great Raid,"I had just finished ""Ghost Soldiers"" by Hampton Sides, one of the books on which the movie was based. I was so engrossed by the story that I stayed up all night reading. . I had not heard of the movie and found it by accident while channel surfing. I will watch it again.I only had one complaint - there was no romance in the book and putting that in is the reason I only gave it 4 stars. If anything it detracted from the story.I especially enjoyed the vintage newsreels at the end."
5,"Good depiction, without the gore","Ghost Soldiers is so well written, that I couldn't wait to see this movie. It very well reveals the horrors of war, without resorting to gushing blood or close-ups of missing body parts. As such, I could watch this movie, while I couldn't watch Saving Private Ryan. The combat scenes were very realistic, and the surround sound at the theater made it feel as if we were in the middle of them.I'm not sure that I would have followed the movie so well had I not read the book. There is so much background information that just can't be covered in so short a time. I think the movie did a wonderful job of portraying the bravery of the Filipinos, as well of the soldiers of one of the first Ranger units."
2,Included on the Complete Season set!,"In a very unclear and probably intentionally confusing marketing move, this and all of the other ""2-hour TV special"" Little House DVDs being released separated are actually included on the Complete Season box sets being released by the same company. I purchased three of these ""specials"" before realizing that they were all 2-part episodes to be found on the complete season sets. This one, for example, can be found on the Complete Third Season, which is now available. While I don't have a problem with these 2-part shows being released separately, I don't understand the need for it and I really, really wish that it would be made clear somewhere on the packaging. Considering that these single disc releases have no special features, this is the worst example of DVD ""double dipping"" I've seen in a long time!!"

3,Did go over well,The vendor was great. Item got here on time. Not a good tasting item though. But I'm sure there are many will like the tsste.
5,Palm Leather Case,"I recently bought this leather case for my Palm TX and it fits beautifully! I like the fact that it has easy access to the buttons as well as the stylus pen and I can still hear any audio through the case. I only use the ""pockets"" to hold my extra sd cards and so far I have not had any problems with the cards possibly touching the screen when the case is closed. I think this is a great case for the price and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a stylish case for their Palm TX!"
2,well...,"it does a good job of keeping the palm organized but, it stinks to high heaven. i mean that literally, it has a reek to it and I cannot get out and the reek is just as strong today as it was 2 years ago when i bought it"
2,Look elsewhere,"Although well-assembled and good-looking, I cannot seem to get my Palm TX to fit in this case. No matter what I try, the top of the screen is always covered, and I end up taking the unit out each time I want to use it, which is (of course) what I wanted to avoid. I would look elsewhere for another case."
1,Dropped Calls are Commonplace,"This phone, and Verizon as a whole, drops calls at a pace that totally surprises me. I got the phone about 6 months ago and it was pretty good....then the calls started dropping.These days i use the phone as an answering machine to prompt me to call on a land line. Unfortunately, I signed a hefty contract so I am stuck with Verizon and this crappy phone for the next two years.Look for a phone that is more reliable, and maybe even sytlish - something this phone and verizon as a whole fails at."
1,Display goes bad,"I got in on the ""Get 3 phones for the price of 1"" deal with Verizon. With this deal, I got (3) of the VX4500 phones. Shortly after I received the phones, the display on one of the phones died. Everything else on the phone worked, but the display was dark (almost like an EnergySaver mode). Needless to say, a cell phone without a readable display is not worth a whole lot. Fortunately, I was within the 30-days, so I got a replacement from Verizon. Now, I've been with the plan for almost a year and another one of the phones is now doing the same thing. This tells me that I didn't get a ""bad apple"" at the beginning, but yet the LG VX4500 is just not a good phone. Unfortunately, I don't have any warranty to fall back on this time. The next time around, I won't be buying anything that has an LG on it."
1,Three awful LG 4500s in a row,These are the worst phones ever! The first two went dead at random times and wouldn't come back on till they felt like it. The latest one just keeps going on and off and playing its cheerful little welcome chimes over and over and OVER. I now have to 1) take the battery out to sleep and 2) go get yet another one tomorrow (don't qualify for a good phone till 2006)
2,Now on my 4th one in 2 years.,"The first one had the screen problem at 4 months - Verizon replaced it. The second one just lost its speakerphone just over a year later so I have to have it on Manner Mode to feel it ring. Unfortunately, I've purchased all of the accessories for it so I don't want to have to buy all of that again so I'm stuck with it through the end of my contract. I just have to pay the $50 field replacement fee for another refurbed. The Verizon tech suggested I check out the Motorola E815 when my contract ends.I brought the 3rd one home, took it out of my purse and looked at the screen and it said ""Battery Charging"" but it wasn't plugged into anything! I did the off/on battery out, back in thing to reset it and it worked for a while then the ""Battery Charging"" indicator came back on. I called Verizon in the morning and we did the off/on battery out, back in thing again and it didn't go away. It went back that day and was replaced AGAIN.LG stuff is just junk. AVOID!!"
1,Sould Quality,The 'sound' quality of this DVD is very poor ! !I have to turn the volume control on my TV as high as it will go and there are still sections in which I can not hear or distinguish what is being said.
1,Half-empty cans and greasy inconsistent ingredients,"We have been feeding this to our dogs for over a year. Over the past few months, we have had a problem with the cases of Grammy's Pot Pie cans. Some cans were full of chunks of fat and a thick lard-like gravy with no veggies, and some cases were fine with chicken and veggies,etc. What happened to truth in labeling? We also had the problem with the cans being only half-full sometimes. Our dogs were getting bad diarhea from the fat in the food so we had to stop giving them Merrick.They need to start testing their food again. It used to be great. Look at the old reviews from last year and before."
1,Sad state of black books,"I wish I could do negative stars. Zora, James, Langston are spinning in their graves. And I bet the younger generation thinks this is great? Even if this garbage is tongue in cheek, I'd rather my kids (17 and 22) play video games or read Sports magazines all day than this mess."
3,"Not bad, quick read","I'm a new Koontz fan - after Odd Thomas I became hooked. This is only the 3rd Koontz book I've read (I have two more waiting for me on the bookshelf as I type) - but I only thought this book was okay. I picked it up a the library and planned on reading it in one day (which I did).It's definitely a quick read, but like the others have said...the ending leaves much more to be desired.I'd recommend it if you're looking for a quick book to read, but be prepared to use your imagination to figure out the ending."
3,"okay, but not is best.","good, but not his best work. One of my very favorite writers, but I think many of his other excellant works have spoiled me."
2,Not that good,"Well, I picked this book up on a rainy day, just mainly looking for something to do. I was very disappointed by what I found. Characters could go from having no beleif in clairvoyance, poltergeists, etc, to preaching these subjects on the next page. He wrote the characters far too predictably, and allowed them too many ""hunches"""
2,What happened to Mr. Dean Koontz,"I am really dissapointed by this book. Sadly, I must say that I read through it as quickly as I could and did not find it too interresting. The story as it is could make a good book. This time, however, Koontz probablt had a week to write it or someting because not only is this book predictable but it also has no closure. He can do better. I hope he will with all his other books."
3,Good....but could have been better.,"I did enjoy THE MASK alot, this was a good eerie novel dealing with reincarnation, it seemed obvious in the beginning, but like any Koontz novel the obvious lies within the unobvious, and when we are finally allowed to look outside the box, we are shown a bigger picture than originally thought. I did enjoy the supernatural element, but The Mask did have a few flaws that kept it from greatness: One being, that Koontz, never really explains the supernatural element that was tipping off the main charactors; were the spirits good or bad? Also, the book ended too abruptly,It was wrapped up in 10 pages. We never know the fate of the charactors, did they live happily ever after? But over all I'll try to stay positive and The Mask is a good early novel for Koontz."
3,Not his best work,"The Mask has a great plot- a girl with no history, no memory...what's behind her eyes? What's in her mind? However, Koontz got a little carried away & I don't think he quite pulled off this story.If you're looking for a great story by Koontz I'd recommend: The Bad Place, Key to Midnight, Whispers & Cold Fire."
5,Real flute sound,"I think it's a good interpretation.And Good sound of flute. Real sound of human breath, I think.It matches with Piazzolla."
1,below average,"This book is not that great if you are taking a Postal Clerk/Carrier exam. I just took this exam on July 8, 2000. Sections # 1 (comparing addresses) and # 2 (memorizing addresses in boxes) are relatively all right. However, Bauptista offers virtually no preparation for section # 3 (numbers) and none for section # 4 (following directions). If that is the test you are taking (Clerk/Carrier) I strongly recommend Norman Hall's book. Some things Bautista says are plain strange. Quoting from the book :""When Bautista talks, people listen"". What is to listen to? :O)"
1,Just not that good,"I just took my US Postal exam yesterday and I have to say that even though I felt very confident when I was done, it was in no part due to this book. Veltisezar's techniques were just common sense and did not require 400 pages and any of my money. His memorization technique was really not that great. In the middle of the test after realizing his technique was just not working I devised my own and did great. And like already stated he did not offer much help at all on the last 2 sections. If I had the time I would write a much better book than this to help people... Or at least after I know I have a USPS job. Take my advice and stay away from this book. I don't have experience with any others, but I am sure this is not the best one."
4,Many different feelings,"I am ten-years-old and I loved reading ""The Wish!"" I have not read Ella Enchanted, but I know that it has GREAT reviews. This book gave me a real idea and meaning about how friendship works, especially when her friends were deciding if they should be her friend. ""The Wish"" showed some real meaning about friendship, and why they should be some one's friend or not. I do recommend this book to any one thatlikes a lot of things going on. This book is exciting, sad,romantic, and many other feelings. This book I recommend this book to many girls who like this author. My favorite character in this book was Ardis. She was caring and popular only for a good reason. She was popular because she is nice to every one. She is VERY tall! I enjoyed reading about her and every one else. Even though Ardis wasn't the main character, she was my favorite. I think that if you read this, you will like her to!"
3,Not really sure,"I never finished this book because, well, it just didn't keep my interest. I love Gail Carson Levine as an author, but I don't think this was her best book. I wasn't bad or anything, just kind of,well... boring."
3,"The Wish, a good book to read",I find it pointless to write a reveiw telling the plot of a book. I read this book last year in a program called Girlstalk. I found it intreaguing. I thought that the main character was interesting. I could relate to her but only in some ways. This was not my favorite book by Gail Carson Levine. It was still a very good book though.
3,Wilma's Wish,"This is not a bad book,but not the best either.Wilma is a girl who is teased at school,then meets some kind of magical old weird woman on a train,who promises to make her into a ""cool cat"".Guess what?The wish comes true.Wilma is suddenly the most popular girl at school."
5,I wish to read The Wish!!,"The Wish was very funny. It was very exciting and was packed with action. It was a very good book.I think people of all ages will like this book very much. It might not interest teenagers and adults, but I`m eleven and I loved it.The main character, Wilma, is very funny. She seems to love animals a lot. She learns it`s not what`s on the outside, but what` s on the inside that counts. She learns this from Jared, Daphne, and the old lady. The author`s main idea, is to be yourself.If I had to rate The Wish , I would give it 5 stars on a 5 star scale and 2 thumbs up. It`s a rose in a garden of weeds, a TRex in the land of dinos, and a bike in the land of trikes."
3,Decent,"This book was OK. I thought it started out pretty well, and it stayed well untill about the last 1/4 of the book. After that everything got a bit shakey and kind of stupid. I guess its for a younger age group than myself, Im 17. Usually I enjoy books like this but this time i just though it was a little but too, uummm, picture perfect. It to me was just kind of a stilly ending. If you decide to read this book you will see what I mean. I give Gail props for the begining, I think the begining was awsome, it just seemed like she threw together the end. But dont take my oppinion, its a decent book and its work 6 bucks I guess. Give it a try."
3,The description doesn't match the product,"I was hoping in a 2 cd set with this title that there would be more World Music. This music is sort of like ""character"" dance, in that a few of the tracts have some sort of relationship to Middle Eastern Music. The rhythms, at least, are correct and easily identified. Perhaps this would be a good CD for beginners who are trying to lean to analyze Belly Dance Music, but not much is on here that is very inspiring, or relates much to World Music or Dance of any kind. The last tract is clever, the Metaphysical Blues, but it isn't World Music, either!"
3,"Some good ideas, but incomplete.","Contrary to the subtitle, this is not a total-body workout; it doesn't include any of the lower-body exercises (squats, lunges, calf raises) that Stew Smith's or Dennis Chalker's books have.Smith's book also does a much better job of integrating the PT, running and swimming into a total program with a lot of variety in the workouts."
3,"Great for intermediates and advanced, but not for beginners","This book should have another edition. While it is excellent in that it describes all the exercises and shows good progression it fails to do two things for beginners. One, the rest period that should be taken. And two, it needs to go into depth about HOW the exercises should be done. A beginner may hurt him/her self without knowing the proper methods of the PT exercises."
5,WEB Griffin back when he could really write,"Part 2 of the Marine series has Ken McCoy back. The book is a clear winner of top sagas. Not all that much action, but these books are about the big picture of Marines as they were in the long stretches of time between battles. Pickering(s) and Zimmerman remain favorites who have stood the test of time over the decades since I first read this series of books."
2,Flavor Flav!,"The watch is beautiful but it is HUGE, ridiculously HUGE! I could have put a chain on it, wore it around my neck and been Flavor Flav for Halloween! I returned it but got another Invicta that was more normal sized. I knew it was over sized before I bought it but seriously unless you are a 6'8"" defensive tackle or have tree trunks for wrists, this watch probably isn't for you."
3,Pretty Good...,"I bought this album a few months ago because I loved the song Makes No Difference, and I still do, and it might be my favorite Sum 41 song. However, when I listened to all the songs, I thought that there was a lot of filler, with very long instrumentals which are mostly drumming. I mean, Steve is a great drummer, but the solos sometimes go on for a very long time. The hooks are definatly catchy on the songs Summer and Makes No Difference which I already said. There is a mostly hidden track, called What We're All About, which can be found on the soundtrack for Spider-Man. I don't think this is the first Sum 41 cd for a person just getting into them to get, get ""All Killer, No Filler"" first (the song Summer is also on that one).Happy Listening!"
4,Sum 41 kicks,"Sum 41 is much better than... blink 182. besides, ""Makes no Difference was featured at the end of ""Bardock:The Father of Goku"" Dragon Ball Z movie incase you guys didnt know. What movie has Blink been in? tell me that!!"
5,Better than all killer no filler..,"This is THE best SUM 41 cd.Its twice as good as all killer ni filler,despite its short.Machine gun is the best song.Im probably the most devoted and obssesed sum fan they'll ever have so take it from a sum fan and buy the dam cd!!!"
2,"Ehh, not bad but not good",Aesthetically pleasing case. Seems quite rugged for the several months I've owned it. Not an exact fit for the TX (even though this case is supposed to work with TX and T5's per Palm) so it can rattle around inside if you don't take up the room with something. I used the foam cupboard liners. Really needs a cut out or for the seam to be re-aligned on the bottom so you can hook up your data/power connection while the unit is in the case. Otherwise you need to prop the palm upwards to prevent stress on the connection.
1,poor quality,"I bought my first case and had the latch break in less than 1 month (with very little use -- I am very gentle with my pda, and I had heard that this latch was easily broken, so I actually try to close the latch whenever possible!). I could not stand not being able to close the case when the latch broke, and I was silly enough to buy a second case. This latch lasted me 3 months, and snapped off today. I bought the aluminum case for the protection that it offers, but I have never seen a case with its latch be able to last. I think you're ultimately better off with a leather case, because this case is no good for protection once it cannot latch any longer."
1,This case is really BAD!,I have a Tungsten T/X and it rattled while in the case. Plus it was hard to open. Return it and order the Rhinoskin case instead.
2,Good idea--weak implementation,"The hard case is a good idea--it protects the T5 as I carry it in a cargo pocket or toss it in a briefcase. As someone mentioned, it rattles inside the case, and the rattling in the cargo pocket is annoying. Having to flip the T5 back and forth to turn on, plug in, or Hot Sync, is annoying. And the strongest drawback is the weak plastic closure. As someone was afraid it would do, mine has broken already, less than a month after purchase. They were prompt at getting the rebate out. I got my rebate check days before the clasp broke. I'm going to have to find another case. This one still closes, but I don't think I'll get more than one or two more uses out of it."
4,The Turtle Warrior,"To those of us near or beyond a certain age, i.e., 50, the interplay between WW II and the Vietnam conflict (remember, it was never a declared war) certainly plays on our emotions. This book is not an easy read; it is one you need to put down and ponder before reading further. War is fought on many fronts, with each character in this book having lost something in his/her war. I found the narrative format mesmerizing, not like a voiceover where you envision a movie in the making. To those of us who grew up in the rural midwest during this time period, it invokes memories of the simplicity, conflictions, and emotions that we faced, and gives us insight to what our parents were facing at the same time. Please savor this book, especially the last line."
2,Average performance,"I don't understand why people are so excited about this recording. It's one of the worst recordings of Brahms ever recorded. If anybody wants to hear THE best ever recording of Brahms' violin concerto, it's the recording by Heifetz and Toscanini on March 11, 1940. But this... I regret I bought this CD."
3,disappointing,"I bought this solely based on reviews, particularly by a record store that is held in very high record, but who, unfortunately, have steered me wrong before with claims of psychedelic brilliance. Perhaps I need to give this a better listen and another chance, but I'm really not hearing what other folks are. I have the feeling that if it were in English, people wouldn't regard it so highly as it would seem less like some obscure gem. I was actually bored by this; it was not what I was expecting at all. Just goes to show you that you really need to listen first and watch those impulse purchases.I will give credit to the seller though; it arrived lightening fast."
3,Attractive but hard to assemble & missing parts,"I just assembled this buffet. The Middle Panels were mislabeled, and middle panel C was missing the plastic inserts on the 2 outer holes to that the cam lock screw could screw into it. I ended up going to Home Depot and buying wood dowels and putting them in the holes. Hopefully this will be enough to hold the shelf in place.The 3 drawer handles came with screws and handles in a bag. One of the handles had the wrong screws (they were too short). I had to call to get the correct screws. Not an easy piece to assemble, but very attractive once it's all together. It scratches easily as well, so assemble with care."
3,Worth the price,"I purchased this pack to use for my emergency ""go-bag"". I didn't encounter the strong smell that some of the other reviews have complained about, I can barely smell the pack when I hold it to my face, so that is good. The frame construction is very floppy, but the pack is not unnecessarily heavy unlike some other backpacks. The two front zipper pockets should be used for flat objects and do not have a lot of space. The two side pockets are great for holding small objects but not water bottles. The main compartment in the pack is very roomy, but like I said floppy and won't hold it's shape until you fill it up. It fits very well on your back and is mostly supported by the shoulders, and is not excessively large or small. Also being waterproof is great for the price. All in all I'm happy with what I got for the price that I paid."
3,Bang,"Our dog loves this brand and this specific flavor. However e, the cans came badly dented with one partially opened both recent orders. Likely will buy elsewhere going forward"
2,*** Poor Quality ***,This toy was ENTIRELY torn apart by my 17lb cocker spaniel in LESS THAN 10Min. of being played with/chewed on. I had to take it away and throw it out within 15 min. of handing it to my dog. The quality of the product is POOR at best.
5,Part Three of Pipes' Russian Historical Trilogy,"Simply stated: a must read for those who have read Russia Under the Old Regime and Thr Russian Revolution. Pipes continues his survey of Russian history and his explanation of how governments in general work. Prof Pipes is brilliant as usual in all respects, not least of all his understanding of Russian history under communism. This book should be read by anyone studying political movements or by anyone who plans to initiate a political movement!"
4,Primer,"Very well-written primer on China's economic, political and cultural transition in the late twentieth century. It is both instructive and entertaining and was a welcome companion on my recent first trip to China. It loses a star, however, because even though it is the first non-fiction book I have read about modern China, my sense is that a significant portion of what I read is already out-of-date. Still, it is a valuable snapshot of China in the mid-1990s with many enlightening sidebars into China's past."
1,DO A GOOGLE SEARCH FIRST,"Before you buy this book cut/paste the following words into a Google search:""Hank Hanegraaff"" financialThen come back to this review.It makes me weap to see Christian ministries misuse God's money. My advice? If you really MUST read this book, buy it USED so the money goes to a struggling book seller."
5,Excellent book on the plant life cycle,"The life cycle of a plant from seed to seed is beautifully illustrated and told as a story in the rhythmic pattern of the ""House that Jack Built"". Each page has a flap and under each flap is more information about plants, the garden and its other inhabitants. My 3 year old enjoyed the book and the flaps. I'm not crazy about the flaps because I'm afraid he is going to tear them up, but that is my only complaint about the book. The illustrations are detailed and visually interesting. It kept my small childs attention and he would have liked that I left the book with him. An improvement would be to republish the book with all the same information but make it a board book and no flaps."
2,Joan Hart's acting drives me crazy,Melissa Joan Hart should have stuck with being a teenage witch. This was a pile of donkey doo doo. The most annoying thing about the whole movie was she and Britney remaking the song and her prancing around in that waitress outfit. The guy in the movie is UGLY. There is no helping an ugly man. And Melissa needs a makeover herself. I don't know why I am pondering so much over this film because it is literally ridiculous and worthless. Maybe that is why it is entitled Drive Me Crazy!!
4,It's O.K.,"I went to watch this movie just because Britney was singing the theme, and I've watched Sabrina a couple of times, the movie is good when you watch it for the first time, but after that it becames boring for a simple story and a bad chemistry between Hart and Geiner, the reason to see this is for Melissa, that's it."
2,Boring another rewrite of love don't cost a thing,It was boring from beginning to end and then there parents r dating so soon they will step brother & sister. It was stupid and Corney I wouldn't pay 3cents for it.
4,its good,it is a good movie and very intertaining for a teen romance movie its is funny and entertaining to watch
1,arg so bad,"first of all this movie's title had to be changed so it could fit a britney spears song. That just shows how meaningless the movie is to the people who made it. This movie was pretty bad. The plot is weak and the parts of the movie that weren't weak were formualic. There used to be good teen comedies. I guess there are none left. I can sum this review up in one sentence ""I walked out of the theater before it ended"""
4,Adrian Grenier is worth buying this movie,"This is truly one of the best films for teens out there (and grown-ups will enjoy it too.) Adrian Grenier is gorgeous and talented - he's going to be a huge star and does an incredible job regardless of Melissa Joan Hart's one-note, though likeable, acting style. The supporting cast, especially Kris Park, Mark Webber and Susan May Pratt are great. Also some good messages about drunk driving, peer pressure and loyalty. Not as good as Breakfast Club or Sixteen Candles, but definitely best of the current teen flicks out there."
2,Bleached Gospel,"Let's be truthful, the Word is a bunch white boys, (okay they're not all white and color doesn't really matter, BUT ...)trying to sound soulful, but the soul is missing. Robert Randolph is definitely an able player who was brought up in the church and knows how to ""evoke the spirit,"" but if you want to hear the UNDISPUTED MASTERS OF SACRED STEEL, THE CAMPBELL BROTHERS ARE THE REAL DEAL. Just ask the Word band members on this CD, they too will acknowledge that they are neophytes when it comes to church/gospel music. The playing is good, but you can't fake soul and this ain't got much...lots of good notes, but not a lot of passion and soul behind them."
5,As good as live,"I've been lucky enough to see Robert Randolph and family live twice this summer, and they put on an awesome show. The CD will definitely make you want to get up out of your seat, cause there ""Ain't no-booooodddddyyyy"" like Robert and crew!"
5,A Jamfan MUST HAVE,"During a summer when there is no mega tour; when everything seems like a brady bunch rerun you've seen 304 times: Out comes THE WORD. Fresh, innovative and uplifting; FUNKY, soulful and creative... it's all in The Word. Joyful Sounds and Waiting On My Wings have irresistable riffs that tattoo on the brain for days. Blood on That Rock and I'll Fly away are spacey, layered and complex while changing tempo and pitch lay in the hands (and foot) of the Pedal Steel guitar master, Robert Randolph: who hadn't played outside of his church band more than a handful of times before this project. If you have any inclination toward: Phish, String Cheese, Deep Bananna Blackout, Medeski, Martin & Wood, Allman Brothers, BB King, Hendrix, Clapton or straight up GOSPEL BLUES ROCK- You must have THE WORD."
2,Not as good as the ratings say.,"I bought after reading the positive reviews on other sites. I bought it on amazon because of the price. It was cheaper. I read the directions and used the product accordingly.Unfortunately, I cannot say that I felt or saw the difference in my body energy, or waste. I am an herb user and take the time to notice any differences in my body when using new products.So I cannot recommend this product to others. I am only giving it 2 stars because it did not hurt me."
3,2 bad discs,"I gave the Pilot, Season one and season two to my granddaughter and 2 of the discs were messed up. Everything else was great."
5,Timeless classic,This is wholesome family entertainment at its best! Watching this with our kids brings back memories of watching when we were kids. It is unfortunate that a show like this would not be picked up by a network today: it has very little violence; it teaches values; it mentions God and shows prayer in almost every episode. The stories are well written and well acted. Do yourself and your family a favor and get this series!
5,The best family entertainment there is.,"Every season of Little house is awesome, my kids love it just as much as I did when I was little. Each episode has a great lesson and is filled with family morals and values. I will be purchasing every season."
3,Little House review,I was really disappointed when I received my package. A loose dvd was scratched and unlabeled. One of the dvds was missing. I contacted the person and told him the situation. He corrected it right away and refunded my money. So part of the transaction was not good but the seller was very prompt and apologetic about the situation so that was good.
5,Nothing less than excellent!,Crystal clear audio with great range. This is simply the best cordless phone I've ever used. Text screen lights up well when a call comes in and easy to see the caller ID. The handset is much lighter in weight than others I've used and the battery life is excellent! This is the one to buy. You will not be disappointed.
1,Worked well for 10 days !!,Phone looked good and worked well for 10 days. Then it stopped working completely. Currently trying to return it. I would look for an alternative model. Very dissappointed.
5,1 word...WOW!,It don't get much better than this. You just gotta listen to it to see what I'm talking about!
1,bodysuit,I ordered a body suit for a kindle fire hd 8.9 and received one that won't even come close to fitting.
3,At least it was free,"At least I got this free, when I bought the Boxwave Stylus. The back of this Boxwave Bodysuit is too slick to feel confident in gripping this. The fact that it's too slick on the back, I'm always in constant fear that it's going to slip out of my hands. This body suit doesn't feel thick enough that it doesn't make me confident enough that if it slips out of my hands (due to it being so slick on the back) that the bodysuit won't break the fall. I've reverted back to the Marware Genuine Leather Cover in order to be able to grip it, and let it protect the Kindle should I drop it.Since it was free when buying the Boxwave Stylus, it was no loss to me."
3,More about MR. Kennedy,"While the book offers insight on Jackie Kennedy, I felt the author took liberties with assumptions about behavior on the parts of both John and Jackie Kennedy. I feel that motivations asserted by Leaming could not have been backed up with appropriate documentation. The reader also gets bogged down in details of the Cuban Missile Crisis, so I often felt I was reading a history of the presidency rather that documented detail that would illustrate the essence of Jackie Kennedy. I did enjoy the book but found it missed the mark in providing a greatly illustrative book about who Jackie Kennedy really was."
2,"Disappointed, Rude-Awakening, and Yes Suprised","I think that my title about says it all. I was in my teens when JFK was shot. I believed in all of the hype up and into my late adulthood. Now, I am extremely disappointed in finding out in greater detail of JFK's sexual problems. Not happy with Jackie in how she dealt with his sexual problems but given the times in which she lived I guess that this is what she had to do to stay with the man that she loved and father of her children. After about 3/4'a into the book I just about threw it down. The sexual over tones is so much that it is disgusting but I am hard believer in finishing a book once started. The extremely longrepeated parts of the 'Cuba 1' and 'Cuba 2' should have been shortened...we are not dumb we get it. My rating is based on the repeated sentences over and over and in part due to the depressing information that I have experienced in reading this book. The passage of this information is now in the hands of the ages."
2,2.5 stars; buyer beware,"While Barbara Leaming turned out a decent, albeit tabloidesque, book on Jackie here, there is some halfway decent info. on the Secret Service contained herein, courtesy of an agent I spoke to, as did Seymour Hersh: Larry Newman. Good for the collection (and Newman's remarks).Vince PalamaraSecret Service expert, History Channel, author of 2 books, in over 32 other author's books, etc."
5,Excellent,My dog really looks forward to these treats. We have tried other brands that she refuses to eat after a few days. And they work on my lawn too. With a female dog you have to be careful of brown/ yellow splotches on your lawn and these treats help eliminate those unsightly spots.
3,Fussy Pup,"Our little Lhasa Apso has a bit of a dental issue, so we've been trying different products to keep away the yellow spots in our yard. She wasn't wild about these soft chews but we sneak one in once in a while! We're not UNhappy with the product, but it's not quite filling the bill!"
3,Don't buy the wrong version,"I bought the wrong stuff before and returned it.I bought the wrong stuff again, returned it at a cost.Fair enough for Amazon, but it seems to work for our dog and he likes this one. He refused to eat another same brand but different formulation."
2,The Cairo Trilogy: Who Translated it?,"I very much wanted to buy this book, and read the pages available through the ""Look Inside"" section on the Amazon page. (I didn't want to give the book a star rating, but Amazon's system forced this upon me.) I personally would be unable to bear the translator's chosen staccato-like rendering, and wonder if the original version has been effectively ruined. For this reason I am not, with regret, buying the book."
2,Boring....Lack of serious information.,"I enjoyed the testimonials from actual business owners, but that's where the enjoyment stopped.This book was filled with fluff. I had a hard time finding information that was able to be applied to my new business.The majority of the ""great advice"" can be summed up in one statement, ""Hire a professional.""This was the girls' advice on almost every subject.Sure, ""Write a business plan"" is good advice, but I was looking for tips and tricks to make the process easier and more effective for lenders.Readers looking for details and practical tips will be disappointed.Might be good to get you thinking about the very beginning stages of planning."
5,Fantastic,I remember while I was growing up the turmoil that was created during this time. My family tried explaining what was going on. It was a frightening and sad time for us. Denzel played the role to the max. Loved it.
2,did not fit my hairdryer,"this product was pretty much what i was looking for. wasn't crazy about the rubber tips. preferred the old style harder tips. the product was supposed to fit most hairdryers, but of course did not fit my modern hairdryer, so it is of no use for me until i can purchase one it does fit. would have helped if it had listed the hairdryer types it did fit so i didn't waste my money."
5,Win2K Admin's Need Only Apply....,"I found this book to be just what is needed after reading the Microsoft's Resource Kits and Admin Companions. Unlike some authors whom you have to wonder if they only read the white papers and surf Technet and support.microsoft.com to get the info for their books, you can tell the author has actually used the products in a real environment!"
5,Herbs for Healthful Living,"This is a great book, with lots of up-to-date and relevant information. Dr Brinker is of the most knowlegable herbalists in the US and must be heartily thanked for sharing a part of his vast wealth of knowledge. A good reference for the lay person as well as the medical professional."
4,TC's review,"I was a great read and as I when I got to the end it was like the story just stop. I felt as if I was left hanging. I felt left with out any sense of closure. If there is a follow up I would definetly read it, I would love to know how these characters are doing."
1,Just too much Prayer,"I know this sounds like an act of Blasphemy for the church folk, but there was too much prayer in this book. I couldn't finish it. I just got the impression that these characters wasted their life. They couldn't seem to get dressed in the morning without asking God what to wear! At some point I just wanted them to be adults and make a decision! I could see if they meditated on some things but my goodness, it was just a matter of ""Jesus, should I walk now, Jesus, what should I do, Jesus when will I do it"" and for me it ruined the book. All three women fell into a bad category and if they were real I would tell them ""Don't be so heavenly minded, that you are no earthly good!""."
5,The Greatness of Bravo,"Of the four that I own this one has some of the best in it. It is fun, enjoyable and a must see for anyone over the age of eighteen. If you like anime, this is easily one of the best."
3,"Great light scent, doesn't stay",Too bad this truly lovely scent has no staying power. I use it as an after bath spray so I can enjoy it for a few minutes.
4,Fragrance,The package arrived on time and in good shape. The product was acceptable...I have been using this product for about 2 years.
5,lovely,"I received my product extremley fast, there was no damage. The correct charge was place on my credit card.I love ordering from Amazon,they are a company you can trust. Keep up the good work . Thanks"
2,Smells like old lady pefrume,I work at a dept store and I saw this perfume I decided to give it a smell it smells to strong and like it was made in the 80's not like the new fresh scents of today. Not the worst I give that award to Tabu the worst smelling perfume ever but definantly something I wouldn't want.
2,"scent does not last,unbelievable.",Look I cannot complain that the scent is different. I really had preferred the scent to most others I have. That is why I ordered it again. I even have had sarah jessica parkers other scent dawn. BUT this time this perfume's scent does not last. It may last 15 minutes tops. I do not know if it is the manufacturer nor do I have time to figure it out . I just will not order this product again.
1,Hate It,"I have used Lovely for a few years and loved it. This purchase is awful, there is no snell. The packaging and bottle look the same but contents not the same. Its like a knock off of the real thing."
2,Return,I mistakenly ordered the wrong item for my wife's Christmas gift and wanted to return it. Amazon won't let me return it because it is considered flammable. So when ordering be sure your item is not classified as hazardous (perfume?) or you will not be able to return it. There was no mention of this when ordering...so buyer beware!
2,why all the fuss?,"Ok..I bought into all the hype about this fragrance before it even hit the shelves. I bought it sight and smell unseen. Mistake. I love S&TC, love SJP, but DON'T love this musky scent. My former boss even told me to never wear it to work again, as it made her nauseous!"
1,Cheap imitation!,"My wife asked me to buy her this perfume because she used it before and liked it very much. This imitation we bought on Amazone did not even come close. She was very dissapointed, $37.50 wasted!"
5,childhood favorite,"This book has been my favorite since I was a child. The words flow so well when reading to myself or my children. Although there are some grafic parts, they don't take away from the poem/story being youthfull and fun. I will always read and share with others this delightful story."
5,A good book portraying war,"This is a good book that deals with war in Central America. I had to read it as EC for World Geography and was awed by the way it described how children would feel about being part of guerlla forces and war. In the US, kids take for granted that they don't have to even consider such situations, and Moeri's book is a good eye-opener to the world of Central America."
4,"Martin, Vol 2 & 3",Purchased the DVD for my Granddaughter at her request. She just loves the series. Locks herself in her room infront of the DVD Players and laughs unstoppable.
4,Almost Great,"Hochschild is obviously a talented writer, and he does a great job of tackling a very difficult subject. However, often as he was drawing me in, he would throw in an anti-American non-sequitor, like comparing the people in the Gulag to the homeless in America. Huh? I'm not without compassion, but that is comparing one man's cut finger to another man's cut from the guillotine. Hochschild would be well served to leave his alternative agenda out of this book and focus on the subject at hand. The victims of the Gulag deserve nothing less.However, if you can ignore these occasional comments which are out of place and inappropriate, The Unquiet Ghost is a solid effort which worth reading."
4,"Three star book, but Zig makes it worth reading, add a star!","I enjoyed the book by the end. The stories he shares are intresting and come from a man who can sell. I enjoy his books in general. This one is very good the last 60 pages or so. If you want more meat then turn to ""Cars and People How to Put the Two Together"" for automotive sales. Try SPIN selling as well."
5,Instant Classic,"For those interested in the journey of Buddhism's essence, as it spread across China from India, this is an outstanding, comprehensive work.Andy Ferguson brings alive a sparkling, sometimes wild and crazy, cast of characters. The master/student relationship is highlighted, and the chronological order of presentation helps clarify a long story that is often vague in other works."
4,Gift for my mom.,She loved listening to Selena. She also now loves this CD. Word. Word. Word. Word. Word. Word. Word. Word. Word.
4,Great size!,"This barbell is perfect size for me. They originally put a very large barbell in my eyebrow but, I wanted something smaller so I ordered from this website. I am very pleased with my purchase and the color hasn't changed or faded yet."
4,Book is in excellent condition,"The book is in excellent condition, as advertised. It was a gift and he loves it."
5,Review,The book arrived in a timely manner and was in great condition. I would recommend this shipper to others. Thank you
1,One star - barely,"I picked up this book because I am also travelling to Europe as a single woman. Thinking I could get some insight on how to manuever in a foreign environ. Wrong. Talking about affairs of the heart and referring to other authors doesn't do much to inspire me. Or others I would imagine. Talking about places to go, great. Talking about the cat back home, not interesting. Perhaps it was marketed incorrectly. It should be marketed as a diary, not a travelogue."
3,Mid grade,"This writer did not grab me. I enjoyed her story, but did not feel befriended along the way. I listened to the tale and was entertained, but I did not have the anticipation you get from sitting down with a good friend. I preferred Kite Strings of the Southern Cross, Tales of a Female Nomad and Living on an Arc."
1,Anything but independent. Trite and embarrassing drivel.,"Anything but independent. This book was at points embarrassing especially the fling with the Japanese man. Expensive hotels and meeting friends along the way. Not much self discovery or true solo traveling. I found the author self-centered. Why do these women travel writers always find a lover along the way, too. How about truly traveling solo. I think there is an underlying need for a man to make them whole. So many smart independent women travel to off the beaten path locations who could write much better books."
4,Worth reading!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!Alice is a person who anyone would enjoy traveling with,and it was an easy, flowing read.Her personal observations on each new experience,and the people she met were a delight.I highly recommend this one!"
3,With Reservations,"I think the title is odd because Alice Steinbach definitely had reservations about going on the trip and she made most of her overnight reservations before she left.A very pleasant book, but it really isn't about being alone--it's more about the people she met. Which is fine because that's what made the book interesting sometimes. Her dreams, earlier regrets, and postcards to herself are perfect for the nights when it's hard to get to sleep.I enjoyed reading about her romance with the Japanese gentleman. Actually, I've been to Japan many times and was astonished by it. I also loved her story about the young woman she met in Italy who was to be married soon. That was excellent.All-in-all, it's a pleasant and well written read and I felt as though the author could be a friend. Maybe because I'm about the age now that she was when she was on the trip. It might have been a wonderful adventure for her, but for me it was just a sweet travel memoir."
2,Should have read the reviews,"I agree with most of the online reviews....I picked up this book looking for some really interesting characters with wry humor sprinkled about each encounter...instead it is a rather dry book with sparse ""can't put this down"" fascination. Ms. Steinbach could do more if she put down the humorous internal conversations that I know she had while traveling abroad...she just didn't write them down. If you are looking for a good coffee-house book to read DON'T pick this one....pick GOOD IN BED, any of BILL BRYSON'S books....or anything else that you thought you would wait to read!!"
2,Helped me sleep,"I have to admit that I did not get very far in this book before realizing that I had 42 other books on my shelf to read and I had no obligation to finish this rather uninteresting journal. So, my review is only to let you know, as an avid reader, that I put this down after about 50 pages. I finally realized that I just didn't care about the author or her travels. She seemed contradictory at times and confused others. To me, this seemed to bewritten as a personal read for the author herself."
5,there's no maybe about it...,"This is an absolute gotta-have-it for anyone who did not have the good fortune to hear Robert Palmer live in concert in his early years with Island records. The live side captures the pure power, dazzling energy, and unique styling that began generating the love and devotion found in Palmer devotees. The material, arrangements, and musicianship throughout are of the same sterling caliber that became Palmer's mainstay. As always, Robert Palmer set his own hurdles so high that he would have to work hard to outdo himself in any subsequent offering.This is a rare jewel."
4,Fresh_Air,Do not sleep on this gem people. Listened to this about 10 times all the way through and it just keeps getting better and better. Layers of well thought out lyrics paired with solid beats. Lots of solid MC influences here as well. I hope these guys tour the East Coast would love to see them live and show support.
4,Decent cheap mailers,"These padded mailers were the most cost effective I could find at the #000 size. They are well padded and have great stickum to hold the flap closed. The only thing I was unhappy about was the size was a hair smaller then standard #000. The inside ran from 3.75"" - 4"" and the inside length was 7"". It was tight for what I was shipping but it worked. Overall these are nice mailers and when I need more I will buy them here."
5,Perfect size for small crafts/ jewellery,"These are great for what I plan to ship, jewellery and small things nice and cheap with bubble wrap inside the best deal around I looked!"
2,Cheap mailers. Size stated is outside edge to edge.,"The mailers arrived as 25 loose mailers thrown into a large film mailing envelope. The kraft outside paper on the mailer is thin. Keep in mind that the size stated of 4x8 is the outside edge to outside edge, not the inside usable space. The actual useable inside space of the envelope is approx. 3"" x 6.75"" if the item is fairly flat. I would suggest securing all the edges with packing tape on these envelopes. These mailers are not as economical as you may think if you need to tape the edges for those items that are not flat and thin."
5,Down Sunnyside Lane,"I have been searching for this CD for years - trying to replace this from the cassette version. These three CD's are a brilliant collection of 30's hits and jazz classics - It brings back very happy memories from when my grandmother was a singer and I was just a little boy, listening to her sing at parties and for our family too. This is also a brilliant mini series if you can track it down on DVD."
2,review of toy,"the toy was okay. its really hard to use. no child will be able to use this because it requires a lot of force to unload the cartridge. it broke on me the second day when my friend was playing. he shot too fast, and it snapped a nerf thing in half.however, if you're careful and strong enough to use it, i'm pretty sure its tonnes of fun. however, maybe i'm just not right for this.However, the company/person that shipped the toy was really really good. it arrived really soon in perfect condition. the problem i had was with the product and not the seller."
5,Excellent and Realistic Rifle,"This Buzz Bee rifle is really cool and fun to play with! I bought it for my 6 year old grandson and although he has trouble cocking the lever to eject the spent shell and load a new one, I use it instead when we have our dart gun battles. It shoots pretty far too! I like how the spent shells pop out just like a real rifle. I read all the reviews and it is just as advertised. It's also fun to eject the empty cartridge and load a new one. I would recommend purchasing extra cartridges and shells because in the heat of a battle, you need replacements (lol). I highly recommend this dart gun rifle."
3,not enough blast,"I bought this rifle for my son on his birthday. He's got a collection of the various models and was excited to finally get this one. Unfortunately he was dissapointed after he loaded it up and fired off a few darts. The range was pitiful, in some cases between three and five feet. We were going to send it back but my son wasn't willing to give up on it so easily. He substituted some of the lighter darts from one of his other guns and was pleasantly surprised when he was able to shoot over 15 feet. Now it's his favorite.I was really surprised at the poor performance of this particular rifle. Hopefully it was just a bad unit."
3,Doubleshot is better,"It costs the same price, go for the double shot instead, you wont regret it. This one destroys bullets if you aren't careful, and just isn't as much fun."
1,Will Never Arrive. Place your subscription directly through AP Magazine instead!,"Please don't order from Synapse Services, Inc if you ever want to see your subscription. At this rate, the next cover of AP Magazine will have this for a title: ""Newest Band on the Block - The Sex Pistols"". I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my son on December 12th, 2009. Looked on my account and it said first issue would arrive in February. That month came and went. My account then said first issue will arrive on March 1. That, too, came and went. I went to my account for the third time, filed a complaint, and received an update saying the first issue would arrive May 1st. I'll never know, since I cancelled the order. Do yourself a favor...read the reviews and note that the last positive one was in 2007! Everything since then has been poor. I never write bad reviews, but this is the first. Again, don't order from Synapse, Services, Inc, unless you like staring at an empty mailbox."
1,Long lead time to receive magazine - still waiting,"Ordered 12/27. Amazon says they posted the subscription to Alternative Press 12/28. Alternative Press says they did not receive the order until 1/25, and I *should* receive the first magazine by 3/22 - I won't hold my breath. Nearly 12 weeks from order to first magazine (if it arrives when they are telling me). Based on other posts, it sounds like AP is likely the problem. For those of you who want to call AP, here's the # 800-339-2675. Maybe if enough of us call Amazon and AP, someone will fix the problem wherever it exists."
2,Alternative Press Magazine,"I got my first magazine today, but it wasn't the October issue like it was supposed to be first. I was wanting that issue so I could read about Green Day and Blood On The Dance Floor. Could you send me that one please."
3,Served its purpose,"Purchased as a ""gag gift"" for Christmas, and yes it served its purpose... Not that I had any great expectations for this product, but I give it 3 stars for the very stiff-yet-flimsy plastic. I didn't need this product to be durable, but if you are purchasing it for any reason that might require a bit of wear-and-tear, this might not be the product for you."
3,A decent 80's period piece,"Yeah, I read it. A decent story about 80's avarice and excess. But not nearly as good as James Stewart's ""Den of Thieves"" or ""Barbarians at the Gate."" I sold my copy at a yard sale - no great loss."
3,Cardboard caricature,"I recommend another book, like the one called ""Payback"", for a more sober view."
2,Good for what it sets out to do but really leaves a lot out,This is a decent overview of the malfeasance that was perpetuated by Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken. It however pails in comparison to the account that James Stewart presents in Den of Thieves. If you want to focus on the big event during one year this is a decent way to do it but you are really missing out on a much better account.
3,Pretty Good Song,"Tracks-1.Get Right Album Version2.Love Dont Cost a Thing RJ Schoolyard Mix featuring Fat Joe3.If you had my love Dark Child Remix Radio Edit4.Get Right Instrumental5.Get Right VideoYou put the disk in your computer and the video comes on right away, I still cant figure out how to access the songs on the computer, just the video-The disk is made in England and gives the number for ringtones available"
3,Historical source,"If you are a student of World's Fairs of the past, this DVD should be part of your collection.Presented in a smooth way (not Ken Burns), so as to keep interest."
5,Great place to start VBScript,"As a absolute beginner, I come to know what is VBScript, what it is and isn't, what can be done and how to do it step by step. It also includes comprehensive references information. It clearly shows the road map and points out the direction for people with various programming needs and learning levels. I can imagine that people from extensive programming experiences may find the book 'naive'. But for someone like me, I just cannot find anyone book better !"
5,VBScript A+,"This is one of the best reference books I have purchased in a while, things are really starting to pick-up speed now (repetitive tasks)."
4,"Not a reference on VBScript, but on HOW TO USE VBScript","This book isn't a reference in the way you would think, but it is good at showing you real world examples of how you'll end up using VBScript. If they really only wanted a reference book they would have just published the pages from Appendix A, which is the part of the book I end up referring to most, but not having an index makes it difficult. Overall, a good reference - not on the language itself, but on its implementation and uses."
3,Would be 5 star but for a MAJOR annoyance,"Other glowing recommendations are all accurate. HOWEVER, the book is not really a VBScript reference, it is more of a ""How to Implement VBScript"" manual. The entire VBScript functions reference is contained in an appendix, and (here is the REALLY annoying part) that appendix is not indexed! So, if you want to find the proper syntax for the 'Mid' statement (the sort of thing for which one might expect to turn to their VBScript Reference), do not bother going to the index and trying to look up 'Mid'. It's not there. Nor are the other VBScript functions. Instead you need to find the appendix, and skim through it to find what you need. Not a fatal flaw, but extremely annoying.If the rest of it were not so good I would have given this one star."
3,Wish the examples would work,"This book had a lot of discussion to educate somebody on the world of vbscript, but was very short with actual examples. My main beef as it is with most books is the examples. The section on page 377 on remote scripting would not work because they had some code positioned on the wrong area of the html page. I tried to download this code from their website only to find the html page blank."
5,great video,bought this for child and he loves it. the combo package is the way to go. can keep one in the portable player and one at home...
2,Too scary for my 3 year old,"While I like the new computer generated animation, I'm disappointed that the story was much more intense than most Thomas adventures. The scene where Diesel almost falls off a bridge had my 3-year-old son in tears. That's not at all what I expect when I pop in a Thomas movie. Parents be warned."
3,hate bugs inside,At first they would drop to the ground like in the ads but after 1 week (supposed to be good for 6 months) I found 2 fleas on kitty (she's a house cat) so....
5,Best I've Found,I love this stuff!! We have terrible spider and ant problems every summer and this stuff is brilliant!! Kills on contact and keeps them away! Going on a week now and they still haven't come back. It is odorless and tries fast. I have two kids so I wouldn't use something toxic but I needed something that worked. This stuff works without bothering my family.
4,I like it - bugs don't,"I sprayed this twice this year, and have noticed a steady decline in crickets and house bugs in and around my house. Its tough to say this product does this or that with a degree of certainty, but i can definately say that since starting to use this spray, I've seen less and less bugs.For the price, the peace of mind of not having little critters crawling around your house is well worth it!"
2,Didn't work at all for me!,I actually like the bottle and the design. Quick and easy to apply.But... the actual defense solution is AWFUL! I have a problem with ants and spiders in my shed and garage and it does nothing. I have used about half of the bottle in these small spaces and it has done nothing. I didn't expect it to keep spiders completely out but I had hopes about ants. NOPE! I have sprayed three times and haven't notices any difference. More spiders and the same amount of ants. Disappointing.I will still be searching...
1,Don't Use for Earwigs!,"Tired of dealing with spiders, and in prep for earwig season, I bought this product with high hopes of creating a defense shield around my house, windows, doorways, everywhere. I just love to have my windows and doors open all season long.The good news, the # of spiders coming into my house has dropped dramatically. I went from catching 4-6 per day to 1-2 over the past week.Bad news: 1 hour after soaking a slanted outdoor ledge underneath a window, I watched a young earwig crawl right over the treated area, he then proceeded into the cracks of my screen. 1 week later, earwigs are in full force, crossing any barrier I created with this product, and surviving. Finding them everywhere.I also watched a spider walk right on past, no sweat.So things are better, but the main goal was earwig prevention, and in that regard,this product failed miserably."
5,Did the trick,"Twice I put down a granular bug killer that did not seem to get the job done. I needed something to get the outdoor spiders under control. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to make this purchase. I sprayed around the house, trees, and bushes, and I have noticed a significant decrees in the number of webs."
2,Could of Been Better,I was very disappointed in this CD. The vocals for Amanda weren't as strong as previous CD's. The songs didn't grab me as they did on their second CD. I still love em and hopefully the next one will be better.
4,Great Book,"As an aspiring NFL scout, I read this book a few years ago. I still remember many of the points that Mr. Razzano discussed in this book. He stressed the value of watching a significant amount of tape on a player before formulating their grade. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to be a football scout or just wondering how it is done."
4,Great to look at Bo Derek,This movie will never be considered a classic but if you are a Bo Derek fan this will satisfy your craving for eye candy.
1,One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made!,This is one of the worst movies ever! It seems to just have been an excuse for the actress and her director husband to show off her naked body!
1,all about jane ;,The movie is mostly about jane and her father and tarzan is more of an afterthought this movie is a waste of time unless you are a big bo derek fan
3,You get what you pay for,"Works fine for video hooked up to plasma. Switch the ipod setting to video out. However, you cannot just play music through the audio (you have to have a video to play the audio for the video through the receiver/tv). Wish they made it so you could play your itunes song library through it as well, but great value for the money spent."
1,"It works, a little.",I just got the cords in the mail. The audio works but the video doesn't work at all. i tried two different ipods and neither works. I had both ipods set so the TV out was on and I even tried with it off. You can hear the song but the video doesn't show up. I do not recommend buying this.
2,I ordered the wrong thing,"This may be a good item, but it wasn't for my nano. I misread what it was for and when I got it, I was totally confused as to why my shows weren't on the television screen. had to reread. I think I was just so excited at the prospect of watching my movies on my television screen that I jumped the gun. I gave it to my uncle though and he said it works great!"
1,Cable,"This was not the cable I wanted, I will keep it anyway. The cable I wanted is a VGA cable so that I could watched things like Netflix from my iPhone to my tv"
1,Go away Sweet Valley Jr high..bring back the FUN books(svt?),"Sal surprises himself when he kisses his best friend Anna,now he is in a spot because he is already seeing Elizabeth and Anna doesn't know that."
5,home theater owners,"if u guys with a complete home theater system (BIG screen TV,dvd player and great sound system) don't own this dvd, don't know what you are missing! after calibrating your tv and sound system the performance is awesome.especially if you like me and the rest of the world who thought setting the sharpness to maximum level on tv looks better, this dvd is gonna dissapoint you. OWN THIS ONE AT ANY COST DESPITE THE PRICE1"
5,Perfect Video,"I hadn't worked out during my 4 years in college. I decided to buy this tape, based on good reviews and couldn't agree more. This video is perfect. You can start at your own level and make it more challenging for yourself as you get stronger. I feel more energized and my muscles feel toned and it definitely has reduced my stress level. Its been hard for me to be interested in working out, because I usually get bored. Not with this video. I do it almost every night before I go to bed. I can't get enough of it. Thank you MTV!"
4,intense workout,"I had a beginner's tape that was not doing anything for my body. However, when I purchased this workout and began using it, I also began noticing results. It runs about 30 minutes and hits most of my muscle groups. It is especially effective for the thighs, abdomen, and buttocks. I would recommend it to anyone who is a beginner at pilates."
1,Dead at 4 months.,"This is our third Sharp microwave in 5 years and it will be our last. The previous one started shooting sparks and while Sharp would warranty the parts at 3 years, they wouldn't warranty the labor, so we opted for a new one.This one was a little slower to heat and seemed to heat unevenly, but we could live with it.Last night, after dinner we noticed that it was flashing 88:88 and nothing we could do would reset it.Tried calling Sharp this morning for some ideas, but after a REALLY long phone tree, we got the name of a repair shop that is not open on the weekend.....Back it goes and we'll look for a better brand"
1,Don't even bother!!,"I saw this 'documentary' when it originally aired on Sci-Fi Channel as a special promo for the movie Village. It's not a documentary in any sense of the word, it's a 'mystery' that attempts to put a mystical spin on the life of filmmaker Shyamalan. What it is, is a lousy TV special that is overly long and is a bad Blair Witch-like ripoff.There is very little screen time with Shyamalan, and what is there is mostly garbage. None of this is really about Shyamalan. It's completely fictional. If the people being interviewed in here are really Shyamalan's friends and not actors I would be surprised. Don't even bother with this DVD."
1,Not what I thought,"I received this DVD thinking it was a true documentary. Unfortunately I didn't read the amazon reviews, or i would have known that this is a fictional work and not a documentary at all. If you want to know more about M. Night, DO NOT GET THIS. I thought this entire production was cheezy and very predictable. I felt i wasted my time watching this. If M. Night had a hand in creating this, it was only to put his face in it and receive royalties from sales. It sucks. Period."
5,Pure Fun!,"Anyone who knows about M Night will see the obvious holes in the story after the first few minutes. It is nothing more than tongue and cheek fun with M Night poking fun of himself. Although this is a ""mockumentary"" it was still fun to watch and I am glad I have it. People just need to lighten up and accept it for what it is."
2,ugh,"For the record, I was given this book for a Gender and Sexuality class and I must say, enough with books that teaches women to be neurotic and men-obsessed. The author is funny but she does NOT make any sense. The woman keeps contradicting herself. Her MAN-CATCHING LAW #1: Men want women they can't have and if that man cant have you they'll do anything to get you! She writes this in bold and is the very first advice she gives.... but then she dedicates a section to pretty much chasing men and teaches you strategies on how to ask them out."
3,Bought used book for work,Bought this book for a course I had to take for work. I bought it slightly used and it was perfectly acceptable. Good information about hormone replacement.
5,Hello Granny!,"This ""gift"" was for a woman that just turned 50 years old. A great idea for decorations and stuff needed for the perfect party!"
3,mostly boring,great idea and some of the articles are charming. but many are simply advertising for whatever the person does - a yoga guru etc. i got bored halfway through and dropped it. not worth the money for the few interesting chapters.
2,"Was great for awhile, but doesn't hold up","I puchased this pot at the same time that I puchased the Hard Anodized RR cookware. 2 years later, the cookware has help up beautifully. This pot, not so much. I have had zero problems with the handle, temperature, etc, that others have mentioned, as I tend to use it for ""low and slow"" type dishes in the oven, or on the stove for soups and chili. However, I was washing it this evening (by hand, no soap, as recommended) and I found a chip on the inside bottom of the pot. That got my attention, so I inspected the rest of the pot and lid. Sure enough, there are also a number of chips on the lid as well. 2 year of monthly (on average) use should not lead to this type of problem. Guess I'll be asking for the good stuff for Christmas!!"
4,Addicting...gotta keep reading,I love most of the Kaye Scarpetta series. This is definately one of the better novels!!
4,Predictable,"I had the opportunity to listen to this book when I was making a 9 hour drive. Not bad but predictable. Didn't put me to sleep obviously, but could have been a little less predictable. Would I read or listen to other books by Ms. Cornwell: Yes."
4,Gift matters,"If giving a gift, DON'T buy a can opener. This is a favorite autor of my wife's and she likes it. That's all that matters."
5,I think this book is the best Patricia Cornwell has written,This book is the best Patricia Cornwell has written as it keeps the reader wondering what will happen right until the end. Kay is really put through her paces as she tries to solve the murders and who the murderer is. When she is nearly killed at the end I was left holding my breath hoping she was alright. I highly recommend this book for all forensic pathology enthusiasts.
2,Review of purchase,I paid full price for this book which was the most expensive copy listed on Amazon.No where did it mention that it was coming without a dust jacket. Most of the others specifically mentioned that they did not have a dust jacket.I feel very strongly that I was misled into paying more money for something than what I had too considering it was not what I wanted.
2,Tedious plot complicated by inept descriptions.,"The plot of this novel plods along slowly with several useless side bars. If you can stick out the first 100+ pages, the second half of the book picks up the pace. However, the reader is insulted throughout with ridiculous descriptions. One example would be explaining that a black man's voice sounds like Eddie Murphy. Clever. The book could have easily been edited down to 250 pages. Subplots with a niece and a potential lover are really worthless. If the second part of the book wasn't at least readable (for the most part), then this novel would be a complete waste."
1,Not as good as I have heard.,"After being told how great this book was i decided to pick it out. Unfortunatly I found this book very tedious in places. There is too much time spent on the main characters relationships and sentimental nonsense for my liking. It has been said that her books are more appealing to women than men. I now feel that is very much the case. Most of the girls I know think it is great, most of the guys don't care about the niece or whether the cop likes the main character. On the plus side she does have a good understanding of the workings of the homicide unit and of the way crimes are investigated and this does come across in her writing."
2,Slow & Steady Doesn't Win The Race In This Yawner!,"I've heard good things about the Kay Scarpetta series but this introduction to the character didn't really show me much. I was underwhelmed by the ""drama"" and all the characters seemed very transparently one note. The 10 year old alcohol-drinking, cussing niece didn't make sense. Maybe if I had read this when it first came out the computer and DNA talk would have been more riveting instead of tedious. Not much here to keep you turning the pages."
5,scarpetta,Love patricia cornwell books. I like the kindle version and also I buy audio books too. Have several of her books. Love mysteries and investigating things
4,I love it when a plot comes together,"This is Patricia Cornwell's first novel. I have read a number of her books in this series and decided to go back to the beginning to see where and how it all began for Kay Scrapetta. Here we are introduced to characters we meet time and time again in subsequent books in the series. I enjoyed this book as we are kept guessing who ""Mr Nobody"" is. When I find an author I like I begin at the top of his/her list of books and read them all. I sill have a number of Cornwell/Scrapetta on my pile of to read books."
2,OVERPRICED AND OVERHYPED,"THE ONLY THING ABOUT THE COLD GEAR IS THAT'S WHAT IT IS COLD. I'D DO BETTER WITH THERMAL WEAR AT A BETTER FAR BETTER PRICE. I ALREADY HAVE TWO HOLES IN MY LEGGINGS. WOW. WHAT A RIP. ANOTHER NAME BRAND PRODUCT MADE OVERSEAS, AND OVERPRICED SOLD TO THE GULLABLE CONSUMER. VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED."
4,"Great for sports, but not much more.","I work outdoors year around refueling airplanes at an airport. I was looking for something to keep me warm than was not bulky. The under aurmor is skin tight and very light weight.My job consists of spurts of high-paced physical work, followed by short periods of waiting (standing still.) While I'm working hard, it keeps me very warm, but it becomes very cold when I slow down and it does not block the wind at all. It also becomes very uncomfortable after a few hours.It is a great buy for being physically active for a half hour or so then taking it off, but it is not coat; its not made for being worn outside for nine hours."
2,Like dull films? Then this is for you...,"Having heard this was a good film through word of mouth, I hunted it down expecting good things. Unfortunately, this film did not deliver. From around 10 minutes in, I had to consistently fight the urge to hit the eject button on my remote control. In the end I persisted and watched the whole thing. I shouldn't have wasted my time. This film is excrutiatingly boring. Nothing happens. I'm not completely certain what the target audience for this film is, so maybe I'm missing the point. I have a feeling it's a bit of a ""chick flick"" (pardon the expression). Avoid at all costs..."
5,A MUST SEE AND A MUST HAVE,"Have you ever watched a movie that stayed with you for days after? This movie was so underrated I almost past on it, but I was capitivated by it's ""simple"" beauty. A movie with little dialog having to rely on the actors moment and scenery to convey feelings. I think Sophia Coppola did a wonderful job directing this movie, and allowing the audience to think for themselves. I say it is a must buy because you will want to watch it over and over again."
4,Great adaptation of the book!,"I loved the book The Virgin Suicides by Jeffery Eugenides, and was so happy when I saw how great the movie is. The story is thoughtful and gripping and the movie captures the author's story beautifully and magically. The story centers around mid-1970's teenage boys who are obsessed with their neighbors, the beautiful Lisbon girls. James Woods puts in a wonderful performance as Mr. Lisbon, father to the five daughters who, throughout the course of a year, all commit suicide for subtle reasons that lie throughout the movie. As it unfolds, we discover the hardships of the disfunctional Lisbon family and what drove the girls to commit suicide. Kirsten Dunst also does a stellar job of playing the provocative 15 year-old Lux Lisbon, who enraptures the hearts of all men she meets, including Josh Hartnett."
3,Kind of good,"The movie explores the mystery of mystique, seclusion, and youth, albeit brief and obtuse in its exploration. I dunno. I liked some scenes in the middle and pretty much the end of the movie, but I just wasn't very satisfied. I felt kind of left hanging, maybe even a bit cheated, I guess. Most all the actors were fine. Woods is the obvious standout (which is a nice change considering I usually loathe him). I enjoyed the use of the songs, even though there were some glaring anachronisms. Air's score's neat. I think it's worth watching, but I don't think I'd own it. I remember thinking right after I saw it that I would have enjoyed it much more as a teenager. That's not teen bashing, I just think it would have appealed more to the mindset I had as a teen."
4,"tragically beautiful, yet haunting two weeks later","I'm not going to summarize too much, I see a lot of other people have done that. The film is an emotionally complex story, and normally that would be enough for virgin suicides, but it is so beautifully shot, it enhances the story. The final scene is a good example. When the credits go up and the lights go on, the cast and composition are in your thoughts for atleast two weeks. If only Kirsten Dunst would focus on more dramatic roles I'd be a bigger fan. Sofia Coppola definetly has a career to watch."
1,Bad,"I am very confused by all the praise this film is receiving. It tried way to hard, and ended up just being pretentious and over-done. It tries so hard to be ""deep"" and ""moving"" but it just ends up being two hours of poorly executed egotistical film school drivle... I honestly cannot think of one good thing to say about it. I would avoid it at all costs."
1,EMPTY FRAMES,"This is a film about five attractive teenaged sisters from a rather ordinary middle-class family who all committ suicide. That's the big shocker, the big selling point that the book this movie was based on used to make it a best seller, the big plot innovation. Outside of the five suicides, there really is no plot development. The movie is told from the viewpoint of one of a group of boys, over the vantage point of about 25 years, who like these pretty girls and watch them from across the street. The characters are one-dimensional and cartoonish. It's as though the director would like to make some profound statement about the human condition, and thinks that just having the five suicides, sans any real motive or character or plot development, is enough to carry the day. Sorry. Maybe David Lynch could have made a good movie using this premise, but not Sofia Coppola. Oh, and guess what, the title is a lie. As is amply demonstrated, one of the girls isn't even a virgin."
2,Is this supposed to be a comedy or tragedy?,"I couldn't decide if 'The Virgin Suicides' was a comedy or a tragedy. Or was it both at the same time? Sort of odd, considering it was about depression and suicide. To me, the movie didn't take itself and the characters very seriously. We are introduced to the characters, but we never fully know them. The suicide of the first girl looks so bizzare that I couldn't decide if it was supposed to be sad or funny.After the first girl dies, the story goes downhill with implausable characters and a thin storyline. Too many unrealistic things happen and then the movie is over. We are only left with the unknown."
1,This is very strange.,"This video is exteremely strange. It is definitely not a family movie, and the ending.....Well, I could definitely write better then this. I would say that this is like Eyes Wide Shut. Though this movie does have meaning, it is very choppy, and though it is hard to imagine that this happened in real life. I don't like how the it is narrated, and I think that people who don't want to waste time and money should neither buy it, or rent it."
2,Just a bit too predictable,"This was a pretty good first draft of a film. A really good director and editor might be able to take out some of the ridiculously self conscious, incongruous stuff (like a boy narrator near the end saying how he now had some understanding of what a prison it was to be a girl, but how wonderful it was at the same time because girls were inspired to think. Do boys outside of extreme feminist dreams ever say things like this?)and add a few scenes to tie it all together.Some of it was quite clever. It was just a bit too pat. Most of the characters had their cardboard cutout existence which couldn't be fleshed out lest it deter the tunnel vision plot."
3,"Do yourself a favor, and read the book instead","I read the book first, and I was blown away. So when I sat down to watch the movie, I was expecting.... more. I realize that to condense a book into an hour and a half long movie, they have to cut certain parts, and not everything will be explained as well as in the book, but I felt that this movie left out a LOT of what made the book so spectacular. The narrator has a much smaller part in the movie than in the book, which leaves a lot more to the imagination (which can sometimes be a good thing, but not in this case), and a lot of the more heart-wrenching details from the book have been cut to make room for cheesy, overly artistic camera work. The ""daydream"" at the end when the boys are in the house was way too over the top in my opinion. Overall, I felt the movie lacked a lot of what made the book incredible."
2,It's Good to Get if You are Wondering About PRISM,"There's a good reason to read it - it's cheaper than buying the entire plan first and then wishing you hadn't. However, in all fairness, I did not buy the whole weight plan, so I can't fairly assess it. I mostly disliked the repetitiveness of the book. I personally did not feel inspired."
2,not user-friendly,"I have had a rather hard time finding suitable materials for my 8-12 years old Sunday school class. I tried this book, but have felt rather disappointed. Each lesson was not very well-constructed, hard to follow and spot the point. The content was also rigid. It tells you what exactly to say rather than guide you to create a fun environment. I don't think the book can provide lessons that speak effectively to the active young generation with short attention span."
2,Perfectly Lovely School Research Paper,"Reckless is NOT a true crime book. It's a biography of Phil Spector - and not a very inspired one. There is no indication that Carlton Smith spoke to anyone involved with this case, and it's not an ancient case with all the key players dead.If you like student research papers where the author simply looks at the other books and articles written about something and then checks in with personal observations, then that's what you get here. An overview of the literature. Some unqualified personal observations. And, he says the same thing over and over and over again.Very boring. And it could have been a great story."
1,Not about the death in the castle.,"Instead, Mr. Smith delivers a one-sided slam against Phil Spector who according to the author hasn't done one nice thing during his whole life. It's amazing that St. Martin's Press would publish such a biased book while a court case is going on."
3,A LOOK AT SOME INTERESTING VIKINGS,"THIS IS NICE READ ABOUT SOME OF THE MORE INTERESTING AND CONTROVERSIAL VIKINGS. IT COVERS NORM VAN BROCKLIN, CHRIS CARTER, BUD GRANT, FRAN TARKENTON, RANDY MOSS AND MANY OTHERS. A LOOK AT SOME OF THE GREATS OF TODAY AND THE PAST. TO ME IT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH. TOO SHORT AND NOT DETAILED. BUT STILL A NICE READ FOR VIKING FANS WHO STILL WONDER WHEN WILL THEY WIN A SUPERBOWL. NOT TOO SOON."
5,Afrocentricity,This is a very informative and helpful book. I have learned a lot and seriously recommend that everyone read it!
4,Voodoo plot,"While Bat Wing doesn't compare to Sax Rohmer's best work (the Fu Manchu series), it's a typical pulp era mystery his fans should enjoy anyhow.Bat Wing features a voodoo plot, mysterious and exotic women, obtuse British police officers, and one of the most impressive of villains, all told in a leisurely manor house mystery style. I'd read it again some day."
4,Good practical step by step tips,"I really liked this one for its practical step by step tips. It was written I think before some of his videos. So the ground work he details in the book is pre the ""7 Games"" that he now markets. But it is mostly the same thing. This is the closest to a ""how to"" you can find on his ideas. It is often repetitive, but sometimes reading the same concept several times helps it sink in better, so I don't mind. I am reading this one, have watched some of his videos and I also use the ideas by Mark Rashid. Mark is a little less invasive with horses. I think both of these trainers have great ideas I'm using in my own horsemanship."
2,It's not the best book out there.,"To be ""nice"" I give this book a ""2 star"" as it interesting reading. There are now a lot of other books available that I would recommend rather than this book.This book offers a structured approach that people find comfortable but I would recommend that if you do buy this book also buy Mark Rashid's book, ""Horses Never Lie: The Heart of Passive Leadership,"" and/or Marty Marten's book ""Problem Solving, Preventing and Solving Common Horse Problems"" and/or ""True Horsemanship Through Feel"" by Leslie Desmond and Bill Dorrance."
3,Primer for Natural Horsemanship,"If you would like to find out about the Parelli method of Natural Horsemanship (using an understanding of how a horse thinks to train him and form a life-long bond) this is a good place to start. The writing is basic and repetitive, but it definitely gets the concepts across and gives you a blueprint for working with your horse. This is one of Pat's earlier books. Now the Parelli school of training is a world-wide enterprise with slick (and very expensive) training materials. Still, the technique is sound and gets great results!"
5,More practical than Lyons,"I like the way Pat organizes his material. I read this and Lyon's on horses book at the same time. I don't remember anything from that book (it was more concept oriented), but I remember and use both concepts and exercises/training techniques from this book 6 mo after reading it."
4,Well worth it,"I really liked this book alot. I think that Pat Parelli is a wonderful teacher and this is a great way to work with a horse not against it like so many other trainers do. If i had to say a negative, i would say that he promotes that you buy all sorts of tack, etc. I do like the halter (which can be handmade btw) and the lead with popper though. I will definitely buy any other book or video by him."
2,Disappointing,"I LOVE MANA I BUY ALL THEIR MATERIAL MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO 5 OF THEIR AMAR ES COMBATIR CONCERTS SO WHEN I GOT MY ARDE EL CIELO DVD I WAS EXPECTING MORE. THERES NO BEHIND THE SCENES,NO COMENTS BY THE BAND NOTHING!!!!!JUST 12 SONGS OUT OF THEIR PUERTO RICO CONCERT.SAVE 20 BUCKS AND GO TO YOU TUBE YOU WILL FIND A LOT MORE FOOTAGE!!!!"
5,This is some great stuff!!!,"If you have to avoid sugar and miss marshmallow life is good again. This marshmallow is delicious, has the perfect consistency and lasts and lasts. Hot chocolate, fluffer butter sandwiches, home made sugar free rocky road ice cream - you can have it all now!!! Plus the people at A Bountiful Harvest are wonderful."
2,Marshmallow Cream NOT!!,I was very disappointed. It has a definite after taste. I was surprised at the small container size. After tasting I was glad it was small. Would I order it again? Yuck!!
3,gimmick.,"The product is exactly as advertised... but the end results are not what I was hoping for... the shells don't taste right after they've been cooked... your taco salad may as well be served in a piece of Styrofoam. The middles are left ""half-baked"" while edges get hard and start to burn. I tried these with spray oil, without, flour, corn, and whole wheat... the flour tortillas work the best (actually they were the only ones I would eat... the others just didn't' taste right).Overall, it is a novelty item I could live without... in hindsight I would not purchase these again."
3,Would it have killed them to have the DVD set so that,"the DVDs wouldn't fly out every single time I opened the flaps? Geez. Pretty crummy packaging in my opinion.The show is pretty good--reminiscent of THE 4400, at least to me."
5,worth the money,"After watching this series, you will be quoting particle physics principles with the best of them. The characters are awesome, the plots are new. Definitely new. Saw an episode in a hotel on a business trip. Had to buy it. The sheriff is ""everyman"" in a town full of ""non-everymens & women"". Oh, and the christmas episodes....awesome."
1,One of the worst shows I have ever seen,A very silly show with bad acting. Do not waste your time or money. Not much more left to say.....
5,Eureka Season 2,"Really enjoy this light hearted sci fi show and very happy with the service from Amazon, though the DVD case production could be better, the discs become dislodged to easily and fall around inside the case."
5,Great Service,I had great and fast service when I ordered Eureka season 1. I live in Europe and have an APO address and sometimes have to wait 4 or 5 weeks for items to be delivered. Amazon shipped my order to me quickly.Great Job!!!!
3,Saved Best For Last,Great premise! Maybe second season will be better. The last episode showed more promise than previous episodes. Neat characters. All pretty likable.
3,"Great show, crappy product.","I like the show and think it is a really original show, and original plot. But I give it three stars based on the actual packaging of the show. It was not a plastic dvd case, but was instead a styrofoam like substance. The DVDs did not stay in the case at all and I was disappointed with that aspect. Like I said, great show, crappy product."
5,hey look at this....,"man you must be bored out of your as*, but anyway I finally remembered, the sheriff's daughter sounds exactly like ""Ashley"" from Resident Evil 4. (the game)"
5,Quirky,"We love this series at our house - the kids couldn't wait to see all of the episodes! It's quirky, good clean fun. It stretches the imagination and makes it cool to be a scientist. We're looking forward to many more seasons of EUREKA."
1,Intelligence-insulting drivel.,"It's hard to believe all these great reviews. This show tries way too hard to develop a Northern Exposure-like cast of quirky characters. It also tries way too hard to convince you that everyone in town is a super-genius a la ""Real Genius"" with Val Kilmer. However, the real trouble starts when the entire town comes together and starts finishing each others' sentences - solving impossibly complicated problems with a few minutes of facile, preposterous techno-babble. It's enough to make me long for the plausibility of the worst episodes of Star Trek Voyager, if not a quick death. I wonder how Hollywood executives thought that writing a show about geniuses and mind-bending science at an elementary school level of sophistication would be a good idea... oh yeah, all those great reviews. Never mind."
5,"Eureka is an excellent, smart television series!","While I have never caught this show on Sci-Fi, I recently picked up season one. I had expectations that it might be good. Honestly, this show is quickly growing to become one of my favorite television shows anywhere. The smart storylines keep you wondering where things will go next.I can honestly say that this is one of the very few times I've put a DVD series in and pressed ""Play All"" that I've proceeded to watch almost ALL!I strongly suggest this show!"
4,"The show is great, the package not so great","Is funny, highly entertaining, dramatic and definitely worth watching. For the fans of Light Sci Fi, is a must.The package on the other hand is really bad. Is fails to keep the Disks in Place, and is unnecessarily bulky.3 DVD's, I recommend them."
4,Good Product.............but,"I really like this product and ordered 2 of them. But I really wish the stems were about an inch or two longer. Thankfully, the mirror part swivels in many directions and you can adjust it for good visibility, but if it was longer, it would be much better. All in all, it is a great mirror."
3,rear view bike mirror,"Good size, good image. Mirror won't stay in position as lock nut for mirror is not sufficiently tighten-able."
3,Annoying,"It's sturdy, installs well and you can see behind you fairly well but we rarely utilized it and found it annoying and in the way, we removed ours."
2,Clamp is weak,"I'ts a big mirror and has a nice look to it, but the clamp can't handle the weight of the mirror and it tends to start sliding around not long after installation."
4,Nautica Seaport Twill Comforter,"I bought this for my college age son's bed. I bought the twin size and it fits the bed perfectly. It is very ""warm"". So if you are a hot natured person, you may want to lay it over a chair at night. If you don't have a large capacity washing machine, you may want to take it to a laundramat for cleaning."
3,"WELL, I GIVE THEM 3 STARS FOR A GOOD EFFORT","BAMBINO AND PHALOS ARE TALENTED LYRICISTS, BUT IT'S JUST THAT, SOME OF THE SONGS ON THIS CD JUST AIN'T FUNKY. BUT THE SONGS THAT ARE FUNKY, I'M TALKING ABOUT ''PLAYA WAYZ'', ''RICHTOR SCALE'', ''IT DON'T MAKE ME'', AND ESPECIALLY ''MOVE MAKERS'', WHICH IS BY FAR THE BEST SONG ON THIS ENTIRE ALBUM. WELL, EVEN THOUGH THIS ALBUM REALLY ISN'T ALL THAT, I GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR AT LEAST TRYING. BUT, DON'T WORRY, THIS ALBUM AIN'T A TOTAL WASTE, AT LEAST IT IS BETTER THAN 75 PERCENT OF THE BULLSH** THAT'S BEING PLAYED ON RAP RADIO TODAY."
1,broken and broken,"i normally dont bother writing reviews but i was so disapointed in this product i figured i'd save someone else the hassle. the manufacturer hasnt put any effort into making a functional product. I received product as described but when i put the batteries in it did not shoot anything resembling a mist or a stream or anything else, it was barely able to squirt out a little spittle, i have been looking for a good handheld sprayer for a while and this is definitely not it. on top of that the connection for the hose never connected well to the reservoir AND the plastic connector piece physically broke just from trying to test the product out (i am gentle on things and was not putting any pressure on the part, so it broke just from being barely touched)"
1,A book with a misleading title.,"Though the book's title indicates that it is about applied computational design methods in control, the book is not for the practicioner. It is essentially an extension of the now old L1 control theory (See Dahleh's other book).For the engineer, little of use is in this book. For the functional analyst, the mathematics are known: Apply the Hahn Banach theorem, obtain a linear program, look at duality gaps, etc., and the book gives little insight into control design issues."
5,Fun to read aloud!,"This is one of my 3 year olds favorite books. We read it a least every-other day and he always loves it. After we read the book we have to ""act it out"" he pretends to make me breakfast, make a card with hearts on it, while mimicking what the little pig says...""no peeking Mommy""...""Did I surprise you Mommy?"" The pictures are great and very cute."
4,Learning to write poetry,"The booked arrived quickly and in excellent condition. I am reading through the ""course in writing poetry"" and have found it quite helpful with the practice suggestions."
5,"A truly sensational album, full of masterful classics","This album really introduces Gene to the world.It contains classics such as We could be kings, and Speak to me Someone. This album deserves to be part of your collection. It is full of the kind of rocky songs that stick in your mind, and really make you wake up and relise the potential of this band.Martin Rositer on Lead vocals puts so much Welsh passion into his performance it makes each track stand out on its own merits.What can I say? If you like rock/indie buy this album now!!!"
1,Unhelpful,"I did not find this book helpful at all. This is one of the worst writing books I have ever read. I purchased this based upon it being mentioned on the BluRay for the television show LOST. I really admire the writing on the show, and thought that this might be a personal recommendation by the show's writers. I am vastly disappointed with the book. I did not find one single part insightful. Other writing books that I would recommend instead would be any of the books by Noah Lukeman, but especially A Dash of Style. Another one that I would highly recommend is Techniques of the Selling Writer by Dwight Swain. All of these are worth their weight in gold. Skip this book."
2,Greatest hits.,Wanted Karaoke version and two songs didnt even play. I thought It was the Karaoke version I was ordering. Good songs tho.
3,Poorly Laid out but some good exercises,"Most of the exercises are good and one usually comes to them naturally. It's a good reference to get a base set of things to do with your child. The only problem is it's poorly laid out meaning some of the sets are birth - 3 months with another set being birth to 6 months. Why not have them birth, 3 months, 6 months etc. The pictures are somewhat useless as well in that they show a guy and a child smiling. Diagrams with how the exercises should be performed might be a bit better."
1,Wasn't Helpful,"Got this for my hubby for Christmas last year. He opened it a few times. Was not impressed with the ""games"" they had in there. Pretty obvious type things, or variations of the same game, or just strange ones. To actually purchase a book and then have it give ""airplane"" as an example of a unique game to play with a toddler? Come on! Who doesn't know how to fly an infant around on their arms, or to bounce them on their knee? We're new parents too, so it's not like we knew all the games there are...but the ones we didn't know were just lame. Not worth a $1 in my opinion! Wish I hadn't spend the $$ on this, we ended up giving it away."
2,William Faulkner,"This book is a very good comination of two of the greatest works by William Faulkner. The Sound and the Fury is carefully written using stream of consciousness refering to a sibling of the family. Even the very last sentence can easily take the reader back to the very first sentence. It is beautifully written, as well as As I Lay Dying. As I Lay Dying is written in many perspective's of each person in the family. The full story is obtained through reading through each person's mind and opinions and happenings. A suprise ending adds to the punch of this book. Both of these novels (combined into one book) are stories that critics and others seem to love, cherish, and remember for a long time."
5,This soup is so good....,"...that I actually went all the way to Amazon to purchase it. It is very tasty, but healthy (and I am no health nut), with lots of protein and it makes you feel satisfied but not really food. Great for your diet. I use it as soup only or as pasta sauce. I only wish it were available in all supermarkets."
3,Bearings falling out of the casters after a few months,"I really wanted to like this. It worked well until the ball bearings started falling out of the casters, only after less than 3 months after I purchased it. I didn't realize the warranty is only for 3 months. I called them when the second caster had ball bearings falling out, (6 months after purchasing). They said there was nothing they could do since it is out of warranty, and this would be considered normal wear & tear. I in no way abused the chair and even tightened the bolts every now and then.How can this be normal wear & tear only after a few months of gentle use?"
4,Comprehensive overview,The book covers in some detail most of the important sites and locations that I will be visiting on on up-coming trip to Mongolia. I feel better prepared.
4,Otro clasico de los soundtracks,Este disco es de los que inagura la llegada del hipo hop-rap a este genero y seria uno de los ùltimos exitos comerciales de Bobby Brown. Buena musica aunque la película no fue de los mejor.
1,Bad Choice,"I purchased one and received it, it never worked right. I received a replacement and have had the same problem. I think this model is a waste of money unless they fix the bugs. It just keeps saying you have to repair the disk with software that does not come with it."
4,Great Product!,I am very pleased with this item. I've purchased it for my step son who turned 13 and I happy to be able to share the music I grew up with him along side. It's very user friendly and shipping was right on time.
2,Too General Is Right!,"If you're looking for specific directions, keep looking -- this isn't it. It provides a decent description of all areas in the HR module but doesn't go much further. If you're new to the SAP R/3 HR arena, this will give you a good idea of the capabilities/functionalities of this module. If you're a veteran, you probably won't get a whole lot from it."
1,don't make the mistake,I bought this book with lot of expectation. This book is not a help at all. Please don't buy this book. I will reccommend to buy Mastering HR Management with SAP.
1,Save your money to take an SAP class,"I'm part of a team implementing 4 sub-modules of the HR Module - Personnel Admin, Org Management, Benefits and Payroll. This book was useless in helping to explain (from a functional or a technical standpoint) how to implement or use those four pieces. It was useless in helping to understand how Payroll interfaced with FICO.This is not a book for novices. I'd be surprised if it was a book for experts, but maybe in a couple of years it will be a handy reference. Until then, I'll be using it to press flowers.If you need information attend the SAP courses."
5,That demanding mouse is back for another adventure!,"I bought this for my soon to be three year old daughter because she loves the other books in this series so much (if you give a mouse a cookie, a pig a pancake, etc.). I was glad to see mouse going to school. I am currently trying to warm my daughter up to the idea of attending a preschool. Thanks to mouse and his human boy friend school looks like a fun place to be. The boy in this story reminds me somewhat of myself. Always trying to satisfy the insatiable demands of a mouse or in my case the demands of a preschooler. Parents and kids will enjoy reading this book together. A great addition to the series."
3,If You Take a Mouse to School (If You Give...),"ISBN 0060283289 - The series of ""If You..."" books from Laura Numeroff is great, but this one is a little bit less spectacular than the others. It's not a bad book, and kids will enjoy it, but it simply doesn't measure up to the others.If you take a mouse to school, all manner of things are likely to happen. He'll ask for your lunchbox, a sandwich, paper and pencils and so much more! Where will it all end?The usual pattern in these books is that each thing hinges on the thing before and leads to the next thing; in this book, those connections aren't quite there. Felicia Bond's illustrations are superb. They're big and bright and cute and they make up a lot for the failure of the author to come through this time.- AnnaLovesBooks"
4,Fun book - maybe 4 1/2 stars,"My 4-year old really likes it. The writing style and pacing is very ""in tune"" with him - on the first reading, he seemed to know what was coming next, and guessed the last line perfectly. We've already read it several times, so it's definately a keeper."
3,"Good start, but be prepared to improvise","I've made the crib set (the quilt, bumper pad, dust ruffle, and headboard pad). Some of the measurements on the quilt were a little wacky and the directions get real hazy regarding the back of the quilt, but other than that, if you have a basic familiarity with a sewing machine, you should be able to handle most of these projects (give or take a little ingenuity).This is not a ""how to sew"" book, though..you should have some experience before you get into this one."
4,Gripping and impressive debut,"This debut novel works on many different levels. It's a compelling page turner. It's a slice of history. It's a powerful anti-war story. You get the picture. Mullen brings the reader into the isolated backwoods town of Commonwealth, Washington, during the waning days of WWI and the great flu of that period. It's a small snapshot of those times but Mullen fills the canvas with big sweeping ideas. The story just naturally seems to fall to the page. Take a group of people, isolate them in the wilderness, let disease and violence gallop through the ranks, and then see what happens. The protagonist Philip was my only problem with the story. He just wasn't the interesting. It's a small quibble. Can't wait to read Mullen's next work."
5,The Last Town on Earth,Very well written. I love how the characters were developed. Excellent read.I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in the plague during the Middle Ages.
2,boring and predictable,"This story moves too slowly and I lost interest midway through the book. The writing seemed stilted, too. I don't recommend it."
2,All downhill after the third chapter,"The Prologue was riveting, and the first two chapters held my attention. Then it seemed that another writer took control: the prose became wooden, the dialogue sounded manufactured, and the characters felt one-dimensional ... so much so that reading became a chore; I didn't finish the book."
4,Large,"I just received this and yes it is shiny, has a nice chain that holds this large 2"" by 2"" inch nice looking, heavy duty, sterling silver circle. But the circle is too large for my taste. It is a nice peice of jewelry if you like LARGE jewery."
2,damaged,"i've received this watch today, and it is not like in the picture. the corpus of is little damaged! but, anyway, i hope that my mom will like it."
2,"Nice, but not what the picture looks like","The watch is nice. But, the photo is not an accurate picture of what the watch looks like. Each diamond looks bright, but the actual diamonds are small and sparkle in direct light. I was disappointed but I am keeping it because for the price it is a nice watch. Just not what I really wanted."
5,One of the best ever ! ! !,"The title song ranks near the top as one of the best ""all time"" songs ever recorded. The rest of the album is just better than average. You cannot go wrong here."
1,Who is this guy kidding?,"A little of this self-serving ode goes a very long way. I cannot imagine anyone reading it straight through; but rather, it is excellent bathroom reading, to be opened and shut quickly. One gets the feeling that the author wishes he were Jackie O. himself, and that by writing this he has somehow possessed her or claimed her. It is, quite simply, a sick symptom of the celebrity obsession of our culture, being passed off as East Coast intellectualism. There is nothing intellectual about it. The fact that it is written by a male makes it even creepier. I had to dispoae of my copy, which I found at a yard sale."
3,"a/ka/ ""Jackie, Skinned Alive"" ...","Amusing, if exhausting, fact-fantasia by an author who adores his subject."
1,Not worth the money,"Scaled down to say the least, the playing field is very limited, bumpers are very weak, the skill shot to open play does not work well. The area between the flippers and the large exit lanes make it difficult to keep the ball in play. You should play this game prior to shelling out the money. I don't think I would have purchased it if I played it prior to purchasing."
5,My favorite cook books - bar none.,"My daughter signed up for Marlboro gifts at some time during her smoking life then left for England so the gifts ended up in my posession. This was the first thing that they sent and I couldn't believe that they were giving something of this calibre as a freebie.The pictures are beautiful, the recipes are right down my alley as good basic southwestern cooking and everything I have tried has been excellent to good (the cyclone chili recipe is worth the price of the book). I have now collected all of the Marlboro cookbooks and they are the most prized books in my extensive collection.I ended up having to buy a set for my daughter, who saw them and decided that I had stolen them from her even though I only got this one for free."
5,Earth From Above,I gave this to my mother who teaches a student with learning disabilities and she said it helped him get a perspective that had otherwise eluded him. It is a large book that needs a coffee table on which to reside because it is fascinating to look through. My own space does not include a surface appropriate for this to be displayed so I give it to those with space and visit them. Great Book which I got from Amazon at an affordable price gently used.
5,Amazing experience,The images and stories that go with them are compelling and informative about the status of this world we live in. They are beautiful and give a powerful perspective on the Earth from a view we can not see as we walk on the ground. Amazing experience to share. I have now given it as gifts to over 10 clients and friends.
2,Decent Phone Poor Design,"I didn't like the UI on the phone too much. The pictures from the camera aren't very much to look at. The worst part however is that the LCD screen is very easily broken. Mine lasted 3 months before I broke mine, and it costs 135 to replace -- almost the same cost as a new phone. Not Recommended."
4,"V220,,,,,,Good & tough phone","We've had our V220 phones for nearly 2 years & they have proved to be very dependable & quite tough as well! I've dropped mine more times than i can count on my concrete porch, out of my truck, kicked it into a curb once & it still works well. Call quality is good. Signal is weak sometimes but I blame that on conditions & my network.(Cingular) I have experienced the screen going blank once, but i took the SIM card out for a minute or so then reinserted it & things were fine. I also had a problem with the headset connection once,(wouldn't connect) but that ended up being the end of the plug on the handsfree broke of in the phone. Not the phones fault. As far as the camera goes,,,It's a phone!! if you want high quality photos, get a digital camera. That being said, it can take decent pics. Overall, these have been great phones for my wife & myself."
2,Very disappointed,"Ready to buy a new phone but did manage to keep this for the year contract without having to return it. The camera, though, is awful and the picture quality is rubbish. The phone scratches easily and sometimes I do not receive calls and am told I have missed calls days later. I also sometimes have problems hearing the ringer and the vibration is not strong."
2,two days of battery life and impossible to download pictures,"So far the phone works, but there are two major dissapointments:* The battery life is only about two days. Yes, I followed the instruction and went through a couple of full charge cycles.* There is a camera in the phone and the USB port. But Motorola decided to squeeze more money from their customers, so they do not provide the drivers that allow you to download the pictures from phone to your computer. What is the purpose for having the camera if you cannot use it?! You have to pay separately to purchase the drivers from Motorola."
1,Waste of money,"This phone is a piece of JUNK!!!!!My daughter has this phone & it has been nothing but TROUBLE from the beginning. We have had to send it back in & have a replacement sent to us 3 times in less than a year. The camera stops working, the address book deletes itself, calls are dropped for no reason, her voicemail stopped working, all reception has been lost both inside & outside...WHAT A JOKE...Motorola & Cingular should be ashamed of themselves!"
2,V220 freezes for no reason,"It worked 2 days after I purchased it and Freezed for no reason.Removing SIM made it start the first time.Next time when I switched it off in church, it never came back.Tried removing battery /sim etc and thought it must be battery charge and charged for a whole day. But nope. Got to take it back to Cingular this weekend.-Alex"
4,Pretty Good Phone,"This is a decent phone, but not worth as much as it costs. It has a color screen and camera but both are pointless. The screen is so small it is almost unusable, and the pictures turn out blurry and washed out. Other than that it is a good phone. I would not recommend it."
1,v220 lack alot,"I have always had a motorola cell phone but the v220 is a big let down. It looks, feels, and operates like a cheap phone."
2,Screen Problem......,"Just like many have already stated, my screen died after six months... Stay Away!!! Trying to get a replacement, and hopefully this one will work."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!,"My problems all started when the camera stopped working and then the antenna fell out and the screen went black, all right when the warranty expired."
1,Drops 15% of all calls,"Horrible phone - drops at least 15% of all calls, doesn't ring all the time, software glitchy and crashes. I have had two separate v220s with the same problems. Don't get motorola. I miss my old grayscale denon candybar from sprint..."
2,Hello Crapo,This phone was a huge dissapointment. The screen is small and you can barely hear any of the ring tones. Even though you can set up the quick keys to your liking nothing seems accessible because the phone is really cramped.Perhaps a person with dainty hands and lot of time to navigate through the sub-standard menu navigtion would love this phone. I do not.The camera does take decent shots with adequate lighting.I was a faithful Motorola customer...
2,Did not do what I had hoped.,"All the reviews were good so I was hoping this would take the check engine light off. It didn't, not even for a second, which makes me sad since its very expensive to replace the cat. My state doesn't have emissions testing but if I ever want to sell my car, its going to be difficult. I'm think about buying another can just to see. I noticed some people said they used two cans. Although I noticed my car was running better when I put it in and my gas mileage was way better, but its back to normal. Anyway, here's hoping the next can works..."
4,This is a good product,I have used other CHI products and they all work great and this product is not an exception. I would recommend this to others.
2,Not what I expected,"I have naturally curly hair and I need something that will eliminate frizz when i straighten my hair and I thought that this product would help but it doesn't. I get a better ""straight"" from regular gel. I wouldn't recommend this product for someone who has hard to tame/manage hair."
1,Can't wash this stuff out of my hair!!!,"At first I thought the product was great, it did smooth and shine. But after a couple of days I noticed my hair was getting more and more build up and looked greasy and dull. After shampooing it for a week now, two times a shower the stuff is still there. HORRIBLE! Never again. I am going to go buy a clarifying shampoo to see if that gets it out."
3,Didnot work for me as I expected,Mine is frizzy hair. I tried this product thrice before straightening but my hair became very dry and rough. Dont know if the problem is with the conair iron that I use or with this cream.
3,GREAT PRODUCT,"GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING BUT IS NOT WHAT I ORDER, I ORDERED Cationic Hydration CHI Silk Infusion AND THEY SEND ME THIS WITCH I ALREADY HAVE"
4,"Not For Beginners -- Basically An ""Official"" Bootleg","This is not the place for the new Gentle Giant fan to go, but it's a very intriguing portrait of a band in creative dissolution as it succombs to market forces. The ""new wave"" was riding high as Gentle Giant went on the road to support their final studio album, CIVILIAN -- a hard rock album with little of the trademark vocal/instrumental sophistication of their earlier work.This album is basically an ""official"" bootleg as it was recorded off the soundboard. The band plays well, but the sound is not professional quality (but it's ""very good"" bootleg quality).If you've got everything else by GG, then this is a necessary purchase (along with the recently-released BBC archive work). If you're just starting out, you can't go wrong with PLAYING THE FOOL for an excellent sampler (at a great price)."
5,Great read!,"As a United Methodist minister's wife I found this to be a great read.Though obviously many things have changed, some things today are just as they were so long ago,"
4,The boy wonder,These stories are just like you would expect. Robin helping mostly other kids to solve crimes.Batman appears in almost all the storys.Thtese are enjoyable but vastly differant from the comic books of today.
1,"Not even a ""one star"" rating. I wasn't given the option of ""no stars"".",This product was sent from England and it was a complete rip-off. The DVD is not compatible with U.S. systems and will not play. It shouldn't have even been advertised to U.S. buyers. Watch out!
1,DVD,"I ordered a dvd, not realizing it wouldn't play in my dvd player. I live in the U.S., it came from the U.K. ""Wrong Region Disc"" I emailed them, they sent me an email stating that I would have to pay for the shipping, to send it back for my refund. Not a problem, I'm thinking $2.98 (what they charge for shipping). It would cost me almost $10.00 to ship it to get my 8 dollars and change back. I live in Vegas, you'd think they would catch where it is being sent and maybe shoot an email stating that it might not work in your player, because you live in the states. I ordered from someone else (in the U.S.) Will NOT order from them again!!!"
5,Hey Kiss This! hehe :-D,"This is a fun movie for all! I rented it from the public library, and this is definately one of the films I would purchase on DVD or VHS, since I enjoyed it so much!You can especially appreciate it if you live in the Brooklyn/Manhattan area of New York City, because Guidos listening to 103.5 KTU are a pure staple of our local society. :)One thing that's very attractive about this film is a distinct plot conflict between characters, which is eventually resolved at the end of the film, as all characters find that they need and want each other, whether they're the manhating Meryll, the homophobic Frankie, the abused gay lover Warren, or even Pino the player getting in touch with his monogamous side. It wasn't offensive, nor did it insult the viewer's intelligence, as the story kept moving along at a brisk and very interesting pace.Plenty of laughs for all, particularly if you're from this region and see what lunacy goes on around here. :)"
1,too sterotypical,"And I liked it then, but now there is so much more to choose from that is actualy thoughtful, less stereotypical, and better written.I empathized much more with the straight character, who was trying to make the best of a bad situation. The gay character is caddy and snippy and, frankly, not very attractive."
2,Lots of potential but...,"This book was just okay. The storyline is excellent for true crime, but the author's presentation is bland. I had a constant feeling of ""the book is gonna get really good now"", and while it is good, it never drew me in to where I couldn't put it down."
2,I was not pleased with this purchase,I did not know that there are different types of DVDs for different countries. The DVD I received was for a specific region and would not play on our Blue Ray player. I contacted the seller and had to return the movie at my own expense and never received the refund promised. I would not recommend purchasing from this seller.
5,This book helps others understand,"If you have lost a child to a home accident, this book may help you deal with your grief and understand that you are not alone.Carla McClafferty's son Corey had fallen out of a swing at home and ended up dying. She shares her disbelief, the agony of the hospital stay and her anger in God for not answering her prayers to save her child.This is a really emotional book that will bring tears to anyone's eyes. If you know someone who has lost a child and want to help, but don't fully understand the pain of that loss, consider purchasing this book!"
2,La Toya can do better,"The ballad ""Someday"" shows that La Toya vocally can do well. The production is weak. The songs are ok. It's dancey pop."
5,Survival under stress,"Gilkey's academic liberalism is tested by the reality of the stress he observes as a mid-20's, very involved leader under prison conditions. His insights in the complex areas of law, food distribution, justice, work (his insight into lazy workers is very good), equality, theology, among other topics makes this book required reading for all managers, supervisors, teachers, religious leaders and lawyers. His associations with gifted intellects as well as self serving persons during his incarceration allowed him to validate his presuppositions. This is one of the most insightful books I've read in a long time. I now know why he is such an highly respected, revered teacher, mentor and theologian. His insight into the original sin of mankind is worth the price of the book! This book is truly a blessing."
3,Guitars of the World Unite !,"I bought this based on a Goldmine magazine review.The critic seemed to think it was quite the amazing record but I should have been forwarned by his glowing ravings of the bass and drums.What ?Don't get me wrong, there is some good guitar work here - the Brain May and Neil Schon sections stand out.Somehow, old Carmine owed a few favors and let John McEnroe and Steven Seagal play a couple tunes.Actually, the Seagal song isn't bad (it's not clear which guitar he plays)but steer clear of McEnroe's tune.He should have kept to air guitar on the tennis racket.Worth a listen, in a retro sort of 70's kind of way, but nothing special."
3,Misleading description... this is a compilation!,"Though the publishing and copyright of this album is stated as 2006 on the CD's tray card, it actually consists of tracks lifted (as they were) from the 1st and 2nd ""Guitar Zeus"" albums (i.e. ""Guitar Zeus"" and ""Guitar Zeus 2 - Channel Mind Radio"",) released in Japan back in 1995 and 1997 respectively. Please visit the appropriate reviews for details!"
1,Access Code Doesn't work,"I bought this from Amazon because it said it included the access kit. The access code doesn't work, I even talked with Pearson technical support to try and get it to work, and thus makes it useless for me! Waste of money. Very displeased."
3,Don't trust condition description,"If ""very good"" condition means a half dozen ""accordioned"" pages, one torn, numerous page corners folded over and several sticky tabs from the previous owner, then that is what I received. At least there is no writing or missing pages, all information is available. Just annyoying here and there to have to hold down a page to be able to read it."
4,Good for the Price,"The earrings aren't nearly as sparkly as they seem in the picture, but for $20, they are absolutely gorgeous. If you look closely you can see the wire connecting the beads, but from a distance of more than about two feet they look fantastic."
4,Not bad,"Fairly pleased with these. I like the anklet and the bracelet done in this style quite a bit more, but these are not bad at all.I kind of wished the crystals on the string were flexible such that were a person to move their head they would not always stay in a straight line. I mean don't get me wrong... the earrings dangle and will move. They look to all be mounted on a silver rod, which will swing from the top. Maybe this was done for a reason, but I think they'd look nicer mounted on a loose cord. And for all I know I'd complain about the lack of structure and symmetry.Anyway... from a damned picky person, these are quite nice."
3,Disappointed,"The description is misleading - the earrings are much smaller than described. It should state that the leverback is part of the length. If I had known this I would not have purchased them. They're OK, but not great. I would think twice before buying jewelry again."
2,nothing special,in the picture they are very impresive but in reallity nothing to talk about but i live overseas so i cannot return anything so i will be left with themruthi
4,music in high places - india arie (live in brazil),"Always loved India's music. DVD shows more of her ""down to earth"" side and her love of life and people."
3,There are better alternatives for Troggs fans,"This is not original band members and therefor the sounds is not what it should sound like. Instead, try to listen to ""The Troggs - hit single anthology"" Fontana 848 164-2.A fan in Stockholm"
1,Steer clear of this one,"I thought I was buying egg nog. It turned out to be skim milk. The songs are remakes, and the charm of the original songs has been completely lost. I feel burned."
2,the troggs cd,dissapointed. doesn't sound like the original recordingIt actually sounds like a re-recording of someonewho sounds like the original artists.
3,Not enuf for me,I have always wanted to read this book and see the stage play when I was younger....So now I have can't wait to see the movie.
4,For Colored Girls...how will the movie be adapted?,"I enjoyed this book of choreopoems. I am an avid reader of African-American works. This book was especially interesting to me since it will be adapted into a movie in 2011 by Tyler Perry. I wonder how he will adapt a book of poems onto the big screen? I am sure with the dynamo cast and his creative genius it will be short of mind blowing. I wish it could have come out later this year, because a January 2011 release won't make it if it is Oscar worthy? We shall see."
2,What's the point?,Trying to read this book was not a good experience. I understand the message they were trying to get across but it was hard reading. Donated it out.
1,":( I love Michael Moore, but this was not funny","I couldn't even sit through the first episode, it was so bad and I am a huge Michael Moore fan - I have even met him! Maybe I am too young for this to be funny, it is like he is doing stand up in the early 90's, and it is all political stand up, and I did not get most of the jokes. The ones that I did get- were not that funny. I hate to have to leave a bad review, but I want to spare others this purchase."
4,Top Notch,"Moore is not for everyone. He is for the open-minded individual that is not afraid to ask the question 'why'. This was a beautiful series that has made me happy to see on DVD. For those that cannot stand his longer films, this would be the perfect venue to view his topics.Michael Moore's short lived ""TV Nation"" gets a long awaited resurrection and make-over with ""The Awful Truth"" which demonstrates the true power and potential of television. Michael Moore is the documentarian behind ""Roger And Me"" and ""The Big One"" and author of ""Downsize This"".Do yourself a favour, catch this show, have a laugh, and watch an important crusader do what he does best, make slimy corporations very nervous, and improving the world a bit at a time."
1,Very disappointing,"I loved this system after I bought it brand new, out of the original boxes. I used it for a few months until suddenly it stopped working. I loved this thing until it lasted much less than one measly year. That was quite a large expense to not even work. Did not even come with a warranty as far as I can tell. What a waste of hundreds of dollars"
4,405 drawings by Picasso in his 80's,"This is a collection of 405 drawings - mosting pencil, with some ink and wash - done by Picasso in his 80's. The reproductions vary in size, from 1 to about 3 or 4 images per page. Maybe not his best work, but fun to look at, and more evidence of Picasso's life-long energy and imagination."
2,Worked but strong smell,"It retained heat well enough, but had a disturbingly strong smell when heated that I did not experience with other similar products."
1,Arrived with minute hand broken,The minute hand was disconnected from the center piece upon arrival. I shook it around a bit and it would reconnect but only for a few hours. I returned it with no problems. Found Walmart has them for 3 to 4 dollars afterward.
4,Just had to have it!,"I just had to have this little, portable camera. I could just see myself, carrying it around in my pocket everywhere I went. It happened for a while, but I needed more.The camera itself is very small, and hard to hold still. Of course there is no flash, so outdoors is the only place I could get a pic. But I bought mine for $8 or so, when I couldn't afford anything nicer. It's better than nothing! Now, of course, they have cams on phones.It was considered 'cool' by some of the neighborhood kids; and they wanted one. It came with the cable and all. It will even take 10 shots one-after-the-other 'like' a video."
5,amazing what a man can do with a turntable.,"to actually put together a concept album with a storyline, you'd think of releases like ""the wall"" by pink floyd, but not something along the lines of a dj using turntables and mixers. this album is unbelievable. i play this one not daily (i try not to play -anything- daily) but the more i play this, other people are getting turned on to it as well. it's an amazing piece of work, and i wish i had access to the samples that q-bert does. pick this up. you will not be disappointed."
4,"A primer for DJ heads, a classic in it's own right","This is a ridiculously strong album, especially if you've been sampling the diluge of DJ records out right now. Q-bert is not only one of the best scratchers in the world, but his tracks posess a depth that most DJs simply try to fill in by mixing in a fashionable beat. The record has character, class and heart, and is second only as a DJ record to Mix Master Mike's ""Anti-Theft Device"". MMM also helped out on this one, beat-wise, so get it."
5,Tonic is HIGHLY and boy do I mean HIGHLY under-rated,"This CD is simply amazing. I've been listening to this album off and on for the past year and every time I listen to it, it gets better and better. These guys have way more talent than a lot of newer band out there. Tonic makes Nickelback and Puddle of Mudd look like imbeciles. Every song is just great; I can't say anything bad about any song.Highlights: Well every one of them and I'm not just saying that. I can listen to this CD all day on repeat."
5,Underated Excellence(actually 4 1/2 Stars),"I loved Tonic's debut Lemon Parade.Sugar is a excellent follow up.We're talking sweet alternative guitar rock here, with excellent rhythms,melodies and vocals.My only complant is that Sugar lacks the punch of Lemon parade.It's more Pop compared to Lemon Parade being more medium hard rock. Tonic is one of those rare bands where all the music on their Cds is good(to me) and flow together nicely""Knock Down Walls""& ""You Wanted More"" are my favorites from Sugar and have that familiar Tonic sound remnicent of ""If You Could Only See"" From Lemon Parade.The rest of the Cd is of varied degrees of goodness, take your pick."
3,Nothing special here,"These are not alternate versions - these are the original versions with the single's version of WOTS thrown in. If you want to buy it for the cover photograph, fine. Otherwise, save your money and buy the remastered verions of Foxtrot, Nursery Cryme, and Selling England By the Pound. They're well worth buying for the improvement in sound quality alone."
2,WAY TOO OLD,This is high school. Both the Carrie and Tommy characters are way too old for these parts and it shows. In true life the Carrie character (Angela Bettis) who is supposed to be 18 is 29 and Tommy (Tobias Mehler) is 26. Would of been a stretch for college seniors but high school - get real. Some actors can pull it off - Sissy Spacek was about the same age as Angela when she played it - but not these two. If you want to watch Carrie watch the Sissy Spacek version. This one is a poor TV copy cat version.
5,Awesome Adaptation of King's 1st Novel,Loved the '76 movie but this is great also. I like how Carrie's mother is not quite so over the top in this newer version. Angela Bettis was outstanding as Carrie. Definitely recommended!!!!
3,Worth renting.,I enjoyed Angela Bettis as Carrie. Unfortunately her performance alone could not completely save this remake of a classic. I liked certain updates like the internet search and the use of cell phones but the mention of a Freddy Prinze movie was just too much updating. Some of the scenes were over exagerated from the book. The ending was very anti-climatic and slightly drawn out to the point of being... well pointless. Never the less the new special FX really make the Prom night scenes worth the price of renting.
2,A couple of good performances; nothing else to recommend,"Patricia Clarkson is always good, and she is great here as Carrie's religious nut of a mother. Emilie de Ravin (sp?) is good at getting us to hate her character, Carrie's main tormenter.All Angela Bettis does as Carrie is tremble and perspire a lot whenever she's about to do some telekinetic thing, while Kandyse McClure is merely competent.The fireballs that come down on the Whites' house when Carrie is a kid are just goofy and cheesy, not scary at all.Adapted or not, this one just doesn't make it. The Sissy Spacek version is the all-time classic. See that one instead."
1,throwing rotten tomatoes,"This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. The original Carrie is a great movie. The remake of it is laughable at best. I wish I could get that wasted 2 hours and 12 minutes back. Since I can't I will settle for warning those who read this review. It was a pointless remake there was nothing spectacular about the effects and considering the remake is in a different century from the original I expected more but got much, much less. Be warned not worth the time."
2,Perfunctory at Best,This film's production is perfunctory at best. Once more the viewer is confronted with yet another go around of what was not that brilliant of an original film in the first place. One can only sigh.
1,this time they should have left good enough alone and not done a remake,"when you have nothing new to say with a project leave it alone,someone should have told the people involved with this mess that and saved us the trouble of having to set through this mess and waste our time. stick with the de palma version."
2,Horrible!,"After watching all of Tori's music videos on The Complete Videos 1990-1998, I was greatly anticipating this video. What a let down! The whole video she and Adrian Brody are only legs (until the very end). I understand where she was going with this, but I thought it was stupid to have the whole entire video consist of this. It is such a beautiful song and I think the video should have been as spectacular."
1,A BIG disappointment,I am a big Tori Amos fan and was greatly disappointed when I watched this. I paid a dollar for this and I really don't think it was worth it.
3,Received this as a gift,"I fell asleep halfway through it. It is difficult to understand the words. What is Brian? He is not a strong singer nor is he a strong musician. He's still pretty good looking though. There is one REALLY GREAT song in which the piano player let go with classical sounding music, which showed he had training, but it was overridden by the audience's applause. In my opinion, these songs are not good enough to be eternal and they should be laid to rest."
4,The pain principle,"Denton Welch writes directly from his physical being. Moments of epiphany and exaltation are consumed by momentous revulsion. It's a rare encounter, breathing an adjectival power and acute memory, as compelling as it is painful. His life-altering bike accident is related in such a way that the act of writing, the detailed reach of his vocabularly, enacts part of his recovery, the stable point of a dramatically oscillating, and untrustworthy world. An abiding image is that of his despair with his doctor, upon who he seems almost paranoically dependant. When the doctor shifts to another village, semingly out of reach, you can feel the pounding in the pages of Denton's heart."
1,Not for the serious hanky collector,"Doesn't give a lot of info for the serious collector. Author basically shows off her collection that is not that varied, if she is a serious collector. Waste of my money."
4,Mesmerizing,This book held my interest..I didnt want to stop reading it and I loved the setting..You wont be disappointed with this series.
2,POOR NARRATION ON AUDIO VERSION,"Considering Nora Roberts' reputation and clout, you would think she'd insist on only the best as a narrator. To begin with, this is the third book, but the first two were narrated by someone else, so there's no consistency. The narrator of the first two books, David Stuart, was ok, but this person, Guy Lemonier, STINKS! He seems to be merely reading the story out loud. There is no differentiation between characters, making dialogue hard to follow, and considering he's narrating on behalf of a character, Phillip, who is supposedly the son of a doctor, I find it ludicrous that he doesn't know how to pronounce words like Imitrex (a medication). Also, all three books are abridged to the extent that many of the funnier moments are omitted, and all the dialogue with Ray and Stella as ghosts is not included. Don't waste your money on the CD version."
2,A Man With A Blue Chip On His Shoulder,"Self-absorbed and superficial, Richard Polsky travels from coast to coast in search of people to annoy and complain about while trying to come off as a serious art dealer. His big ""insider"" anecdotes are so dull and removed from the art world action of the last two decades that you almost feel sorry for him. But how can you feel sorry for anyone so idiotic that they would take the time to travel to the Jackson Pollock Foundation and sneak into the upstairs private toilet, so he could drop his pants and experience the sensation of sitting on Jackson Pollock's ""personal"" toilet? It's You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again as written by George Costanza."
5,Essential for any woman in business,I have read and own Sheryl Shade's book on table manners and etiquette. I love it. The does and don'ts you won't get at HBS exist in this book and I would advise any woman in business or any parent whose daughter is graduating from business school to read this book and then live by it.You will be surprised at how much more respect and attention you will receive by NOT being one of the boys. Trust me it works.
4,Never to old to learn manners,"I love this book. It is simple to read, understand, and to teach from. I have an 11 year old Grandchild who is learning with me, the meaning of being a lady that is followed up with action.From how to eat with what fork or spoon to what to do with the napkin when you are finished eating.This is a great book for young and old to learn what you might not have been taught."
2,Bodybuilding History Video,"If you like female bodybuilding, you can't miss this video. You will experience the beginning of this sport, its most important competition -- The Ms Olympia -- and the formers females competitors who had the courage to break the ""rules"". It is an important documentary, in bodybuilding history."
4,"Dark, Sultry Beauty","Anita Lane was Nick Cave's muse from when he was still at school until the heady early days of the Bad Seeds. She co-wrote Her To Eternity and Kindness of Strangers, amongst others.This collection of her (all too few) recordings until 1995 is full of seduction, dark fairy lands, and a guilty, innocent girl who enchants with her beauty and her voice. The album is diverse, from a sultry cover of 'Sexual Healing' to Birthday Party backed postpunk 'Fullness of His Coming'. Binding it together is persistent strangeness.The highlight tracks are the spookily poetic 'Blume' and 'Subterrenean World', and the upbeat disco cover 'Lost In Music'.Anita is underrated and underknown. If you can find a copy of Dirty Pearl, get it.'For you I will be a sunflower/ Do you hear my enlightening laughter?/ Another reason to cut off an ear/' (Blume)"
3,ok phone,"Just got it and have started using it, so far so good. I got it mainly for the FHSS, but the battery in the handset seems kind of weak already... Sound on regular talk is good, speakerphone volume is weak. Ok for the money."
3,Interesting at times but nothing new,I am interested in organizational change and found the title interesting but talk of Generative Leaders and Historical approaches seems to me like putting new words on old methods. The idea of the conversations is like brainstorming in the past so was disappointed in the end product
3,A different sound from a charismatic star,"Ricky Nelson had the benefit of the first music videos on television, performed on the Ozzie and Harriet program, and as a result is often underrated by music 'experts', but the fact is that Rick Nelson was a major figure in popular music. He was very good, and unique, completely apart from several 'clones' turned out by the industry.There are 2 discs in this set, 'greatest hits' and 'in concert', many performed in small clubs and venues. These are unpolished and not pure classic renditions of his songs, but they somehow give you a feel about Rick Nelson as a human being and not a plastic image."
4,Dark and Strange,"Claymation animator Will Vinton's first -- and to date, only -- full-length feature is based on Mark Twain's lesser-known writings, including ""Tom Sawyer Abroad"" and ""The Mysterious Stranger."" (It also owes a substantial debt to Justin Kaplan's critical biography ""Mr. Clemons and Mark Twain."") The storyline is episodic and incoherent, but individual scenes -- especially the ""Mysterious Stranger"" sequence -- are as good as animation gets.Vinton's ""Adventures of Mark Twain"" is probably too strange for most audiences, and its nightmarish imagery is not suitable for young children. Twain buffs, however, will be delighted."
3,rad,This is a good claymation video. I got it because my son loved the Velveteen Rabbit. He liked that one much more.
4,"Very good, easy to use, great general Asian source.","Charmaine Solomon is the best author of Asian cookbooks I've read and this is a great book - the Burmese and Malaysian recipes are great.In most sections I found the text informative and concise. However some of the instructions do assume some familiarity with wok/Asian cooking, just enough to make you think. That said, none of the recipies I've tried have fallen flat.For a great cookbook, have a look at her Thai only book - very clearly explained, great glossary, best Thai book out ther"
5,Huge & complete cookbook!,"WOW! If you are looking for a cookbook that has every Asian recipe you can imagine, this is it. It covers recipes from India to Japan. Some easy and some advanced. It's a big book and holds lots of great recipes. Not so sure this is a book for the beginner cook? as most of the recipes are very detailed and time consuming. Either way, a great addition to the cooks cookbook library!"
4,Does a good job,"This thing is easy to use and does its job without fuss. The handle has very good grip. Overall, I like the product."
2,"If one bulb fails, they all go out","I bought 4 strings of these lights last year. When a bulb burns out, the rest of that string goes out. Then you must check each of the 10 bulbs to find the one that burned out. It is very annoying and you soon run out of spare bulbs. This poor design has not been used in most outdoor lights for decades. Did Bealls get snookered by their Chinese supplier or did they just get a price that was too low to pass up?"
5,Wilton Recipe Right 6 Cup Regular Muffin Pan,"I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. I'm sure she will use it a lot since she likes to make cupcakes, and only had one pan. . She is only 15 years old and discovered the fun of baking."
2,Child's table and Chairs,"The experience I had with this item, table & chairs, turned out to be a nightmare."
4,A Saturday read to lose yourself in,"Sherry artfully brings to life the story of a young girl who is facing trials that no woman should ever have to face. Shadows of the Past is a journey into the power of self-reliance and learning to overcome. Wonderfully written and inspiring, this is a must read for everyone!"
2,extra buttons DO NOT WORK on Vista,"I love the ergonomics of this mouse. Too bad that Kensington is falsely marketing it as a ""5 programmable button"" mouse. The software included with the product explictly states that it does not support Vista.How can this be? Vista shipped almost three years ago. It's really hard to believe that Kensington still does not support the most commonly used operating system. I guess they don't really care about their customers.Their software does claim to work on XP and Mac OSX, but if you're on Vista be warned."
4,A Moving War Drama!,"This unique war drama is a little too Hollywoodized, but that doesn't diminish the emotional impact and poignancy of the film that has remains untouched after all these years. Greer Garson gives her best performance as the strong Mrs. Miniver. Walter Pidgeon and Teresa Wright are also great in support. This was one of the first films to look at war from another point of view, how the women left behind, mothers and wives, had to deal with the thought of their sons and husbands not coming back home. Filled with many memorable vignettes; the scene where Mrs. Miniver has to deal with a young German soldier, the flower show, and the last speech in the church is extremely poignant. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"
3,Too short,I was disappointed in the length of this practice. The poses are pretty ordinary. I use this one on days that I am feeling like I want to get a practice in but don't want to work too hard.
3,"Good, but a duplicate","These are quite good yoga routines, but they are the same two that appear on the ""Slim Physique"" (aka ""Sleek Physique"") DVD. That title also has a series of aerobic and strength workouts and has been one of my favorites for over five years. If you can find it, I recommend getting that DVD - more workout for your dollar!Karen Voight - Slim Physique"
4,The anti- IPOD.,"This is the second Sandisk Sansa e280 that I have purchased. Obviously I liked the first one enough to buy another one, this one for my wife. Her I-pod shuffle battery died after limited use and while my Sansa player was going strong after 1.5 years of use. We use them while excersizing, so I wanted a ram based player. It is a great little music player, and that's all I use it for. Start up was uncomplicated, plug it into the usb port, charge it up and it was ready to go. The software is easy to use. Once you have music on your computer you can drag and drop, or copy and paste, to load the unit with music. The earbuds it comes with are just okay, add a better set of headphones and the quality of the music is great. It holds plenty of music, even at lossless quality levels. We don't all have to have I-pods!"
5,Sandis is Great,I bought a Sandisk a few weeks ago and think it is a great product! The replacable battery last forever and the music is pretty good quality. I turn the Sandisk volume to full and transmit over my FM transmitter to my car radio and it is pretty good quality. It is somewhat limited by the quality of my car stereo but it seems pretty good. I like the format for choices in the player. I did use the FM recorder and it too was great. I would recommend it to any one interested in an MP3 player. My only complaint is they didn't send a cd to download the software and with dial-up it took 5 hours to download the picture software and it didn't work after downloading. If you have faster internet it probably wouldn't be a problem.
5,Quality mp3 player with user e.q..,"Bought Sansa's 4 gig model at Walmart, and love it, but am taking it back as I found an 8 gig model at Amazon for a few dollars more....own 4 ipods. Ipods are great, with room for improvement...the company is a reality wake-up call for hard-core capitalism...THEY SUCK!!I've heard good things about the sansa support...everything working great, so far.(in responce to why sansa over ipod)1. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE ABSURDLY EASY TO SCRATCH IPOD WINDOW, THAT THESE JERKS COULD HAVE REPLACED BY NOW (SANSA DOESN'T EVEN NEED A CASE..IT'S NOT SCRATCHING(WITH PROPER CARE)2. THE USER E.Q. ON THE SANSA IS WHAT PUTS IT FAR ABOVE THE IPODS, FOR ME. IT REALLY WORKS AND I HEAR THINGS NEVER HEARD BEFORE IN MY SONGS."
1,Note system requirements,"This Sansa requires Windows XP - it doesn't work with the Windows 2000 operating system. And if you want to use it with Rhapsody to go you should buy the special e280 Rhapsody or e280R version which Amazon doesn't seem to carry. You can find it at Best Buy, though. I'm returning this one."
1,Spend the extra money and get an IPOD NANO,"Im currently waiting for my THIRD Sansa e280. The first one never worked correctly, retuned it to SanDisk, got a new one which worked great for about a month and then froze and could not be reset. Waiting on yet another new player to be sent to me. Hopefully the third one is a charm. Don't have any experience with the Nano, but it has to be better than this."
1,"Kept breaking, firmware upgrades didn't help",Had to send it back to Sansa for a replacement - still waiting. This is business day 10. They said 8 - 10 days.
2,So far... not so good.,"So far... not so good. Bought 4g for my wife and it worked very well. Bought 8g for myself to replace a 4g m-series I had and suffice to say, I've had troubles. First It appears from the packaging that I got a refurbished model. An instruction booklet that appeared to be photocopied and no advanced instruction disc as my wife had in hers.I don't recall reading anything in fine print that said this was refurbished. Don't know if this is an Amazon problem or Sansa problem. Secondly and most importantly, After I initially added my playlists, now when I add a new one...I loose 2 or 3, the Go list pops up in the place of the missing playlist...very frustrating."
5,A great mp3 player,"this is a great mp3 player> i suggest if you get this to look for Rockbox software to load onto it, this will give you the ability to play just about any media natively."
1,NOT mac compatible,"I knew the sync software wouldn't work on a mac, but i had expected to be able to drag-n-drop my music and video onto it in data mode. But this won't show up at all, not even as a drive or storage device.Probably works great, but if you have a mac, it doesn't work at all so i had to return it."
3,none,I am unable to load any music because my PC does not recognize the unit.I have not been able to find any install softwear.Ther for I am unable to use the unit.
3,SanDisk Sansa e280,"This was the second SanDisk I puchased - one for use for home/gym and the other for work. I really liked the first SanDisk I purchased, so I purchased a second. However, it appears that the second player did not have all of the features of the first player e.g. I cannot delete a song from the player, I have to use the computer. Also, using the play list on the second player is not as user friendly as the first player - just little quirks - I had expected the same features on both."
2,no support from sansa for the e280v2,it realy low price for retail $119.00 8g space can hold up to 1000 songs and had photo the only problem his that it doesn't come with a cd instalation for media converter i contact techsupport they weren't that help full finding solutionthey only said that i need to talk to the retailer. oush then why it in the mark it without support.. the e280 was reading with less gb and a diffrent model and no cd instalation. oush then why is in the mark it without support. i switch to sansa e260 it work fabulos and supported it comes with a instalation to tranfer videos and photos.
4,Very good item at the price!,"I like the design, color, screen wide. So I would say it 's worth to enjoy it."
4,"Great mp3 player, Toss out the headphones.","For some reason, most audio players come with really cheap headphones. FM radio reception is poor indoors. Screen is very bright, but not really big enough for video. It does play both audio and video, but you are better off buying something else for movies. This is a very small player. (You should be able to fit this in your pocket.) 8 GB memory should be enough for mp3's. The type of memory used here is superior to a hard drive (with the notable exception of capacity).This does what I bought it for (plays my mp3s with excellent sound quality). If you really need better sound quality than this, you would need lossless music. In which case, you are better off with real stereo equipment, not a portable."
4,"Sold my iPod, Bought this, Love It","Here are the pros and cons of this player:Pros+ works with Rhapsody subscription service (iPod doesn't) --- huge improvement over the time it takes to download ""free"" tunes from Limewire, etc ...+ awesome battery life -- can't believe I put up with the weak battery on my nano+ lightweight, easy to handle, great screen+ includes FM radio+ price is well worth it compared to ipodCons- flywheel / user interface not as smooth as iPod, but still goodI'll try to update this review as I continue to work with this device but overall, I'm a fan, especially when it's paired with a subscription music service. no idea why apple doesn't have a subscription service, but they just lost a customer here."
