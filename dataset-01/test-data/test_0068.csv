2,Stick with the original,"Please save your money by buying the original Harvest Moon at half price. It is very nearly the same game--same townspeople, same conversations, same animals, same farm. If you remember the original, the girl has to choose from a few of the eligible batchelors (Gustafa, Marlin, or Rocky)--they didn't even add potential mates for her!I don't know why Another Wonderful Life came out so long after the original because they basically kept the format, changed the boy to a girl, made a few subtle changes, and marked it for sale.If you're a huge fan and want to check out the new version--rent it. Keep the old one and start over if you feel like playing the game again. Hopefully, I save you the $30 I wasted."
4,A thumping good read - I couldn't put it down!,"I read this book a few years ago, when living in the United Kingdom, and wanted to recommend this book to my Book Club in the USA for our next discussion. What a disappointment to find it is out of print, as this is one of the most readable and insightful autobiographies I have read! Dear Amazon team, please campaign for it to be reissued!"
3,Toolbooth flirts with doldrums and lassitude,"For young readers and mature who relish words, and for young people just coming to deal with a more responsible world than some versions of childhood suggest, this book is a map of some of the negative feeling states we must endure. Juster unfortunately lapses into the very pedantry that he decries. This dulls the sharpness of the story. But a boy seeking his way might find this map very affirming that they aren't the only person who feels out of it at times, and it give some creative tips and perspectives for coping."
4,"The Phantom Tollbooth: A good book, but it could've been a little better.","""The Phantom Tollbooth"" is an old, but interesting book. It all starts out when Milo, a boy who doesn't know what to do with himself -not just sometimes, always!- comes home from school to find a box with a cardboard tollbooth in it.When he drives through the tollbooth in his electric toy car, he finds himself in the Kingdom of Wisdom, a place where everything is a play on words! For example, Tock, the watchdog, actually has a watch on his chest! In their ultimate quest to find Rhyme and Reason, Milo, Tock, and the Humbug have many queer adventures.I would reccomend this book, but it is not one of my five top favorite. ""The Phantom Tollboth"" uses a lot of great descriptions, but yet, sometimes you might wish the book had a little more of something. This is definately not a book to miss, even though it's personally not my favorite one."
2,The Adventure,The Phantom Tollbooth was very interesting it wasn't how I thought it would be it was much more exciting their is no words to put it in.
3,OK,The book Phantom Toolbooth was oaky. It was very confusing at some parts. You may like because it's nonsense but that's the reason I don't like it!! If you like Alice in wonder land you'll probably like this book.
4,Great for kids and for kids-at-heart,"Next to Harry Potter, this was my favorite book as a child. Super fun read, and I love all the clever wordplay!"
4,Very good,This book was very good I liked it alot. It is about a boy named Milo. He gets a tollbooth one day and it starts an advinture. Milo has to go to alldifferent lands. and ends up doing the right thing.K.A.C
5,Still one of my favorites!,"I've always had a copy of the Phantom Tollbooth around, starting with my very worn Arrow Book Club copy, and continuing with the hardcover my wife gave me for our anniversary. It is a book that continues to teach lessons about the world and how we interact with it, and encourages each of us to see the world through new eyes. A truly wonderful book!"
3,Don't listen to them! Math is fun!,"Overall it was fun, light, enjoyable story - especially groaning at all of those puns. I did feel the math side was a little badly treated - the author made it more difficult and confusing than the English side, but that could be the engineer bias in me. I hate it when people make math sound hard because, well, I like math.I'm not so sure how well any kid would actually learn the lessons that they're trying to instill in this story, maybe it depends on their age (I'm no expert on kids). But it seemed a lot of the puns were a little convoluted, a little reaching, for younger children to understand. And the plot was probably a little young for older children to really enjoy."
5,Great Book,I think the The Phantom Tollbooth is great book because in a way it is informational.It is somthing you can read in your spear time
4,"A wonderful, humorous classic","When I was a child, I loved the Phantom Tollbooth. I still enjoy it--Norton Juster broke the mold with his funny, imaginative, clever, instructive book--but as an adult I find the plot a little tedious and the relationships between characters rather superficial. I've found a book that reminds me of the Phantom Tollbooth, but is even better. It has all the strengths of the PT, but also has more intricate plotting and a more developed relationship between the main characters. If you like PT, you'll love Engraved in Stone."
4,A Great Book,It was a great book because a boy named Milo has a adventure discovering a new world. He finds a dog named the Watch Dog and he makes friends with him. He is wanting to go to Dictionopolis. Travels in a little electric car. He has to go to other cities to get to Dictionopolis. He meets other people and learns some stories.
2,Doesn&#65533;t hold up,"I forget how old I was when I first read this book, but I was (I hope) very young. It was a great favourite of mine. On a recent re-reading it was a correspondingly great disappointment. The land Milo travels to would have been no worse as allegory if it had had depth or flavour in its own right; but it didn't. Nor did Juster employ the wit needed to make the dialogue and the puns carry the story by themselves. Worst of all, it's allegory with no real point. What is the author saying? ""Mathematics isn't so dull as all that, kids; and look: here's a funny drawing!"" The fact that children can't detect the condescension (I couldn't) doesn't mean it isn't there.Sigh. Another illusion shattered. Years ago I would have given this a rave review - but I would have been wrong."
4,Are words your favorite toys?,"Ever wonder what it would be like if things were the way we described them? What if a watchdog was a dog whose body was a clock? What if every time you jumped to conclusions you were hurled miles away to an island named Conclusions? The Phantom Tollbooth is a portal to a world where words become real, in the most real sense of the word! If you believe words are delightful playthings, or if you need to escape into a world of ""what if..."" this book is for you."
5,Fantastic Book,"Reviewed by my 5th grade daughter:I had to read this book for a fifth grade project. Every day we read a little bit more, and every day when I came home, I told my Mom how much fun I was having reading it and what a great book it was. So, at the next book fair our school had, I bought the book for our whole family.The book was hilarious and was just way interesting."
5,One of the best children's classics,"In the late 60's my aunt, who was a librarian at the time, gave me the copy of The Phantom Tollbooth that I passed on to my daughter when she was 7 years old...in 1992. She adored that book, and it was read several times, just as I did. She called me, this afternoon, and asked if I could find a new copy for her, as she had lost the original. She wants to share it with some of her friends, as they have never read the story. Even though they are all in their early 20's now, she feels that it is a story that will be meaningful to them. At the same time, I'm going to get a copy for our nephew as he is 11, and has never heard of the story. It is amazing that it is a ""hidden treasure"" for so many."
5,The Phantom Toolbooth: THE TRUTH,"Norton Jester was a fantasy genius with his book ""The Phantom Tollbooth"", you feel as if you are traveling in the book on the adventures with Milo, Tock, and Humbug. Such as the trip to both Digitoplos and Dictionopolis. We highly recommend this book for ages 8-100! It's a book about friendship, courage, and action! Enjoy!"
1,Wasn't what I needed,When I order this product I realized that it needed speakers so I had to order something else in place of it. Amazon is a good place to buy any kind of product and I will be doing more business in the near future.Thanks Amazon!
4,Heartbreakingly realistic prisoner of war story,The debriefing and psychological evaluation of returning prisoners of warseems entirely lacking in the Danish army.A Danish major is held prisoner for months in near isolation andmade to do things he has trouble living with.The resulting disaster when he is turned loose on his unsuspecting familyis heartbreaking.The acting is very good and the script nails the return of the dead angle.Those who are easy to disturb or get too emotionally involved in a plotshouldn't see this film.
4,Parrot Heads in Paradise,"Fans of Jimmy's music will love this one. He's always been more story teller than musician, and this book proves it. Pour yourself something cold to drink and prepare to cool your heels in Margaritaville."
3,Curse of the Storyteller,"Jimmy Buffett is a fantastic storyteller. That is the best, and the worst, thing about A SALTY PIECE OF LAND.This is the ""Cowboy in the Jungle"" expat story that Jimmy has been singing about for years. Tully Mars takes his pony to the Gulf of Mexico, meets various bizarre characters, and has a wacky adventure.Only there is no ""adventure"", per se, just a series of pretty funny stories strung together by random coincidence. I mean, I know this is JB, and that he really isn't required to have things like a plot and charactiization in his novel,but he's a good enough writer that he could have taken the time, or a decent enough editor could have made him (which may be the problem -- he's had #1 best-sellers on the fiction and non-fiction sides,so what editor can tell him anything anymore?)."
2,The B Side,A lesser effort. A good story teller here lacks a good story. This one will put you to sleep on the beach.
3,good first attempt at fiction,"Good informational fiction on Mideast politics and an allegorical memoir of the current Bush/Rumsfield/Cheney troika. Saudi Arabia is overthrown by a regime unfriendly toward the United States, and the administration is itching for a fight. While rattling sabers at the new Saudi Arabia (Islamyah), the White House falls asleep at the wheel while Iran conspires to build a greater Persia Shi'a coalition. Sound familiar?Richard Clarke's first foray into fiction is a good first attempt, in the Tom Clancy mold post cold-war, where the threats that exists are not nations but cells of radicals. His dialogue is a little wooden and contrived, but still it's definitely a good start. I look forward to his future books"
3,plausible?,"I am in the middle of the book now and having some trouble keeping the characters separate and identified. Too many individuals, good story, poor lead-ins to keep the flow of identities clear. No doubt about the topical interest but it starts to ramble and then interest is gone again."
3,A useful work on a genuinely forgotten area of the war,"The main value of this tome to the general reader is most likely to be the early chapters before the war. This outlines most clearly the nature (arrogance and decadence?) of the British presence in Malaya & Burma. The forgotten armies of the conflict are dealt with very methodically, but this makes for drier reading."
5,great info,we bought this book for my uncle who is an avid car guy and he loved it. he found a lot of great info in the book.
2,Not good,"So much more that they could have done with the ""spaceship"" and they end it with a really really cheesy scene. Not only that, but it got off to a pretty slow start to begin with."
4,Delightfully Disneyesque!,"This film may have had nothing to do with Walt Disney studios, but every aspect of its production hearkens back to ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" I watched so faithfully back in the 1960's. And yet, it doesn't feel dated. One might call it a children's sci-fi ""coming of age"" movie."" The alien kids' infatuation with old pop-culture TV may have been anti-climactic, but its timeless view of youthful innocence strikes a chord with many of us."
4,80's fun movie,"A good movie, cute, fun, corney, very 80's. I think the target audience for this movie would range from 5 to 13 years old but will still be fun for parents. The scene with beer may put off some parents, but it's brief, and kids will understand that it was wrong for the boys in the movie to have the beer if it's explained to them. When I was a kid, me and my friends acted out the creation of the spaceship for weeks and this ""social huckup"" was never mentioned. I especially remembered the fantastic scene where the alien was singing a recording of ""All Around the World"" by Little Richard. A fun side note, the actor that played the male alien ""Wak"" is the same actor that played the ""Star Killer"" character in the drive-in movie scene."
2,"TENDENTIOUS MISINFORMATIONUNTRUTHFUL AND MISLEADING, ABOUNDS WITH",Very selective and biased . I wouldn't call encyclopedia. Almost all entries ARE polically tainted and unre[able. This is a misencyclopedia.
5,Bonjour 8 Cup French Press Replacement Glass Carafe,No problems. It is exactly what it said it was... Need not say anything else.
4,Fine replacement for original equipment,"I bought this because the Bodum carafes are SO fragile, they break from a mere glance in their direction. The fit in the Bodum wire cage is perfect. I wash the new one by hand, and am careful to let the water cool to below boiling prior to pouring into the carafe. So far so good for the BonJour product, but I bought 2 just in case."
3,A LITTLE TIGHT FOR A BODUM,This carafe does not fit exactly in the Bodum 8 cup holder i have but it works well enough to be fine and is less expensive than the Bodum replacement. the press and strainer fit well enough to make good coffee.
1,Broke again,"This time it was just two months past purchase. Going with stainless steel press - costly, but will never break. I guess will be cheaper in the long run considering will never need to replace broken press."
5,Music buffs will love this book!,"This book tells the behind the scenes stories of some of your favorite music from the 40s to the 70s. Whether your favorite music is rock, soul, pop, or jazz--it'a all here. There are also some amazing photographs of the studios and the legendary artist who performed the music. And what's really cool is the list of essential recordings from each of the studios featured in the book. After reading the book, you want to listen to all those tracks again armed with new insight about how they came to be. Great stuff."
3,1 of 4- Broken after three months,I bought four of these as I wanted the extra protection that this type of smoke alarm offered. Unfortunately after three months one keeps going off for no perceptible reason.I just called Kidde - explained my situation and they are shipping out a new unit - no charge. That's great service.
4,Good but not so good,"This dual sensor smoke detector, the Kidde PI9000 battery operated, is a basic, easy to install, sensor whose alarm, hopefully, will never need to be used. The so-called ""deal"" on Amazon was not such a good deal, however. These type of smoke detectors have a useful life-span of 10 years. The unit I received was already over 2 years old (the date is not visible until you open the plastic packaging). So I received only 80% of what I actually was supposed to have purchased. I've noticed other items that are having this age problem, and am becoming very wary of Amazon."
1,Do NOT Buy this!!!,"Two out of Three Alarm failed within Two years and No help from Customer Service. They are not consumer friendly, and warranty for 10 years means nothing because it is hard to connect with the company. And their warranty provision is also not approachable. It is better to buy new one than try to go through warranty process. I do not recommend this Alarm at all."
1,Lasted One Month and Took a Dump,"Good thing there was no fire! Because if there was we would of never known. I use one of these in my garage. It worked good with testing for the first few weeks. We light matches to test and also push the button. After one month, now it will only make a ticking (very faint) beep sound. Regardless of batteries. I was skeptical to buy. But you get what you paid for!You HAVE TO test these smoke alarms on a regular bases. I bet you these 5 star people don't test them."
1,Feel-Good NWO Disinformation,"Flawed science, flawed logic, with the goal of steering you to a full line of Horowitz products to ""fix"" all of you NWO created problems. Horowitz is a gifted speaker, obviously quite intelligent, but there are significantly large scientific errors that I cannot imagine are just simple mistakes.He says over and over sound is an electromagnetic frequency.Electromagnetic frequencies can travel through space and require no atmosphere to travel. Reflect back on your middle school education that informed you that sound requires an atmosphere to travel. He's a skillful deceiver convincing the public of scientific deceptions that contradict what they have all already been taught as children.There are other problems with his works, but this should be a clear enough example of the audacity of some of this guys claims. Remember disinformation typically consist of 95% fact with 5% deception, so don't get lost in the mix!"
5,surge protector,This item was as described and was of good quality. I would recomend it to anyone for there own personal use.
2,Poor Design,"Poor design. Installation requires removing outlet cover plate, but the product when installed doesn't cover outlet box leaving a ugly hole in wall showing."
1,Doesn't cover sheetrock opening!!,Yikes! I can't believe someone hasn't mentioned this yet. When you remove the wall plate and replace it with this unit...it mounts too low over the existing outlet and doesn't cover the unfinished sheetrock on the top edge of the original outlet. You would think that this unit is so much larger than the existing 2-plug wall plate that it wouldn't be an issue. The problem is that this unit mounts so low over the original plate that it doesn't cover the hole in the sheetrock.
5,Excellent job!!,"This was an excellent job of showing how through all of the racial differences and confrontations there wwa still a person, in MS, with power trying to change things for the better of man kind. A great book for anyone to read. Dr. Mitchell did an wonderful job of showing this man without beings biased due to there friendship. Great work!!"
2,Real period piece,"Frank Smith from the Mississippi Delta has to be one of the more unusual Mississippi politicians. His liberal philosiphy as a Congressman in the 50's put him slightly to the left of mainstream America, but on another planet from his fellow Mississippians at the time. Such a person makes an excellent subject of a biography. Smith was definitely a major player during memorable times in Mississippi.I didn't finish the book. At about the half way point I became overwhelmed with the author's unstinting effort to compile in excruciating chronological order everything and everybody who entered into Smith's carrer. The book is excellent as a kind of ""book of record"" of what was happenning in Mississippi at the time, both the good things and the many bad things. However, it isn't a very enjoyable read."
2,"""Hardcover"" fooled me","I've enjoyed Citizen since I was a kid, and I ordered this because it's very rare to see Heinlein's works in hardback. In fact, I have about 30 Heinlein books, and only one in hardback (well, 2 now). BUT, this edition is essentially the normal paperback with a different cover; it's the same size as the paperback and the same pulpy paper (and the type goes too close to the binding). If you're buying this just to replace your paperback version, it's probably not worth it.Update: Amazon has now changed the description from ""Hardcover"" to ""Library Binding"""
5,Favorite of all,"Heinlein is one of my favourite authors, and I would certainly recommend this book to any one first reading him. It was a book I read as a teen-ager, re-read as a young adult and read again as I got older. It does what many of Heinlein's books do for you - they tansfer you to another place full of rich tapestries, worlds and people. You root for the character, feel sad for him and wish the best for him. After you read enough of his works, you see and hear many things that come from other books. Can be read alone, but serves as treats for loyal readers. Gret book by a great author."
3,Good but software does not work on Macs,"I bought the Belkin UPS 800VA to replace an old APC 300VA unit. Overall I like the Belkin design. The 6 outlets at the back are well spaced and there is a surge protector for your telephone line. The unit sits unobtrusively under my desk.Only the PC version of the Bulldog UPS software is included in the box. I had to download the latest Mac version from the Belkin website. The Mac Bulldog v3.0.3 software nearly works and I have reported its critical bug to Belkin.Since this unit is line-interactive (it is constantly monitoring voltage) its inverter is always running. As a result, there is a bearly noticable 60Hz hum for the unit. The hum did not exist with my APC 300VA, but then, it did not provide any voltage regulation. The hum was pretty bad until I realized the UPS unit was vibrating my furniture! I stuck self-adhesive felt pads to its feet to isolate the UPS and now it sits quietly, humming to itself and not very loudly."
2,That don't impress me much...,"In the immortal words of Shania Twain- ""that don't impress me much"". I first read Clarke's ""2001"" when I was maybe 12 years old and it just blew me away. I read that book many times. However, I never was motivated to read any other Clarke books. Recently I stumbled upon an Amazon ""end of the world"" book list and saw ""Childhood's End"" (CE) on the list (along with classics like ""Earth Abides"", ""Alas, Babylon"", etc.). Anyhoo, I read CE and was quite moved. It was pretty awesome- the scope and the ideas. So then I moved on to ""Rendezvous with Rama"". All I can say about this one is that I felt none of the emotions that I experienced with CE. This is just a nuts and bolts story. There's really not anything in here that awes/terrifies/humbles me.If you like this kind of stuff, I suggest you read Frank Tipler's ""The Physics of Immortality"". That book has some ideas that will REALLY boggle your mind."
3,"Well written and discriptive, except...","I thought that the engineering and imagery that Arthur C. Clarke describes of the alien ship was very well done. I found it easy to picture the ship. However, I didn't find the book very exciting. If you are looking for a fast paced book with a terrific ending I wouldn't suggest this one."
5,Wonderful!,There really isn't a better way to describe this book except for wonderful! I loved every single part of it and it was a great follow up to the first book. Willig's use of interesting historical detail mixed with humour and wit makes this book hard to put down. The characters are charming (both the old and the new) and the plot is full of little twists that keep it from getting dull. I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading a tale that warms the heart & lightens the spirit. Can't wait for the next one to come out!
4,Great Fun!,"Lauren Willig has done it again. If you enjoyed the Secret History of the Pink Carnation this book picks up where that one left off. I really enjoy her two stories in one style, and her characters are intelligent and witty. For a good chuckle and a light read this novel is a must! I'm looking forward to her next novel, The Deception of the Emerald Ring."
2,A great waste!,"Because of the author's academic credentials, I expected a really substantive ""historical mystery.""Instead, it's a coy, saccharine Harlequin romance.Rather revolting, actually."
4,Excellent Resource!,"All of Writer's Digest resource books are excellent. If you think about it, where else would this vital industry contact information be available? I'm getting irritated with ""Quack's"" comments on every Writer's Digest review page. He obviously never sent a query or manuscript to an agent (as he probably can't write one to begin with) because I've had a lot of luck sending queries, proposals, and manuscripts to agents and publishers who ""say"" they aren't accepting new authors, etc. I have one book deal in the works because I sent my proposal to a publisher who clearly stated, ""No new authors."" So Quack needs to get a life, learn how to write, and stop being such a kill joy. He'll never be a successful writer...or a successful anything. He's just too pessimistic. If you're serious about writing, you need all of the contacts and resources you can get. This book will get you started on the right path."
1,This toy is junk,"This toy is junk! It does not work as advertised, it has sharpe edges on it that could hurt a child. It is another China junk toy. If you are looking for a toy gun for your child don't buy this one. I returned the toy gun and got my money back!DJ"
3,My favorite book,"I think this book is good and easy to read. It is suitable for learners of English. This story show the problems , which may be occur , if you do not say the truth. The story makes me follow it till the end. Importantly, it make me realise that we must tell nothing but the truth. This is a wonderful story and I think everyone will enjoy it!"
2,Not as in-depth as I hoped,"I bought this book hoping to cull some ideas for an idea I have for a box with inlay. However, this book is just straight ahead projects. The book does cover other things, like hand made dove tail joints, and making wood inlay - but they weren't as in-depth as I was hoping. If you have a shop full of various power tools and chisels and saws, etc - this book is for you. If you're looking for ideas on box designs/construction, and have a limited set of tools - I wouldn't recommend this one."
5,Appliance Protection,I decided to buy this to protect my refrigerator after reading some of the customer reviews. (Thanks to J. Leo for the idea)People often forget that a fridge needs surge protection just like their electronic devices because they can cost as much or more than a PC.
5,Inexpensive electronic insurance,"This device is rated for 880 joules of energy which I was very surprised at such a high rating for such a low price. In addition it comes with Belkin's connected device warranty coverage as well. I have used the charger as a surge protector but the unit is rather bulky and you'll need to plug it into the lower outlet if you want to have access to both outlets. As I said it is a bit bulky but the reason for that is because of the high joule rating and required internals to achieve that high level of protection. At the price they go for, it amazing they are this cheap, when consider other surge protector offer less protection cost more"
5,works,This thing is awesome. I am so relieved to have my expensive devices connected through this as I can always see they protected with the green lights on the device.
4,Great product doesn't fit,"This would be an excellent product but because of the type of tv bracket I have it doesn't fit. So it is pretty much useless, which was a waste of money, not the products fault but it could warn people about not working with wall hanging tvs."
4,Works as advertised,"I can't get too excited about wax but this stuff works fine, easy to apply and gives a nice finish."
5,A truly haunting read!,"One of the most frightening books I have ever read! Herbert's best, unparalleled by any he has written before or since. The movie was a poor imitation - read the book. It will stay with you long after you are done."
5,this book is essential to the study of Louis-Philippe,"Louis-Philippe writes about his journey through the United States. He notes the changes in how people lived while traveling from Philadelphia to Bardstown, Kentucky. His descriptions of the cities and the rural areas provide the reader with a rich description of what it was like to travel through the wilderness in 1797. There is an exquisite description of his visit to George Washington at Mount Vernon. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in early United States history."
3,I'm glad there's a book out there on this topic!,"Too often it's assumed that all environmentalists are white, class-privileged neo-hippies and that people of color are too busy with ""real"" issues. This book shows that activists of color are extremely dedicated to fighting pollutants in their community. This book stresses that a disproportionate number of communities of color have been targeted for toxic wastes sites, etc.; so it is not environmental classism, but specifically environmental racism. This book does a good job in showing how Blacks, Native Americans, and Latinos are equally engaged in fighting this tragedy. This book may be too simplistic for longtime activists. For non-scientists like myself, many of the chemical compounds mentioned and stuff like that went right over my head (figuratively, of course). Still, this helped me learn more on the topic and is a good starter book. I think this book can help bring progressives across color lines together."
1,Does Not Work with XP,Supposed to install automatically with XP SP1. Does not. CD drivers not useable either. Do not buy this piece of crap.
5,Snowboard helmet,"Great price, just right for 11-12 years old boy - fashionable, and came with tons of stickers."
4,"Well actually 4.5 stars, but whatever","Great album, it doesn't really sound much like ""The Kinks"" either, which is a good thing. Ray is doing something new. The songwriting is solid throughout, and at least most of the songs are great. There are two or three that are merely ""Good,"" but that shouldn't hold you down. The bottom line is this album is the best contemporary recording by a songwriter from the 60's/70's since Dylan's ""Love and Theft"""
4,"Not as good as ""The Future of Food""","While this film is reasonably informative and covers the usual topics of concern associated with GM foods, including genetic drift, loss of diversity, and privatization, it feels a little choppy and repetitive. A far better film called ""The Future of Food"" was made a year earlier; that film is more factual and succinct, and also paints a detailed portrait of the incestuous relationship between Monsanto and the Bush administration. It is also no longer available -- makes you wonder!"
3,An interesting read,Not a bad book. He gets the point across about communicating with horses. Mr Blake a great trick of telling funny anecdotes to get his point across. I haven't had enough to do with horses to confirm the ESP thing yet.
1,Riding horses?,"Riding horses? To me, tackling this book felt more like falling off one and banging my head without a protective hat! Most of the advice seems to be simply stating the obvious, then repeating, then repeating, then... well, you see how annoying that is, don't you? Try dealing with chapter after chapter of it. If you want to make good use of your paper bucks and you have a horse, you might try feeding your equine friend your money. At least that way, you won't feel quite so short changed at the end of the process."
2,Oh Yeah?,"On the first night, this worked pretty well. After that, it hasn't worked noticeably -- maybe a little for a few minutes. But that doesn't qualify it as a real sleep aid."
3,Rescue Remedy Spray,Not sure it's really helping travel anxiety in older puppies but am trying different intervals and number of doses to see if I can find the right combination.
3,Like pastilles much better.,Purchased this for my puppy who gets anxious & car sick. The spray was a hastle and she would run when she saw it. I find for me the Pastilles work much better even if they are more costly. I give 1/2 Pastille for my 12 lb dog.
1,Case of desperation leading to silly purchase.,"I'm sure this work for some people, and if so it's entirely the placebo effect. Not that that's a bad thing - it's actually an enormously powerful effect that can do good in a person's life. However, for whatever reason - and against my better judgement - I bought this product because it was listed on a breastfeeding website as a tool to help a low (or non-existent in my case) let-down of milk. I used this spray as directed, and also dozens of times more. Nothin.So - nothing against Bach's. I just blame myself for letting the stress get to me to such a point that I actually spent money on this stuff.Actually I watched a Tony Robbins DVD and that took care of the problem quite well!A happy day to you -"
5,it works,this spray is incredable. it arrived on time and does have a calming effect. amazing that it works so well.
2,It does not work on me.,"I did not like this product, because this product simply does not work on me. There is nothing more to add."
2,Did not get expected reults,"I really wanted this to work, I believe Dr. Oz and he had it on his show. But unfortunately, I do not get any feeling (calming or otherwise) from the spray. Just a bad taste in my mouth. Sorry!"
5,Review of Rescue Remedy,"I have been using bach rescue remedy for years now. I believe that is does work for me when it comes to stress relief. It could be all in my head, but I like and use it on the regular. amazon.com had it for such a good price that I purchased two bottles. I do not like the drops, the spray is what works for me.Thanks"
4,Excellent introduction to Kafka unique style,"Most of the stroies are gems.Kafka's unique style lies with the way he uses the language - he manages in bringing the reader to the darkest corners of the psyche using a matter-of-fact, almost bland collection of allegedly objective observations on his protagonists' emotions, thoughts and behaviours. These protagonists are sometimes human beings but some are neither human nor animals...One could call them Kafka imagination's progeny.The reason I give it only 4 stars is because some of the stories are bordering on ...boring. I guess the reason in having them in this edition is in order to be able to call it 'The Complete Stories'.Thus - if you are ready to accept some less than stellar writing, you'll be rewarded in most of the book by an extraordinary style and truly 'kafkaesque' ideas."
3,Nice Collection - Bad Binding,"I am a long time fan of Kafka. I enjoyed seeing all of this work in one collection; however, I thought the quality of the actual physical book was well below average. If I buy a Kafka book, I want it to hold up so I can revisit it 6 months, 4 years, or 3 decades from now. Many paperbacks will provide that level of use, but I doubt this printing will."
3,Does the job.,"Way over-hyped on its commercials. I used it on Honda Accord 2000 (silver) and it didn't really make it shiny but clean. Although there were definitely water beads after the car was washed. But in the end, it does the job."
1,Damaged goods,The product arrived with a damaged container causing half the polish to be lost. I asked for a replacement bottle to be sent but they countered with a promise of a refund. To date I have received nothing.
2,Poor Spread of Polish,This motorized way of applying polish does not work well. Many streaks appear and are impossible to buff out. The non-motorized approach works much better.
1,Never Again!,"Be careful when you order from this company. I ordered a cleaver, paid it online, but I never received the order. I followed it up with them but all they did was tell me to follow it up with the post office. Whaaat? Don't even think twice. Just order from a reputable company that assures you you receive your order."
4,Crim Law Book Review,"I was happy with my purchase. It came extremely quickly, like two or three days. I would buy from this seller again."
3,"Good idea, complicated execution","Christopher de Bellaigue's book sounded like a great idea - an outsider now living in Iran looking back to the Revolution and War (the one fought against Iraq in the eighties) through the eyes of some of its protagonists. The issue is the book's ""complicated structure"" (to quote an apt phrase from a previous reviewer). I bought the book regardless thinking, ""how difficult could it be?""Ummm...quite. The book is best described as a stream-of-consciousness collection of loosely connected vignettes. While de Bellaigue's knowledge of Iran and its rich history is impressive in both its depth and breadth (that I should know a subject so well!), there are uneven and choppily paced intersections of 13th-century holy men, the author rummaging around various cities and his transcription of ""ah, my war gone by, I miss it so""-type reverie from his interview subjects. Again, great it theory, but in practice, well, it was really dificult to get any traction while reading this book."
4,Capturing the Complexity,"Klein has produced a strong, short work describing the complexity of the human being that occupied the role of President of the United States for 8 years. The Natural delivers a preliminary judgement on a presidency, rather than on the all too human individual. Instead of making psychlogical pronouncements, Klein refreshingly colors his rendition of anecdotes with possibilities and probabilities of meaning. Like the American public, who gave Clinton high marks for his official performance but wrinkled their noses at his lapses of judgement, Klein tries -- and succeeds -- to bring to light the complexity of an imperfect man trying to meet idealistic expectations in raging rapids of Washington, DC. The book is mercifully short; Klein makes his point, and doesn't try to fill the pages with distracting clutter."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"In fact, I've written to Doubleday asking for a refund. There is not a single new fact, concept or idea anywhere on the 217 pages of this major disappointment. This book is like reading back issues of newspapers -- after you've read them the first time! Klein also has a disturbing inclination (via multiple references) to pooh-pooh ethical lapses of government officials by trivializing them in the overall scheme of things.Unacceptable. Too bad,as I enjoyed ""Primary Colors"" but this is a cheap follow up."
2,"too short, unorganized","I got the impression that Mr. Klein just threw together a bunch of odds & ends he had left over from another book and notes -- the way they made the movie ""Midway"" out of edit-outs from ""Tora, Tora, Tora!"""
1,"Joe Klein, get a life!","Joe klein surely didn't want to upset the republicans, whenhe wrote this book.If he's President Clinton's friend, President Clinton doesn'tneed anymore friends like him.Would a friend write Primary Colors about his friend,then keep silent?? How kind of you Mr. Klein, to write The Natural.Please Mr. Klien don't do us anymore favors. Leave our PresidentClinton alone. Be a friend to the man who resides now in the White House.I should have known after Primary Colors, I was wasting my moneyon this book. Live and learn."
2,"Been there, done that","The book provides some lovely and inspiring photographs, but ultimately the book is, as a whole, hollow and disappointing. What Porter peddles as unique and original are actually standard craft and decorating ideas (candles, books, crystal chandeliers), and she provides precious little practical advice for transforming ideas into reality.If you're a Tracy Porter fan looking for new material, beware: Approximately 17 of the photos and corresponding instructions are projects that have already appeared on her website over the past couple of years. Or, if you have a limited amount of money to spend on books, you might want to just check out the website instead."
5,Tracy Porter's Home Style: Creative and Livable Decorating I,"What a beautiful book this is. The photography is wonderful and the thoughts are inspiring. It touches the heart of those who love old things. It brings a touch of romance into our lives. This is a perfect book with great ideas that can help you to create a lovely home. Ms. Porter said, ""surrounding yourself with loveliness."" Now that is truly a gentle thought to behold."
5,Exactly what we have been looking for!,"A few months ago we moved into a house that had no towel bars in the bathrooms. The only things that we could find (in our price range) were towel bars that came in three pieces! We wanted just one solid towel bar; one that wouldn't come apart when we hung our towels on it - we looked high and low for such an item, but none were to be found.Then I decided to search on Amazon and found exactly what we were looking for! They (we ordered two) arrived today and are solid and sturdy. We only had to buy screws and molly bolts, but not a big deal.This sturdy towel bar actually cost less than the piece of junk that we had picked up at the local ""Big Box"" store!"
2,Buyer Beware,"I have always had a high opinion of Radio Flyer products. I grew up receiving items manufactured under this name as my daughters. So when it came time to get my grandson his first bike this is the first company I thought of for my purchase. When the bike arrived yesterday, I was showing another member of my family what our grandson was getting for Christmas. I was deeply concerned with a warning on the bottom of the box. This bike does not have brakes. I can't believe that any bike would be manufactured without brakes. Tricycles, yes but bicycles? No where in the product description does it state this warning. So now I have to return this product and try to find another bike that has coaster brakes. I have to wonder how many other descriptions conveniently leave out product warnings as was in this case."
4,"Seems well made , good price - will it work? Who knows...","Little green light comes on, has phone surge protection / splitter. Seems well made and Belkin is a good name, plus it was inexpensive. Finding reviews of actual people who took a lightning hit on any of these types of items was rare, but there was one or two on the single outlet version if my memory is correct, so I transferred some of that to this one. I was a bit concerned about the one review where it would have probably caused a fire once the power was restored, but someone saw it and put it out or whatever. There was another reviewer that said they had a lightning strike and it did fine, so I am not really sure what to think. I hope it works."
5,A home cook's dream,"I am a cook who needs a recipe. No experience at my mother's knee. (She worked.) At long last here is a cookbook of recipes that are not too complicated but that have a certain flair. They are, I would say, uncommon but uncomplicated. The onion tart, for instance, consists of onions and thyme, with a dollop of sour cream in its crust. Simple, yes; devoured by my guests, yes. I suggest one should read it through first, for the introduction and the chapter headings are very informative and present the authors' wonderful philospohy that the home cook should not try to duplicate restaurant presentations. This is a cookbook that informs, encourages, promises -- and delivers. Trust me, you will enjoy this cookbook. You can, with this collection of recipes, relax and enjoy cooking for family and for discerning guests. Julia, Silver Palate, and Joy will remain on my shelves, but ""The Way We Cook"" will remain on my counter!"
5,Loved The Book,"I fully enjoyed reading this book, and found it difficult to put down. I am anxiously waiting for the next book. I found the events surrounding the new God very exciting, and the details surrounding heaven and the angels keeping the book interesting."
4,Four stars for a good but at times unclear concoction,"""The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven"", by Sherman Alexie, is incredible collection of short stories. Alexie amazes me with fantastic prose. He skillfully weaves realism and idealism to construct a bluntly ironic scene of the lives of the Spokane Indians. This book is for anyone who enjoys stark humor."
2,Indians Survival in America,"I rated this book, The Lone Ranger and Tonto FistFight in Heaven, two stars. It wasn't very interesting and I couldn't really connect with words. Few of the chapters left me confused and pondering. This book consisted of twenty-three different tales each relating about Indians. The main points that were established throughout the book were about how Indians got discriminated against by whites. Another point made about Indians was how they overcame their sorrows by drinking, telling stories, and trying to have a good time while living on the reservation. But overall the author does make some good points and analogies about Indians' struggle to make it in the world. I just felt it could've been better."
4,Another gift for the sister-in-law,"While I have not read this yet, my sister-in-law says it has been pretty good so far. I don't recall reading anything by Janet Chapman before but based on what I read on the site and what little she has revealed to me, I think it will be a good one. When I borrow it from her, I will update my review :)"
4,Carbon copy,"The book's story is perfect to read while traveling because you can leave the book whenever you have anything else to do and begin reading it later. The problem with this book is that is exactly the same plot of ""The Seduction of my Wife"" by the same author. You cut something here and paste something there but is exactly the same. So if you already read ""The Seduction of my Wife"" you can skip this one."
4,Excellent collection.,"I bought this book hoping to find an essay or two for a college class I'm teaching. The book was so fascinating, I'm going to end up using more of it than I thought. Originally, I was going to photocopy the essays, now I'm just going to have my students buy the book. I would have given it 5 stars except for the ""considerable repetition"" mentioned above. What is strongest about this book is the different perspectives that it employs."
1,Beware...rusts easily,"Terrible set. For the price you would expect it to, at least, not rust. Unfortunately, this set rusted the first time I put it in the dishwasher. Very disappointed. Cutting was inefficient at best."
5,GREAT DEAL,"I like everything of my knife set. I have been using it for almost 2 years and have had no problem at all. But you should know that you will need to get another knife for fine meat cuts. I got the 8"" J.A. Henckels separately."
3,They're OK,"The knives are Ok they work if you are trying to get by, but they won't last you. All the knives have a serrated edge so none of then cut smoothly, you have to saw everything."
3,A bucket of meh,"These are not your typical Henckels. The blades feel flimsy, the rubber grips make them feel like Play School knives, and the balance and weight just don't really work.They are better than a generic set, but its totally worth it to get the higher priced set than to deal with the frustration of these."
1,Rust after 1 use,"These are not quality Henckels knives. I have owned henckels knives before and these are not even close to the same quality as previous purchases. After a couple of uses, they start to rust, cheap metal used for the knives. They are sharp, hense the one star, but other then that I would never purchase again."
2,She's no Amy Winehouse,"A waste of my money. This album falls very short of my expectations for Ms.Stone in terms of career development. Where is the R&B ""Soul"" in this album?"
1,Nothing Good About This,"I really can't understand all of the adulation that is given Joss Stone. She's ok, at best, but very little of her work is even ok. I used to halfway like her, but that was very short-lived. Now, I think she's just another wanna-be. She sounds so phony and unnatural on this and really on her other 2 albums, even though they were a tad better. It looks like she's desperately trying to be something she isn't, nor ever will be. This album is atrocious and she's gone from bad to worse. There is nothing good to say about this CD, it screams ""phoney"" and ""desperate"". Don't waste your money on this crap."
2,Introducing Joss Stone,"Ordered on 7/12/07, shipped 9/12/07. Delivery promised for 19/12/07 but still not arrived. Complained on 3/1/08, another shipped on 4/1/08 and delivery promised on 14/1/08. DZuring the week before Christmas we were receiving regular emails from you advertising this item as in stock and promising delivery before Christmas."
4,"this is good, best is yet to come!","joss stone is a great singer with great pipes, she has looks , she knows how to move on stage and she is one of the best singers out there in the music world. I have all 3 of her cds and each one has gotten better with the new one the best,the new cd has a lot more edge and a more up beat sound and a lot more roughness to it. I think she will be around a long time and thats why even tho this is her best work to date she still has a long way to go til she gets that one cd to put her mark on the record world.she still has to put together that landmark cd ,her cd that will set her apart from everyone else, maybe she needs a new producer or maybe she is'nt old enough yet and it s not her time , she will do it tho one day and in the mean time enjoy this cd ."
1,STILL WAITING...,"Joss Stone has a strong voice. However, her pipes are totally wasted on this collection of weak songs. Even worse is the quality and total lack of musicality. For that I blame the producer. The bass is very loud, though not particularly good. The other instruments sound like they are covered in wet paper towels and strained through a brick wall. A few tasty horn tracks near the end, but by the time you get there I'm guessing you won't care. Too bad. Maybe she can call her fourth album REALLY INTRODUCING JOSS STONE."
1,Elton John: The Red Piano Blu-Ray,Awful. I cannot believe EJ would release such low quality video. Makes VHS look high tech. Don't waste your money
2,Mediocre quality at best -- do NOT expect Blu-ray,"This is a really disturbing trend...companies are slapping Blu-ray labels on sub-par video discs and upping the price. And this one is a good example of that. Elton's performance is great, but if you want and expect high definition (as you should), then look elsewhere -- and don't give your money to greedy corporations who are simply looking to cash in by misleading unsuspecting customers!!"
1,Bad idea for US buyers,"I purchased this combination DVD /CD as a gift for a friend. The DVD does not play in the US and provides an error message that it is ""limited by area restrictions"". I wrote to the company requesting a refund but they did not respond. I definitely would not buy this one."
2,Not my favorite,"I really enjoy reading Perri O'Shaugnessy, but this one is not worth reading. Just does not have the same flair and reading several of the stories left me confussed several times. Very hard to follow."
3,Unusual Parodies,"I thought this book was very unusual in the writings than the previous books I have read of theirs. In fact, I've read all but one. I really wasn't too thrilled with it. Passed it on to a friend, I'll see what her opinion is!"
1,Disappointment,"While I love Perri's Nina Reilly stories and enjoy reading short stories, this collection is a disappointment. The two Nina Reilly stories included were the best. I had a hard time getting through some of the stories and skipped several after the first few pages. The Gertrude Stein Solves a Mystery was awful."
1,All New Chilton Books,"These books are a joke! So mouch false information and so much useless information. Besides, its not even the Chilton company anymore! Just a name that the publisher is living on. If you want better information, go Mitchel or Motor Books."
3,You will be assimilated,Is everyone really going to keep throwing money at Microsoft everytime they come out with a new version of office. Can't everyone see that this just a ploy to bring in more revenue every year. I say keep your currenct version or get staroffice for free.
2,Very Average.,Nothing new its the same formula that every salsero nowadays follows...just like reggaeton...But that being said they are getting better and the Voltio son is by far the best song and prety much the best overall it was alright if these boy tweak here and there and they might make it...
5,The Movie was like New,"The move I ordered came quickly and it was used but it played just like new. I had looked for the Movie ""Eyes of Laura Mars"" for a long time on DVD. Thanks so much for such a find..."
3,Cheesy Look Back,"I was in the mood to watch this having not seen it in years... i didn't realize how old Faye Dunaway was in this, i thought she was a bit younger and I completely forgot Tommy Lee Jones was in it. It's basically an interesting take on a murder thriller and for that time it seemed really cool, I remember watching it years ago thinking it was kind of ""freaky"" but now it's quite dated. For 1978 it was pretty good stuff, but you get to look back at the vibe of that time, high fashion of the day mixed with cheesy disco-esque music. The entire movie is a type of assault to the senses."
2,Nina amada mia,"Wonderful story. The ending was rushed; it could have been developed more. Sergio Goyri and Karyme Lozano were excellent, but the DVD was too short."
4,The music is better than ever,"Rush has never been great at video. Their DVDs are always a little pedestrian. This one is no exception. The editing is not very fancy, the extras seem more like an afterthought, and the packaging is pretty unremarkable. What is remarkable is the music. These guys sound better than ever. Now that they're bigger than God, they have the money and technology to make their sound huge and expansive. Technically, they've never been better. The setlist is excellent, but it is clearly aimed at songs that are easier to sing, and pitched a little lower. It is pretty clear that while Geddy's bass playing is still amazing, he's a little old to be screeching like that banshee he once was. He barely makes it through tracks like Spirit of Radio and 2112. Still, its Rush, and who knows how many more chances we might have to see these guys live. Rush's music is the soundtrack to my life, and when they finally hang it up, a little bit of me will die."
3,"Band is still great, Geddy's voice here was SHOT!","I bought this Rush DVD because they play the entire ""Moving Pictures"" album! I have every other Rush DVD and have to say that Geddy's voice on this DVD just sucks! Maybe the long tour got to him, maybe he was sick, maybe he's getting old??The Band played great as usual, the camera angles were great, over all the whole DVD was excellent but for Geddy's vocals. They were really bad to OK throughout the DVD. He often shouted instead of sang. Real shame too as I love Moving Pictures and hope they do another DVD and play it though again but that prob wont happen."
5,Wonderful treasure for my vault,In one word: awesome! I was furtunate enough to see the Rush Time Machine for real in Stockholm. This DVD is a great memory and I'm pretty sure it was the same set list as on this DVD. Brilliant choice of songs.Just buy this and you won't be sorry!!!
3,Tom Sawyer? Again?,"True there are 9 Rush songs making their first appearance on DVD. And 16 more that we've seen a few times. Six of these tunes have appeared on at least 4 other Rush DVDs. This makes appearance #7 for Spirit of Radio and Tom Sawyer. This is what happens when you release a complete show to DVD. You wind up including all the hits that have to be played on nearly every tour. Just once I'd like to see them make a DVD focusing on deep tracks and avoid the classic songs that have appeared so many times already. Time Stand Still and Stick It Out are great choices. Now how about great songs like Tai Shan, Nobodys Hero, How It Is or Chain Lightning? Or maybe Countdown, Warpaint, Open Secrets, Cut To The Chase, Kid Gloves, What You're Doing, Think I'm Going Bald, Under The Shadow, Ceiling Unlimited, Nocturne, Freeze, Time and Motion, Virtuality, Limbo, Scars, We Hold On, Beneath Between and Beyond..."
1,Buyer Beware,"Having played this game on the PS2 I was excited when I found out that there was a PC version. I wish I had researched it first.Quoted from the Sega PSU Website ([...])""Some laptop or notebook computers may not run the game properly, even if they meet the same system settings as a comparable desktop computer. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that PHANTASY STAR UNIVERSE will be compatible with laptop or notebook computers. ""now I am stuck with a game I can't play."
1,Does not even work!,"Do know that the reason you're getting this game for $2, is because the Sega Servers are no longer operational, and the offline version of the game (story line), needs internet to start!Without internet, you can not even play the offline version.I tried it on a netbook, with minimal settings, but all I get is a black screen.Too bad, because I played PSU AOTI before, and that was an awesome game!Don't waste your $2, unless you know somewhere where they have an offline gameguard patch!"
2,"Skip this, buy its expansion","It is in my opinion that you shouldn't buy this game. If liked Phantasy Star Online, and would like to see a similar game, check out the stand alone expansion for this game (called Phantasy Star Universe: Ambition of the Illuminus). The expansion improves upon the gameplay by adding features that SHOULD have been included in this one. Take a look at my review on the expansion for a more in-depth exploration of my reasons for not liking this game."
2,Bleeds onto the paint,"I concur with the writer from 2008 and wish I had read his review prior to purchasing this product. Yes, it darkens the plastic to a nice black, but the color does run. I actually had the product run for several weeks following application and it had not even rained! Additionally, this was recently, and one would expect with the cooler weather this would be even less likely to happen. This was only one application. Yes, it wipes off clean with a micro fiber, but who wants to come upon their car with black lines running down the paint?I have heard about Forever Black, but don't like the idea of ""staining"" my plastic. Subsequently, I will continue to look for a different product."
4,Works Great,"Works great, It restored the black trim on a 2007 Fj Cruiser really well. But it didn't last long. After a couple of weeks it looked like it did before."
4,Nice Shine,I thought that the product would be thicker but it goes on smooth and last for a long time just rember to buff it out with a clean cloth or when it rain it will streek.
3,Eh. Not so great,"I use it on bumper trim which one of my cars has alot of. The trim looks good for a day or so but that's about it. Also when it rains, it leaves runny looking streaks on the trim which makes it look even worse than it actually is.Would not recommend, find another product."
2,Looked awesome until it rained,"Pretty easy to apply, and looked awesome once I was done. Sadly, it rained two days later and the product mostly washed off, leaving behind the same sun-faded greyish color my trim was before. I had read great recommendations about this product in car care articles, and thought I'd be impressed. Ended up very disappointed. Don't bother spending your money on this."
5,Helpful!,"For those exploring the field of caregiving (or those currently in it looking for some tips!), this is an outstanding exploratory work. Ms. Bloodgood not only explores the basics (how to find a position, how to find the right ""fit"", going through interviews, etc.), but she digs deeper by sharing her personal experiences throughout the process. There is some outstanding information here including finding activities for the little ones and how to resolve conflict in a *positive* manner with the parents. The appendices are fantastic, including resources for insurance, job hunting, and online children's activities. Very, very well done!"
1,Mechanical Bach,This recording is dull. The notes are there but the spirit and beauty are missing. It is mechanical and wrong-footed.
1,Not Happy,Digital Concepts 5.1 MP Digital Camera (Silver)I did not receive the cd so I can not download my pictures and we need to be in the light to get pictures worth sharing.
5,You Won't Believe Your Eyes,"I've used Mother's products for years. I've been using the 3 step cleaner, sealer and glaze, and carnuba wax and you can really see the difference. I have a 2006 Acura RSX(last year they made them), Milano Redand I can't tell how many compliments I get on it's appearance. Friends are always asking how I get it to look so good,and I've made quite a few converts. I also use their Leather cleaner/conditioner on the interior which works great and leaves the seats looking good. I've had occasion to contact Mother's customer service, and they were a pleasure to deal with. They really seem to understand how important it is to satisfy customers. You won't be disappointed with any of their products."
3,SONIC CLASSIC??? NOT BY A LONG SHOT,"""ok game, not really interesting b/c of the weird camera angle and extremely long, unnecessary load screens, not worth the buy"
1,"LOADING all the time, don't buy this game!","I wish I had rented it, cause it is ALWAYS loading, you spend at least 70% of the time waiting for it to load. Not only that but often times you don't actually play/control sonic during the game. I bought this game because of the good times I had with dreamcast, all honest, this one is a #@*!% of #$@% !"
1,Worst PS3 Purchase Possible,"I am another who deeply regrets wasting my $60 on this game. If you can stand the CONSTANT loading, then maybe you could tolerate the glitchy graphics, and average (AT BEST) storyline and gameplay.Total disappointment. Honestly, I enjoyed the original Sega Genesis version to this one, HANDS DOWN.Save your money for Rainbow 6, or Battlefield Bad Company"
2,Tedious and repititious,"I enjoyed Sonic quite a bit when it was a frenetic scroller on the DC and even the one that's out for PSP is reminiscent of the originals. Sadly, the 3d environment, twitchy controls, and unforgiving timing critical events, leave you wanting and frustrated. You're forced to repeat segments in multiple zones until you're sick to death of seeing the sequence and hearing the same droning cutsey dialog. This is exacerbated by a lack of save points. Visually it's decent, but hardly a showcase for a next-gen platformer. This one is likely to spend most of its life on the shelf."
2,"Oh Sonic, I doth weep for thee...","No nostalgia here. This game was released unfinished. Timed a 2 min load for a 2 sentence ""conversation"" (cut scene), and then an even longer load for the level right after it! The shading is absurd - using dithering and blocks.I only bought this because it was both cheap and Sonic. BAD mistake. Well, I do have a proper anthology of Sonic now, so that is something. Just don't take out your frustration on your controller, it is not it's fault."
1,waste of money,"well, since there arent many titles for my powehouse game system, i decided to go out and buy a bunch 'o games for it. well, this game is a complete waste of money. it seems that this game would be more fun on the wii, but all in all, the only games that i consder worth having are nba 2k7, resistance fall of man and maybe call of duty. note that i love basketball and football games."
2,"Unfortunately, not worth it","I was too disappointed with this game. After waiting almost 2 months to pick up my pre-order, I ran it for about 2 hours, but only got in about 45 minutes of playing. The game Loads about 4x as many times as any other game. Every 5 minutes its ""Now Loading"" something else, it loads slow, and often it just goes through the ""Now Loading"" to have a character say something, then loads again for the level..."
3,Not good but for some reason I like it....,"Not a good game, horrible load times, annoying characters, bad glitches, stupid story, but if you are a big sonic fan check it out you MAY like, if not stay away you will just end up hating this game, all in all its a bad game but theres SOME enjoyability...."
4,Fun but hard,This is A very fun game. I love the way you can Be the three Hedgehogs Sonic Shadow and silver.But this game is very hard.When I got this game in the mail I thought it would be like A normal sonic game.But it was not! Sometimes it is even hard to get to A leval!!!But I would still get this game.
1,Sonic's debut on next gen systems,I remember seeing this game at Gamestop for $20 so I thought I would give it a go. I am a huge fan of Sonic and it looked alot like Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 on Sega Genesis. The game looks great thats the only thing that can be said good about the game is that Sonic Team put alot of work into the graphics department. Everything else about the game is just terrible: the controls will leave you dying alot in this game and the camera is just horrible you'll have lots of death and have to position the camera with the right analog stick just to see where you are going. Its a terrible game and should of been better if Sega didn't rush out of the door with this just in time for it come out on next gen systems. Not worth getting if you want a good Sonic game get Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection instead.
2,Item received was NOT item pictured on Amazon,"I was disappointed that what I received was NOT the Sony Stamina battery asrepresented in the picture on the Amazon website. I received a different Sonybattery and I questioned Amazon about this. The supplier said they'd acceptthe batteries back, but did not offer to reimburse my S&H; costs to do this.I was leaving on vacation (with no time to search order and receive (again), Idecided to give the batteries a chance. They were terrible. I constantly had tostop and recharge them, they lasted like disposable batteries (unlike the SonyCybershot Stamina battery.)I missed alot of shots in Glacier & Yellowstone Park that I wanted.I was very frustrated.BE very careful, what is pictured may not be what you receive."
5,Hold charge longer,"I bought these cause I heard they hold a charge longer and I was not dissapointed. I don't know if it was because they are new or they use a different charger or they are just better batteries, but they sure last a long time between charges."
4,One of his most normal books,"Jim Thompson continues to hurt the boundaries of noir fiction. IN this book a man is hired to protect an oil baron in his hotel from somebody. That somebody changes throughout the book leavign you guessing until the final chapter. Of course like any good mystery writer Jim Thompson gives away the person in the first few pages of meeting that person but convinces you that he was only giving you a red herring. The book is normal for Jim THompson since the main character isn't completely psychotic, nor narrating and when the final chapter comes the whole narrative is neatly wrapped up without ambiguity, still it is an enjoyable read and worth recommending"
2,You Will Get Spam,"I want to concur with the other reviewer. Ever since I gave my email address to Allen's organization, I have been inundated with spam for pharmaceuticals, stock tips, and genital enhancements - the same areas he teaches his students to sell. This is the first major spam I have ever received. I think he is farming out my email to his other students as some kind of incentive to them. Be careful - do not give your primary email to his organization!The book has some decent facts, but I would be careful about using email techniques that alienate your readers!"
1,how to mass spam and talk about yourself!,"Reading this was an ENORMOUS waste of my time. Half way through the book, I realized that I didn't know anymore about making money online than I had before. All Allen does throughout this book is talk about how great he is and how he did this, that and the other thing. He talks about all these so called wonderful marketing strategies, when really all he's doing is promoting spam. I'm not even ON his mailing list and I'm getting [...] from him in my inbox. It's disgraceful. I do not recommend you waste your money on this book."
5,Makes you think.,"I read this book cover to cover, sometimes pausing to go back and reread a paragraph or chapter that really spoke to me. I am self employed, and use the internet to create residual income, some of my ventures make me around a hundred dollars a month on their own, with little or no effort on my part. I largely have this book and its author, to thank. Not everything in it has worked for me, nor do I advocate mass emailing, but a lot of the info is useful to someone who has the determinationto try, and stick with, something they are doing.Paul Buckner,author of: ""From Broke To Broker: Stories of Finding Financial Freedom""and""Gabriel Jennings and The Ferret Freedom Fighters."""
3,Another angle on Billy the Kid,"I'm not quite sure what McMurtry was trying to do with this work. It's an easy read, but if you're looking for content about The Kid, look elsewhere. Billy is an odd and occasionally tangential figure in this book."
4,Great,A great story well told. Makes you really understand the west and realize how good we have it. Great story.
5,reva shelf,It arrived on time and we are delighted with this-thank you We would recommend this product to anyone who needs a waste basket to be hidden away.
5,Great product,"Very lightweight and the voice clarity is amazing. I have it on 9+ hours a day and I have yet to have a problem with it. As one of the other reviewers had mentioned, it does feel like it will fall off at times but it has never done so. I had no problems with getting it to work with my Samsung phone. Consumer reports rated this product highly. The customer feedback helped to finalize my descision."
4,Great Headset,"This is a great product I had it for about 2 months already, This is a big difference from when I had the H500. Battery Life is good. Only thing is, it doesn't stay on my ear to well, had the same problem with the H500; a lot of time it feels like its gonna fall off, but other than that the sound quality is great."
2,Cool Design but That's All,"I bought this after reading a review claiming the ""black coloured earpiece was better than the silver."" Not the case for me. Although the design is very sleek and sexy, and opening the boom is convenient for answering calls, there is a disturbing echo heard by anyone calling me. I believe this happens because the mic on the HS850 is so close to the earphone. When the volume is up where I need it to be the sound from my earphone goes back into the mic and the caller hears a delayed copy of his voice...only when I turn the volume way down does it go away, but not all the way. Also, the ear hook just didn't work no matter which way I bent it so back it goes. Be advised that if you return something to Amazon and it's because you don't like it and not because it's broken, your shipping charges are not refunded."
2,Bluetooth headset,"Not a big fan of motorola headset and motorola cell phones. They both stink including this headset.PRO - Boom stick micCON - Hangs over your ear so it flaps, headset rest on your ear so the background noise are added to the sound, and not loud enough."
4,Bluetooth has bite.,"Product works very well. Lightweight. Easy to get started and easy to use. Moderately comfortable with a decent fit over either ear. Sound quality at both ends is very good. Great for handsfree use while driving. Attractive and high quality leather case came with it, but while wearing it on my belt, the device pops out of it when I bend over or any pressure is put on the bottom of it. Overall, I think this Bluetooth device is terrific."
5,Fantastic!,I purchased the Therabath spa and ordered the peach wax for it which I love. I use it every day to help with my arthritis in my hands and it is so soothing and helps with the pain. Not only that but it leaves your hands smooth. I love this product and would highly recommend it for others.
3,Goofey in Places,"Buy the book to save the cover. It display a German U-Boat. There's a partial photo of a submarine on the back page. And, each chapter is signaled with a small image of a submarine. So, it's about a submarine, right? Wrong. The only boat in the book is a German E-Boat. The cover designer didn't know the difference between a German U- and an E-boat! :-} One has to wonder how this got past the proof readers!! Meanwhile, the story is fair, but in places it leaves the reader saying, ""Naw, that wouldn't happen."""
5,Glad I have these,These are great filters for this price. I have no issues with scratches or falling off my lenses....they seem to be a perfect fit. I own this kit in 52mm and 58mm and if I ever get lenses that require bigger filters I will buy this brand again. I can tell a difference with these filters in my pictures!
3,"A warm, slice-of-life romance","Although published by the Jove ""Haunting Hearts"" line, A Willing Spirit is more of a slice-of-life Americana novel than it is a ""ghost story"". There is a meddlesome ghost pushing the couple together, of course, but mainly the story is about the heroine trying to fit in with her fellow townspeople who treat her unfairly. Both the hero and the heroine are decent people, honestly portrayed, who are easy to like. I was very satisfied when they eventually opened up to each other and put an end to their repetitive cycle of non-communication. Pick up this one if you're in the mood for a slower paced, character driven novel."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"I purchased and watched this movie today with my brother and we didn't find it scary at all. The music was so annoying that I kept turning the volume down every time it came on and we both thought the acting was horrible. Yes, there was a lot of atmosphere to the movie but that alone does not make a horror movie scary. We found ourselves laughing at so much of this movie it was ridiculous. My favorite horror movie is the ""Exorcist"" which still scares me every time I see it - and I've seen it at least 12 times. Yes, ""Suspiria"" was indeed a waste of time and money and we definitely would not watch it again."
1,...,Don't buy this one. A few interesting camera moves and very outdated FX aren't worth the money for it. Don't believe the hype.
3,Suspicious Suspiria Soundtrack,"I have the 1-disc DVD ""Dario Argento Collection"" version w/allsound options (THX, dts/ES, etc.), re-mastered. Gorgeous color, but all through the film, I felt something was wrong. Some of the power was gone, due to the unfamiliar soundtrack. No matter what anyone says, this version does NOT have the original sound-track. I am a musician, and I know an instrument called a ""slap-per"", made of wood that made the (much louder, as well) charac-teristic sounds on the original soundtrack. The ""extras"" sectionhas the European trailer, which has the real thing on it. Listen to that, and you know what it once was. I actually said to afriend, "" ... wait til you see the color, and hear the sound-track. They'll blow you away, themselves."" I remove 2 stars forthe near-ruination of Suspiria's original power. If you can understand a European version, and they haven't made a twinkieout of the soundtrack, get one of those instead."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!,I urge all of you to wait for the official Anchor Bay release in October/November! This is a cheap Fox version of the movie and it is edited! Wait until Anchor Bay releases the full unedited version on DVD! It will also include the soundtrack as well.
3,A Decent Horror Yarn,"I just rented this the other night due to the fact that many claim Suspiria to Be Dario Argento's masterpiece. My only previous experience with Argento is Demons, which I saw over ten years ago and intend to view again. Made in 1977, Suspiria is well ahead of its time in terms of atmospheric suspense. It's almost Hitcockian at times. It starts slowly but draws you in by the effective finale. What surprised me the most was a fairly coherent plot(Argento has a reputation for gore and style). It's not the scariest or goriest, but, if you love horror movies, you owe it to yourself to experience this film."
1,Not suspenseful or scary in the slightest,"I'm a huge horror movie fan. I've seen greats like the Chucky films, Friday The 13th remake, House Of The Dead and Cursed more times than I can imagine and I enjoy obscure horror films like IT. I was reading online that Dario Argento was a great horror director so I downloaded ""Suspiria"" to see for myself. The plot was really stupid, what's so scary about a ballet dancer going into a witches' coven? As I continued subjecting myself to it I discovered that NOTHING in it was scary! It didn't have enough gore, over-produced special effects or a really scary looking killer. Another minus was that it's really old. Skip this and check out the films I mentioned earlier for quality horror."
1,Concerning the awful dubbing...,"It's not the point that Italian films were shot this way. Spaghetti westerns are a whole different animal. They had sparse dialouge and the bad dubbing didn't matter to the plot, but Suspiria, a film that depends on suspense and thrills, is a different matter. The english dubbed track is so bad it takes you right out of the picture.I would much rather listen to a dubbed Italian track and read subtitles than have to listen to bad and laughable performances in english. A perfect example would be Argento's Bird with a Crystal Plumage - a teriffic mystery thriller that greatly benefits from it's multiple language tracks.All I'm saying is to at least give the viewer the choice."
3,Interesting But Not Great,"Yes, the lighting and photography are different from other films though I kept imagining the colored lights off camera. The acting and script are pretty good as is the general production design but as a classic horror film, Suspiria rates rather low in my opinion because the blood just doesn't look at all real and if the blood in a horror movie doesn't look real, the film has failed. That's a shame too since I loved the surround soundtrack."
5,The BEST horror/splatter film of all time!,"I have seen plenty of horror films, and none have the gorgeous atmosphere or beautiful camera techinques as this film. Mr. Argento (the savior of Italian horror) has such a capacity to shock and terrify, and Suspiria is probably his grandest achievement. I strongly recommend obtaining a COMPLETELY uncut and uncensored copy of Suspiria (which runs around 107 minutes) to get the full effect and to truly appreciate this grand film."
1,More like: SUCKSPIRIA.,"My metric I use to guage the worth of a horror film is relatively simple: Does it scare me? The answer in this case is an unequivocal NO.The acting is thin, the plot hardly sustainable and the cinematogrophy average at best. There are simply very few redeeming qualities in this movie.The most frightening aspect in this anti-climactic absurdity is the acting (and the dubbing). Scary stuff indeed. The soundtrack is passable, but tolerable music does not a horrifying movie make. You can't polish a turd.I sincerely can not understand the positive reviews this cinematic atrocity has garnered."
2,Disappointing,"I realize I am in the minority and that Suspiria is well-reviewed by many, but I found it to be a totally amateurish effort. The effects are awful (fake attacking dogs, bats on strings, and blood that looks like day-glow tempera paint.) It is stylish, but the colored lighting is overdone and the whisper and scream filled soundtrack gets annoying... The plot is disjointed and uncompelling, and the ending is unsatisfying...I can't believe that people compared this to the Exorcist and Shining."
3,Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA!!!,"It started off pretty good and creepy, but there were some parts that were kinda boring. There were some awesome beautiful scenes of bright beautiful red, green, and blue colors! I love the dark and rainy night and showing all the colors! Suzy goes to a fancy ballet school and some strange things start happening like people disappearing, dogs eating their owners, maggots in all the rooms, and the supernatural witches hanging around!!!! If you like Dario Argento and Italian horror, you might like SUSPIRIA!!!"
5,Blow your mind,"When I smuggled this from Begium on the Best Video label I did not think much of it coss it was grainy, one scene was cut and it was not meant to be seen in that state. However, I decided to view it this way and what an experience. WOW! It is mazing, uncut, great quality in sound and picture letting you enjoy this classic the way it should be seen."
4,Where are the sub-titles?,"An excellent transfer of a long awaited release. But while the original Italian soundtrack is included, there are no sub-titles! That would have made it truly definitive in my opinion, compare Deep Red w/subtitles, why short change us non-Italian speaking Italian movie affectionados. I mean, who do they think is buying this title?"
1,Pitiful attempt at horror,"This was, without a doubt, one of the most pathetic excuses for a horror movie I've ever seen. I'd say about three quarters of it was nothing but some girls fartin around yapping about nothing. There are just a few very short killing scenes, which aren't that great. The soundtrack everyone seems to rave about sounds like a few kids in a basement banging on trashcans. I wouldn't reccomend this movie to anyone. I'd suggest movies by Lucio Fulci, such as The Beyond, House by the Cemetery, or Zombie, to name a few."
3,Suspiria,"I liked the movie compared to later(demons), I think it was more scarier and the music was eerily good. the movie isn't great,but it's better than the later work in my opinion.I could go without the most violent parts,I think besides that and the premise,the movie is good and the acting ain't bad and dubbing ain't so bad either."
3,Pretty good...,"Well, being completely honest, I think this was a great movie OVERALL. The music is quite annoying frankly, I didn't care for the music, and it didn't fit that great with some scenes. A lot of the movie was kind of a lead up to the last 20 minutes (which happened to be unbelieveable). I thought the concept was excellent, but with a better cast of actors, and a better story, to keep viewers entertained with the mystery, rather than the place of where Susy is...I'd say this movie can be a lot better, but is definetly worth seeing"
2,Bit by the same dog twice,"I bought this largely due to rave reviews here. What a shockto realize I had seen this before - in its theatrical release.Didn't like it then, don't like it now. The music's just wierd enough to be compelling, and I like Jessica Harper, it's just that the movie is less than the sum of its parts. Blurry red hallways, funhouse lighting, cliched characters (check out the Cloris Leachman-like teacher with the German accent and the vaguely militaristic outfit) - I just don't get the appeal.Might seem raw and arty to someone who never saw a foreign film before."
2,What is this??,"After I finished watching this I could only wonder why ""Suspiria"" attained such a cult status. There were a few brief periods of suspense, and the mood and atmosphere make it somewhat interesting; however, you need more ingredients than this to come out with a decent movie. Not horrible, but mediocre at best."
1,one of the worst films i've ever seen,wow! suspira is super bad. i love horror and jessica harper and i'm surprised i bothered to watch through the end... don't bother.
1,DON'T buy this book if you are a beginner!,"Having been a college teacher for over 30 years I would cite this book as the perfect example of how NOT to write a technical guide! Arcane terms are used without any word of explanation. If you want to know how to actually use Paint Shop Pro this book will not even get you off the ground. If you don't find it utterly confusing and mystifying you must already be very familiar with the program.In which case, you would not need this book!What is REALLY needed is a sort of Paint Shop Pro for Dummies. This book doen't even begin to take that kind of approach. It's difficult to imagine just who would find it at all useful."
2,You'll sleep soundly. Don't forget the blanket.,"Good heavens, is this film boring. Long, meandering, poorly edited, well-shot, and generally well-acted (with the exception of Milla Jovovich...this film is at least noteworthy for highlighting her lack of charisma and acting talent in a stunningly effective manner). This film, a ""mood piece""? Perhaps, if that translates in English to ""we forgot to include an actual story/film somewhere in all of this footage we spent our energies on"". An overrated snoozefest."
2,Far too many missed opportunities,"This film 'left me cold' in several ways. Character development was weak--with so very many opportunities to enrich their roles and relationships. Likewise, numerous storylines never fully developed, resulting in fragmented and disjointed scenes that were somewhere between boring and downright confusing. Some secondary characters were more developed than the apparent primary roles. The final scene(s) of the movie would have been better placed at the beginning of the film. I found the saloon scenes the most developed, where the characters were given rare opportunity to portray emotions, and character relationships were more evident. Brothel sex scenes came across as, ""we'll insert sex scenes in here because it's a movie seller."" Very, very disappointing overall..."
2,An Epic Bore,"Sytle over substance in this bleak, dreary, cimino-lookalike. The characters faded into obscurity as the director attempts to make his film more than it is. He absolutely aims for EPIC when his screenplay and characters are not up to the task. I gave it two stars for wardrobe and cinematic audacity. There were great sweeping scenes of mountains, snow, barroom burlesque, fires, railroads, but little in the way of an engaging plot.Other reviewers have given the basics of the plot and setting, so I won't repeat that information here. Suffice it to say that as this film dragged on, I eagerly anticipated the ending, not because I was curious about the outcome, but because I was weary."
1,Awful,"This blew. I got suckered by the blurbs on the front of the box. I don't see how Siskel and Ebert gave this movie two thumbs up. The story is bleak and depressing. Not a single character is likeable. They're all antagonists. Anyhow, watching this movie is a major waste of time."
2,How did it go SO wrong?,"It's hard to add more to what has been said in the other reviews but with the powerful story of the ""Mayor of Casterbridge"" to ""inspire"" it, and a strong director and cast, how did it go SO wrong? Editing mostly I'd say, I asked myself halfway through ""where's the plot?"" and didn't even realize it was borrowing from Thomas Hardy till about the three-quarter point. Confusing, un-coordinated and a huge waste of time. Yes, dammit, it WAS boring! Hey, but those two Portugese songs were good; I don't think the singer got credited."
5,A Total Delight,"Anybody who loves real, traditional, Irish music should absolutely love this CD. It ranges the gamut of all that there is to love, cherish, and enjoy in this culture. For the instrumentals, I especially enjoyed cut 5 consisting of Mullins'Fancy, The River's Hank of Yarn, and Gilbert Clancy's, featuring flute, Uilean pipes, and guitars. Those dances are followed by the emotional ""Ireland, Love of My Heart"". Dierdre's singing has to touch the heart of anybody who has any Irish blood in them at all. Paddy Reilly's vocal backed by fiddler John Sheehan makes ""Down By the Glenside"" another absolute standout. However, all of these are great and muchly recommended."
2,Not their best.,Have two other Cherish the Ladies CDs and love to listen to them. This title is a disappointment. Wish I had heard it before ordering. Too many other voices and the sound is not consistent. I had to keep adjusting the volume. Not happy.
2,Doesn't take you away....,"I bought this because I thought it was vintage psychadelia. It is -- crazy guitar all over the place, organ a lot of the time...but it was also disappointing. For me, psychadelic music is about taking you away, letting your soul drift. Think of the Doors' ""crystal ship"" or Donovan's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" or Love's ""Forever Changes"" album. There is a mystical quality, a surreal, ethereal, melodious drifting at the heart of good psychadelia. This album is more Rock. It tends to be harder -- more like ""In a Gadda..."" by Iron Butterfly. If you like that vein of psychadelia -- heavy masculine vocals and junior high guitar riffs, then you'l dig this. If you are like me and you prefer more drifting, folkish psychadelia that takes you to the land of purple flowers, then you'll be let down.Best from Shadocks that I've found so far is The Brigade. Check it out..."
2,Meh.,This product was a little weaker and flimsier than I was expecting for the price. I thought it would be more of a heavy duty durable plastic liner but it is rather thin plastic that seems like it may split with much wear and tear. It also does not fit all that well and there is a gap between the product and the sides of the car. Being that it was designed specifically for the Liberty I was expecting a snug fit in order to protect the carpet underneath.
1,not good,"I bought this to use as a regular serial card without the power pass through. I followed the instructions and could not get it to work. After 2 different revs of the card and two calls to tech support, they still could not get it to work. The drivers are also a mess. I tried all their versions plus the chipmaker's own drivers and even Windows own update service. None of them worked. From talking to tech support, I got the sense, this card has many issues."
3,Not bad but a little lean in parts,"I expected a little more from this book, but it wasn't bad. I liked the Georgia stuff since that's Tony's gig, but it was a little lacking on some of the other southern football ""powerhouses."" If you're looking for a comprehensive look at the most powerful conference in the country, try out the Tailgater's Guide to SEC Football. It's killer. In all, a nice addition to the collection. I give Barnhardt 3.75/5.00."
4,General Grievous,"My son had asked for this action figure because of the accessories that came with it. He loves it. The attachable cap and light sabers galore, he plays with it everytime there is a battle between Obi-Won and General Grievous."
3,American Horsepower,"While a good book in general, there are serious omissions that should have been caught by the editor.While the Model A and X Duesenbergs were well described, the much more dramatic J and SJ have no photos of these engines. Why? If there ever was a spectacular American engine these were certainly it.Photos are all over the place for both of them and easily obtained, from the ACD Museum for one source.Leaving out the Marmon V-16 is a bad omission.Poor decisions by either the author or the editor."
3,Not enough coverage,Too reliant on industry information and not enough from the speed merchants of the era. Over promoted for an enthusiast.
2,a chore to get through,"although i admire the author's use of language, and do admit he's a very good writer, i had a rather hard time with this book. i usually read about a book a week (generally not fluff), and it took me almost a month to get through 2/3 of it. i had a lot of trouble keeping track of all the characters -- i actually made a series of ""family trees,"" trying to figure out how everyone in the book was connected. that helped, but didn't make the book any more fun to read. (the author should have included some sort of chart or legend in the book -- i kept looking for one every time he introduced a new character). maybe the ending makes the whole book worthwhile -- i don't know. i gave up before i finished. maybe if i had read the first book of the trilogy, i would have gotten more out of it. as it is, i've moved on to books that are a pleasure to read, rather than a chore."
5,"The ""Steinbeck"" of Spiritual Poetry",Hauntingly transcendental and permeating with tenderness... Must have!
4,PIctures of a Beautiful Man.......,Just ordered the book for myself. I am a huge Dlh fan and liked the pictures that highlight the start of his career to the present. I would like to see a more current one though. A must for any Dlh Fan.
4,Great condition!,I was not aware that these are condensed versions - thought they were the whole and real thing. My son loved them though and i guess thats what counts!Books in great condition and would recommend seller!
1,Not worth the money,Dowa not fit snug and very flimsy. Always bunching up and moving around. Would takeObey back in 2 seconds
5,Beautiful piece,"Gorgeous piece! I bought this for my wife, and she gets a lot of compliments on it. Fast hassle-free shipping as well. I always get great products from Silver Insanity."
4,Erudite Book Filled With Facts,"James Davidson's Courtesans and Fishcakes is a marvelously complex book that is at times fun, at times dull, but always filled with new insights strung through as pearls in the verbiage. The book is not as accessible as it is claimed by some to be. I have a bit of background in classical studies and I needed every scrape of it to plow through this book. The historical framework necessary to understand what the Athenians were passionate about was never given and would have been a help for the non-classical studies buff. In the end, this book is definately worth the ride and the reader will appreciate the struggle. A very intelligent book that requires much from the reader but will also deliver even more back."
3,brings the ancient world to life but tough to finish,The best part of the book is how it brings the ancient world to life. What did these folks do day-to-day? That said unless you're doing an academic thesis on this topic you might lose interest halfway through.
3,For special interest readers only,"The book is well put together, but too dry for an average non-fiction reader. This is not a light read. Unless you've read more Greek lit. than just Homer and know a fair amount about the individual city states it will be an uphill read (as it was for me). Some small knowledge of the Greek language or Ancient Greek would help.Oh, for a classical education!"
5,"About racism, the truth.",This book is gutsy and truthful-- written by a black man who has experienced racism from all sides. He sheds new light on an old issue not only from several generations but several lifetimes. His insights are amazing and his willingness to share from his own life is courageous. This is a good little handbook for irradicating prejudice of all sorts.
1,Horrible.,"This book was absolutely ridiculous. No copyright or publishing information. It looked like it had been printed from microsoft word. No sidenotes, line numbers. Don't purchase this book for Shakespeare's sake."
5,"Excellent, romantic,exciting and a play of compelling wit.",Much Ado about Nothing is a wonderful romantic comedy.Shakespeare does an excellent job of focusing on the everyday antic's of love. His two main characters Beatrice and Benedick are delightfully funny.They are two people who as they throw witty insults at each other fall in love.The other characters add life and merriment to this wonderful play.You will truly feel uplifted and happy after reading it
4,I have a massage congealed in a long distance dick,"I like watching this with a glass of wine late at nite in the dark. No one will watch it with me and that is ok.It is a spoof of ww 2 occupied france. The jokes are broad and the stereotypes are over the top but I don't care it is funny in the silliest way. Everybody in france seems to want to get down rene's pants. ( Which is so ludricrus and hilarious because rene is bald, chubby and kinda whiney.Even a certian german officer who acts so gay you wonder if it is a put on to get ahead constantly comes onto him. Some of the gags get old like the bad dressing in drag, but most do not. Like Officer crabtree butchering the french language ."
5,IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER,"Ahhh... the joys of revisiting Cafe Rene in full DVD quality!!! The best sitcom ever just keeps getting better with every series' release. I wish I could live in Cafe Rene! I WISH I WAS RENE! (Wait, that's going too far -- Rene will surely end up getting shot by his wife, or killed ""in the act"" by one of his waitresses, or knifed by Madame LaMountain, or bombed by Denise LaRoque, or done in -- quickly & with style -- by Monsieur Alphonse the undertaker). GREAT FUN and more than worth its weight in exploding Christmas puddings."
4,Really easy for person not able to stand,Can't stand or walk w/o aid of walker or cart. I get very little excerise and found this cd to be very easy and helpful to get some daily excerise in.
5,great gift for my mom!,I gave this to my mom as a birthday gift. she received it timely and has been using it since that time. thank you!
2,disappointing...,"This is what you would expect, would be the ultimate cd collection for fans of this memorable disco group... and after shelling out quite a bit to get to get my hands on it, i was very dismayed to find that their two best known hits, ""I cant stand the rain"" and ""one way ticket"" weren't presented in their original glory, but as very weak ""'94"" remixes. This would've been fine, but the original versions were omitted completely! beware..."
3,Lacking,"This is a small book on philosophical musings, where the author attempts to pose some questions and create arguments to counter some ""intuitive"" answers to them.First of all, as fiction, the storyline is as lame as More's Utopia, in that the personal stories and circumstances surrounding the conversation are pretty much meaningless. The book is written in a conversation style, where the old man does most of the talking, and the listener periodically asserts a couple of confused statements.The main problem I have with the book is that the questions are nothing insightful: in fact they have been asked and answered in much better - and better written - books. The answers provided by the book contain some elements of original thinking, but while some of them are a ""bit out there"", it simply comes down to the fact that they are just not that interesting."
4,You Will Not Find the Meaning of Life (or Reality) Here,"But with an open mind, you will find a fun mental exercise that is neither going to make a religious zealot out of an atheist, nor vice versa. As an engineer, I did come across technical flaws; but I don't think they detract from the point of the story. On the contrary, I feel the concept of questioning the accepted precepts of science and society to be healthy. Many of the one- and two-star reviewers really took this way too seriously. (As Scott Adams anticipated many would in his Introduction.) Let's face it; if you are going to a cartoonist for deep philosophy, physics, cosmology or religion, one really needs to question your motives and rationale. However, what a gift to find one that can come out with a fun, non-comic-strip story to tweak both religious and scientific devotees with the message that we all follow the delusions that we choose to embrace."
1,Scott Adams should stick to cartooning. He's great at that.,"As a theologian and philosopher, Scott Adams is a great cartoonist! Why isn't that enough?"
5,Still asking WHY after sept 11?,"This is a fantastic book to read if you are still unsettled with the tragic events of September 11.After reading this book, by surprising philosophical Scott Adams..(who you may also know as the creator of Dilbert (?)..I walked away almost a new person. This is a great gift!!!"
2,There are lot's of Flaws,"Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time.I couldn't get pass the page where Mr. Avatar says ""probability"" is a major force driving the universe. As any mathematician can tell you there is no such thing as probability. Probability Theory is merely a tool to help our limited understanding of complex phenomena.If there is something of value within these pages it is probably the urge to ask Big Questions; something you can get almost everywhere else. Reading Asimov's fiction or any philosophy book would be better."
2,thought provoking but wrong,"I just read the book as a choice in a book discussion group. we have not discussed the book yet.Its the first book of this type Ive read in a long time. I'm still trying to figure out what Scott Adams is trying to do by asking readers to find the flaws in the books's all knowing character Avatar's ideas. It seems to be a bit of a setup, watchout!."
2,"Silly, but somewhat thought provoking","I like the concept that the author is trying to get the reader to think outside of our norms, but the scientific information that he attempts to incorporate into the novel are grossly off-base. Since the author regularly skews scientific concepts to make his it makes the book seem ignorant at times. I am in my third year of medical school and graduated undergrad with honors with a hard science degree, so I have a pretty firm science background, and I know many points in the book are inaccurate. The author does state in the introduction that part of the book may be ""bull,"" however, so the reader should keep this in mind and enjoy the book for what it is."
2,Better choose the deeper wisdom,"I would better choose some Dr.M.Laitman kabbalah book. This one holds a few things of his books... well, let say taken of kabbalah, well again ... the ideas that are described in there, not of M.Laitman himself. But anyway - two stars for starting to think :) What about you?"
4,Interesting and thought provoking,"This is a book that will really make you think. The whole point of the book is to try to find where the argument that is presented in the book is wrong. Not an easy thing to do - as long as you work within the framework presented (some of the facts that are offered to support the argument are obviously wrong, but must be accepted as basic postulates - you don't have to agree with them, but whether they are right or wrong doesn't really impinge upon the thought expieriment presented). It's a form of writing that hasn't been done much recently (Think something closer to ""Plato's Republic"").One thing that should be mentioned - This is NOT a Dilbert book. It contains no humor and no cartoons. If that is what you are looking for, then pass this book.In short, if you are looking for something that will make you think try this."
2,A friend let me borrow it - thank God I didn't buy it,"I thought this book would be pretty insightful, but instead I felt I was reading ramblings of a drunk-philosopher-wannabe.I didn't really feel more than one or two arguments Adams made held water, and I realized that even those probably were only because I just didn't have an opinion off hand. Most of my rebuttals came before I finished reading the paragraph at hand.I give two stars instead of one, because Adams actually made an attempt to think deep, but I don't honestly feel he is qualified, as his writings were so very shallow and uninspiring.Do yourself a favor, and save your philosophical inquiries for Socrates, Descartes and Nietzsche."
1,Nothing new,"Those who find this book ""ground breaking"" or that it ""spins their minds"" have done very little reading in philosophy, theology, or modern physics. The ideas presented by the author have been thoroughly covered, and this book adds nothing to them. In fact, much of what he proposes has been investigated and discarded. His science is just plane wrong. If the author had studied these areas, he would not have wasted his time, and ours, in this simple-minded essay.Go read some serious books on these topics instead."
2,Terrible,Neither my husband or i could get into the movie. I dont think i would ever watch this film again. It was not What it was made out to be.
4,Good comedy with a few great moments,"Ramis wrote and directed this one very nicely, and got more laughs out of DeNiro than Crystal. DeNiro plays the same character he plays in almost every movie, give or take, but at least here he gets to mock himself for doing it. Most of his laughs are more due to his playing off his stereotype than any inherent comic genius, but it works often and well.The only weak bits are where he's crying and trying to be funny. They fall flat. When he just plays Gangster Bob and lets Ramis and Crystal weave the irony around him, things flow quite smoothly. The basic conceit of a mobster needing therapy creates a huge target, and Ramis hits plenty of bullseyes. It's a crisp little film, all told, and Palmintieri is the best of the supporting actors.Analyze This is good humor, and well worth seeing if you like either of the leads or gangster movies in general. It's no Goodfellas, but it's good."
4,"Funny, Witty and Wise","Billy Crystal returns to form with the help of De Niro, in possibly his greatest comedic role as a Mafioso needing psychological intervention. The script is fast and furious, a laugh riot of memorable lines and deliveries that come atcha like repeated pitches of a baseball. The scene where Crystal represents his client before all the Mafia leaders is a comedy classic, one that is hilarious and poignant at once, but only because Crystal plays his character in such an inspired way. Truly a valentine of comedy, this is a keeper!"
2,AMUSING 2.5 STAR COMEDY,"This was an amusing movie, but the language is 100% gutter. Rounded down from 2.5 stars to 2 stars for language. I Acutally liked Analyze That a little better than Analyze This. but now that I've seen them once, I see no need to see them again, and if I did it would it would be with head set on, and sound off."
2,I was Disappointed,It wasn't that great. It wasn't that believable to me either. A mobster going to a shrink because he's having panic attacks? I just didn't find this movie very funny at all. I like Billy Crystal. I like Robert DeNiro. But not in this movie.
4,A wonderful comedy with an interesting premise.,"The first time I saw this movie, I laughed so hard, it hurt. This was a wonderfully funny film. DeNiro was terrific except for the crying (once or twice would have been enough). I enjoyed watching Billy Crystal. He proves again he can do almost anything. The man has talent! I also enjoyed the performance of Joe Viterelli and would like to have seen more screen time for Chazz Palminteri. My compliments to Harold Ramis for making it work and for Tony Bennett. That was a nice touch. Salute."
2,You Won't Find A Lot Of Laughs Here,"The movie was watchable (rent from Blockbuster or another video rental store). Don't waste your money buying the DVD, although the ""out-takes"" portion of it was worth more laughs than the movie. Which isn't saying much."
1,read the books,If I want to sit through a boring presentation where every noteworthy concept is repeated 9 times I'd go back to school where I can at least have fun with my fellow students.Don't buy the terribly bad filmed presentation buy the book instead. I mean his theories are as crazy as they are interesting to know about but far better to absorb in written form.
3,Good book but could have been better organized/written.,"I have written several books for my job so I know a bit about organization, style, etc. This book has a lot of great info in it. Being a resident of IL and interested in the topic, I gave it a read. Organization, as it is, makes it difficult to go back and use as a reference in the future. It also should have been written in an even more basic style and language. For example, I'm not sure my grandmother would have an easy go at understanding all of the contents of the book because she has no political background, but she might be interested in reading it just based on the title."
1,Leaks constantly!,The leak is from the very bottom where the ball bearing is at. I paid $60 for this piece of junk and when i complained to Lixit they would not even send me a replacement.
4,Large tube...too big for rabbits.,"This is a high quality product. Just be careful...in the product description it is stated that it could be used for rabbits. This is way too big a tube for small animals. The water shoots out when licked. Better for puppies or small dogs. Not worth the hassle to return, but just thought others should know. It does come in three other sizes. This is the 5/8"" tube. I should have known, but I couldn't visualize it until it was in front of me. Like I said, though, it is well made and looks like it will last forever- just BIG."
2,Slingshot poor pouch,The twin flat bands with plastic pouch that come with the Saunders Double Eagle Pro Wrist Rocket Slingshot do not release the 38 cal. metal balls. The metal ball comes back and hits my hand as the bands snap back after release. I believe the plastic pouch is the problem. When trying a larger projectile it released better. Still not a real good product in my opinion. I guess I am comparing it to the nice wrist rockets with surgical tubing from when I was a kid. I'll keep looking for a better product.
1,Product mixed - Technical Support the worst,"I just got my KVM which I'm using to replace an earlier KVM. So far the new KVM is working mostly OK. However the manual says that it supports hotkeys that can be used to switch between computers. Unfortunately the manual doesn't say another word about this feature (e.g., what are the hotkeys and how to use them).I've tried emailing and calling Belkin technical support and they have a bunch of idiots who barely speak English handling this important part of their business. Nobody there seems to be able to string more than a few words together to explain how to use their own product.Belkin should be ashamed of themselves!"
5,Very good,Great explanation and background of all the passages - good daily devotional. I had perviously purchased Barclay's Gospel of Matthew and was happy to move on to Mark.
2,go buy the manga,"i went to see this pile of... at the cinema and what a waste of time and effort that was. i then got it on vhs, but only becasue it was doubled with the infinitely superior ""battle angel alita""this anime is simply not worth the money. go hire it from a video shop so you can see for yourself. and then go and buy the manga, which is from a totally different world."
4,READ the comics! Masamune is a genius!,"Masamune Shirow is a wonderful writer & artist. The appleseed comic series is really wonderful: both intelligent, funny & beautifully drawn, everyone I've lent this to or bought it for has LOVED it..The video is interesting, but might dissapoint. The story is well done, but lacking the details and beautiful art of the comics. It is not as good as his other stories on video (M-66 Black Magic, about escaped battle droids that need to be recaptured) and Ghost in the Shell (about intelligence in the robot and computer systems and what is a soul, anyways?) ...But: I still recommend this! =)"
5,Very Detailed,I had bought Emotional Intelligence about a month before I decided to try Social Intelligence and I was hoping it would be just as interesting/informative as EI...it was even better. The writers/psychologists go into extreme detail about how a person interacts with other people on an emotional level and explains what determines if people walk away feeling better or worse. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in how people interact and create emotional bonds.
2,Difficult style to read and follow,"I bought this book, as I am interested in improving my social skills, especially in the business environment. The thing is that it is written as a series of un-linked short stories to prove his theory. Even though it proves the point, in my opinion it is very difficult to read and follow. I am kind of disappointed, as I have read other books and articles from him, and I am having a hard time reading it."
2,Disappointing,"Goleman is adept at sounding impressive, but this book contains little of substantive value. It seems designed to confirm the average person's existing beliefs rather than to educate. He often mentions research of marginal relevance using unnecessary technical jargon in ways that sound superficially authoritative.The subject of the book might be better described as social skills rather than intelligence.One example of how the book annoyed me was this jab at a strawman: ""to the great surprise of those who believe genes alone determine behavior""."
1,Doesn't work on many laptops and desktops,"Bought the game, I met the specs, and then it crashes when I run it. Further investigation shows that it won't work on my machine, and there is no patch to support it. Very disappointed!"
4,4 years and still going,"I have been using the oven every day for over four years and love it! Other reviewers say there handle broke in half and so did mine, I just stick a fork in it to hold it down and it works fine. A year ago I bought one of the digital expensive types and used it for three days and gave it away and went back to this one, broken handle and all. I use a 9"" baking pan to cook rolls and so it dose not have a problem with peeling chrome like those cooking directly on the rack.I knocked off a star for the broken handle, otherwise it's 5 star's."
1,Great,"Another Marvel by the Boys, I have been a big fan all my life fifty years of great music to quench the surfer gang"
1,Disgusting!!!!,"How would people react to a ""funny"" 9/11 shirt? How about a ""funny"" Rodney King shirt? Maybe a ""sarcastic"" Martin Luther King shirt? For sure, a ""funny"" Natalie Holloway shirt!This is America and people have the right to say what they want, but sometimes they should keep their ideas to themselves. The designers, manufacturers, suppliers, sellers (yes, you Amazon) and purchasers should be ashamed of themselves.To make a joke (and a profit) of a tragic situation is deplorable."
1,AMERICAN VIOLENCE,Violence continues to be a great product of capitalism; an ever present perverse demand and a never ending product supply.We condemn foreign terrorists but fail to acknowledge our domestic terrorists and our deteriorating quality of life due to the violence that permeates throughout American systems and individual behavior.I find this item depicting violence displayed as a badge of honor indicative of our self destructive American society.
4,Great for snacks! College dorm food!,"I disagree with the previous reviewer. We were MORE than pleased with the quantity of Dolphins & Friends. My younger son takes them to school and still has plenty to share with friends. I have sent these as gifts to college age kids to share amongst the students in the dorm. The dolphins arrive in a box that is 19x12x6 and all individually wrapped.I still prefer Goldfish, but the kids (even the teens) have not noticedthe difference!!A GREAT buy!!I say GO FOR IT.Amazon:In the future, reviewers should NOT be allowed to leave their thoughts if they have not purchased the item. You cannot have an opinion, or a legitimate one if you don't have the item."
5,AMAZING,"I seriously don't understand why anyone thinks this is a small portion size. I am a 15 year old girl, and find there to be MORE than enough crackers whenever i eat this. It's extremely filling, which is nice when you're hungry. We would always get them on our bus ride home after a day trip at my camp. The bus is filled with kids from grades 3-10, and everyone is more than satisfied.A GREAT tasting snack! I recommend it for anyone who like goldfish but wants something MUCH better."
1,Search Again,"This book unfortunally is alot of bs.This is an attempt to understand the basics of Kundalini Yoga (Chakras and Aura) but it fails completely. The Hindu writings are not even there...there is so much Christianity thrown into this that you might as well pick up a copy of the New Testiment.I can understand trying to make this subject open and understandable to the western view point, but there are alot better books on the market for doing so. You cannot just put something like this into christianity and get a true view of how these things work. There is no description in here at all of the very basics of WHY this matters at all. You need at least a minor basis in Eastern Philosophy, even if you do paint it with a Western brush.I do not see how anyone could walk away with any understanding at all from this book."
1,Misleading book title and chapter titles,Reminds me of the comment by a wise man on a book - 'There is something new and something true in the book - except what is new is not true and what is true is not new.'I could not relate to the book...may be you would.
5,Desoldering par Excellence,I have used an air powered desoldering device for over 10 years in a commercial service environment. The Hakko 808 is like a vacation. A very relaxing work experience comes with this tool. I will buy another justto make sure I never have to return to the old method of board-level solder removal. speedodoc
5,best that I've found,"I use this a couple times a day for TV repair ,,,This is my fourth one since 1995...Works great as long as you keep it clean."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I bought this book because I had heard of the author due to my knowledge of France and the French language. (Also, I knew that his wife, Arielle Dombasle, was one of the most beautiful women in France. Although she is French, she was born in the USA to an American mother and she carries an American passport.) I found the prose in the book somewhat rambling, disjointed, and seldom interesting, let alone entertaining. The contents of the book just did not seem to have any real purpose or goal; it was mostly a random collection of thoughts and observations, many of which were seemingly pointless. Perhaps it is unfair for me to say this, but this book just re-inforced my belief that one of the problems with France is that the country has too many so-called philosphers, of which BHL is one."
2,Doesn't work,"I really wanted this radio. I like the looks of it, but I had a couple problems with it. At first it wouldn't charge. I could use the batteries and pick up a weather channel. Eton sent me a new rechargeable battery, and it didn't work either. Then I realized that the connector was loose. Then the charge held, but now I couldn't pick up a weather channel. Not even static. The radio looked good, customer service was great, but the radio was not. I'm afraid to buy another."
4,Dependable,"Unless you have crazy expectations, this radio is good for the price. I had to use it recently after Hurricane Gustav blew through our area, and everything I needed it to do, it did just fine. The radio reception was clear, flashlight threw off a good amount of light, and it was compact and sturdy. The radio was on continuously for three days with the same batteries. It was also nice to get a tv station, to get a break from the continual blather about the situation around town. I didn't try the cell phone charger."
1,Bait-and-switch,"Product was advertised as Porcini Powder. The product that we received was labelled 'Dried Mushroom Powder.' It looked greyish rather than the richer cinnamon-brown color of porcini powders that I have purchased in the past from another company. More importantly, tasted/smelled like ""watered down"" porcini, not 100% porcini. Looks like a 'bait and switch' to me and we will definitely not order again."
5,Daring analysis of Supreme Court's most contentious cases!,"Starting with the Supreme Court's decision in _Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, KS_, Graglia shows that the emperor has no clothes. Claiming to be acting against racial discrimination, the Court first disallowed race-neutral policies, then actively enforced racial discrimination. The one hopeful element of Graglia's tale is that while people in Washington, DC proved supine in their unwillingness to oppose the Supreme Court's misdeeds, average people from Denver to Boston took to the streets in defense of self-government. The politics of the last 23 years owe much to the arrogations chronicled in Graglia's book."
4,Great devotional for boys,"This devotional workbook was just about everything we were looking for in a devotional book for our son. My daughter is using the one for girls 9-12. It offers a scripture reference, then a short illustrative story, a few questions, suggestions for prayer time and an activity to reinforce! We LOVE these books and hope to find another one for this coming school year.I subtracted one star because the questions are sometimes very hard for an 8 year old boy to answer. They really make them dig deep and often need an adult's help. This can be good or bad. I was trying to encourage a personal quiet time for my kids and if I wasn't looking over their shoulder sometimes they would give shallow answers because they were frustrated with their inability to dig."
5,Great book for children,Bought this as a gift for 8-year old grandson. Very pleased with content and learning activities. Should be a way to have fun while learning more about God's Word
5,Great devotional for boys.,I bought this for my nine year old son. I found it very age appropriate with good stories that help the child relate the specific Bible passage with their own life. I would definately recommend this book.
4,Boogie Down WithThis Book,"THE KING'S SWIFT RIDERMollie HunterHave you ever thought of being in the army in the medieval times, fighting for the Bruce, King of all Scott's? Well this is what happened to a boy named Martin. This book is about Martin fighting for the Bruce.I liked this book because I like knights and battles. I also like history about main events. One main event in the story is when the Scots killed thousands of English soldiers in one single castle!The moral to this story is to believe in yourself, have trust and do things for reasons, not just for fun. One example is being mean to somebody or something for no good reason. That is what the English did to the Scots. I think people who like history and war should read this book."
2,Read about a boy who becomes a knight.,"This book is about a boy who lived in the middle ages and wants to become a knight and fight for the king.I think this book is good if you`re a person that likes books about people from the middle ages.The book is slow at the beginning,but later in the book,probably in the middle, it starts geting better.A fantasy reader I think would probably enjoy this type of book."
3,Great musicians but a bit slow,"This came highly recommended. I bought it as a gift for my child who is a good drummer and has seen some of these musicians live. Unfortunately, we both felt the stars performed well but there was too much down time between numbers and great solos. Anotherwords, it dragged a bit and was slow. Better editing may have helped but I know many people want to see the whole performance. In conclusion, it was probably just a long performance -- the viewer just has to wait or search for the jewels."
1,Extremely disappointed !,I am extremely disappointed that this movie is only 16 minutes long ! What kind of a movie is 16 minutes long ! Going to try to return it . Not happy at all !
1,disappointing,"I was unsatisfied with the product. It was not worth even the 5 bucks I paid for it because of its length, but that is not the seller's fault. I should have read that before assuming it was longer. What is the seller's fault is that there were no glasses included. The DVD specifically says that it includes the red and blue glasses, but they were no where to be found. In addition, the disc was scratched and would keep skipping. Overall, I was not satisfied with what i received."
2,My dogs don't like it,"Well, I thought it would be a great dog food, but my dogs don't like it at all.I will go back to feeding Diamond Naturals--it's just as good quality, but at a cheaperprice, and my dogs love that food."
2,Ok,To many people die. I wish it was better. Not the best the series. It made me not want to read the next book. Zane died.awful and sorry for the spoiler alert.
4,Liked it a lot but not as much as the first two....,This was a great book overall. I was happy with the ending but I would have liked a little more details about the remaining characters. I don't want any spoilers in my review so I won't mention names but I'm a sucker for a good love story so of course I wanted a little more. It was a great trilogy and overall I really enjoyed it. It gets pretty crazy in this 3rd book but it all makes sense in the end. I was told by many not to bother with the 4th book called the Extras because it wasn't as good and it wasn't necessary to read because this was only meant to be a trilogy. So I took that advice. Only downside is that these books are not sold as a trilogy. You have to buy all 3 seperate and that was expensive. I still recommend the read.
1,"Had the same plot as ""Pretties""","This book had a very similar plot to ""Pretties."" Tally became something she didn't want to be, tries to fight it, etc, etc. I started to lose steam reading this book and eventually started to just skim pages. (Spoiler) I couldn't even muster any emotion to Zane dying. It seemed like Westerfield just wanted to be done with the love triangle. It also shows how poorly done his characterization was. By the time I started this book, I honestly didn't care what happened to any of the characters.Save your money and buy a book that's actually worth reading."
4,Specials,I liked this book. This book was very exciting I coulding put it down. I was always wondering what was going to happen next.
1,Don't waste your time,"This series is pretty famous in YA. I thought it was worth a read, but it's not. Tally changes personality from one book to the next. There's so many random things that don't connect and the pretty-speak drives me crazy. Not worth it."
1,"Terrible, terrible book","I was never really into this series. The final installment is however the worst of the 3. The writing is mediocre at best, the story is just stupid, and the ending? Piece of garbage."
5,Action Packed End to the Trilogy,"The Specials was the most action-packed of the first 3 in the Uglies Series. The writing and the pace moved along quickly, keeping you interested and maintaining your need to see how all of the characters from the first 2 books come together. You also begin to incorporate all three stories with the overlapping moral and ethical issues broached by Westerfeld, causing you ponder and reevaluating the plots and twists from the Uglies and the Specials. This one left me with the most unsettling feeling of the all the books, but all questions were answered and ends tied-up. I'm just not sure how I feel about society any more, especially living in Southern California where we are not to far away from this way of thinking. I would defiantly say you have to read all three to get the true feeling Westerfeld had intended and would give the overall series 5 stars. It was defiantly worth my time."
3,More of the same,"I don't mean to say anything bad about the books. I don't want to. The story is so compelling but the characters are pretty lackluster and lack depth. It hasn't changed a lot since the first book in the stories. Sorry. Great story but it lacks ""newness""."
3,Not His Best,"I'm usually a big fan of this author and his work, but there was just something about this one that didn't do it for me.A lot of times I felt like Mr. Nance is writing novels simply to show off his aviation knowledge. Yes, he's an expert, but I'm not and it's very confusing to try to follow a story where so much of it is wrapped up in technical talk. Trying to follow the storyline up in the airplane was next to impossible."
1,Got bored...not his best.,"I have read a number of Nance's books, and was looking forward to another enjoyable read. This one just didn't do it for me.Why? Because I felt the story line was just a little too far-fetched to be believable and for me, it just didn't move. I recommend reading some of his other stuff before this one.Yes, Mr. Nance has a great knowledge of aviation, and is able to demonstrate that, this just isn't his best showing.Also, as I have come to really appreciate the number of starts a book has as a gage of whether to pick up a book or not, I feel as if the 4.5 stars this title currently has is over rated.Thanks, MR"
3,"Excellent coffee table book but as a reference book, could be better","As my title indicates, this is an excellent coffee table book... colorful and full of information. To the avid collector however the book lacks the quality of a reference book. Without a index one has to page by page thumb through an entire section to find specific items."
1,disappointed,"Santa made a mistake bringing this gift. After setting everything up, we quickly realized the poor quality of this track. The cars went too fast to make it more than a few inches before flying off the track. Never made it close to a quarter of the way around the track, even after MANY attempts. Disappointing."
2,Outstanding? Not really.,"Fairly interesting material, but poorly written. As engaging as your local phone book. Heading back to True Crime books."
4,Good Cleaver and Cheap,Came very sharp out of the box and one solid piece of metal makes it very safe. However I am not sure if this has an effect but you can see where the handle and blade are welded together. It is very smooth to the touch and honestly for the price its expected to not look like a high end knife.As far as use goes I use it to open young coconuts which its great at and the solid piece constructions makes me feel comfortable whacking a coconut knowing the blade wont fly off the handle.
4,One part magic to one part common sense,This is an obscure but delightfully written collection of fantasy and fairy tales geared mainly toward adult readers although older teens with advanced reading skills may also enjoy it. The stories settings are as varied as the charactors and range from the middle ages to the future but all have a core grounded in the commonality of human behavior and relationship dynamics. In one story a young woman is married off to a less than desirable husband but finds a way into a solid relationship and understanding with her spouse using a bit of magic and a bit of common sense. In another a media personality is finally able to shed the burden of fame via something similar to a clone only to find that fleeting fame leaves a void that must be filled.If you enjoy the short fiction of Neil Gaiman; you will enjoy this.
2,"Microsoft Office Access 2003: Complete Concepts and Techniques, CourseCard Edition (Shelly Cashman Series)","I thought it would go further into depth regarding the use of objects, such as tabs, for instance. I was expecting a larger, more expanded explanation of objects ane their use in a business environment. I probably would not purchase the book had I known this information ahead of time."
1,Torn is getting REALLY sickning!!!!!!!!!,"TORN is so popular now, but she will be like the spice girls one day"
4,"Impressive debut, but need more efforts for next album","There is no denying that Natalie has a distinguished and impressive voice as 'Torn' prove it. I have heard of different 'Torn's sung by various musicians. No doubt that Natalie's is the best. She seems to be born for the song. But, it appears that she did not have much time in preparing her album after unexpected huge success of the single 'Torn'. I am afraid of her being a one-hit wonder. She will have to include a couple of songs as good as 'Torn' in her next ablum. Also, she needs more promotion in America. If Alanis has a song with airplays as much as 'Torn', she would sell more than five million copies with it alone. Anyway, there is no way to keep 'Torn' to you but to buy her album. 'Torn' will not be released as a single in America."
1,nothing special at all,"torn was a so-so song at best.her voice is ok.she is too much like Alanis Morissette,Ani Defranco,etc.. countless others.to the point it's cloned.the music sounds like everything else that is out their."
5,A totally blinding CD from start to finish - perfect!!,"This must one of my favourite albums ever - I play it constantly all the way through and enjoy every second of it. My favourite track on the album has to be ""Torn"" (track 1) which is also my favourite song ever!! I absolutely love this album and I believe that Natalie Imbruglia (easy for me to spell!) deserves to be commended. Roll on album number 2!"
1,One-hit Wonder,Angry girl-rock that constantly slips into cliches. Musically uninteresting. No hooks to be found.
2,You must be joking,"First of all, Natalie Imbruglia is NOT a female angst singer. In fact, this pampered Aussie wouldn't know angst if it were to bite her on her ""Formely of 'Neighbours'"" nose. She is nothing more than a pop vocalist ... and a very lacking one at that. What repulses me the most is that ""her"" #1 single, ""Torn"" was originally written (and performed much more effectively, I might add) by the band EdnaSwap. How Imbruglia could garner ""Best New Artist"" honors at the Grammy Awards is beyond me. To put it quite simply, this CD is boring. Maybe next album. Maybe next icon."
3,3.5 stars,"I'm not sure if I love this album or just don't really like it yet. Some of the songs are overpowered by crazy sound effects and Natalie's constantly pushing to give more power than she needs. I agree that some of the songs are awesome like 'Torn', 'Smoke' and 'Big Mistake' but I think she's capable of better."
5,One of the best TV shows ever,"Well I managed to get past the first few minutes. More precisely, I've seen the first eight seasons thus far. The agenda that really seems to drive this show is highly intelligent writing, stellar acting and first rate direction. Not for everyone though. Fans of American reality shows will probably have a hard time keeping up with this one."
3,Is it accurate?,"We have had this cute ,compact gauge in the ground for one year.It sits 7 to 10 ft. from two other gauges,one being the tall tube J.Deere type.They are all in open areas ,same side of the house,same elevation . The small one ALWAYS shows exactly double the amount of the other two gauges.How can this be right? We prefer to believe the little one, as we have a 27,000 gal.rain harvesting tank and in central Texas we treasure each drop! Anyone else have this happen?"
1,LET IT BE - The Naked Rip-Off,"I've been listening to the Beatles since 1964. I THINK I have Most of their stuff. It's probably impossible to have it all (even Paul McCartney is looking for a bootleg of John Lennon and him in L.A. circa 1974). ANYWAY, Let It Be - NAKED is well ... disappointing. If you already have a copy of Anthology 3 and or any of the GET BACK/LET IT BE bootlegs, don't bother. It's the same stuff. It was nice to hear a cleacn version of Don't Let Me Down (after all those years), but besides that .... It's a NAKED RIP OFF!! I understand Sir McCartney had a lot to do with this re-make. He's still upset that Phil Spector put strings over his sacred ""Long and Winding Road."" Well Paul, the devoted fans already had the pre-production mix and the rest of the people probably really don't care! [...]"
2,A pig with lipstick is still a pig,"According to the liner notes, ""Let It Be...Naked"" represents the album the Beatles intended to release. Perhaps this is why their original recordings gathered dust on the shelf and were not commercially released until the band had publicly disbanded. ""Let It Be"", most would agree, represents the nadir of the Beatles career in terms of songwriting and performance; even they themselves were so appalled with their work that they quickly reassembled and recorded ""Abbey Road"" which remains today as one of the finest recordings of all time.LIBN breaks no new ground; the unadorned recordings have long been available in bootleg form, and at just over 35 minutes running time it leaves the listener feeling short-changed. However, the digital technology has brought out nuances to the performances heretofore lost and, although the music is far below the Beatles' high standards, it is still better than 90% of today's popular music."
3,Another good for the collection........,"I saw this advertised,and thought WOW! ,like the CD was differentcuts of those great songs. Nope. I must say by reading the liner notes, it is a very clear,pleasant sounding ""remix"". ""The Long and winding Road"",sounded wonderful! The second disk I really wasnot impressed with. But I say listening to the Beatles as long as I have,buy it! I did compare my Let it Be cd to this and sure enoughit was pleasant to the ears!"
3,Untitled,"Sometimes knowing too much about the making of an album makes the listening experience less enjoyable. In this case, knowing how The Beatles felt about the original ""overproduction"" of the album brings this new release to novelty status at best.The stripped down songs make for one or two rounds of curious listening. Having grown up hearing them played a certain way, these versions will never replace the ones we've heard for over 30 years. But as we've all heard for so long that the band simply hated what Phil Spector did to the album, now we have the opportunity to hear how it was without his help.I think I still prefer the Spector version of The Long & Winding Road..."
5,Only the Beatles.,"Only the Beatles could have a different version of a 33 year old album released in 2003 and have it sell a million copies (in America alone) in record time... for any other recording act out there,it would be pure fantasy,for these guys,reality."
2,Not what I expected at all,I thought they would keep all the diologue in. Diologue gives the songs little funny moments and the orchrestra is excellent on the orignal. I give this 2 stars just because of the second disc which is excellent. If you could rate both discs separtly I would give disc 1 one star and disc 2 five stars. Also the songs played on the roof cut off really fast (espically One after 909) because the diologue was taken out.
3,Useless,"Apparently this is the ""cleaned up"" version of Let it Be. But I personally think it simply isn't worth it. Why? Because most, if not all, of these songs were released before. The versions of ""Get Back,"" ""Let it Be,"" and ""Don't Let Me Down"" that are presented here are the same versions used previously on various Greatest Hits compilations. ""The Long And Winding Road"" without strings was nice to hear, but it too was released on the Beatles Anthology Volume 3 in the mid '90s. The other tracks are great, but essentially the same as was heard on the 1970 ""Let it Be"" album.One can debate about whether or not it is nice to have the previously released tracks in one convenient place. As a longtime fan myself, however, I already had the other albums containing the same tracks long before this was released. So it really does little good for me."
4,Please read,"Well I'm sitting here listening to my new album to my Beatles collection.... Yes, some songs have been shortened and pieces have been a bit altered, however, if you would just sit down and listen to the music, you will admire it for what its worth. A true fan of the music doesn't compare its technical aspects. I might recommend a good set of headphones on a good system if you're listening to it alone. There's two cd's in the set. Cd #2 sounds more like an audition tape, but its really fun to listen to. You hear them collaborating on the album in the studio, goofing off and having fun. You hear John in the background going, ""you guys are always thinking of what we bloody could have done. Just play the f'n music."" Paul is heard, ""well if we do it this way, it might sound better."" It's fun. Just listen to the music and don't think of the technical junk. The music is still #1. Thanks again Paul for another piece of history."
1,This thing is horrific.,I've read a few reviews here where the mastering on this is actually praised. This is the absolute worst case of Sonic Solutions No-Noise sucking the life out of every instrument I've ever heard. Completely ridiculous. There is no dimension or space left. It all sounds completely unrealistic. I hope whoever butchered these recordings is not allowed anywhere near any future Beatle releases.
2,Boring retread.,"Not much new here folks. We've heard it all before. Some people have been saying that this is not a McCartney vanity project by contending that decisions like rearranging tracks and eliminating material is all the responsibility of EMI technicians. I find it extremely hard to believe that the idea to redo Let it Be the way Paul wanted was not Paul's idea to begin with. On the other hand, if those were EMI decisions and not decisions by members of the band, then how on earth can anyone claim that LIBN is a true representation of how the band intended LIB to be? You can't have it both ways."
2,Let it bomb,"LET IT BE - NAKED is a totally unnecessary album. The additional disc of studio chatter is a massive bore-- please don't waste a portion of your life listening to it.The original album, in spite of a few Spector overdubbed tracks, is just fine and about all one needs to hear from this ill-fated movie and concert project.Speaking of which, if Apple really cares about Beatles fans young and old (which I doubt), they should re-release the film of LET IT BE-- give it a short theatrical run, then follow that up with a home video product. LET IT BE is certainly not the greatest rock movie of all time, but it has a few fine moments. This movie is the REAL Let It Be Naked."
2,If it ain't broken...,"...don't fix it. I am that rare Beatles fan who considers the original LET IT BE to be their favorite effort by the Fab Four. The charm of that album is the relaxed, tossed-off vibe you get by listening to John Lennon making wise-acre remarks after songs and ditties like Maggie Mae and Dig It. With this album, the Beatles dropped their pretensions, let their guard down and wrote some charming and moving songs. I would say their most moving songs. Oddly enough, a lot of the tracks on the original LET IT BE sound more raw and ""naked"" than those on this new retread. I find that rawness to be a nice counterbalance to Spector's elaborate string arrangements. Anyone expecting LET IT BE...NAKED to sound dramatically different from the original should be forewarned: you're better off with what's been around for thirty five years."
5,"Better... Get This Version, Don't Bother With the Original","The old folks doing some of these reviews are way, way too picky about their precious Beatles.I'm 25 and I think the Beatles still deserve to be called the greatest band of the last century (that is, that completed their run within the 20th century). But what could be bothering them about this reworking of the Beatles' only mediocre album, except that they don't want to admit that it's an improvement?The nonsense is cut out, and the glam overproduction removed. The tracks flow better, the vocals are stronger (what fool would drown-out Beatles vocals? *cough**philspector**cough*).In short, if you haven't heard Let It Be yet (all you new Beatles fans), get the Naked version. You won't fall asleep, and you can even drive to it!And to you ""old school"" whiners... get over it. Anything that keeps the Beatles fresh & alive for a new generation, you should thank your lucky stars for it!"
4,Stellar Sound,"Many other reviews discuss the ""Spectorisation"" of three tracks, which is the most glaring difference between the original and this ""naked"" production. Personally, I like the orchestral versions better overall (sorry Paul).However, for those who appreciate clear, crisp sound, this remixed CD wins hands-down. I'm a former audio engineer, and am very impressed. The stereo aspect is also superior. The energy seems better, too.I just wish I could get the ""Spectorised"" cuts with this much clarity."
4,Doll house,"It was easy to put together, and is very appropriate for energetic toddlers. Our only issue are the measurements - it does not fit on a regular-sized children's table, so we've had it either on the floor or coffee table."
5,Perfect dollhouse!,"My daughter loves this dollhouse. Two years and many additions later (all wooden accessories by Plan Toys), she still plays with it all the time, and it looks as good as the day we bought it. It is such an improvement on the flashy but cheap plastic dollhouses available as companions to the various TV and Disney characters out there. The only drawback - plan ahead if you plan to buy additions around Xmas time, they go out of stock quickly!"
1,Wouldn't play on my system,"I also got an error message saying, ""check your tv system"" - so disappointed, as it was a Christmas gift."
1,don't buy,"i have been trying to play this game with my four year old, and it is very frustrating. erika moves oh-so-slooooooooooow, it takes forever to get her to walk across a room. then, you must do the activities in order---if my little girl wants to ""find the kitten"", she has to start the entire game over to do it. same for ""baking a cake"", and all the other activities. you can't just click on something and do it.all in all, it's very aggravating."
3,Those other reviewers must work for the Matrix,"The Mooney Suzuki are great, don't get me wrong, but the new CD is far from their best work. In fact, the best is still their first. If I had never heard anything from them, and heard this, I would like it, but I would not be blown away like I was with the last 2, or seeing them live. Hardcore fans of the Suzuki are almost all going to be universally dissapointed - witness the 50 used copies already available on Amazon. The guitars and vocals are toned down, backup vocals and special effects are up. Kind of like they used to be the Ramones, and now they are The Sweet. I like 'em both, but we all know which band really rules. Buy at your own risk, go see 'em live, and let's hope they skip the Matrix for the next one."
3,Detailed analysis,"The authors have traced the break up of Yugoslavia in exhaustive detail. There is a 9 page list of characters involved, including presidents, chief's of staff, military leaders, leaders from the EC and UN. etc. Necessary unless one has a better memory than I for Yugoslave names. They trace the scheming of Slobodan Milosevic to build an independent Serbia. The duplicity is chilling. As journalists they quote sources, so documentation for their comments is excellent. Because of the detail, it is not an easy read, but if one wants to trace the development of the conflict and its sad outcome, this is your book."
3,Boilerplate Fiction,"I picked up this book without really knowing anything about the author, and without really reading the book jacket description. It was ok, not great; readable, but not special. I found the entire plot to be a bit ""over the top,"" and very predictable (and very forgettable). I won't rule out picking up another David Morrell book, but I also won't seek one out."
5,Phenomonal Suspense!,"I have been a fan of David Morrell for over a year, and he continues to excel. He is undoubtedly one of the top three suspense novelists today"
2,What a crock!,The author must have greased his palms before he churned out this pot-boiler. It was long-winded and predictable at every turn. Every major character was challenged merely to loom up out of the pages in two dimensions.
5,Great book! Great escapist fun!,A great action thriller. Period. Good characters. Great action. The plot contains wonderful twists and turns as the reader discovers who the real bad guys are. This would make an awesome movie!
3,Bosch I-Pod Dock,"Would not make this purchase again. The adaptor for the I-Pod ""Nano"" is diametrically opposed to the input on the unit. As a result, the adaptor is useless, leaving the I-Pod loose and difficult to set. Also, the window on the Dock falls out constantly, leaving the Dock open to sawdust, etc."
3,Ipod Dock for Bosch Radio,"Works but causes a loud feedback hum on the Bosch radio resulting in a less than quality sound. Somewhat overpriced but does solve the problem of protecting your Ipod. From a convience standpoint,would probably purchase again."
5,The Best Intro. Ever!,"I might sound biased, but who doesn't? Enderton's book is the BEST introduction out there if you want to learn. There are better books for conciseness or pendanticalness, what a word :(. But, he introduces the material in such a way that the novice can actual absorb most of it in one go through. It's deep enough that a return trip through a difficult chapter is worth your time. After reading this text you can easily segueway to Moschovakis's book, ""Notes on Set Theory"" or even attempt books like ""Set Theory An Introduction To Independence Proofs (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics)"" by Kunen.This book covers all of the basics of set theory (greater in scope than Halmos's ""Naive Set Theory"" (which is a great book by the way))."
1,"""Hannah Montana"" Copies Off of ""That's So Raven""!!!!","That's So Raven is way better than Hannah Montana.I mean, Raven actually is hilarious, is a great actress, and can sing.Miley Cyrus, on the other hand, can't act that good. She is an OK singer, she can only sing Rockish Alternative Pop music because her voice is so raspy.Hannah Montana copies off of That's So Raven in these ways:1. About a pop star, who keeps it a secret from everyone, but her family knows she is Hannah Montana. (Raven is psychic, only her family and friends know. It's a secret from everyone else.)And, that's the biggest CLUE, that Hannah Montana is copying straight off of That's So Raven. Which is still Disney Channel's only show to have 100 episodes.Plus, Hannah Montana's viewers have gone down to 2 million every new episode.It music suck, because That's So Raven drew in over 3 million viewers every episode, and gets 1.8 million viewers on ABC Kids on Saturday Morning.NOW THAT'S TALENT!!!"
2,Great...for awhile,"After a couple of washes in the machine, this ripped up pretty badly. We haven't had any problems with any of our other hooded towels for our little girl, so I'm doubtful that this was the fault of the washer/dryer."
2,"Yuck. Tastes like sawdust. No, really.","I purchased this product and have tried it in a few recipes such as pancakes and brownies, as well as simply cooking it with oat bran.The strong sawdust-like taste is very difficult to mask. I've thrown out everything I've made with it so far because the flavor was just a bit too strong.This product is best used as only a very small fraction of whatever it is used in, but on the whole I would look to more palatable sources of fiber.For a better tasting fiber for bulky baked items, defatted coconut flour has a much better taste and having the ability to be used as a much, much greater proportion in a recipe."
5,"another point of view about the meaning of the word ""freedom""","Wonderful film, worth seeing indeed.The best character, I think, of Nick Nolte.Based on the french novel ""L'adieu au roi"" of Pierre Schöndorfer, who fought in Indochine; the novel itself, as far as I know, is based on a true story.It shows us another meaning of the sense of freedom during WW II."
1,Utterly worthless,"I literally could not get past the first line of this book without finding glaring errors.""Marijuana is the second most popular drug after alcohol in our country today."" (Baum, Page 1)Aside from being a hopelessly clumsy sentence, this statement ignores caffeine and tobacco, which are respectively, psychoactive and narcotic substances."
4,I found my way into java!,"I had only some experience with programming before, but feared that JAVA should be a bit tricky to get the hang on. But this book comes with great examples that gets you going creating rather useful (when put together) JAVA applets. I'm only curious about a bug in one of the examples(lame). A good buy if you never programmed JAVA or C++ before. T.Andersson (sweden)"
2,Wild Animals I Have Known,"This is a reprinting of a book of wonderful stories by Ernest Thompson Seton. But buyer beware. The publisher has excluded all 200 of the author's sketches and drawings that help the stories come alive for both younger and older readers. In addition, the design of the book is amateurish. Type is spread across the page, with extra spaces between paragraphs, nothing like the pleasing style of the original editions. This is a lifeless shadow of an American classic."
3,Wild Animals I Have Known,This book was in my opinion not a good reprint of the original book. I have never seen the original but have seen pictures of it.
5,Wonderful,"I thought this was an excellent account; I didn't know what type of reading it would be but found I could not put it down. I have long been curious about the women and children who DID survive the sinking of the Titanic. This tells us in a lovely way how these traumatized humans coped with such a devastating loss, especially since we always heard they were reluctant to speak of that event."
3,Midnight Bayou,"The premise of the book was great, typical Nora Roberts. I found the ending to be disappointing. It really didn't tie all the characters (present and past) together. Very good read, just a disappointing ending."
5,A must for all Nora's fans!!!,"This is Roberts at her best!Even though I've been a fan for years, this book sat on my shelf for a week - I'm not into ghost stories and only bought it because I've read almost all her books and didn't want to skip one. The moment I've started to read it, though, I couldn't let it go. The characters are amazing - living or dead! This is one of my favorites, no doubt about it. Highly recommended!!!!!!"
1,Seriously?,"I've read and enjoyed almost all of Nora Robert's books. Midnight Bayou, however, was a huge disappointment. I loved the book up until about the last 20 pages. Then it seemed as if Nora handed the manuscript to someone else and said ""here, you finish it"", someone who didn't understand the characters' personalities or the depth of the story.Hopefully this is not a sign of things to come with Mrs. Roberts."
3,Great for Halloween!,"I picked this up because it was based in New Orleans, had a old mansion, Cajun atmosphere. It was different. I hope future Nora books do not delve again and again into the paranormal. Solution was vague. The two stories were ok and it was a good enough book to read at Halloween time. Finished it while waiting for the trick or treaters to end their prowls."
3,pissed off,"I love this author ...however, the story just ended abruptly! So much build up and it. Just. Ended. I was so upset. Still am. I got so caught up in these characters only to be let down. Big disappointment."
2,Midnight Bayou,"This story takes place in the present, but also in the past. Delcan Fitzgerald is drawn to a house in New Orleans called Manet Hall, but he really doesn't understand why. He just knows that since he first saw it in college, he would own it someday. He gets strange vibes from the house, and when he meets Angelina, they intensify. Together they go on the 100 year old journey to find the answers to the strange happenings within Manet Hall.While I generally like ghost stories with the paranormal added to the mix, this went beyond the scope of what I can take. The rebirth and reincarnation of characters was just too far out in left field for me. I normally like Nora Roberts books, but this is one I couldn't get into."
3,So-So,"I am a faithful fan of Nora Roberts, but found this novel severely lacking in depth and believability. Paranormal elements seem to run through many of her novels, as do men and women with Irish backgrounds, but it's getting old already. Simple things in the story (like the ruby/diamond ring) were left unfinished, and the ending was completely rushed and phony. Plus, are we really supposed to believe that an Ivy-league lawyer doesn't speak in complete sentences? The characters' thoughts were fragmented, as was the writing, and it's disappointing to watch Nora Roberts sacrifice quality for quantity these days. Midnight Bayou is still enjoyable, but is not Roberts at her creative best."
4,Exciting yet ....,I have to admit. I was hesitant when I bought this book. Than I could not put it down. I would read when ever I could. I just had to get to the ending...than poof. It fizzled. It seemed Mrs.Roberts was tired of writting the book than just ended it abruptly. It was like reading the end of a Harlequin Romance. The obligated chapters were set in place. Time to emd it and send it in.I did indeed love the story. But the ending was rather abrupt. I felt it left loose ends.
2,Disappointing!,"I am an avid Nora Roberts fan and have every single one of her books including the ones she writes under ""JD Robb."" By far, this is my least favorite of ALL her books and she has written many. I was very disappointed with this. I felt the characters were rather dull and cliche and I did not care for the ""ghost"" theme. However, everyone has an ""off"" day, and I am anxiously awaiting her next novel..."
1,MIDNIGHT ...,"This was one of THE WORST books that I have read all year. It had got my attention because of my love of New Orleans and period piece books, but this was just awful. The first seven pages had me in disbelief that a well known author could write something soawful. It was like she woke up and decided to write about southern plantation life and reincarnation-without doing any research. Everything was so obvious in the first chapter, she included the typical idea of people of the south are usually portrayed; with balls and slaves! I wouldn't recommend this book, if you want to read a romace stick to Daniel Steel!"
5,Special K Cereal,This product has been excellent for portion control. My husband is dieting and eats one small box every morning with 1% milk. He is losing weight!! The case of 70 serving boxes is convenient to pull from daily. The small packs also are easy to pack when we are traveling. Calories are low particularly with this size. We are really pleased with this choice of cereal!
5,Full circle by janet Baker,Very well written. Fast informative read. Gives great insight into a wonderful person and her world of music.
4,Best of Both Worlds,"This is a great flick. A mixture of ""A Chorus Line"" and ""Dirty Dancing."" If you love to dance, this is a perfect choice."
3,Great Dance Sequences,"Great Dance sequences overcome weak script. The acting is solid for the most part, but Donna Murphy as a dance instructor steals the movie. The dance sequences are well choreographed and directed. If you love dancing, this is the movie for you."
3,Great Movie :) Cruddy DVD :(,"My best friend bought me a VHS copy of Center Stage a few years ago, and since then I have worn it out watching it on rainy saturdays and at 'chick' parties. Tonight I purchased the DVD, specifically for the deleted scenes the 'making of' featurette and the directors commentary. I WAS SOOOOOOO DISAPPOINTED! The commentary consisted mostly of ""...errr...umm...err...yes...good dancers...errr...yes....see that...um...."" And there were only two deleted scenes, when I know there has to be more. And the featurette was pure crap. I was expecting (that's what I get for expecting!) interviews and footage of rehearsals, etc. What you get is an extended version of the trailer. So, if you're thinking of upgrading to the DVD simply for the special features, don't bother. The only special feature on this DVD is the movie itself."
4,Great Dancing Outweighs Poor Acting,"This movie is great! I own it and I've watched it so many times! If you are looking for a great storyline and/or acting, however, rent it and see how you like it before making this purchase. I thought that the acting was pretty bad and unimportant lines were way overdone, but the dancing was EXCELLENT. The smallest movements of the dancers were well-choreographed. This is especially a great movie for fans of the well-sculpted male. Just check out ""Charlie""--a fine dancer...from ANY angle! Enough said."
5,Wonderful,At first I didn't think I would like this movie. But my daughter is the one that got me to watch it and it is great. There still are lessons to be learned and this movie has a few in it. It just comes to show you are never to old to learn something from the younger kids today either.
1,Next time get some real actors,"This movie could have been really cool. I loved the dancing. But please!!! You are supposed to use ACTORS to act, not dancers. Granted, some people can do both. Wouldn't it have been great if they had found some. Also, the plot and script are much too 'soap opera!' I think my favorite part of the movie was the previews!"
5,Different Times,All of Mary Jane Holmes books were written at the turn of the century and reflect the times in which she wasliving. This was an excellent read. I highly recommend all of her books.
2,Not the item shown or described.,"This Bow Eye is not the one shown in the photo or as described. The threaded stud only extends out 2-3/4"". It will cost me more for some good quality all thread to replace the supplied stud than I wanted to spend on the whole thing."
3,3an a half stars...,"well it being sunday .... first of all unmder the circumstances ...we are somewhat satisfied but can you send us by email ""im so young and love me like u used to ""we purchased both songs an they were somewhat disrupted an circled like cu4rly ... i mean slightly imperfectenated ,you know skippy, like us being kniuckleheads we arent sure yet what to do ...but refreshing the memory."" so young by the beach boys."" an ""love us like we used to"" by tanya tucker country an rock softly ...males &females...;by shdfh..."
4,great for beginners,"I teach basic and color photography. One of my students let me borrow her copy of the original(1989). One problem in explaining aperture, shutter speed, and depth-of-field is that photos would really help. This book does that, as well as having photos that address loading the film, types of lenses, light, and use of flash. Yes, there are people out there that don't know how to load film. Although modern cameras may have electronic gizmos to deal with aperture and shutter speed, this book helps the understanding of how everything works, as all cameras do the same thing."
5,Heavy Duty,Used this shower head today. It has a very nice range of settings.It also seems very well made. It's NOT some plastic piece of crap.It installed very easily.
4,A Good Resource,"For good and bad, this is a fairly high level, introductory back. It talks more about the concepts of OOP much more than the implementation."
4,From the director...,"Please bear in mind that this is a short film. It's not intended to be a complete film.Interestingly enough, we're actually developing a full-length feature based on this short, so we'll see what happens. Hope you enjoy this!ThanksDallas Jenkinswww.jenkins-entertainment.comdallas@jenkins-entertainment.com"
1,What a disappointment!!!,"I was SHOCKED at this DVD! It had a brief intro and gave some credits. I was HONESTLY waiting for the movie to start, but, in fact, it was OVER!!! I couldn't believe it! I put it in again and tried to ""play the whole thing."" That's when we discovered we had watched THE WHOLE THING!In the beginning, I thought it was going to be a movie I would enjoy. I have seen other movies that show you a little bit of the story before giving the credits, so I didn't think anything of it when it didn't start with the credits. However, when the credits were shown a few minutes after the movie started, I truly expected the story to continue. Was I flabbergasted when it became apparent that the story was not going to continue. I honestly thought it was a defect in the DVD. After reviewing it one or two times, I discovered it was actually made that way!I would never sell this to anyone. I had to throw it away."
5,This movie gets you thinking,"While I watched ""Midnight Clear"" I kept thinking, ""Okay. So what?"" or ""What's going on here?""I found it confusing -- at first. But I was hooked from the first scene. Why is this guy called Lefty? And who is the elderly woman who dumps a whole bag of catfood onto her porch?The ending blew my mind. I've thought about this movie many times since I first watched it. It will get you thinking about how you treat strangers, and how you treat your family."
2,a disaster waiting to happen,"Hi all, I just wanted to warn anyone wanting to purchase this camera that if you have any kind of an active lifestyle, this camera is not for you. I bought this and was extremely happy with it until I took it on a trip, and still taking very good care of it somehow got a tiny bit of sand in it...no I did not put it in the sand, I am talking about sand comming off my body and going into the lense area...anyway it is completely broken now and to fix it will almost cost the price of a new one! I have now heard others stories about the durability of this camera that is not involving sand....sure it has a great price for so many good features, but it will die fast if you do very much with it. stear away, pay more for a more durable camera with the features you want"
1,Useless,"This camera has no optical finder. Its display screen is unreadable in bright sunlight, thus can leave you with no finder at all.In effect, a hundred or so years of photogrpahic technology have left us with a camera that, when it comes to framing a shot, is no better than the view cameras of old, which had to be placed on a tripod with their ground glasses viewed under a black cloth.I returned mine."
1,A real problem,"After doing a bunch of research, I bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective Sony CCD that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had. The first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations. After a few days of that, the camera dies completely. The second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease. One camera . . . a fluke maybe. But two? That suggests a real problem so beware."
1,"Horrible, broke in the middle of Europe trip","DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! Mine broke on my trip to Europe in the middle of taking a picture. And no I didn't drop it. I had only used it twice before and Panasonic customer service was not at all helpful. I am going with the more trusted brand of Sony from now on. After my dealing with Panasonic, I will not buy another camera or other from them."
5,under harsh condition,"I purchased this camera during my deployment in Iraq. It's very compact with excellent zoom capability. The rotary menu selection is easy to use with multiple options and settings. I especially love the sharp 2"" LCD screen, great on view my shots and videos. It has faced both hot & cold climate (yes it does get cold on December in Iraq), sandstorms, and of course my abuse. In all cases my camera performed above and beyond it's call of duty. One note: If you're living in a very sunny area, I suggest to buy an LCD shade/cover."
3,"eh, its alright","Wow I have to say this is one boring CD. . . Theres an occasional catchy riff or two interspersed throughout a song. Its just so repetative! There just isn't enough variety between the songs and in the songs themselves. Maybe I'm to picky? I don't know but I listened to the whole CD again just so I could edit my review and make it better. I still hold the same opinion that 1184 was lightyears better and this CD is just boring. I'll even add another thing thats bad about this CD, it totally lost its appealing atmosphere were it just drew you in like in 1184. Whatever. . .My favorite songs are Fagning, and Resurrection of the Wild.I have to say that I think 1184 was better in everything. The keyboards were complex and beautiful. The guitar work further added to that and made it seem powerful. The screaming even added to that amazing music already and made it seem intense. Thats just my opinion, most don't agree it seems, hehe. oh well"
1,A real toad!,This book can be the most commercially successful book of poetry to be ever published if it were used as a cure for insomniacs. Mr. Lehman writes interminably boring lines which ultimately put this reader (and many others) to sleep.-Lucy Greely
5,"Remove from ""Eye Problems"" category","This is not a book about ""Eye Problems"" and should be removed from the ""Eye Problems"" category."
5,"Very, very good","Too many times people want a commentary of Revelation to actually be a speculation. Much of what the book of Revelation means is actually unclear, but people are prone to pretending they know what it means. This book does not do that. Hindson clearly portrays what may be portrayed and steers away from conjecture.I was extremely impressed by his treatment of the Church at Laodicea, as he did not fall into the ""God would rather have you be on fire for God or so far from him than to be a moderate Christian"" modern reading of the passage. Instead, Hindson uses cultural context to show the Hot and Cold in the passage refers to usefulness and the source of the water.That is just one example of Hindson's ability to get to the heart of the matter."
2,"Opinions, not rules","It is a bathroom read detailing the opinion of a selected few, not a read I would pass down to my son. Maybe 10% of it is actual rules, the rest can be ignored. A more entertaining and useful read is ""The complete Lifes little instructions book"" by Jackson Brown."
5,A real shower arm,This shower arm is great! Nice finish and solid construction. It adds an elegant look to your shower while also raising and extending the showerhead from the wall. I loved it so much I bought another for my other bathroom.
5,Moen Shower Arm,"A little pricey but it's everything we wanted. Mated it to the Moen 8"" rain shower head and we now have spa showers every day. Couldn't be happier with product, from shipping to installation."
3,Not great for stall type showers,"This shower head was paired with the Moen S6320 Velocity Two-Function 8-Inch Diameter Rainshower Showerhead (also purchased through Amazon).On the positive side, the chrome finish matches the moen showerhead perfectly and looks nice.On the negative side, my biggest problem with this showerhead is that the bend in the arm does not position the showerhead perpendicular to the ground - it is roughly at a 40 degree angle. For longer showers (over a bathtub for instance) this probably would not be a big deal, however since my shower is a stall type, I have to stand very close to the wall rather than in the center of the shower."
3,A classic sailing story,"This book is of interest not only as an account of an interesting solo sea voyage, but also because of its historical perspective. Slocum was the first person to sail alone around the world in the late 1800's. His boat, equipment, methods, prejudices, language and writing style reflect that era. The book left me with a mental image of Slocum as an undoubtedly skilled seaman, but a dour and humourless sod. Some of his claims about the capabilities of his boat ""Spray"" tend to challenge credibility. Still, not a bad read."
4,A great adventure,"My feeling, upon finishing this book, was that I wish I'd had the opportunity to meet this remarkable man. What a great story of adventure as Slocum sets out in the Spray to sail solo around the world. He seems to have such a wonderful attitude about the whole thing, never really taking anything too seriously, but just enjoying the whole epic. It is incredible that this was done way back in 1895, long before the sophisticated navigational aides sailors and yachtsmen have available today. Yet, he seems to almost casually find his way around the world, meeting interesting people, avoiding mishaps and just generally having a great time. His writing is simple and a joy to read. It's a wonderful story for all ages and certainly not surprising that it has been so popular over the years."
3,"Drawings, Maps & Illustrations are missing","I enjoyed the book, but when purchasing I missed the fact that the book didn't contain any illustrations because the publisher used OCR software. I really wanted to have that additional information as I read this book."
4,What a Terrific Debut Novel--Loved it!,"Having read all T. Jefferson Parker's current novels and loving them, I decided to check out his earlier stuff. Laguna Heat arrived and I started it late one afternoon. Immediately, I was drawn into the storyline; but, even more importantly, I was drawn into the mind and character of Tom Shephard. What a well-developed character Parker has given us here. So much is going on in the life of the former-LA cop...trying to live with a righteous shooting from his early-cop days and coping with a new position and murder spree in his hometown, quiet Laguna Beach. And all his father's old friends are involved someway. Too, he is dealing with the heartbreak of divorce, hanging on for dear life. This was just a great read and one I'm so glad I found. I'm only sorry that some of the other early Parkers are out of print and I can't get them. T. Jefferson Parker has become one of my favorite mystery writers and I look forward to starting his latest, Red Light."
3,legacy,"The book was good. It was not what I thought it was going to be. I thought it was more of a scientific discovery, history type book. I didn't realize it was a novel. Although it did keep me interested."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"BRETHREN, PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HOME MADE VIDEO! IT IS ATROCIOUS!!"
2,An Education Of A Dog Lover,"Sadly I couldn't finish this film. The drawings and animation were great but I just couldn't stomach any more scenes of doggy bodily functions or the resentment of Tulip's owner of having to pick up after his dog. Maybe if I were more of a dog lover I would've found this to be interesting. Having said that I have enjoyed dog and owner type movies in the past like ""Turner and Hooch"" for example, which is about a guy having to adjust to having a gregarious type dog. But this movie was just too much!"
5,Outstanding Pet/Baby gate!!! Exactly what I needed!,This gate was exactly what we were looking for for our stairwell that leads to the basement! We wanted a baby gate that secured to the wall but also wanted it to work with our cats. We have a small calico and a very large Maine Coon cat (22 lbs.) and they are able to go through the gate with ease while keeping my daughter from going down the steps...I would highly recommend this gate to anyone with pets or pets and a baby!
1,Gift for daughters new apartment.,"After one washing of the pearl grey towels, they are ruined :( They look as if they were washed with bleach. Terrible streaks running through them. Now they can not be used if guests are coming over. Its true, you get what you pay for. I will replace these with a better product. I gave this product one star because that was the least allowed, but it should get zero stars."
3,Night Moves missing Op Center feel,"Some may call Night Moves the less-than-expected sequel to Clancy's Op Center series. For those who enjoy Clancy's precison detail to technical issues, this book glazed over some action that could have been better elaborated on. Night Moves was more black and white when it came to ""good vs. bad,"" without the strata of conflict his characters often face. The only exception was the personal conflict characters like Toni and Alex face, which may make this an excellent read for those who felt a little intimidated by Clancy's previous works."
2,Interesting storyline that could have been given more time,"The idea of the computer-world being brought to it's knees is an intriguing one. This novel, however, doesn't begin do it justice.I didn't find the characters as well-rounded as other characters that have shown up in Clancy novels, but it could have happened if the writing team had devoted more pages to the book allowing the necessary details that weren't there. Does every female have to be drop-dead gorgeous and every male fantastic in the use of guns?Unfortunately the plot suffers a lack of detail as well.I rated it two stars because I did finish the book in just a few days, but it was not nearly the riveting read that Executive Orders and others were."
1,Inane Dialogue,"This is a poorly crafted excuse for an F.B.I. story. It reads more like a Disney story written for teens and tweens, with the implausibly snappy dialogue completely inappropriate to this genre... or to any book an adult might read.I struggled to chapter 3, but the goofy character interactions and dialogue have defeated me. I'd rather read any of the beautifully written John Sanford books I've already read than subject myself to another paragraph of this book's nonsense."
2,"Cheesy dialogue, poor plot","Even though I love the Savich/Sherlock series--this one was terrible. The romance/flirting between the 2 sub-characters was so lame. The dailogue was cheesy. And the plot left you wishing there had been one. The sub plot was hardly mentioned throughout the horribly long interviewing of suspects and then when it did come up again in the end, it was wrapped up quickly and with no substance. The main plot was a huge let down."
1,Really Bad!,"A terrible read. A computer determined who the killer was, from out of the blue, with no explanation to the reader. Likewise I was waiting for a tie-in between the supernatural portion of the story which appeared at the beginning of the book but there was no relationship between the ghost of the woman Samantha Barrister, her family, and the rest of the story. Very juvenile, not at all thought out in a logical manner. It was a page turner, keeping me in suspense as I waited for some coherence, which, unfortunately, never came."
3,go for vol.2,vol.2 is by far much better maybe the song selection is better or maybe vol.1 is a warm up. but vol.2 will not dissapoint bluegrass-dead head fan
3,"Interesting, but should have been more creative","The concept behind this CD is an exciting one - arranging Grateful Dead songs for a bluegrass band. Unfortunately, many of the arrangements aren't very creative and tend more toward Muzak than Monroe. The great exceptions are the first two cuts - a stunningly beautiful ""Althea"" and a fun ""Scarlet Begonias."" Maybe they just chose too many slow songs, or maybe it's the countrified electric guitar on several songs (esp. Truckin') that bothers me. Tape the first two songs from someone else and save your money for Dick's Picks."
3,Worth a Look (Maybe),"""Intruders"" is generally well-made: Good acting, script, cinematography, arresting scenery, etc. It's definitely something different, with touches ofPan's Labyrinth, though nowhere near as good as that film. Yet, the whole storyline has that same half-baked, fragmented feel that we get from so many films these days. Suspenseful at times, with some genuinely harrowing scenes, as well as some clever and surprising tie-ups. In the end, though, the whole feel of ""Intruders"" is draggy and repetitive. It just didn't play itself out and take me anywhere really interesting. Although some mystery is always nice, a little more revelation of who/what the ""monster"" is supposed to be--and how it came to be-- would be helpful.I can see why some like (or dislike) it more than I do, but I cannot see why anyone would find ""Intruders"" a truly special and rewarding film."
2,Not for a toddler,"This is not big enough for a toddler, the back rest is not tall enough to support a toddlers head. Also I don't like the footreast flap. Otherwise it is a great buy. I guess if your child stays small it would be a great stroller."
2,for beginners only,"if you have any experience or just general knowledge of meditation techniques then this book is not for you. But if you are new to meditations and would like a generalized understanding of the various types then it may be enlightening for you, but expect to have to buy another book to grasp a true understanding of any particular meditation covered in these pages. the book might help you narrow down to a particular type of meditation that would enhance your life, but do not expect it to teach you anything helpful. Find another source for that."
5,Savage Tales of Solomon Kane,"I have read other Robert E. Howard books, but had not really noticed Solomon Kane until I began hearing about the movie that was being made about him. The book is beautifully written. The details are superb. The reader is transported to the side of Kane as he moves from adventure to adventure. Wish he had written more."
5,really strange stuff,I saw this film back in the late 80's and boy it sure was some werd and wild things going on overthere. Ithink everyone that sees this will injoy it.
2,Broken during shipping,"The bulbs that survived the trip appear to be working just fine, but there were a lot of little bulb shards to clean up upon arrival."
2,Broken when received,Although these bulbs were solidly packed in bubble wrap and arrived boxed with other unbroken bulbs these bulbs were all broken to bits when received. They were so broken that when I pulled off the bubble wrap small pieces of glass were falling out of the package so I did not even bother to open the package and just re-wrapped them and sent them back. Second set after return arrived all in one piece. Still not sure about ordering light bulbs by mail....
4,It's just a matter of price,"If you aren't paying shipping, you can figure the cost/ounce as well as the next person."
4,;0),"This is a cute little movie that I personally enjoyed. When you think of Andy Griffith you think of him as the whole some guy that you watched in his earlier work but I didn't mind seeing him in this film it shows a different side of him and why not he is much older as well as an accomplish actor so sometimes you can do a film that you think would be fun. It's basically about a guy whose grandfather is in a retirement home and the guy is trying to show him how to get back in the game of dating if that's what you want to call it, while doing this the grandson is trying to win this girl over that he likes with the same tricks he is showing his grandfather but it isn't working."
1,Disappointing,This movie was offensive to us. We only watched it for a short time. We ended up putting it in the trash.
2,"No Longer Trance, and a long trip from what it used to be","With a title like ""From Trance to Progressive"" you would believe that the songs on this CD would take the flowing euphoric/melodic trance that made the previous works great and add to it with more progressive sounds. Sadly, on this album progressive seems to mean one-hit ""trance-pop"" wonders like dogzilla, with catchy vocal tracks, a repeated chorus, and unnecessary breakdowns instead of melodies. Fans of Armin Van Buuren's weekly radio show A State of Trance will probably enjoy this CD, but any fans of the older A Trip in Trance compilations will find it shallow and wanting."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable and gripping.,"Greg Iles shows his writing talent in Mortal Fear, with excellent character development and intelligent insight into human relationships. In my opinion the novel could have been another 600 pages longer and I would have loved it."
4,really holds interest,really holds interest even though serial killers have been doneto death. The ending is a hoot. The reader should get a great laughout of the climatic scene where the serial killer surrounds the house and the wife strips in order to entice the killer. Tres hilarious.
3,Good but somewhat dated,"Good plot but much too much computerese, even at the time it was written. Now, it's just dated computerese. Iles draws believable characters and a good plot."
5,Mortal Fear a Winner!,"Completely unlike his former two outings, Greg Iles has hita home run with Mortal Fear. A techno-thriller par excellence, this is one you will not be able to put down. From the cotton fields of the Mississippi Delta Greg Iles weaves a riveting tale about the rancid underbelly of a sexual oriented bulletin board system and those who would use it to further their own strange agendas. A must read!"
1,"Love Greg Iles, could not like the main character","I am a Greg Iles fan but was sorely disappointed with this one. I could neither like nor identify with the central character and had almost no interest in the plot, which did not keep me on edge like Iles books normally do. Iles did a terrible job of keeping the sub-plots together with the plot on this one - I looked at the date published and thought: this must have been an earlier work, therefore he is forgiven but I consider this one a waste of money!"
4,Comfort,I found this book less rewarding than his first two efforts if only because the subject material made me feel less comfortable. Perhaps that is the highest recommendation I can give the book.
3,"Too Long, Too Predictable, and Not very belivable.","I enjoyed reading this novel but It was a little to drawn out for it's own good. There were sections where I couldn't wait to get to the next page, but many times I was let down by that very next page. Some part's were a little too predicatable and at other's not very believable. This may be because my line of work is the same as the central character. It was good but it was not great. I think that some of the reviews on this page are a little too kind. If you have nothing else. . .enjoy."
5,Great Plot,"Mortal Fear is a very well crafted thriller novel. We get a great plot filled with different ""plot bombs"" that Greg Iles plants and we can't wait for them to explode. The love triangle angle is well done. And the online chat dialogue is too good to miss!Read it!"
4,another good read,"This is the second book by Iles I have read, the first being Black Cross. While this effort does not come close to being in the same league as that book, it is quite a good, stimulating read. It is written in the first person, which can take some time to get used to.Iles tries to add flourishing touches of human emotions into the book's sub-story, but the characters are mostly shells. Thomas H Cook is quite good at this, and I wonder if Black Cross was written after Mortal Fear, because Iles' characters in that book were much better.This is a long book, but reads quickly. It is not really a true serial murder mystery because the killer does not fit into that mold, but it does have some interesting plot twists and suspense.While it is no Red Dragon or Silence, it is fun to read."
3,a good read if you're stuck sitting somewhere for a while,"this book came to me highly recommended, so it was a little disappointing. after reading it, i can't quite figure out why the author threw in the whole eros component. the service itself doesn't make much sense (there's lots of free internet porn out there, and if you're living with someone who's that possesive they'll probably catch on to you either way). it seems like the only people who would really be interested in it are famous people. and i don't understan why the killer went through such pains to stalk people on eros. surely there's an easier way for a doctor to get organs. for the first few practice surgeries why not just use homeless people? it doesn't matter if they have aids if it's only practice. and he didn't use the service to find the real donors anyway. i also didn't have much sympathy for the main characters. all in all, it wasn't bad, but i didn't think it was very plausible either."
3,One for two,"(I bought this at PetSmart) My two cats (12 and 14) couldn't be bothered with this - I thought it was cute, but they were utterly bored with it, and never played with it, so I gave it to my sister, who has three fairly young cats. They thought it was fabulous, according to her, although I've not seen them bat it around when I'm over there. It is harder to interest older cats in play, but they still pounce on each other and love jumping into boxes and sometimes paper bags, so....one household was a bust, the other got it."
2,My cat not interested by this toy.,"My very energetic and playful 3 yr old cat loves anything that rolls. Unfortunately that means stuff goes under furniture and your truly has to fish it out. I saw this and thought it would be perfect and the reviews were glowing.Sadly, the glowing reviews do not reflect my experience. My cat rubbed against the catnip mouse for a couple minutes, then briefly batted one of the track balls. When the ball didn't roll away, but remained in the track, he got bored and turned away. I put it away and got it out a couple days later. He was even more bored with it than the first time.If you have a cat that enjoys unpredictable playthings, I don't think this is a great toy, even tho it is colorful and well-made.As an alternate, I suggest the Kong toy with feathers. Inexpensive and highly highly entertaining for my guy (I have no affiliation with Kong)."
5,The cat likes it,"When the Cheese Chase arrived and I set it out for the cat, he only played with the mouse on top for the first day. But surprisingly, the next morning I heard this noise coming from the next room. It was the cat playing with the balls inside.Now, whenever he comes in from outside, instead of racing for the food dish, he stops at the Cheese Chase for a minute to check it out. It's been here almost a week and the cat plays with it every day, several times a day.I'm pleasantly surprised. Money well spent.The cat would give it two thumbs up if he had thumbs."
5,Endless Fun,This is the first toy I have come across that has really kept my cats busy. They've played with it since they were kittens. I'll get it started by moving the ball and they go nuts. Sometimes I don't need to even get it started. They love it either way and it's the only toy I've seen that really keeps them happy and occupied.
5,Tasha loves it,"Length:: 0:22 MinsAfter a few weeks, she still loves it.Update January 30 2012, Tasha is now a full grown cat. She still loves this toy. She plays with it for at least 20 minutes a day.That is alot of pleasure for her and my family for the cost.Update: Tasha still loves this toy! She plays with it almost daily.Update: 1.5 years later Tasha still loves this toy, and her new little friend Ziggy loves it to!"
3,Ed Ruscha reviewed by the only correct source,"My friend is named Dan and he really likes this book. He first showed it to me outside during recess. We are both only 13 . If I had to chose over either this Ed Ruscha book or a Sega dream cast, playstation 2, alot of chocolate, a gun that looked real but wasn't, but felt real cause it was so heavy, I would choose the gun, probably because I couldn't get a gun now( I am not 21) and because none of my friends have ever seen a gun, it would be cool. But I still would like to flip through this book, but I don't know if I'd buy it, especially with my own money."
5,Beautiful,"I am pleasantly surprised by the softness of this bridle & how pretty it is. This is my daughter first bridle, she has been taking lessons for a year. I am very glad I purchased this. She was so happy."
4,very reliable,"Over the past several years I have used several different small transportable hard drives. This one has lasted the longest of any that I have tried. The one limitation shared by USB2 powered drives like this one that do not have a connection for an external power supply is that they can pull excessive power when connected to a USB1 port. Unlike other similar drives, this one can still work with the USB1 port on my laptop. It does nto, however, work with my USB2 port PCMCIA adaptor. A longer USB2 cable would be nice. In summary, this is the most reliable and easy to use compact external hard drives I've found."
4,Metal Detector GC1016A review,"The product is simple to put together, seems to be functioning well and a good value for the money. We actually ended up with the next level up due to a supplier issue."
1,Crazy Quilt Patchwork: A Quick and Easy Approach With 19 Pro,"This is not a good book. The projects are ugly, and nothing one would want to waste time on. I was very disappointed! Fortunately it was not an expensive book - yet, certainly not worth ordering."
5,Fantastic! C'est Bon pour le Morale,"This Cd is excellent, si vous etes francais, cette Cd est excellent. C'est la musique merengue, samba, et salsa, tout en francais!"
4,Best of Live,"Over their past few albums, Live has been experimental with what their sound is like. Mental Jewlery sounds nothing like Throwing Copper, or Secret Samadhi.I see Birds of Pray as being the ""Best of Live"" CD. It may not have the exact songs, but it contains in itself a variety of sounds from all of their CDs.""Bring People Together"" is reminiscent of Mental Jewlery,""Heaven"" is more like a Throwing Copper song,""Sanctity"" is a lot like a Secret Samadhi Song,""What are we fighting for?"" fits with the spiritual theme in Distance to Here,Lastly, ""She"" fits with the V theme.It is the best sounds of Live. It describes who Live is in one CD. It, to say the least, the Biography of one of the most under-appreciated bands. This CD has potential, and hopefully Live will get the recognition they have deserved for so long."
3,"""Heaven"" rules, the rest of the album drools!","This has to be the first product I gave a low rating to, which is sad. I have this CD, and unfornately, the only song I like on it is ""Heaven."" There is a lot of truth behind this song. My recommendation to people who have just heard this one song is that they should get the MP3 of the song, and not buy the CD just for the one song."
4,Not bad at all.,This Album has alot of great Guitar work in it.This is alot better Than there last Effort.Not a whole lot of the Heavier things on here.But it is worth it!I wish I could have given it 3.5 stars...but I gave them the Benefit of the dought.
3,just the facts m'lady,"The authors do an excellent job describing, in great detail, the ins and outs of of life in a midieval castle. So, it would be of great use to someone doing a research report for some odd reason on the subject. Otherwise, I found the book unfit for casual reading because its nothing but factoid after factoid, presented without a hint of personality. Basically reads like an owners manual. I was expecting more with a subject this fascinating."
4,Nectar in a sieve,"I like this book, but it was a little difficult for me to understand because the author used many British words which were hard to understand. I am high school student. I recomend this book to people who are interested in reading family stories. It tells how people suffer in poverty; even though they work hard, they do not get what they deserve."
2,Teenager's Opinion,"One word.... Sentimentality. That word sums up this entire book. This book was on the 10th grade reading list and I can honestly say that I thoroughly disliked it from start to finish. It gets two stars for the language, metaphors, and descriptions within it, but nothing more.This book is based entirely on trying to get an emotion out of the reader, which in this case is sympathy. I find sentimental writing to be very poor and I just can't get into it, but to each his own. I wouldn't object to anyone wanting to read this book as their personal tastes might allow them to squeeze some enjoyment from it but I would never go so far as to reccomend it to anybody.Don't get me wrong. The language used throughout the novel as well as the change in perspective is a breath of fresh air compared to the meat of story itself. My belief is that the only reason this book ended is because the author could not think of any other tragic events that could occur.--tim"
4,Looking through the eyes of the lost one,"This book showed the courage of a woman who had dreams of one day marrying into a family of somewhat wealth. With the changing of times her dream of a happy beginning didn't take place. Her happiness took place through the achievements of her life. She learned to enjoy what some would call the simple things in life. One can learn to enjoy life as it's given day to day, learning to use our resources to its fullest."
3,A porrly constructed plot dampens this novel's chance,"This is the first time i have taken the time to review a book online, and i feel compelled to do it only to warn those of you out there who have not read this book. My warning is simply that although the book has interesting events, the plot is strung along haphazardly and with little relation between one mini-chapter and the next. This book could have been a lot better had the publisher forced the writer to construe a story rather than a collection of short stories compiled into a chapter book."
2,Dullsville,"THIS BOOKS GETS TWO STARS.This book is very boring, however the information given by the author on the lifestyle, and the hardships is a little bit interesting. It is a bit gory. Thats why it deserves two stars."
4,well...i don't think i would read this out side of school.,"unique story with many emotional ups and downs. it is actully nice to read a book with a not-so-happy ending, that does get old. i had to read this book for an english class in high school a while ago...its very eye-opening...but i don't think i would read it ""for fun"". unless you are into that kinda stuff. but if you are interested in the Indian culture this would be a WONDERFUL book. it is deffinatly one of the better books i have read for school. :]"
3,watching her livelihood slip away,"Share a journey with Rukmani, an impoverished Indian woman who is sent off into marriage with a man she had never met and faces a rural society that must make room for industrialization and modernization. Each planting season is a life and death challenge where they must face hunger and the wrath of nature's elements. She cannot turn away as she watches her children starve to death. What more could someone possibly go through before losing all hope? The book reveals the extreme limits of one woman's fortitude in facing a world that cannot feed or shelter her."
2,Indian women struggles in modern day India.,"This book although interesting in theory is nothing more than a nonsenseical account of a poor indian women. Boring and confusing, this book even though it seems a short read takes more time and effort that most people wish to give. If you are looking for a fun easy book with an uplifting spirit, try Chicken Soup for the Soul. If you want a depressing story of a women who just can get ahead try this. But check it out, it's not worth the buy."
4,This book forced me to think about the unfairness of life.,"I felt a great sadness upon finishing this book. I was not sure whether to cheer for Rukmani or pity her. She worked with what she had, and moved on. She did what she had to do and displayed remarkable strength and dignity. Life handed her more adversity than she deserved and still she persevered. There was no time for regret or compunction because survival took precedence over everything. Her tenacity caused me to look inward at myself, to analyze whether I too possessed this kind of quiet strength. This book brought home to me what women across the world deal with every day. This has affirmed my belief that women are the strongest creatures on earth."
2,Melodramatic and depressing,"This book tells the story (the melodramatic story) of a peasant, tenant farming family in rural India at the turn of the century. Rukmani, the main character, is a youngest daughter married off to a man she has never met. The marriage turns out to be a good one and the couple have many children. The family experiences unspeakable tragedy as a late monsoon and one son's involvement in labor organizing catapults them even deeper into poverty. It catalogues the absolute vulnerability of the poor in traditional society transitioning towards industrialization, and the anguish of losing everything for people who have almost nothing. The book was very melodramatic and depressing."
3,Endless Suffering,"Nectar In A Sieve is easy reading, but a very hard story to grasp. It's sad to see how people in third world countries could suffer so much where they have to eat grass in order to survive. I admire Rukmani because throughout all her suffering and deaths in her family, she still maintains to have hope. I can't imagine how many people would have lived as far as she did without giving up or even dying? This book is very depressing, but a great story because it is a reality that many people are not aware of. I'm glad that there are authors like Kamala Markandaya to provide these stories for readers who ignore the miserable lifestyles of these families out there."
1,Sad sad sad,"I bought this game thinking it would work like all the other Barbie games, but no, I have installed and uninstalled it on my computer three times to no avail. I'm so mad that I wasted $20 on something that won't work, even after updating our DirectX from microsoft.com. I wish I could tell you how the game was...if it even worked..."
3,A nice addition to your tall tale teaching unit,I found this book to be a useful addition to my teaching of tall tales and their characteristics. The students in my classroom especially liked the rap about Snickerdoodle that is included on the CD.
4,nice,"This is ok for me, my friend raves about but since my skin is really sensitive to lotion stuff i forget to use it coz i have so much to choose from and i forget which one i had put on."
1,Not that great...,The book is small 5 x 5 and all the pictures are b&w. Most of the pictures have a softened (grainy) tone. I prefer clear pictures. Most of the subjects are normal people and unknown.
4,For the Life of the World,"Schmemann is Orthodox as to religion, my interest is more Fundamentalist yet I found much with which to agree from his presentation. The book I have is a Kindle Edition which means that within two minutes of ordering I was reading the book. If you want to know more about Orthodox thought this book would be helpful depending on your religious point of view."
4,Great intro to Blue Grass,"Fire on the banjo and heart breaking longing are melded together for one sweet cd. Fans of good song writing and masterful playing looking to get a feel of Blue Grass music will appreciate this collection of some of the finest examples of the High Lonesome sound on record. Some songs are only available on this disk! I am a Tom Waits, John Coltrane, and Grateful Dead fan, and I continue to listen to and love this disc three years after getting it."
5,Psychadellic,Very pleased with this product. This set included the original The Fast & the Furious and 2 Fast & 2 Furious. It was used but not worn out or damaged in anyway. The price was very good for this set and even beat the price of purchasing each movie separately. I was able to complete my Fast & Furious set very easily ( I already owned parts 3 & 4).
5,AntiTrust,Just another awesome movie sent to the turmoil of being completely underrated. Awesome acting and amazing plot. Tim Robbins as usual giving his very best. This adrenaline pumping movie will have you on edge as it comes to it's finish. A must watch. Some critic reviews just have to be IGNORED. See it and find out for yourself. A keeper!
4,Heavy-Handed but Pretty Good,"Antitrust is one of those movies filled with lots of great ideas and even some brilliant execution, but suffers from the weight of its own plot. Because one of the central themes of the film is open-source (allowing everyone in the world to see the code of your programs so they can alter or improve it), this point ends up taking over the entire story and (sadly) trumps character. As a result, some of the people aren't as fleshed out as they should be, and the main character's arc is a bit muted.Nevertheless, the movie is still quite a lot of fun. The climax of the film is a nice payoff for viewers and the very end isn't too sentimental (though a bit heavy-handed with the ""moral of the story"").It's worth viewing. Consider renting if you've never seen it before, in case this kind of movie isn't for you."
1,FAMOUS actors in a BAD movie,"This seems like it's gonna be cool with Ryan Phillippe, Claire Forlani, Rachael Leigh Cook, Tim Robbins, and so forth, but it turned out to be very bland. I feel asleep on it. Save your money for a more interesting movie."
4,"Watch out Bill Gates, Tim Robbings is in the house!","Alotta people didn't like this movie, mainly cause it was the same thing as ""The Net"" or ""Hackers"", but I thought it was pretty good! If you love computers and hacking you'll love this movie."
1,Pathetic casting,"What pathetic casting. My first comment when I saw Claire Forlani cast as the love interest was ""Hello. Way too old to be dating a just graduated hacker geek"". So of course she was the bad girl working for the bad guys. If they had cast Rachel Leigh Cook as the love interest then maybe it would have been a surprise what her character was really about. Jeez, who was the casting agent for this movie?? Horrible."
4,"It's not that bad, people!","I actually liked this movie (contrary to most critics and viewers alike). Sure, some of it is over-the-top and cheesy, and sure, you have to suspend reality for an hour and forty eight minutes, but so what ? I found this actually to be kind of suspenseful, and although I think Claire Forlani is getting too old to play in these teen moves (i.e. Boys and Girls), I think she did a reasonable job. And who can resist Ryan Phillippe? A stretch of the imagination allows him to be a computer nerd, and he certainly acts the part. Along with Rachael Leigh Cook, this movie has a great cast, mostly convincing acting and although the plot borderlines on unbelievable, just sit back and enjoy the ride."
5,Nostalgic,"As a child I can remember listening to my father play the album Sonic Boom over and over again. I did not appreciate it much as a kid, but as an adult I can fully understand the fascination with the tunes. Lee Morgan is often underrated, but a sinister genius in this album."
3,An Outstanding Work on The Textual Issue,"Although many have authors have written in the defence of the MT (majority text types), Van Bruggen's pamphlet ranks amoung the best. This booklet is well written. He also has an excellent book discussing the superiority of formal equivelency vs. dynamic equivelency."
5,His Best,"Having read most of Durrell's books I personally feel this is his best. I agree with the other reviewers and would also like to take a trip in Durrell's footsteps and see an island which, according to my partner who lived there in the 80s, is still, in many ways, much as Durrell described it. That it could be torn apart by a vicious civil war is a tragedy and a salient warning of the dangers of outside interference and misplaced and misdirected nationalism. I highly recommend it."
1,Useless manual and incorrect website,"DO NOT BUY!!! I bought this at Wal-mart for the (seemingly) low price of $39.99. A camera that you can't function isn't a deal at any price. It wouldn't do the appropriate action even when I followed the manual verbatim. When I tried the website that's recommended in the manual, I was sent instead to a home page that didn't have any support for the model number ( 57490 ). They had lots of other models, but not this one. Apparently people have had trouble downloading pictures more than once, but I didn't even get that far. Luckily I was able to return it, but online purchases aren't as easy to remedy."
2,definitely not her greatest,"Third Girl is one of Agatha Christie's slower paced books. It rambles on and on about the same things over and over again. If some of the middle had been cut out, the book might have been a lot better.In the middle, I got so bored that I started counting the pages until the end. Usually with Agatha Christie, you just can't put the book down. With this one, I just wanted to finish it to find out who the murderer is.If you've read many of Agatha Christie's books, you might want to read this, but you shouldn't read this one first. I suggest The Secret Adversary for a more fast paced and exciting read."
3,"Not a bad plot, but very dated","Agatha Christie attempts to depict the swinging sixties, and falls on her face. The mystery is interesting enough, and, as usual, the solution to is discovered not through forensics but through analyzing the pyschological undercurrents of the situation. (The ""third girl"" idea is used very cleverly, I thought.) On the other hand, Christie writes about swinging London from an outsider's perspective, and she clearly doesn't know what she's talking about when it comes to drugs, so some parts of the book are laughable. Still, unlike many novelists who jumped on the hippie bandwagon, she's compassionate and doesn't go for the cheap shots -- the villain isn't a drug-crazed hippie but a person with more traditional (and despicable) motives. Worth reading in spite of its flaws."
3,Hangman,"First off it is out of print so you can't rent it most places including Netflix. Second, it isn't a bad production and the acting is fairly decent. As for the story seems familiar some critics say? Good luck with finding one that doesn't seem familiar anymore. I found it intriguing enough to keep my interest and I wasn't disappointed I spent the time watching it. I like Lou Diamond Phillips and Madchen Amick and I think they did a decent job in this one, B movie or not. I for one am getting a copy of the DVD. Good quality with some replayability. If you enjoyed this, catchA Better Way to Die.CA Luster"
2,not a practical guide to Apex/HTMLDB,"You might as well print the manuals that Oracle supplies with Apex/HTMLDB.This book gives no practical examples. This book does not give information about how to use features of Apex/HTMLDB in real life. It is only a list of all the features and options without explanation.After using the book for some time, I doubt the authors ever used Apex / HTMLDB in a serious way."
5,Context,"Fantastic study of weapons of mass destruction, the drug war and other short-sided foreign policies (from both parties) that leads to so many of our avoidable messes.Nice depth and footnotes to back it up."
5,Great!,I love to place pictures around my home and this item is especially good for that! I can adjust my pictures all kinds of ways and works for variety of sizes!
3,Make sure your recorder provides plug-in power,"This mic is good but the descriptions are not accurate. It can be powered by batteries, but there is no battery adapter included.The Technical Data page reads ""Power Requirements: CR2025 Battery (not included), or plug-in power"" which leads you to think that there is a battery box included where you can put a CR2025 battery. THERE IS NO BATTERY BOX INCLUDED WITH THIS MODEL.This model only works with plug-in power devices. Make sure that the device you intend to plug this mic into has plug-in power capabilities. It works fine with most computer sound card mic inputs, but it may not work with other devices.If you need a self-powered mic of similar characteristics get a Sony ECM-C115. According to the manual, the ECM-C115 provides a battery box and can work with devices that do not provide plug-in power, whereas the ECM-C10 and ECM-CS10 cannot."
5,Nice necklace,"The Sterling Silver Labradorite and Black Onyx Drop Stone Amulet Pendant, I ordered is very pretty and is a very nice necklace for the price. And the colors will go with any outfit too.Thanks. Mrs. L. Davis"
4,Good thriller about repercussions of adultery,"The message is familiar: adultery brings consequences to all those involved. This film takes it to another level with deadly repercussions for many of the people involved in this mess, one of whom has also engaged in an illegal scheme at work that only complicates things even further for him.There is also an odd and rather sad metaphor involving two dogs which belong to some of the people of the film; I won't spoil it.You will not be able to predict all the things that will go horribly wrong here, and that's a good thing."
4,THE SQUARE,"The Square is yet another fine Austalian drama. It tells of an affair, of betrayal, and revenge. It is set in the construction site of a large road bridge. An unlikely location for a powerful drama.The opening scene in the rain where the leads are bonking furiously in an old Ford Laser may seem a bit off putting for some viewers (how could they fit in such a small vehicle). The plot is unusual but highly believable leading to a dramatic and surprising finale. They say The Square is a 'stroke of twisted genius' and I heartily concur.As usual in Australian movies the leading actors are ably assisted by a team of polished minor characters, all drawn from Australian theatre and television.I get The Square feeling this will become a Cult Film.Mash Edgerton's direction and Luke Doolan's editing are tight and up to the highest standard.Three and a half stars."
2,"functional, but they get knife marks","I bought these plates after I already had the rest of the matching dishes. I already knew that I was not pleased with them but had to complete my set of dishes and will have to tolerate them as long as they last.They are really sturdy and go with everything BUT they get the 'knife-marks' - grey scratch marks from utensils scraping them. I imagine that there are white dishes out there somewhere that are not subject to this flaw, and if there are I hope to find them, but these are not them."
5,fiestaware is great,"I started with three colors, periwinkle,light green and yellow. Now I have added the pink, cobalt, and orange. I like to pull out different color combinations for the changing season. in the spring, I have the light colors, and then in the fall, the darker colors. They are fun!"
3,"clear and concise, well-organized","This book is a solid overview of church history with helpful headings and boxes of key terms that provide a good review. However, for the reader interested more in learning than refreshing, this book can be a bit dry."
5,Who is the reasonable man?,"Simply sensational! A true page-turner! George Christie has really outdone himself with the third edition of this legal classic. A must-buy for every law student. Professor Christie has brought Torts to life in a way that only he can! Think contributory negligence is still alive? Think again. Christie sets the record straight in an epic tale of tortfeasors and trespass, judges and juries, restatements and res ipsa loquitur. Assume the risk and buy this one today!"
1,"Lame, Lame, Lame",If you want something actually scary... do not get this book. If you want ancient fiction that is suuuuuuuper dated and not scary. Buy this crap book.
2,boring and sentimental and pretentious,"A serial killer and terrorist for the KKK is finally sentenced to death in spite of the perjured testimony set up by his attorney. For nearly ten years, the man uses a private library (provided by the public on the death row) to flood the system with appeals and motions, to delay the execution. He is then joined by pro-bono lawyers (that is, paid by the public), headed by a $400,000 a year attorney (plus all expenses). The team uses every dirty trick and perjured testimony to tie up the system and delay the execution. Their position is that an elderly death-row inmate should just be released outright and they believe that the end justifies the maens.The result is pretentious and boring and a tragic waste of the creative writing genius of Grisham."
1,"Ready for the ""Chamber"" after reading it","This is Grisham's worst work. What should have been a short story, rambles on for hundreds of pages. Anyone who reads The Chamber will receive a tremendous education about the intricacies of cigarette smoke. If that thrills you, by all means waste a few hours with this text. If not, read something less laborious, like the dictionary."
2,A Werid Subconscience Ride,"The story is about a racist, who was involved in a murder, of two children, and disfiguring their father. He is being sentence to death via the gas chamber for this murder, that he only helped, but did not fully commit (Although he had committed many other crimes in the past)As one writer said the first half of this book is about this terrible racist man who deserves to die. The second half on the book was about the same man, but he is now portrayed as a guy with a heart, and was truly sorry, and thru the true story you learn that he didn't wish for anyone to die, just a different kinda crime to be committed.I wasn't able to finish this book, because the plot became very predictable, and the facts about what happens when someone suffers at the hands of the chamber became too much for me."
1,Horrible,"1 Star because it is a John Grisham Work. This was Grisham using his best selling ability to write a book against the death penalty. If you are looking for a story that will hold your interest you came to the wrong place. The only reason I finshed the book is because I kept hoping it would get better. A great writer who wasted our time on this one. If you want to read a good law mystery pick Grisham -- just don't pick this one. The Client , Street Lawyer, Runaway Jury, The Firm are all 4-5 Star Books so read those not this book"
4,Grisham delivers an imformative novel about death row.,"This novel was overall good. It shows how a famly has beenashamed of their grandfather`s and their great grandfather`sracist actions. Somehow Adam Hall, a member of this particularfamily, defends his grandfather from getting the death penalty.At the end it shows a moral lesson about racism. It does haveflaws, though. One of them is it is too long and it reallygets boring sometimes. A good thing about the book isthe author`s style."
2,I recommend you skip this one.,"My least favorite of the Grisham books, The Chamber is a slow-paced story made up of tons of dialogue and very, very little action. For me, it started out boring and remained consistent to the very end. It's true, that it became a ""page turner"" near the end, but not the way you might think... I was hoping that something exciting might actually happen, but mainly just wanted to be done with it. I knew better than expect a good ending from Grisham anyway.Grisham once again revisits the racial issues of the South and even references his other ""racial"" book (the A Time to Kill) in the process. Unless you've been living in a cave, this is a topic beaten to death and he really has nothing new to ad. I wish I hadn't read it and could not, in good faith, recommend it to you."
2,One of Grisham's worst.,"Grisham has had many bestselling novels. Except this one is boring. Unless you're really into the book you'll maybe like it. When I read this book, I nearly fell asleep. It's just Adam Hall filing out petition after petition. If you loose interest in this book, but still go on you won't know how many petitions Adam Hall filed. It's that boring."
3,Everybody has an off day. . .,"Mr. Grisham is a good writer. He just couldn't pull this one off. I'm opposed to capital punishment, but I kept hoping they would fry this guy and get it over with. This character was the best argument for the electric chair since Charles Manson. I read the whole thing, thinking it would eventually get good, but it didn't. Still, an awful Grisham is better than a good somebody else. I'd still rather read him than Clancy."
3,The Chamber,"While the novel was excellent, the condition of the book was tattered and shabby when it was described as ""Like new condition."""
2,Cliched and two dimensional,"Usually Mr. Grishom's caricatures of American personalities are an amusing background to the suspence and action, but here it is the whole book. Also, it was almost embarassing for me to see him expose his own biases so close to the surface. He is not a great thinker, and he really just rehashes the same anti-capital punishment arguments over and over with little cosmetic changes. No action entertainment here, and I would have given it one star, except for some of the amusing caricatures."
4,A real page turner.,"A thought-provoking tale of the last days on Death Row. Grisham has written believable, flawed characters in the racist old Southerner convicted of planting a deadly bomb in a Jewish lawyer's office 30 years earlier, and the idealistic young attorney fighting for a stay of execution.My husband and I listened to the audio version while driving through the Utah desert. When we arrived at our hotel, after an 8-hour drive, we didn't want to get out of the car because we would have to stop the tape! I've also read the book. I recommend both the tape and the book."
4,Good read - but somewhat disappointing ending,"I enjoy the Grisham books for all the legal battle stuff - court rooms, strategy, filing briefs and motions, manuevering, etc.This book is a real eye opener about what life is like for a death-row inmate. Most of us have rather one-sided views - regardless of whether you favor the death penality or not.All in all, it is a good book. However, I agree with another reader who suggested that the ending left him feeling rather flat. It seems Grisham could have done more with the final chapter. He kinda leaves you in a funny spot with some unconcluded business."
5,The Chamber,It's been a long time since I have read a book that just can't be put down. It is a book that makes you think damn this can really happen.
4,Not a bad book on death penalty,"I think this book has portrayed fairly well on the position against the death penalty. It made more powerful argument than, I'd say, Life of David Gail. It has a more realistic ending as opposed to an happy ending of the most novels. The issue is between forgiveness as justice. Are we supposed to forgive even the worst of the mankind? Is death penalty justified for a cruel bloodthirst racist? The author is toward forgiveness in the novel. Anyways it was a book that makes you look at the other side of the coin if you're for the death penalty, and I strongly advise you to read it and give a second thought on death penalty if you support it. (That would probably include most of our politicians.)"
3,dissapointing ending to a wonderfuly written book,"the chambe does an outstanding job of describing the life of a death row inmate. yet I was dissapointed in the lack of excitement. There were many places Grisham could've gone with the plot at the end, and as a reader I was left curious as to why the death of sam cayhall was so boring"
3,An overall good story line,Of all the Grisham legal thrillers this is my least favorite. An excellent story line but excessively long. It could have been done better in my opinion. Otherwise this is an okay book.
2,This is the worst Grisham novel that I've read to date.,"As I skimmed through all these reviews I couldn't help but putmy dissenting opinion in. It did not provoke any thoughts on my partabout capital punishment. In addition, I did not feel any connection to any of the characters nor did I care of their fates. The plot seemed to lack any real direction and Grisham seemed as if he was trying to draw the novel out to his standard 500 pages. Despite all of these detractions, This book was able to keep me riveted in a fashion only John Grisham's books can. In my opinion he can only go up from here."
2,Grisham's weakest novel,"A very thin story line, not entertaining, no excitement, disappointing. Not the usual Grisham quality, which is suspenseful, entertaining and brings you into a different world."
3,"The average Grisham novel.....slow start, but good middle",The end was weak.....almost sad and depressing to see what happens to Sam.
3,Grisham gets serious,"He's a wealthy author now and can afford to try to get serious, and get serious he does with this compelling, but sometimes tedious meditation on the death penalty and one man's grueling demise on death row.Sam Cayhall, a vicious racist and Klan member, is defended from death by his grandson.Will the reader feel sympathy for this evil man? Will the suffering endured on death row and the passionate intervention of his grandson make Sam regret his evil life?I enjoyed this book but it is simply not a John Grisham book. He sets you up for a typical John Grisham denoument, but it simply never happens, and I felt kind of cheated at the end.Still, a sobering and saddening look at the death penalty, and a fairly good read."
4,"Heavy and depressing, but yet fun to read.","I hoped to see the earthbreaking ""wait"", at the last second of the excution but harsh reality didn't seem to care what I hoped. Grisham's way of building the plot and expressing charactors' emotions are awsome. Learned alot about death low."
3,Thought provoking but not satisfying,"While this book does make one think, it isn't really good fiction. The characters never achieve much more depth than they start the book with and the plot doesn't take the reader to any conclusion that feels complete. The book has the feel of a piece of true crime writing about a lackluster case.If John Grisham is really a writer of 'popular' fiction he certainly missed his audience with this one."
2,Everlasting nothingness,"John Grisham is one of the best authors there is who can write very long about nothing, and this book prooves it. Really, after about 20 pages nothing more happens, but Grisham just won't stop writing. The Chamber is a boring book that simply didn't need to be written. Grisham tries to make the dull story a bit interesting by making his standard young-lawyer hero into the convict's grandson, but he never really bothers to explore what this might do to both of them. And as I said, you can't really tell what he does insted, since it seems as if he's just putting words on the paper without knowing where he's going."
5,incredible story telling,"""The Chamber"" along with ""The Testament"", are the best Grisham novels I've read so far. I've given 1 through 5 stars on previous Grisham books reviewed and this was one of the deepest, thought-provoking books I've read by this author. I've always been strongly against the death penalty and this book supports that personal conviction more than I thought a novel could. So well written, it's a family story, it's a KKK story, it's a civil rights story it's an overall great story!Highly recommmend!"
3,John Grisham,"The book has a good beginning and plot. The suspense is also good and like all of Grisham's books the twists in along the story line are unusual and suspenseful, but the book tends to drag on and repeat itself. The ending is surpising. Not nearly as good as some other books by Grisham."
5,Some memories for Uncle Shel,"Today I heard Shel died, and it certainly is affecting me. I read all of his books when I was younger, and even recently warned my 5 year-old niece she'd turn into a TV from watching too much. Reading his poems today makes me cry, they are so funny and touching and true. We will miss you, Uncle Shel. Thank you for your wonderful work."
5,Light In the Attic,"Being a grandparent it is always enjoyable when an adored grandchild asks for books. She specifically requested the Shel Silverstein books, and we were delighted to order them for her for Christmas. These books have been read to all of our grandchildren!"
5,Always a classic,We were brought up on these delightful and funny poems in our elementary school outside of Chicago. I will treasure them forever as they gave me an excellent reading foundation and sparked my interest in poetry.Excellent teaching tool.
5,Good for any age!,"My adult daughter has wanted this book since she was in school. I decided to get it for her for Christmas. Of course she doesn't know it yet, but I know she'll love it! Thanks for getting it to me so quickly!Chris"
5,very happy....,"i find that the book came in a timely manner, it was well protected. as for the book nothing could be better than it..."
4,Love this book,I got this for my son for xmas he loves it and so do i. The price cant be beat either.
5,Such a great book!,"I loved this book when I was a kid, and knew my oldest daughter would love it. She's read it through a few times, and the poems always make her laugh."
1,HATE IT!!!,"THE COLOR IS BAD, THE PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS CRAPPY PRODUCT! YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY!"
5,Useful advertising guide to reaching China's consumers,"You can find an abundance of books about doing business in China. This one, however, takes a rare approach. Ad expert Tom Doctoroff confines his commentary (for the most part) to a subject he has the expertise to address - advertising - although he tends to generalize a bit about Chinese history and philosophy. He offers evidence and examples from both successful and unsuccessful ad campaigns to support his assertions about what will work if you want to build your brand in China. We find that this short book offers interesting perspectives on the Chinese consumer market, while it also provides a refresher course on the main principles of advertising and brand building in any market, whether it be East or West."
5,Are Chinese Becoming Western?,"No, we're not. This is the accurate conclusion of Doctoroff's book. Too many Western companies think we are and, as a result, make big mistakes. A quote from p. 2 says it all...""...We (Westerners) are moral absolutists and they are relativists. We value social dynamism, they value order. We view history's march as linear. They view it as cyclical, driven by fate. We believe society is ""good,"" they believe it corrupts. We are monotheists...and they are atheists, unified on a spirial plain by a belief in Chinese 'culture.'""What's amazing about the book he Doctoroff makes it clear what this also has to do with marketing soap, cars and diamonds.A must read for foreigners trying to make it"
5,SHINE once again.,"Alright, here I am a huge Newsboys fan- and I find this CD on the shelf of a local Christian bookstore. So I blow my food money for that week and buy it. I'm thankful for evermore that I did. Why not just having my favorite Newsboys hits ""Breakfast in Hell"" and ""Reality""- the new song ""Praises"" has become my favorite of all time. They're ecletic, hyper, and music you want to play driving down a long road- talking to God."
4,A Helpful Resource,"Design professionals may want something slicker, but for all the rest of us, this book is exactly the help we need. Clear, step-by-step directions and real-life examples."
1,disappointing imaging,"I bought this book the day I bought elements. I don't believe the author spent quality time on those issues which were important to me. I'm terribly confused on layers,filters etc. and her examples not only being in b&w were hard to discern, the examples didn't seem apporpriate. I thought I would learn how to maximize the use of an 8 by 11 piece of photo paper by bringing as many different images as I could to that one sheet, but nothing was written to help me. Confused and disappointed."
5,Perfect Holder.,I use mine everyday and it's wonderful. The phone is always right at your fingertips. Works great if you have a speakerphone option.
3,Not as engrossing,"I won't bother with the recap as most other reviewers have already done it.Suffice it to say that Sean Drummond is back.This thriller left me strangely unhappy. While there was nothing wrong with the premise of the storyline and the nice little detours it took (just when you thought you had it figured out), I felt as though the main character (Sean) was kind of a farce in this book.He was far from being deep in any meaningful way and the wise-cracks did not ring true for me.The storyline was a nice touch though and had me guessing to the end.While I did not hate this book, it just was not as tight and engrossing as the previous Haig books."
2,Sean's Back but without a good story,"Could have been an interesting story but it seemed to lack the depth of previous novels in regards to plot. While Sean does his regular wisecracking, it just doesn't seem like the right place for it, nor is it that funny. The plot is also just too contrived to be real. Not his best but I'll keep reading them in the future."
2,"interesting storyline, but style really poor","I fully realize that as a person who uses English as a second language I'm in a poor position to criticize someone else's style, but this book has really been poorly written. Dialogs are really unnatural (I recall a conversation about one of victims immediately after his death which was just too witty to be real) and some words are used too often. There are pages where the author starts using some expression and simply cannot quit it: in reality, actually, incidentally are a few examples. They pop up every other sentence.I am sticking to the book only because of the excellent narration by Scott Brick (this refers to the audio version)."
4,"I disagree with last reviewer, very engrossing read!","I thought this book was a great addition to the series! The author keeps writing about what he knows, and he knows the U.S. military. Haig is a West Point Graduate with 22 years of Army service.The Main character is Army JAG lawyer, Sean Drummond is his old wisecracking self, zinging oneliners and putting the idiots in place. His intincts again prove he is the best. The Drummond character definitly carries this book.I wont rehash the plot that has already been done enough here. The plot while nothing too complicated was compelling and kept me turning the pages. The characters are well Drawn and I loved the Bad guys (they were fun to hate!)."
4,Cool necklace,"This necklace looks really cool and simple, the mini harmonica isn't that playable though, holes 2 and 3 on mine are too stiff for any practical song playing, And the tuning is a little bit off, however you do have a full scale of notes (C~C)! which can be a handy little reference if you're starting to play any musical instruments."
2,Very disappointed,"I have to say that I am very upset due to something that I think could easily be prevented: I ordered 2 of these for my sons who are very into music instruments & happen to LOVE harmonicas! However, upon arrival the beads on 1 of necklaces are pink! (also happened to another reviewer)I think this is very poor judgment because I think there are several ""unisex"" colors out there that could have been chosen over pink! Bad call! I don't feel like messing around with return/exchange stuff so in order to save myself the headache I just went ahead & painted the cheap plastic beads myself (a different color other than pink!) It should be clearly stated in the seller's description that you might possibly receive a pink one...neither of my boys happens to like the color pink!"
4,A worthy addition to the Devilman genre,This is one of the best hero's journey themes in Anime. Things start off ominous and then progress to an outright slugfest. Just enough character development is sprinkled in so you care when they struggle. And it never lets up right to the end.The Devil Lady - The Complete Collection
3,"OK, but not the best","Item received on time, however, these fenders required a considerable amount of sanding before painting, due to rust that built up while sitting in a warehouse somewhere."
3,broken train,received train...the shell of the engine was broke..train runs fine..did not expect it to be broken.no indecation that the product was damaged during shipping
3,Not great suspense; but not awful either,"An odd and ultimately somewhat unsatisfying mystery. Grace Lawson picks up her photos and finds a 20+ year old photo of her husband in the pack. He sees it - and disappears.After being rebuffed by the police, Grace sets out to find him. She has help from an odd assortment of characters. An assistant federal district attorney. A reputed mobster. All are tied to her by a decades old incident.The characters are reasonably well developed, but still never become compelling. The plot takes one twist after another, some of them predictable, some not. The ending struck me as contrived.It's not a bad book; it's just far from a totally engrossing read. And, as noted, it on the unsatisfying side. Kind of like a barely passable lunch: it all looks good on the plate, but simply doesn't taste quite right.Jerry"
5,My favorite Harlan Coben novel,"This was my first Harlan Coben novel and my favorite. So, it's a little far fetched - aren't they all? At least I didn't see the ending coming a mile away like with other mystery novels. How refreshing to have a protangonist that isn't a cop/doctor/reporter type. Just a regular person whose world gets turned upside down. Loved it!"
4,Suspenseful Page Turner,"I bought this book on a whim & couldn't put it down. I just had to know how it ended. If you want to be engrossed for several hours, you can't go wrong with this book. I enjoy Harlan Coben's writing & style very much and plan to read the rest of his stuff before the year's end."
3,WORTH READING...AFTER OTHERS,"I became a Coben fan after reading _Tell No One_ & (my favorite!) _Gone For Good_. In _Just One Look_, Coben continues his husband-and-wife-something-in-the-past story line (to say nothing of his bright-colored book covers/jackets)--although it (story line) is not as (barring believable) magnetic. However, there is the ""Cobin-ending,"" but nothing as gripping as the two previous books. Futher frustrating, there are too many characters directly (or indirectly) involved in the protagonist's struggle to find the truth--(the past and her husband), which complicates and obfuscates the plot. Always Cobin, though, leave it to him to pen stimulating end-of-chapter hooks, just enough to MAKE you turn the page...and another....Nothwithstanding the three stars, I quasi-enjoyed reading it & would recommend this novel, but only AFTER reading (in this order) _Gone For Good_ & _Tell No One_, both of which I assigned 5 stars."
2,"Another disappearance! Oh, my!","I have a feeling that Coben's high school creative writing teacher told him that you MUST have someone disappear and reappear as someone else or disappear and eventually come back as yourself. I have read the last 4 of Coben's books and am surely seeing a trend.A pack of Photomat pictures has an extra one inserted from many years ago. Husband disappears on the night wife shows him the photo. Nice premise. However, this one fails to deliver.It hearkens back to a rock concert from 15 years ago when 18 young people were killed in a stampede caused by a gunshot. Who did what, when, where, and why is too mind-boggling. After finishing the book, I'm still not sure what happened. Will probably pass on Coben's next."
4,Another Thriller from Coben,"Pick up a Harlan Coben book and you usually can't go wrong. This one is another fantastic read by this author. It was hard for me to put down - I read it in a day and a half. It starts out with a bang and doesn't let up. There are a lot of twists and turns toward the end of the book, so you will have to keep up. But it is definitely worth the read. You won't be disappointed."
1,Ignore all 5 star reviews,"Here's the deal. Harlan Coben must have fifty or so friends that give his books 5 star reviews. And any one star reviews, his friends say that they didn't help and it looks like the one star reviewers are wacko.This book blows as much as his other books blow. If you work hard for your money, don't buy this book. It is not interesting. It is not entertaining. It is not worth the money. The internet allows the common folk to put a hack like Harlan Coben out of business. Do not buy this book, buy a Tom Wolfe book or how bout Nick Hornsby, those are good writers.Harlan Coben blows. Period."
2,Someone pulled the rug out from under me.,"I really liked this book and had a hard time putting it down. A break to read a chapter turned into five chapters.The ending, however, left me completely unsatisfied. I would not recommend this book."
1,Same story once again,If you've never read one of Harlan's books before you'll enjoy it very much. If you've read ANY of his books you'll find it is just the same recycled story every time. Even one story was so close to the other one if you changed some of the names the rest had chapters that were identical.
3,Great up to a point,"This book takes off from page one and you will NOT want to put it down until you have read all of it.It is an exciting, suspenseful story, with many twists and turns to keep you guessing but then it all starts to fall apart at the end.To me, the explanation of why everything occurred was way too far fetched and unbelievable.I loved the book - up to the end."
2,Not His Best,"Having devoured the past three or four Coben books, I found Just One Look to be extremely disappointing and frankly boring. I kept reading the book in the hope that Coben's signature surprises and twists/turns would redeem the book. Unfortunately, such was not the case as the storyline is altogether implausible with characters that are hardly compelling. Finally, the story simply does not make sense. Hopefully, Coben's next book will be return to his previous efforts.If you're looking for other enjoyable authors pick up anything by Lee Child (Jack Reacher series) or Clinton McKinzie (Antonio Burns series)."
2,Look Away!,"Who cares? Plot twists for their own sake just give you a headache. I good story where you care about the characters and care what happenes and why can benefit from such twists. But here, the twists are just to twist, like in a noose! I've read everything Harlan's written. Looks like he owned his publisher one. Looks like he played games with his plot just to show you he could. Looks like he puts in irrelevant suburban details to add pages to the plot. Looks like you should Tell No One about this book. I hope his talent isn't Gone For Good. After reading this book you may consider No Second Chance. But if you Look Away! you'll be grateful. This Fade Shot may be a Deal Braker."
2,No pay-off,"I enjoyed the writing and I was quickly drawn into the story. I was eager to find out what happened, but I was very disappointed in how the mystery was solved. Perhaps Coben was particularly rushed or uninspired when he was writing the second half of this book. I stayed in it for the pay-off, but there was none.There is actually a scene that reads like an episode of Scooby-Doo, in which the answer to the biggest mystery, solved off-stage, is revealed to the culprit.I don't mind that the scary guy is Korean, but since people don't know his name, they (and therefore, the author) repeatedly refer to him only as ""the Asian man."" Gracious.I'm curious enough to read another Coben book because I enjoy the ""my life isn't what I thought it was"" premise, but I hope I won't be wasting my time."
2,Skip it!!!,"I've loved all 10 of Coben's previous novels, but this one is utterly AWFUL. It is convoluted and several notches below his usually high standards. Miss it.Maybe, with Connelly & Crais returning to their bread & butter characters, Coben should consider giving us a new Myron Bolitar mystery."
4,An Unusual Business Plan,"A rather funny novel about three guys who set up a business as assassins, complete with advertising, publicly traded stock, and hostile takeover attempts. Worth reading."
1,Is this for dogs or for children?,"I bought this for our 4-month-old Jack Russell Terrier and within the first 2 minutes of him playing with it, he began tearing off pieces of the feathery, fabric tail. In fact, a few minutes later I had to take scissors to it and cut the tail off because it was shedding strings all over the place and our pup was choking on it.He got the toy duck back and really likes it, but 2 days in he's now ripped a few holes in it and taken some stuffing out, so we've had to take it away. He only got it during supervised play time, and only for a few hours here and there, so there's no excuse for it being destroyed this quickly.Whoever came up with this ""dog"" toy either doesn't own a dog or has the laziest dog around, because I felt like it was put together for kids and not dogs. If you want to waste $6 on a toy that won't last a week, feel free to buy the Hartz Quackers duck toy."
2,Ducky,"I bought the duck for my dog because he loves them. The first two I bought somewhere else held up for a year. This one held up for a month so far but is fast going. I can't find the type I use to buy, but it was much better made than this one. I was quite disappointed in this."
4,Don Quijote de la Mancha,"FYI - Your description says this is in English, which is what I was looking for, but it is in Spanish!"
4,Audiocassette,I am using this with my advanced Spanish 3 students with enough support for them to be able to see what a great farce this story is. What I really need is the audiocassette that goes with it. Anyone know how to lay hands on that?
4,good little guide,"We took a trip to Portland over a long weekend, and this guide was incredibly useful. Although we used the web to make our hotel reservations, we use this guide for everything else. The food reservations were always spot on, as were the things to do reservations."
1,Cell phone battery,"Received battery without any problems. The battery does not charge and the original battery is still being used. I have not contacted the vendor for a resolution as of yet and due to the cost do not believe I will. Rather than wasting any more time on the phone which still works but the original battery does not last as long as it should, I will be replacing the phone once it fails completely."
1,No product,I received the first battery which would not take a charge. I have been waiting for a replacement for several weeks with no response from the vendor. I cannot review a product I have yet to receive in usable condition.
4,CSS Mastery Review,"I'm a developer with minimal experience designing web pages ""by hand."" Most of my work on the front-end includes using built in templates and designers to do the front-end magic for me.I decided to change all that and picked up this book. In a couple of days I was up and running creating some pretty cool front-end designs...plus, the advice in this book matched almost all the advice I was getting from one of our top front-end guys."
4,Brian's Review,This book requires that you have some previous CSS knowledge. The first few chapters provide a quick and thorough review of things that you should already know about CSS. The rest of the book is packed full of useful CSS tips. I take Web Coding classes and can say that this book very closely follows the same teachings of professors. I would recommend this book for intermediate level CSS people wanting to hone and advance their understanding of CSS.
4,Excellent reference despite errors,"I can not argue with many of the other reviews which describe the errors in the book. There are more than a few. However, most advanced CSS users should be able to spot the errors relatively quickly. But lets not concentrate on the errors.This book is one of the few CSS books that lives up to its title. This is a book on Mastering CSS, and is an advanced book on CSS (the only truly advanced CSS book that I am familiar with). I find myself re-reading this book quite frequently, to reacquaint myself with the information within. CSS is all about details and the results in multiple browsers. This references helps describe the differences not by simply pointing them out, but by illustrating why they occur.Highly recommended book... any developer who uses CSS should have this reference at their disposal."
3,Good Book but how about checking typos before publishing?,"Before you buy this book from all the glowing reviews check this link below, & it will show you all the aggravating typos in this book. (10 total pages of corrections.)http://www.cssmastery.com/CSSMastery-Errata.pdfIt makes it very irritating to use.The book is good if you are ready to stick with it, but before I buy from these authors again, I am waiting for the errata to be a few months old. It kind of feels like a ripoff to get a book that you have to constantly go back & forth to a pdf (painful) to make sure it isn't a typo on your part when css does not work as expected.I like friends of ed books in general, but we do pay money for these things as customers & should demand more from authors."
4,"Great content, could do with a quick reference section","I love the way Andy explains it in English from the very beginning of the CSS process. He provides step by step guides on how to achieve various standard layouts. One thing it could do with though is a quick reference guide that you can flip straight to later - I found it difficult sometimes to find the exact piece I remembered from when I read it last. I had to thumb for a while to locate it again. That being said, I could have used the index or even googled it!"
4,This true story shows The Injustice Criminal Justice System,"I have to totally agree with Dr. Charles T. Kelly, Jr from the first book review and the review on the second book to do with the McDonald case. With the information from the Freedom of Information Act there is enough evidence to at least be able to give Dr.McDonald a right to a second Trial and not go against his constitutional rights. In Fatal Vision there were mistakes that were made by the Military and our Government seemed to have decided to ignore other evidence and just decide to go after Dr. Mcdonald for the Murders of his Family."
3,Using the inner power,"This practical handbook demonstrates the use of the power of mind to achieve harmony in various areas of life. These include healing of oneself and others, both physical and mental, solving money and relationship problems, and more. Many examples of healing are given and every chapter ends with the exercise technique to solve that particular problem. Although this book is valuable, I have not found the text to be as engaging or inspiring as, for example, the work of Catherine Ponder or Joseph Murphy. Also, not enough emphasis is put on harnessing the power of the subconscious or on how to overcome resistance from the conscious mind. Having said that, everyone who seriously and consistently practices the eternal truths explained here will find great benefit."
2,Catholicism,"Although this book has some nice ways of looking at things, much of it doesn't agree with the Catholic church. I stopped reading it at page 94 :)"
1,It's really not as good as it had to be...,"I thought Paulina's crossover album would have more new songs but half of the CD is made of ""known"" songs: English translations from her Spanish album ""Paulina"" (2000) and Spanish translations of some of the English songs of this album. Also the song ""Don't say goodbye"" is not a great song. I hope Paulina's next album will be better..."
1,Looks a 10 Music&Artist work? 1,Her Album Cover Looks Great but Musically She is so much like the Factory Driven Product that is flooding the Market nowadays.Her voice is a dime a dozen overall.the Music Sounds like everybody else that goes for Pop Music nowadays that is Played a 100 times a day.the kind of Material you'll hear&then not really care about in a few Months.
1,un desastre,este cd no era lo que esperaba. las canciones en ingles casi no se le entienden.la unica cancion buena es la de si tu te vas en espanol.sorry pau. espero que el proximo cd este mejor que este..
1,I HATE THIS CD...,"VERY BAD VOICE,VERY BAD SONGS!ONLY DONT SAY GOODBYE IS GOOD AND I'LL THINK IF I'LL BUY THIS SINGLE...ALSO PAULINA IS TRYING TO BE THE SAME AS BRITNEY SPEARS...SEE THE COVER OF THE CD SINGLE OF BRITNEY SPEARS:I'M A SLVE FOR YOU!SE COULD COPY HER BUT PUT HER PERSONAL STYLE ON IT...PAULINA JUST WANTS SOME MONEY AND THATS ALL!SO IF YOU ARE STUPIDS GIVE HER SOME MONEY AND IT IS OK!"
4,Paulina does it again!,"Well to be honest I was a little afraid to buy the cd, since I bought Shakira's ""Laundry Service"" I told myself I won't buy another crossover album, In my opinion she wasn't ready for a crossover yet. But with Pau's new cd that is not the case. Yes, she has an accent but she does really good with the so-called crossover. Really! a well done album."
2,So disappointing!,"I bought this CD after hearing ""Don't Say Goodbye"", and hearing that she was a major hit in Mexico. When I popped in this CD, I expected a salsa style dance CD, however, after the first two songs it sounded more like Avril Lavigne mixed with old Britney Spears. I absolutely love the first two songs, but the rest is no good. If you are thinking of buying this CD, resist the temptation of ""Don't Say Goodbye"" and say hello to Shakira or Thalia."
5,SEXY LATIN ALBUM I LOVE IT!!!!!!,"Border Girl from Paulina Rubio is a hot sexy latin album that explodes with different styles of music within one cd!!!!! The cd has dance, pop, rock, and of course latin!!!!! Don't Say Goodbye is a hot dance song which gets my body moving which i like!!!!!!!! You need to get this album,because like i said before it has it all!!!!!!!!!!"
1,1 star for one good new song,"I like si tu te vas, it's catchy and more like the old Paulina.Her latest cd in Spanish- Paulina was the best thign out there. It is hard to listen to most of these songs. They are really lame and really hurt my ears. The songs in English have no quality. I don't see why they were translated. They sound odd and have lost any touch in English. I think people would enjoy the songs in Spanish even if they didn't understand it, because music transcends many borders."
4,Five Good Stories in the Anthology,"This collection of short stories, edited by Ann Tyler, has several good stories included. My favorite ones are:1) My Mistress by Laurie Colwin2) The Count and the Princess by Joseph Epstein3) Scales by Louis Erdrich4) Starlight by Marian Thurm5) Reunion by Guy VanderhaegheIt is rare to read an anthology that has this many good stories included."
4,Excellent for the Serious Dane to Be,"As a to be exchange student to be next year I had been looking for a book on Denmark that was more than just a travellers guide to the sights. I found the book to be a very helpful insight into Danish culture. Some parts are very brutally honest, Danish laziness under the socialist system and other things...I reccomend this book to anyone with a serious interest in Denmark if, and only if, they will not let Morten Strange's opinion on things get in the way of expierencing Denmark for themselves."
1,Disappointed!,"After reading such good reviews from others, I found this book boring at best. It took only three hours to read and I kept going, expecting something from the story that didn't happen. Rarely have I felt I have wasted money on a book, this is one of those times! I will definitely think twice about reading this author again!"
5,The thinking person's answer to the Horse Whisperer,"This is one of the most honest, gripping, romantic, sexually compelling and haunting stories I've read about love. It made me hate my marriage and now my husband hates Davidson. Seriously, the message is inspiring: that it's never too late for love, never too late for physical bliss. I especially liked the parts about parenting, and the chaos that erupts when your kids go to war with your new mate."
2,Easy & Entertaining - but typical,"I bought this book for a light easy read - it was. I got kind of frustrated with how typical the main characters were and how predictable the story lines were. Nothing was discussed in depth; not the main characters during sex, conversation, at work, their families, nothing. I felt things were glossed over. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to write about something like this that actually happened to you, still I felt it was kind of flat and predictable. Zack came into Sara's life, they had great sex, he gets her kids to behave, she gets spooked by the relationship's responsibilities, and ultimately goes off to find him after he leaves."
4,"Once I got going, I couldn't put it down...","I liked it. Once again, Ms. Davidson gives a view of a life most of us won't experience. I've always been a fan of her writing, and did enjoy 'Loose Change' more, but I liked 'Cowboy' enough to wish it wouldn't end but glad when 'she' worked out things with family and friends, and to recommend it to others. And if you're a big Dr. Quinn fan, she gives some behind the scenes glimpses of the TV show that are highly interesting. I hope, Sara, that you continue to write in your unique way and I will continue to buy. Thank you!"
3,Interesting but a hard read,"I love Antonia Fraser's writing, but this is an extremely hard book to get through. The book relies upon a knowledge of 17th Century English history and so I had to delay reading it since the first time I picked it up my knowledge of the English Civil War was sketchy. I appreciated it more after reading other biographies but still took a while to get through. Not her best."
3,Not the best thing in the world..,"If you are buying this book to learn how to manage MYSQL look on.. There is maybe one chapter on server mgt.. and 20 on programming for mysql.The server mgt. they do have is not very good, you would be better suited getting the docs from mysql.org.Jeremy"
3,entertainment,"Up to this book I have really enjoyed Elizabeth George's other Lynley and Havers series. But, even though Ms. George as the creator of the series has the right to change what she likes I felt the ending was just to get people to continue reading her next book. The ending wasn't necessary. To have an ending that has nothing to do with the rest of the book seems unnessary and just an attention getter. Ms. George doesn't need this type of ending to keep people reading about her two detectives. I hope she doesn't do this again and I will wait to see reviews of her next books before rushing out and buying it."
4,"Hey, that HURT!!","When they talk about a shocking tragedy, they ain't kidding! I never expected THAT!!!This is not a book for first-time George readers. It's too complex, too many subplots, too many long-established relationships, too much personal history involved. Plus the book's horrifying tragedy won't mean much to the new reader.As a die-hard George fan, though, I applaud this effort. It could have been a little more streamlined, but it left me wanting more. She was extremely brave to turn the plot the way she did. NOW what?? I can't wait to find out."
3,Don't read before reading book!,"Mindful of one of the earlier reviewers asking that the plot not be disclosed I will only say that the disappointment I felt when I read this book was huge! Well written of course, familiar characters of course but oh dear, I do feel somehow cheated! I have a problem with an American writing in 'cockney' English. However I spent the entire day and night reading this book but feeling very unhappy afterwards!!Read the book first before reading the reviews in this case!"
1,I'd Have Given It Zero Had That Been An Option,"This author painstakingly created 5 core characters who were five of the most memorable characters in detective fiction. In one stroke of the pen, she has totally obliterated all of it. George is, of course, the one who created these characters, and she certainly owes nothing to the readers, so she can certainly write their histories however she wants. However, as someone who has read all the books in this series, largely because of the relational aspects of these five wonderful characters, I find it very difficult to even conceive of reading another book in this series. In fact, she'd be much better off using this book as the end of this series, which she could certainly do given the ending, and start something new. There was just no excuse for what she did in this book."
3,Too sad,"I was beyond thrilled when Elizabeth George's newest hit the racks. I consumed the others in the series. Her latest is fast-paced and very interesting. But after a surprising and unwelcome plot-twist 3/4 of the way through, I really had a hard time finishing it. Overall, it was depressing. Who wants to see your heroes bleeding thru the last page?"
1,Totally disappointing book,"I have never written a book review before but feel compelled to warn potential readers -- especially those familiar with earlier books by Elizabeth George -- how disapointing this book is. First of all, her serial killer plot is weak, weak, weak. She never convincingly describes the killer's motivations, or makes him truly scary. (If you want serial killers, go to Ruth Rendall or thomas Harris for a real thrill.) Second, her killing off of Helen was a bad decision that will, in my opinion, permanently weaken -- or kill off -- the series. The contrast she set up between the growing love of the Lynley couple provided an absolutely necessary counterweight to the darkness of her plots. How odd that she didn't understand that. And what a cop-out to have Helen killed by some random person. I'd have given this book 0 stars if possible, and I'll never spend money on a George novel again."
1,A shocking betrayal,"As another reviewer noted, this book is too long by at least 200 pages, but most loyal readers wouldn't mind that.What loyal readers will mind is that the author deals with a major supporting character in an unexpected, cruel and random way that winds up being completely unjustified by the rest of the plot. I've read this series from the beginning, but I won't be reading the next one."
4,Most Enjoyable Mystery,"Having never read an Elizabeth George novel before & not being familiar with the characters I had no idea what to expect. The 627 pages seemed daunting especially for a mystery/suspense novel. How could it hold my interest to the end? Well, it did. The characters were so well developed with the right amount of baggage & foibles to make them interesting. I was further impressed with the fact that Ms. George is an American writing a mystery series set in London with British characters. Why she would put herself through such a headache to get the locations right not to mention the language, accents & all, is beyond me. Nevertheless, somehow she was able to be `spot on' on all counts. Detailed with terrific twists & turns, kept me guessing right up until the end & I thoroughly enjoyed the ride."
3,With No One as Witness,"This book is very suspenseful, but I didn't care for the sexual content. I love mysteries, but without crimes of sexual nature (toward children most especially.)"
2,another perspective,"I was astonished, as many other reviews seem to be. However, I was also very disappointed, and am probably through with Elizabeth George for at least a few books. I wish someone had given me a heads up - sometimes a ""spoiler"" can be a good thing."
1,"Longer and longer, worse and worse","Unlike PD James, Ruth Rendall, or Donna Leon, who also write long-running detective serials, Elizabeth George seems to be unable to sustain the quality of her Thomas Lynley series. In With No One as Witness she switches from her typical intimate family murder to a poorly-constructed serial killer tale. And, in a bizarre plot twist that strains credibility past the breaking point, she breaks up her extremely endearing group of long-running characters. The Thomas Lynley - Helen Clyde subplot has been the best and perhaps the most widely-followed continuing side story in mystery fiction since Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. Why she ended it by killing off Helen smacks of creative breakdown to me; it's very disappointing that she could not have come up with any other way to create new dramatic conflict in her series. I can't recommend this book, nor, by anticipation, any of its sequels. What a disappointment."
3,What was she thinking?,"This book was, as other reviewers have said, a real page turner. It was a great plot and gripping story. I would have rated it five stars had it not been for the shocking and unwarranted ending. The author's last two books were below her normal standards, and as I recall, were not all that well received by her fans. I almost feel like George is getting back at her fans by showing us she is the one in control. The way she ended this book is not going to sit well with fans of the Lynley/Havers novels. It puts me in mind of Kathy Bates and James Caan in the movie ""Misery""."
5,Fantastic,"I just finished the novel, but I will not give away any spoilers. With No One as Witness features Inspector Lynley and Detective Sergeant, now Constable, Havers. The story follows Lynley and Havers, along with fellow officer Winston Nkata, as they track a serial killer through London.Elizabeth George's writing and pace are impeccable. The story is so engrossing that I carried the book with me wherever I went just for the off chance I might get to read a few pages. Truly, this is the best book I have read by Elizabeth George yet (and I have read and do recommend all of her novels). If you have not yet read a novel by Elizabeth George, this is a fine place to start. An excellent read."
4,WOW!!,"This is my first Elizabeth George story and it's a stunner. I listened to the abridged CD version so apparently missed a lot but it sure didn't seem like it. Even without a background for the main characters, the Lynley tragedy was overwhelming. I will have to go back and start with book one of the series and do hope the murders are not as gruesome as in this book."
2,She killed off the wrong character,"I have to agree with the readers that label as gratuitous tragedy George's killing off of one of the main characters in this particular entry in the Lynley/Havers mystery series. I might've even condoned a bit of gratuitous tragedy had it only been the unbearably annoying Deborah St. James who got the ax. I don't know about you all, but I want to spew every time Mrs. St. James whines, cries, or pouts, which is every time she makes an appearance in any of the George novels. I have to wonder if George set out to create the most annoying character on Earth.That aside, the twist with the Yard's profiler was down right asinine, something out of a day-time soap. It was a cheap gimmick. Insert mandatory plot twist here.This novel in one word was a disappointment."
3,A little different than i expected...,"i am a big fan of ryan adams...however, i wasn't as pleased with this album as i had hoped. don't get me wrong - It is a good album...but honestly i only love about 3 of the songs."
3,ECK Cetera?,"Generally a strong album, although not very cohesive IMO. Does that equate to diverse? Maybe...One pet peeve... On Track 5, Oh My God, Whatever, Etc...Listen closely. He mispronounces et as eck... Was his producer sleeping, or did they bring this pronunciation foible to his attention, and he decided to leave as is??? Some would say this adds ""character"" to the song. To me it's like nails on a chalkboard.Halloweenhead's a great tune though..."
3,Entrepreneurial Finance,"It had good information, but some of the concepts weren't thoroughly explained. The terminology used isn't consistent with accounting terminology, so it makes it difficult to keep things straight (considering both finance and accounting cover a lot of the same ground for similar reasons). It's definitely more appropriate for more advanced levels of finance, but not so much for a finance introduction."
2,Skip this one.,"I want to start out by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Lupica's other works, but this one is not one I would ever recomend to anyone. The story is well written and has his signature style, humor, and plot twists; but was way too disturbing for my tastes. If you want this story watch an episode of Oz. If you want a really good read stick to the Peter Finely or Jack Molloy series."
2,"Strong Concept, Weak Execution!","The basic concept of Lupica's latest is a strong, i.e., hazing and murder in a small town. However, Lupica's execution of the plot is fairly slow-moving and predictable, and his characters are devloped with little depth. They are one-dimensional at best, making it difficult for me to care much about what happened to them. Given the blurbs from two authors I like a lot (Harlan Coben and Robert Parker), I had high expectations for Too Far and had moved it to the top of my ""to-be-read"" list. As you can see, though, from my comments above, my disappoint in this book is obvious and I will not be rushing out any time soon to read another book by Lupica. Do yourself a favor and skip this book."
2,mildly entertaining but predictable,"The cover blurbs mentioned ""plot twists"", ""mystery"", and ""suspense"". In fact, it's very linear and (spoiler alert?) everything happens EXACTLY as you think it will. I kept waiting for the twists but they never came. I like books about athletes, athletic team dynamics, and youth sports issues, so this looked appealing. Not a bad read, but pretty ho-hum."
4,Not bad,"Considering this is Lupica's first suspense/mystery novel, I thought it was pretty good. Picked it up on a bargain rack for 99 cents and couldn't put it down. I say it's worth the money. As for all of these people saying this isn't real life and that he should write about real life situations and problems, they have obviously never been on a team because hazing is real, and sometimes it does go this far."
2,Can be moody,"I bought this printer for my office. I'm having a rough time with printing envelopes. I cannot put in more than one envelope at a time. It's frustrating. Also, sometimes the machine just freaks out and it's a whole bunch of pressing the cancel button to get back on track. Haven't used it for scanning! I guess if I had to do it over, I may NOT have purchased this machine. It's good for BASIC printing...and basic printing alone and I would have been happier with a simple laser printer rather than this gizmo that acts up frequently... The paper feeder on the top gets hungry at times and you wonder what's going on..."
1,Yes . . . BUT . . .,"In a Windows XP world, THIS all-in-one is terrific and I have had two in our office for . . . well, four or five years. BUT, if you intend to operate in a Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8 world, STOP NOW!5-Stars in XP . . . 1-Star in every other Windows OS.For those of us who have held on to this good printer/fax/scanner, the problems abound outside XP. IF you want to understand the tip of the iceberg, follow along in this HP forum: [...]HP has just abandoned software compatibility outside XP."
1,HP 3390 guzzles toner,"This HP 3390, like all HP lasers that I have used, does a fabulous job in printing. However, this model blows through toner cartridges like prunes through a goose. We replaced an old HP 1200 which used about 1 cartridge every 4 to 6 months, with this unit that is now only making it about 3 weeks to a month on toner.Scanning is fine. Copying is fine. Faxing is just fine. NO problems with any of it. But if we don't find a solution to the excessive guzzling of toner, it may be too expensive to continue to use as a printer. And just so you know, we have decreased the density and resolution in an attempt to save a little, but I have not seen a difference in the toner usage."
3,Good if you are just starting an XP Web Project,"I would recommend this book for anyone who is NEW to XP and is starting a web project. The authors do a good job of explaining the XP process in the context of web development, but you should always start with the ""white"" book, _Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change_ by Beck.However, as an experienced XPer, I did not find anything new in this book from an XP point of view and a lot of the tweaks to XP that the authors discuss, we also did on my XP web development project."
5,Works as advertised,"This stuff is really handy for trim and moldings. No more miter clamps! The bottle even lasted for a year inside my hot van interior, which is not the ideal place to store it! The activator last longer than expected if it's not over used."
2,A big disappointment.,"""Steal Away"" was not what I expected. I expected more adventure and bonding between Beth and Susannah - I couldn't quite understand if they were true friends or mere acquaintances who went through a trying experience. The concept of going back and forth from the ""past"" to the ""present"" was interesting and different, but couldn't save this book. The relationship between Mary and Free was also confusing. I came to the conclusion that they were not fond of each other, because of Free's bitterness. The beginning and ending letter added to the confusion and the ""unspoken"" words and emotions made me reread paragraphs to fully understand what happened. The plot and the way the story was constructed was enjoyable, but the writing style used by Armstrong was annoying. I do not recommend."
2,This book was ok,"This book was boring and swithes between years, which confused me, and wasnt very entertaining. It was basically the same thing all the way through the book. There are much better books available."
4,Great adventure made with adequate preparation and knowledge,"This is a memorable book. Ms. Dodwell is an Englishwoman with a great sense of adventure. Building on her childhood knowledge of Nigeria, and her earlier horseback trip through the Camerouns (Travels with Fortune), she made a major ultra-light trip right across West Africa. She then wrote a fascinating book about the trip."
1,Wishing there was a **NO** star review,"Well...i must say Mr. Kouri has taken Books to a whole new low, it was not even the slightest bit interesting to a lay person or a crime expert, if you want to read a really good writer about crime, i would suggest a book by Robert K. Ressler, he is a seasoned fbi veteran and has in depth knowledge, this fiction writer needs to hang his hat up."
3,Inept Translation,"I am sure the translator is a native Czech speaker, which is half what's needed. The other requirement is someone with facility with the English language. That's not to be found in this Kindle version of War With the Newts. The Kindle book is cheap, but I'd pay $9.99 for a competent translation."
4,"Hard to get into, but enlightening and worth it!","I had to read this book years ago for high school and dreaded it because it sounded boring (no offense). However, I was pleasantly surprised to read such an interesting yet intellectual book. I think that you would have to be a politics, economics, sociology, psychology, biology, and english expert to get all out of this book that you possibly can. The seemingly outlandish plot of newts overtaking the world somehow loses its ring of fiction during the course of the novel and a reader begins to see how it all happens. You begin to question human history and where are we headed. The sarcasm and wit it takes to write such a page turner is true talent ( not to mention the insight of culture). Don't be mislead like I was and pass it by- it is worth the time to read"
1,Couldn't finish it,"I'm a very avid reader and I tend to be open-minded when it comes to books. By the time I got half way through this book, I didn't care anymore. The story went on and on and on and... well you get the picture. I was really disappointed because this had so many good reviews."
3,Could be better,I mean don't get me wrong the book was well written but I felt I had to drag myself through it. I was really hoping to see some demonstration of the girl's so called powers but that wasn't until the end. The thing that really repulsed me was the description of perversion amd sexual urges. Those scenes made me flip through those pages quick. And the action scenes were very short with miner details. I don't want to have to drag myself through that book again.
4,A great romance. . .,"A great romance. . .but the whole thing with the dragons was a big disappointment. I don't want to give the end away, but the part when they release them I found was very confusing. One thing that really bothered me is that it was very difficult for me to invision the dragons. The adjectives used for their description were too vague.The romance part was great though."
1,Don't bother,Just not worth it. This author keeps repeating the same formula and it's not working anymore.
3,Mixed Feelings,"Although I found Hersey's novel to be somewhat touching, I am not fond of his writing style. His detached, journalistic view creates an emotionless mood. Perhaps this style was effective with some readers, but it didn't go over with me. Maybe I have a preference for flowery writing, but I found that Hersey's gruesome details of peeling skin and oozing puss made me sick rather than sympathetic. When the author shows no emotion towards a situation, it is difficult for the reader to do so. Instead of focusing on the emotions, thoughts, and feelings of the survivors, his story centers on the technical aspects of their survival. The reader feels sympathy toward the survivors because of their situations, NOT Hersey's portrayal of them."
3,8th Grade Review,"This book is about the nuclear bomb that dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. It's about a handful of people who survived the bomb and how they helped other people to survive too. They go through lots of pain and sickness but still survived to tell about it, at the end of the book it has the characters from the book (who were based on real people) real eye-witness accounts from them personally. This is a good book if you are learning a bout World War 2 or learning about the effects of the atomic bomb."
4,A must read for anyone interested in the Hiroshima disaster,"What we covered in History class just didn't cut it... We were able to cover why events happened and how they developed; however only this book has given me the TRUTH on how it affected Japan's citizens and later on, how it affected the hibokusha. If you haven't read it yet, its time to."
1,Aarg,"Hardest book to read. My daughter had to read this for school and it was painful to get through it. There are way too many details about things that don't seem relevant to the story. I had to read it out loud to help her understand and even as an college-educated adult, I struggled.We will have to learn about this piece of history in a different way because this book didn't leave us feeling that we truly understand it."
1,ZZZZZZZZZ,This book put me to sleep everytime I read it. I am sorry but this book had no climax or anything that would reach out and grip you. I would not recommened it.
1,NOt good at all mrs. b,we had to read this for La talk about torture! It had to many point of views! BBAADD
5,A stern warning from history,"John Hersey's account of the aftermath of the first atomic bomb stands as a warning for all time. The vivid and sickening first person accounts should cause any reader to question whether resorting to nuclear force is ever justified. In my mind, the bombs dropped on Japan WERE justified because of Japanese war atrocities, the tremendous casualties the allies would have suffered from an invasion of the Japanese home islands and because before the Hiroshima bomb was dropped, no one knew for sure what it would do. The horror of Hiroshima and Nakasaki is partly responsible, I think, for the fact that no atomic weapons have been used in warfare since then. The images in this book will stay with you long after you've put it down."
3,It is about six people who lived through the Atomic Bomb.,"To me, the most compelling moment in Hiroshima is when a mother of three children dug desperately to free them from the rubble after the bomb hit. Her name is Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura. She had two girls, Yaeko and Myeko, and one boy, Toshio. At the time of the blast, Mrs. Nakamura was in the kitchen cooking rice, and the children were in bed going to sleep. After all of the rubble fell on top of them, Mrs. Nakamura immediately started digging herself out of the rubble. Once out, she heard her children crying, she began to dig them out. Everyone was fine except for a few scratches. This is just one of the many stories that are told in this factual book. Hiroshima is touching, and it gets in depth about each of the six hibakusha survivors. However, it is a dull read, and it gets confusing when it skips around from person to person."
3,Missing Chapter,This particular edition is missing the 5th chapter. My son ordered this book for a college history course and couldn't use it. We had to find a later edition that included the missing chapter.
3,"Decent read, but not riveting","A classic, worth reading. Really conveys the terror and bewilderment after the bomb was dropped. Interesting study of various characters involved. Feel does not put the bombing into perspective...ultimately saved American and Japanese lives. Agree with other reviewers that may be too apologetic. At the same time makes a nice case for nuclear restraint. Easy to read in 1-2 days as was originally a magazine article."
3,A Veeerrrrryyy interesting ending,"From Russia With Love has always been one of my favourie James Bond films, but I know that a lot of the movies have very little in common with the books whose names they share. In this instance though, the film followed the book very closely. The villain has been changed from SMERSH to SPECTRE, but otherwise the plot is very similar (although Bond doesn't appear until a third of the way through), up to the last chapter. Much more espionage oriented than later films, where Bond becomes a virtual superhero, the novel is very fast paced and enjoyable, with memorable characters. The film is great, but do yourself a favour and read the book. I gave it 3 stars rather than 4, because the story is entertaining, it is somewhat slight."
3,good but not great,"This is a nice blanket but is definitely not the best for the price. Its just not as soft as I had hoped for, I didnt like the texture too much, even after washing. After about 2 weeks of owning this blanket I found one for the same price that was MUCH nicer, so this guy is packed up with the rest of the extra stuff."
2,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed in this blanket. Having purchased many Korean mink blankets in Korea, I was very disappointed in this mink blanket made in China. It is not close to the quality of the Korean made blankets. This mink blanket is much lighter and no where near as thick and heavy as the real Korean mink blankets. Had I known this blanket was going to be as lightweight as it is I never would have purchased it."
5,Softest blanket.,This faux fur blanket is the softest blanket I have and the coziest. I am so happy with the product. A++
1,Wonderful stories -- terrible edition,"Dunsany's stories are lyrical and meant to be read aloud to grownups in front of a fire. I am setting out to read everything he has ever written. But I would advise you to steer clear of this very poorly edited edition. There are repeating paragraphs, spelling errors, erroneous word replacements . . . all of which interfere with the beautiful rhythm of Dunsany's writing."
2,Good Story bad heroine,"I enjoy stories about Texas and this was a good one from that aspect. I was fine during the first half of the book and then Callie's stubborness was just too much to bear as it began to look like that aspect was going to continue to the end of the book. And, guess what? It did continue until the last few pages. That was too much for me as I couldn't even like her anymore. The other problem I had with this book was the poor or very little editing. There were so many words spelled incorrectly.I do understand the good reviews it received but to give 3 or 4 stars I expect a little more than what I received."
4,Waiting for more!,"What a nice first book for what promises to be a series! JJ gives the Romeo and Juliet theme a contemporary Texas twist, with two families at odds and two lovers caught in the middle. The amount of hard luck sustained by the heroine's family almost broke my heart - and the relentless meanness of the hero's father was both believable and scary. I liked the amount of information woven into the narrative, about the ""horse trade,"" because it gives the story depth and roots. I liked this book and look for more to the story!"
2,Disappointed,"I found this book highly entertaining in some chapters, but ultimately I felt deeply disappointed in its value of helping me understand the inner workings of running a hedge fund.Further, as mentioned in David Jackson's review, I also grew doubtful of the author's grasp of macroeconomics as I read his theoretical musing in certain chapters."
2,not as good as his other book...,"What made Wall Street Meat entertaining were the personal anecdotes regarding his contact with various well known personalities. This book starts in a similar vein, with stories about his efforts to raise money for his hedge fund. Then the book seems to completely lose its focus. It turns first into a high level history of the industrial revolution in England, and then into an economics lesson. The history is circumstantial and of questionable relevance. The economics is pure poorly thought out drivel. This stuff goes on for chapter after chapter. Had I written a review after the first few chapters, I would have given the book four stars. After finishing the book, I think I'm being generous giving it two stars."
2,"""Running..."" of the Mill","I read a LOT of financial storybooks, and this one is nothing exceptional: the author seems more interested in historicaly references than factual tales of beating the bushes for clients and investment ideas. Sometimes felt as if I was re-reading a history book versus a financial tale, which is what I expected to be buying.Nothing Special."
2,disappointing,The DVD was disappointing to me in that it didn't go in depth into Varela's thinking. It was interesting to learn more about his life but that wasn't what I was hoping to find on the DVD.
1,Worst shipping experience immaginable,"I am still waiting to receive my 16"" woks from this company and it has been over a month. They just said standard for the shipping type. I will never deal with this company again."
2,"""Superior Communications""?","I ordered two of these, one for me and one for my wife. Between the two, I didn't have enough parts to get a whole one! Each was missing a leg, and one had a broken leg. I really don't understand how a leg could be broken in the box. However, it is pretty easy to look at it and see that the legs would easily break once installed, due to the thin plastic at load-bearing points. A friend bought one and it lasted two days before breaking. Not good."
4,Cool Mount,The Nady SSM-3 Shock Mount did what it should do. I have a off brand Mic and the mount holds my mic as if it was designed for it. The shock technology prevents the extra noise that I normally experience during recording if the mic enconter movement.
2,too much the writer and too little the friend,"Becker does not seem an empathic, loyal friend of the late poet.She uses gimcrackery effects to sell better her story:""The exaggeration taken with her suicide makes it too probable that her final act was(...) dedicated to Posterity. Too much the writer and too little the mother, did she gas herself because the story she invented for her life demanded that ending?""What about a deeply suffering woman, likely with post partum depression in the last months of her life, who was desperate?"
4,Really tasty for a diet book,"The recipes in here are almost all simple to make and very tasty. The desserts were all surprisingly satisfying. I wouldn't say they were to die for, but this IS a diet, after all! We enjoyed the meals we fixed based on this book, and the weekly menus were very helpful. If you live in North America and are interested in the Montignac diet, definitely get this book and not the original cookbook! In the original, almost every recipe calls for ingredients that are not readily available here, but this North American adaptation uses mostly standard ingredients."
4,Really good fiddle dance music,"Enjoyed the music. Great fiddle swing music, and I couldn't believe he could play that fast on one of the songs. Good dance music."
1,Nope!,This product doesn't work on roaches. I've seen them walk right up to this device and stand next to it. Another dream crushed.
2,Okay muckraking.,"This book is your usual stuff about spoiled Hollywood stars, but with a political bent. It focuses mostly on the ones who recently supported Clinton or were against the Iraq war (Streisand, Penn, etc.), leaving out notable conservative ones that are just as capable of throwing hissy-fits or temper tantrums..."
3,Excel Saga...,"If you're into anime, you might like this. I found it a little...strange. Funny, sometimes hilarious, but still...Three stars!"
5,useful study guide,"This book was found to be very helpful by providing several narratives which give the serious bible student insights into the whole range of interpretations that can be taken from the Book of Revelation while also providing guidance for resources that are available for more in-depth independent study. Four parallel narratives, presented in a chapter-by-chapter basis, allow easy cross-referencing of different perspectives on the various topics."
5,Revelations,Great resource for knowing 4 views. Good understanding but not easy reading. A great book for the lay person. Highly recommend
4,Catch Me If You Can,"Frank Abagnale jr. is a criminal master mind. He finds quick scams to make fast large amounts of money. For him to scam, he must study and plan out how to do so with out getting caught. Like a tiger studing a deers moves before he attacks. Abagnale started his scamming at a young age. His first victum was his own father. He faked many important jobs. It was his way of survival on this earth."
4,Best Con Artist Story I've Read,"A very interesting read about the ultimate con artist. The author's writing style is the only reason this book doesn't get five stars. He is a big fan of bad puns and and using sentences like ""New York has more beautiful chicks than a poultry farm."" Further, the author never misses the opportunity to remind you of his sexual prowess. These shortcomings aside, this was a terrific read. His cons become more elaborate and unbelievable. Highly recommend this one."
5,Fantastic and Incredible!,"This book is wonderful! Prepare to be amazed - this is a person who faked being a pediatrician, a lawyer, a pilot, and even an FBI agent! He now teaches others how NOT to be scammed - I have heard him speak three times (twice for the American Bankers Assn, and once for the Aid Assn. for Lutherans), and he is never dull. GET THIS BOOK!"
3,True Stories are the best,"After seeing the movie, I had to read the book to get the whole story! Though it lagged in some areas, it was definitely captivating when he spoke of the French prison and the way he escaped from jail in the States. Definitely would recommend it!"
5,The only book I have purchased twice.,"This is a great book. In the eighties, when this came out in paperback, I purchased it and read it in less than a week. I looked for my old copy, couldn't find it and then recently purchased a hard cover copy of this book again. It is the same enjoyable read it was in the eighties. For those looking for an enjoyable read, this book is it. The movie pales in comparison to the actual book, since many of the most humorous stories are left out of the movie. One example is the bank deposit box being broken, and please deposit your money with the fake security guard. What a laugh. This should have been put in the movie.Abagnale is a true con and this book is so well written. For a true adventure story that flows smooth, this is a great book. I recommend this book--Five plus stars."
5,"""Catch me if you can""","This book was very very god! It seemed to be a biography/story, a type of book that I have never read before. Soe of the things in the book seem unbeilievable, but it is all non-fiction. The way the story was told also makes it easy to read, but there are alot of flashbacks from when he was oyunger to the present time the book is set.(2) strong points of this book would be1. The book was written well in a genre easy to read2. It is fun to learn about the amazing things that Frank Aagnale, one of his names he had in his lifetime did.(2) weak points of ""Catch me if you can""1. To many flashbacks2. It begins slow, but as you get further into the book, it becomes more and more exciting.I would recomend yuo buy this book, it is a awsome book, and it is written by the person himself, about his life story/biography."
5,Amazingly Interesting True Story,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. For non-fiction fans, this book is a ""Must Read"". The book proves that truth is stranger, and more interesting that fiction. Frank Abagnale is one of the most interesting characters that I have ever read about. His life of deception is truly amazing. He impersonates a commercial airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, and more with amazing results. His intelligence and creative thinking keep him one step ahead of the law for years, while he lives the life of a successful professional when, in reality, he is not yet out of his teens. His ability to outwit others is hilarious and scary at the same time. I'm happy that Frank is now a letigitimate financial success and I can't wait to see the new movie based on the book. The movie is scheduled to come out in December, 2001."
2,Fast reads leaves you craving substance,"The story pulls you in immediately and moves right along, but you soon become aware that you are actively spending time and money to listen to a liar. This makes you feel like his current sucker. The decsription of banking procedures at that time are interesting, but by the end of the book the complete lack of either introspection or interst in another human being make it all just a long-winded boast. It left me wanting to read an account of the same material written by someone else."
5,Great book,This was a very fascinating and fun read but entirely different than the movie which I thoroughly enjoyed as well. That's why I bought the book. I would say the movie is very loosely based on this book. I highly recommend both to anybody who likes fun and wants a good laugh.
1,"his biggest con yet -- posing as a ""writer""","The writing in this book is horrifically bad. Don't believe me? Read the first two sample pages provided on this site. I would call the writing moronic, but that would be too unkind to the morons of the world.Another problem is the story itself. The man opens his book with a tale where he risks the lives of some 140 passengers on an airliner, as he is at the plane's controls, though doesn't know how to fly. Yup! This is something to brag about.Then, on the same page, the author boasts of milking innocent people out 2.5 million dollars by age 21. Quite an accomplishment. And to think most of us only get through college by that age.Imagine if Mr. Abagnale devoted his life to, say, selfless, noble undertakings for no reason other than doing good. Now that&#65533;d be something to write about."
5,Couldn't put it down - Fascinating!,"This book will have you rooting for the bad guy! He is larger than life, smooth-talking, and above all, gutsy. You won't believe the things he comes up with to get himself out of trouble - if I remember correctly he escaped from police custody 4 times (using 4 completely different tactics). Several reviewers have criticized the book because this guy is arrogant, but so many of my favorite stories have characters (like James Bond) with big egos, so I loved it. Truth or fiction? I don't know, but either way, it is a fun read. Enjoy."
2,Warning this game has problems,"Although this game as reviewed by others might be fun please know that there is NO SUPPORT. The game has a lot of loading and saving problems and there are a lot of people that can not play it on their computers. All of the sites for this game say that eventually they will come up with a patch to fix their serious problems but that has not happened yet. You may be buying a game that you cannot play. Their only advice is to play something else until, or if, they get these issues resolved."
1,Disappointment,"Don't be fooled - Fable: the Lost Chapters is nothing more than an expansion pack (and a pretty limited one at that). I got this for my husband because we both enjoyed the original Fable, despite its shortcomings. From the way this one was marketed, you'd suppose that it was the same world, same character, with some new adventures. Instead, it's the same game with just a few added missions tacked on at the end. You have to play the entire game over again (can't import an old game from the first Fable) and in the end, for all that work you've done, you get just a few new missions. Not worth it at all.So - if you haven't played the first, go ahead and get this one - it'll be fun. But if you have played the first, don't believe the ambiguous packaging promising something new - if you want new adventures, just get a new game."
4,Great game!,"For a 2005 PC game, this one has a lot to offer for the casual gamer.If you are into MMORPGs, this one won't do it. But for offline rpgs you'll find that this game has many advantages:* Be good or evil. Your choice.* Great background history.* Side quests both fun and interesting.* Customizable character (during the game).* Interesting features that many games won't have like getting married, buying houses for rent, getting a divorce...of course these are optional if you are more into the slashing enemies business.The only cons:* You can only use a male character.* The newest games have many more features (this one is kind of old).* Lack of moves/magic/abilities compared with other games."
4,Neat but addictive,"this is definitely a must for a first person game. when you get to be too good or bad your character will have stuff that sometimes fools your vision. If you like doom and Knights this is definitely a great game. the graphics are good, it does not get horribly dark like doom. the progession is not entirely linear, it reminds me of Black and White with the story parts and the extra parts. Just be aware that this game will suck you in and not want to let you back out, so start playing while you have a free day ahead because you will need it!"
1,Not The Quiet Amaerican,"Reading this book was like watching paint dry in 100% humidity, only slower. Rather be reading The Quiet American, Power and the Glory, or especially the Lawless Roads a second or third time any day."
4,Africa,"I read this book while traveling in Africa. It is an amazing work. Greene's insight into everything from a bad marriage to the streets of Freetown, Sierra Leone are moving, accurate and powerful. Well-worth the time to read."
3,Not the best Greene,"I am a fan of Graham Greene's work and I read this because I was currently going through the books on Time's 100 best novels list. I could think of some more of his better works to put on the list than The Heart of the Matter. The ending seemed ridiculous. I prefer Greene's non-""Catholic"" novels and the Catholicism in this one just seems too over the top. The protagonist just doesn't seem to add up. Setting the novel in West Africa does nothing for the plot or atmosphere of the book. It could have taken place in any generic setting. I felt this was also the slowest Greene I have read.If you're looking for a Greene ""Catholic"" novel I would recommend The End of the Affair, otherwise The Quiet American or Our Man in Havana."
4,Just like the song,"I read this book because I heard someone say on the radiothat Don Henley's (former Eagles band member) song by the same title (Heart of the matter) was written after Don read thisbook.I don't know if that's true, but if you've ever heard the song, it has the same exact theme of the book.It's a book about the various sides of people and how they handle those feelings married with the expetations of others.It's not a light-hearted read, but it's a great book."
1,Somebody ACTUALLY published this. . .,"I just have to strengthen the views of others--don't waste your time with this book! Any first-year writing student could do much better. Each paragraph reads something like this:""What about that drug?"" she asked.""I told you, let me take care of it!"" he snapped. She was confused by his reaction. Did he know something she didn't? Probably he was just tired. But was there something he wasn't telling her? He had so many patients, he was probably just worn out. But why would he snap at her? Didn't he understand how important this was? Was there something he was hiding? Why was he acting like this? She was so confused, but maybe he was just preoccupied. But what was really going on?I don't need my hand held, and neither do most readers. Let us think on our own. I only read this through to the end because I wanted to see how it would wrap up. It was time I could have spent with a more worthy author."
2,"Stains poorly, looks gritty, causes ugly bumps","I used this instead of Elmer's wood filler for my latest project because I thought it might blend in better after staining. It does not. In fact, it is much more noticeable than the Elmers on the pine I stained. The texture is also at odds with the rest of the wood. It looks like sand.The worst part is that after I stained the piece, some of the wood filler bubbled up, causing ugly bumps that needed to be sanded down and restained. This was more than 36 hours after the filler was applied, so it isn't a matter of not letting it dry long enough. I worry that it will still bubble out after I put on the polyurethane. Awful stuff."
1,Are we wizards to guess what application is for?,"Before Amazon used to have the application number for Hella bulbs. Don't know why, they changed it and now people have to guess what application number is every bulb, because it doesn't say. Shame!!! This is no customer service.For all interested in this bulb, this is a 9004"
4,Helps in making sense,"I'm sure there are many who would like to understand better why Scott Peterson killed his wife and unborn son. This author is in a perfect position to help with that process. She is biologically related to Scott and knew both him and Laci fairly well. However, she did not grow up with Scott and is therefore able to have some distance and objectivity. Book is well written and although there is very little actual information that hasn't been available in other ways, this is an interesting perspective. My hope is that, having written the book, Ann can let it go and continue with her pre-Scott life."
2,Interesting,This book has interesting views of Scott Peterson. I think that it was kind of cheesy to write a book about him though. I think it was important for someone on his side to tell the story though. I just wonder about some of the things that supposedly happened. Scott Peterson is a freak!
2,A mixed bag`,"What I found interesting in this book was Anne's deep hurt over Jackie leaving her Several mentions are made of Jackie's kids-the ones she kept and the ones she gave away.It is clear that Anne's therapy has not resolved these wounds and She is still suffering. My heart goes out to her.Her motives in writing this book are unclear to me.I am not sure betrayal is correct though one could conclude that.I think she did like Scott.This book is payback to Jackie as a reminder that Her ""golden boy"" who Jackie actually raised did not turn out so well. A definite hidden agenda is in this book.There is no new evidence but for some reason it is an OK book."
2,Not Impressed,"I have been following the Laci Peterson case since she went missing. I eagerly purchased this and Catherine Criers book when they came out. This 'Anne' comes across as petty and jealous with not as much insight as she portrays. The 33 reasons she gives for Scott's guilt are her own personal feelings, and some already known circumstances. What I got from this book is that Ms. Bird was intoduced to the Petersons in 1998 and hung around for some parties and good times. She decides that she is above them, withdraws, and writes a book exploiting her family. I don't see how she was close to any of them and this book was written in poor tase, I think. I don't think much of the Peterson family and Anne is no exception. They deserve each other.I definantly believe Scott is guilty but his own sister backstabbing him is a bit much. That family has some serious issues."
1,Blood Brother by Anne Bird,"Anne Bird could have and should have asked questions when she had the opportunity. I was disappointed in the way she said she handled her relationship with Scott. All in all the book proved to be anticlimactic and it would have been better to just write all this in a journal or diary. It was mostly about her and her feelings or lack thereof.When I finished reading the book, I said ""What a loser."" Simultaneously Anne Bird's and Scott Peterson's faces appeared in my minds eye."
2,sold her REAL family out,"I did find the book interesting,however the more I read I was shocked by the fact that she involved her REAL parents in this cesspool. I am sure they were embarrased and maybe even frightened. She gave Scott a key to her parents cabin at Lake Arrowhead, plus a key to their home in San Diego. Her husband made it clear to her that he did not want this guy in his house and she would whine ""He's my little brother"". She owed nothing to the Petersons yet she drug her family through this sewer. She admits her marriage is in trouble. Anne you should have thought about the people you REALLY owe something to."
2,Boring,"While the book did not strike me as being written by someone looking to cash in on a tragedy, I have to say that I am not sure what her the author's mission in this was. The title indicated that she had 33 of her own reasons why she believed Scott killed Laci. So I was under the impression that the author would spend time actually talking about these 33 reasons. She did not. She merely mentions a list of the 33 reasons why she believes her brother to be guilty, but doen't really expand on any of them. And they really are not what I consider good enough reasons to write a book much less call it ""33 Reasons why Scott Peterson is Guilty"". It's misleading. So if you think the author has anything profound to say, forget it. Other than that, I thought the book was just plain boring."
3,Let's make some money off a brother I barely know!,"Anne Bird sadly tells a story that is more about herself than her ""bloodbrother"" and her reasons to suspect his guilt. Although, it was somewhat insightful as to what he did while he stayed with her and some of his actions she reported were curious and suprising. The author Anne simply does not have a real foundation for a book. She just told a few naughty things that she knew about her birth mother,Jackie Peterson, and Scott's odd behaviour. Obviously she was in this for the love of money. It is not worth the money. Borrow it from a friend if you feel compelled to read it. Go to the library and check it out. It really is a waste of money and valuable time."
2,Editor: Where were you?,"Although the story was compelling, the writing was horrible, and I have wondered who edited this writing for the author! I think I've seen enough of the Scott Peterson story---it's too bad that poor Laci (and Conner) couldn't have seen the real person he was. As I reflect back on this book, I feel the sister wrote it for publicity for herself!"
4,The Christmas Child,Christmas is my favorite time of the year and I enjoy reading Christmas stories. This story was was very moving. It showed how one mistake can ALMOST completely break up a family and how faith can keep us together.
1,Poorly made garment,"Article, which I have purchased at stores, came in with loose threading all overinferior manufacturing. Amazon, gratefully granted me a credit."
5,sexy,"these panties are very smooth and very sexy, I love them and they are very true to size, it makes me look sexy."
5,Panties that last forever (or almost)!,"I love love love these panties! Especially for wearing under jeans. They are cute and sexy and, as other reviewers have mentioned, fit very well even if you have a little bit extra in the rear. (No riding up over the cheekies)Also, these are made extremely well. I have several pairs that have been in my panty collection for 5 or 6 years and are still going strong. Of course, I don't wear them every day, but you know how some panties fall apart after a couple washings. Not so with these.The only (minor) negative I can say about these panties is that I don't wear them under snug fitting slacks. I hate a VPL, so for slacks I usually wear the jockey no-panty-line promise style 1208. These 2 styles are my go-to underwear for most occasions, work or play."
5,Great Feel!,These are easily one of my fav undies. They fit perfect and are barely visible under clothes..and I like the feel.
3,Not Very Good,"This was disappointing. The poses are held for such a brief time that it's hard to derive any benefit. I estimate they're held for 3 to 5 seconds. It's more of a stretch workout than yoga, and I wouldn't even recommend it for stretching because it's just too superficial. You need to hold the stretches/yoga poses longer than this."
5,Great story and great writing,"I found this title noted in recent biography of Rachel Carson, ""On a Farther Shore,"" by william Souder. ""The Sean and the Jungle"" was a favorite of Carson's. Since I am planning a trip down the Rio Negro in Brazil, I decided to get a copy of Tomlinson's book, detailing his circa 1910 trip from Wales down the Amazon and Maderia River, 3000 miles to Puerto Velho, near the Brazil-Bolivian border. Tomlinson's ship, a 300 foot cargo vessel was the first to successfully undertake the passage. It's a great story and his writing flows like the great river itself."
5,strategic planning,the more important book about the right concept of strategy. This book break the wrong idea of strategic planning like a panacea.
5,Paid for itself already...,"I thought the price of $... was a little steep, but it turns out to be the best insurance policy I ever purchased. Last week I was in hot water with my boss when we couldn't figure out what was going on with the visibility/searchability of some key objects in the directory. I turned to this book and found an answer in about 5 minutes (after spending almost 4 hours battling with microsoft premier support to no avail...)I would reccomend this highly to anyone who works closely with AD - development, architecture, or operations. It is the only book of its kind, and believe me... when you really NEED to know, you will be glad you have it."
1,Columbia womens socks,"The socks came and they were pink and white, not green and white and the size was small petite, and I thought they were size 9-11 so I can not wear or use these socks. I suppose I could return them, but the socks didn't cost that much for the work of returning them."
4,More messed up than FLCL or Excel Saga!,"This has got to be the most messed up show I have ever seen. Take our heroine, 5 year old Milk Chan. Savior of the world. Or something like that. Her sidekicks are a robot with some bad complexes and a green slug-like thing. Stupid requests from the president mean hilarious escapades and horrendous blunders! Follow Milk as she solves the case of the counterfeit money with the portrait of the wrong Olsen Twin! A great watch for the twisted humor enhanced. :)"
2,Let's Be Serious,"I don't know what it is about this series, it looks so funny and interesting and then you watch it and nothing. I'm not sure if I haven't seen it enough or the episodes I saw were the horrible ones but the show really isn't all that funny. It seems to be the same thing over and over again with Milk Chan doing some of the dumbest things on earth. The problem is that the stupid stuff this kid does takes to long to set up and there's no sting to any of the comedy. Notice that there are three volumes of DVD's but Adult Swim only played half of a season so obviously someone agrees with me. The animation is very colorful and eye catching but who needs that when your watching a comedy and you want to laugh. Maybe it will take time for me to get use to Milk Chan or maybe I'm right and it's really terrible."
1,This should be considered a TOY not an electronic,We purchased this camera for our 4 year-old at Walmart but when I saw it on here wanted to warn people that it's very difficult to hook up to a computer and have problems that cannot be resolved through customer service. We weren't expecting much from the camera so I'm not heart broken about this problem but wanted to let people know that if you're expecting QUALITY from this product you will be disspointed. It's much more of a fun toy than something useful.
1,Broke after 2nd day of use,Got this for my 11year old daughter for xmas. The battery door hinge or spring broke and the batteries kept getting ejected out. Which frustrated my daughter because all the data/photos taken are lost. Should have payed more and not invested in a toy camera.
1,"HORRIBLE CAMERA-DON""T BUY!!","This camera is cr*&. We bought this because we thought it wold be easy for our 4 year old to use. The screen is small and grainy. IT also doesn't move quick enough with you to see what you are photographing. We never bothered taking pictures, because the camera operation is so horrible. I would NOT recommend this to others and the manufacturer should not be selling this. We decided to buy her a real camera and not deal with the cruddy kids cameras."
1,junk junk,this camera is a total piece of dowah. do not buy it. I opened the battery compartment to check the batteries and lost all of my daughters pictures.
3,Digital Camera,I guess for under $30 This wasn't a bad deal. The photo shop that comes with it is cool for kids. The pictures just don't turn out very clear. Was shipped fast.Happy with that. Overall a decent purchase.
5,outstanding,"I enjoy smooth jazz, Paul Hardcastle has the right music.. Im trying to collect hisrecordings he has recorded...I listen to xm radio and watercolors channel, they play paul hardcastle quite often....thank you"
2,Disappointment. Not worth the price!,"Has three rather similar performances, no one very different from the others except for her outfits. All dances are performed in front of a tall armoire so that distinguishing Serina from the background is sometimes difficult. View from three angles is nothing more than two re-runs. Found it moderately entertaining but the ""entertainment"" section is over very quickly. Much of the DVD is spent naming family members and friends from either Egypt or Brazil and listing all of Hossam Ramzy's productions and where to buy them failing to indicate whether they are CD's or DVD's. I will relegate this one to the shelf along with future ones that are promised."
3,a good game,"I thought this game would be good, after all it's for XBOX 360! But, the graphic dissapoint me. I thought they would be better. The game play is fun and it has a nice story line i just wish the graphics were better."
4,Fun Game,Game worked great and it as fun! Only problem was it didn't come with the art work but it doesn't matter.
4,"Gun, could have been longer.","This was a very fun game with great graphics and gameplay. The only problem is that this game could have been so much LONGER! It was way too short, and I am going to be mad if there isn't a GUN II !!"
2,Not new and not about joy,"Readers who hope to find in this book a how-to manual of gay sex will be very sadly disappointed. Rather it tries (unsuccessfully in my opinion) to be an ""encyclopedic"" reference from A to Z (with the emphasis on zzzzzz) on the ""joyful"" life of gay sex, and even then, the book turns out to be only alphabetized, not encyclopedic. Even on those terms it fails. E.g., how can a section about wills be part of the ""joys"". If anything, wills are a problem about being gay, and irrelevant to gay sex, joys or not. I would say that this book is not at all directed towards gays, who I'm sure will know much , much, much more about the subject than has been written here, but towards those who have a prurient interest, are mere gawkers, or who are timidly venturing towards it. If that is the case, none of these groups would be well-served by this book.The text is antiseptic, pedestrian, and boring, and the illustrations are grotesque, not to mention degrading."
4,Frodo's only available costume...unless you make it yourself.,"OK, I was very hesitant to buy this costume after reading the description. But, here we go. It fits the bill. It fits and it doesn't look as bad as I expected. The lapels are a contrasting velvet like fabric, and look pretty good. Lets face it, I could not make this jacket. The cape is a green tweed and adds a bit of authenticity to Frodo. now, of course, you have to get the elf pin and the RING sold separately. I also got a brown wig for the hair. My very picky son if very happy with this costume."
2,"Lots of fun, but lots of system errors","I have owned Hoyle card games for years and I have always enjoyed them, but I have never had so many technical issues before, especially on the Cribbage game and then also on Hearts. (I saw one reviewer has had problems on Spades, but this has always worked for me.) Customer Support is of no help. They told me my system was too old (although it did have the minimum system requirements). When I got my new computer, it stil didn't work. I am so waiting for the new version to come out and hoping that the bugs will have been worked out!"
1,looking for beginner BRIDGE,"Looking for beginers bridge on a disk, I have not tried the product yet. I want to know if it includes the game o bridge"
4,Suspenseful Thriller,"Nicely crafted, creatively written, well acted psychological thriller about two sisters who appear to have an inheritable degenerative disease of the visual system although technically it's not clearly explained how the corrective procedure actually works. How the script writers resolve the suspense, towards the end of the movie, got a little too imaginatively carried away is my major criticism. The storyline reminded me of ""The Caller"" and ""Good Neighbors""."
1,Horrible,"Every legitimate scientist on Earth knows that smoking cigarettes is very bad for people. Anyone who says different is flatly delusional. Smoking has killed hundreds of millions of people. Smoking will continue to kill a billion people in this century. If you smoke, there is a 95 percent chance that you will be one of them."
5,Kid's Love This,"This was my daughter's very favorite book when she was growing up. There was opportunities on every page for her to participate by using each of the resting places. She loved it so much, I bought this copy for my granddaughter."
3,a little disappointed,"you couldn't see the outline of the organs very well and for some reason the picture online looks a lot better than the actually targets. Our targets looked a little pixelated (i think that's a word lol). We still used them, put ended up ordering different targets since we decided that these one's looked a little cheesy and the quality wasn't that great."
4,Anatomy Targets,"These are good targets with indicators for areas of the body struck on each shot. They're dark and the hits aren't that readily discernible at medium and long range. They also require a target backing of some type and a target stand, to keep them from blowing and generally moving around. Good value for the price."
5,Excellent deal!!!,This is an excellent deal hands down! I got my targets a week and a day after ordering it. These are full size targets which surprised me for this price!
5,This book is excellent!!!,This was the most intensive book i have ever read and i do not read that many books. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense or just to read a good book.
3,Great Book For History Assignments,"I wouldn't read this book for fun, but I would encourage reading it for any school assignment, as I did. Crichton has written better (Rising Sun, Lost World, etc.)"
2,Pedantic and plodding at best.,"I usually really enjoy his books. This one leaves a lot to be desired. Not very interesting, plodding and difficult to read. Certainly NOT up to his usual standard of exciting fast moving and enjoyable reads.Was very disappointed in this book."
4,Crichton strikes again!,"I've read this book several times but only now have been able to review it. I have read all of MC's books and find this one slightly underrated. As with all of his books, it is thoroughly researched and told as if it should all be taken as Gospel. Very convincing arguements. Plus, it finishes with a typical Crichton-esque revelation that uts the whole story into a historical perspective. It may take a few chapters until you hit the ""stride"" of the book and get a feel for what is going on, but once you do, you won't be able to put it down!"
2,Eaters of the dead,"In the novel Eaters of the dead Michael Criton really expresses his true emotion by traveling some 500 miles with a strong title of men. In the dessert the men cross numerous vikings including the visous clan and ended up in an all out war. The food supply quickly wore itself down and caused all to go into a starvation mode which drove them into a craze. This craze led them to kill and eat the vicking clan. Once all were fed the went into a village. not to give it away they end up getting there goal and it all lead to the vickings. I do think you will like the book if you have time to reread and consitrate. Michael Criton truly wrote a complex novel and put alot into it. He really makes you feal as though he was a vicking himself.(he wasn't 700 A.D.)If you like the movie 13th warrior make sure you do read this because,he did change it around quite a bit.Michael Criton wrote a Great book make sure you read it!"
3,Not my cup of tea,"I'm a history geek and I love Beowulf and those sort of lyrically prose of the olden days but this was just too boring for me. I finished the book just out of principle but I think this one is overrated.The premise takes quite a while to get under way and the characters are very comic bookish.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I wasn't really involved with the story. Didn't grab me, the style was interesting but not nearly enough."
2,"Crichton, Eaters of The Dead","Eaters of the Dead is something a little different from Crichton and if you don't like what he does here, at least it is a short book and won't waste much of your time. I am one of the ones that didn't enjoy it as much. My reason is simple and pathetic: I do not like this sort of writing style. It reminds me of authors like Charles Dickens. I have attempted and failed to read several Dickens novels and I usually end up hating any book that reminds me of him even if the writing isn't much like his. The presentation of the novel is very well-done though and makes it seem more real. It also reminded me a bit of Congo because it involves ""dark hairy brutes.""In short, Eaters of the Dead gained my respect and not much else but it was still fun to read in some parts and it wasn't overly long."
1,This book is not signed!!!,"This book is not a signed nor autographed book, This book is not a signed nor autographed book, very disappointing,"
4,"Buliwyf is Beowulf, Wendol is Grendel, ...","After reading this book(Korean translation) and watching Beowulf(starred by Christopher Lambert) and The 13th Warrior(starred by Antonio Bandaras)--- all with the same story --- I got more interested in what the original epic of Beowulf reads. About 20 years ago I read a story of Danish hero and now I see it was the Beowulf story. The impression I got then was so strong -- partly because of the splendid illustrations-- and now I'm glad I can get the epic from the web freely, though I wanted a nicely bound copy and ordered it at Amazon.com. I even wish to learn the old English to read it in the original tongue, though it may be much boring. So, this book is a nice and exciting, and feasible retelling of Beowulf, anyway."
2,Still waiting........,"This book will be a dissapointment to Lonesome Dove fans. I did not see character development to speak of, action was absent, plot was thin, and after 400 pages, I was still waiting for some excitement. As part of a 1600 page book (four novels), it might be ok, but not as a stand alone work. I'm glad I only spent the money for a paperback."
4,Good book,Not exactly a novel. There is info on many different electrical sytems along with diagrams. I wish the diagrams were a little bigger.
1,Review by nursing student,"This book was required reading by one of my current classes. Huether's and McCance's book is as entertaining and painful as a root canal. The book is bad about jumping from topic to topic (referring you to other chapters for more information), and tries to make the most basic information worthy of a Nobel Prize in difficulty reading and sheer dullness. The graphics presented ""for ease and understanding"" are so detailed and difficult it becomes almost funny to the late night student reader. The language is obscure and written for the PhD with alot of time on his/her hands to ponder the joys of patho, and not a nursing student. The book does offer an occasional clinical photo to help you with your frequent bouts of narcolepsy. Great gift idea for those you really hate."
2,Giga Ball review,"This was a great idea for my 2 kids for Christmas, I thought. Unfortunately the Giga was a hassle to inflate with about 15 air chambers took close to an hour to fill. Then our first time pushing the kids around with 2 friends (only one child in at a time. Each kids weight was under 80lbs. It is rated up to 150lbs.) the one air chamber ripped at the seams. I now have a giga ball that was used 1 time with duct tape holding one panel together. It ripped on 3 of the four sides holding it together. Most of the chambers are held by 5 seams. This chamber was right by one of the two openings. So my Giga Ball experience was pretty flat."
3,Gigi Ball - Kinda Fun,Got it for my 6 year and she has fun in it but there has to be several others to push the ball......she had fun but it is alot of work to roll the ball around.
3,Great idea...poor execution,"My 8 year old has wanted one of these things since Christmas but they were sold out. When her birthday rolled around a few months ago, I saw where the GB had become available again and ordered one.First of all, the exterior ""honeycombs"" consist of individual air chambers that must be inflated individually. What a pain. Then some of the chambers had holes in them and would not remian inflated. Now you have what amounts to a flat tire on the thing which prevents it from rolling freely.Second, the exterior is not ridgid enough for the GB to retian it's shape as it ""rolls' down a hill. It's hard to keep it going. So it stops frequently, which lowers the fun factor.Lastly, this thing is big, make sure you have someplace to put it when it's not in use.Quality problems aside, this could be fun for a smaller child but my kids just think it is so so."
2,Looks Super Fun but Lasts only a few Hours,"The Giga Ball takes quite some time to inflate. If you don't have a compressor, I would recommend getting one or find someone that does. After you have spent your afternoon blowing it up, your kids will only have a few short hours to play with it because ours had 2-3 holes in it only after an afternoon of play. They give you a patch kit, but your probably better off getting a bike patch kit or something more heavy duty.I figured it wouldn't last since it was relatively inexpensive. Oh well, my girl loved it though."
2,Not very satisfying...,"I'm a reader who enjoys trying to ""put the pieces together"" as I make my way through a good mystery. This book frustrated me by making sudden, jolting turns through the plot and then it pulled the rug out from under me at the end. On the plus side, it's an easy read and suffices for an afternoon of sheer escapism. Think Grisham with a graduate-level psychology degree."
3,Before Rock And Roll,"This CD shows where the ""jammers"" where before the advent of Rock and Roll (and even today!). They were in bluegrass. The speed of the picking on many of these songs would put any rock and roller to shame. The flat-picking and banjo speed are exhilarating and must be listened to. It left me astonished!There are over 60 minutes of music here but with them all being instrumentals and so many of them at break neck speed the music seems to run together after a bit, the only reason I did not rate this higher.But this rates as a very good instrumental project that the older bluegrass fans will remember the tunes and the younger ones will be amazed. Especially that their older family members listened to stuff this rockin!"
3,A Must-Have For Lizzie Fans,"If you're looking for a a fun guide to help you through school, this probably isn't the best choice.But if you're a huge Lizzie McGuire fan, like myself, then this a must-have for your collection.This book features mostly info on the people at school in Lizzie's life, aswell as tips if the same type of people in Lizzie's life, are in yours.Overall, this is an okay book. Like I mentioned, it's great for Lizzie lovers. But not the best choice for a person looking for some helpful guides."
5,Horrible book,"I totally agree with the review below mine. This book was TERRIBLE. I bought it because I thought that it would give me some good advice for school... and it didn't. All it really talked about was Lizzie. It didn't give you advice you can use. It really should have been called, ""all about Lizzie"" Don't buy this book."
2,Not that great of an idea,I thought that this would be a good idea but it was not. The cereal gets old before is eaten when bought in this quantity for an individual. This might work better for a hotel continetial breakfast.
1,Cruelty to Animals,"The book was interesting at first but I stopped reading when I came upon cruelty to animals, a dog. Perhaps I am super sensitve to animal cruelty becasue I had just lost my dog of 5 years."
2,"lacks character development, dialogue, and plot","The best things about this book are the battle scenes and the historical setting. Unfortunately the characters never feel very real or believable. Key characters like Eburovic (Breaca's father) figure prominently in some sections and then disappear from the story even though they haven't gone anywhere. The second most important character, Ban (Breaca's brother), never develops a personality of his own and never feels remotely convincing.Buyers should also be warned that sections of the book include episodes of homosexuality, rape, and sexual mutilation. Some sections are gratuitously perverse, while at other points the book reads like a gay romance novel. This book is definitely not appropriate for children."
4,The Ultimate Gap Band Collection,"While I would have like to see ""I'm in Love"" from Gap Band I & a couple more songs from Gap Band III, this IS the best collection of the Gap Band currently out there. Rather then just focusing on the early (IE Mercury Records) recordings, we get a full look at the band's career up to 1990 (Charlie Wilson's early 1990s solo singles finishes up the collection)"
1,god bless the sheep,"let me just start out with the obvious. IF i could, i would give it no stars. anyone who could possibly say they like this boring, ordinary waste of time is sad. just open up your minds for 2 seconds. just because corporate television crams this down your throats every week doesn't mean you have to fall for it. there are millions of people out there who have great voices. try listening to the clash,velvet underground,the stooges,pogues,p-funk,ozomatli,wire,husker du,or pet sounds(beach boys),electric ladyland(jimmi hendrix) just to name a few.i apoligize for getting so worked up, but its this kelly clarkson clay aiken thing that prevents sheep like yourselves from ever getting to open up your minds & support real artists who sing about things that really matter to them not boring standard covers. thank you"
5,Fantastic,I totally disagree with one review that said Lee Greenwood's version of God Bless the USA was better. His was great too but not better. Both versions are really good. All of the songs on this particular American Idol album are fantastic. This year's American Idol show was much better than last year's. I am no teenager (I am 58 years of age). I am so in love with Clay Aiken's voice. I am glad both he and Ruben received a recording contract and am delighted that Clay is doing so well on the charts.
1,not feeling it,tired of this show but understand it's success&it's charm&appeal. but it's a bit too much&you can find one or two Better vocalists who can take this song out properly.
5,Me,thgis cd is awesome. the american idol singers sang this really good. theres only one song but it is really worth it pus some of the money goes to the red cross.
2,A Little Dry,"While I found the subject of this book very intriguing, much of the actual writing was dry and factual, without enough human emotion or interesting detail.Elaine Goodale-Eastman was a teacher to the Sioux and lived among the native people. She was sympathetic to the traditions and needs of the Native American people. She wrote this memoir many years later, and she seems to have based it on her notes from the time period and her memories. I think this book would have been better written closer to the time she spent teaching the Sioux, perhaps there would have been a little more detail to her stories.I still feel that Elaine's life was fascinating, and I find encouragement in what she was able to accomplish in her lifetime. The story of her life is inspiring, but this book was far from my favorite."
3,Great game,"I still recommend this game to all young children and pre-teens who wish to hone their skills at chess, backgammon or other games such as The Incredible Machine and crossword puzzles."
3,"""A Genius for Self-Promotion.""","So stated Roger Kimball in his immaculate book, The Long March, concerning the subject of this documentary. From everything I've ever read about Allen Ginsberg, the one enduring fact of his life is that he always manifested a genius for self-promotion. The likes of Kerouac and Cassidy detrained into the swamp yet he managed to redefine himself and become one with whatever movement or era would have otherwise passed him by. He was a natural magnet for attention and made full use of whatever talents he had. Indeed, the man surpassed every expectation based on his potential. I thought this was a solid documentary and found the footage of his father to be quite interesting. Ginsberg once boasted that he'd get us through our children, and, based on the cultural devastation that is 2008, events proved him correct. Never underestimate the power of destruction and only fools underestimated Allen Ginsberg."
4,Very realistic and quite interesting,"I thoroughly enjoined this book. Most historical fiction of Rome and Greece revolves around only the greatest kings and generals of the age. This novel with its man in the street protagonist however paints a more intimate and realistic picture of Rome.I found it a little odd that Gordianus has absolutely no familial relations mentioned in this book and no real social relations to speak of either. I felt that Gordianus' familial/social disconnet brought a bit of unbelievability to this book.As far as I could tell, this novel otherwise appears to free of anachronisms yet completely palpable to the modern reader.Despite the fact that with the last 100 pages this book suddenly shifted into slow motion (the second visit to Electra, or the tearing down of the charred house, etc. ""yawn"") all in all, I really enjoyed this book."
3,"I came, I read, I yawned.","Saylor's recreation of a Rome nearly 300 years before the birth of Christ is a treat to the historical lover's eyes. Soaring marble columns, white togas, and references to famous ancients such as Cicero adorn every page. What may not be so appealing in this mystery is the muck of Roman streets, various unclothed Romans engaging in numerous sexual acts, and a several page historical dissertation about the dictator Sulla which has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot. Certain revelations meant to be dismaying are predictable and the detective spends as much time moping around as he does trying to solve the mystery. History purists will also be disappointed that much of the dialogue (excluding exclamations of ""by Hercules!) could have been lifted from any of the many crime shows that dot the TV arena."
4,Roman Blood....a must read!,"Steven Saylor's book Roman Blood is an easy read with an exciting plot that just thickens as you go. One of the things I really liked about this book is that it really kept you interested. Once I thought I had this mystery figured out there was another turn to the story. Finally near the very end I was almost positive I knew how it would turn out but then just like that every thing changed and it is exactly the opposite I thought it would be. Roman Blood was very descriptive and informitive. It gave me a great sense of what Roman life was like and I could almost feel, taste and smell everything through the Roman streets. I especially like the main character, Gordianus the Finder for his courage, secrecy, and kindness. I really enjoyed this book and recomend it to everyone who is ready to take on the mysterious of Roman life."
4,The Boys of St. Vincent,My initial order was lost in the post but the matter was dealt with speedily and very efficiently by Amazon and a replacement was sent out almost immediately.The DVD arrived in perfect condition although I have not actually got round to viewing it yet.I shall have no hesitation in placing further orders on the Amazon sites.
5,Book from childhood,"My husband described reading this book in childhood. I noticed it on Amazon, in Collectible condition, right before Christmas.I ordered the book and paid for expedited shipping. I had the book just in time to open presents on Christmas Eve!My husband is happy to have the book and I appreciate the effort the seller put into getting the book to us quickly!Well packaged, tracking worked, arrived right on schedule.Very happy with my selection."
3,Good introduction,"This is a book for the beginner in WW II' generals. IT provides a good general overview about some of HItler's most famous generals and Field MArshalls, adn tries to explain why they followed the Dictator of Evil into Germany's destruction. THis is exactly the weakest part in this book> the explanations to this fact are very vague. In ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" you'll find much better explanations to the fact."
3,Uneven quality,"It's hard to know how much to trust this book. Walter Goerlitz's whitewash of Keitel, Jodl, and Reichenau (the last being particularly egregious) shows that the editor didn't ride herd on his contributors. So, if you find any remarkable factoids in this book, check them out elsewhere before using them."
4,"GOOD, SIMPLE","We at Film Masters really enjoyed reviewing this film. It is very simple,non-complex romance story, and revolves around 2 time periods (before they met, andafter they have married). We liked it mainly beacause it is simple, has nodeep mysteries or mind boggling special effects. People who see this filmmight view it has having no substance, but this film was not created as a hollywoodblock buster or a must-see world event film. Two guys who never met beforemeet in an awkward moment, then meet again later at a party where they slowlytake off. Another thing we liked about it is this is not a boy-meets-girl, breaks-up-with-girl, and gets-girl-back boring type of film that is so old its not worth to renting.Its slightly different where no one breaks up and keeps you thinking howthese guys ended up like they did.Daniel J. Tyler (The WJ Group)"
1,"More than terrible, it's a crime and should be removed from public schools","This book does not promote any sort of free thought. It closes the minds of gullible people and pisses off the rest of us. I wish I would have known this kind of book would plague my 100 level english core requirement as I would have swiftly dropped the class. I hate to slam the articles within specifically because I have no quarrel with the authors who wrote about their ideas and feelings, but they have no place in a school textbook. They should be thought as Op-Ed pieces and nothing more."
3,Great Way to Increase Critical Thinking Skills,"While this is an excellent book for teaching college Freshman how to write by developing critical thinking skills, I'm neither a Freshmen nor eighteen - my college requires me to take this general breadth course. I would also have given it a higher star reading if it was available as a Kindle download. ATTENTION EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHERS: Get into the 21st century! ALL textbooks should have a digital option."
4,"Relax,its a great popcorn movie.","Space Cowboys is a great popcorn film with a witty and unexpected ending.One reviewer asked ""how did he get to the Moon""? He's supposed to be the best pilot in the world,remember?They set that up when he lands the shuttle by instinct.The film has some great scenes with first class special effects and it's wonderful to see the over the hill gang get together for one more great adventure.Its a good popcorn film,relax and enjoy it."
5,SPACE COWBOYS {BLU-RAY},"So this would probably never really happen. So What !!! I think this is a pretty good movie. It's fun to watch this all star cast. The Blu-Ray is pretty good, especially when they are in space. I am also glad they did this in the 2:40:1 aspect ratio. It gives you a better sense of where they are & you see all of the film, not like in 1:85:1. The sound is pretty good as far as I'm concerned, although I listen through external speakers hooked up to an old stereo system. Did not hear any sort of drop out at all. It has some good special features also: Special Effects: Up close with the Editor: On location with the cast & crew: & an extended version of the Tonight Show scene: & a Trailer. I would say go ahead & get this, I think you will enjoy it."
5,space cowboys,it is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. I liked all the actors in it. they were very funny
1,Space Cowboys,"A highly unbelievable story line. The acting is not good. Kind of like watching a high school play, no heart. Quite a disappointed for a Clint Eastwood, James Garner, Tommy Lee Jones, and Donald Sutherland movie! I expected better!"
2,formulaic,"The movie is a string of pleasant cliches, watchable but forgettable. The actors are pros but don't have much to do."
4,Better than I expected,"I was not expecting much, since I was previewing it before giving it to my parents, but a decent drama. Not much action, but a good story line and good acting, as they are all pretty experienced. ;-)"
3,Great beginning but looses momentum.,"Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and James Garner are the best. The movie had a GREAT beginning where experience/technical history wins over the inexperienced techno kids. Eastwood's character has a history which is the thread through the movie. The best part of the movie is the beginning when Eastwood is at his house and when Eastwood's character brings the four of them together again. Too bad the movie starts to go down hill from there.Where the ""Cowboys"" loose their class and my support is when they start acting ""old cootish"". Even though it was a very predictable movie the ending was good."
4,"Very, Very good movie. Better than I thought.","This movie was a very funny and very well written. I saw this with my wife and another couple and they enjoyed it, probably more than I did. Don't get me wrong it is a very good movie (as if I haven't said that enough). Clint, Tommy, James and Donald all are very funny (espeacially Donald - He thinks he is a sex god or something). I would be suprised if anyone hated this film."
2,Needing Something More,"Let me say something to begin. Clint Eastwood is a very talented director and actor. I have loved his other ventures, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and True Crime. Both were excellent. This one on the other hand was something else. The beginning of Space Cowboys was good. Funny. It has some great star power in the means of James Garner, Tommy Lee Jones, and Donald Sutherland. All are great actors and they made a few good jokes in this film. After the first half, which mainly deals with these older gentlemen trying to get back into shape to go into space, the second half is too dramatic. It stands out way too much than the first half and leaves you with a, ""Why did I just watch this"", kind of feeling. That is just my opinion, but you might want to reconsider buying this one. It is one to watch though."
3,Laugh along with the geezers,"What can be said of a movie in which four geezers are shot into space? The sheer premise alone just about says it all: ""Armageddon"" with old folk.There's the whole theme of resentment from the younger, ""better-fit,"" hotshots. The ""fighting team-mates"" theme (which, of course, means that one of them must die). There's even the ""fledgeling-romance-on-Earth"" theme!Yes, we've seen all this before, but somehow it all seems to work this time around. How could that be? I would give a lot of credit to the performances of, of course, Eastwood, Sutherland, Garner, and Jones. These guys realize that, to some extent, this film is the story of their careers. (If only Harrison Ford had been available!) So they sit back, gear up the punchlines, and let the metaphor work for them.All in all, this is a bit of a mixed bag, but it's worth checking out, if only to laugh along with the geezers."
4,"Yep, It's a bucket of corn, but it's fun","I liked this film. I watched it shortly after enjoying ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and it's almost like a fictional sequel to that factual docudrama. This may be Clint's last gasp as an action star and James Garner is always fun.DVD Extras are cool."
5,Clint Eastwood 4 pack,"This is a gift for my husband, it came in good shape and came very promptly, can't wait to see his face when he opens it!"
5,Touching and funny,"Deep as all Eastwood films, but charming and funny. An Amazing cast too. I have seen it before, but is one of those films that you want to have at hand."
2,Caveat emptor,"The Kindle edition listed here is NOT Harold Bloom's edition. It's a plain vanilla edition of the play. If you are looking for commentary by Bloom, as I was, it isn't there. Cheap but not functional edition of a great play, of which I have several other copies already."
2,It's Worth Reading,"While staying at a camp, Nancy is asked by an elderly woman to locate a stagecoach which had belonged to the woman's great-uncle. The stagecoach is supposed to a contain a clue to something which would be of great help to the town. This book was alright, it's not one of the best of the series, but it certainly isn't one of the worst. The mystery is okay and there is a reasonable amount of action. I wasn't glued to the book with every page, but it did manage to keep me more-or-less interested throughout. This isn't a book I'd highly recommend; although, it is worth reading."
4,Good ole fashioned farm fun,"Bought this toy set for my nephew who could destroy an anvil. This is one of the few yoys I have seen him play with more than he played with the box (if you are a parent you will understand that statment)The tractors are made very well. The building however are just cheap plactic. Im sure they will be the first things to go.A word of caution, do not buy this for younger children, there are many small parts that you will not want them to have.All in all, my nephew will have lots of fun plowing the carpet, and growing ""pretend corn"""
2,Too weird for me,"This album is billed as a meeting of Charlie Hunter and electronica guy Bobby Previte, with special guest on sax Greg Osby.So I figured this would be typical grooving Charlie Hunter jams. Boy was I way off.Beware that this album is very avant-garde and the songs never really materialize. It's just way too experiemental for my taste; it's almost hard to listen to.I really expected better given Charlie Hunter's usually-solid CD's. I guess he's trying to do something different..."
3,I've seen better,"Don't get me wrong, it's a must-have for the reality junkie like myself. However, there's better video out there. There are two or three very good parts to this DVD, but if your friend has it, just borrow it."
2,Not Feeling Good,"A DVD entitled ""Crazy White Boys"" does not make me feel good. I'm an African-American, not White, but that doesn't really matter. I would rather see young Whites placed in a good light, like the ones trying to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina, for example. The title strikes me as racist; that is simply wrong. Don't buy this DVD. Buy something uplifting instead, like the Thomanerchor Leipzig singing Bach's B Minor Mass. Amazon has it."
4,great idea,i would give it 5 stars if my three year old actually played with it. she loves puzzles but has no interest in this one. i think i like the idea more than she does. but overall its a great puzzle for kids who might be interested.
4,home town,"My interest in this book was on two levels. I was born and raised in Hamden, but have been living in the Midwest for the past 30 yrs. It was great fun to see and learn more about the area I call home.My second reason for purchasing this book was because of my Italian ancestry. There was information regarding my paternal grandparents and their general store on St. Mary's street along with a picture of my grandfather. My father John Della Vecchia was very active with the Hamden Historical Society. I was able to view pictues from his collection that were used in this publication."
2,Just couldn't get into it...,"The premise seemed interesting, but the opening of the book dragged on.. and on.. and on.. The same concepts were repeated and rehashed repeatedly, somehow attempting through repetition to become clever, and failing. Glad I got this used, because it's going back to resale without being finished."
5,great help,incredible helpful in my time of mourning the tragic and sudden loss of my loving and incredible son Dominic D.
1,Cooks Essentials (so called Deni),"Deni Electric Food SlicerThis item is horrible,I bought it from bargain outfitter, I couldn't take the blade out to clean it, The reason why bargain outfitter sucks, because they sold me some machine called (Cook Essentials) instead of DENI, they play a bait and switch game, it cost me $30 to ship it back and forth, I went to Target and bought the real thing(DENI),I will never ever deal with this company again( bargain outfitter) nothing was a bargain about them. by the way the real (Deni) has no problemwhen it comes to the blade, because it can be easily removed."
5,"Great product, works wonderfule!","Received this product and it was easy to set-up, use and clean. Eating so much healthier now that we can cook our own lunch meats and slice them on this wonderful machine without the sodium nitrites! Great product."
1,Braking Clays,I'm in a trouble in writing my opinion on this book. I ordered it September 24th 2010 but I still have not received it. My complaints to Amazon are all in vain. Sorry.
2,Umm gets REALLY boring.,"This game may be fun at first but after a while, it is not fun. There is like 2 fun things, blowing heads off, and making these dudes chase after you. The game is really easy."
3,Gamma Review,"Order arrived in time and not damaged. I gave one star for that.These balls are not performing as well as other top brands. A bit disappointing since the price is fairly similar.The wear is not that great either. Uneven and inconsistent. Kinda annoying to open a fresh can, and half way through a game to find such uneven on the balls...Also, I found these balls to not hold pressure as well as comparable top brands...Would not buy again, and would recommend to stick with the top brands."
3,Incoming,"A very interesting film, if not a particularly stirring one. It focuses on the last days of the Israeli occupation of Lebanon, similar to Vietnam for the US, more or less endless with no ability to actually win in any meaningful way at this stage of the game. The soldiers are dug into the heights around the Crusader fort Beaufort. Everyone knows they're leaving, but politics precludes them from evacuating immediately. So, they're just up there as sitting ducks, albeit well armored, fortified ducks, taking incoming mortar rounds, with no ability to fire back or do much of anything beyond keeping their heads down. Fear mixed with boredom, and a big dose of frustratation is pretty much the story, as they never actually see the enemy or fire a single round back, but hang on to do their duty until they can leave. You'll enjoy the film if you're interested in the subject matter or at least familiar with the war, but for many this will prove dull."
4,Must view for those leaving anyplace troops have been for a while,"Leaving Iraq? Leaving Afghanistan? Leaving anyplace sacrifices have been made, friends/colleagues killed/wounded? Different geography notwithstanding, I wonder how much it looks like it does in this film?My haiku take:Leader as father.They want to go. You must stay.Can't stay, gotta go."
3,undescided....,"i love the new song by cassie (for degrassi goes hollywood-cant find it anywhere yet). i was a bit dissapointed with this cd though. i thought all the songs sounded the same, there were only 2 songs that i liked (bluebird & love cost). she has an AMAZING voice just needs some different material..."
5,A beautiful piece of history,I love my mug. Everyone turns when they see it. It is always complimented on. I love my mug. It is very realistic and holds more than emough beverage.
2,Poor design,"We were looking for a knob cover that our 3 year old couldn't defeat. So, we started looking for one-piece covers. It turns out, this is one of the only models that exist in a one-piece.Unfortunately, it will only fit on the smallest of door knobs. In addition, it scratched our knob up sliding it on and off. Finally, the pressure required to turn it is excessive, even for a strong adult. This also caused more scratching.Overall: Would not recommend."
1,HORRIBLE!,COMPANY FAILS TO MENTION THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS POISONOUS PROPYLENE GLYCOL! WHEN IT ARRIVED THAT IS WHEN I SAW THAT NASTY INGREDIENT ON THE LABLE. THIS IS DISGUSTING! I WOULD NEVER PUT THAT PRODUCT ON MY BODY. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!! IT IS GOING IN THE TRASH! COMPANY HAS LOUSY RETURN POLICY AS WELL-BUYER BEWARE! I AM LETTING AMAZON KNOW OF MY DISSATISFACTION. I AM SICK OF FULL DISCLOSURE OF INGREDIENTS NOT BEING LISTED ON PRODUCTS BEFORE PURCHASE.
3,A little too hard for Easy,"I am a beginner, self teaching adult.I find that this book is still too hard for me even after a year of attempting them. I can attempt two handed only two songs so far, but I play the right hand melodies a lot for my 3 year old girl who loves Disney Princess movies.If you are a beginner needing easy two handed items, this one I would say is probably more intermediate. I'll work my way up there, but it's not like the other easy books that I have that it takes me awhile before I get it, but this one I'm still not skilled enough to get to even though I keep trying.I know skill level is subjective, so in the graded books, I am not beyond a level 3, so to be able to attempt all these songs, if you aren't above a level 3 in leveled piano books, don't expect this to be within playing capabilities for you."
1,The 2nd best child molesting musician of all time,"Apparently child molestation does not deter other musical artists from collaborating with R. Kelly. Aside from his fascination for underage girls, his lyrics express the same emotional depth of an Adam Sandler song."
1,Still at large!,"Make money for a large record company and you can stay out of prison for ______ing underage girls! He is so immature and just not all that as an artist. R Kelly should change his name to ""lucky""."
2,What happen???,"I was highly surprised and very disappointed with RKelly's new album. I don't know what he had in mind while making these songs and putting them on his album, but out of the entire album I only liked 2 songs. I'm hating I paid full price for it. I should have just borrowed it."
1,One of THE worst CDs ever. R.Kelly at his absolute trashiest.,"I'll give you 11 adjectives to describe this, and then I will leave:DisgustingDisgracefulDisrepectfulMindlessSoullessTalentlessEmbarrassingRapSorryTrashyI.Q. Killer1 star"
4,Great Topic,"As noted by other reviews, the begining of the book is quite an eye opener. The examples are excellent, but the book lacks focus and deeper research into what is being done by parties to come up with a personal fab lab that as individuals we can, lets say, ""print"" our personalized whole shirts, coats, shoes and beyond and when. What I like most in the book is the idea of teaching students hands on. I hope educators and politicians take this seriously, since hands-on-see-the-result inspires kids to pursue science and technology. It is well worth the money and time to buy and read this book, althouhg it could be much better Maybe a second edition would do it."
1,DISGUSTING THEY USE THE NAME THE SUPREMES,These girls should not be able to get away with using the name The Supremes on this release. The Supremes have offically disbanded. These re- recordings sound terrible and are disrepectful to the name The Supremes..Go find the true original versions and stop wasting good money on these girls
1,"""Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing Baby!""","Don't be fooled everyone!!! these are NOT the original recordings, or original Supremes. Although Scherrie Payne was a 70's Supreme from 73-77 and Lynda was a shrort lived Supreme from 72-73, the other ones were NOT even Supremes at all.If you are looking for nothing but the BEST, stay with the originals....Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard; andfor those who say that Mary Wilson can't sing, hey, who cares, she never said she was the greatest singer, but she was AN ORIGINAL SUPREME from 58'-77' and NO ONE can take that away from her. Don't settle for cheap kareoke imitations, buy the originals."
1,Not the Real Supremes,(...) These are all re-recordings by people who never sang on the originals. The backgrounds are cheesy sounding and the vocals are mostly oversung or bad imitations. Stick to the real Motown product.
5,Very Pleased!,"I was very upset when I realized that I left my old mirror in a motel in TN! In searching for a mirror that enabled me to see up close to put on make-up without my glasses and was set up very much like my old one, I came across this one and gave it a try. I am very pleased with this product. My old mirror didn't magnify as much as the 10X side of this one. Seeing without my glasses is NO problem. It looks almost identical to the mirror that I lost (and had used for many years!) and does a great job!"
1,Do NOT buy this product!,"This is a worst product you can buy.It came with all broken apart in pieces and plastic, not Aluminium. From my experience, 10W does not work that well. instead of this product, buy ""Paradise GL22688BK Low Voltage Cast Aluminum 20-Watt Spot Light, Black"" product. for the same money, you get 20W and Aluminium and works very reliably. --- This is a follow up review as of 1/18/2013. I returned the product with my expenses and I received an e-mail from the seller that I would be getting a refund, but three weeks passed and I saw no refund. Amazon should NOT do business with this company. Worst ever. Disappointed."
1,"Poor quality, unreliable","I installed 10 of these for a client, trying to save him some money. The connectors were very difficult to use. They are flimsy and made poor connections. The bulbs kept burning out and connections failing. Save your money."
3,"It's...okay. Not great, not lousy","Yeah, it works - but not for long. You'll get decent separation of the nasty stuff from the sides of the litterbox for the first two or three days, but after that the effectiveness disappears. It's great if you empty and scrub the daylights out of your litterbox every two or three days, but not everybody does that.Additionally, the effectiveness will wear off if you have an older litterbox that's been abraded by cat-scratches.I'd say in any given week you'll do about 40% less scraping work by using it.Somebody needs to get a nonstick litterbox to market, pronto."
5,Forgotten Gem!!!,Mimi Rogers and Mark Harmon star in this action thriller about a wife(Rogers) whose husband with an shadey unknown second identity mysteriosly leaves her then hiring a detective(Harmon)to find him.It's a gem and a must see that should be on DVD!!!!!!!
1,JUNK,I PAID $165.00 FOR THIS JUNKI USED IT THREE TIMES AND IT BLEW UP WITH WATER COMING OUT EVERY WHERE !
1,cd,The cd that comes with it is so scratched it cant be played so to me the book is useless and I have wasted my money
3,Enjoyable enough for the series,"Completed after Ian Fleming died so not fully his work, but the concept covers Bond's rehab from his amnesia and brainwashing by the KGB and his task to recover face to ""M"" by killing Scaramanga. Much of the plot seems to drag out the inevitable and is not typical of Bond, but does give him a different characterization."
2,disappointed by Bond,"I feel like all of the normal Bond elements were missing from this book. The evil guy is just a simple gunslinger, the world isn't threatened. Sorry I wasted Tim finishing it."
3,Review from the Synthesis,"Already established as a force to be reckoned with, DJ/producer Satoshi Tomiie has released his new mix, ES, on the label he founded. The pace of the CD is set early on with the first 9 tracks bolstering a similar electro house sound. The vibe and pace of the mix changes with the entrance of track 10, a disco house anthem entitled, ""Friday Loops."" ES peaks near its end with ""We Interrupt This Program."" It's the hardest hitting track on the CD and delivers one hell of a punch. ES ends with two vocal tracks bring down the energy and giving the set a sense of closure. Well mixed but a little stagnant, ES will keep house heads happy, but probably won't do much for those into more progressive forms of techno.-Jason CatanzariteSynthesis.net"
3,Wacko blocks,This is an unusual quilt book. If you like symetry and orderthis is not for you. I enjoyed the ideas and new techniques.Service was good.
5,Character building,"I love all the Snipp, Snapp, and Snurr books. This one teaches a valuable lesson on the rewards of giving. My oldest child really learned to read with these books and will still sit down to read them to the younger ones because they are so encouraging. Time spent reading these books is time well-spent"
3,"watch as ""regular"" movie","Well, the first Metzger movie we watched was ""the Image"" needless to say it is BRILLIANT! THerefore we (unfortunately) compare every Metzger movie with this one....(we never can make through the movie ""the Image"" without having sex:-), this movie is ok if you watch it as being a ""normal"" movie of the 70's, don't expect explicit sex scenes and the story is ok."
1,"Well shot, but very dated","If you are looking for very dated, very well shot 70's style erotica, this is it. However, if you are a fan of today's style of porn, this will not do it for you, it didn't for me. Story runs very slowly, and is too out there for me."
5,Does whats needed,I curl my hair a lot so these are super useful for holding each curl until the end and to section out my hair. I had imagined they would have been larger like the salon type I see used but honestly I am glad they are small. This is so convenient for holding each curl and I like to part my hair into several small sections rather than three or four large ones when styling my hair. Its time consuming but these help the curls stay curly for a longer time. My hair does not curl well and by the time I finish one side of my head the others losing curl. I have only used these a few times but I put them in and sprayed my hair once I was done and my hair lasted a lot longer than normal!
3,Not Very Helpful - Relies too much on the help of friends,"While this book may be helpful for someone who has no idea how to do anything for themself, it was not particularly helpful to someone who already has great money saving ideas and wants new, creative ones. Furthermore, most of the money saving ideas involve putting all your friends to work at your wedding. I want my friends at my wedding as my GUESTS, not caterers. She does inspire you to get organized and start thinking, though."
5,Satisfied,I am totally satisfied with the seller. The book I recieved was brand new and it arrived in an acceptable amount of time. I have no complaints. I haven't read the book yet so I can't comment on the story...but check back because I'll definitely update you on my thoughts.
2,For those of you who feel incest is best.,Definitely a six beer or two doobie movie. Promiscuous Mom attempts to get her cute adult son introduced to sex by female friends. This works but only fires up his real desire which is *por mama*. The requisite shame and guilt ensues with fatal consequences. Fairly retarded. Lousy sex. You will really have to hamstring your thinking mind to like this even a little bit. But why bother?
2,NOT EXACTY FAMILY FARE,"Teenager Pierre's father dies in a car accident, leaving him alone with his mother, a sexy, worldly woman. To put it mildly, Pierre has a ""crush"" on his mum. Perhaps unusually or not, given the spate of older women seducing children lately, the mother also fancies her son. Isabelle Huppert is enchanting and self-assured as the mother. Louis Garrel is the come-of-age son. MA MERE takes you into sadism, nudity, sex and incest. Not exactly family fare. Ultimately, MA MERE goes nowhere and, as if to prove that point, offers an alternative ending."
1,worse ever,"don't waist your money. I hated this so called movie. Very little nudity, poor acting and very poor story line"
2,It was alright,"I read it a week ago, and can hardly remember it. The young woman in this episode seems old. It is totally realistic, and as boring as every day life. I would recommend this book to someone who does not enjoy fantasy."
4,Another great series!,I love every book I've read by Charlaine Harris and this one is no exception. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was too short. The book wrapped up everything completely... it's just it took me about 4 hrs to read and I wanted more!
2,Disappointed,"I love Harris's book but I have to sya that I was very disappointed with this one. I thought it had a very interesting premis but it just didn't pan out. Also the editor did a terrible job going over this book. There were typos in the dialogue, parts of conversations just made no sense."
2,I'll stick with Sookie,"Easy and quick read, but a very predictable plot. Was hoping for more twists but I guess that I will just have to wait until summer for the next Sookie book!"
4,Loved it!,"I love the fun and sexiness of Sookie, but I also loved the serious, no nonsense Harper! Can't wait to read the rest of this series."
4,Compelling Read,"The characters are much more interesting than the plot of this mystery. Harper, the protagonist, was struck by lightening, which somehow gave her the ability to hear how people died when she is close to their corpses. She is now in business with her half-brother, Tolliver, helping people find out what happened to their loved ones. One of the strengths of the novel is the siblings' relationship--they are survivors of a very abusive childhood, and take care of each other. One of the weaknesses of the novel is its predictability--I caught on to some of the mysteries hundreds of pages before any of the characters did, and I am no Sherlock Holmes. Nonetheless, this was an entertaining read & I'll be sure to check out the next novel in the series. I do appreciate that this mystery was not too graphic."
3,Predictable.,"Kind of dissapointed. I love the Sookie Stackhouse series and I was hoping for more of that: an entertaining story with no deep meaning or anything to really think about, but fun and sexy.Didn't like the main character, one of those ""Poor me, I've suffered so much and now my brother is tied to me and I can't be on my own..."" It was too much.Also, I knew who the murderer was in Chapter 2 and the new clues the author kept introducing only confirmed it by Chapter 6.There are a couple of typos (I hope they were typos). And at some point she describes one of the characters as""blue-eyed"", while a couple of pages later she says ""she widened her brown eyes"". I know it's not a big issue but it confused me. I went back and I am sure she's talking about the same character, not another one.Why 3 stars then? Because I've read worse and it just needed a bit of polishing. In my opinion it was a bad editing job for the most part."
3,Great Expectations - Not Met,"I was looking forward to this beginning of a new series, as I thorougly enjoy the Sookie books - however I was disappointed. Could feel no afinity for the heroine, along with her brother they spend their life in a colourless & cold world.However having said that, I feel that there is great potential to develop the characters and story lines."
2,Harper Connelly Series,"I've read all of the Sookie series, and love the writers humor, unique wit, and creative style.Unfortunately this seriers is not as fun or uplifting as I'd hoped. The writing is good, the mystery also is really good, maybe it's just the subject matter....finding people who are not lost but dead, beyond hope,most of the people the hero deals with detest them, etc.... I will finish the series because I bought them, but won't buy anymore. Having lost my own child and a husband who deals with exploited/missing children professionally, brought back too many bad feelings."
5,goog but lacking a little,"I think it's a good book. I like how Melanie is becoming better and now has a good friend in Christina. I wish the books went back to Samantha,Tor,Cindy,Max, and all of the old horses. Possibly even follow up on Glory's and Champion's offspring."
1,This is SO pointless,"Why do we have so many books about camp? It's boring and all the same. I don't think the writer is very inspired. I'm not reading these. I refuse to because they are stupid. I might read a few of the racing books in the future, but as far as the jumping stuff, I'm not going to read pointless babble. And if the future racing books are just as petty and unrealistic, I'll quit reading those too. Just because it has some races in it doesn't make it wonderful. May the writer remember that. It has to be more than a few races. Research won't kill you. Your readers aren't stupid, they're unhappy."
3,COME BACK RACING!,"gggrrr!!! I am really starting to dislike these series! I want the old charecters back badly! When Cindy was in the picture, i didn't like her, but now, with Cristina (eeewww), i want cindy back! i also want all of the old charecters back! what happened to samantha, Tor, Heather, mandy, Yvonne, Len, Brad and Lavinia Townsend?, and at least they can keep Townsend Acres in the picture. i mean, thats the barn that started it all! Cristina is really getting on my nerves. She thinks she is so good and she pushes Sterling WAY to hard. Joanna Campbell could've at least made a super edition with all of the old characters come back for a reunion or someting. I think i'll make my own book like that. Can anyone answer my questions?"
2,This has the best plot out of all of the new generation seri,"I think that this is a minor improvement. i know that it is hard to write books as i have written two and am halfway through another. sometimes the words flow like a river does but other times it takes you five hours to write a paragraph and then you delete it and start again. but these writers are writing from the part of their brain that doesn't do any work. the plots were getting worse until now. i got christina's courage and dumped it in the bin after i read it. don't pay out Joanna, she hasn't had anything to do with the change in the series,in fact she was surprised when they came out like this. Don't pay her out and hop[e for the best."
3,Melanies Last Ride,"In Melanies Last Ride, Melanie Graham, from New York is having a great time with her cousin Christina Reese and all her new friends at Camp Saddlebrook. Christina and Melanie went to camp for 3 weeks to learn more how to ride. But with everything going on at Saddlebrook, Melanie might have to leave or her father might take her back to New York. Somebody was pulling pranks on people and mixing up tack to get melanie in trouble. If this keeps happening, Melanie probably have to move back to New York forever and leave Christinas pont Tribulation and Pirates Treasure, the retiered racehorse. Melanie knows she cant leave Whitebrook farm, the famous racing and breeding stable in Kentucky. Can Melanie find out whos pulling the pranks before she has to leave for good? Find out in Melanies Last Ride.(...)"
3,I have not read it.,Allison estes should get off the stupid subject of snot-faced Melanie and got back to Whitebrook! She should not write ANY more STUPID books about Melanie!!!!
4,Good product,I am happy with the car charger I purchased. It works well and arrived pretty quickly. Thanks
1,Total Junk - Lasted less than a week,Installed this battery into a 3Gen iPod. Charged up played just fine (for a week). Now will show full charge but charge only lasts for about 30 minutes.Don't waste your money.
5,Near-fatal attractions,"A psychologically-intricate exploration of the power of sexual attraction. Fanny Price has barely enough integrity to keep her attraction to cousin Edmund under wraps; Edmund, meanwhile, is so utterly transformed by his desire for Miss Crawford that he pretty much pimps Fanny out to Miss Crawford's licentious brother.Austen's bleakest work, Mansfield Park is a meditation on both the demonic power of sexual desire, and the fragility of any morality that simultaneously celebrates physical beauty AND tries to regulate the bewitching effects that beauty has upon all of us.And if you're paying attention, you won't be fooled by the all's-right-with-the-world, David Lynch-like ending, either. Indeed, the center does not hold..."
3,"Great because it's Austen, but still not her best.","I enjoyed this book because I love Jane Austen's style and eloquence. It was not my favorite though. The main character was not as likeable as her other female leads. Also, I could never get past the fact that the romantic connection was between two cousins who grew up as essentially brother and sister. If you are not going to read all the Austen books, I would skip this one and read Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility instead."
4,Moderation,Unike her other novels there was no one really to hate or to love. Fanny was sort of a dull lead character so I think the other people in the story were writen in such a way as to not overshadow her. The book was well writen but did not envoke much emotion like Jane's other books.
4,Convoluted,A more complex story than the other Austen books I have read with more fully rounded characters. This is another great window into the mores of that period.
5,Great Story,Jane Austen is my favorite author. I love her work! She is a priceless gem of our great authors. All she wrote was wonderful.
2,Not happy with the print font,Dont really like the print...the font is kinda weird and the print issuper small...very hard to read...dont like it at all.
4,Mansfield Park Review,Can be very funny when read right. Quirky and interesting characters and plot points. All of Jane Austen's books are worth reading.
4,Mansfield Park,"I read this for my Jane Austen class in college and I wasn't a big fan of it at the time, but when I saw it was free for Kindle, I had to give it a second chance. Very glad I did."
3,Not bad...,"Having read Prode & Prejudice, I can't but feel that Mansfield Park was not quite upto her usual standards. The book was dragging a bit in the middle & I feel, the ending was a little hurried up. I rather thought Edmund would realise his mistake (about Miss Crawford) earlier & would propose to Fanny. The plot of the story was good & I liked the beginning too. Quite like a Cinderella tale. But I feel that she could've described the part where Edmund falls in love with Fanny in a more elaborate fashion. But all the same, a good book, but NOT for people who have read P & P, & think that this book is the same."
3,Well-written but too many words!,"Ok, Austen is a good writer, and her creation of some of the characters, especially Mrs. Norris, is superb, but I must say I found Fanny totally unrealistic and therefore unrewarding. Austen's attempts to make Fanny seem more human, for example through showing her jealousy of Mary Crawford, were too few and far between and could not dispel the strong image of her, as an unbelievable, pathetic creature, given at the beginning of the novel.The story is slow to progress and I was not satisfied with the out-come at all. Is everyone completely blind to the fact that Edmund is Fanny's cousin? I gave it such a generous mark because of the expert way Austen manipulates her words."
3,Conflicted,"I'm so upset with this book. The entire novel read much too slowly despite the fact that all these things were occuring. The author would take up an entire chapter just to say how Fanny did ONE thing, it was frustrating. Then to top it off the climax, falling point, and resolution literally all happened in the span of the last paragraph of the book as if it was a side note or something. Nonetheless, I did enjoy reading it."
1,Austen at her worst,"Mansfield Park is by far the worst book by Jane Austen. I am an avid Austen fan, and have enjoyed all of her books, except this one. I had two main complaints with this book.One, Fanny Price is the most annoying heroine. She is far too complacent. She accepts the bad treatment she recieves from her cousins and aunts with no complaints. It's as if she feels it is all she deserves! Also annoying is the fact that she is so delicate and ill all of the time. To have such a colourless creature as the central character of a book is a mistake.Second, the ending was horrible. It's as if Austen suddenly realized the book was way too long, and she had a deadline to meet. After torturing the reader for so long, she sums up Edmund and Fanny's relationship in just one chapter! If only she had edited the majority of the book, and nailed the ending better."
4,"not as crazy about it, but still good","i'm not as in love with this story as i was about Pride and Prejudice, but it's still austen and it's still an excellent read."
1,a flat boring read...,"This book was a major disapointment. I had never read a Jane Austen novel before I read this book and I thought it would be a pleasant experience. I found the book's main character to be flat, and dull, possesing none of the characteristics that make an interesting person or an interesting read. I thought the book would never end and when it did I felt like throwing a party. This novel isn't dark and complex, its just bad and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I hope to have better luck with other Jane Austen titles in the future."
4,MS-ACCESS 2003 Quick Reference Card - All Good,"MS-ACCESS 2003 Quick Reference Card - All Good! The six-page laminated card is all that it says it is... I was looking for something a little more advanced, but it is detailed and instructive in walking you through the major functions and objects... A good, basic reference. It shipped from BrainStorm, Inc. on-time and received as promised. All in all, a good transaction."
3,"Disappointed, but not bad.","This e-book was far too short to warrant the price of TEN DOLLARS. I read it all in one evening. I realized that this was the edited version, but I never thought they'd actually edit out as much as they did. It really does affect the book's story to leave out those parts. Some of the main character's thoughts and actions just don't make sense, etc,.The book is good, though. Cute, even. And if an unabridged version is released for the same price (or less would be MUCH better, considering it's an e-book that costs you next to nothing past obtaining the original copy.) then it would be much more worth it. I wish I could take it back, even as a trade-in or something, but I guess that's not how e-books work. Just rent it from the library if you're lucky enough to have that option."
3,Starts strong but falls apart,"It said that Southern brought on Hoffenberg because he couldn't figure out an ending and it really shows. It starts with classic Southern writing but falls off. Its like the movies me and my friends made in middle school when we couldn't figure out an ending and everyone died in the end. I don't want to spoil the end, but it's not great. The first half is essential for any hardcore hipster of the day."
3,Puerile and dated,"I'm sure this book was once considered shocking (shocking!), now it seems simply dated and puerile. Writen in see-the-cat English, you won't need a dictionary for this one. There is one saving grace though, I now know where the ending for the movie ""Dr. Strangelove"" comes from. It's on page 60 of ""Candy."" Dr. Strangelove said: ""Mine fuhrer ... I can WALK!"" and Candy said: ""Look, Doctor, I can ... COME!"" So it might be worth a quick read for that, but I don't recommend paying full price for it."
3,It's Okay...,"It's okay. The age recomendations are a little off. My 5 year old can turn him into the ""person,"" but can't quite get him back into the car. Overall, it's a decent toy...could use a price deduction, though. Mine fell apart too, but I was able to re-attach the arms and such since they're ball joints that are meant to be flexible."
2,Warning: Your may have a Factory Defect,"I have been browsing round the internet and have spotted many websites where people are warning others about a factory defect that will break this toy. The Automorph feature of this toy has a tab that is the wrong thickness and will break off, preventing Bumblebee from transforming back. Hasbro has been producing a second version of Bumblebee, with the tab corrected but nobody is certain when it will be in stores.Wanted to make sure people knew about this before they get mad or have to deal with a disappointed child."
5,Invasion Of The Body Snatchers [1956],"I have alot of favorite movies but,this is a Atomic Cult Classic!The book is excellent too!This film is great because it's mixed with cold war paronoia and a alien invasion.I'm probaly not the only one who thinks this film is a classic.The best part of the movie is when Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter are being chased by imposterd citizens. I'm surprised they didn't get a charliehorse.The funny part about this film is that back in 1956, people thought this could really happen. I recremend this film to people who understand about alien invasions. O yeah just remember ""You're Next""!"
5,Great old movie!,"Growing up, I remember this movie as being very scary. My granddaughter humored me and watched it with me, but after seeing the movies of today, I'm not sure she really enjoyed it. It is such a subtle plot, and not as overt as some of the movies of today. I am happy to have found it here on amazon, and I did enjoy watching it once again."
5,Very good movie!,I first saw this movie when I was maybe ten years old. It scared me and I have loved it since.
1,Pirates,"Just in case you were unsure if this was sold by movie pirates or not, look again at the tag line on the image...they even screwed that up. DO NOT BUY!"
4,Fun,"The guys in this video are hot and the photo shoots are in interesting settings. The images are stylish and tantalizing, and the look of these footballers is totally different from in the USA."
2,Hard to use,Quality of case is good but takes too long to set up and instructions are horrible. Would not purchase this item again.
4,good spacial features,"I love zoey 101, but there wasn't enough episodes on the first season. all the other shows have like 16 episodes per season, but zoey only has 13! the bonus features are awesome, but too short. there was only a few of them (and no commentary!) whats up with that?!?! over all, I give zoey 101 season1 4 out of 5 stars. :("
5,Wonderful!,"Next to ""Different Directions,"" this is his best ever recording. The best ones are the title track, ""Thanks to You"" and ""Postcard from Paris."" Great instrumentation and vocals. John was a perfectionist when it came to sound, and it showed in his work. He cared deeply about the music and the people who were listening, much different than some groups nowadays, who don't care at all about the audience and are too busy looking in the mirror. John was truly special. His passion for the earth was real too, and he didn't let his detractors get the best of him in this arena either. We miss your talents and good will."
3,Poker and Clairvoyance,"Thank you to the seller. I received the book in good condition. This book is helpful in my attempt to learn to play this game. The nextbook I will need is on Mind reading and Clairvoyance, reason being to be truly good at this game I will have to be able to read people and there minds.CharlesR"
3,Not my cuppa tea,"It's the first book I've bought on Poker and I wasn't too impressed. It was a functional depiction of odds and hand strength but I found the scenarios hard to follow and at times, contradictory."
4,Harrington on Hold'em Expert Strategy for No Limit Tournaments,"Dan Harrington's focus and strategy for No Limit Hold'em Tournaments is very insightful. It is very well constructed and provides numerous ""live"" examples of hands and detailed analysis and commentary for the advanced poker player."
5,AMAZING BOOK!,I have read this book multiple times and it has increased my poker skills in house games with my friends significantly! It lets you in on all the basics and ends with advanced strategies. Overall a great book! [...] I recommend to everyone!
3,it is worth,"I have read a lot of poker books and I have acquired a good understanding of strategy in conjuction with other texts, especially from applied mathematics and gambling psychology. This book explains in depth the strategy, reading hands and even psychology in an enjoyable manner. But I think it still has no full coverage of odds calulus, interpretation and math behind the poker. I found Catalin Barboianu's ""Texas Hold'em Odds"" far superior on this count. I recommend it as a completion for this book."
5,AMAZING......,"I have read I would say 80% of all the poker books that have been published, good and bad. Most of the books that come out are pretty much junk, slight variations on the same topics and diverts away from the topic of HOW TO WIN AT POKER. This book is at the top of my list by far.This book explains it ALL, extremely original, simply THE BEST.Harrington on Holdem Vol 1 and 2Theory of Poker by SkalanskyAnd the Tournament Holdem book by Skalansky arethe only 3 books you need."
5,Harrington book 1,"I enjoyed this book from start to finish. Great information on his style of Hold'em tournamemt play, and the play of others. I cannot wait to read Volume 2."
5,Harrington on Hold'em is the premier tournament stragey book,Harrington does a great job explaining basics and advanced plays. He has great insight into both online tournaments and live multi-day tournaments. I think the book is great.....
4,A must read for all poker players,Great book with alot of tips evne for some one who have played for years
2,"Expensive Modem, Not Worth It","Price is too high for what it offers.There's nothing extraordinary about this modem. Hardware is the same found and much more inexpensive ones.I'd say, save your money!"
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!,This product may have semi-good resistance but after using it for 15 seconds it completely cut up my hand and i got tons of blisters. Do not waste your time and money on this product.
3,Cut the crap Greenie,"My wife and I are huge fans of Golic and Greenie on ESPN.We found much of the book very entertaining, but the ""folklore"" about Aunt Ada was completely overdone.What we found particularly displeasing however, were the continual references to human excrement. Most people of adult age have raised children and took care of the nasty business of changing diapers, washing poo from the little one's bottoms, etc.I suppose bathroom humor has it place somewhere in literature when it is done well, but when it is overdone, it becomes tedious and trite.Shame on you Greenie. Try to do better next time."
1,Zzzzzzzz....,"Boring, superficial, meaningless.That about sums this snoozer of a ""book."" Another ESPN media type who thinks people actually are transfixed by his life."
5,My son LOVES this gift,"This trike is very high quality. The wheels are light weight and rubber, so there is no noise, unlike the cheap trikes with plastic wheels, which I bought the first go around. The quality of this trike is wonderful. I think it'll last until my second is old enough to ride it. I am so pleased. I bought it through Amazon because the rating was so good. I really appreciate those of you who take the time to review products. It really help those of us who are frequent online shoppers, such as myself. I had to take the time today to give this trike 5 stars."
2,Disappointing,"We received this tricycle as a gift for our two-year old, who is now 3 and a half. Even though we found it difficult to steer from the back, it was great for her at first -- she enjoyed riding as we pushed and she LOVED the basket in the back. However, once she had the coordination and the length in her legs to push, this trike proved to be a serious dud. It barely has any torque (if that's the right term); the pedals slip all over the place. She's pedaling, but she's not getting anywhere. At first we thought maybe she just needed more practice, but when we saw her on friends' trikes, it became obvious that it's this product."
4,"Good toy, but only worth $25","My toddler really likes this toy. The set doesn't come with quite enough blocks or supports, but if you have other Mega Blok sets you can add to it. It is not compatible with the other Tiny 'n Tuff racing set. The pricing on Mega Bloks sets is so inconsisent; this is not worth more than $25."
1,Dud!,"This product doesn't run. I could never get it to work, even after applying all the fixes that Microsoft had ready on its website. I'm still not sure what to do with it."
5,Atmosphere is the real deal,"This is one Atmosphere's early albums, if not their first available on CD.Atmosphere is the real deal, and I have listened to their other albums and see a progression of quality and talent, however, if one is an Atmosphere fan, one will hear the raw talent in this early venture that put Atmosphere as one of the top independent rappers.This is a very dark, somber, brooding and violent album - a tone conveyed by the album cover. However, Slug does not use these as marketing gimmicks, instead, as with all Atmosphere's music, there is a point to it. This lends a sense of urgency, purpose and energy to the album that is seen throughout.Of particular strength is Cuando Limpia el Humo, Clay and Adjust. Vocals, back-up vocals, and beats make perfect harmony that is angry and demonstrative against the world and America.This is a great, classic rap album, a must for anyone who is into rap that has a point and message, and a definite for fans of Atmosphere."
2,And?,"I received this Skip Press book for Christmas. What happened to my Amazon Wishlist???!!! No wonder Skip's writing books about writing books; my cliche meter broke after page two. It's as if the breakfast cook for the catering company that worked for the production company that helped film Saving Private Ryan piggybacked off that job to hype some product. New writers, struggling writers: there are much better books out there about writing. Don't bite on this one!"
1,Holy cow... atrocious,Needlessly complex directions? check.Directions laid out poorly on box so that you jump from step 1 to step 3? check.Stupid novelty packaging that insures one of the flaps catches on the ceiling of your microwave and topples the contents all over? check.Needlessly vertical box? check.Smell of Windex as it cooks? check.Revolting taste that resembles Thai food in no conceivable way? check
1,"I have to agree with previous ""YUKS""","I just bought 1 box at Walmart last night and was SO excited to try it today. The sauce kinda scared me, as it was gelatinous and smelled like ""fishy"" fish. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to see that it LOOKED very appetizing once it was fully cooked and poured onto a plate. That is where it ended--the food tasted absolutely dreadful. I am an avid curry fan, and have tried MANY different styles.....none resembled this one and none ever tasted so bad. I can't even describe it, but I would say a cross between cardboard and old fish with a hint of coconut and spice. I stuck with it for about 6-7 bites and had to throw it out:-(Oh well, back to WW SmartOnes for now...."
3,read it. Live it. You will live,"Reversing Hypertension: A Vital New Program to Prevent, Treat, and Reduce High Blood PressureThere are items the good Doctor did not mention.First: Never eat foods or drinks made in a factory. Consider a ""drive through window"" at a fast food joint ""death row"" Outside of oatmeal, don't eat anything from a box.look into Braggs Organic Apple Cider Vinegar. Jack LaLanne swears by it.Follow the books guide line and stick with it. This diet/exercise plan has no experation date. It's a lifestyle. Read it, believe it, live itDump all sodas and beer NOW! I bought the book last year: BP 210/120 One year later 126/74. Not bad for a 58 year old guy.Everyday, take the best possible care of yourself. The rest will take care of itself"
3,Worthwhile Canadian Initiative,"This book aroused in me an intense feeling of boredom. It's as boring as the city it's set in. Perhaps the dullest bildungsroman I've ever read. Finished it out of respect for the person who recommended it, but wow, what a slog. It would have been a much better book had she ended it when the protagonist turned ten. Seriously.Three stars for writerly craft. I hate myself for using that phrase."
2,Didn't like it,"After reading both Cat's Eye and The Handmaid's Tale, I decided that Atwood's narrative style is just not for me-she's very poetic and deep, but hers is a style that people either love or hate. I found this story to be void of any content I care about."
1,Am I missing something?,"This book drove me NUTS! I bought it because I absolutely love ""The Robber Bride,"" but this one just seemed like a big waste. I spent the whole book waiting for something interesting to happen, but the detached voice of the narrator sucks any excitement right out of the story. But all the other reviewers seem to love it, so maybe you should read it anyway and decide for yourself."
4,It's one disturbing piece of literature!,Cat's Eye brings one to a realm which most of us are familiar of--childhood. But it also introduces us to the things that Elaine wanted to bury in the deep recesses of her mind. Cat's Eye might be disturbing but it's one fine piece of work that everyone should have.
4,Peek into Pres. Packer's life.,"A wonderful biography of a very quiet and modest man. ""A Watchman on the Tower"" tells much of what went on in forming President Boyd K. Packer. His experiences in WWII, as a city counselor in Brigham City, and his extensive work with the seminaries of the LDS Church are brought to light.Lucile Tait does a remarkable job of reconstructing Boyd K. Packer's life--he keeps no journals, except for his talks. A wonderful book!"
5,Excellent and very useful resource,"This book offers a concise, logical, and very cogent approach to learning Oracle forms. It will be helpful for students and seasoned pros alike."
3,Just OK,"The instructions were missing, the seller only carries 1 of 3 colors available, and does not have online instructions available (nor do they understand themselves what all the parts are for). Save yourself some time and go buy real screws from the hardware store. The included screws are so soft as to shear under any sort of torque at all.Google enough, and you can find the back-end supplier, the instructions, and a lower shipping rate."
2,Grossly overrated,"As a fan of Alan Furst's and Philip Kerr's well-written WWII-era novels, I was enticed by Amazon reviews to buy this book. After 10 pages, I was struck by the appallingly poor quality of the author's prose style, and wondered if he would be able to maintain his average of at least one tired cliche per page, so began keeping track. 75 pages in, when I gave up counting, he was still on track.For those who are content with purely plot-driven books, are undeterred by inherent implausibilities, demand nothing beyond stock (and stick-like) characters, and are not given indigestion by sheer bad writing, this may be your cup of tea. But a 5-star book this is not."
2,This one goes right into the charity pile,"Having soldiered on and finished this book, I remain perplexed by the glowing reviews bestowed upon this book by fellow Amazonians. Where others see a classic, I see boring, two-dimensional characters. The author certainly knows the history of the period but I think he fails to bring it to life."
4,A melancholy violin,"This novel tells the story of what might have happened during the difficult days of World War II when the Allies were organizing the critical assault against the Nazis on the shores of France. The characters are interesting and the action moves along swiftly, so you do wonder what may happen and then remember what did happen as the Allied fought hard to establish a beach head and go on to defeat the Germans."
4,Good Murder Mystery! Entertaining Characters!,"This is my third murder mystery I have read by Greg Herren. He delivers a fast-paced story, interesting characters and good plot development. The characters are all hot! I love Scotty the main character and all his off-beat family. It makes for a good read. The 'almost' love scenes were continually interrupted by an event or somebody is too tired. Even when it's three people! I found this to be tiresome and repetitive part in his books. But the story line is very good and not disappointing. Looking forward to the sequel."
2,ok value for the price,"The image quality of this camera is ok, and it does support close up focusing. Software/hardware installation was no problem. It needs decent incandescent light or sunlight. I have been unable to get more than about 11 frames per second in low resolution. I think this might be due my computer having only USB 1.0. The camera says it supports USB 1.1, but I don't know if that'd make a big difference. The bundled software is very clunky and the documentation/help is scanty."
5,Most popular toy with friends,Everyone fights over this toy when they come over. It's easy to put together and looks like a real cleaning cart.
3,great toy if your handy and have a few screws,"My 21 month daughter loves this trolley. She loves pushing it around and cleaning beside me with her own supplies. Her 7 yr old sister loves to clean with it as well. The reason that I gave it 3 stars is because when they came up with the design of the cart somebody wasnt thinking. The yellow arms that come down just sits in the bottom piece and then you just sit the top piece on top of that. There are no clips or screws to hold it in place. I dont know who they thought was going to be playing with it but I know my 21 month old had it torn apart in 2 seconds, you touch it and it falls apart. My hubby took 2 screws to the top and 2 screws to the bottom and now its very sturdy and shes pushing it all over. I think for $50 they could have done a little better."
3,Cleaning Cart,"This product was enjoyed by all three of my kids. However, the cart comes apart too easily. It was separated in pieces within the first few days, and I am still looking for all the parts. With shipping, this product is $30, and I consider this too much. $20 is a reasonable price."
4,Cleaning Trolley,"My daughter loves this toy. Her favorite part is the vacuum cleaner. The only complaint is that the tray does not stay attached, but overall I would recommend this cleaning trolley."
3,Cleaning Trolley Set w/ Vacuum,"My 18 month old son loves to vacuum, so I searched for something his size. This is a fun toy that makes noise and has easy to push buttons. I wish the parts were sold separately, as the cart is a bit flimsy and not really very interesting. The dustbuster also is ok, but not as exciting as the vacuum."
1,Dollar store quality,"I have a 18 month old who wont stay away from my cleaning closet so when he got this trolley for x-mas he was so excited and immediatly started to clean. Its annoying for me as a parent though since the sticks keep coming off the broom stick and the mop, the vacuum keeps disassembling and the actual trolley itself never stayed assembled. As soon as he would go to push it somewhere it would immediatly literally crumble in his hands! I was constantly fixing the stupid thing. Maybe I can super glue the damn thing together or something.Cool concept but real dollar store quality!!!"
4,"Great idea, but needs improvement","I bought this set for my 3-yr-old sister because she really wanted it. Of course, though, all she ever plays with is the vacuum. She has every other cleaning set out there and(because of the working vacuum)this is the most expensive but the cheapest tools are included. the vacuum hose keeps coming loose from the vacuum body and just barely sucks. my mom has had to hide the vacuum and make her play with the other parts of the set. she just uses her other cleaning toys! the set has lost it's intrest so we are returning it."
2,Fire hazard!,My son loves cleaning and he got this for Christmas. Within 15 minutes of putting batteries in the vacuum it had overheated so much that the batteries started to melt! YIKES! My inlaws purchased it for him and never heard back from Amazon for a refund. What a waste!
1,Estimating boook review,"This book is out dated. There are several references to ""new technology"" that was new 17 years ago. Mispelled words and lack of color pictures make the book a low quality read. The author does make many other good points and divides the book up well."
4,I got what I paid for,"I got what I paid for. They are not a bad product for the price and they do what I need, so there is no complaints."
3,Funny show poor packaging,As far as the show goes I have no complaints the main problem with this set is the way the disk are packaged. Basically all six disk are stacked on top of each other which can make it a serious pain if you wanna watch later episodes because you have to take all the disk out put them to the side until you get the one you want put them back and then repeat the process if you want to put them away in order.
4,"Leather, not nylon","Not what I expected, but fit my Optio S5i perfect. The leather case also has a small velcro pocket for an extra battery or memory card."
3,ok movie,too expensive for this movie but i couldn't find it anywhere else. I would resell it if i wanted to its not like what i remember
4,Oh Bother...,"Huge fan of Alton Brown, but it sounds like a lot of errors in this book (I have only found the ""tk"" error in his brownie recipie). All the errors are really to bad because I think if it did not have all of the errors Alton may have gotten another nod from the James Beard Foundation. But with that said I would still recommend it to learn the science of baking.As Alton would say...""Oh Bother"""
5,Awesome...Fascinating...need I say more?,"If you not only enjoy cooking, but find the science of cooking fascinating, this book is for you. Alton writes just like he talks, which makes this book not only interesting, but fun and enjoyable. I highly recommend it!"
1,Just wrong- in a bad way,"I did not buy this movie but I have seen it and thought I'd review it. I felt I must review this movie because it needs a lower overall rating. I like crazy movies, movies that push the envelope; but this movie just made an attempt and failed on the unfunny side. It is a NASTY movie which I would be totally fine with, if it were actually funny-it's not."
1,Horrible..............................,"This is really bad. Why does Hollywood get a perfect movie and totally screw it up? The original was awesome, even got Eddie Albert an oscar nod. I'm sorry, I just don't find Ben Stiller that funny."
4,"Come on, what were you expecting??!! This is a R rated comedy... and a very fuunny one!","Ok, first off it is very coarse, and totally in line with what I could expect from the Farrelly bros. If you thought that it was a romantic comedy, than you were mistaken, and may have been disappointed. It is a comedy... a very funny one. If you are the type of neurotic person that is typified here, than you may be offended. If you are expecting wholesome family comedy, then you WILL be offended. But for anyone who became romantically involved with a closet case screwball, or knows someone that has, then you will laugh more each time you see it.It is R rated for a reason....in fact, I would say several very funny reasons. And Stiller, along with all the cast, proves that they have not only depth of character, but a sense of humor for electing to be in it.Heck, I've seen it four times, and I've found something new to laugh at each time. So many little details. That's why I'm buying it!"
3,Ben Stiller being himself,What can I say? If you enjoy Ben Stiller flicks you will probably enjoy this. Otherwise it is so-so at best.
4,Messy but funny,"Another classic style movie from Ben Stiller. You will enjoy it but some scenes may outrage you, Michelle Monahan is lovely and the Mariachi is really annoying in a funny sense."
4,Great Comedy,"If you like comedies, you'll love this movie, to me it was non-stop laughs. People should realize that comedy movies are meant to make us laugh and feel good (and they do not necessarily need to be taken seriously) and this movie does just that."
1,1 hr 56 minutes and $7.50 I will never get back,"I love Ben Stiller, I think he's very funny. I expected some potty humor, I expected some uncomfortable (for me) jokes about sex. I thought it would be something like ""So I Married An Axe Murderer"", I had no idea this would be as cringe inducing as Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights. It is all of the body functions of 8 Crazy Nights and the discomfort of the Ben Stiller's stupid charter's actions from Meet the Parents, without the humor of the latter. The trailer is much funnier and charming than the movie."
1,Ridiculous..and Not in a Good Way,"This movie has some potential, but is ultimately just one dirty (but not funny) joke after another. I found myself checking the time frequently in the hopes it would soon would be over."
2,Save your Money,Not everything with Ben Stiller in it is going to be good. Even Jerry Stiller is bad in this movie. The whole movie is in bad taste and I wouldn't waste my time. I only rented it because it was filmed in SF where I used to live. Other than that...don't bother.
4,"Its Rated R people, not PG or PG13","I think a lot of people forgot to look at the rating. Its rated R not for some potty mouth but some nudity and some raunch. I was not expecting much, much like I expect from any movie out these days, but was pleasantly surprised. There are a few moments that I was in stiches, and some others that fell flat. Carlos Mencia I thought was so dumb in this he actually cracked me up, I think that was the point ""Ah screw off, I am joking"". Akerman is good in this, Stiller is pretty funny at times, but it was Monaghan that I really enjoyed in this. Picture a brunette Mary Swanson (Cameron Diaz), but cuter and funnier. Her and her family kind of made this movie for me.Overall, I enjoyed it, not the best movie but not nearly as bad as many are making it out to be. 3.5 stars"
2,Very disappointed,"It's sad to see that the Farrelly Brothers haven't been able to recover their greatness. This movie could have and should have been better. Dumb and Dumber, Theres something about Mary, Kingpin and Outside Providence all came out more than 8 years ago. Hopefully they'll get back on track with some good low brow very un-pc comedy (The Ringer spent more time getting ""approval"" than making laughs)."
1,One of the WORST Movies I've Ever Seen,"Since Amazon doesn't have a zero star rating, I can only give it one star. PLEASE don't waste your money and time on this horrible remake. You can still find copies of the 1972 original starring Charles Grodin and Jeannie Berlin -- a very different movie that's intelligently written and acted with a completely different storyline. This new version belongs in the toilet."
2,See The Original,"Don't waste your time on this course remake. Do see the '72 original withCharles Grodin, Cybill Shepherd and the very funny Jeanne Berlin (daughterof Elaine May!) The two stars are for the wonderful location cinematography."
2,"Ok gameplay, but got boring","I'm not particularly a fan of the Godzilla films. I did watch the 1998 Godzilla movie and enjoyed it. I was expecting some similarities in this game, but I couldn't find any.I played story mode as I thought it'd be a good opportunity to learn the controls. Getting started, it was difficult to figure out what the objectives were (asides from smashing the other monster). After a couple hours struggling to get Godzilla to execute the moves, I simply gave up. It was unresponsive, as many other reviewers have indicated.I believe the best aspect of the game is the multiplayer brawl that you can play. The brawl-mode reminded me of Wii Sports-Boxing.This game just didn't cut it for me, and will likely end up as a gift to my cousins."
1,Not Worth the Money! Save yours or donate to charity.,"Mr. Wayne House, ignorantly includes the United Pentecostal Church as a cult. Having a doctorate degree he is what the bible defines as 7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 2 Tim 3:7 KJV"
1,Bad reaction,"Have used this on my two labs. One (90lb) is okay with it, the other (60lb) paces around and pants and seems to be very upset and acts strangely for the rest of the day. I am not going to use it anymore...even on my other dog."
5,Advantix does it again,This product is simply wonderful. Not only does it keep off the normally crawlies it keeps mosquitoes off too which is great because we live in heartworm country. It is a great added measure for protection.
5,GOOD STUFF!!!,"Have been using this product since I got my two bulldogs and it works great. My dogs are mainly inside dogs, but my dogs like to play outside. Good Stuff! Have never had a problem."
3,fleas and ticks in Ky,The product works well on both fleas and ticks. Any ticks on the dogs fall off. The only problem that we can see is that the fleas and ticks are so bad again this year in our area that the product doesn't last all month. Seems like after about 2 1/2 weeks it isn't working as well. I will check with my vet to see if it can be applied more than once a month and not danger the dogs.....
3,6 MONTH K9 ADVANTIX Red (for dogs 21-55lbs),I use this product on my Spaniel monthly and she still got Lyme.... Go figure.
1,Ticks love this stuff like a perfume saying drink my blood!,I got K9 advantix for my old dog maybe 7 years ago and put it on him about 4 days before a trip to a lake in Kansas. We camped for several days and that last day there I noticed he had ticks and found several more by the time I got back to Denver. I noticed the product was made in Kansas so I mailed a letter voicing how ticked off I was that their product didn't work plus the fact the ticks were Kansas ticks and one would think their stuff should work on their own ticks. BTW did I forget to mention the live ticks I pulled off were included with my letter! LOL! PS My dog did develop chronic kidney failure and I wonder if this !@## had something to do with it?
5,good tick/flea preventative.,My dogs have used this for years & have never had fleas. They do sporadically get ticks on them but I have them in the woods about every day.
4,Effects of K9 Advantix,Product causes reaction of shaking of head and ears (mini-doxi) as if something is in the dog's ears. Effect persists for about a week.Product was received as advertised in a timely manner.
1,Ended up not using this,"We bought this before talking to our vet, the side effects just weren't worth it. Moral of the story is talk to your vet before you buy anything like this."
5,No Fleas or ticks EVER with Advantage or Adavantix,"We've used Advantage for ten years and then switched to Avantix a few years ago and we have NEVER had a flea or tick on ANY of our dogs, in our house or in our yard EVER. Not one time. Nor have we had any ill effects with any of our dogs, young or elderly. We have moved several times to new locations and had countless rescue dogs from shelters and off the streets move into our home before being placed with their own forever families. Every one of those dogs came in with fleas and we treated them with the Advantage product or Advantix and they were flea free in days and none of our animals were infected. Nothing else works as fast or as well. Don't waste your money or your time or your pet's well being & comfort with the off brand cheaper knock offs, you'll just end up buying the real deal Advantage in the long run anyway."
1,Beware of the risks!,"Within 2 hrs of applying this product to my 2 year old 19 lb healthy dog, he began shaking, crying and scratching out-of-control. After 3 days, 2 baths, 2 trips to the Vet and one steriod injection by the Vet, his skin is still red and appears to have a chemical burn on the site of application. He still has sudden bursts of pain causing him to cry, shake and pant heavily. The manufacturer was contacted by the Vet and while they are aware of this type of adverse reaction, they provided little information for treatment or duration.If you choose to use this product, watch your dog carefully and be ready to act quickly if you notice any discomfort."
1,DO NOT USE!,"Almost took my Husky to the vet after using this product.Within an hour of giving this to my dog he was acting very strange. He was almost paralyzed in his hindquarters, he couldn't walk more than a few feet without hitting the ground and then would frantically start biting at his rear end. He wouldn't come to me when I called him and would just go lay down with a scared look on his face. I felt so bad for him and felt even more upset with myself for not reading more into it. I will NEVER use this product again.Read other reviews, it's not bogus. This product has very adverse side effects for some animals and I would recommend avoiding it all together if you care about your pet. It's simply not worth the risk."
4,Very Good,Excellent book. I had a little difficulty following the characters at first but I couldn't put the book down. Unlike a lot of todays authors he doesn't take sides but presents life in the raw.
1,Doesn't offer anything new,"She is getting notorious to becoming famous, selling her body for popularity. Yuck. I don't even finish watching her video clip ""Heads Will Roll"", I want to puke halfway throughThe first album is really great, nearly all the song in it I love (bar the weird At The End Of The Day). But this Extended Play is a total failure, I don't like when she just co-write all the new songs, she have a history of making good song by herself, back from M2M days. Probably too busy promoting herself or something. Most of the song in the EP have catchy tune (Good 4 Sex, new Heads Will Roll) but you'll forget it in a matter of daysMy top tip? AVOID, its a waste of your money. Unless you like to see bunch of naked girl lying and a nasty song"
3,Rebel Rousers,"Rebel Rousers is one of the many so-called ""Outlaw"" biker movies from the late sixties and early seventies. Interesting only, because it shows a young Jack Nickolson, who started his carriere in bikermovies, for which he does not want te be remembered! What can I say? It is amusing, but you forget it after watching!"
4,Chemistry - McMurry and Fay,"I have bought this book many times for my students ... this is a very good book on this topic for Grade 12 students. It covers the topics very well. It is well illustrated ... easy to follow ... concepts are simply explained, properly covering the depth knowledge required for that level.One the best textbooks on the market for this subject."
2,Quit working after less than a year,"It will not read new disks out of the package, old disks, it will not read any disk for that matter, and it had barely been used! we bought it to use in our smaller car, it does not have a DVD unit in it like our SUV. We have NEVER used it in the car. I used it on my kitchen table the day i bought it, to test it, watched an entire movie on it while fixing dinner.I have hooked it up to a TV in the guest bedroom to watch a movie when my children have friends over and i want to watch a movie in quiet. After owning it less than a year, watching LESS than 10 movies, it will not read disks anymore.I have cleaned it with a cleaner, to no avail. I believe from watching the unit that the eye has stopped moving along the disk to read as it should.So this was a complete waste of money. DO NOT BUY THIS ONE, spend a little more and get a Sony! in all the years i have been buying electronics i have never had issue with theirs!"
2,Dead Battery,"Eventually the battery died. It will not hold a charge, and it is therefore useless on a place with no outlet. I would not purchase this again"
3,good but limited,The ds3000 works well but is limited! The sound is great when dolby is present but don't move your head too much or you will loose sound and under some situations will become scratchy. All in all I like them because it does the job for me. When my wife is working in the kitchen in our small house in Arizona I miss some of the words. Don't be afraid to buy this product!
2,Expensive poor performer,"I had hoped wireless technology got better in the last few years and I have been proved wrong.The digital surround sounds fake as it did 10 years ago on the early digital wirless sets, the hiss is noticeable to the point of rendering unpleasant the listening experience, and the set is uncomfortable to wear.Good point for expandability, as it can serve additional headsets, making possible a listening experience shared among multiple people."
2,Hiss Ruins a Comfortable Experience,"With a one year old finally sleeping through the night I felt it time to pick up some wireless surround sound headphones so I could catch up on films in the evening. I made the mistake of choosing price over quality and do I regret it. While these headphones get some great reviews, my experience sides with those less than impressed.I can't connect the headphone receiver to my amp since there is no output on it, so I was left connecting it directly to my PS3's optical output. No matter the position of the headphone receiver (behind the tv, in front of it, pointed directly towards me, etc.) I can't get the terrible hiss to go away. Yes, you can turn up the volume but only during loud action sequences is the hiss finally masked. But as soon as anything quiets down even remotely the his is noticeable.I have since returned these headphones and ordered a more expensive but better reviewed set. Hopefully my experience with that pair will turn out better."
5,also known as...SPC part #67090,"Although I ordered ACDelco part #45K0159 (for my 2001 Acura 3.2CL Type-S), I received an equally efficient replacement part...the SPC adjustable (rear upper) control arm assembly (part #67090). The SPC brand item is identical in appearance to what is shown in the picture for the ACDelco 45K0159 and I could not be more pleased. In comparison, the SPC brand item is $30 more expensive per control arm, so I saved myself $60 on the pair by purchasing the ACDelco brand! This is defintely a quality item!"
5,Superior to the larger version which was a bloated mess.,"I am so glad I bought this years ago and held onto for all this time. I have owned the larger version of this book and think that this one is much better.The larger version simply is full of useless pages of not so usefull charts and diagrams and just useless graphics. This version is the one you would actually use. I find it's tallish size and two column pages promote it's being a handbook and not a textbook. You end up spending just enough time in it as necessary for a handbook.There are plenty of USEFULL charts, high quality pen and ink drawings, and maps on 95%+ of the pages which breaks things up nicely, visually.The book seems to provide just the right amount of intellectual relief from the biblical text..similar to casually discussing things you've read with a friend, as reinforcement for understanding.Though old, it's actually better tham most recent bible 'handbooks' available and worth picking up as a used book."
2,Try It Before You Buy It!,"For someone who spends so much time meditating -- and writing about that experience -- Goldberg is the most neurotic nonfiction writer I've ever tried to read. I'll definitely give her earlier books a read, but there was really nothing new or unique in this work that I could really use. Her ""voice"" was so irritating that I just had to put it down a third of the way though."
4,Trayola Washable Markers,The product is as was expected. The only negative is I feel there should have been more colors instead of the same 12 colors multipled by 4. That was the only disappointment.
5,Works Great!,"I purchased this modem because it is controller based and it is not a WinModem. This means it works more efficiently with computers because it doesn't tax system resources. In addition, I'll be able to use this with Linux.Installation went off without a hitch. I installed the drivers for Windows 98, rebooted, Windows recognized the modem and now I'm up and running.Much easier than opening the case and installing a PCI card.I'm connecting at 48k currently.The new v.44 compression is excellent. I notice a significant difference in the downloading of web pages.It's great. Looked at US Robotics & Creative. This seemed like the right one for me.Enjoy!"
4,Quick inflation and comfortable,"I've owned inflatable beds before and I find this one exceptional above the others. The bed inflates quickly as advertised; the airpump is a little noisy (but who cares for only a few minutes). Once inflated, the bed is actually comfortable for an air mattress in that it holds it shape; I don't feel like a bowling ball on a raft like I do on other air mattresses. I add a little air every couple of days.The only negative is kitty walked across the bed and punctured the mattress; the repair kit did not fix the hole like I would have liked. I purchased two, so I am careful to not let kitty jump on the second bed."
2,Inferior Product!,"I don't recommend this air bed, I am disappointed in the performance of this mattress! The air seeps out, my guest is a petite person so I don't understand why the air mattress would lose air so fast. Then the unthinkable happened while my guest was sleeping on it, the center section of the mattress got a huge bubble and it become uncomfortable to sleep on; hence my guest slept in a sleeping bag on the floor for the remainder of their stay. This was not what I expected nor wanted to happen. Think twice about purchasing this Air Bed, it is an inferior product. Yes, the price is affordable but like the saying goes, ""You get what you pay for!"""
3,Instructions needed,"Product works great, although it needs instruction guide specially for people not familiar with the product."
2,"Good book, stupid layout","This book has a lot of good info and photos. But the layout is the stupidest thing I've seen in a book. Most of the photos are spread across two pages and since this book is quite thick, the centers of the pictures are curved and it ruins the photos. The info and the photos in the book should get 5 stars but the layout has ruined everything. They have also missed IL 2 which I believe is the most produced aircraft in history if not in the second world war. They have included aircraft models that are much insignificant but missed IL 2. Some would argue that IL 2 was a ground attack aircraft but not a fighter but almost half of this book is dedicated to bombers and other non fighting aircraft. I give 2 stars because it makes me mad to see all the good photographs in this book spread across two pages which looks like the author is mocking me."
5,One of the most facinating & exciting history narratives,A truly fabulous book. I strongly recommend it.
4,Tales of the Guilded Age,"At first glance this seems to be sort of a regional bit of history. Our main protagonist, Henry Flagler, turns out to be a peer of Rockefeller who embarked on an almost pyramid-building type of project to bridge the Florida Keys. Although mostly a curiosity, author Les Standiford uses this project to bring the Guilded Age of American business to life. He manages to convey the peril and monumentous task that Flagler spearheaded with his ocean railroad, and the writing is taut and to the point. In fact, my one complaint is that there are glimpses of other topics that Standiford only mentions in passing, but could have also made for compelling reading and a wider canvas. But what is in the book is very informative and interesting."
4,Nice Little Historical Vignette,"This is a fascinating short history of the remarkable railroad built connecting the Florida mainland to Key West in the golden age of Hemingway. Written with verve and humor, the story of protagonist Henry Flagler appeals to that unique American optimism and joie de vivre so emblematic of the early twentieth century. That this optimism ran smack into the awesome terrors of mother nature only provides the antagonist to this little historical tale. Highly recommended for a winter weekend in the snowbound Rocky Mountains, where I write this review."
3,"5 stars for CCR, 2 1/2 stars for this album with edited versions of songs.","CCR music is great, I own the first 6 albums on CD. This compilation has great songs, yes, but some of the songs have been edited, so you're not getting the whole song as the artists intended. Kinda like cutting a section off Van Gogh's The Starry Night painting because a businessman decided the public didn't want to see too many stars."
5,Heavy Base Rock,"This CD is extremely good. CCR is classic rock with a very heavy base, catchy beats, and an obvious Southern blues influence that can even be detected in the pronounciation of the lead singers. Music like this remains classic throughout the ages..."
5,One of the greatest c.d.'s ever!,"This c.d. captures the great sounds that is distinctively Creedence. Their version of ""I heard it through the grapevine"" is by far the best I have ever heard. Great song selections make this a c.d. you will never get tired of!"
3,Disappointed,"Most of the songs here are excellent and it's great to hear them again.But, one of CCR's best tracks is their unique rendition of Suzie Q and on this album there is only a shortened version of it which is a real let-down. It should be made clear before buying an album whether the tracks featured are full-length - maybe Amazon could include track timings along with the listings."
5,Perhaps the Greatest Collection of All Time,"As a teenager, many people that grew up with CCR might think that I can't truly appreciate this music and the impact it's had. Quite to the contrary, however, all one from any generation needs to do is listen to this collection, once, and they will know that CCR is one of the greatest bands of all time."
5,We got it!!!,"Totally awesome, great condition, and couldn't be happier!! Never thought it could be so easy and cost so little. What a deal!!!"
5,the raw power of CCR.,"if i had one disc to my collection that i'd play alot, this would be it. second to my beatle collection a collection of all their hits here on this cd ready to knock your sock off & get you to dance. get ready to experince the raw beautify power of this of band, also get vol 2 it's a winner also."
5,"Iconic, Gritty, gotta dance, Genisis music and lyrics","CCR.... If these guys were at their prime in your teenage years, or your 20's you had your own coolest of the cool music to love. Thank God for the ablility to record sound. CCR/ John Fogerty are quit simply the definition of a very cool period in time that defined the memories of a generation of those of us fortunate enough to have been there, and then they went on to affect more generations with their undeniably disticntive sound. Every CCR song has a memory of what I was doing at that time in my life. I'm too old to do them justice on the dance floor anymore, but my heart and soul dances the same as it did when I was 20 years old when I hear one of their songs. CCR's music and Fogerty's voice cannot be seperated from my awesome memories of my youthful years and all those great times. Share it with your grandkids, this music deserves to live forever."
5,Great for exercise dancing,"These tunes bring back lots of good memories and I am using them to get me up and moving more, too."
5,great CD,I play this a lot. Love to hear those old hits and was surprised to hear them do I Heard On the Grapvine.
1,Not pleased,"The quality of the print is OK, but this company shipped the wrong size poster -- not once (OK, mistakes happen) but twice. Let's see if they can get it right the third time!"
2,Focus on the 'Sourcebook',"The title is ""The Official Patient's Sourcebook on Orthostatic Hypotension"". Perhaps I was naive, but I expected detailed information on Orthostatic Hypotension. Instead, this book teaches you how to research this topic on the internet, etc."
2,Not the best movie,I would say this was a mediocre made for TV movie. Not sure it was made for TV it could have been. If you're bored and this is the only thing on it might be worth watching
3,Replacement nets,"What can I say, A net is a net. Did save money though which is important and it arrived quickly"
5,Inspector Lewis Series,I love this series just like I loved Inspector Morse. Sergeant Hathaway is a great addition to the cast of characters. I can't wait to see the later seasons.
4,Oregon Does it Again...,"Eugene, Portland, Salem; these cities bring us some awesome bands, and the Rock n Roll Soldiers are no different. First hearing the two E.P.s on Gearhead Records, and then the collection on Atlantic, the boys have really grown on me. They are fighting the fight, and winning the battle of Rock N Roll. I am still taken back with ""Lay Down and Die"" and I can't believe it isn't in an A: Commericial (I predict Beer or Cars), B: TV Show or C: Constant Rotation as a video on TV.This band is going to blow up in the next 6 months."
4,Please read this book...,"Without going into the actual storyline too deeply, I will only say that this book is beautiful and sad and I think accurately portrays the conflicting feelings of people who love and resent their family members. The main character in the book is Vera, who has left her father and disabled brother in Saskatchewan to forge a new life for herself in Toronto and ends up returning feeling not quite defeated but definitely weathered. Her relationships with her son and her aging father are complicated and recognizable and the ending was surprising as the past comes back at first to hurt and then to heal. I grew up in Saskatchewan and many familiar characters of the small town are present in the story...it is worth reading if for no other reason than to visit the prairie landscape, but the characters will pull you in as well."
4,Great Music Stuck Inside Seriously Bad Packaging,"Paul is still going strong. The music is great, as I am sure many will attest to.But I have to say this ""deluxe limited edition"" is the worst packaging of any music CD I have seen. It is the size of a DVD, which is inconvenient. But the disc holders don't let go of the CD's. You have to struggle with it just to get them out with out damage. The unfolding pictures are nice. I guess its the only way to get a few pictures of Paul in there.Overall, very happy with the music. Very unhappy with the packaging."
2,Paul let me down on this one.,I got the deluxe set. I have only listened to the first disc once. I really only like one song on this whole disc. Paul and the group are just not as good this time around. Very disapointed.
1,Least favorite McCartney album,"I've been a McCartney fan all my life. I am a musician myself and loved his Caos and Creation album. In fact, I worked out many of the tunes and play and sing them regularly. I thought Memory Almost Full was terrible. The only cut I sort of liked was the second one. I ended up taking it back to where I bought it because I knew I wouldn't have any interest to listen to it again. However, I remain a huge McCartney fan."
2,McCartney ho hum,"I was a big Beatle fan back in the 60s. I've several McCartney solo albums. While this is a pretty good album, I didn't find myself humming anything which is really unusual when I like music. If you're a die-hard McCartney fan, buy this. If not, it's okay."
5,THE QUALITY NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE!,"To each his own, but how anyone could dish this CD is inexcusable. I dare ANYONE to do 20 solo albums and come within 12,000 miles of this kind of quality! Four tracks, ""Dance Tonight,"" ""Mr. Bellamy,"" ""House Of Wax,"" and ""The End Of The End"" are so over the top quality-wise, he could belch and fart the rest of the songs and still have a CD that eclipses 98% of what's out there right now in pop music. Not to worry, though. The remaining nine cuts range anywhere from and ""8"" to a ""9."" Actually, if the best cuts from ""Chaos"" and ""Memory"" were combined, Macca would have one of the top five CDs of all time . . . and still, people would be dissing on it. Such is the arrogance of the tone-deaf and ignorant! By all means, buy this one, play it again and again, and savor each new sound you hear every time you play it. After all, you never know when the end of the end is going to be."
1,"My First ""McCartney"" Disappointment. . .","Like the gal wrote in an earlier review. . .""I'm surprised at all the good reviews!"".Like most all of Paul's CD's. . .I've either preordered, or purchased without any sampling. When this came in the mail, both my wife and I were severely disappointed. Paul's voice was sounding whiney and strained. . .and. . . with exception of a couple of tunes, the writing wasn't all that good. We feel that Paul's talent has finally succumbed to his ego. His work smacks of a man who feels that everything he does is genius. If all this wasn't bad enough. . .I find that the two entire CD's can be loaded on one standard CD-R. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Paul believes that his fans want to hear 20 minutes while he dribbles on about how he came to write the songs. . .Great marketing ploy here. . .little else. Sorry Paul."
2,Disappointed,"Lifelong Macca fan. I'd been anticpating this album and was very disappointed. Listened once. I can't imagine putting it back in unless I use the track filter on my player. There are a few songs that I love, a few that were decent, and about half were absolutely unlistenable. Topping it off with ""Nod Your Head"". Yikes. Where is the maturity? This is a grown man. His attempts to recapture an angry youth definitely did not succeed. And, honestly, is that what the fans want? Certainly not this one. The lyrics and tunes are shallow and forced. I love you Paul, but not this album. I'll be putting it away as a keepsake. Back to Chaos!"
5,Best of the batch,"This first of the Sharpe's series is the best of the batch. Most of the books are at least 4 star quality, however this one is SO much better than the batch it is almost a shame to read it at the begining. (Start with the india series, so you can work your way here.)Lt. Richard Sharpe and his riflemen join an foray into Spain to destroy a bridge, he runs afoul of Sir Henry Simmerson (In the movies he is played to the hilt and makes a supurb foe, See sharp movie # 2, #8 & #9)The battle for the endangered colors is gripping, Sharpe is rough, blunt and just likable. Harper is great fun and the battle scenes are awesome.This is the start of something wonderful, however it will never be as wonderful as this on. Thank you B. Cornwell"
5,Lema - A great western heroine,"If you read Buck Moline, you have to read Lema, which is a continuation of the great storyline started with Buck Moline. For all the tomboys out there that had childhood dreams of living during that era, Lema is the perfect role model.Layman has scored a hit again!"
5,Gift for Daughter's Pre-K Class,I bought this for my child's teacher for teacher appreciation week. She really loved them because they were just right for small hands and the children enjoy playing with them.
1,Dont waste your money,"We were very disappointed with this toy. It looked like it would be a lot of fun for our 4year old. However when we recieved it, and tried it, we realized that the magnets wre very weak, and you can hardly buid it higher than two stories, and then everything crashes down. We are sending it back."
3,Not TV Friendly,"My kids teeter between enjoying these and being frustrated. My 2 year old makes ice cream cones and telephones out of them for us to share, but my almost 4 year old gets very frustrated because he will be in the middle of building something and one little shift and the whole thing falls down. Also, my 2 YO took one of them to the TV screen. I had no idea that it would mess with the picture on the screen. I guess I wasn't thinking. Luckily it went away, but I caught him just as he had begun making pretty colors on the screen. Plus keep them away from computers. The magnets are pretty strong."
1,Quite a disapointment,Have purchased the same version in the smaller magnets for my grandkids and they worked great. This is one time that bigger is not better. They are two heavy to build up high. The magnets are not strong enough to hold them up. They work great if you just attach one to another on the floor. If you try to build up with them they are just two heavy and keep falling. This is one of those times that you should stick to the smaller sticks these so not cut it. They were quite a disappointment.
1,difficult and potentially dangerous,"My grandchildren (ages 3 and 5) found this toy to be of zero interest. Construction difficult enough that the adults couldn't do anything fun with it either. More serious is that the balls are quite heavy -- heavy enough that, when heaved by a 3 year old, they made a dent in the wall board. Perhaps there is an age group for which this is a safe and enjoyable toy, but I would not recommend it for households where there is a child young enough to consider throwing the balls."
5,Loved this book!,"I loved this book! It is well written and held my attention. Based on historical facts, it seemed very plausible. I was sorry to get to the end."
3,"Great production numbers, so so story","Made shortly after Ziegfeld's death, this is a movie with spectacular musical numbers. The fact that, naturally, none of it is done with CGI just makes you appreciate it more. The story, however, is a rather flat, lackluster telling of one of the more exciting figures of the Gilded Age. However, you do get to see William Powell and Myrna Loy together, so that's always good."
3,Too Bad Busby Berkley Was Not the Director,"Fairly boring big budget MGM biopic............Powell as always is great, and seeing Fanny Brice was very interesting............the musical numbers needed better direction, and the story really dragged. Hard to believe this won best picture when so many other great films were made that year."
1,Christy Lane's Square Dancing Today,"I agree with the previous review, this was very disappointing. I expected Country Ho-Down music but this is modern disco music. You can't use this to Barn Dance! Save your money."
5,My Granddaughter was thrilled,My 7 year-old granddaughter opened this at Christmas and was thrilled. She could not wait to start with it. She asked if she could open it and start painting as soon as she got home. I just love these type of presents. You have something to cherish instead of a dust collected toy that the child has grown bored with.
4,The wife loved it,The picture does not do the size of this bird house justice. When the box came I assumed that there were multiple items in the box. Joke on me. This bird house can hold alot of bird seed and my wife loves it.
1,Broken upon arrival/ was a Christmas gift,"I just recently found out the the bird feeder I purchased for a friend's Christman, along with the bird food was damaged. I was very disappointed."
1,Very fragile - it broke the first month,I was really excited about the feeder. I filled it and raised it up andthe birds came but then it broke. I tried to tape it up and it lookedterrible and broke again. So here I am buying a different feeder.
2,came with a cracked frame,"I received this bird house with a 4"" crack along the base. It was inexpensive, so I won't even go through the hassle of returning it. For the price, I guess that plastic is understandable..."
1,Cherry Valley gazebo bird feeder,"I just received two of the Cherry Valley gazebo bird feeders, I bought them because of their large size.I filled one and when I hung it up the hanging support broke, the feeder crashed to the ground and the bottom cracked and the seed came out when I lifted it up.This feeder is a total piece of crap.Don't waste your money."
2,Customer,I thought this looked like such a neat bird feeder I had to get it for my Grandpa. Shipping was great and it arrived super fast. When I took it out of the package I was like this is so cool looking. But upon closer examination it is very very very cheaply made. Thin plastic and the paint was not inside the lines. I am super disapointed. This would have been soooo cool if they had put a little more into it. Not worth the price.
3,Non-inspiring Quotes,"Surely these quotes aren't the best things people said. Many are so demeaning to women and take the base, low-road. I wanted something helpful and uplifting and did not get it. Dear Abby really liked this book?"
3,Pears soap is not as good...,"I used to love Pears soap as I kid. I would see it around the house a lot, and seeing it brought back memories. When I bought some pears In the store and brought it home, I was shocked. It smells of something like Insect Repellent. I can still smell something like the Original Pears, but this is just a Partially Butchered Version. A little bit disappointed..."
5,Visually rich graphics and enchanting story.,"This book captured the eye of my 3-year old and his daycare friends as soon as it was opened for the first time. The colors are full and rich, with emphasis on orange and black contrasts and there's even a vivid rainbow at the end. The story is easy to follow and your child can create his/or her own sounds for the four Kivas described within (Kiva of Lions, Serpents, Bees and Lighting!). One of George McDermott's best; highly recommended."
4,No Deception Here,"When I saw the first review that was posted, I thought a little correction was in order. This is a reprint of a book that first appeared before Stephen King had even begun to publish. The title has nothing to do with Stephen King and there is no reason anyone should think it does. This is, in fact, one of the most innovative novels of its time, and we are lucky to have it back in print. In you are at all interested in complex narratives about musicians, this is the novel for you. Heck, I bet even Stephen King would enjoy this book. William Melvin Kelley is among the most important African-American novelists of the post-World War II era, and this book ranks among his finest."
5,"Well researched, very well written","This book is well researched, very well written and an interesting read. As seems typical with historical books of this nature, coverage of the more recent events seems comparatively superficial as their full influence is yet to be determined."
2,"Well written, but shallow and biased","Gordon is a fine writer and An Empire of Wealth is a not too demanding read. But it is also not too demanding in another way. Although interesting in parts and sweeping in scope, the book is basically a 419 page (I have the paperback) puff piece. Most red-blooded Americans will find Gordon's boosterism infectious (I did), but what is significant about the book is what it doesn't say and what Gordon chooses to leave out of history.Acoording to Gordon, all of the U.S.'s wealth was (1) essentially built by great men, (2) come by honestly (or through charmingly ingenious roguery), (3) a matter of simple addition, with little downside. Anyone even slightly familiar with the history of the industrial revolution, the westward expansion, the struggles of trade unions, Government corruption and favoritism, or monopoly practice will need to check their intellects at the door. This is history as big business cheerleading."
4,An Empire of Wealth: John Gordon Steele,"John Gordon Steele's an Empire of Wealth is a very good book about the history of capitalism in this country and the vital link between America's greatness as a nation and the free-market capitalism it has always practiced. Steele's book is a good antidote to the constant stream of anti-capitalist thinking permeating today's Washington politics, especially that represented by the current bombast from the political left. He testifies to the importance of free markets in both ensuring economic growth and personal liberty, a truth which our Founding Fathers and later-day economists such as Milton Friedman readily grasped. A very good read for those who still admire and love this country (and want to be reminded why we all should)."
5,One of my Favorite authors,"One of my favorite books I read was ""The Great Game"" by John Steele Gordonwhich is the reason why I bought this book, it was very informative but it got me upset a lot for some reason that I haven't been able to identify yetI had to quit reading it with 75 pages leftIt would be a great book if I were a Capitalist which I am not, I think I got really angry because I was reading about how Capitalism really is I did learn a lot about my country though which is more saddening than anything though1. money-stock market and corporations2. beauty-Hollywood and whores"
1,Horrible,"This movie was awful. The acting was mediocre and there was essentially no plot. It didn't give any real insights into the lives of the rich or the conflict between rich and poor. It did not even work as a believable ""coming of age"" story. The director threw in some some gratuitous drug use and violence, but that was hardly enough to keep my interest. I was glad when the credits started rolling on this one."
1,Aearo clear lens safety glasses,"I found and purchased these safety glasses based on the performance of a pair purchased 15 years ago---yes they lasted that long till the temple broke. However, these new glasses have a very poor quality lens, they scratch at the slightest use during a construction project. These are not the glasses I expected. Most disappointed."
5,No more pumps,It may be a little more expensive but well worth it. It doesn't go flat so you don't need to pump it or find a pump to pump it.
2,Went Flat in Three Months,"This ball went flat within three months. It developed a leak in its side. It was used only for casual outdoor play on asphalt in warm weather. It did not live up to its ""never flat"" promise. It was a good ball while it lasted - but that is the problem: it did not last! I would not pay a premium price for this ball again."
1,Is this ball for real?,"C'mon, this is a total waste of my money...this ball is for children for cryin'out loud!!! If you look closely to the picture you would think it is almost a pro basketball, instead what you get is a child's ball that you notice immediately after you touch it...What a shame!"
