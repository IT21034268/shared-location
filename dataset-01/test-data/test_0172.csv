3,A disappointment.,I loved Alice's first 2 major releases so I really wanted to like this cd. Unfortunately it seems that they ran out of inspiration.
5,Nice hoops,"Very nice, thinner style hoops. The silver is good and shiny. I like the thinner style which is why I ordered these. Looks more classy I think."
3,Obcession is genderless,"Been there, done that, have the t-shirts. Though I am male, I went through many of the same obcessions with distance running and with the women around me who were in the same sport. I think this is a cautionary tale for all athletes...true more so for women...to get a balanced life, because sports identity is fragile and fleeting.The male coach/femal athlete issue deserves more attension."
2,Shallow,"I bought this for my masters thesis on La Primavera. I am very disappointed in Zollner's shallow analysis of the painting. This painting was more than likely NOT ment to be a wedding painting, and does not take into account the very complex interests of the intellectual circle that surrounded Botticelli and his patrons, the Medicis. I did find this book helpful for understanding some of the symbolic meanings of some of the objects and to compile the historiography section of my thesis. However, if you are looking for a real understanding of the painting, this book won't give it to you."
5,Excelent,"Product is wonderful, my boyfriend lost all of his in his last move, so these were his Christmas present. Got to me in plenty of time and was as described."
1,A man's fork but great for women too,"My husband loves his Knork. After all, who hasn't tried to cut food with the side of their fork? The Knork is more than a great utensil, it is a fine tool."
2,Okay,"This installation is weaker than the previous two in the series (The Proposal and The Rescue). It's a quick read and quickly forgotten. The premise is interesting, the main character reading to a blind man, but I found Cassandra's ""modesty"" about her looks annoyingly superficial and self-centred. The dialogue sounds odd and too modern and the story cuts back and forth way too much between the different characters to find out what they are doing and thinking at that precise moment. (Usually they are talking about the other characters or involved in something totally inconsequential to the plot). This book reminds me of white bread. Filling, light and maybe even temporarily satisfying with very little nutritional content. This series is okay, but I would recommend The Brides of Culdee Creek by Kathleen Morgan over the English Garden series."
3,Disappointed,"I received this pendant as a Christmas gift. While the front of the pendant is beautiful, the back has a rough finish. There was also a black smudge on the back of the pendant that cannot be removed. The company said they would send a new one w/envelope to return the defective pendant. I have not seen it. For the money, it should have been perfect. Since no one will see the back of the pendant, I guess it's okay. I was disappointed."
2,Not that much of a page turner-A Michael Connelly wanna be,"I found her writing to be very elementary - and uninteresting. The most interesting part of this book is that I learned about the children - and of course that in itself was sad. However, the story line did not engage me."
2,"Foul weather off the port bow, Mateys!","I have the latest ""Desert Island Films"" 2011 release of this movie. This is a washed out print, faded color, variable lighting. It looks like a dub of a bad VHS print, or recorded off a broadcast. Sometimes the image is sharp and clear, sometimes it looks out of focus. However, it is the only current DVD available. There are no chapters, no menu, you just put the DVD in and it plays. It even cuts off the closing scene prematurely.I was not favorably impressed by the script, acting, or direction of this film. Newton hams it up, but can't save this sinking ship.There are many fine sea yarns on film, but this is not one of them. Despite its detractors, I foundCutthroat Islandto be vastly superior to this bilge."
1,Absolute Trash,"Amazon needs to have -0 stars as a rating choice. This group does not deserve even 1 star. Why would Amazon lower themselves even carrying this crap. You call this music? I listened to it to gather some background on Jim Derogitis (Sun Times so-called critic) and can now understand why he pans legitimate artists - he hasn't a clue. Do us a favor, Jim - throw out your drumsticks. You stink."
4,A SHARP debut from Angela Winbush!,"Angela Winbush's solo debut SHARP, is indeed a sharp piece of work. One half of the Rene & Angela duo, Ms. Winbush is an accomplished writer, producer, arranger, and an excellent vocalist. Her writing is R&B at it's best. Her later work with The Isley Brothers will prove that. On this excellent debut, the stand outs are the masterful ballads. On first listen, you'll be transfixed with the gut-wrenching ballads on the ""Quiet Storm Side."" You Had A Good Girl, No One Has Cared (Like You), Hello Beloved, and the hit, Angel, provide the steam needed for any romantic evening. Though the funky cuts on the ""Slammin' Side"" sound dated, Sensual Lover still holds up as a smooth R&B jewel. The other cuts were very good indeed for their time. This is a worthy debut from a lady as talented as they come. She's proven this on her two susequent releases as well."
4,Buy This,"I'm more of the type that listens to heavy metal or harder rock then Daphne Loves Derby, but every so often i like to calm it down and listen to something mellow, and this is the cd i listen to. It's a great cd and everyone should buy it."
3,5 Shaolin Masters,"I saw this in a theater back in the 70's. This is a martial arts classic as the various fight scenes will show several styles of Kung Fu not normally known to most people. The dubbed voice overs are kind of corny as most films of this genre were back in the day but then people who view these movies could care less. It's strictly about the fight scenes.It's ok, I'm glad to own a copy of this movie."
4,A must have for patty loveless fans.,"This is one of her best CD's. ""A thoundan times a day"" is my fav. song. A lot of very good songs here that did not get on her ""Classic"" CD in 1999. Whitch is why you shound not buy her grestest hits CD ""Classic""."
5,Johnsons Nursing Pads 60 CT,Ordered for my granddaughter to assist her when the new great granddaughter was born. These are her favorite pads...good product.
4,Best disposable pad that I've found,I really like these pads. I tried at least 5 different disposable pads and these are my favorite. I make lots of milk and leak often. These absorb the best. Most comfortable as well. Packed nicely. I abhor the ones that are wrapped individually. What new mom wants to take the time to unwrap every pad?
3,"Not their best, but good tunes!","A few memorable tracks make it worth the purchase at under [price], but some of it is forgettable early '90s fodder with the bonus track editions not being of much substance."
2,Not enough description,The book is not so informative who would like to understand the detailed functions of SAP PP module. The book contains no picture or screen shot. It's dealt with various functions but it doesn't seem to be enough.
5,classic allman,"I was introduced to the allman brothers in 1969 living in metro atlanta.I became an instant fan following their history. Contrary to Amazon's information, Laid back was released in 1973-not 2001. Laid back took a country turn adding a feel not heard from allman before then. As with the vast majority of Greg Allman tunes, the music hits home and adds another introspective narrative in the phenominal Allman Brothers journey."
4,Southern Rock Review,After watching a program on CMT on the history of southern rock I ordered this CD. What a pleasure it has been - even the cover of Jackson Browne's THESE DAYS - Gregg's voice is so sweet. A must have for true fans.
5,Why is this CD not available?,"This is an incredible album by a sometimes mediocre artist...but when he's on, he is the essence of a Georgia summer night and this album is an example. A fantastic collection of music..."
2,Silencer From Da Thugz,Dis cd iz off da hook fo real silencer is one of the best mexican rapper out thurr right now get this cd now silencer from da califa thugz he is one of my favorite mexican rappers right now
4,"Read, Write, Edit: Grammer for College Writters - Jon's Review",Acceptable book. It does the job! There are activities that have been filled out but it helps me complete my tasks faster and it helps me learn from any mistake there may be in the completed activities because I go over what others filled out and make neccessary correction.
4,Great fun!,Gene Autry was a great man & it's wonderful that you are offering his old movies to relive this era of such a great person. He & all the older stars will not be forgotten as long as you offer such items. Thanks!
2,Where's the Beef?,"I am thrilled that there are C.D.'s w/Opera for Karaoke! What I am NOT thrilled about,(and the reason for the 2 stars, because the quality of the product is fine), is that at $25.00 per C.D., the marketers COULD HAVE given a little more 'bang for the buck'! You get ONE, count IT, ONE popular aria on each disc, so that to get 4 or 5 recognizable songs to perform for friends, you have to spend between $100.00 to $150.00 ! This is OUTRAGEOUS gouging of the consumer. Tell you what; How about putting 1.Una furtiva lagrima-2. La donna e mobile-3. M'appari tutt' d'amor-4. Vesti la Giubba-5. Recondita armonia-6. Che gelida manina and 7. Nessun Dorma on one C.D. for $39.99 and let the die-hards who must have all pay for the more obscure tracks? Frankly, I am insulted in the marketers presumption, unless someone is interested in only one or two tracks, this set is DEFINITELY geared to GOUGE the consumer! SHUFFLE THE CARDS AND TRY AGAIN!"
4,RE: beautiful,"Beautiful music, I really enjoye listening to this kind of music, it's soothing. I like the instrumentals, with no vocals."
3,Interesting but no Oscar,"Sure, Alex Jones is uncovering plenty of dirty dealings in the US, and one day hopefully those duplicitous villains will get their comeuppance. In the meanwhile we must do all we can to protect our hard-won liberties.I only wish he could have been more creative in presenting the subject: surely he must have some relevant video clips to break up the endless procession of talking heads, who admittedly each made convincing and cases.Watch in batches of no more than 20 minutes to avoid drowsiness....."
4,Great Set,I am a Party of Five fan and loved the first season so I naturally pre-ordered the DVD.Its great to see these episodes again and the special features are interesting to watch. The DVD quality is amazing.Not sure i'd buy season 3 to 6 if they came out - I didn't enjoy them much after season 2
5,wow,"seeing this show again was like seeing it for the first time, and it has made my life so much better. they just dont make shows like this anymore. neve campbell and lacey chabert are fantastic beyond words. and the ""boys"" really bring it all together. seriously if you have never seen this show or havent watched in a long time, you absolutely have to buy these dvds. they dont seem to be particularly edited and with few exceptions, the music is intact. party on.."
4,Not just for Teens,"I had forgotten how superb the acting is in this show. So many life lessons that you can show your teenagers as they discover this beautifully scripted show with you. Lacey Chabert steals the show with her wisdom and heart felt performance. I love the dichotomey between the family members. Each personality shining through as is customary in every family which helps keep this drama more realistic. The struggles they go through because their parents are not there to guide them and help in the moral choices they face each day just as we all do help to keep this grounded and foster its appeal. The last episode on disc 2 is so riveting. For those that have not seen it I will not spoil it for you, but suffice it to say it is some TV's finest dramatic moments that we do not see to this calliber any longer. The issues that are dealt with are timeless."
5,Other Seasons,The Party of Five series was awsome!!! I was so happy when the first season came out on DVD. Now Im patiently waiting for the next seasons to arrive on DVD. When will we get more Party of Five!!!!! Make the fans happy and bring out more seasons of the show!!!!
2,Crapfest,"This show is kinda boring. I remember watching it in middle school and liking it, but it's not that great. I didn't finish the set. I might sell it."
2,You don't get what You see,"The photo shown here does not apply to the item described. The photo shows thisoutlet to be complete with a circuit breaker. Not so, the box is much smaller withonly the outlet. Very misleading."
1,Terrible Construction,"I bought this mattress from my local Baton Rouge, LA Babies R Us storeand took it home, assuming it would be perfect, as it was still in its original plastic wrapping. The minute we opened the plastic wrapping covering the mattress, we saw there was a large split in the fabric along the mattress' seam. I returned the mattress, thinking we'd just exchange it for another one just like it. Well, the nest two they brought out for me to look at were also splitting at the seams...not what one expects from a mattress costing in the upper range of baby mattresses. THe local store didn't carry Colgate, and I didn't want to wait for an online order, so we went to another local store and got the Colgate from that store & are VERY pleased with it."
1,Bugs Bugs Bugs!,"I purchased a Swheat Scoop Natural Wheat Litter bag at PETCO, but did not noticed initially that it had bugs I believe are called wheat weevils. They are reddish and are flea-like and when I was replacing some used litter, I scooped out some new litter and noticed all these bugs were trying to bore themselves into the litter. I was so disgusted! NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY WHEAT LITTER FOR MY CAT! I will now have to check to see if they traveled on my cat to areas like the mattress."
3,Not as good as volume 1...,"This one is not as good as the first volume, but there are some really beautiful songs on this collection, and it serves as a fine companion volume to the first. If you like Best of Bee Gees vol. 1, you should like this one too."
3,DON'T WANT TO LIVE INSIDE MYSELF!,"ONE THE VERY BEST BALLADS THE BEE GEES HAVE EVER DONE ,NEVER GET TIRED OF IT TO THIS DAY!ALWAY'S LOVELY TO HEAR IT!J.H.H.{THE BROWN EYED SOUL BROTHER OF DOVER PA."
5,A Great Collection,"I bought this years ago, and it's fantastic. A great collection of their earlier hits, before their flirtation with ""Disco"". I especially liked ""Melody Fair"" and ""Morning Of My Life"" (aka ""In The Morning"") which were both so beautifully utilized in the film ""Melody"". Every time I hear them I see Tracy Hyde's lovely face."
4,Excellent Compilation!,"This is an excellent compilation and and great follow-up to Greatest Hits Vol. 1. The album in CD format is the same as the original vinyl release except for some unknown reason, they left off Wouldn't I Be Someone, a very superb recording. However, it is found on the boxed set. I definately would recommend this to any Bee Gees fan."
4,Hiddden Treasures with Potholes,"This is a very interesting album. Too much of the music is over-produced and has not aged well since it's late 60s release. However, there is some very bright light at the end of the tunnel. ""Long Haired Soulful"" is an amazing artifact from the pschedelic years. It is pretty well written and absolutely performed with incredible virtuosity. The big surprise is that the players on this track, as well as backing on a couple of others, are the pre-Joe Walsh James Gang. Lead vocals by Phil Giallombardo, drums by Jimmy Fox, Bass by Tom Kriss, and Lead Guitar by the then miraculous Glenn Schwartz.None of the credits are provided on the album, but those who were present in the Cleveland music scene at that time will remember this awesome track.Too bad the rest of the album is so, how shall I say this, awful.Well worth the price for this track alone, though."
4,A Crazy Game,"Heir Apparent is about a girl who is trapped in a video game. She has to go through many challenges, fight a dragon, and defeat many gruesome killers.I recommend this book to all young readers who play oodles of video games and love action. Hope ya' like it!!!"
5,Must Read,"This book is wonderful for pre-teens to teenage girls. While I normally dislike a female lead I found this one to be refreshing. She doesn't whine or complain, and most certainly does not lean on any males for help (like inTwilight). If you are a fan of Hermoine from Harry Potter then you would enjoy this book."
4,Fresh Sounds From Way Out,"I agree with most of the reviews, amazing disc of music. The freshest cuts in my mind are by the newer artists on this compiltation. The cuts by 33, Pete DeVriese, and Baiyon are so entirely original they really stand out. It's hard even to see what these three artists were influenced by musically. Other great cuts by the regular Moog crew of Stereolab, Tortoise, and Bernie Worrell are neat as well but don't really get at the experimental side of the Moog sound as the three newer artists do. But I would still rate the cuts by those artists at 3 Stars. The new artists get 5 Stars."
5,I love theese!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Every since I logged on the web site I emeadiatly found out they had dolls!.Once I got my first one (Flora)I fell in love with it.Then I got Stella, I knew wich one I was going to get next,Bloom!.I got them All from you Toys R Us, ThanksSincerelyDelaney!"
4,A good detective read,"Just sent this novel to some shrink friends. As usual, the author offers crisp narrative (well rendered by a supple translation), a panorama of vivdly drawn characters, a strong sense of time and place (O Jerusalem!), and a plot of decent complication. As well, there are the author's usual faults: a somewhat pretentious detailing of the rituals and nomenclature of a heuristic community; and, as with all women authors (yes!!) of detective stories, she adores her hero, who is much too good to be true (see, for example, Cmndr Dalgliesh or Lord Peter or Marshal Guarnaccia or Commisario Brunetti, etc., etc; is Mr Darcy the prototype Ms hero?). The author offers a novel's eye-view of upper-middle-class, cosmopolitan Jerusalem in the late 1980s. Sharply written, this novel aims, patently, to instruct as well as to entertain. As usual, with the latter, the author succeeds."
2,Tough sledding,"Missed opportunity. Filled with restatements, self-serving quotes, warm and fuzzy verbiage, etc. Could have been condensed down to a 75 page book by a sharp editor."
4,A Very Educational Game,"We bought this game for our 4-year old boy to give him a plain old ""fun"" game for his PC. He has 3 other games that are purely educational (yet fun) - Jump Start Spanish, Reader Rabbit Phonics, and Blue's Clues 1-2-3 - so we thought he should have some old-fashioned fun.This game is much more educational than we anticipated. Although it is chock-full-of-games, we have been impressed with the level of detail in the artwork, and the fact that our son is able to rattle off the names of several dinosaurs, AND tell you whether they eat meat, plants, etc.The underlying story behind the games (collect dinosaur eggs to save the island from T-Rex) is pretty weak, but the games and the educational value of the game are very strong.Our son thinks the game is great. It is definitely his favorite - he asks to play all the time. Something about dinosaurs that just gets kids going, I guess."
5,GREAT for pre-scoolers,"I got this game for my 4 year old son. He has not stopped playing it for weeks! I also have a 5 1/2 year old daugther in kidergarten who just loves the games. They could both use the software with no directions from us. It has good games, very good sound effects, and best of all: it gives quick, one sentence educational information about the dinosaurs - perfect for their short attention span."
5,Good book,"The book starts good with basic stuff and slowly gets hard. There is lots of usefull infermation and handy tips. The stuff really gets yuo lerning, and I think its well worth reading even if like me you dont known much about microcontrollers."
5,"Perfect, even the second time around!","This is definitely in my top 5 shows of all time. Watching the re-runs never gets old. The characters all fit their roles and each performance comes naturally. Everything is completely genuine, and nothing ever seems forced. I have the first set and I loved the packageing and the layout of the menus. The studio stuck to the exact same format for the second season as well, there are no annoying credits to go throw each episode, and this time around the opening song isn't repeated on every episode, it just goes straight to the story which is really convienant.The packaging is the same as well, which is a plus, 4 individual slim cases insted of annoying fold out cases that seem flimsy. I love That 70's Show, and I love the DVD sets. Definitely a must have if you are a fan of the show, they have high replay value and the jokes don't grow old."
5,This really shows some spark in this series.,I liked season 1 but season 2 is by far the best I've seen in this series so far. Personally I think that what did it for me is the season 2 finale where Jackie bought pot for god knows what when she had given it to Hyde the police gave it to him even though it wasn't his. That was great. I can't wait to see the rest of the whole series myself!
5,GREAT SONGS!,"I had this album but loved the songs so I ordered the cd. There are songs on this album that are not included in any other of his ""hits"" cds and they should be. I love it and crank it up! Rod Stewart is one of my all time favorites."
4,Good Read!,"My first Edgar Wallace. Interesting mystery, plenty of unexpected turns, plenty of suspects. A fun read."
5,One of my favorite metal albums EVER,"There aren't really the words to describe how mind-bendingly amazing this CD is, but I'll give you a few anyway. First of all, the guitar playing is out of this world. I don't think I've heard better guitars on any album. The vocals are growled with enough passion and energy to make even the most skeptical metalhead stand up and take notice. But the band brings more to the table than just the usual hardcore/metal formula of recycled Iron Maiden riffs and hardcore growls: they also incorporate elements of classical guitar, jazz (not so much on this disc), and even some moments of pop punk (there's one part in there...you'll find it). If you want to play the old game of naming similar bands, here goes: imagine Burnt By the Sun playing intricate, techincally-adept, soaring guitar solos. Or, you could picture Dissection with a metalcore twist. Or you could just buy the freaking CD."
1,Should have done his homework,"This has to be one of the worst books on lobstering I have ever read. The information is poorly researched, and the quality of the illustrations are also, sadly, second rate. I have read in his biography that Mr. Pallotta was a lobster fisherman, but sadly he has done his fellow fisherman a grave diservice in writing this book..."
4,"System II Pre-Filter Sleeve 12/pk - 16 - 20""",These work as they should. They are a little bigger than I thought and are open at both ends but are ok.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SCALE!,"Be warned! I purchased this scale new and had to return it. It never worked. When I turned it on I got a quick flash of a 0.0 and then dotted lines. I leveled it with a leveling bubble and continued to get the lines. The manual does not have any answers so I went to their website ""[...]"". I could not find anything to help me in the ""Support"" section or the ""Help"" section. I really needed to weigh packages for mailing and I can't believe the company doesn't even have a troubleshooting guide. I even got the engineer next door to look at it and we decided it is just garbage and a big waste of money and TIME!! Save yourself."
1,Beware of this book,"This book is very generic and could be about many areas. The sections of the book that are about on Florida are very vague.These Florida information sections could fill maybe one page.Truly this book was the least helpful book I have read about Florida, and it is supposed to be about relocating there?This book is really not going to help find that perfect location.It has some good points about moving, but they could easily be about Texas, or Marylans, or Hawaii.Do you self a favor and stay away from this book, a complete waste of money."
5,True to its title!,"One thing is for sure - you will sweat! Thus, you will get an excellent workout. Be warned that this is high energy, and Kari loves turns, so be careful. Don't try everything at once, and don't be afraid to leave out jumps and turns until you are more familiar with the choreography. Some days I have to hit the pause button and walk around to catch my breath, but I'm always so proud of myself when I finish. This is an older style of aerobics that you don't see much anymore, and it's a nice change from more ""modern"" workouts."
3,Would be great if slowed down 10-20%,"This tape uses a lot of moves that were popular in high-impact aerobics classes back in the 80's and early 90's. I don't have a problem with that, but the tape just moves too fast. I can't execute the moves as fast as they do on the tape, at least not with anything like a full range of motion. A very short person might be able to. I was disappointed in the tape and can't really get a good workout from it. It is also weak in the pre-stretching and cooldown."
3,IT'S NOT JAWS BUT IT'S PRETTY DAMN GOOD!,"This is one of those movies that you think will really be bad. It turns out it is a pretty good little thriller with some sci-fi thrown in. The biggest weakness is that the sharks don't always look that realistic. I am a hugh fan of Jaws and this is not in the same league, but it does deliver the goods."
3,Not as good as expected to be,this movie is awesome action but poor horror i mean i thought they wouldnt just stay in the floating thing all way through the movie and the deaths are so incredibly fast and most of them were fake like the shark it looks like he was wiping the walls with that guy and there is more than one shark and they could be bigger.this is still reccomended by me for action and suspense but horror?no way!
1,A Wast Of Time,"JAWS was even way better than Deep Blue Sea. Terrible acting. It was an OK film. But it just needed more better ""special effects"" in the movie. All it's manily about is three sharks that these researchers are studying on to make them get ""smarter"" I guess that's what you would say. And they escape the place and start attacking the people. Bad graphic shark attacks, I'll have to admit. Near towards the end of the movie, you don't know what will happen. If you're asking me, don't bother seeing this movie. If you haven't yet seen JAWS, you must see that one instead. Way better than Deep Blue Sea."
2,Good sharks/Bad movie,"Quite frankly this movie bored me. Yes the sharks are incredibly, but the story was thin and the acting was dull. Yes there were some gory parts, and yes the sharks were a wonder to behold, but that doesn't make up for this dull movie. Scary? No. What made JAWS scary is that they didn't show much of the shark. It's hard to be afraid of these ""smart"" sharks when they throw them in your face every few minutes."
1,I'd rather be shot,"Deep Blue Sea was, by far, one of the worst movies I've seen in ages. The plot looks good on paper, but it turned weak in a hurry. The special effects are weak, to say the least...and that's all that could have saved this film. Poor acting skills, a horrible screenplay, and bad special effects made this film as entertaining as a visit to the VD clinic."
3,as good as jaws but in a different way,"I thought that Jaws was a great movie as I kind of liked that big old fish. This movies only drawback is with 3 starring attractions, none of the sharks get to develop a personality for the movie goer. They are only sharks one, two, and three. Still, watching the sharks go after the scientists that imprisoned them was kind of fun, and the ""gore and blood"" scenes are so obviously computer generated that they did not disgust me. Highly recommended for when you have friends over."
4,Great Movie!,"I loved this movie. I loved the special effects and the sharks seems realistic unlike the sharks in ""Jaws"". I have a fascination in sharks so I was excited to see this movie. It was even better then I hoped for and it keep me really excited. I loved the part when LL Cool J had to hop into the oven to save himself from a shark, that was just too cool. The moment of surprise with Samuel L. Jackson was pretty good too, made me jump! A must see movie for thrill-seekers and shark lovers!"
1,One of the worst of 1999,"I absolutely loathed ""Deep Blue Sea"", a cheap, CGI-bloated, and haphazardly written ""Jaws"" derivative! This piece of cinematic dross ranks up there with ""The Matrix"", ""The Haunting"", ""Blair Witch Project"", and ""Phantom Menace"" as one of the most overhyped duds of 1999. Samuel L. Jackson should know better than to squander his talent as he most certainly did in this outing!"
1,Please - This Is Rubbish,"I am not going to waste much time on writing this - it was in my shopping basket until I was fortunate enough to watch it on a business trip. It was rapidly deleted.As an action/horror film attempting to go against the likes of Jurrasic Park, Jaws etc. this fails miserably. I will credit it with some sense of suspense, however the effects and storyline are - as always - at odds. For every dollar spent in the 'lab' creating the sharks and blood, a dollar was lost from the realitly and story.How the magnificent Samuel L. Jackson was signed up to this is a mystery - presumeably it was a favour or a bet/debt?A definite - 'Don't Bother'."
3,Deep Blue Sea,"Deep Blue Sea is one of those dumb but fun action thrillers with enough humour and excting action set-pieces to cover it's flaws. Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, the Long Kiss Goodnight) adds plenty of intense, fast-paced action to satisfy audiences.Still, it's no Jaws, and by the first half hour, plausibility and subtlety go out the window in favour of one big over-the top action scene after another. And one by one, the hapless people stuck in a gradually sinking laboratory get picked off in increasingly gory ways. It's entertaining to see them get munched, but unlike Jaws, you don't care about the characters, and subsequently want to see them become fish food.But it is fun, and in turns, unpredictable and exciting. Forget about the script and hackneyed plot and enjoy."
2,The out takes would have improved the movie,"I confess, i like this kind of stuff. I'd buy anything that had giant monsters in it. Jaws was still done better although the EFX are better by far in this one. Watching the out takes on the DVD cued me in on the problem. The director cut the character development for action and I ended up liking the shark more than the people. Not good for this kind of movie. Should you buy it? If you like Jason and the Argonauts, Sinbad movies, giant ant movies, and classic 60's horror you will probably like this. If you liked Jaws with it superior characters, you will not like this. I need to like one character at least in each movie, LL Cool J came close but he was played too much toward comedy. The lead hero was stiff. The sharks were way cool though. Go sharks."
1,JAWS 2000...........not good.......,"Many Steven Spielberg's JAWS fanatics may have had a BIG dissapointment with this movie. Why?1)Lame special effects2)Really bad acting....I mean...real bad.3)The plot is amazingly....dumb.DO NOT waste your time watching this movie. Nevertheless, I'm sure that if you haven't seen it yet you'll watch it anyway...(I know I did) so by when the movie is over please remember this review saying: ""I told you so"""
5,A Good Entertaining Movie,"This movie was very good.From start to finish the movie delivered action and trillers.I had a great time watching this movie in the theater and on DVD.The film did not go the same route that many other horror/trillers have gone in the past.There are a few surprises and its just one of those films you watch to be entertained.I liked it and if you have not seen it yet, I would recommend that you do.There are a few shots in the movie, the sharks does look fake, but there are many other scenes of the sharks that look great.(Those few shots are not a big deal)Give this movie a try, especially for those that love a violent survival to the finish movie."
4,So bad it's good,"By any objective measure, Deep Blue Sea is a terrible movie. The story is ridiculous, the acting phoned in by actors who have done better and can do better, the dialogue inane, filmed with a color palette that does not deviate from the cliched teal/orange designed to pop and look cool. But, it's so ridiculous that it's just plain fun. You can't take it seriously, so you just go along with it. The Blu-Ray has the same features as previous DVDs, while the picture and sound are excellent. (By the way, a fun little tidbit: The sharks die in the same way and order as the sharks in the Jaws movies - blown up, electrocuted, blown up.)"
1,I wish the sharks had won . . . and early on,"because this was just a waste of time. Elvira please take note, this ones for your show. I agree with the one reviewer who said they felt they lowered their IQ by watching this nonsense. Anyone that could say something good about any part of this film must be extremely easy to entertain. On a positive note, if you find anyone who enjoyed this film, you can take their opinions as a contrary indicator.. . Now if only the sharks escaped then went up the L.A. river and ate the producers and actors of this film by snatching them from their cars as they commuted to work. That would be just as easy to believe as the rest of it. Extremely bad acting on all accounts."
1,Because you can't give 0 stars...,"This is absolutely the worst movie ever made. I knew it was going to be bad when I first started watching it, but then they killed Samuel L. not even half way through the movie. That, and LL Cool J is in it make this not-scary-at-all movie the worst EVER."
5,I loved this movie!!!!!,"I know that it was kind of corny, but what do you expect, it's not reality! I loved this movie, I've watched it 3 times and I'm planning on buying it! Alot of my friends thought it was a bit too much, I just loved it!! Most movies about human-eating animals are pretty silly, but this one was awesome and very entertaining!"
4,It's good for night in!,"Hey, if you love the Jaws films this is five star winner! I brought it before seeing the movie. It's one of those films you can either get really stuck into and scare yourself stupid, or sit there and just rip it to pieces with your mates - both equally entertaining! Enjoy!"
1,Budget Wasted on Effects - That are not all that Special,"The acting so poor, to enjoy this piece of cheese one ought to be given a bottle of wine with it. The one-liners are not all that funny, and it appears as if the money was spent on some visual effects and a lead actor. Do yourself a favor and purchase Jaws instead. If one is prone to very simple things, like watching paint dry, or grass grow, this will be the perfect movie for them. If, on the other hand, you are interested in plot development, and seeing some actual effort put into the dialog and acting, then this movie is not for you."
2,Mean-spirited and poorly researched,"Trust me, I love a good ""Tell All"" book. I've just finished reading some juicy little numbers about Truman Copote and Nancy Reagan...MEOW!But ""Dark Place"" is neither compelling nor believable. It describes the researcher Birute Galdikas, who has spent years following orangutans in the jungle and is now considered the foremost researcher on these delightful hairy beasts. I was hoping for some really salacious details, but this book was more or less a yawn. I hear that Birute is now in the process of suing the author and has dozens of witnesses to discredit Spalding.So do yourself a favor. If you want a great book about Orangutans and the research about them, buy ""Reflections of Eden."" If you want some well-written, brilliantly-researched cattiness, read ""The Women of Camelot."" But if you're looking for a combination of the two, well, the story has yet to be written."
2,disappointed,"This was not as funny as some of his other dvds. There was a lot of repetition and the addition of ""Aunt Swanita"" didn't do anything for it."
2,Not for Beginners,"As a teacher in the Oracle Internet Academy, I can attest to the fact that this book is NOT for beginners. The publishers would have you believe that a complete novice can learn Java with this course, yet the book makes regular references to other programming languages. A colleague of mine has supplemented his course with the ""Dummies"" book, and he says that it covers the material in a more ""beginner oriented"" way. I came into the class with no programming experience, and after reading the book 4 times I am looking for more help. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think so."
1,FOR OLDER READERS!,"I myself am a Nancy Drew fan and this book portrays Nancy in a crude way,in this book deception is on every page(Deception in the story,not what is written)! I view the excitment as part of the problem,it had too much going on in one page and is boring and drab on the next! It is not a book I would recemend for younger readers(I'm a young person myself and I found it HORRIBLE!),and if you're a Nancy fan then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! Some other problems I saw were that Nancy seems less of a figure for young people-expecily girl-and the prospect of Nancy doing anything shady is VERY disterbing. The writing was good and some of the plots were awsome,but besides that I can't say that the book was any good. The book also seems to highlight Nancy's mistakes in life,it doesn't really mention anything good that she did. Once gain I say that the book is for OLDER readers and not for the young ones."
2,Confessions of a Teen Sleuth,"This book is silly and formulaic. It sounded as if it would be funny and interesting, but it isn't very good. I didn't finish it."
1,All it did was tangle my hair,"I have long, naturally curly hair, and although this claims to be ""tangle free"" it kept on getting caught in my hair so badly I could not use it. Wigo is actually Helen of Troy, Wigo being the company's ""higher end"" line or products-curling irons, but what's strange is that this is the only hot air brush Wigo makes, Helen of Troy makes so many. Not worth the money if you have long curly hair, mega-disappointed!"
3,Free Willy 2,"I think that Basil Poledouris has composed another wonderful score for another Free Willy film. I wish more of his music could have been heard. I love his score. The rest of the songs are ok, and I think Michael Jackson's Childhood is no where near as good as Will You Be There. Thank you."
5,best claymation ever,"Of all the claymation videos I've seen, this is the best. All the shorts are interesting and there is a wide variety. My all time favorite, though, is A Christmas Gift. For laughs, I enjoy the Great Cognito and the two ""movie critics"" never fail to get me laughing."
2,alright could be better,"roman candel is all right today [friday] they gave us a concert at my high school, they should come up with their own songs. out of everyone at my school about 30% of all the students went to the concert and left in 5minutes"
4,Bought this as a Gift for my Wife,"I becames a fan of Dobson in the 1970's, by way of Bob Dylan. Her soaring vocal range is in a class by itself, and her haunting lyrics will never leave you. The orchestral backing may seem corny today, but it's a good example of what things were like back when Hippies roamed the Earth, and we didn't take ourselves so seriously."
1,Super agree with super mom,"I totally agree with super mom, it is a junk. I received it and the toy were not working. Assuming that there were a problem with the battery, I changed it right away. But even thought I've changed with new batteries, the toys still never worked. The worst thing is, the walker is so light that my son bumped his back to the floor when he tried to pull himself up. I was going to exchange it, but it's hard to unassemble it. So I decided to trash it. What a waste!"
1,Terrible toy. Handle broke while daughter was using it to stand up.,Do not purchase this toy. My 18 month old used the handle to help her stand up and the screw holding the handle in place snapped in half causing her to fall.
3,"Not a good walker, but loads of fun.","This toy is front heavy which make it difficult to push, and easy to topple forward. The low clearance of the body to the floor, makes it difficult to push on any surface that is not hard, such as wall to wall carpet, or even small rugs on a flat surface. However, despite its ineffectiveness as a walker, my son has enjoyed this toy tremendously. I bought this 2nd hand and had no problems with any of the features not working. If you don't use this as a walker, I'd say it's still worth buying for the entertainment aspect of the console."
2,Avoid,I picked this up cheap a few years ago. The recorded sound is excellent. The playing is plodding. I never really enjoyed most of this -- a few pieces here and there but not overall. And the other keyboard works are done ... on the organ! The Goldbergs for organ.There is so much good Bach out there you don't need to settle for this.
2,Not the best starter module ever written,"It's playability is slow, not overly challenging. The story line is average at best. It's good enough just to get the ball rolling is a campaign setting thats just starting off, but there are a lot better modules out there for low to novice level characters in my opinion."
5,The Insect World of J. Henri Fabre,This book is a treasure. I first read it in college and it totally changed the way I viewed insects. Fabre has a very engaging writing style and his dedication and patience provide many insights into the insect's nature. Now I am looking forward to sharing it with my teenage daughters.
1,Waste of Money!,"This was the biggest disappointment ever! I bought this as a Christmas gift, and unfortunately I lost the shipping/receive order so i can't send it back. The instructions are very poor, and someone has handwritten some of them in because they forgot to put them on the original print. I was going to deal with the cheapness of the product except for the fact that one of the frame pieces is incorrect, so I can't even assemble the thing. Keep looking, and don't waste your time. I would spend a little more money and upgrade to one that is nicer!"
4,"Good, but old","I love the music, but you know...not all these songs are sung on Seseme Street these days. That is sorta sad. My son likes it, but he is a little young right now."
5,A delightful toe tappin CD that children under two will love,"Sesame Street Platinum is a delightful CD. My little one is under two and enjoys the rhythms and different voices from each song. Plus the songs are not childish. All of the tunes are very modern and include a delightful message about caring, sharing and being yourself."
4,I might like it more than my son.,"I bought this CD along with a Wiggles CD in anticipation of a 2 day car trip we were making with our 20 month old son. The songs are wonderful and we all (my husband, my son, and myself) really enjoy it. Truthfully, I think my son prefers the wiggles because he recognises the songs more and they are all more upbeat. However, its a lot easier for us adults to listen to the Sesame Street over and over and over. One comment is that these songs were recorded a while ago, so some of the characters sound a little bit different than they do now."
4,Taking a poke at Lawyers - my favorite kind of jokes,"So there I was peacefully sitting out on my mother's veranda when I decided that some reading was in order. I had just received my copy of ""Disorder in the Court"" and settled down. As expected there were moments of great mirth and just good old fashioned belly laughs. I soon had to be reading the entire book to my mother who laughed until ""her laughing bag buss"" ( a Jamaican terminology)and speedily depleted my cell phone credit calling friends to read jokes to them.There were a few flat moments - but you can't have everything. An excellent compilation nonetheless"
3,Funny One,"I love to read or hear stories of people's mistakes, not so much because I like to laugh at people, but because it makes me feel better about my own mistakes -- I know I'm not alone.I did enjoy this book generally, but I have to say that I was quite disappointed in the number of exchanges included that were off-color and/or foul-mouthed. I know that in many ways this just reflects people in real life, but this is precisely why these aren't so funny. It's the things that are out of the ordinary that that catch me off guard and make me laugh."
1,Foul language warning,I only got four pages into the first chapter when I encountered foul language. I did not expect or want to read such tripe. Glad I got my copy at the library to review first. It's going straight back to the library. Perhaps we should place warnings on books like they do for TV and movies.
2,Not Funny,unlike the advance clips the book as a whole was not funny. In a lot of cases it was boring.
3,Funny but MEH,"Disorder in the court was funny, but would probably be funnier if you were a lawyer with a weak sense of humor. I found myself chuckling at several of the passages but others went over my head due to the legalese used. This is probably a great book for a lawyer that you need to buy a gift for but don't want to spend a bunch of money and don't really like all that much. They will think you are thoughtful and you will look cool. Then while they are talking about yourself next time you are at their house you can flip through it while he is talking about himself."
5,OZZY!,"Maybe Ozzy's best-selling album ever...maybe his easiest and softest album ever too...there's many peaceful songs ""Mama I'm Coming home"", ""Road to Nowhere"", and ""Time After Time"" and that is more than any other albums's has had before this album. Well, there's of course great hard rock/metal songs ""Mr. Tinkertrain"", ""No More Tears"", ""I Don't Want to Change the World"", ""Desire"", ""Zombie Stomp"", and ""Hellraiser"". They are good stuff with the ballads. Ozzy sings very good and the sound is much better than it was in ""Blizzard of Ozz""...that's why I like this one so much.Stars: Mama, I'm Coming Home, Mr. Tinkertrain, No More Tears"
1,HUMILIATION,"HELLO,I PAID MONEY FOR NEW SEALED CD HOWEVER WHEN I RECEIVED CD IT WAS FULL OF SCRATHES ON CD ITSELF, ON CD SACE AND EVEN IT WAS FINGERTRIPS ON YOUR CD// IT WAS JUST REASEALED.HONESTLY SPEAKING I DON'T WANT TO BUY FROM YOU ANYMOREOLD CUSTOMER OF AMAZON.COM"
1,Requires paid membership after a couple weeks of play,"This sounded like a great idea, software that was my computer rather than having my kids clicking through various websites. They love it, the games are fun and have a little academic value. We mostly got it so my son could work on his mouse and keyboard skills. It did that beautifully until he got into the second of I believe 5 worlds and required a membership. I was willing to pay nearly $20 for a complete world of games, but not one partial game that addicted my kids then wanted $8 per month. Don't waste your time!"
2,a bit disappointed,"I thought this was a pretty good buy because it is after all a known brand and my previous set was also from Mikasa. However, when i received my package, one of the dinner plates had a brown stain - very obvious (a long line right on the middle of the plate). Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complain because I had this shipped to Manila and it would be quite difficult to have it returned.The set looks great, but I did not receive all the pieces in perfect condition."
1,Rustico,"I would love to review it; however, I never received it. Yes, I have written you and got no response. In other words, you have both my money and my book!"
2,Really mediocre,"This is Deep Purple at the bottom, releasing a mediocre set of songs aimed directly to sound commercial and almost pop at some points.Of course, when you talk about Paice, Blackmore, Lord and Glover, you will always find some great stuff in the middle of this waste, given that they are such stupendous musicians.Have no doubt: this is the ""Bent Out of Shape"" of Deep Purple's discography. (for those who don't know, Bent Out Of Shape was the last Rainbow album with Joe Lynn Turner - and it's disastrous, an abomination.)"
5,A very good album,"This album received criticism from Purple fans, but on a musical level, it possessed some excellent material. 'King of Dreams' is a fabulous song, as good as any material Purple had put together since it had reformed. It is a big shame that 'Fire, Ice and Dynamite' was not included on the album, as it is a great rocking song and has a blistering beginning."
3,Cheap,Very cheap and not a very good product. We had trouble keeping the wire attached and also had a power surge because of a wire slipping off.
1,extraneous and virtually useless,"i was not happy with these exercises...i found the exercises limited and didn't hear an ""awakened"" voice afterwards. unfortunately, the tape i received at a session i had taken previously was destroyed side by side, it just couldn't compare. does not warm up all the multi-facets that make up a voice. dull, disappointing and a loss of my money."
3,simple but useful,if you need a quick warm up this is great. not very taxing for a pro but in warm ups anything helps. put it on my ipod and practice in the car!
5,What about the Turk-Cypriots?,"No one has right to criticise one of the countries greece or turkey more than one another. Stop putting the blame on only turks, cant u guys be more rational. Do not forget , as well as greeks there, turks are also living on that island"
1,Sad to ignore a people's tragedy,"Turkey has invaded Cyprus in 1974.There is a self-proclaimed state in the norht, recognizedonly by Turkey, and branded as illegal by the United Nations.I think a book-guide to ""North Cyprus"" would be equivalentto a guide book to South Africa during the Apparheid years. This is really very very sad...J. Stuart"
1,Twisted History,"If you appreciate history you won't like this book. It doesn't say that in 1974, after the invasion, all the names of ancient cities, villages, and sites where changed. It glosses over the fact that the demographics of the area where forcibly changed - ethnic cleansing. It also doesn't tell you that a hotel you may stay at is disputed property, many of which are converted monastaries and are the focal point of protests by religious organizations around the world."
1,NEVER AGAIN...,"I made the mistake of visiting this place once. It all looks pretty brilliant in the book... but once one gets there it's all pure nonsense. This is by far the most corrupted place on earth. If getting into trouble all the time and paying officials pribes to be able to even finish your holidays, is your favourite art of vacations... Bon Voyage! If not... then simply forget it!"
3,"Enjoyable memories, but Lacks the Sizzle of Liar's Club","Mary Karr's second autobiography brought back many memories of growing up. I especially enjoyed the earlier part of the book, where she relates her relationship with the neighbor-boy she had a crush on, and the joys, pains and nuances of adolescent girl friendships.The latter part of the book, with the drugged-out hazes and strange look-what-the-cat-dragged-in friends, I just could not relate to. One is not sure what it is all supposed to mean, if anything, or what Mary herself makes of her teen rebelliousness.Still I enjoyed the book and her lyrical language, and I look forward to more from her."
5,Great story-telling! I saw myself in her!,"If you have read Liar's Club, then you will love this book! I honestly felt that Cherry was better that the first book, but I know that I wouldn't have enjoyed it if I hadn't read Liar's Club first. Liar's club gave a deep background into her relationships with her family members which is necessary to understand the interactions between all of them during her teenage years. It plays on so many themes, like sister relationships, mother-daughter relationships, father-daughter relationships, and most importantly, relationships with other teenage girls and boys. I found myself rooting for her, crying for her, and feeling the pandora's box open as she begins to realize the truths about herself and all of those she loves. And the funny thing is that the story is told in a very casual yet hilarious manner. I was always anxious to find out what happened next!"
1,Big Disappointment,"What a let down. As others have stated, boring, dull,leaving me with a ""So What? feeling"" I thoroughly enjoyed The Liar's Club and was very anxious to read Cherry, but found myself either wanting it to end or at least take the story somewhere, anywhere! I ended up not finishing the book, opting for paying more attention to parts of life that truly matter. Very little focus and point to the anecdotes, almost as if this were a random and confused self serving stream of consciousness .... am now skeptical about Lit and doubt I will order it."
1,Cherry flops,"One of the disturbing trends in today's world is the willingness of people to bare their souls to the public. Ms. Karr apparently feels obligated to add her sad-sap story to this annoying public discourse. While Liar's Club was acceptable in that childhood bears airing-out every once in awhile, Cherry is nothing more than a cheap attempt to score a couple of bucks.Many if not all American adults at one time in their lives go through a period of indiscretion, often sexually and with drugs and alcohol. We really don't need page after page of Mary Karr's sexual experiences and constant need to get high. The ego of this woman is almost unbelieveable. We all had our teenage years...Ms. Karr's experiences are of little interest to anyone, except perhaps a judge due to her rampant lawlessness in terms of substance use.The content of Cherry is better suited to form the content of a dialogue with a psychiatrist...the author is in obvious and immediate need of therapy."
1,J-U-N-K!,This piece of junk has been giving me nothing but heartaches since I bought it last spring. The shelves in the doors are absolute junk and my dvd's continuously fall to the floor in a heap. The cardboard shelves inside are only half as deep as they should be so the whole thing tips forward until you balance it just right. Don't waste your money on this product. I wish I could get my money back!
5,Excellent Book,"-The full, authoritative history of Purdeys, with serial numbers, production and sales figures, diagrams of patents and pictures of guns/factory (past and today).Donald Dallas is also correcting some incorrect information that for years were treated as facts by other gun writers, you can feel the huge effort he put into this book.The finest book I've ever read."
1,TERRIBLE Music - and it's free with the game anyway!,"Okay, so why would you buy the weakest radio station in the game, when you get it when you buy the game anyway???If I want to listen to Espantoso, I could just put on my PC, hop in a car and flick it on. OR, I could extract the MP3 file which I bought when I bought the PC game and put it onto a CD.It's called FAIR USE, people. Get on the bandwagon. You already own the music - all of it, including the one good track (which is omitted here), and you paid for it."
3,"Nice music, but not the best album","It's a good choice specially if you want to listen a kind of different music. Zeca baleiro always try to do something diferent in each CD. He can visits many kinds of rythms, or simply use marvellous guitars chords. But this time, he got into the drum'n'bass, and starts to really explorer the electronic sound beat. Ok! He can do it but the result is not on the top. There are sometimes of pure magic. In fact I really liked the music Drumembeis, where he works the drum'n'bass mixed with a brazilian kind of song know as ""embolada"". If a reader of this review have been in the northeast region of Brazil, he knows what I'm talking about.If you like Zeca, you must have this album, but don't expect the same guy writin' songs. If you don't know his work, maybe..."
3,wasn't as good as I wished it was,"If U loved Blue horse as well as we did here playing it non stop til you knew even the slurry words by heart, you;d naturally want this new CD as we did too. I can't listen to it.It nothing like BLue horse. There may be one or two songs worth buying it for but the rest will drone on without meaning and inspiration for you too perhaps.I dont' use it. that says everything. I may in fact have forced myself to play it full through once and leave it now to gather dust. The JUnkie song is OK but the ladies added something here that was too dark and confusing without the same SOUL in Blue Horse. I love these girls... but..... maybe wait for the next one?"
4,The Tanyas Are Good,"The Be Good Tanyas's album ""Chinatown"" includes tough accoustic versions of traditional blues and folk songs as well as some of their own material. The sound is stripped down and spare, with often a banjo being the only musical accompanyment to the three members vocals. The highlights of the disc are the opening ""It's Not Happening,"" ""In Spite of All the Damage,"" ""Ship Out on the Sea"" and Horses."" There are also a couple of hidden tracks that appear after the last song ahas ended. On the downside, the album is a tad overlong, featuring a few numbers, like the surprisingly unengaging cover of ""House of the Rising Sun,"" that don't work as well.Overall, a solid sphomore effort from a trio of fine Canadian roots rockers."
2,muddy sound,"The sound of Chinatown, by The Be Good Tanyas, was muddy and overall the album was disappointing."
5,Excellent CD!!!,"Got a copy of ""Hard To Believe"" after some friends and I saw Rob Anthony at a concert. Unbelievable!!! That's all I and my friends have to say. Hope to see the band when there on tour through here again. My favorite songs are ""More Than A Friend"" and ""Hard To Believe"". Thanks for the great music."
4,Very pleased with the quality and function,"I bought it as a ""play and charge"" since the default PS3 mini usb cable is so short. The velcro wrap and the textured cover of the cable were very welcome ""features"" for $7 it's a little pricey but nice to have."
3,Quit after 1.5 years,"The cord that came with my PS3 was so short that I couldn't play while it was plugged in and charging. This seemed like a nice fix - and it was, until it just stopped charging. At first, as long as I could hold it at the right angle, it was fine, but that didn't last long. It was only a few bucks when I bought it, so I don't regret the purchase, but this isn't made to last."
3,Longer... just longer,"You get a 'longer' USB cable. It can be useful when your Sixaxis needs a charge and you want to keep playing while it's charging - something that's not happening very often. Since I didn't have to pay for it (I got the 'pair' bundle), I don't mind them being around but their utility is marginal for anyone but a hardcore gamer who does not keep a spare, charged Sixaxis."
1,Doesn't Work Well,"I used them for the first time today. The return spring doesn't work properly, it only opens up half way after each clip. Will return them"
3,I prune a lot,I am overall happy with these pruners. They do a satisfactory job without a lot of effort. What I don't like is the grip coming off the handle every 2-3 cuts. Annoying having to push it back on all day long.
5,Pruners,These pruners are super. I had my last one for 10 years & they needed to be replaced. I do a lot of gardening & you can't go wrong with these.
1,Dry and Difficult,"Not enough action, to much research. To heavy in art history and not enough material a child can expect to find in a 5th grade classroom. Our son gets too bored because the navigation is to difficult."
2,Tedious Reading,"A scathing account of one member of law enforcement, and how fellow officers looked the other way. A very sad commentary on American law and order. That said, I did find the book rather boring and couldn't connect with any of these people. I skipped to the end chapter midway through the book."
5,"Yet another ""What Color Is Your Parachute""??","Dilip Saraf's very first book is awesome. After running two successful startups -- one each in Chip Design and Biotech -- I was wondering which way to go. A fellow entrepreneur friend suggested I at least browse through the 7 Keys. I wondered: Oh no! Yet another ""What Color Is Your Parachute?""Once I began browsing, I ended up reading most of it in two days. I found the book refreshingly objective, down-to-earth, and specific.Followup interactions with Dilip yielded extraordinary results bymaking me re-think the meaning of life itself -- which then helped me define my career goals.This book is a wonderful contribution which, I hope, will help many more of us in gracefully navigating through turbulent mid-career waters amidst a rapidly changing world."
2,A big disappointment,"We have always enjoyed movies with Sam Elliott, but this one was a big disappointment, not up to his usual standards."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed that this film did not offer detail on the colorful history of this famous lawman. It seemed the movie just began before he is killed. Bill Tighlman's past is much more interesting than his death.
5,Excellent Product,"Recently had surgery on my chin and this product not only helped the healing of the incisions, but they are basically invisible to the eye."
3,Mediocre translation,"People who did not grow up in a muslim environment will find a large quantity of Qur'anic material--whether in the original Ancient Arabic or in modern-language translation--that is objectionable from a theological and/or moral point of view. Nevertheless, students of comparative religions may wish to consult this translation in order to compare with other English-language translations.Better translations are:1) M.A.S. Abdel Haleem (Oxford University Press)2) N.J. Dawood (Penguin Classics)"
5,Great item,"My husband bought this to work-out with. He's 6'5"" and the other ones weren't tall enough for him. This works great"
5,raw kinetic surreal and enlighting,"I personally feel that this album is brilliant. Saul is a rare and important voice that is needed in these times. I Found It To Be A Breath Of Fresh Air. From the first listen my jaw hit the floor. I Love Amethist Rockstar, But I Feel That This Album Shows Saul taking A Much More Song-Structred Approach To His Writing, Where With Amethist It was More Rhythmic Poetry. If you're intrested in unique and poetically progressive music that has a significant political and spiritual message than check this out. plus if you miss rage against the machine check out track 4 for a zack de la rocha appearance plus some other nice guests."
2,Kelsys Backpack Chair,"This is a good size for outdoor concerts that do not allow chairs more than 4 inches off the ground. Design could use improvement as the manufacturer has obviously never taken it to a concert. The ""cup holder"" in only one arm is shallow and will not reliably hold a bottle of beer or pop without spilling when you move around. The cup holder is also small in diameter and will not take most sports drink or water bottles that have quick closer tops. Way too heavy for any mountain overnight backpacking but a nice weight for other uses such as concerts."
5,End of perfect chair search,Though designed for the beach this chair finally fulfills my need for a chair that can be easily carried on rough terrain or for distances of several miles. The easy conversion form chair to mini backpack even allows you to carry a light lunch and stove with no second pack. Add the sun shade and even open areas on hot sunny days are comfortable.
4,Great '80s songs!,"This is a great compilation of '80s ""theme songs""! However, I cannot believe they forgot the ""Come on Feel the Noise"" by Twisted Sister! That is one of the trademark '80s songs! That's why it's a 4 star instead of a 5 star. Great otherwise."
5,Listen Up Metalheads!,"This soundtrack (Volume 1) to the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City has many classic 80's metal tracks from the best artists.

4,Worth Borrowing,"This is a pretty good overview of the 80's rock scene. Missing some good stuff, and dude? QUIET RIOT SANG ""Come on feel the noise""! Dee Snider couldnt make that up. But if you liked the games sound track, this is worth getting. My favorite station from the game,"
5,I am so glad that I found this television series,"I love British sitcoms but have already seen all of Are You Being Served?, Fawlty Towers, The Good Life (Good Neighbors), Keeping Up Appearances, As Time Goes By, and others. I was looking for something new and found it in this series, Allo Allo! The totally hilarious situations that keep happening to Rene and his confederates as well as his enemies(?) are well worth watching. Cast changes are handled really well so you aren't left wondering ""What happened?"". I can't wait to get the next installment (Series 9).Series 8 with its story lines of Michelle's pregnancy, Gruber's compromising photo, and the number of Hitler and Goering's running around was just as funny and captivating as the first 7 series. But the war is almost over for Rene and the cast of Allo Allo! How it will all come to a close will keep me on the edge of my seat until October when I get the next DVD."
2,Deep surprise,"I'm pretty selective in my music purchases. I try to listen to samples. I read reviews. I follow bands I know well and have deep apreciations for. All that being said this cd is a huge disappointment AND I feel deeply mislead by Amazon with these particular reviews. What are you trying to do? Move some product? Your rating system and selected reviews have me quite leery now. Believe me, before I purchase anything else from you I will do A LOT more research. Amazon....I don't trust you anymore."
5,Best Shoe Ever!,My wife searched everywhere for a shoe she could wear without pain! This is the best ever. Great support. Wider heel for balance. Recommend it highly.
5,Excellent book.,Excellent book. The author provides a vivid picture of this historical time period and the characters involved accurate description of historical information
3,Too lean!!,"I thought that Time and Chance was bit lean in characterization. It was not as complete or good as As Christ and His Saints Slept and this is probably because the first book centered around Matilda while the second book really don't have a real center. I thought Time and Chance was perhaps too short of a book and more pages could have been given to dig deeper with Thomas Becket or any other characters who looked like they needed more fleshing out. I thought Eleanor have gotten a short end of the stick which is kind of funny since Penman wrote her pretty well in her shorter mystery novels. I hope this will be just the weak link of the trilogy since I am looking forward to the third book, perhap realizing that it cannot be as bad as the second."
2,Disappointing,"I really enjoyed Sharon Kay Penman's earlier books, and I was excited about this one.The beginning was fairly entertaining, although I knew too much about Henry and Eleanor for it to seem as fascinating as some of Penman's earlier books. Still, I enjoyed some of those bits.Unfortunately, about three quarters of the way through, I was starting to hope Becket would just die already! Each political move among Becket, Henry and the Pope seems to be described in minute but somehow uncompelling detail. I honestly found that rather than wanting to stay up late to read (which is usually the case with Penman's books), I'd drop off in mid-paragraph. It was really a struggle to finish.Overall, not one of the best books about this era and a real letdown."
3,Too long!,"This started so well... I really cared about Henry and Eleanor, and Ranulf... but strings are left hanging in the air, and the whole thing gets bogged down with the Earl of this and the Bishop of that...."
2,A Definite Let Down,"I absolutely agree with the reviewer of March 12, from Alexandria, Va. This sequel to ""When Christ and His Saints Slept"" was quite a disappointment. After waiting for five years for the sequel, ""Time and Chance"" was not at all what had been expected. The characters were two-dimensional; no depth whatsoever. Although the book was read from cover to cover, the anticipation was dissolved within the first chapter. All the other historical novels by Ms. Penman are such classics- this story of Henry II and Eleanor was 'blah'. Hate to say it, but chances are I won't read the third book in the triology. Too bad the generous writing of her Welsh series wasn't continued."
1,Not a sunne in splendour,"This sequel to the saga of the early English kingdom is a disapointing effort to recreate the excellent and precise descriptions of people and country of previous novels.One can only assume that writing superficial, light mystery novels has not been productive for the authors narrative: the preference for short, swift dialogue has not done any good. We are deprived in this case of the rich insights into events and personal thoughts.Perlman has lost ground in the realm of historical novelists. I fear she will have to regain quite a few followers after this disapointing effort."
4,Spiritual growth,"I love books , specially journals.this 60days devotional journal need to be shared with friends.I always wanted to share stories but always studied alone.Like other spiritual books, this book will be one of myspitual source."
5,Nunca habia escuchado a Mecano hasta este disco...,"Despues de escuchar este album me pregunté: ""Como es posible que halla vivido toda mi vida sin comprar musica de este grupo"". Lo compre recientemente y ya quiero tener toda la colección de ellos aunque es una pena que se halla separado el grupo. Su musica es magica (Hermano sol hermana luna), llena de inspiracion (Dalai Lama), frescura juvenil (Me colé en una fiesta), sincera (Cuerpo y corazon), intelectual (Dali), divertida (Maquillaje), y romantica (Me cuesta tanto olvidarte)...Canciones que presentan temas sociales como la prostitución (Cuerpo y corazon), homosexualidad (stereosexual), drogadiccion (Aire), etc...genial! Definitivamente no existe un grupo en ingles que sea equivalente a este...Este grupo me hace sentir orgulloso de ser hispano. Ninguno es ni será igual! Gracias Ana, Nacho Y José."
1,Poor Customer Service At This Store,"The product would have been great, but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes. I requested XL Long pants. They sent size 3X pants. So they are completely unusable, and do not respond to my emails. I would never order from them again."
2,Not worth it. Get an umbrella.,"A shoddy design. A good concept, but I found it cumbersome and poorly designed. While it does give you good shade, it is poorly constructed and tears with ease. The velcro attachments need to be reinforced. Any wind will easily tear the anchor points."
2,The Perfect Disc for Insomniacs,"If this one doesn't put you to sleep, nothing will. For a better example of `Face at his best, check out 1989's ""Tender Lover."""
3,For people who are just getting into the band,"This is a hits compilation for beginners. While it does have some great songs, it does have a considerable series of flaws:1. There are no songs with original lead vocalist Paul Di'Anno, so that means no ""Iron Maiden,"" ""Phantom Of The Opera,"" ""Running Free,"" ""Wrathchild,"" or ""Purgatory,"" to name a few.2. It does not have enough of their best songs, such as ""Hallowed Be Thy Name,"" ""Aces High,"" and ""Stranger In A Strange Land.""3. It has two songs from No Prayer For The Dying, the worst album of the Bruce Dickinson era. At least they are the only remotely good songs from that album (""Holy Smoke"" and ""Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter."")4. It features music from the Blaze Bayley era, Iron Maiden's weakest era of all.Overall, this is a good compilation if you are completely new to the band, but if you have any of their albums, don't bother."
2,A Real Dud Dne.,"Unless you are a collector there is no reason to buy this.You will be much happier with ED Hunter; which comes with a pretty good game as well. I have every american released CD from Maiden, which includes earlier compilations. But I probably will wait untill this one's on sale to buy it just to have it. The Brave New World album was great. Something along this standard should have been released instead. Up the Irons!"
3,"So, so.","I purchased this DVD with great expectations. I love to watch dances, especially the ones choregraphed by Jilian, performed by NDT in particular. However, this DVD was a bit disappointing. I think the director was trying to do *too much*. There are way too frequent special effects and camera view point changes, which actually ruins the *essence* of dance, in my humble opinion. It wasn't bad, but just not as exciting as the other Jilian DVDs I purchased.."
5,This book has both practical instruction and inspiring style,"This book, by deceased illustrator Willy Pogany, is, along with Jack Hamm's book, the best one on drawing the human head and figure. The book covers perspective, shape, and figure drawing in step-by-step practical fashion. Also included is an inspiring section of Pogany's own sketches of fanciful worlds and creatures. This book makes you want to practice and practice the steps, so that you too can create your own lively characters and scenes."
5,mind opening,This book is one of the more profound. It is the final days of the Maharaj's life. He is a bit more testy and does not hold the readers hand. You must have some insights into the waking and dreaming states of man to get this.
2,"Disappointed, 2","I, too, found the book tedious. The characters are largely caricatures and the situations contrived. I didn't care about any of the prinicpals because none of them seemed like real people me. The book seemed more like an exercise in multicultural writing--stuff in as many ethnic groups and religions as possible--than a well-thought-out novel. I've nothing against multiculturalism, but I'll stick to Bharati Mukherjee, Rohinton Mistry and Maxine Hong Kingston in the future."
5,Upbuilding Work,Just the song: 'Don't stop at the top' by itself is enough as far as getting a song full of encouragement for things going on on one's life. 'We let it rock you let it roll' is a great song full of energy that summarizes the scorpions approach and attitude of pure passion for great rock in fellowship with their fans around the globe.
2,Gahhhhkk!!!!!,"The album isn't THAT horrible, but to me it is a shame that here is this great band that's been making all the deepest stuff over here and the rockinist stuff over there finally has everybody's attention and they turn out a platter that is such a blatent reflection of the commercial climate of the day. I like to watch the video for ""When Passion Rules the Game"" for yuks, but when it comes to the video ""from Russia with Love and other Savage Amusements"".... that's when I feel sad. Great band pushing these god awful hair metal ballads that have absolutely no artistic value. If you disagree with me consult exibit A. the videos."
5,"Funny, sexy read!","Sophie Addison is suffering amnesia after an incident at a gas station. She thinks she is a Vegas Showgirl! She storms into Tranquility, Texas and turns the town upside-down! Including Gray McBride's life, goals and libido. Gray is a sexy, hunky cowboy that wants to become mayor to help his family. But he did not factor in the impact that ""Sunny"" haves on the town folks and him. Dianne Castell weaves a sexy, funny & heartwarming story that will have you saying"" yeehaa"". Great storyline and characters makes this one more of her share of great books.! Pick it up and have a happy reading!"
5,"No doubt, the Project at their best","The Project delivers in their first album the best of them. It's not only that they didn't reach this level very often, but they did some totally awful albums. I think this record fits perfect to a trilogy with ""Eve"" and ""Turn of a friendly card"". Definitely not like terrifying ""I Robot"", ""Pyramid"" or ""Vulture Culture"" (even ""Eye In The Sky"" gets boring at certain points).I think the songs are much better than the instrumental suite, though it has several very high points. Best songs may be ""The Raven"" and ""The Cask Of Amontillado"". But there is a boring song, ""To One In Paradise"" (thay may announce what will come later, there is always a boring song: ""You Won't Be There"", ""Time""...)The whole record becomes a must-have if you like Poe's writings.I wish Alan Parsons did a 2nd volume."
4,First album in years!,"Hell ya! One of the most overlooked bands of the 80's and 90's is back with their first album in 7 years. The Weddoes have returned with a good one as well. Older fans take note. There isn't much new sound here, but it does sound like a Wedding Present album. Hell, this band influenced Nirvana. If you are a newer fan, go buy Watusi and Seamonters as well."
5,Absolute Cape Jazz Bliss,"Once again Hugh releases another timeless piece. The selection of tracks is superb, and each song brings about a different musical sensation. After sampling only one track, you will feel guilty for pausing or fast-forwarding any of them because each track builds in intensity. The clarity of the music is sublime, and Hugh merges his usual Township signiture with contemporary sound very well, thus appealing to traditional and new fans. A fantastic musical investment. There are not enough stars to rate this product!"
1,Stick to the book and don't bother with this one...,"What is the point of the ""video of the book"" if all it does is repeat the pictures in the book? What passes as animation here is practically non existent -- a slow succession of static images in which only the occasional detail is animated (and only in the most basic of fashions at that). John Cleese's narration is fine, but the rest is inexcusably cheap and pointless."
5,Excellent! :),"Songs like ""Exactly Like You"" and ""I Wonder"" are gems. This is good slow dancing in the kitchen music for couples from their 30's to their 90's. KD Lang is quite a genius and when her sound combines with Tony, there is a sort of magic synergy that occurs. You have got to hear this CD!!"
3,Very Pleasant Duo / Bennett and Lang,"Is this the Tony Bennett of the past; of course not! Yet, he teams up with K.D. Lang in what I would call a ""most"" pleasant CD! His voice is certainly not the voice of Bennett when he sang such songs as Because of You, Stranger in Paridise, I left My Heart In San Francisco, or even, When Joanna Loves Me. Yet, this is a very good CD and I am enjoying it very much; Bennett is being smart in teaming up with other artists at this stage of his career! I definitely recomment this CD even through his voice is not of the Tony Bennett of the past!"
2,Not at all as expected,"This is not a CD I would have purchased, but received it as a gift. However, I do really like both performers and so was interested and fully expecting to enjoy their duets. Imagine my surpise when it turned out that they only sing together on one song ~ La Vie En Rose. All the others are not duets at all, but merely sung alternately. I found this very disappointing. They are shown singing together and in the studio together, but could really have done the whole thing from opposite sides of the country. Won't be listening to it often. I'd stronly suggest you spend the money on solo albums instead."
3,Lacks punch,"I am a huge Bennett fan and have enjoyed this cd (although K.D. Lang?s voice doesn?t impress me that much.) That said, someone recently loaned me the cd of Louis Armstrong singing the same songs and it had a totally different feel. Truly Armstrong is inimitable. His versions are full of pizzazz, mischievousness and just plain fun. I?m sorry to say that after hearing the originals I found the Bennett/Lang rather mediocre."
1,I beg to differ...,"Well, I certainly am in the minority, but then again I have high standards with respect to such enormously talented individuals as Tony and K.D. They, as well as Louis Armstrong, whose music was to be celebrated on this album, have been done a disservice here. The orchestration is languorous to the point of being soporific. There isn't a trumpet to be heard (roll over, Satchmo!), and not one song conveys the rollicking spirit of the man who to whom they are paying tribute. K.D.'s voice is so rich and multilayered, but Tony's has begun to suffer from the changes in timbre that come with age. More artful production values characteristic of someone like Quincy Jones would have enabled a more elegant meshing of these veteran voices, with richer arrangements. Sorry for you diehard fans, but these two deserved something better than the flat landscape of this production."
2,k.d. lang could manage this one on her own!!,"I finally got the album today and I wasn't really in too big of a hurry to get it - unlike any other time k.d. lang puts out a solo album and I'm buying it the day it comes out. I have to say that this is also an album my mother will love as a Xmas present - since she loves BOTH Tony Bennett and k.d. and really enjoyed the show I took her to last year. All I can say about this album, is that it's torture to sit there and have to listen to Tony sing with kd - when I want so much for it to be ONLY kd singing these songs. I love these old standards and Ella Fitzgerald is also one of my favorite singers and she's done all of these songs on her various solo albums. k.d. would have done the songs a greater justice doing them all solo, rather than ""helping"" Tony out to sell yet another album for him."
2,Good lens quality -- fragile earpieces.,"As an owner of 6 or 7 pair of Polar Optics / Solar Shield sunglasses, I've experienced most every problem this brand is capable of having. The lens quality is excellent, but earpieces are very fragile. So why continue to pay 20 bucks each for so many pair? Well, until about two years ago, warranty was great. A simple email was all it took to get an exchange pair, no matter what the problem. Then the emails went unanswered -- maybe they changed ownership, or fired the ""good"" warranty lady. So I tried the new customer service contact info. Oh sure, no problem, just send them in prepaid -- with proof of purchase -- oh yeah and be sure to include $5 or so for ""handling"". The old lifetime guarantee is now a year -- and for sure, the earpieces will be shot before the warranty expires.Solar Shield Polarized Glasses"
2,Why do people buy these type of books,"It's always been a bit of a mystery as to why people buy this type of book (I received mine as a gift). The 201 Best Things Ever Said purports to be just that, a compendium of clever, witty and useful quotes. It takes about 5 minutes to ""read"" this book, and I found that once I glanced through it once or twice, I never looked at it again.The quotes aren't organized in any particular way and there's no index, so if you're looking for a quote on a particular subject, good luck finding it. Furthermore, many of the quotes really aren't that interesting (and certainly aren't the best things ever said) and many were said by people I have never heard of. I also find it hard to believe that Lily Tomlin has 3 or 4 of the greatest quotes in the history of mankind.I think you have to be a real quote lover to buy this book. People looking for a useful book of quotes should try and find a book with an index and quotes organized by subject/theme."
5,He is back and Livin large energon style.,"Transformers Energon Omega Supreme is an excellent figure for both collectors and kids although admittedly the price it sells for now will likely scare off parents looking to buy for kids as will his being not of the current series.The battleship is by far the better of the two vehicle modes and it contains the sound and lights feature for the figure and it is not intrusive at all and does not affect the transformation.The construction Crane is less fun but still interesting. The two vehicles can be linked to form one massive super space train.The head of Omega supreme is for all practical purposes a headmaster.The Full on robot mode is massive and is as larger and bulk as you could want for Omega supreme and the head nicely homage's the G1 figure's head.in conclusion if you like Transformers, Big Robots this is the figure for you."
5,A life changing book!,"I am a voracious and eager reader. I read this book once, I re-read it and re-read it again. I can honestly say the content of this book set me on a life changing path. I resonated with so many things Bruce wrote about. One of the most important gifts I gave myself after reading this book was to book a complimentary coaching call with the author himself. He was friendly, enthusiastic and helpful with any points in the book which I needed further clarification on. I then booked him as my coach for some months. He helped me through an extremely difficult period in my life and I refer to his book as my down to earth bible because it is! Anyone looking for help with the constant ups and downs of life and wondering why they happen will find this book invaluable as well as plenty of tools to help you create a life full of passion and a life you love. Read it and keep this book close it is a little gem."
1,Not happy!,"I would advise against using these swabs. Use an air blower and if that fails then take it to a professional. I used all four and managed to leave marks on the sensor. Not happy, need to send the camera in. Also they are extremely overpriced."
5,A Keeper,"The service was prompt, the book was in excellent shape. I would definitely order here again. All in all, very pleased with this transaction!Michael W. Young's biography (2004)of Bronislaw Malinowski, with the Malinowski family's blessing and support, documents the anthropologist's personal and professional journey through life. Young's writing style positions, with a seemingly intended purpose, the reader in a distant, objective armchair pose while detailing the aspects of Malinowski's life. Considering the access Young had,the biography appears well-researched, and was fascinating to explore."
4,Not for everyone,"A very good book, but not for everyone. If you are looking for light reading for a Sunday afternoon, then look elsewhere. This book is almost academic. One of the best when comes to studying the correlation between magic science and religion."
4,great movie,this is a good movie-straight and to the point-i would recommend this movie. this was a very exciting movie with lots of violence
5,The best ever,"The allman brothers could do it all; Two of the best guitarist in the business, two drummers, great bass and piano.It does not get any better than this."
2,Gave some bad Advice,"The book gives good advice on how to wash and condition you hair properly to prevent breakage, but the author advises the readers to get braided extensions to give the hair a rest for the time between your relaxers. I followed her directions with getting and removing the braids and applying a braid mist but experienced extreme breakage, I ended up worst then where I started.Also if you follow her plan be prepared to spend some money."
2,Not for everyone,This book focused more on people with relaxed hair. The book tended to be repetitive and didn't tell me much of anything I didn't already know.
1,Poor,I am very disappointed. I could not get good reception in my area. I was trying this product and intended to use it as a Christmas gift for someone who wanted a transitor radio! I want my money back~
4,Good for in bright outdoors,This is good for blocking the sun and helping see the LCD. I have a fold-out LCD and have to remove the Hoodman any time I put the camera away. Otherwise it works great.
3,There's another book that covers this topic! Get it as well!,"It is Dr Joel Hayward's critically praised book called ""Stopped at Stalingrad"". As a reviewer below notes, Hayward's book has almost 90 pages that analyse the German assault and the Soviet defence of Sevastapol at length, utilising a commendable array of previously unknown primary sources and providing a thorough and insightful analysis. Hayward's book deals with air, sea and land operations in and around Sevastopol, and is almost faultless. It is a very strong book, not like this far weaker work."
5,Best BL Season ever,Season 7 is the best Biggest Loser season. The contestants of this show are so much more interesting than the other three seasons I've seen. After seeing this I bought season 8 but never cared much about the people so it wasn't nearly as fun to watch. But season 7 is great entertainment and great weight loss motivation too.
3,Cover King Floor mats for '05 Toyota Camray,"Coverking CFMAM12TT9041 Front Custom Fit Floormat for Toyota Camry 5th Genration - Nylon Carpet, BeigeThe quality of the product is fine. The promised custom design while acceptable was a long way from the original concept. It was a tad disappointing."
4,"Bee Gees, Bee Gees","While the quality of Bee Gees music slowly declined over the years, their worst was always better than most of others' ""best."" The hallmark of all Bee Gees songs are the tremendously tight vocals: great harmonies, beautiful voices. Anyone who does not own all Bee Gees music is deprived of an important part of the music of our lives."
5,One of a kind,"This often overlooked and under appreciated album is really interesting, but not in a way usually associated with the often awe inspiring bee gees. Maybe it came out this way because the boys were a little ragged from being legends and touring the world with their encyclopedia of hits. Of course the first cut is one for the best of comp, but as the album continues you hear something that has all the ingredients of good bee gees music..... but something is shall we say a little... off kilter. This is best showcased in ""Paper Mache"", which is an absolutely hilarious experience to listen too. I go nuts when I hear this song. I won't even try to explain it. They knew they were missing the target here, but still it got put out and it's actually quite ""special"" in it's own right. Not for anyone who is not a fan already though. Lets just say they'll ""miss the point""."
4,"Historically accurate, for the most part.","Historically accurate, for the most part.For once a Civil War movie that does not vilify the South. These were brave men, pioneers in naval warfare defending their homeland. Must see for Civil War Buffs,"
2,Good Tracks Are So Hard To Find (On this CD),"Aside from ""Summertime Blues"" I found the rest of the tracks on this CD very forgettable and some were just plain annoying. The great majority of these songs seemed to be simply filler. Very disappointing. If anyone deserve the title of ""one hit wonder"", Blue Cheer takes the prize."
1,"Poor Quality, Too Simplistic","This low-budget, low-quality DVD was too simplistic to be useful for a serious runner who has any background in yoga whatsoever.Much of it was breathing exercises, cat-cow, and other very basic yoga poses. Little of it seemed tailored to runners.I was hoping for something that would discuss which muscles get overly tight from running and which are underdeveloped--and offer yoga poses to counteract these trends. That is, poses that stretch what gets tight and strengthen muscles that aren't used much in running, to restore balance and decrease risk of injury. But the DVD never quite got there.In addition, I was hoping the DVD would include some serious attention to the core, because strengthening the core can improve running and decrease injuries. But this never happened.Overall, a disappointment and a waste of money. Better off perusing back issues of Runner's World for ideas, which is pretty easy to do at most public libraries."
4,Showcases Chris's playing and writing,"While Damned the machine is a great album, Metalopolis is the true showcase of Poland's versatility and indistinguishable soloing. This album still holds up to this day."
5,Nothing quite like it.,"I first heard of this album while reading ""the collector's guide to heavy metal"" by martin popoff, A book of metal albums in which martin gives his opinion and rates them from one to ten. Martin said this album was boring and only gave it a five. Being the Megadeth fan that I am I ordered it off of amazon. After listening to it I have to say that martin popoff can shove his book right up his ass. This cd is so unique. Its like metal with a touch of jazz and newage. Though it is metal, I have found that return to metalopolis is great to listen to chill out and even relax you to fall asleep at night. The songs are so catchy and the licks are so pleasing to the ear. I havnt heard anything off of chris poland's chasing the sun yet but if its anything like return to metalopolis, im definatly getting it."
1,New models incompatible with Xlink Kai,"Unlike the original model, the new revision of the Wifi Max is incompatible with Xlink Kai, a program that allows you to play Ad Hoc PSP games over the internet."
5,Excelent.,Este chamo canta muy bien. Es el único que me gusta. Recomiendo mucho su nuevo disco índigo.
4,octopus..... far-out man,"if you like late 60's pop-psych music this is a treat. a little pricey but with all the extra songs it's like 2 cd's in one. the cover is so awesome. if you like this,try[the pretty things]. another awesome over looked late 60's english group. peace/bush hog"
5,"Entertaining, VERY Helpful....","I had this game years ago, around the late 90s. It was so much fun. I'm about to explode trying to tell the Amazon crowd about it. What can I say? I had trouble with Math. Using this helped to strengthen my ability to use quick, mental Math. It was a great way to spend my weekends. The games made it so much fun. The problems with adding up food tabs, adding weight, etc., they come in handy. So when someone goes shopping, they can round up and pretty much get a close estimate of how much they owe. it covers everything from Area, Gas budget, decimals, division, and a a pie chart section too. I wish I could get another copy to work with Vista. I sadly lost my only copy years ago and am not sure if it will work on this computer. But if you have an old computer (Like Windows 2000 and under), give it a try. This is a staple game for anyone with Jr. High-aged children who need help in their studies. It's a good head-start over the Summer!"
3,"A little boring, but you learn","this game was very confusing when i first installed it, but after about five minutes i figured out how to play it. it's a good game but it gets boring after 30 minute periods. There are parts that i don't understand how they have to do with math at all, but all in all a good game, i would recomend it for fourth and fifth graders, possibly third graders who are learning decimals, or sixth graders who are reviewing concepts."
3,"Music CD, Totally Country Vol.2",Most of the reviews I seem was very high. But to me its just an average CD with a wide range of Country songs.
5,VERY good case,this is a very nice case the protects the iPod very well. It seals the iPod well so no dirt can get in it. the thing thats annoying is it's silicone so it will pick dirt all the time. the assembly can be tough but it is well worth it. I definitely recommend this product! Very good for the price!
5,will buy on amazon again,This was a gift to my daughter for her 18th birthday with the creme brulee ramkin set and the torch. she just loves it since she loves creme brulee and can now make it herself.
4,Satisfied thus far..but..,"I purchased this machine cause at the time I could not afford a Kitchen Aid. This machine is ideal for mixing frosting made with vegetable shortening as this can become stiff and put strain on your regular mixer motor (I can testify I lost two hand mixers). The other attachments has proven to be useful as well, I used the dough hook to make fondant and was satisfied with the results. I appreciate the fact the mixer is quiet and I mean quiet it does not disturb anyone while I work, clean up is easy as well. The thing that dissapointed me with this product is that it does not have any further attachments,eg. pasta machine etc. But overall I would recommend this product."
1,Didn't Even Work The First Time!,"I purchased this as a gift for my daughter's birthday which happens to be a few days before Christmas. She attempted to make a pound cake on Christmas Eve and the attachment wouldn't even turn! Needless to say, she had to complete the dessert using a 20-yr old, $10 hand mixer. The hand mixer was 10 times less than the Eclectrics mixer. Don't waste your money or time!"
2,No so great,"Lot's of balls, but not very bouncy.These are not balls that didn't quite make the 3 star cut, but balls that were probably destined to be shot out of kid's toys and it shows."
5,Kona Coast,"Excellent movie,Richard Boone part was excellent. I loved the story line and the only thing that didn't care for was the age of the young women. The 20 year old were great in Paladin but at 50 years old they just didn't look right."
1,You would have to be an idiot to...,"buy this product. Not only is it almost $200 over list price.... it's almost the same price as a 42"" LG. A dvd player will run you about $50 if you look around for one. Anyone spending $700 on a 19"" tv should have their head examined. Rule of thumb... if you are looking for a tv (or anything for that matter)... start with your price range first!"
2,negative,"This book is not factual! I really cannot handle people who write books about places they have only visited and do not know the reality of the area. Stock dogs are not ""shelties"" and in Wyoming you do not hear thunder in a snowstorm in October! This book has a good plot but PLEASE, let's stick to the facts. I'm from Montana so I am familiar with Wyoming ranches, weather, etc."
4,Good songs,"A pretty good alternative album. The songs are catchy and melodic, and some songs have a habit of playing over and over in your brain. ""Lump"" for instance, also ""Peaches"", both radio hits for these guys. Using unusual 'guitars', the two-string basitar and the three-string guitbass (never heard of them before) plus drums, the music is not all-overpowering. I'm not one for swear words in songs, and could do without it in ""Kitty"", which is why I give the album 4 stars and not 5. But apart from that, it's really good."
2,I wanted to skream!,I was surprized at how much I hated the ending! I wouln't give the details but it was gory and sad noting good happend for Eragon. All that happend was betral and fights! The author should stick to one plout not go back and forth. The end was just depresing and I wanted to sream.
5,Amazing,"THE BEST BOOK EVERIt is amazing truly amazing, great, creative, different,and so much more that words can't even describe how great this book and this series is"
1,Highly Overrated,"There must have been a reason for being rejected by the publishers multiple times. Invisible Monsters tries to imitate post modernist literary technique of 'flash forward flash back' and attempts to stylize itself like a magazine about the lives of four charachters. The themes could have been contained in a much better written short readers digest story. Yes, it is about reinvention and liberation. You too can use lots of awkward grotesque imagery and descriptions, and cheap metaphors. Stream of consciousness is not for everybody. Sorry Chuck. Yes, even you fourteen year olds can write better than Chuck. Good luck. Disengage cranium from posterior."
4,Great read!,"I just finished reading Inivisible Monsters after reading Fight Club. Invisible Monsters doesn't have the dark humor of Fight Club, but it does have many more unexpected twists and turns. Just as soon as you feel that you've figured out the mystery, the story takes on a whole other slant. You'll rack your brain trying to figure out who is who and their relationships to one another. If you can guess even half of the ending then you must by psychic. As always, Chuck Palahniuk delivers a visual coup de force taht will leave you breathless and wanting to read the whole story over again."
2,Not his best,"I loved both Fight Club and Survivor. Invisible Monsters, though, pales by comparison to both of those novels. It is very difficult for men to write convincingly from the standpoint of a woman. There were many points in the book when it was blatantly obvious that the author was a man and didn't quite understand what it's like to be a woman. (A woman would probably not think about her breasts being hard when she was holding a frozen turkey against them.) The plot was driven by bizarre turns of fate that, though interesting, seem forced. The only truly brilliant writing in the novel revolves around the protagonist's parents. I've read few other things that equal the genius of the Christmas chapter. Unfortunately, that chapter cannot make up for the rest of the novel."
3,More of the same,"Fight Club and Damned were brilliant, and a breath of fresh air, but sadly Invisible Monsters shows Palahniuk to be something of a ""one-trick pony,"" re-hashing many of the same themes and ideas in much the same way."
3,Great for odd tastes,"This book was hard for me to get into at first. I kept picking it up and putting it down for months. When I finally focused on it, it turned out to be really interesting. Give it a fair chance. You'll be surprised and intrigued."
4,Invisible Monsters,Book came in perfect condition. Very happy i bought it. Its a very different story i highly recommend it to anyone interested in becoming a model.
2,Sick = Good?,Sick! This book was just twisted in my opinion. All the characters as well as the author need psychological help. I thought I might need some for the simple fact that I was able to get through the entire thing.
5,Chuck Palahniuk at his finest,"When I think of Chuck Palahniuk, one of my favorite authors, I think of Invisible Monsters and Choke. I believe, his truly best novels."
2,Second Wives,I found Second Wives by Susan Shapiro Barash a disappointing read. The individual case studies were simplistic to a degree that prevented them from being interesting. Perhaps as a result of this the author's analysis of the data was also too simplistic to be useful. It is hard to imagine how anyone could profit from reading this book.
2,Baby No Thanks!!!,This book was tedious and difficult to get through. It did not provide much in the way of solutions to problems except 'have a baby'.
1,JON's SCRAPBOOK,"Instead of putting together a definitive objective history, Wilkman has assembled clips of his FavoriteMovieStars, with deliberate suspicious omissions. It's like something a star-struck 13 year old would produce; like he used this opportunity to satisfy childish personal vendettas by deliberately ignoring these artists. What's left is cursory and merely OK. Too bad..."
5,"great, if this is your taste in books","This was one of the more intense books I've read in a while. It didn't take me long to finish it but boy did I enjoy every second. This is a very VERY violent and graphic book. If you can stomach reading some nasty things and if that's what your looking to read I recommend this book. The story is nothing special... Pretty much two boys get captured and get tortured by a crazy man. There was one point in the book where I was surprised and I felt made the book a lot more memorable just because of the emotion involved.I very rarely reread books but this will definitely be one that I revisit again in a few months.So in summary; violent, short, intense, simple story and only for a select few readers."
4,good resource,"great introduction to phonetics, although some of the standard and typical presentations can be misleading when individual speech is analyzed and shows much more variation. he is more exact in this book at setting specific boundaries compared with some of his later books. a great resource to refer to later also with lots of basics, easy to read and understand, CD is helpful too"
5,Great!!,Got to us in great condition!! It's great for poker games and helps anyone who needs a lil help from time to time. Great for a poker room!
4,My review..,This is a good 80's hard rock album (for those who like 80's hard rock). I recomend this. Doro's voice is killer and the songs are real good as well.
2,My least favorite,"Anya , Battle Rages and Solitaire are very good songs. The rest of this album was really a disappointment for me as a fanatical Deep Purple fan. I honestly to this day listen to (the generally poorly received) Slaves and Masters more often. To my ears it sounded like a group who rushed to get the Cd out prematurely. In fact, songs like Lick it Up, One Man's Meat. and Talk About Love Reminded me of reject songs off Ian Gillan's solo LP Naked Thunder."
2,The last hurrah for Ritchie Blackmore,"This is a pretty steep dropoff from ""Perfect Strangers"" and ""House of Blue Light"" which were already a steep dropoff from the glory days of the early 70's. Blackmore seems to be about out of ideas (confirmed by his subsequent bailout and move to acoustic Renaissance music) and Gillan's vocals are multi-tracked and mixed into oblivion. Nevertheless, fans of the classic lineup will find a few nice moments here. The title track and ""Anya"" are about as good as anything they did in the 80's, but the remaining tracks are mostly uninspiring (and sometimes difficult to tell apart)."
5,Prince of Peace,"Wonderful true story told by a comforting Walter Cronkite voice and heavenly Mormon Tabernacle Choir. This is one of the ""regulars"" that I read with my children each Christmas, illustrating that the power of the spirit of Christmas can disarm complete armies. A wonderful testament that Jesus Christ literally is the Prince of Peace."
2,NO FIXX!!,"Come on, The Fixx's ""One Thing Leads to Another"" is probably the best song on FLASH FM, and it's not here. What's the DEAL?"
5,VERY clever,Great chairs. Fairly easy to set. Can't wait to take to the caribbean beaches! Also - best price!!
1,least played of all my bgs albums,yawn... this is sooo boring i bought it in 1999 and ive only ever played it twice(my average is once or twice a year)
1,Japanese Track List of 2004 Japan Reissue:,"The same track list of US versions, no bonus track:1. Saw A New Morning2. I Don't Wanna Be The One3. South Dakota Morning4. Living In Chicago5. While I Play6. My Life Has Been A Song7. Come Home Johnny Bride8. Method To My Madness"
3,Losing interest - characters not moving me.,"I enjoyed the first of the trilogy, most of the second, but I'm probably not even going to finish the third. I feel Ms. Novik is clever and writes very well but I'm finding I just don't care about the characters. In contrast with the Pern series which this one borrows heavily from, the characters are just words. Also the wonderful Vorkosigan series by Bujold - her characters live and breathe, make you laugh, cry, etc. I read many books while exercising on my Nordic Track and tend to judge those by how absorbed I get. 5 stars means I could exercise forever - well almost. With the third of this triology, I can't even put in my full 30."
4,Black Powder War - series is back on track,"In this book, the dragon Temeraire and his captain, Will Laurence, are preparing to return home to Britain from China when they receive orders to retrieve three dragon eggs from the Ottoman Empire. In the interest of time, they risk a dangerous overland journey rather than going by sea. But the mountains, deserts, feral dragons and interference of the Turks are minor troubles compared to the wrath of an oriental dragon hell-bent on ruining their lives, even if she must change the tide of world war to do it.Another page-turner. Much better than Throne of Jade if still perhaps not quite as good as His Majesty's Dragon (but that one has the benefit of being first, with no basis for comparison). Regardless, I can't wait to read whatever Novik writes next..."
3,I'm losing interest,"I loved the first two books but this book was just too full of military battles - boring and depressing. I've looked ahead to the other books in the series and the plot line seems to be getting more and more depressing. While I have Empire of Ivory, this will be the last book in the series I read."
4,Black Powder War--with the keg about to be lit.,"This book makes me want book 4 all the more. Temeraire has picked up some oddly liberal ideas during his time away from the discipline of the British Dragon Corps, and intends to bring them back to England. This can't help but cause trouble (I am waiting for him to ask why women, who are trusted aviators in the Corps, don't have equal rights anywhere else).And the war with Napoleon (now himself in possession of a dragon who hates England, Temeraire, and most everybody more or less in that order) is heating up. I really want book 4 _now_. Thank you."
2,Part number for part received incorrect via WeatherTech,"I gave this item two star. I purchased these for my boyfriend for Christmas. He went to put the mats in his truck and they seemed too small and did not fit properly at all. The part of the tray that was supposed to reach the side of the running board (where the door closes...) did not even reach the door.So wondering if I got the correct part or not, we called WeatherTech directly. A very nice woman at WeatherTech said that the part number given to us through Amazon was for a Ford Explorer - not for an F350, his truck, like I had thought I ordered through Amazon's ""right fit"" easy guided, form check.Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I'm an amazon fan in most cases - but not this time! I'm sure it fits a Ford explorer though..."
3,Cinderella CD,This is obviously a bootleg CD. Need to update your recording equipment. The music is there but the sound lacks clarity and quality.
3,The Odds review,Thought the book provided some valuable vegas insight. Not sure the writer truly understands the in's and outs of sports betting. I did find the book entertaining though.
4,Gamblers in good hands with Chad Millman,A very entertaining look at sports bettors in Las Vegas. The narrative is full of movement and humor and just enough pathos to keep it real but not bleak. Chad Millman is a great descriptive writer. He shows real talent at bringing to life the atmosphere of Vegas casinos and horse tracks in a fresh way. Fantastic insight and anecdotes. A must read for anyone who enjoys nonfiction gambling stories.
2,The unusable dictionary,"This would really be a great dictionary if the company allowed it to be installed on one's own SD Card. Instead, one must remove your card and install the one that came with the product each time you want to use the dictionary.Handmark's Oxford English Dictionary allows you to install without requiring its own dedicated card. However, once you reach high school age, this dictionary is worthless. There are few words more than 2 syllables long in it.Too bad the much more advanced Merriam Webster Dictionary is so unuseable."
4,Easy to use but -,"Easy to use, but cannot reference the dictionary when in another program which limits its use. A very good dictionary & thesaurus otherwise."
4,fun family flick,"Pulls off a fun, entertaining, period western for a fraction of the typical Hollywood production budget!"
2,The movie is better than the book,"Wow. I never thought I'd say that. I love the movie so I thought for sure I'd love the book. Wrong. It's hard to enjoy a novel when you HATE the main character. Obviously I knew this didn't have likeable characters or a happy ending, but the book takes it too far. I will not give away the plot but I will say the book is much more violent than the movie, and the descriptions are so detailed that I cringed in some parts. I am giving this book 2 stars only because Scott Smith is an excellent writer, and the story he created here is amazing, but I believe that it is too violent, unnecessarily so. If you like books that describe death in bloody detail (both human and family pets) then this book is for you."
5,Excellent read!,This book was definitely a page-turner!It's full of suspense and anyone who is into that will definitely love this book.
3,Style over substance,"I picked up A SIMPLE PLAN mainly on the basis of the effusive blurb from Stephen King, who has recommended other thrillers I've enjoyed. Indeed, Scott Smith shows some King influence in his excellent writing style, particularly in the sense of foreboding that dominates this novel. But the events of A SIMPLE PLAN strain credibility. In particular, the fate of Hank's brother Jacob and the final two acts of violence in the story simply are not to be believed, making it difficult to look upon the characters in this novel as real. I admire Scott Smith's prose and hope his second novel is easier to swallow."
5,What would you do for $4 million?,"A Simple Plan is an excellent tale of blackest heart suspense. Shocking, to say the least. One of the best novels of ordinary people pitted against extraordinary circumstances that I have ever read. Deceit. Treachery. Greed. Murder. An unexpectedly high body count.A Simple Plan goes high on the recommendation list, if not for its brazen, machete like impact then for its amazing originality. Read this unforgettable book and then watch the equally disturbing film. Nothing's ever simple when there's money involved.""Being a murderer doesn't necessarily mean anything."""
3,Disturbing,"This book gave me a stomach ache every time I sat down to read it. It was very disturbing to me to read about supposedly ordinary people committing such violent acts. I think I would have felt better about it, had common sense taken hold of the characters."
3,"A good book, but a little predictable.","This book started off great, but began to go down hill about half way through, although entertaining, it was a little unrealistic. I hope the movie is better."
2,FREE VIOLENCE,"THey softened the history in the movie. I was shocked by the free violence. THe scene in which Hank kills an old woman in a store is totally unecessary, and the ridiculous destiny of his daughter (an accident which crippled her) has nothing to do with the history, as if, for having murdered seven people, a crippled child would make things even. Bá !"
2,"A silly, depressing book","I was very disappointed in this book, in light of the excellent reviews, including one by Stephen King. The plot was illogical, but after a while became predictable. The mood is dark and claustrophobic, which would be tolerable if the plot were not so silly. The characters were initially well drawn, and the writing is strong, but these strong points can not overcome the spirallingly predictable plot."
5,You'll lose sleep reading the book! Even after you're done!!,"This book will captivate you from cover to cover. A stunning depiction of ""normal"" people, doing the most uncivilized act for the lowest form of temptation, Money. A Simple Plan, is the most entertaining book I have ever read, bar none. A beautifully written novel that grips its readers to the very end. Not only an incredible story, A Simple Plan causes you to think about what you would do if you found $4 million. What lengths would you go to in order to keep it? Would you kill? An amazingly real look at the heart and soul of a man with everything to lose and the chance of 4 million dollars to gain. Read it!!!"
2,"Intriguing Idea, but Too Many Corpses and Depressing",I liked the idea - first-person view of how an ordinary guy falls into some very dark and increasingly complex situations.... Isn't that how they say most murders occur? Ordinary people get caught up in something they can't control and.... But by the end of the book I thought he was an idiot and I was depressed. I didn't like anybody in this book.
2,A Simple Mind,"I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation."
3,A Bit Overrated,"In spite of this being a real page-turner, I found the story to be fairly predictable w/ tired dialogue at times."
2,No fun in the sun.,"OK the concept of a small chair that reclines got to me. But what you get is a chair that feels like you are always in the reclining position.Also the stitching at the front of the arm rest near the cup holder has undo stress due to the design of the chair, mine came undone on the first trip. Its cheaply made so the price for this chair is also a drawback . On the plus side it is a very light chair to carry around and easy to pack, but knowing what I know now I'd buy something else."
2,Light not necessarily better,"While I was impressed with the video about this chair and was excited to get it, the chair became a disappointment after only using it twice. The trim on the arms tore through and it really does not slide up and down in the sand. Next time I will carry the extra weight and get a chair with wooden arms."
3,Just O.K.,"The chair is fairly comfortable, but after one day, the stitching on the left arm started to come apart. I imagine this would lead to an eventual failure of the chair. I contacted the manufacturer to see about replacing the arm and they stated that it is a non-replaceable part. They actually shipped me out a new chair instead. Quality ""C""...Customer Service ""A+""."
5,Love this chair,This is a great chair. I wish it came with a bag with shoulder strap but the chair has shoulder straps. I would recommend this chair and seller.
3,Canopy needs replaced.,"I used it just a few times on vacation, the stays on the canopy poked through and made holes!!! I would like the whole canopy replaced, for what I paid for this ""beach set!"""
4,Great Chair,"I bought this chair so I could bike ride to the beach in Chicago. The chair is pretty comfortable, I prefer it in the reclined position. I haven't tried the canopy yet. I like that this chair is pretty simple to set up/take down for a quick trip. I definitely reccommend it!"
1,NEVER GOT IT,"I ordered this chair for an upcoming camping trip, they sent me a huge empty box with only the canopy in it. tried to contact the company and never got a response. very very upset and still need a chair for my trip"
4,Great Chair,I purchased 2 of these chairs to take down to the Gulf. They go together easily and are very comfortable. The sun shade is great and kept me from getting burned. I had to carry it on my back for some distance and it was no problem. My only complaint is that one seam has pulled apart already--at the end of the armrest. Don't know if its repairable or not. I would have given it 5 stars if it had not been for that.
4,"Allright, allright!","Some of these reviews are hard to read, lmao. Granted this was the 80's and I'm glad I was born in 81. Because some of these beats let me know how the clubs were in the 80's wack! Just kidding.Anyway, Vanessa has some cuts I like ""Be A Man About It."" Also ""If You Really Love Him."" Other than that it's not that bad.You want bad but Paula Abdul's ""Forever Your Girl."" Lol and listen to ""Next To You."" Then you will know what it sounds like to cringe."
3,"Not bad, but not what i wanted","This a great movie, if you are looking for the history and backround of just a few events there. I.e. full throttle saloon, hill climb, and a few others.It really did not go into a lot of detail of the event, I was hoping to see more biker interviews, bikes, events at various bars, etc.The ""one million motorcycles"" version of this series was better, in my opinion.The best I have seen on sturgis so far, would be ""Sturgis Uncensored"" which gives a much better insiders look at the partying, and many interviews."
1,Spend a little more and buy a better one.,Very LoudNo on/off switchYou can't control outputI really do not like this humidifier at all. For $10-$15 more you can get a much better one.
5,Stellino's stellar shape,"This cookbook is out of print, so locating one in such excellent condition was especially fortuitous. Since it was a gift for my daughter I was more attentive to its shape, knowing that its contents are without question. She is enjoying her used-new cookbook."
3,Felt prayers,"Foster offers up in this work a heart-felt collection of prayers. He includes sources from quite the breadth of traditions, but does stay within the broad bounds of Christianity.People should look in this book for expressions of a soul's feeling rather than any rationale as to how one should pray. It seems to me the focus of this collection is how we want to approach God, rather than be concerned with how God wants to be approached. The ecumenical reader will likely appreciate this book more than anyone who has an appreciation for thought-out Biblical doctrine."
1,Save your money!,I was very disappointed in this book. Everything I read about it before purchasing it sounded so good. It was dry and boring. I probably only read about twenty pages and decided not to torture myself anymore.
5,"Very touching, very original, funny love story","I just found this film to be good in every way. What a breath of fresh air to see such a genuine, heartfelt film like they don't make in Hollywood anymore. Full of wonderful moments and excellent performances (Troy Winbush as Douglas and Lupe Ontiveros as Grandma Josie are a riot!). Just a wonderful surprise for an independent film."
5,Vice's Best Radio Station,This station was always my favourite in Vice City. Every track is great 80's music. Definitely the best CD in the collection.
4,A nice starter,You miss the 90's then let's get back to the basics of the past. I just love to enjoy others pain and know I have this in my E-library.
5,Love Dilbert,"Nothing more to say, really. Early Dilbert sometimes leaves something to be desired, but I always enjoy Scott Adam's work."
1,Don't waste your time,"This Jack Van Impe guy doesn't know what he's talking about. he misinterprets everything just to fit into what he's saying. Im not sure whats worse, this terrible version of the bible, or his pathetic lies that he calls his TV show. Don't waste your time with this."
2,Pretty junky but cute,"First of all, I don't know why this is $79.99..I bought this at TRU less than a month ago for $29.99..It didn't come with the doll, but I mean really, $79.99???This is a pretty junky toy. The scanner is REALLY hard to work and the thing to ""sign"" for your credit card is lame. Also, the stupid cash register drawer won't stay shut so the money keeps falling out everywhere. I am noticing this is a trend with the Dora Toys in general, because while most Dora stuff is really cute, the quality is very poor. I have problems with the Magical Castle furniture and also the Dora Kitchen. But this register is not worth the $29.99 and DEFINITELY not worth $79.99..I'd go with something else."
2,Could have been an article,The concept of the book was great but it wasn't done as well as it could have been. Jesus could be mean and act wild but I felt this book tamed some of the wildness of Jesus and didn't explore as much or as far as it could have. The book could and should have been shortened into a article or series of articles.The author gave it a try and I respect him for that but the book left me feeling like I wasted time. Nothing new was really gleamed from it for me.Worth a read through if you can borrow it.It maybe that this is a book for people with too rosy a picture of Jesus. I wasn't raised on a weak and hippie like Jesus but the Jesus that drove people out of the temple with a discount whip and spared no words for the Pharisees.
1,does not alert you to emergencies,"June 10, 2008: The National Weather Service issues a Tornado Watch for the entire state of Vermont. You would think this weather radio, turned on and with fresh batteries, would go crazy and sound an alarm, or at the very least display that there has been a tornado watch issued. Nope. This weather radio didn't. Other things I don't like about it: Difficult to set up. Difficult to get to the weather radio. VERY POOR RECEPTION!!!! I had to leave it in one specific spot in my house to get reception, and if I moved it a millimeter, it would lose it's signal. Would I reccomend it? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! What I would reccomend is the Midland WR-100 model.Midland WR-100B SAME Weather and All Hazards Alert Monitor with Alarm Clock"
1,Interesting,"You probably realized that Brandon Lee doesn't play in this movie, for the most part. He was not in any of the fight scenes; there were someone else --a stunner. Movie has no plot. It is just another movie that tries to catch attention from small kids. One can even see that all punches and kicks DO NOT EVEN TOUCH AN OPPONENT. The movie is [bad]; there is nothing else to add. If you really want to watch it, because Brandon is playing, RENT IT DON'T BUY IT."
2,A big letdown,"After the last three albums, this was a big letdown. I'm sorry, there's nothing memorable on this one. All it made me do was listen to 'Long Distance Voyager' more often."
5,No Wind Of Blame,"Classic Heyer. A good story with a neat twist at the end. If you like mysteries, you'll like this."
1,CRAP!,THATS ALL i GOT TO SAY! Doesnt work. I cant stop perspirating. Within 2 hours I begain to have a B.O. Heck useless!
2,Too strong,I wore this deodorant for half a day and had to wash my arm pits because i didn't like the smell. It smells like something an old lady would wear. I have no idea if it would break me out or not because i didn't wear it long enought. I guess if someone likes the smell of it then i guess its good deodorant for them. Other than that i'll pass.
4,Great Product...lights a little annoying.,"This is a great product that is a must have for any A/V system. Cheap insurance against power anomalies that can be damaging to any piece of electronic equipment. By the way...it will not improve the picture sound quality like some say.The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the lights on the front panel are quite bright and distracting. They should have used dimmer lighting or had a dimming feature. Not a deal breaker, but something to be aware of."
5,Great Product!,"I bought this as extra protection for my Samsung 56 inch DLP and audio system. Compared to using a normal surge protector, the Monster HTS 2600 indeed provided a clearer picture, cleaning up the snow and artifacts. I haven't really tested out the audio yet. It's good for peace of mind, as I want to protect my expensive investment."
5,Best Radio station in GTA: Vice City,"Whenever I play GTA: Vice City, I often find myself listening to this radio station. This station sums up the 80's perfectly, lots of synthesizers, catchy lyrics, and a great beat. Recommended for anyone who's played Vice City, or likes 80s music in general."
3,"Sanding discs. 5""","These discs seem to wear out one heck of a lot faster than others I've used, but then you get what you pay for!"
3,"Enough Praise, Now the Truth","Nico was always more of a persona than a musician. CHELSEA GIRLS is mostly comprised of songs written by the men who worshipped her creepy charms. Unfortunately, Nico embraces each of these well-crafted melodramas with the same off-kilter monotone. This is sometimes moving, sometimes numbing, and sometimes (unintentionally) hilarious. Although its a brief album, it's best not to listen to the entire work in one sitting. Nico's voice contains no charm or sincerity. What many interpret as sullen depth and morosity is more likely the droning buzzes and bleeps of a burnt-out robot that no one bothered to unplug. But I still recommend this album!"
4,can't believe these reviews,"Guess what. Nico was aware of the fact that she was not technically a great singer. She came out of a European tradition of ""chanteuses"" or cabaret where style and substance blurred. What she later built onto that was an understanding of avant-garde poetry and music. That's why one critic (richard goldstein) referred to her as ""another cooler Dietrich for another cooler generation"" (ok, ok, so he was no doubt flattering himself there too, but he had a point).For me, ""Chelsea Girl"" was a lovely first solo effort. Her later music became infinitely more daring and challenging. Many people can listen to this lp for the wrong reasons (nice songs; where else can you hear all this early Jackson Browne?). Those same folks are lost with the Marble Index or Desertshore.Nico hat mein Leben grundsaetzlich geaendert. Ohne sie haette ich niemals Deutsch studiert."
5,"Great, great overlooked songs.","Okay I would agree with anyone who says Nico is highly overrated. Truly the only thing more tragic than the pit of self-pity and narcissism she dug herself into is the fact that I haven't heard these incredible songs done justice. A shame Sandy Denny hadn't recorded this songbook for us. Still, priceless - especially for budding folk musicians and enthusiasts who hunger for something meaningful in a genre populated by hacks and the wretched albums offered as 'folk'."
4,Scary Dog Toy!!,"This toy is adorable but my Yorkie is scared to death of it - I think it is the long snout! Anyway, I think it is cute and my ""baby"" loves the matching Piggy - just not this bird."
1,A shower radio that is does not work well with water and is not for morning showers,"The volume, memory, and tuning controls are a pain in the butt. i.e. if you want to change the volume, you have to press the ""volume button"", then the up/down buttons. However, if you are not fast enough, you have to hit the ""volume button again"". Considering that in most cases I am barly awake when I go into the shower in the a.m., this radio is hard to use. ---- OH YEAH, the radio has stopped working after 3 months. It is not located by a direct hit under the showerhead, in fact it's the furthest away from the showerhead in my shower, yet it still got water inside and stopped working. This was a slow death that started with buttons getting stuck, then losing the LCD screen, then death."
1,Save your money. Buy something that won't break immediately,"The LCD screen broke shortly after purchase and on a radio this user un-friendly, it was almost unusable. A few months later, the volume got stuck at the highest level than it just stopped playing. Avoid this piece of junk."
1,electronic waste,Having read other reviews on this radio I feel lucky that my purchase lasted at least 7 monthes before it went dead. Once stung is enough. I'll never buy another Jensen product again.
4,Good multipurpose pump,I haven't attached it to my bike yet. It works well though. I like the multi-option valve. Great value for a handpump. Be sure to check out their website it you can't figure out how to switch the valve. The IKEAesque directions are a little confusing.
2,Works but after a struggle,"I purchased this pump and tried using it before a really long ride... It took me about 30 min to get it to work in my house, after i lost most of the air in my tire trying to get it to work and still wound up with really low tire pressure. I wound up having to go to my local bike shop to use their pump... This is only good for extreme emergencies where you have no other choice..."
2,"Good starter, but no staying power","Bought without any research from that well known bike shop beginning with ""H"". Looked good, with a handy bracket that secures well to your frame, but I ended up carrying mine in my backpack.On the plus side - this pump worked well for about two years of regular use. I'm a regular weekend club mountainbiker, and would use the pump almost weekly, just for punctures. I have a stand pump for general inflation. It's not too heavy, and fitted nicely into my packs. But that's about it...On the minus side - after a while the pumping power faded, as the plunger wore out. The connection mechanism to the valve also wore quickly. The other day it gave up after half inflating the tyre.Try Blackburn (with a lifetime guarantee as long as you keep it) at a fraction more of the cost."
4,When Mother was Eleven foot four,"It was a very, very short christmas Memory book. Some woman will probably relate to it and others will not get it.I was looking at the Mother figure from the child's view. All things are possible"
1,no-good on my kindle!,"This maybe a cute story, the premise is interesting, but several of what I assume are key pages have the text artistically placed in the illustration. I can't read it,"
4,Hick Soliloquies,"Ramsay Midwood's monotone blues style sounds like a drunk John Fogerty with a mouth full of cotton. Yet this album is quite appealing. Midwood shares the crusty sensibilities of Tom Waits, and punctuates his songs with witty zingers and clever rhyme schemes. The backing band brings a porch-jam festiveness to Midwood's hick soliloquies, and the CD is full of unexpected musical and lyrical detours. ""Esther"" has warm piano touches and is the most sentimental of the songs here. Most of the tracks, however, convey the funny-strange desperation of a world-weary hick who hasn't lost his sense of humor. ""Spinnin' on This Rock"" is what I'll sing to myself when I'm an old man."
4,Lovecraft's Co-conspirators,"This is a great companion to the other Del Rey editions of H.P. Lovecraft's work. This is a testament to not only other authors creating within Lovecraft's mythology, but personalizing it. Fritz Lieber's Terror From the Depths stands out as an example of this. Primarily interesting are the three correspondence stories between Lovecraft and Robert Bloch (The Shambler From the Stars, The Haunter of the Dark, and The Shadow From the Steeple). Upon finishing this I was more curious of Lovecraft's correspondence with his readers and colleagues.Cthulhu 2000: A Lovecraftian Anthology and Shadows Over Innsmouth are wonderful companions to this volume."
4,One of King's Best Ever!,"I loved this book! I only gave it four stars just because I didn't like what happens to Dennis and Leigh at the end. Still , it was amazingly thrilling from beginning to end. Actually , at times I found it hard to put the book down. It even made me sad at times . If you read this book , you'll know exactly what I mean. READ IT! I garuntee that you won't be able to put it down."
4,Creepiest Car ever,"I enjoyed this book, but expected a bit more. I had read that this was so scary and just terrifying. In my case I didn't think it was scary or creepy. It was however very well written and it was suspenseful. It kept me listening to the point I was ignoring my coworkers (more than usual) and caused them to throw stuff at me to get my attention.The book was a bit slow at times and some of the info could have been left out, but for the most part it was very engaging and interesting to read. The pace was very good overall and I loved the character development. Each character was fun to learn more and more about. It really made some very likable and others so evil it was almost a joy to hate them.For one of King's earlier works I can safely say that he has stayed consistent in quality and depth of his writing. I was expecting to be scared out of my mind, but will happily settle for a great suspenseful ride in Christine."
2,Worst Bone Album of all time,"I am a huge fan of BTNH, but even I will admitt this is not a good album. The worst being ""Home"" which uses samples from Phil Collins. The whole thing feels kind of empty, with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works. There are a few songs worth listening to. Most notably is ""Clevland is the City"" which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any ""harmony"" to it. Other songs worth mentioning are ""What About Us"", ""Not my baby"" and ""Pump,Pump"",the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage. It is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released."
2,Please skip this one. Worst Bone group album yet!,"It seems like the boys in Bone get worse and worse, when it comes time to drop a group album. This is their worst effort yet. Nothing too exciting at all on this CD, but ""Not My Baby"", ""Money Money"", and ""Pump Pump"", are the few highlights on an otherwise mediocre disc. It looks like Creepin On Ah Come Up and E. 1999 Eternal will go down in history as the only Bone Thugs albums worth owning."
5,Rap Greatness,"Two Words : Rap Greatness . If you don't have this album in your collection you don't have the best Bone album of all-time. This album is gonna be right up there with the Snoop ""Doggystyle"" album and Dre ""Chronic"" album. Instant classic for any rap fan. East Coast, West Coast it don't matter Bone is universal."
3,Still hot,I will admit to being a little bias because ever since E1999 bone has been my favorite group that brings realness to the game. The four thugs from cleaveland have grown up through the years and their songs show it. So this album isn't the hard F the world do what ever bone that was on their first four albums from faces of death to art of war but they can still rap and even though they lost the hardness for the most part they still have the realness of ghetto life. So it's worth getting just don't expect another E 1999
3,"Not bad, but Definetly not their best","When I first got this cd, I have to say that I was very excited and expecting a lot of out Bone. I mean, u should expect alot out of them....their other cd's are unbelievable! When I listened to the cd for the first time I thought it was trash. But after I listened to it again, I got used to a few songs and I enjoy the cd.....Some songs to look for are money, money, money,...Not my baby....and Get up, and get it."
4,Enjoyable,"The episodes coming from this product are clear even if they are not blue-ray.I haven't got used to the English dub, but I have to day it was good overall."
1,Total Data Loss,"Well, I bought one 1.5 years ago. Then it just died. The computer stop seeing it when plugged in, and the disk would spin and spin and would not even turn off. I could not recover any data. The only thing more disappointing than the HDD was the customer service when I tried to troubleshoot the problem / recover the data. NEVER AGAIN!"
1,"Really, really poor quality files",These mp3s are ~130 kb and sound even worse. It sounds like the first things I heard via streaming media players back in 1995. The bass is so distorted it sounds like two instruments. I expected better quality mp3s from Amazon.
5,What a great experience this book was!,"I love to read well-written history, but I have had to struggle through a few to learn more about our world. This book taught me a great deal about the history of the West, but it was also an absolute thrill to read.The author has me dashing out this weekend to pick up everything else he's written."
1,Fire the narrator,"Book is fine, the narrator mispronounces many words, such as Potomac, caballeros, acacia - where is the editor?? Please fix this."
5,Solid,"If you're intrigued at all by the wild west, and aren't looking for a bunch of boring facts, this is the book for you. Very well written and very intriguing. It starts a bit slow with several separate stories, but they all come together. This is the kind of book that makes you want to visit Kit Carson's gravesite and brag about it to your friends."
4,pretty good.....if you already have #3,"Hey, if you're a fan of punk covers go buy Punk Chartbusters NUMBER THREE. It's better than #4. If you already have #3 this one's almost as good. Much like #3 there are a bunch of German bands I've never heard of & most of them [stink]. Standouts are The Living End's version of ""Tainted Love"", Schandfleck's ""Torn"" & ""S.O.S."" by the Mad caddies. Sewing With Nancy and Die Toten Hosen do good songs too."
3,Gibralter Moto throne 960 HM,The Gibraltar throne is comfortable. But the rod that the saddle fits on swivels and is not rigid. Can be an interference when playing.
5,I love them!,T.A.T.U is such a wonderful group!! For all of those people that give them hell.... you probably haven't heard there music in english or Russian! They are wonderful! If you still don't like them....don't write nasty words about them! I love there music! Give these ladies a brake! Do you know how hard it is in Russia to become what they are!?
4,It depends on your taste..,"In my opinion, Taty's Russian music is ten times better than their English album. The lyrics fit better and they sound a whole lot better. Songs like 'Klouny', 'Nas Ne Dagoniat', and 'Doschitai Dos Da' are very catchy whether you are a native speaker or not. I recommend this album to anyone who knows or is interested in knowing Russian."
4,Review of Barefootin by Norman Chenoweth,"Barefootin is a story of a man, his wife and daughter preparing for and going on vacation.The lure:""--Bask in the unspoiled beauty that can only be found from the deck of a sailing ship powered by steady trade winds. We offer a unique blend of glamour, intrigue and tropical ease that gives you the choice to do absolutely nothing or everything.Come with us and find pristine beaches, waterfalls and lush tropical beauty that will stay in your dreams forever. Romance and adventure awaits you on the Northern Merchant in Nassau, Bahamas.""With a mixture of people from many backgrounds all on vacation and put together on a small sailing vessel visiting several islands in the Bahamas. The diverse religions in the area include voodoo. The local islanders have a secret. You will be kept in suspense and wonder as the story progresses and strange things begin to happen."
1,Missing songs...,"It needs the songs it's missing to be good IMO:Chemical Brothers - Outta Control Crystal Method - High RollerWithout those, meh."
2,Disappointed,"This soundtrack is missing the song that made the movie. Crystal Method's High Roller. If you guys want driving music... pick up their album: Vegas. Great movie, but it looks like I'll have to wait for The Fast and The Furious for any decent driving tunes."
3,Best Song in the CD,"As far as I'm concerned, the last song of the movie Good Times by Leroy is the best. Loved the beat!"
3,There are better choices,"There's really nothing much in this book that cannot be gained in Chris Peers' titles on Ancient and Imperial Chinese Armies for Osprey, which come with much better colour plates to boot. Better yet, read David A. Graff's ""Medieval Chinese Warfare"" and ""A Military History of China"" along with it. Peers, a popular historian, does make a good effort to liven up his prose, unlike Graff. But his reconstruction of events and battles sometimes borders on the sensationalistic. It would have been better if he had tried to be comprehensive, rather than basing his chapters on particularly exciting episodes a few centuries apart."
5,Danika....,"In my oppinion Marisa Tomei is a really great actress...and this movie proves it, she gave a very believeablle performance...I really wouldn't call this movie horror, but deff a thriller, and the endind will blow you away...i never saw that comming"
4,Attractive and Sturdy,"It was difficult finding a shiny brass grab bar. This matched the fixtures in my shower perfectly, so I bought three of them. I wanted sturdier anchors, so used heavier duty ones than the ones supplied. It would be better to find a stud. The flange didn't fit as snuggly as I would like, so I filled it with clear caulk and now am assured there will be no water getting inside. They look great and serve an important purpose for an elderly person."
4,Cinderella Man,"Great performances and a real insight into the depression. The boxing is really secondary, the story is what you think about long after the movie has ended."
4,Damn Good Boxing Movie,"Top-notch stars, notable director, unlimited production dollars = good movie. The movie is a true-life story of a boxer overcoming all odds during the depression. The acting was great, as expected, but it felt like just another boxing movie, no twists -- no turns. We've already seen this story in Rockies 1 through 14. Although, I must add that the acting and production are MUCH better in this movie."
1,Cinderella Man,This product was not what I expected and I have not as of yet received my refund for the defective item.
5,Wonderful human story,"I hate boxing & almost didn't see this movie because of it, but I am so very glad I took the chance & watched it anyway. It turned out to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. Russell Crowe was at his best, but more than that was this very moving story set during the depression. It showed a man who loved his family & did whatever it took to take care of them - without whining or fanfare. It is a must see family movie - except for smaller children due to the intensity of the boxing violence."
4,A Great Boxing Movie ( & Period Piece) You Might've Missed,"Cinderella Man is a stylish little biopic about a down-on-his-luck boxer trying to get his family through the Great Depression. He happens on a string of luck which winds up pitting him against the World Heavyweight champion--a boxer known for killing people in the ring.This is a feel good family affair with heart. Crowe is great in his role as is Paul Giamatti. It's also ""educational"" as it shows a convincing portrait of what living during the Great Depression might really have been like. It helps us to appreciate the simple abundance that we enjoy today. My one complaint might be that some of the boxing sequences were a little overlong/repetitive and that there were one or two slow parts, but otherwise the movie delivered on its promise.Largely ignored in the theater, but this is a good movie and well worth watching."
5,Triumph of Human Spirit,"Astounding performance from Russel Crowe in this movie on the life of Braddock. He slips in the character of the boxer, as if he was meant to do this role. He looked like a Gladiator in the namesake, and acted like a schizo in A Beautiful Mind. Dir - Ron Howard delivers a story of underdog and triumph of Human Spirit. I would recommend this movie to any person who is felling low in life. Besides many poignant moments in the movie, one of my personal favourite is the scene wherein before the match with Max Brear, braddock is shown the clipping on projector of how Max has killed all his opponents uptil now.Amazing Movie, Go for it."
1,A shame to Blu-ray tecnology !,"This is a good film but I don't understand why put it on a blu-ray disc. The quality video is just equal of a DVD. The industry should make a recall, like cars with problems. This is not what blu-ray was made for !!!"
5,Great Movie,If you want to watch an old movie on a Friday night then break out the popcorn and go to town!
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased this lock for my daughter to use at college. The previous year, I purchased an offspring lock for my older daughter from the same manufacturer. Since I was unable to purchase the same lock for my second daughter at retail stores, I thought this would be the same lock online. Wrong. Instead of two wings that come out when you install the lock, it only has one. I did not believe this lock would be secure and returned it. I contacted the seller by e-mail and was able to return the lock. However, I did not get reimbursed the shipping in either direction."
2,It does not worth it !!!,"Koyaanisqatsi is simply one of the most creative project i've ever seen. I really liked it and would recommend it to anyone. But believe me, i bought Anima Mundi in mint condition : considering it is out of print and was directed by Godfrey Reggio it cost a lot of money and does not worth it at all. Koyaanisqatsi has now been release, Anima Mundi should follow, and evidence as well. Anima is not amazing; it's interesting but not for this price."
3,Buyer beware!!!,"Perhaps it is a blessing that this one is out of print. Why? I find it overly derivative of it's predecessor (Koyaanisqatsi). Other than being way too short, and pretty unoriginal, it does have elements of the aforementioned masterpiece. But in my opinion, this is a case of riding that pony until it's dead. If you love Koyaanisqatsi, then join and buy that DVD, or wait until the legal battles are over to get that one. I think if you are expecting something different (or new) in this one, you will be disappointed. I got this one blind on a recommendation from someone who I am sure did not see Koyaanisqatsi."
4,fantastic learning aid,"My son used this video in his Pre- K class and really learned alot, so I decided to purchase it for his 3 year old sister. They both enjoy watching and learning at the same time. This video is both fun and educational"
4,"Worthy reissue, good price, bur flawed packaging","I missed out on the original issue, but as ""Arkansas Traveler"" isa favorite of mine, I picked up this reissue. Very good album, &some interesting stuff on the bonus disc. Great price, too, butthe packaging is lame. It is in a paper covered, cardboardclamshell box, like boxed-set LPs used to come in. This is sealed closed with a round, transparent sticker, which, in my case, tore the paper off the box when I tried to remove it. Inside, the two CDs are stacked on top of each other on a single sponge hub that is glued to the inside of the box. It tore loose the first time I tried to remove the CDs, leaving a sticky, gummy residue inside the box, which would, no doubt, stick to the CDs or booklet if you put them back in loose. You could transfer the CDs into jewel cases, but the booklet is too tall and thick to fit in with them. Very annoying."
4,"If you are looking for Life After God II, don't read this.","This book started off pretty drab.. and I wasn't sure if i was going to like it at all. I didn't relate to any of the characters though this might be because I was more of a child of the 80s than the 70s. After continuing through to the end, I was surprised and pleasantly delighted. I have read all of Coupland's novels and it is so difficult to not pit one book against another when reading his work. This is definitely not a book to read if you are looking for the sequel to Microserfs or Life After God. This is not a typical work by Coupland and it takes a more sci-fi look into our present lives. It deals with the same kinds of thoughtful insights into our culture and our generation but on a surreal level. After reading I was inspired and relieved that once again, good ole Douglas hadn't disappointed me."
2,Piffle!,"A crass attempt at a philosophical view of the 'human condition' which fails at all levels. We are subjected to the intimate thoughts and actions of a thoroughly meritless, shiftless and vacuous collection of misbegots without whom the world would be infintely better-off. The terms of their rehabilitation are presented to us as if they are profound and thought-provoking when in effect they are juvenile and shallow. Mr Coupland should read Darkness at Noon or its equivalent before dishing up his platitudes as truisms.For all that the literary style is readable, though unremarkable (and occasionally ungrammatical - my copy had at least one typo too).I would not recommend it for purchase but if one is bored or perhaps trapped in a holiday hotel during unexpectedly bad weather, it could be read in order to avoid being obliged to play endless games of Pictionary"
3,It has its moments but could be better,"Fans of Douglas Couplands work will like this book. If this is the first Coupland book you have read, you may not want to read any of the others, which would be a pity. His earlier works are well worth the read.I found it difficult to maintain interest throughout the book, and after putting it down, was in no hurry to pick it up again.I can't really describe how I felt about the book. It wasn't boredom, but the interest and enthusiasm just wasn't there, not for me anyway.IMO, he peaked with Microserfs, but that was two books ago. Lets hope the slide doesn't continue."
4,Clear and provocative,"Being hyper fictional and yet down to earth with contemporary issues, i was taken on a voyage to another place and back. The end evoqued fear of a posssible lost world accerlerated by the selfishness of humankind, the begining its evolution towards it. Coupland's ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" cannot be taken for granted. Plot developement and characters are interwoven to create a desir to change the way you talk to people, to constantly search for ""the truth"" in others; truth being everlasting and flawless, providing the basis for ""healthy"" living in confusing, consumer oriented times. This book should be read for its insight on human nature, and its storyline for a picture of a possible future-- RRM"
2,Douglas Coupland meets Heaven's Gate Cult????,"I've enjoyed most of Coupland's past books (especially Generation X, and Microserfs). This book is quite a disappointment because it starts out well then becomes completely rediculous. Without ""spoiling it"" for others, let me just say that the plot becomes completely unbelievable and the ""philosophy"" is embarassing. Coupland is either playing a VERY deep joke on us, or has ""cracked"" and is taking himself much too seriously!"
2,Doesn't match up to his earlier works,"Girlfriend in Coma started off in an engaging way, but fizzled out in the second half. I was on the verge of giving up on it half way through. This book hardly matches up to Copland's earlier works like GenX and Microserfs."
1,Shallow philosophical maundering and a deus ex machina,"I've really enjoyed much of Coupland's earlier work, but this was hard to take. I have a problem with middle-aged male authors who go on at great length asking the rhetorical question ""Life used to have so much meaning; what happened?"" (Hint: the only change was that your ability to perceive the presence or absence of meaning became more acute as you matured.) And that's not only a tiresome obsession in this book; it's what the book is about. Coupland also assumes that this phenomenon is unique to his generation, as if people haven't been grappling with it (and writing tiresome books about it) since the dawn of culture. Combine these with magical realism poorly done, an arbitrary deus ex machina to fix everything up at the end, and disappointingly flat prose and characterization (Coupland is capable of much better than this.) and you have a book that I would pay not to have to re-read."
1,Read at Your Own Risk!,"As Girlfriend in a Coma is fiction, I was willing to accept the concept of a ghost, the eighteen year coma and the sleeping illness. However, everything else about the book is nauseatingly bad. The characters? Oh Beb, we've seen 'em before. Completely Coupland and cliche to the hilt. By the way, what 34 year old *still* hangs out with all of his/her high school chums? Say, shouldn't we be referring to them as Richard and Karen CARPENTER? And since were on the topic of music superstars, what's with the nicked one-liners from The Smiths, REM, Pink Floyd, etc. It's just not *that* clever. Oh! Can we please hear about the Berlin Wall and AIDS one more time?Hey, if after all this ranting, you just simply MUST read the book, for Pete's sake, don't waste your hard earned money. Run (don't walk!) to your local library to read for yourself. Don't say I didn't warn you..."
1,"His weakest novel, by far","If you are looking for Coupland's best work, go read Generation X or Microserfs. I don't know quite what happened while he was writing this one, but it falls terribly flat in comparison.All of Coupland's work address the similar theme of ""Is what you see in life really all there is?"". The characters in his books passively and actively search for meaning in their own lives. That's why I love to read Coupland -- I think he's asking the right questions. But unlike his other books, where this theme is subtly developed through a believable plot, this one practically shouts at you through the most preposterous of plots.I couldn't wait to finish this book and throw it away. It was _really_ that bad. (And for everybody who thought Girlfriend in a Coma was amazing, go read his other stuff... truly.)"
4,This book really makes you think,"After reading this book, I re-analyzed life, the earth, and what our real purpose is on this big planet."
3,"I wanted ""More than this""","I've had this cd since it came out and I tend to judge my reaction to music based on one simple question. How much do I listen to it. Don't get me wrong, Peter's very very high on my favorite artist list and I certainly appreciate the creativity involved in UP but it just doesn't appeal to me the way US and SO continue to. It's almost like he got too eclectic for his (or my) own good this time and left some of us behind, scratching our noggins. I never expect ""perky"" top 40 fare from Mr. Gabriel but this one just never took hold in my psyche the way he's done in the past. Take ""Biko"" or ""I don't remember"" for example. They are definitely unusual songs but they stick in your mind forever. I still look forward to and will eagerly buy his next album (hopefully not a decade away) and will continue to allow Peter a wide berth in my musical boundaries. He is a visionary and one-of-a-kind."
5,ON FIRST LISTEN - THIS IS GREAT!,"I keep reading reviews that say this album will take many listens to unfold - and then you will appreciate it. Not in my experience. I listened to it once so far and I love it!It sounds like a cross between album #3 (""melt"" or ""melted face"") and the album ""Us"" with some new sounds added in.So, if you liked album #3 and want something even more up to date - get ""Up."" If you like Peter Gabriel because of ""Sledgehammer"" and ""Big Time"" then you might have to let this one unfold for a while. Or you might want to listen before you buy.By the way, the Barry Williams Show sounds good also. I don't know why people knock that song."
1,Cacophony for your Stereo,"After such luminary accomplishments as ""So;"" ""Passion,"" and ""Secret World Live,"" there can be no doubt that Peter Gabriel is a brilliant artist and visionary. That truth is precisely what makes ""Up"" such a bitter dissapointment.This album is absolutely horrible. It is almost unspeakably bad - a cacophonic disgrace. Several tracks are largely chaotic, lacking any sort of logical melodic flow. In particular, ""Darkness,"" the opening cut, is little more than a hideous amalgamation of electronic noise. I cannot think of anything sold as ""music,"" short of perhaps Marylin Manson's various disgraces, that has ever repulsed me more.Do yourselves and the world a favor - instead of buying ""Up,"" donate the money instead to some of Mr. Gabriel's favourite charities."
1,UP is LOUSY!,"Having been a fan of Peter's previous works, I was so excited for his new long long long awaited new cd and after listening....not one track is decent. His vocals sound weak, on DARKNESS he sounds like he is rapping....the cd is a trainwreck of every style possible. I am so dissapointed in waiting so long and having him come back a) with a cd of lousy material and b) only 10 tracks on it!Better luck next time...AVOID THIS CD!"
2,The man's in pain,"Some years back I saw Peter Gabriel in concert. This was his ""bald"" tour. He purposefully shaved his head in atonement for cheating on his wife. I say this because for anyone who is familiar with this man's music & performances will know that he is a very passionate man, almost wearing his emotions on his sleeve. And so it is with UP, his darkest, most inaccessible offering. More discord than rhythm, more disjointed than rhythmic.I offer a theory in the form of a question. Why do you suppose water is featured on the cover art? I suspect the answer lies in a review of his earlier work & note how often & in what context he refers to water & rivers."
4,Will Not Load Into iTunes,"Caution: if your are buying this for your iPod the Tracks and Information will not load onto iTunes. ""CDDB Error: Unsupported compression scheme requested""The CD is interactive it loads a pop up tries to open a browser & also incorporates an .exe file!"
3,Disappointing,"I have waited many years for a new Gabriel studio album and it was not worth it. For those of you that compare this to security are quite deluded. Security was a masterpiece. This is so so at best. Uninspired at times and grating at others. Especially Darkness which I find quite irritating. The Barry Williams show does not fit the flow of most of the album. Overall most of the CD is enjoyable but I expected much more.I am not such a snob that I consider liking something sub-par a sign of intellect. I assure you I am quite smart and I do in fact ""get it.""Final comment if you are a true Gabriel fan you will buy it regardless. I know I did and would again. Just don't expect too much."
1,now i lay me down to sleep,"UP is simply a very tired and lifeless sounding Peter Gabriel album. Regardless, he still remains one of the most brilliant recording artists of our time. For those who don't own any of Gabriel's earlier records (I met one such person recently), go and purchase SO and listen to ""IN YOUR EYES"" , ""MERCY STREET"", and ""DON'T GIVE UP"". By far some of the best songs he's ever written."
5,The best in about 10 to 15 years!,Many great songs starting with Darkness and many songs like Sky Blue. Kind of a industrial sound to this record but it works in many ways. The Blind Boys of Alabama provide great backing on many songs and the band is awsome. The whole CD is kinda bleak but points to brighter days ahead. if I could give it six stars I would. Awsome CD.
1,Peter must have gone over to the dark side....,"or at the very least not have gotten any loving lately because this mess of an albumn is all doom and gloom. I think people are confusing pure noise with complexity. After ten years if Peter cannot even give us one haunting or even barely memorable song there is a problem. Peter please,stop hanging out in bars that you are too old for listening to outdated techno: in the woods of Eminem- ""Nobody listens to Techno."" After the mess of a Millenium albumn you did please get some advisors who will bring you back to the ""Angel"" that you were, and maybe a little prozac wouldn't hurt either."
1,Disappointed,"We have a lake house and an inflatable raft 30 feet off the dock. I was very excited to order this product to use as a carriage for beverages to and from the raft. I have had it just a few weeks and it has never held air! Has a leak somewhere.My neighbor had the more expensive version ...the Yamaha brand, and it's awesome! I thought at 30.00 I assumed this one would be as good. Too late to send it back....should have stuck with a known brand."
2,Not so sure....,Just received my floating cooler. Am a little disappointed that the interior of the cooler has no nylon liner....I'm thinking maybe I should have ordered the Aqua Oasis...it has a removable cooler that just sits inside the tube....and....there is NO outside zippered storage pocket! You should take that out of your description. I'll be trying it this weekend on the lake....we'll see how it performs. Might be sending it back.
5,One of the best Brazilian singers ever!!!,"I first heard Mocidade...Padre Miguel and several other songs from this disc in the early 90's when I joined a samba group in New Orleans and just fell in love with Alcione's voice. Since starting to browse Amazon I have found some of my favorite brazilian artists and was ecstatic when I found this disc. Some of my favorites are Jacare Sumiu, Mimoso in which I get a feel of Native American spirit and drumming, Na Paz de Deus, and Fruto E Raiz with the children. These are some of her best songs and this disc is one of the best ever."
1,SELLER DISPLAYS FALSE ADVERTISING,This products stated in the products features that accessories were in cluded. I notified the seller when I rceived just a leotard for 35 dollars wondering where the rest of it was. The seller advises the product does not come with accessories. The ad for the product under the EXACT same place I pasted the exact description from was magically changed overnight. Horrible service!!!
1,Do Your Research,"Beware: this bit can take either a 1/4"" shank, or a 1/2"" inch shank, depending on your collet. I'm sure I am the only person in the world who assumed that because the title of this item says ""1/4 inch shank"", that a shank is included. It is not. So now I have to put the job on hold, and scramble to find a shank to connect the bit to my collet. What a collossal pain."
5,Tourist Trap,"Rebecca Schwartz is back again in a third installment, this time to catch a serial killer. San Francisco is left in fear when the ""Trapper"" begins to attack popular tourist spots. The old lovable characters are back to put a comical spin on the act of catching a serial killer and proving her accused client innocent--with green hair nonetheless. The terror running the streets of San Francisco can be felt in the vivid descriptions that Julie Smith creates.Tourist Trap is a wild chase through San Francisco filled with suspense and a fascinating view into the local culture of San Francisco."
2,...not my cup of tea...,"I bought this book together with the ""book about us"" from the same author. It is a book that could be interesting if you have children and want to document thier growing up. I didn't really see the use: the projects are not really ones I would tend to create: the subjects did not appeal to me and the layouts did not inspire me, which is strange as I really loved the ""book about us""."
2,Underpowered for ice cream drinks,"We had hoped that it could make an ice cream shake but it is very easy to stall the motor. It also is messy, if the liquid get's too thin it splashes outside of the metal cub. It also make a nasty grinding noise whenever the blade hits the cup which in unavoidable. A novelty item at best and not a real mixer unless you are just stirring a liquid which you may as well do with a spoon."
5,Blondie Fan Satisfied!,I love Blondie.This was a great addition to my collection.I would recommend this to any one that wants both music and video for their enjoyment.
4,"Good, but not good enough","As was mentioned by other reviewers, some of the songs are cut short, notably Heart of Glass & Rapture which are each 30 seconds shorter than the LP versions. Since the CD fills only 73-1/2 minutes, there is no excuse for shaving a minute. Maybe they thought we wouldn't notice? But what is really inexcusable is omitting Once I Had A Love (aka The Disco Song) which is only 3:18 minutes and helped define the disco sound, for which there was plenty of room. Bang A Gong (Get It On) should also have been included and there would have been room for it in lieu of Island Of Lost Souls or End To End, both trivial contributions."
4,One of The Best Blondie Greatest Hits,"A terrific collection of their greatest hits. Excellent sound quality and comes with a bonus dvd! Although, the re-make of ""In The Flesh"" I thought was boring and rather dull. Should have just put the original on the line-up and left it alone. It was their first break through hit and the original recording is really pretty. The original recording of ""Good Boys"" should have been put on there as well. I think the whole thing would be truly excellent had they done that. Otherwise, great collection for Blondie fans and the non alike!"
1,The subtitle is toilet reading,"Not as interesting as Go Phish, not as good photos as the Phish Book, not as intelligent as the Phish Manual, not as complete as the Phish Companion, and not as fun as Mike's Corner. It's the big name brand Phish book, so get it if you're a McDonald's kind of guy. But if you care what you're getting, pick one of the others."
5,Great Shoes,"A great shoe by Merrell, very comfortable,second time I've ordered them, and very quick service."
3,Product not as I expected,"Knit Fix by Lisa Kartus: Found it mostly a ""how to knit"" book. Illustrations very good. Some of the solutions were hard for me to grasp, but that may be ME!This has absolutely nothing to do with the seller. Everything as said. Prompt, efficient service. Very pleased."
3,Some are Most helpful,This book provided some solutions for knitting errors that I have come across in my knitting work over the years. Obviously my fixes never looked as good as some of these solutions.
5,Incredible,"At first, this books seems to be just a fanatical ""save the environment"" apocalypse story, but as the story develops, the reader is quickly brought into a deeply engaging and beautiful story set in such an apocalypse. While the undercurrents do tend to preach harmony with nature, the true focus of the story is always the title character, though other characters, particularly the villians -who, as in most Miyazaki works, are not absolutely evil and have understandable motivations and emotions- may borrow the spotlight for a few scenes.As literature, it is the finest this medium has ever produced. It is not easy for a comic book to gain recognition, but if any one ever deserved it, it would be Nausicaa."
4,A Fantastic Metaphor of Our Own Era with a Good Message!,"Not only is Nausicaa one of the best manga titles out there, it also managed to capture the essence of a fantasy that resonates our own era.The story easily mimics the environmental problems of our days, where human civilization gets its comeuppance from mother nature. The girl Nausicaa represents the very few of us who still care for the crying world ecosystems."
2,THE MAGIC IS GONE,"Unfortunately, this falls under the heading of ""band gets back together, but cannot recreate what they once had."" Without some of their original members, including the founder, it's easy to see why. I'm not saying this is really bad pop-rock, but as a FATE fan, I was expecting more, especially after the encouraging bonus tracks on their old cd re-releases.If you're a FATE fan, then heed my review. If not, it might be a bit expensive to make such a blind purchase."
5,Powerful book,"This is a great inspiration to me, though I am not catholic.Her words are uplifting and healing."
2,Not what I was hoping,"I gave the product 2 stars because living in a warm weather climate but having a small backyard I was looking forward to the portability and hopefully the sturdiness of the product. Unfortunately, as some might be able to read on the Target related reviews of the same product here, I weigh about 185,6ft ""normal"" guy and was quickly sinking to where I could basically feel the support poles every time. Unfortunately what would have been perhaps a 4 star comment later on became a 2 because my father laid down to relax, and he weights perhaps 200-210 max and the support structure completely ripped through, and he could have injured himself pretty badly. So I guess it's really the luck of the draw and I might risk myself at purchasing one again but through a brick and mortar store to be sure it can be returned."
5,Very good,"This is great product. It fits so well on my zen v I forgot that it wasn't part of the zen v itself. The armband works very well and is comfortable. Not as comforatable as my ipod shuffle armband (made by ipod) but it was at least $10 cheaper. I'd like it if it came in white, but that's nit picky.Overall, very good product. Would certainly buy again."
1,Maybe I'm a masochist but...,"I kept waiting for the bad, awful thing that happens to her after she has one drink and am still waiting. This book is a teen whine-fest about school, friends, and boyfriends. The entire book is a setup to the ""bad thing"" that supposedly happens..and then it actually doesn't happen. This is kind of of like watching the movie Titanic, except the officers are able to avert disaster, learn an important lesson, and everyone goes home happy. Not impressed. I know it's a teen book, but I would have enjoyed this more if the girl's life had been ruined and we get to read about how she actually deals with it."
4,Not exciting but a Good read,When beginning this novel I was excited considering it was written by Niki Burnham. After a while I began to wonder when the excitement was to going to begin. For a bit it just seemed to drag on but once the ending came it all made sense. I thank Niki Burnham on writing this novel. I think it has a very important message with it. I encourage all girls to give this book a read. See what you get out of it.
3,Fairly Decent,"I love teen books. This book was pretty good. I completed it in a day. But, it took a while to start off the book and only became interesting toward the end. The issue that the whole book is about takes place during the end, which isn't the smartes way to go. Anyway, it is about a 17 year old girl, named Jenna. She is very smart and gets accepted into an ivy-legue school. She is also very pretty and semi-popular. Her boyfriend is a very hot jock. But she is very insecure and gets pressured into have sex."
5,Absolutely beautiful interpretation of classics,"I remembered my mom mentioned liking Nana Mouskouri once and purchased a concert DVD and a couple CDs (including this) for her birthday.She said it was the best gift ever and couldn't be more grateful.I went to visit her a couple weeks ago and she got me in her car to listen this record at a decent volume... WOW! beside those BMWs have really nice sound systems, Nana's voice is incredible...Thanks for an unforgettable experience Nana!PS. Got the music on my iPod already."
5,A Must Have Book,If you are a poultry lover; this book is a must. Invaluable information and pictures.
4,Great 4-H help.,My county is using this book with our 4-H Poultry project. It is great and very helpful for the kids and their parents.
3,Magnum break-in not good,This is probably the 15th pair of magnums I have owned in the last 10 years and never had a pair so hard to get broken in. I'm gonna give them a few more days then I'll just have to send them back for another type. Love magnum boots this just might be a bad pair.
4,Auto Meter 2173 60 psi Pressure Gauge,"I plan to use for oil pressure on a older H-D. The V-twin rarely has pressure above 30 psi even when cold so the 60 psi gauge is a good choice. But this gauge does NOT have the ""Red and green light bulb for custom night driving look"" and no internal provision for lighting."
2,Wrong Item,"I did not receive the Cables To go unit. I was sent another type of unit that was very similar and it sent a voltage down the line that damaged my DVD/Hard Drive Recorder. I sent the unit back. I can not say anything about the Cables To Go, but I wish I had received the unit that I ordered. The one that I received was a cheaper unit than the Cables To Go"
2,Left much to be desired.,"I don't think that this book delivers.I have purchased many Repair manuals in the past from Haynes. They have been all car manuals though. These manuals always seemed to have plenty of instructional information, and a great troubleshooting section. This book had neither. Some of the good things in the manual are some of the specifications that it has for the bike, Tire pressure, Spark Plug gap and type, things of that nature. But I Imagine if you had the owners manual you would already have that info. However I think that the book is too technical for the regular owners."
2,Written in the queen's English.,"Initially, I was thrilled that we were getting a Haynes shop manual to help us rebuild a few items on our 1981 Honda CB750C. However, when we got it, we found it difficult to read. Yes, it's written in English... the queen's English. I have parts like a gas/fuel tank, pet cock, and screen. This book has a petrol tank, gauze filter, and speaks of loosening from nubs. By far, I'm not a professional mechanic, but I can figure it out. The British English is an added stress that I didn't need!MAKE SURE you're getting a copy in American English!"
2,Eartha Global Explorer Inferior to Original Global Explorer,"DeLorme's Eartha Global Explorer 1.0 is not at all like its predecessor, Global Explorer 1.0. The original Global Explorer had street maps of the world's great cities, with detailed descriptions of famous landmarks, like a wonderful tour of the world. The new 'Eartha' Global Explorer has none of those features and seems to be nothing more than a crude attempt at an annotated 3-D atlas of the world, viewed from afar. I tried to order the original Global Explorer, without success."
5,Continuum Mechanics,I have found this book to be inciteful and helpful in covering Continuum Mechanics material. It is a great building block to start with.
3,not as good as expected,"This book is a little disapointing to me - doesn't have as many ideas that get my creative juices going as I'd hoped. Good concepts though and for someone who is a beginner at journaling and creative expression, will be a good intro. I will use it as a resource for those taking classes from me in the future."
5,just as expected,Does just what it is supposed to do. Packing and shipping was 100%. Product was in perfect condition when it arrived.
2,Book cutting is screwed up,"I haven't read this book yet, but when I received it, it was a new book, but the way it was cut, all the pages were slanted and I believe it must have been crooked on the cutting press because it shredded the pages and they are not only at a slant, but they are stuck together. I have no comment on the content of the book because I haven't been motivated to read it due to the condition it came in. I should have returned it, but I haven't had time. Fortunately, it looks like the content is still there, so hopefully, it is readable! Not very happy though!"
4,Good resource,"This is the first book I've read by Ms Somers. I found it very informative and an excellent resource. Some of her writing at first is a bit repetative, hence the four stars, but I liked the recap at the end of the chapters. I have read other books on the subject and found hers easy to read. I especially like that she gives personal examples in her own life as it is important to know she is speaking from experience. I very much appreciate her being an advocate for this important subject. As a result I have undergone the testing and found answers to some health issues that I have been suffering with. I am delighted to know that there are some improvements that can be made with BHRT and look forward to pursuing it."
1,"Interesting info, but her personal rants are out of line!","Somers does a nice job of compiling valuable information, and she clearly states her lack of medical expertise. What bothered me was her strange preaching of a conservative agenda, which was completely out of place. She consistently bashes feminism & feminists by name, blaming this ""modern movement"" for the state of women's health. She repeats over & over how we need to have lots of babies, breastfeed, skip birth control [no thanks, Suzanne, that was the life of my short-lived elders]. She praises the health habits of Bush, while damning Bill Clinton; she even manages to mention Monica! What is going on here? Is she planning on running for office? The vegetarian rant was also weird. Lastly, I had a hard time reconciling her preventive prehysterectomy with her claims of safety.Overall, I had a hard time taking her seriously."
5,this book is about to change my life,"I wish I'd known aout this book years ago.This is the first I've heard of Bioidentical Hormone replacement.I think every woman should read this book, or at least research bioidentical hormone replacemtnt.Thank you Suzanne Somers!!Liz EppsMadison, AL"
4,cool advice and info,this book has good bkgrd info on these health issues for men as well as women and good interviews with docs.the info about various degrees of hormone replacement therapy is made understandable to ordinary folk like myself.
5,second only to my bible!,i found out about this book through some research on anti-aging medicine. it was highly recommended by the american college of anti-aging medicine website. it is very informative and i highly recommend it!
5,Happy With Indiana Jones,"I received my Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade within decent time. I watched the DVD and it was excellent, no scratches! The box was in good condition also. Thanks!"
2,Age of Tegaderm,Not sure these were recently made or had not been stored improperly . The adhesive didn't seem to be 100% therefore they didn't stay on as long as intended. Considered asking for a refund.
5,Excellent product,"Barely any taste though it doesn't completely dissolve... then again, i have yet to buy any glutamine powder that dissolves 100%. I take this 3x/day and it really helps w/ muscle soreness."
4,Nikon speed light stand.,In general it is a good stand for use with my Nikon speedlite and I recommend this product to all who prefer to use the lighting away from the camera.
4,Slow Becoming Bright,Good price and very similar to warm incandescent light. Takes too long to reach maximum brightness though. This is not necessarily an inherent trait with CFL technology as the TCP brand is close to instant brightness.
2,Good hub. But no support for updating dock adapters,"This is a good USB 2.0 hub. The inclusion of an ipod dock is handy but there is a drawback. Belkin has made the dock incompatible with the Apple dock adapters so you cannot use a plastic Apple dock adapter for newer iPods and the iPhone with this hub.This would not be a problem if Belkin would release new plastic dock insets to match newer iPods and the iPhone. Unfortunately, after several emails and phone calls to Belkin tech support the final answer is that Belkin will not be releasing plastic dock adapters for more recent iPod and iPhone models."
2,Doesn't seem well made,"These snow shoes arrived promptly as promised, which is what I've always experienced with Amazon orders. However, a strap broke when my husband was just fitting them in our living room once they arrived. The materials seem ""cheap"", although the bag to carry them is pretty cool, featuring ""backpack"" type shoulder straps. Not the quality I was expecting. Unfortunately, it's been a ""dry"" winter in Denver, and we haven't had a chance to use them yet."
3,The Belmonts without Dion....lead singer Carlo,"ZIf you like Dion's solo works or Teenager In Love then tracks 1,2,4,8,9,13 and 22 are for you. They are all soundalikes of that ""Dion Sound"" and are the best tracks on this cd. The other tracks are slow ballady types, a couple country sounding songs! But this cd is worth every penny...the sound quality is great...almost all tracks in stereo...and with the great voice of Carlo Mastrelango(cousin of Johnny Maestro of the Crests) Also if you like this sound, pick up the Ace Cd ""Carlo and the Belmonts""(avalible on Amazon) for the great track Little Orphan Girl...great solo song by Carlo featuring a group known as The Tremonts(became the Elegants a few years later).Anyway.......this is a good cd and you should buy it if you are a Dion fan"
2,"Good Ergonomics, but no Precision","I expected this mouse to be as/or more precise then the optical explorer mouse I had from Microsoft. Once the MS mouse stopped working correctly. I bought this mouse. I have to say it fits my hand perfectly, but has many bugs. It will for instance: not record slight movements in opposite directions correctly, will sometimes just stop working only to start working 5 seconds later.It's so buggy and it's not even funny. Save yourself the money. I installed / reinstalled drives, checked-rechecked, read-reread manuals. It still works like crap. Please buy another mouse then this."
4,Feedback on Ipod Nano Bluetooth Adaptor,Good product. Works very well. Only negative is that the battery charge in the Ipod runs down rapidly.
4,I didn't like it as well asw 'Incoroprated Knight'...,... but my son liked it better.Equally well written & funny;I just liked 'Knight' better.As the two books won't set you back much I recommend getting them both.
1,Junk,"If the only movie you want in this box is Black Mask then its good times, Bloodsport 4 was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and the disc that says Kick Boxer 1&2 on it actually has 2 junk foreign movies I felt so ripped off when I got it DON'T BUY THIS"
4,ANOTHER GREAT FOXTROT COLLECTION,"It seems i am not alone in the opinion that when Bill Watterson ended his run on Calvin & Hobbes that Foxtrot became the defacto new favorite of many comic strip fans and with good reason. Bill Amend has the two qualities that make a great cartoonist: First, a comical yet adept cartooning style and second: a very witty sense of humor. The Fox Family consists of Mom Andy, Dad Roger, sons Peter and Jason, and Daughter Paige. This cast tackles the situations that all families do in funny and often eccentric ways led by the brainy and altogether greedy youngest son Jason.Foxtrot consistently has some of the best Thanksgiving and Christmas strips every year and I always look forward to those. This is a strip that should be turned into a TV show! It's far superior to the lame ""Family Guy""."
5,BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!,"This CD will not leave my ears, I sing it in the shower and at school and if that isn't good enough then just go listen to it yourself."
4,"Nice watch, but could use some improvements","The watch is nice, solid and easy to see in low light conditions. A few drawbacks however are the faint alarm that can barely be heard and the lack of a clear indicator of zero on the bezel. The bezel says '60' in the same size and font as the rest of the dial's numbers. I may just scratch an arrow here to speed time settings. Overall, I enjoy the watch and it looks sharp both under and above water but would like to see some improvements. I ended purchasing a stainless steel band for it and after modifying the band to fit the unsual watch body in a machine shop, it looks much nicer than the rubber one it's shipped with. I also removed the bezel and machined out a notch right above the '60' on the dial, giving the bezel a 'tactile' feel so I can know where zero is."
2,a bummer of a birthday present,"I am currently sending this watch back to Freestyle. I'm hoping that it is covered under the warranty. This is supposed to be a dive watch for up to 200 meters. Well.... it didn't last one ""dive"" in our swimming pool. It now has condensation in it that comes and goes, but is very disappointing!"
4,A classic,"Written originally in dutch in 1919 (the first english translation appeared in 1924), this is a classic of medieval historiography. Huizinga's main thesis goes something like this: the black death of the late 1340s, which decimated European population, brought as a result a morbid sensibility to European culture. It meant also a return to religion, as the cult and veneration of saints grew enormously during the last half of the 13th century and throughout the 14th century. This would bring in excesses of its own, and would lead the way for the reformation of the 15th century to counter it. But the book is more than just the lay out of this thesis, as Huizinga show us the daily life and thoughts of the late middle ages (based mostly from french and flemish sources) in a very vivid way."
4,Zamfir music,"Overall satisfied, though it is not that much my type of music. The CD arrived on time and in perfect condition."
1,"Anymore shallow, i'd be a cheerleader","I have never read a more racist, dismal and irrational response to the question of gender. Connell goes on (and on) about the symptoms of the problem without actually addressing the cause. Much word over nothing, me thinks."
2,Disapointing,This CD is poorly recorded and I DO NOT beleive that these are the original artists. I am not sure how the label got around listing the artists and even having some of their pictures on the front cover. I should have known by the price of the CD so shame on me for not being more careful. Shame on them for misleading customers.
4,Decent,It's a sturdy table and is easy to assemble. I was disappointed that it only comes half way across the bed for the patient to eat. Fix the dimentions and it's a winner.
5,"Great quality, service, and price","I ordered this table on Monday evening, standard delivery, and it arrived Wednesday mid-morning! Amazing!Assembly time was 5 or 10 minutes. The quality of this table is every bit as good as one for which the local home medical equipment supplier would have charged more than double the price! Needless to say, I am very pleased with this entire transaction."
4,Functional,"This is not going to win any decorating awards, but its not bad either. It looks exactly as pictured, and my husband put it together in minutes. It's very sturdy, the wheels roll smoothly, and it raises high enough to accommodate sitting in my VERY high bed. For $50 you can't beat it."
2,"Seems fine, but doesn't extend to the full 45 inches stated in the product description","The table seems fine for its purpose, and it was easy to assemble, but the product description says it extends to 45 inches. Really? 39.5 inches is as high as I can get it. Unless I made a mistake assembling it, this is as high as it will go. So I'm disappointed. Buyers should be able to rely on a product description for accurate information. I'm not there to examine it, so how else am I going to know how it will perform (apart from the reviews)?I wanted a table that extends to 45 inches as promised. Instead, I got a table that only extends to 39.5 inches. Not happy!"
3,Over Bed Table,The table would be great for the price if it didn't raise up (adjust) at the slightest movement anywhere on it. It can't be rolled around without it raising up on its own. Otherwise it is sturdy and roomy.
4,Over bed table was what we ordered.,"This arrived just as promised, was in good shape went it arrived, but it turned out to be something we no longer needed, so we returned it. We had no problem with the return."
4,50 / 50,They sent the wrong table. I ordered this table for my Dad. He likes to eat in the living room so he can watch TV. I ordered the table with the offset base thinking it would provide more room for his feet and legs. They shipped the one with a centered base. I did not want to wait or bother with returning this item. Oh Well. I guess this one will work.
4,Great item- terrible instructions,"I purchased this item to use after a surgery. My husband complained that the instructions were very unclear. He had to basically figure it out for himself. The parts were badly made. The card with the different numbered parts on it did not correspond to the part needed per the instruction sheet. There were bolts and washers. The washers didn't fit ANY of the provided bolts. Now after my husband ""graciously"" assembled the tray, it was perfect for my needs and will be used for other purposes as well."
5,Hospital Over Bed Tray,"Nice simple product, easy to assemble, good price. Excellent for anyone who uses a hospital bed in their home and needs a convenient tray."
3,Great for the price,"Great for the price, but in shipment the laminate got a little chipped in 1 corner"
5,One of the best!,"Dont be fooled by the cover or title, this is a hilarious comedy anime, been a while since i been so charmed by a Anime, truly amazing, highly recommended."
2,Bluray discs is subbtitled locked,"In Fandom Report's recent article it was discovered that in the Bluray disks are subbtitled locked, keep this in mind when you by this.Here's the link [ ... ]"
5,great for runners,"I am a marathon runner suffering from tight hips on long runs. This DVD was recommended by a yoga teacher friend, and the exercises/poses shown have been great for relieving my hip tightness and strain on 18+ mile runs. Well worth it."
2,Descent Story Arc,"I like the idea of incorporating other characters in the expanded universe, such as Hett, The Dark Woman, and Aurra Sing. However, where is this story going?The art was descent and the writing was kind of abbreviated. This story was kind of short as well."
5,KAUFMAN IS KING!!!,"LLOYD 'THE KING' KAUFMAN IS THE REIGNING KING OF INDEPENDENT CINEMA....BEING A FILMMKER MYSELF, THIS BOOK [AND IT'S COMPANION 'MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE']HAS HELPED ME AVOID THE LANDMINES IN MAKING MY OWN FEATURE FILMS...KAUFMAN'S FOLKSY [FOR A NEW YORKER], IRREVERENT STYLE IN TEACHING, WILL HELP EVEN THE NON-SCHOLARLLY TYPES UNDERSTAND THIS BUSINESS WE CALL SHOW!WHETHER YOU ARE A FILM-FAN OR FILMMAKER, THIS IS [AND IT'S COMPANION 'MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE']THE BEST BOOK BOOK OF IT'S KIND!EDUCATIONAL & ENJOYBLE!IT HELPED ME BECOME ESTABLISHED...IT MIGHT HELP YOU, YOUNG SPIELBERG!-TONY WATT, FILMMMAKER/ACTORC/O TONY WATT INC., STUDIOS & TWISTED SINEMA [TONYWATT.COM] MEDIA"
5,Troma is the king B-Movies,"What fun to read how the movies came about. To get some background and antedotes on the various really bad movies they make!If your not a Troma fan, run out and rent one. The movies are a wonderful way to spend a raucous evening with friends and popcorn."
2,The same as his other book,"Anyone considering purchasing this who has bought David Franson's other book ""2D Artwork and 3D Modelling for Game Artists"" should think again. This book is just a much smaller version of that. I bought them both, and I was quite disappointed that David would just blatantly copy his other work. There are a few different tutorials but it's not worth paying the price, get the other book instead."
4,sweet!,"Been using B&M products since the '70's. When I needed a converter, there was no question what brand I would buy. They are still the best."
3,Commercial compilation that doesn't represent her well.,"This collection is worth only for Mouskouri's version of Lonely shepherd,but besides that all other songs were used on other better collection (Passport,for instance).If you really want to enjoy from her ""Voice of lasting"" (As the Guinness encyclopedy for popular music defined her voice) you should get her original albums:Alone,Sings over & over etc.."
3,TOO MANY SMALL ONES,"Thought I was getting more usable sizes. While the price was good, only the orange and blue are useful in the garage. The 4 black ones are only useful on electronic type cords."
1,TRASH,"The New York Times put it the best when reviewing a new production of another opera at The Met: 'This is more about the director than Bellini'. This well sung (In french), if emotional empty production of Don Carlos, is laden with some of the most stupid ideas. Good singing by Vargas. Overall an embarrisingly piece of junk! And what about What's his name dress up like Mephistopheles?"
1,What a joke!,"I was just watching this opera and I'm sorry but I just couldn't continue watching it. I am also sorry for the singers and their efforts which were great but, the scenery and directions were all over the place. I didn't find it amusing at all. I also felt sorry for some of the audience members who even though they were smiling I could see in some faces their discomfort. You will hear a lot of booings and protest on this one! Which if I was there I most likely will do the same. :("
4,A entertaining read,"I had the seen the movie over 5 times before I decided to read the book, and let me tell you that even though I knew what was about to happen most of the time, I found it exponentially better than the movie. One of my favorites thus far."
1,Loathed this book.,"I bought this book based on appraisals of Mr. Thompson's works that drew rave reviews. I found this book sophomoric and rambling. I saw no point in the drug-infested antics and childish behavior by him and his lawyer friend even for hilarity value. It, unfortunately, did remind me of a time when all cops were called pigs and people in the military were viewed as scum as detailed in the book."
5,a strange and terrible journey into the worst of trips,"could anything possibly capture the mind-numbing terror and unexplainable enjoyment of an acid trip more than this novel? i haven't found anything yet. thompson drags us kicking and screaming with him to the edge of sanity as raoul duke and dr. gonzo subject themselves to the worst kinds of torture. i found myself often white-knuckled. fear and loathing is a quick read, taking me between 4 and 5 hours over 2 sittings to finish. if i could give it more than five stars, i would. paul death"
3,A Little Too Over-the-Top,"Given all the hype about Hunter Thompson and ""gonzo journalism"", I had high expectations for this book. Unfortunately, they were not met. I suppose I was waiting for some Big Ideas or Transcendental Truths from this book. All I found was a spastic story about two drug addicts, stoned out of their minds and with way too much money, acting ridiculous in Las Vegas. The interactions between the main characters and the denizens of Vegas were this book's only redeeming quality; it's quite humorous watching hotel staff, waitresses, valets, and other guests eat up the craziness that Thompson and his attorney/partner in crime dish out. Most, if not all, of them accepted even the most outlandish behavior from Thompson as simply what is expected from visitors to Vegas.Way too much drug use, vomiting, and lost realism to appeal to me. Maybe the movie is better, but somehow I doubt it."
5,Great Ride,Read this book in two days. I've been on a biography binge about people with strange and twisted lives. This book fits right in. From the first page you can tell your going to be in for a wild ride. Thompson tells his story in a way that enables you to understand what life is like on a major drug and alcohol bender. It's probably not for everyone but if you like stories about living life on the edge this one's for you. I laughed all the way through and at the end thought... how sad. Anyway it's a fun and easy read. Can't wait to get the rest of his books.
5,Extremely funny surreal and serious. True gonzo genius.,"Since I first read this marvellous book way back then I musthave bought it 20 times and passed it on. When feeling lowopening this book and reading any chapter is guaranteed to make me laugh,think and raise my spirits all in one go.Ranks with Catch-22 as one of the best books of the era."
3,A wild ride,I didn't think I would like this book because I'm not that interested in 1960s culture or anything. But it is an entertaining book. I'm not sure how relevant it is to a general reader today. Thompson seems to have had something important to say in this book. I'm just not sure I got it.
2,Poor read,"Poor plot, unnecessary ramblings. Potentially interesting drug stories described by a man with a rich vocabulary and nothing else. It didn't keep me interested and I felt like I was dragging my feet everytime I turned a page. I found myself looking for perhaps something deeper and more profound in the book. Instead, I found more stories about mescaline and stupid drug-inpired ramblings."
5,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"The book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was what my son was looking for, so it was with complete confidence that I went to Amazon to search, It was easy to find, easy to purchase and the shipping was quick and simple. My son is enjoying the escapades of Hunter S. Thompson and I am extremely pleased with the ease of purchasing the book through Amazon."
4,Groovy,I read this book years ago. Like everything else from the 60's that seemed hip and inspirational back then....it now seems dated and ridiculous. Reading it is kinda like watching a black and white movie that is suppose to be a classic but just seems old.
4,Funny but where is it going?,"The book is very funny and enthralling, but I expected it to have a terminal goal.This book was one of the funniest books I have ever read. I would have a group of people looking at me constantly and people asking me what I was reading. They were all wondering what book could make me laugh so much. I have read it a half a dozen times.The book is unfortunately very deep and hard to follow on the subliminal message. Thompson will capitalize certain words to mean something but never even leave a hint as to what they mean. Often I would find myself thinking about what he means. When you finish the book you wonder what he wrote it for. I can to some degree understand what he was saying about the American Dream and drugs, but this came from within and wasn't truly sparked by the book."
4,Ways Not to Lose is NO LOSER,"Some great songs, delivered in a low-key but satisfying and convincing way. Enjoyable right away, but grows on you with repeated listening."
4,"Good source of fashion, bad source of photos.","You know, I'm glad that I bought the book and I have to say, It was really better than I had expected. It does have some really nice illustrations (that you may have seen around the internet) that detail the skinhead fashion particular to the year. It is the best source I've seen yet on the early skinhead style.The unfortunate thing is that contrary to the illustrations, the photos seem to be more often of the mid 70's and early 80's, and rarely of the earlier 60's skinhead fashion that I had hoped for. Most of the skins in these photos are in jeans, and not a lot of the dressier ""hard mod"" side of things. As mentioned in another review there are unfortunately several racist ""sieg heil"" photos, and only one black skinhead photo. And let's face it, I think in a skinhead book we all want to see some black skinheads."
4,Knight gives a good introduction to the culture.,"Nick Knight's book Skinhead gives the reader a good first introduction to the skinhead culture. In an overview of the origins of skinheads, Knight is able to bring in the style and ideology which embodies a skinhead. He distinguishes between the different types of skinheads - racist and non-racist - and gives history on their mixing.This book includes a good music guide which describes the Jamaican birth of ska and it's immigration to England in the 1960's. There is also an illistrated fashion section which in itself will justify for some the purchase of this book. In conclusion Knight gives a wonderful photo album of skinheads which shouldn't be missed. Although not as detailed as Spirit of '69: a Skinhead Bible, by George Marshall, this is a good book to give an quick picture of a youth sub-cultured misunderstood for far too long."
4,Review of Alvitum Phase 1,"This product has a great fruit punch taste. It is much better than having to swallow a handful of pills. It doesn't dissolve as good as it could, but I find this a minor annoyance.Since I started taking Alvitum Phase 1, I feel I have more energy throughout the day. I will continue to purchase this product, and I think you will like it too."
2,"Ugly, unmusical, dark-sound trem.","On a whim, I bought a Stereo Pulsar and was extremely disappointed to plug it in. The sound is dark, ugly, and sounds like a blanket was thrown over the amp.At first I thought maybe it was just the amp/guitar, so I have tried it through 1966 blackface Vibrolux Reverb, 1954 Fender Pro, and 1994 Mesa/Boogie Mark IV combos, playing a 1954 Tele, a 1965 SG Jr., and a new Johnny Marr Jaguar. None of my amps or single-coils could get it to brighten up to acceptable levels.I am shocked at how many good reviews this thing gets. I am looking for the first opportunity to trade it away on TGP."
4,hooked after 3 listens,"On first listen I was a little taken back with the reggae vibe that seems to permeate every other song on this album. But the songs themselves are as always, fantastic. And after a few listens I've grown to love the reggae influence. They definitely do it their own way. There are, as always, a few new classics here such as ""Dead Man's Eyes"", ""NYC"", ""blackened blue eyes"", and ""Muddy Ground"". If it sounds a little odd to you at first....do yourself a favour and give it a few spins before making up your mind."
5,Great,This set is perfect. The onlt thing I would add is a garment bag. Worth the price and very happy with the company. Would buy again.
3,can be used for only several trips,"besides its low price, this luggage set has nothing to be praised.the size of every case is smaller than the nomal ones, cheap construction. I am not sure how many time's international trip it can survive."
5,POWERFUL VOICE!,"DENINE HAS TO BE BE ONE OF THE BEST IN FREESTYLE! THIS CD IS FULL OF DANCING,ENERGY..AN EXPLOSION IN FREESTYLE. ALSO CHECK OUT, STEPHANIE MARANO--SYMPHONY OF LOVE & LISSETTE MELENDEZ ""IMAGINATION""OTHER GREAT FREESTYLE CDS...AND OF COURSE JUDY TORRES""LOVE STORY""A COMPLETE COLLECTION!"
4,A good book if your interested in Ducati History,The book is for you if you're interested in the history and development of Ducati's from one model to the next. It also has a fair amount of technical information about how each model varies from the next. What I didn't like was that it had only a few color photos and very little information on more recent models (1995 and up)....
5,"Stunts,jumps,cheers/chants,tumbling,pyramids and more!","The All-new Cheerleaders Handbook gives many pages of information for any coach(or sponsor/advisor),cheerleader,cheer squad,or anyone who wants to know about cheerleading. Great resource for captains,coaches and cheerleading instructors."
2,Good print of a forgettable film,"To me, it is surprising that anyone would bother to re-master this movie. Although the result is a print that looks quite first rate, the movie itself is thoroughly forgettable. It is a routine, low-key crime story with bland actors. Even the villains are non-descript. And it is marred with far too much ""comedy relief"", especially because the theory of comedy here is ""idiots are funny"". It does not even convey much sense of the time in which it was made. Except for the cars being driven, it might well be a 1950's TV production.It does have one claim to fame though: it re-unites the team of Louis J. Gasnier, George A. Hirliman, Lawrence Meade, and Sam Diege, who had pooled their mighty talents to create the immortal ""Reefer Madness"" in 1936! Unfortunately, no trace of the insanity that permeates that production is present in this one."
1,Beetles for You and Baby?!,"This product contains carmine color, also known as cochineal extract. This sounds innocuous enough, but do you know what it is? BEETLES. Yes, crushed beetle extract. Cochineal is a nice way of saying crushed female cactus beetles.It makes absolutely no sense for the manufacturer to add this non-nutritive, potentially dangerous substance to a product for pregnant women. Not only does adding carmine (beetle) extract render the product non-kosher and non-vegetarian , it causes severe allergic reactions in some people. (Please visit the FDA website for more information.) The 'yuck' factor alone is enough to turn those seeking a DHA supplement away in disgust.Mashed beetles with that DHA for you and your baby, mom-to-be? No thank you!"
3,Good item,I bought this as I was learning amount having emergency items. It covers several items but I am finding it would need to be used with other books to have your complete preparedness information.
5,Handy little pump works like a charm and the price is right.,"This pump works great and I've had no difficulties pumping up my tires with it. I've had this pump for over 2 years and I've gotten quite a few minor flats out on trails and even commuting in city streets. Pump still works like new. I have a mountain bike with 26"" tires and they're pretty damn thick (2.5""). So the folks who said this pump was ""hard"" are either weaklings or my forearm is just extra buff from all the... well, that's not the point. The point is, this pump is very compact (only 10"" in length with handle pushed in) and it pumps air while both pushing and pulling the pump handle so it's fast! I didn't use the mount that came with this pump for my bike. Whenever I'm biking I have a backpack with my lock, drinks, wallet/ID, Green Slime, etc. and the pump fits in my pack nicely;it practically weighs nothing at all. I highly recommend this little pump!"
3,"Great Pump, Cheap Attachment!","This pump has been there when I needed it, but that is more than I can say for the attachment piece that goes on the bike. This piece broke during the first week of use while simply riding my bike around town. Have a backup plan on where to place the pump just in case you experience the same."
1,Relentless tedious action and dull human characters,"for all practical purposes this movie is really no more than one long chase scene that hits you over the head with a bunch of gun fire and car crashes with drab human characters (""Lincoln"" and ""Jordan"") at the center of it all.your pretty much killing time watching this."
3,It reminded me of a 70's sci fi film,This movie reminded me of a 70's sci fi film like Login's run and amny other films. This movie was good but will be forgoten fast and we'll watch it in 10 years thinking this was cheasey just like 70's sci fi films. The movie was a bomb in the box office and I can see why but the film is pretty good it's not great but it's good. The story is good and original but it's why to long. The acting is ok but not great and the chase/action scene's are why to long.
3,Is too much action possible?,"This thing is very noisy and the action, after a slow opening, is almost non-stop car chases, crashes, explosions, building collapses etc etc. After awhile, it all begins to look the same. And sound the same. Also, at 2 hours and 10 minutes, this is about 40 minutes too long to tell its story, which is rather simple. There is nothing to justify the length, other than, perhaps, the director's reluctance to leave yet more noise on the cutting room floor. At least ScarJo is something to look at. But why is Djimon Hounsou always dripping, just dripping, with sweat dripping offf his bald head, while no one else is? Hmm?"
3,Craptacular,"Definition of:Craptacular (adj) Having all the elements to be spectacular, but still fails to be so.Pros:Great cast of characters, interesting story concept, and of course great sets and action.Cons:Excessive product placements to the point of annoying.Excessive and pointless action scenes, so over the top to be unbelieveable or entertaining unless of course you are 15.Target audience is the teen crowd (15), in other words the plot and dialog are pretty weak."
3,Not As Good As I Remember,"I haven't seen Logan's Run for many years, but from what I recall it was much better than this.1st hour - remake of LR, and a pretty good reconstruction.2nd hour - chase scenes followed by more chase scenes. If you like meaningless, unrealistic car chases, where the good guys escape by the skin of their teeth, over and over, but no-one cares how many innocent bystanders are killed (or do they all suffer miraculous escapes too!), then this bit is for you.Ending - Just predictably silly. (People who have been brainwashed into believing that the outside world is contaminated, go running outside when a hole appears .. yep!)Ok, if you know the story of LR then the plot is no surprise. (Actually, even if you don't it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what's coming.)Oh, and Jenny Agutter was more sexy.Thinking about it, make that 2 and 1/2 *s."
5,Good Movie,I never hear of this Movie Befor.but one dayI sew it' some where.and I like it'so I buy it
2,Why I didn't walk out of this movie,"There's only one thing that kept me from walking out on this movie: the fact that I was on an airplane at the time. I elected instead to read a book, while keeping the earphones on to see if I could catalog the complete set of sci-fi cliches:* White-decor utopian future, like THX-1138: check* Highly monitored, like The Truman Show (and THX-1138): check* Thought control of inhabitants through inspirational sayings, like 1984: check* Comatose people in vats of liquid, like The Matrix and Minority Report: check* Misfit feels he doesn't fit in, like most of the above: check* Realization that people are being used for an evil purpose, like Soylent Green: checkI did like Steve Buscemi, and since I didn't turn off the headphones I'd have to give it more than one star, but if you've seen any of the movies listed above, you can safely skip this one."
4,:0),"great action pack movie not what i expected, it has some similar patterns to other movies i've seen but i think they did a good job"
3,Good video/audio...no frills release,"I love this M-Bay movie. The blu-ray transfer is good, and HD audio sounds nice! No extra's, same as DVD release. To bad, but I wanted this in HD and it finally came out! Cheap for the price!Enjoy!"
3,Winning the Lottery,"Suppose you found out that you are a clone. Then suppose you found out that the person who had you created needs your help. And giving your help means that you have to give up your life. Remember that the whole reason you even exist is because of that person who now needs your help. What would YOU do? I find it suprising how many people would say they choose to live. Even if that means another person dies. That's the premise for this movie.Ewen McGregor is starting to appear in way too many films. There's something called over-exposure. Scarlett Johansson is a star. An average film, nothing spectacular, mildly entertaining. I noticed a lot of corporate advertising in the movie, Puma, CK, Coke, etc., watch for it."
1,Michael Bay is a B-Grade director hiding behind a large buck,"Im sure when film companies have a large amount of money to spend and dont want to risk losing it, they call up Michael Bay. He is a sure thing for the cookie cutter movie type and is a blatent thief stealing other peoples ideas from other more original films. The highway chase scene in ""The Island"" is a blatent ripoff the the latest Matrix movie. ""Bad Boyz"" is a blatent rip-off of ""Beverly Hills cop"". ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" make me want to throw-up with the wishy-washy sentiments wrapped up in the flag where you just know, someone is gonna be saluting in the last scene of the film. There is nothing wrong with b-grade pictures when they are honest about what they are, but not when they pretend to be quality cinema with originality. Michael Bay would not know original if it bit him on the %@#&^*%$#!(* and anyone that pays to see his movies deserves them."
4,Almay Cleansing Lotion for Dry Skin,Ordered 2 each packagaes of 2. One bottle arrived broken. All the contents of the bottle were lost. Lotion was on all of the other items in the box.Need replacement bottle sent.
4,only apop i've purchased in full,Best apop album that i've heard so far... the only one i've purchased in its entirety.
2,Pretty disappointed...,"I have loved this band for years. When I first heard their ""Welcome to Earth"" Album in college I was entranced by the ethereal melodies and philosophical lyrics, along with the harder, more danceable tracks. I also really liked Harmonizer.However, even though I respect any musicians' desire to experiment and break out of ""their norm,"" I really felt like this album didn't showcase their talents at all. I found a lot of lyrics to be trite, and teenage-angsty, combined with uninteresting music. The one track I did like was ""Tuning In to the Frequency of Your Soul.""Maybe this 80s-pop style will never be a favorite of mine with ANY band and is just a matter of personal preference, but I thought what they did best was the darkwave electric/EBM/Synthpop that they did on their other albums. It really doesn't even sound like APB in my opinion. I really miss their old style!"
3,coulda been better,"I love Kiss. I have since I first heard them in 1977. There is really nothing wrong with this CD but, Kiss has put out a number of greatest hits/live albums thru the years. Here they added 2 new songs but, those songs are such a paint by the numbers Pop-rock stuff that killed off heavy rock in the 80's. I am a fan of a lot of the music from the 80's and kiss put out some really good music in the 80's but the two heard here(let's put the X in sex, Rock hard) are very stale and just filler to atract custumers nothing really stands out from either song. The song selection is very good from the back catalog.I feel it was a mistake to have Eric Carr sing Beth. I feel it was a slap in Peter Criss' face and an Insult to Eric Carr to have to sing a song from the past. Eric Was a great drummer and he can sing but he should have been on something els!"
3,Simple twist of Dylan,This is a pretty good collection of tunes. The copy I have also has the bonus disc with Queen Jane and The Mighty Quinn. The All Along The Watchtower is the one now available on Truckin' Up To Buffalo. It Takes Alot To Laugh features members of the Allman Brothers Band.
2,"well, it is better than the 1st one","Peretti gets his spiritual message across very well, thats about all he does though. It reminds me of the Roadrunner cartoons(which everyone beggins to hate after 2 or 3 episodes). Demon vs angel, angel kills demon, demon really wasnt as powerful as ypu thought or Peretti made out to be. The ""mystery"" part of this book was pretty neat, but please not another impossibly hard-to-get-out of situation that keeps the reader glued, and then destroys him when the captive is freed within a matter of seconds. Really, what trained assasin would stab himself in the ribs while holding a knife to somones neck?...The demon vs angel fights are boring, we already know what is going to happen (just like the roadrunner cartoons)..face it, these demons are going to be extinct if they try to take over one more town..maybe then I wont have to read these for my Bible class."
1,"Teaches Fear, Self Righteousness; Poorly Written","Initially I found this book far-fetched - not just in its treatment of Spirituality but in its knowledge of physical reality and human character. The characterization was poor and one dimensional. There is even a scene where a youth ""hopped up on marijuana"" robs a store to get money for more pot. I don't think Peretti has ever even met a stoner!Beyond the quality of writing issues, this book reinforces the fundamentalist belief that anything that we don't know is to be feared or hated. It speaks with the arrogance of self-righteous insulated Christian (not Christ-like) culture."
2,Perfect Title,"As the title says ""Nobody's Perfect"". It's just the record company trying to squeeze a few more dollars out of us die hard DP fans. Ian's voice is shot. I've seen the band since this release (without Ritchie) and Ian's voice is better then this album and Steve fills Ritchie's shoes nicely. The rest of the band has still got it. It just goes to prove that grey don't mean dead."
3,Great selection of tracks but ..,"What a mess on ""Woman from Tokyo""...why did they cut the song...hey, this is a classic from the band. I don't like the Gillan-Blackmore interaction on Strange kind of Woman...by far, the version on Made in Japan is really better. Also ""Lazy"" is played at a faster speed and it fades out Grrrrr! The editing is really bad, fades in ... fades out all the time. Like many others, I have complaint about this release but I keep it, there is some great moment ... but as the title is ...Nobody's perfect ! PS I have the single cd version !"
1,Book Good - Transition to Kindle for iPad Horrible,"The book material is good. However, the transition from textbook Kindle for iPad is horrible. You cannot read any of the charts and the text is unreadable, hard to follow is some parts. My husband even asked if I paid for the book or if it was free because it's so unreadable in some parts. It makes me afraid to purchase textbooks for my iPad in the future."
3,Avalon Sunset,The original songs on the CD were great. The bonus tracks not so much. One of the bonus tracks was a very poor rendition of one of the songs on the CD. Recommend getting the one with just the original tracks
5,Van Morrison,"I have a lot of his albums. I did not realize I bought a cassette, but it is great. He does Country Western well"
4,wish it was blue ray,"I searched for Blue ray and couldn't find it so had to settle with DVD. Our screen is 56"" so was alittle fuzzy. Disc also skipped in a couple of spots but only a few times. Definetly still worth buying, great songs."
4,Best of the Bastion Club,I think this is the best of the Bastion Club series so far. I liked the history between Charles and Penny and their realization that the thirteen years they spent apart made them into the people they were and therefore better suited for each other the second time around. Both of the main characters were strong and knew their own minds and there wasn't the usual overdone miscommunication between them that is usually present in romances. The spy plot of the book was okay but SL delivers on the steamy sex! I agree with the one reviewer who would like to see a book on Dalziel.
5,Love it,I find all of Stephanie Lauren's books fantastic. As soon as I finish one I am quickly looking for another.
2,"The genesis of the ""Black Legend"" of Spain","Interesting from a historical perspective, Fray de las Casas gives us the first look at the ""uniquely cruel"" Spanish stereotype that has been dubbed by historians as ""The Black Legend."" We can still see evidence of said legend in modern literature and movies. The book is the source of the oft-quoted figure of 20 million Native-Americans killed by conquistadors, including 3 million on Hispaniola (modern day Haiti and Dominican Republic) alone. Most modern historians agree that the island could have only supported a small fraction of that population. Extremely interesting book from the perspective of studying the history of public relations. This book was extensively used by the Dutch during their struggle for independence from Spain, being published in both Holland and England as a rallying point against, as one subtitle of the book put it ""the Bloudy and Popish nation of the Spaniards."""
4,"Dissapointed with spade style, returned for banana","Audiophiles seem to prefer the spade style, but I found that the slightest movement of the speaker cable will loosen the nut on the speaker binding post. I returned these connctors for the banana style of the same monster model, and am very happy with these."
1,Nearly useless,"These connectors are useless because they are so large! For any given pair of speaker posts, whether on my receiver, in-wall outlets or on the speakers themselves, it was a real trick to get the nut tightened and still keep the connectors from touching each other. For the receiver and the in-wall outlets, one pair of these connectors effectively knocked out four posts because they obstructed access to the adjacent pair."
1,Requires extra parts,should tell you that this requires 2-3 extra parts to use this... should be a package.
5,Compilation of Vangelis hits.,"This album is a compilation of Vangelis' various movie and album hits through the years. Included among previously unreleased soundtracks are the theme from 'Bladerunner', 'Missing' and 'The Bounty'. The most famous Vangelis theme, 'Chariots of Fire' is on this release as well. A wonderfully pleasant album, even in spite of the lack of continuity between most tracks."
2,This is not progressive muscle relaxation.,"I purchased this CD because I was looking for a Progressive Muscle Relaxation CD. Another reviewer stated that this was exactly that. I just received the CD today and tried it out. You can imagine my dissapointment when I realized it was not progressive muscle relaxation. (where you tighten then relax each muscle). I tried it out to see if I enjoyed it in it's own right. It was ok but not as useful as the PMR CDs -after much practice with PMR, you can train your self to relax just by making a fist!Anyway I hope this helps any of you looking for PMR. Don't buy this one."
3,A little too fast paced for mindfulness,"I liked the content of the CD and find Carolyn's voice to be very soothing. The middle of the tape, as she goes through each body part is very good and relaxing; but I found the beginning and end to be too fast - I wanted her to slow down her speech which is more conversational than meditative. OK, not great."
3,Beechwood Bakers Rack,The rack arrived in just a few days but was slightly disapointed in the quality control. I'm seeing more and more companies using several sections of wood to equal 1 length of board. I'm not a big fan of this method and disapointed that 1 leg was broken(or not glued) when it arrived. I gave it 3 stars because I was still able to use the rack even with the broken leg joint. If the rack would have arrived in 1 piece it would have recieved 5 stars. The rack is very sturdy as I have over 60 lbs of kitchen appliances on each shelf.
5,My personal favorite!,"On apersonal level, this is the most satisfying album JM has ever made. He wrote the most wonderful lyrics with absolutely beautiful songs. This is John's finest moment in storeytelling, even better that Scarecrow and The Lonesome Jubilee-classics in their own right. But he does something different here and I don't think I have ever figured it out, but it works. Don't miss the hidden track at the end of the album, it's worth the price of the album alone!"
4,"Stark, bleak, an honest portrait of JM in 1989","When I first got Big Daddy I was so dissapointed. After Four straight platnuim records, I expected Big Daddy to have the same intensity level of the previous Four. THis record was such a downer. However, I relized John was writing about the destruction of his second marrige to Vicky. I also thought, well, he's been advancing on each record from American Fool on, that the bubble's got to curst somewhere. But then I really listened. Even though he was singing in a lower key than the previous four records, it had an even greater intensity. I love the honesty of Void in my heart and pop singer. A must for all JM fans."
4,Great background and history,"The history and background of Zen as presented is excellent. I found it highly educational though somewhat difficult to follow at times. It just requires focused, concetrated reading. I was somewhat skeptical of the final section of the book, especially the Zen thoeries on economics. I thought that the author seemed to be stretching a bit to really get meaning from Zen philosophies and how they should apply to the modern world. But most of it was very good. Definitely worth some study time."
1,Waste of time and money,"I wanted an overview of the history of Islam. This book was a mistake. It is filled with academic jibberish that is unbelievable. Sentences that are longer than normal paragraphs, the introductions take more than 18% of the book, and the elitist bias is blatant. If you are the ""average Joe"", don't waste your money."
2,solid foundation; disjointed finish,"The book started off strong with detailed explanations of NPV, IRR, Sensitivity Analysis, and other tools of analysis. The later chapters, however, gave very weak and confusing explanations of options pricing and derivative securities. Chapter questions were poor - the answer key frequently provided incorrect answers.- Jeff Myers - Johns Hopkins University"
4,A moderately comprehensive guide for Students and Pros,"While not the most comprehensive volume on Corporate Finance, it nevertheless provides its readers with enough useful information to guide them through the intricate labyrinth of corporate finance. This book serves as a Finance 101 class for MBA students and as a refresher course for professionals."
4,Case closed,"Purchased for Nikon D80 and 18-200 lens. It does indeed fit, but it's VERY snug. Some difficulty getting camera out of case in a hurry, but the case itself seems well made and well padded. Wish it had a bit more room for filters."
3,HERE WE GO AGAIN..............,"Well, I have to say that this toy is very educational and my 3 1/2 year old loves it very much. She has learned alot from it also. I purchased this game for her for Christmas of 06 and here we are having to decide what to do next. It quit working....will not power up and when I do get it to come on it will not stay on. So, do I buy anyone because we have so many games? HELP!!!"
2,not satisfied,cuts on an offI thought it was a battery issue. Appears to have a short in the wiring.Have attempted to fix to no avail.
3,Very Disappointed,We received the toy brand new and the product did not turn on after several attempts with batteries. But Amazon Gave me a prompt full refund!!! Thank you amazon
4,Technical Book on Critical Thinking,A good overview of critial thinking. Fairly technical in nature this may not be a good choice for an introduction to the subject.
4,got tired feet?? then you need this!,"i stand up for over 8 hours at work every day and lately my ankles have been swelling. i saw this massager on the wendy williams show a few months ago. i took a pic of it and sent it to my hubby at work since he shops a lot on amazon and 2 weeks later, he surprised me with it.i use it every day so he won't get carpal tunnel from constantly massaging my tired feet. it's a little pricey, but worth every penny!! i use it barefoot or with socks on, but it works with shoes on too.it has two settings, although i've only used the higher one a few times, and it's pretty quiet and portable...it's just what the doctor ordered for tired achy feet."
1,"Seek elsewhere for cousel, civil or moral","This is an awful edition. There are absolutely no footnotes for Bacon's difficult and labyrinthine prose, no translations of his Latin quotations, as well as plain typographical errors. For instance, one of the more famous lines in essay 11 runs, ""All rising to great place is by a winding stair"" which this edition renders, ""All rising to great place is by a winding star."" A small error which completely obfuscates the sense of the passage. You are better off spending a little more for Bacon's Major Works from Oxford University Press, which has the complete Essays in it I believe, amongst many others."
2,better product on the market (Zen M),"the video quality is fair,lots of pixals, the sound quality is very good. The downfall of this product is its software no way to convert video files, I had to purchase 3rd party software $60 plus dollars. Archos 700 does not sync with windows media player 10 unless you use harddrive mode which does not convert files correctly. I paid way to much for this product wish I had not of purchased it. I just recently purchased Creative labs Zen M, for half the price and WOW what a product, Killer video and Audio, built in radio with radio recorder, and guess what it comes with its own software. I put 285 songs 185 photos and 16 full length movies in about 1 hour. The archos 700 has taken weeks to convert and configure video'sFinal Results:Don't buy the Archos 700 over priced and not ready for the market. Do buy the Creative Labs Zen M, Wow Wow and Wow what a great product."
5,Sweet Book,"I actually had a copy of this book, but I bought another copy because I wanted to make an It's A Wonderful Life poster for Christmas. It turned out great."
5,front entry bench,"This bench is a great deal for the price. Put together quickly- was missing one screw we had to buy- but otherwise has stood the test of a very busy front entryway- w/ kids, backpacks, etc."
2,WHY WASTE THE $$$???,"This collection isn't for the Rush fan, it is an incomplete (2112) introduction to their music. For that amount of money, go buy two or three of their late 70's/ early 80's discs and go from there...."
5,a must have for hardcore star trek fans and trekkies,this bookm seriously is amazing from the very begining to the very end!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i enjoyed this book alot its a fun and great read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"The title is a misnomer. The book covered 6 mos.,not 1 year.","I wondered if the intent of this novel was to explain how Kirk became Admiral, McCoy acquired his beard, and Spock went into his Kolinahr. If so, then the book achieved its purpose in 2 out of 3 ways--Kirk became Admiral after lots of convincing by Nogura, and Spock entered Kolinahr after experiencing lots of adventures. But how did McCoy decide to grow a beard--he looked good in it in the first few minutes of STTMP. The subplot involving the Romulans and the kidnapping negotiations was rather interesting, especially the stuff about the old wizard who possessed a Kolinahr's disciple's mind. I thought the fight between the wizard (or was it wa warlock?) and Spock's fiancee (she harbored the warlock's opponent) was great. All in all, a good novel, but it should have been renamed something else, like After the Five-Year Mission Ended..."
1,Not A Lot To Rave About,"""Falling For Mr. Wrong"" by Caroline Upcher is just another in a long line of female scorned - ""ohhh my life is [bad]"" --- ""I wish I could find a man to make me happy"" fiction that is taking over the country. Now - don't get me wrong -- I love ""chick lit"" (as it has become commonly known) but this didn't even live up to the ""chick"" part - much less the ""lit"" part.I found the main character and chief complainer Polly de Soto completely annoying and I will confess that I gave up at about chapter 18. I decided I had much better things to do with my time (consider that I recently got laid off from my job - so my time if pretty clear - doesn't that tell you something?) It's really not worth your time or money. There are many more interesting, romantic and telling stories out there. Check those out - there are many of us out there that have reviewed them. :) Cheers!"
5,THE FUNNIEST TV CARTOON OF ALL!,"If you were to ask me (in fact, some HAVE...YOU might) what I thought was the funniest made-for-TV cartoon, you might expect...oh...a Jay Ward thing...early H-B...Beany & Cecil? All fair guesses, but as much as I LOVE those cartoons, they would not be my answer.ROGER RAMJET would be. I really love it. It makes me--minimally---grin real big, AND (at least ONCE per episode) LAUGH OUT LOUD. I almost NEVER laugh out loud at ANYTHING.The characterisations are great, the voice acting is really great, and the writing overall is unbelievably great.It's been on a coupla DVD releases, but last night I bought the Deluxe Set. If you like funny cartoons, you should too."
1,"Horrible, buggy player","I've owned this player for a week now, and it's terribly buggy.It won't turn on if it's set to output in progressive scan. It has annoying 1/4 second audio drops if you watch a DTS movie. It's response time to buttons pushed on the panel or remote is miserable. The ergonomics of the remote is horrible. It's picture isn't that good: http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/cgi-bin/shootout.cgi?function=search&articles;=all&type;=&manufacturer;=1&maxprice;=0&deInt;=0&mpeg;=0#ToshibaSD-6915It'd be nice to have a working SACD/DVD-A/DVD-V changer, but this aint it."
1,They call this a 'changer'?,"Toshiba really created a more than lacklustre unit here. Just try to get it to play one CD then move on to the next one. When you play a disc, at the end it just stops. You MUST change to the next disc by pressing a button on the unit or the remote. The tech support admits that the unit was not designed to move from disc to disc except manually. You can do random play and get it to move from one disc to another, but that is the only way. In addition, you MUST have this unit connected to a TV at all times in order for anything to make sense. The cursor buttons do double duty, so for some functions you must press the menu button before pausing or stopping a CD in play. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. Just buy a single disc player, and you are better off."
2,Bleh,"The component outputs on my SD-6915 don't work. I've tried three different cables and... no component video.Worse yet, I bought my SD-6915 to be a high-res audio player, but it only plays DVD-Audio discs in Dolby Digital; I don't have the ""Advanced Resolution Surround"" options I should have for an DVD-Audio disks (and do have on my older DVD-Audio player).The remote the unit comes with is a crime against nature. The menu setup is obnoxious.On the plus side, it's just fine for playing SACDs. Which is something, I guess."
5,This is a potentially great DVD--But,"Nicely done by Simon & Garfunkel. The problem is that Amazon.com and some of its partners sell the PAL version--a format not targeted to most US DVD/Blu-Ray devices. I have two high end Blu-Ray players, neither of which can read the DVD. Fortunately, my computer is fairly forgiving. Unless you have a DVD player that is designed for both PAL and NTSC formats, you may be unable to play this DVD. And if you can, the picture quality is similar to VHS (although the sound quality is ok)."
4,Too much audience,"First, let me say that I've been an S&G fan since I first heard ""Sounds of Silence"" in the early 60s. For me, they were the only ones who equaled The Beatles in quality (if not quantity) of brilliant songs. I was hoping for a recording in a more intimate setting befitting their music. From the moment I heard the rowdy audience reception for ""Old friends,"" I knew this wasn't to be. It's Simon and Garfunkle, people, not ACDC! One reviewer claimed this DVD is better than the ""Central Park"" concert, but I disagree. I don't know if it was editing and production or a more respectful audience, but the ""Central Park"" concert seems vastly more intimate and satisfying. Don't get me wrong, if you're a fan you should purchase this DVD. S&G perform brilliantly, and it's a joy for this old timer to see them again 40 years later. I just think the rowdy audience spoils the mood of the music, and I wish a more appropriate venue had been chosen as a record of this historic reunion."
5,oscar bluemner:A passion for color,This is a wonderful book with an abundance of illustrations to go along with the text. I just recently learned of this artist and this book has supplied me with a knowledge of him and his influences. It also shows well his emerging style as he makes the shift from architect to artist. Loved it!
5,Hogan's Heroes,"Hogan's Heroes seasons 1-5 was great for the person I gave the DVD to. He was in the service during the time it was air on T.V. He enjoyed the humor that was put into the production of Hogan's Heroes. I myself have sat down, watch some and honestly can say I enjoy it. It is a clean program which today is a plus."
3,"We'll have a slaw burger, fries and a bottle of Ski.","This was the first album by the rock-country quintet from Edmonton, Kentucky. It also happened to feature their four biggest hits on the Country charts: ""Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine"" (#25 hit), ""Dumas Walker"" (#15 hit), ""Oh Lonesome Me"" (#8 hit) and ""Rock 'N' Roll Angel"" (#23 hit). There are some really good songs here, but there are also some rather bad songs here, too (with ""Rock 'N' Roll Angel"" being one of the bad ones, despite becoming a hit). It's an uneven album, but fans of country music that adds rock to the mix should find something to enjoy here."
4,Nice Cross-Stitching Book,"It's quite nice. Although if I had a chance to go through it prior to buying it I probably wouldn't buy it. It has really nice patterns, but not really my style."
4,"Beauty, Passion, Desire, Love, Sorcery, Violence, Death ...","Beautiful women, bold men, treachery, wars, rape, pillage, gruesome butchery ...the passions of the mankind are in these tales of ancient oriental tribes.The writing is amazingly vivid. I could almost imagine a samurai jumping out of the page and plunging his sword into an enemy heart. The furtive passionate embraces are treated with a delicacy unlike the modern day novels where sex is like brushing one's teeth.The apt analogy I can think of in the context of these stories are the celebrated movies by Kurosawa wherein the passions are not sterilized for the comfort of the watcher."
3,Also helps for GC version,"I first rented RS3 on GC but then bought it on PS2 and also picked up this guide. It provides so-so strategies, but on door assaults the writer needed to be reminded your squad is not invinsible! I think the writer played the game on veteran (normal) difficulty not hero (hard) so some of the tactics aren't right. It's weapons detail sucks at the beginning of the mission they just suggest the M16, you can't use that inside, just alcatraz. On Island Estate they tell you to use the silenced MP5, which is a great weapon but not fit for that situation. Your sole teamate uses the TMP which is a silenced machine pistol, a piece of crap. I suggest you use the M60E4 or M249, which are Light Machine Guns that mawl anyone at close range. All in all a horrible guide for a good game. As I said in my title it also helps for GC version who's campaign is the same in PS2"
4,quirky and fun,"the monie depicts these wonderfully flawed characters that are riddled with problems that they themselves are the biggest hindrance in moving forward with thier lives, you cant help but wince, laugh, and root for them all. Dummy is a warm movie worth watching more than once"
2,Works okay but only for light use...,"A decent product for what you pay I guess, but it looks sturdier than it is, especially considering it's a double ""X"" stand. Product bent after putting a DJ coffin on it, would have expected it to be a bit sturdier. Also, it's hard to get it to sit flat, and the adjustment bar requires a wrench to make any changes, there are other models that are a lot easier to use. If you're using a light weight keyboard and just need something cheap to get you by, this should work pretty well, but if you require a bit more performance take my advice and spend a little more money and get something that's going to last, work well and be easy to use."
1,poorly made unstable,"One of the screw treads came out of the box stripped and now the stand wobbles, i hope my key board does not fall."
2,not enough info given,This product is only approved for CASIO keyboards. and only like three of those. Wish I would have known before hand!
1,missing parts and terrible customer service,"Our box also arrived taped up, with no external protective packaging. One of the 8 screws was missing, and the special screwdriver was missing too. The Casio customer service number referred me to a Parts Replacement number. The Parts Replacement number referred me to a local parts distributor. The local parts distributor number has a constant busy signal (we've dialed it for days). The next closest parts distributor (1000 miles away) said they don't support Casio products anymore (but Casio had given me their phone number). The screws are an odd metric measurement that our local hardware store doesn't carry.This has been one big hassle. It looks like it might be a decent stand once we have the pieces to put it all together, but I recommend that you buy it in a STORE instead of on-line, and check that all the parts are there before you leave."
1,Worst stand ever!,"The first one of these stands came without screws! The second came without a leg! After that, Amazon told me they wouldn't send me another and they were discontinuing it because of problems with the boxes coming open in the mail and screws being missing. Yet months later it is still available here. If you did order it, look for the screws in the screw holes. That confused me at first, they put the screws in the holes so you have to unscrew them first instead of in a seperate bag. That doesn't mean they wont be missing half the time though. Don't buy this stand!!"
1,A Big Piece of Junk!,"This stand is worthless! Not only did you have to put it together, but they did not even include the right parts! After a half-an-hour I finally realized that it was impossible to put this together because two of the main parts were missing!I finally wound up throwing the whole thing in the trash! Don't waste your time and effort!Dr. Rik PfenningerPSU"
4,Good series,"Another good installment on the SG1 spinoff. The characters are good, and the writing is done well. A good addition to your home collection."
5,Love the show,"Great show... Amazon streaming can be sporadic, but then, nowhere else to stream the Stargate series through. Seriously... There's more words required. Fahgetaboutit... not going to bother reviewing anything else when there is a freak in minimum!!!"
3,Stargate Atlantis Season 4,It's a nice distraction but after so many seasons its becoming kind of the same.
5,Lifeline,THE BEST YET... WE WILL MISS Dr. Elizabeth Weir SHE WAS THE BEST OF THE SHOW... I THING THAT SciFi Channel SHOULD HAVE PAYED HER MORE MONEY TO STAY ON THE SHOW... SHE WAS GREAT FOR THIS SHOW AN WILL BE MISS!!!!
5,stargate atlantis,one of my favorite shows. it miss it very much and look forward to a movie (that's what they promised)
4,Problems Fixed,"UPDATED REVIEW: The author has addressed the pressing issues in the supplied CD-Rom and has put up an errata site. I cannot stress enough the importance of the demos as they are proof of concept and gives the reader confidence in the material in the book. Some form of quality control really should have been done on the CD-Rom before the book shipped. At any rate, I am changing my review and giving this work a full recommendation as it is probably the most complete guide that an amateur and/or hobbyist programmer can perhaps hope to get on the matter."
4,Great small pump!,"I'm not a biking expert, just entered the sport to start triathlons. The pump is well worth the price, I was easily able to get 110 psi on my wheels. I'm not an idiot, but the directions were lacking, so it took a little while to figure out that the lever used to secure the head onto the stem was the opposite of every other pump I've used in the past. You place the head on the stem with the lever perpendicular to the stem, then extend it out so it's in-line with the stem to secure it.Up side: price, nice gauge, easy frame mount options.Down side: Small foot, needs better directions!"
3,Maybe they were trying too hard?,"It has become pretty well known that Roland Orzabal, the guiding light behing TFF has had a tendency to be a little too much of a perfectionist. Let me start off by saying that the title cut is probably the most fantastic sonic adventure I have ever experienced (although its sound is very Beatlesque Sgt. Pepper period it is original on its own and a true masterpiece). The rest just kind of leaves me flat and it is not because of lack of effort or melody. It just seems kind of overblown. ""Badlands"" tries to incorporate jazz influences but just comes off as long and tedious. Other cuts are tuneful and melodic enough but just don't move me. I think a lot might have to do with how brilliant the title cut is and I am being honest. I expected to just be blown away with the rest of it but was dissappointed because everything pales in comparision."
4,Great album!,"What a departure from their first two albums! I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this record up, and some songs I'm still not sure I like, but you cannot overlook ""Standing on the Corner of the Third World"" and ""Famous Last Words."" These two songs are easily some of my new favorite TFF songs, and I would highly reccommend this album to any TFF fans"
4,Bye Bye 80's,"If you believe that decades delineate musical styles, this is a perfect 80's-closer. Right here you have sunny pop (""Seeds of Love""), faux-Soul (""Bad Man's Song""), conscience (""Woman in Chains"") and the required angst-ridden tune about getting vaporized by The Bomb. This album is TFF's best, and some cool touches like the Dave Brubeck-style piano solo in Badman's Song freshen it. Orzibal is not the best lyricst (""Mind over matter won't stop all your chatter"" - e-yewww!) but his mistakes are few and forgivable. The star of the show here is Dave Bascombe, who produces the whole album to excess ... how 80's can you get?"
2,Lasted only two years.,"I have one of these units, manufactured in July 2007, and it broke today (October 2010). When listening to the radio, it goes completely silent every two or three minutes, then the audio comes back after 20 seconds or so. When it goes silent, the digital tuner screen also goes blank. This makes it virtually worthless.Even before today, I was never really totally happy with it. The radio reception is below average, and it can be hard to read the digital tuner screen if you're not at the right angle. It also takes up more shelfspace than I prefer.I'm going to junk it and replace it with something better. I hope to get a used SONY CFD-E100 Home Audio Portable CD Radio Cassette Player. They don't make those any more, but they are easily the best boomboxes ever made by any company, hands down. Here's a link to the CFD-E100:Sony CFD-E100 Portable CD Radio Cassette Recorder"
1,very dissatisified,"I ordered and received the Emerson PD9814 Portable CD Player April 2nd.It is unsatisfactory for my use...volume isn't strong enough, can't easily play songs in a different order and today it would start to play, and after 4 0r 5 seconds it would ""stick"" and not play any further. I want to return this player and find one that better meets my needs.Sue Skutley"
3,Great,"The time to get out was very quick, my husband is going to love his gift. They were hard to find but so happy I got them here. I am giving it a the just because the price was pretty steep but all in all very happy."
5,A True Classic!,"This is a MUST have for any L.A. Guns album or any 80s rock fan in general really. This is the first L.A. Guns album where singer Phil Lewis really got to show off his songwriting abilities in addition to some amazing vocals. Tracii Guns' loud and sleazy guitar riffs stand out as well. This album features radio and MTV hits such as ""Rip And Tear,"" ""Never Enough,"" ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" and the ever-popular ""The Ballad of Jayne."" There are also lesser-known but just as impressive gems such as ""Malaria,"" ""Magdalaine"" and ""17 Crash."" This album really does have something for everyone. Do yourself a favor and buy this album now. You won't be sorry! ;)"
3,"nice looking surge protector, but Monster could have done better...","for that price. appearance is nice. trying to connect the coaxial screw in plugs is an absolute nightmare, you'll need child size hands in order to attempt to screw them in. The cool looking blue light is also nice but can get annoying if not out of your sight."
3,One Issue,"This product was easy to use and did everything it said....almost. All of the power functions worked correctly however the ""cable filter"" actually filtered out most of our ComCast HD channels! We hooked the cable directly to our Tivo and the HD channels came back with no quality change from not using the filter. The filter apparently worked too well!"
3,Nice product..Blue light??,Nice product..Important to have clean power for Electronics...satisfied with quality...but that blue light on the strip is too bright....well at least it can double as a night light.
4,Good product for the price,Exatly what I was looking for. Good quality product with all the protections and number of outlets I was looking for. Looks cool and very functional with two adapter sockets on he ends of the power strip.
5,recomendado!,"Ciertamente es bastante economico, lo que no le quita en absoluto su caracter de un producto de primera linea,en caracas ciudad donde habito, son muy comunes las variaciones de corriente electrica,. pensando en mi home theater y en lo costoso de esa inversion,decidi comprar este producto y de verdad no me quejo en lo absoluto,hace el trabajo de manera maravillosa,,tiene una apariencia hermosa,viene con unas etiquetas para los cables que son magnificas para no tener un desastre de cables (igual el desastre continua pero no taaanto)lo unico que me parece incomodo es la parte del cable rg ya que es un poco angosta,pero igual eso se conecta una sola vez .recomendado ampliamente"
3,"seems good, a bit cramped","My only issue with this product is the lack of space between outlets. If you do not have any oversized plugs it isn't a problem, but we have some older home theater equipment that does."
5,My favorite guitarist,"Ye old English Invasion guys. You know--- Clapton, The Who, The Stones, McCartney, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Deep Purple, etc. These guys have done so much for modern music it's not even funny. Then there's David Gilmour. My favorite guitar player. He certainly did make a mellow record here. I don't have a problem with that. I wasn't needing another MLOR or Pulse CD. After listening to this a few times, I think THIS is EXACTLY what I needed to hear from him. McCartney and Gilmour's new albums are very mellow and rich with classic sound. I've been a fan of Floyd since I was really young, so I'm not 'shocked' by this album as some people might be expecting the 'Keep Talking', 'Young Lust', or 'Run Like Hell' sort of Floyd sound that is so massively popular. I like the Gilmour stuff from 'Obscured by Clouds', 'Atom Heart Mother' and 'Meddle', so this just sounds like a new millennium Gilmour playing this side of his music to me."
3,Very Floyd Sounding,"This CD has the feel and sound from the Animals CD. It's very relaxing but I think I was expecting more solo stuff from David. Oh well it's still great to hear something new, even if it's not new Floyd."
2,"Even for laid back, mellow music , it's average","If you've already got the title track song, you've got the best thing about this CD, imo. I put this CD on at work, and it went by completely unnoticed...If Gilmore was interested in making a poignant, from-the-heart CD that captured his feelings, disposition, metabolic mojo , etc,etc...he probably succeeded brilliantly here. Unfortunately for me, that equaled 1 long, uneventful, musical listening nap..."
5,Let's hear it for consistency.,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It's a regular disapointment to me that most artists don't seem to know what exactly is special about themselves. Clapton gets lost in the ideas of whatever producer he's working with, and (Jeff) Beck chases the latest trend to the horror of his original fans. Gilmour's sound and style has been perfected, and is not in need of change."
4,"Gilmour the musician, Waters the poet","I have been a Gilmour fan since 1970 when I bought Ummagumma. On an Island is a good solo effort, but I can't say it's his best. I love the guitar solo on the blue. Gilmour has always been a lead break innovator and here he has taken it to a new level. Just beautifukl and haunting. In response to the Waters fans, (slipin sliding, etc), the best PF songs were mostly chord progressions created by Gilmour! Comfortably numb, Run like hell, Time, Us and them (Wright)... Waters would be nowhere without his bandmates (and his solo efforts bear that out. Waters is a great poet, NOT a great musician."
4,yes this is good...very mellow,"I really like this new cd from DG. It's not PF but neither were the last two PF albums. I haven't really been into PF since Roger Waters left. I liked some of Momentary and could really care less about the Division Bell cd. I didn't even go see them in concert for either of those albums.In my opinion PF should have renamed after Syd left. Totally different stuff you know?So lets take this new record by DG under review...I wasn't expecting very much at all from this. In fact I wasn't even sure why I bought it. Probably because 99% of the music out there today is pure crap. So I took a chance...I'm glad I did.I love the instrumental tracks and really love Take a Breathe.Blah, Blah, Blah...I liked it and I'm very hard to please."
2,Boring from Gilmour,This is bad from Gilmour. But this is more Pink floyd than the last Pink albums(1986-1994).This is a bad blue copy of Waters and Pink Floyd.booooooooooooooooring album.
1,David on Prozac,I found this album to be a waste of time and money... not what I expected from a guitar god. Not much energy and muddled lyrics. Not at all Pink Floyd type effort. As a Floyd fan and having been to several Floyd concerts as well as seeing David's solo concert I am saddend to see David produce such drivel. 1 star for nice packaging.
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WHAT CAN A PERSON SAY BUT "" GILMOUR SHINES ON"" BUY THIS CD ITS ONE OF THE GREATEST WORKS BY THE FLOYDMAN......."
4,Pink Floyd Light,"For all you Floyd/Gilmour fans if you're expecting some heavy,aggressive Floydian style music forget it. If you're expecting anything like his last one was ""About Face"" from 1984, nothing like it. It is definitely on the mellow side which isn't entirely bad but for my personal taste prevented it from being a 5 star review. I would have liked a few more rockers myself. IT really reminds me alot of the film soundtrack ""More"" by Floyd from 69'if any of you old timers are familiar with that one. Moody,light & smooth. Definitely night time music. He has his bandmate Rick Wright on keyboards for a couple of songs, Crosby&Nash on the title track & Phil (Roxy Music) Manzenera ironically enough on keyboards too instead of his normal excellent guitar playing. Still Gilmour managed to come out with an entertaining & enjoyable disc. As long as you don't mind ""Mellow"" you will still be pleased with the results. Think of it as listening to Pink Floyd ""LIGHT"" - Larry Anger"
1,A Real Bummer,Being a DG fan and A pink Floyd fan since the beginning I personally find this album a letdown. I am travling from Alaska to see two shows in the LA area and I'm sure they will be great but I won't be dissapointed if he leaves out most of this CD. Take A Breath and The Blue are my favorites but the rest of the album sounds like Dave wrote it while sitting in a rocking chair. I've waited almost 20 years for this!!! Sorry Dave. I hope you do another soon and that you get a second wind. Short and Sweet!!!!! Ray Lapinski
2,Yawn...,"Been there, done that, done it better...That should be the title for this album. At best, this can be described as background music. Just chill out and make mellow love with your woman to this.Typical Gilmour with his unique guitar sound on this. I love the way the man plays and sings. Unfortunately, there's nothing AT ALL memorable about this album.The funniest thing about this album is that the guitar on the track ""Smile"" sounds like something off of Roger Waters' ""The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.""I am wondering what Gilmour was trying to do in putting out this album. Everything here is rehashed from Pink Floyd albums and there's nothing vaguely original about the album at all. Many of the tracks sound like instrumentals off ""The Division Bell"" and ""Momentary Lapse of Reason.""Unless you're the ultimate Pink Floyd ""collector,"" you can safely skip this."
2,David's worst album,"I had very high hopes for this cd when it came out. Not just because I am a huge Pink Floyd fan but I loved David's other two solo albums. This album is a huge disapointment. The songs are boring, bland and lifeless. There is nothing very memorable on here. I heard it maybe two or three times and I just can't get into it. If you want to check out his good work then buy David Gilmour or About Face. Those two albums are great. This one is just forgetable. Looks like he really does need to reunite with Pink Floyd"
4,Very disapointed about the RAH track,"I just received this mini dvd, all is great except the RAH track ""TAKE A BREATH "" . I dt talk about the song itself, it's a great track, but the way it is edited, ... The editing is too much fast.. Changement of cameras each seconds, too many lights and flashes etc... i watched the track and i had a headache very fastly ,before the end of the song... To compare, for exemple, Pulse : the guitar is clear, the musicians etc... of course there are effects too, but all is very clear. Here there are too many disturbing effects, too much smoke on the scene, the light is too white very often, impossible too watch the TV too long time... The last minute of the track look like a MTV crazy clip, impossible to recognize nothing .I am very desapointed and i am afraid about the new dvd that must come in february... if all is filmed and edited like this, it will be a mess...."
1,Serious disappointment,"I'm a big fan of his previous solo work - in addition to Pink Floyd. But this CD is really a letdown! There are a few very brief moments of greatness, but mostly just crap."
4,Blissful mellow gold,"Let's face it...there's never going to be another Dark Side Of The Moon or The Wall and this new release from Pink Floyd singer guitar player David Gimour which takes a sweet laidback approach was initially diappointing to me.I miss the clever lyrics of Roger Waters,hell I miss the glory days of Pink Floyd before hip hop took over the world!However on subsequent listens this album really grew on me.With great mellow guitarwork ,Gilmour's smooth vocals it casts a tranquil spell.It'll never become a classic like most Pink Floyd releases but if you give it a chance it's a pleasantly satisfying often beautiful album."
2,Not His Best,"Not David Gilmour's best work but it's OK. The first cut is an instumental and acts as an intro to cut #2 ""On An Island"" which is a decent song both lyrically and musically. He get's help on this from Crosby and Nash (no Stills). 3, 4 & 5 are sleepers as in they will put you to sleep. 6 ""This Heaven"" is a really nice ""Bluesy"" cut and I think it is my favorite. 7 is an instrumental but it is very forgettable. 8 is cheesy, just not at all what I would expect from David Gilmour and you will never ever hear this on any radio station. I listened to 9 ONCE and now I skip it. If I make a copy of this for the car I will leave it out. The last song ""Where We Start"" is ok but again it is very laid back but it does have a nice guitar solo. There is some excellent guitar work sprinkled about the whole album. This is an album that many PF and DG fans looked forward to for some time now and I suspect that many of them will be disappointed. (Where is Roger?)"
2,Wake me when it's over,"I read in a UK music magazine that David Gilmour sold his rock-aristocracy-country-pile in favor of a houseboat on the Thames, which is equipped with a priceless collection of high-end analog recording equipment and miles of audiophile oxygen-free copper wire. Perhaps that accounts for the somnolent but technically adept quality of this recording.Basically this is a collection of undeveloped ideas that probably would not have been released had it not been for Gilmour's name and reputation. The tempos are lethargic. The chord changes, when they finally come (""C'mon, give us an 'A' now, Dave, you can do it!"") are predictable. And while I'm sure Gilmour's nth and current wife is a charming companion she is not a lyricist of any obvious talent.If you're looking for some of the magic of Pink Floyd, you'll not find it here. On the other hand, if you're having trouble getting to sleep there are worse things to have on your iPod ..."
2,eh...,"These guys had a couple good ideas, but their arrogance ruined the movie for me. They have a few modestly intellectual observations, but they are so proud of themselves for speaking up about them the movie is unpleasant to watch. Nothing deep or terribly cleaver here... Only mildly entertaining, you can see the best parts in the trailer/promo. My copy ended up at the landfill."
1,Too bad!,"I really wanted to like this mug! I am a breast cancer survivor and wanted to carry a mug that supported the cause, but this mug is the worst!! Liquid just dribbles out making it difficult to drink out of, and the mug is extremely top heavy so it falls over...mind you that is the one time that the liquid doesn't just dribble out! I would not recommend this mug...as a matter of fact I am searching for a new one!"
3,Trouble with lid,"I received this mug for Christmas. I really love the mug itself. When I got the mug, it took me a long, long time to figure out the lid. It looks like it would screw in; that didn't work. Finally I set the mug on the counter and pressed it on. That sort of worked, but it wasn't all the way in. So I took it off and pressed it in with the drinking lip pointing towards the handle, then I turned the lid a quarter turn and this seems to work most of the time. There were no instructions with the mug, just cleaning directions. It would have really been nice to know how to get the lid on the cup and make it tight. Overall it is a great mug. The company should provide instructions."
4,helpful for psoriasis,"I have a small patch of psoriasis and used this in combination with zinc pyrithione. The combination really helps the flaking and seems to keep the itching at bay for most of the workday, so I apply it 2-3 times per day. When I use this salve, the psoriasis still looks a little red, but it has good emollient qualities so I don't have to worry about the ugly and noticeable flaking anymore. Now and then I even get a few days of ""remission"" before it comes back, which is a big improvement over the constant flaking and itching I had with other treatments. I'd recommend this for any kind of dry, flaking skin. I can't really attest to how it works on burns, rashes, etc."
3,"50/50, so-so","There is some really cool bands on here, then there is some really awful bands on here. If you like heavier Goth bands like me, you will like about half this. some of these bands are like glam-techno. Some of them reminded me of midnight oil (but maybe not even that good) Anyway, you'll have to be your own judge on this one, I think it is very mixed and matched, styles aren't the same. If the video was a little cheaper maybe that would add to my stars, maybe if more real heavy goth bands were on here, that would too. The DVD starts off good, then lightens up all the way to the end...."
5,THIS IS GREAT STUFF!!!,"I had bariatric surgery and this product was recommended, so I bought some and I LOVE it! It really works."
5,Wonderful book,"This book is well-written and captivating. Each chapter gives great details in leading up to the trial, as well as what happens after. I enjoy it immensely. I definately recommend it to history buffs and to trial watchers."
3,Bluebird house,House was as description said only trouble was the door swings up and not down when you open the door. This creates a problem when the eggs are in the house and when babies hatch out because when the door swings out and up the top of the goes door goes into the house and unless you watch closely could hit the eggs or babies. I changed the door so the opens down now the bottom of the door when it swings in only touches the bottom of the nest. This is a very good house birds used it the first year. I would buy it again
2,So much better Dead to choose from....,"The sound quality on this release is horrendous and the performances aren't much better. The drums come across like cardboard boxes while the bass sounds like a dull thud with the occasional annoying buzz.Some have argued that Winterland, where these performances were recorded in October 1974, had such horrible acoustics that a good-sounding live album was next to impossible to record there. The stunning and highly recommended Closing of Winterland CD puts that falsehood to rest. Needless to say, this set will MAYBE find its way into your CD player once or twice before it's permanantly and justifiably retired.For GOOD live Dead, try any of the 32 volumes of Dick's Picks along with Europe '72, Live Dead, the aforementioned Closing of Winterland, and Without a Net."
2,Pass on this and get GD Movie Soundtrack,"Anyone who tells you this is a good buy, has no clue what they are talking about. Sure the performances are strong, it was their farewell shows, but the sound quality is horrible. Easily the worst sounding Dead release. Phil Lesh, himself, said this CD set sounds awful. However, there is an alternative. A few years back when they issued the GD Movie on DVD, they released a 5 CD set from these same Farewell shows. Simply called the GD Movie soundtrack. The songs are pulled from the exact same shows but the sound quality is amazing. Well worth the buy. So pass on ""Steal Your Face"" and buy the GD Movie soundtrack. Same material plus much more and much better souund quality."
5,The Classic Chabela with the classic rancheras,"Chabela's strong, powerful, heartfelt interpretations of the classic rancheras are indeed,very moving . This is a ""must have"" recording for those who appreciate the beautiful voice of this extraordinary singer."
2,Thong Sandal,"I like the style of this sandal, but it was not really comfortable, so I returned it.I had a very similar ""Sonoma"" sandal from Kohl's that I loved. I couldn't find it in the stores anymore, but I did find it on their online site. I ordered it from there and also saved a lot of money!"
4,Very comfortable,These are THE most comfortable shoes with my plantar fascitis foot problem that I have recently aquired. I highly recommend them. I wish they were more durable for wearing at the beach et......
5,Heavenly,I have been wearing only Mephistopheles shoes for over 10 tYears. My feet used to hurt so much that I required medical treatment. These shoes have eliminated this pain. They are wonderful.
3,Naked at the Feast: A Biography of Josephine Baker,"This book was delivered in a swift and manner. The book was in good condition, but the cute cover was missing. I ordered other books on Josephine Baker and this one compared favorably."
5,Great scsi cd drive,"It old and hard to find, but it has scsi connection,built like a tankAnd it will last a life time ."
2,Does not impress the ladies,This was on sale when I bought it and it looked ugly. It was the bug fake pearls that I gave to a date of mine and she hated it. Buy the real stuff.
5,5 Stars,"I gave this item 5 stars. The reason why is it was in great condition, and I love Inuyasha. My husband even has Inuyasha and Kagome tattooed on his leg."
2,It's hard to tell where they went wrong on this one,"This album was released during my stay at Gordon College. It's a long story why I was there, so I'll skip it. I saw Determination in a mall in northern MA, near Gordon. I couldn't believe it! A band whom I had known when they were nobodies had made their way into a shopping mall. I can't say it is a sellout album either. It is just that it is a mediocre album that really adds nothing to the genre that has not been done before, and it seems that the song craftsmanship had fallen short of my expectations I had since listening to Reject the Sickness."
4,God Forbid Rules,God Forbid sounds like the music inside the head of a serial killer with Tourette's syndrome. Get this CD!!
5,A Beautiful Effort From An Amazing Band,"The first time I listened to this CD I said, ""Hmm."" Jump, Little Children are my favorite band, and I knew I wouldn't be disappointed, but I was intrigued at the difference in this CD and their previous efforts. ""Vertigo"" isn't as easily accessible as ""Magazine,"" which may lead many listeners to either quickly dismiss it as unlistenable or proclaim it genius without much thought, not unlike Radiohead's ""Kid A."" But I think it takes several listens to ""get"" this album, and that's a good thing. The songs are each densely layered, with a more emotionally and sonically mature sound, in my opinion, than their previous work. I think it's an album that will take a number of listens to appreciate, but I don't plan on quitting listening to it any time soon, or maybe ever."
5,great cd,jump little children put out an awsome album following Magazine. Vertigo is an orchestral masterpiece. An album you'll never get werry of.
5,JLC : Continuing to be GREAT,"I have been waiting for this CD for awhile. It is the best Jump album yet. Vertigo is now my new favorite song by Jump Little Children. Though the subject matter is heavier than Magazine, the beat is light and many tunes are very memorable. A must have for all Jump Little Children fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Absolutely absorbing and elegantly written biography of a great man!,"Incredibly interesting and really a good, hard look at the life of John Milton and what inspired him and what aroused his wrath. His poems are eternal and deal with things secular and spiritual. His words have come down to us through many centuries and they are still as powerful as the day he wrote them. What a true genius! What a stunningly beautiful biography...I couldn't put it down."
5,Outstanding spiritual reading,I have never been disappointed with a Joyce Rupp publication. She has the humility and insight to reach all levels on their journey. This book is another one of her great works.
1,So disappointed.,I took down my 2011 Tolkien calendar after three months. The pictures were just ugly. I was so looking forward to having a new Tolkien Calendar this year and now this? Why is this artist repeated? The subject matter is so rich surely there are artists clamoring to provide better work.
2,Unfortunately completely outdated,"I wanted my children to see images and learn about Israel before our trip. Unfortunately, the book is outdated and inaccurate. Because it was published in 1962, it does not depict Israel's current borders, current population and current cities. ALthough it is a beautiful book, the pictures do not reflect Israel today."
5,Save You rLower Back.,I like this DVD because it is slow and relaxing. The ocean waves make it easy to relax and the instructor's voice is easy to listen to. The exercises are just what I needed for my back pain. I am 65. It saved me a lot of money since the co pay on phyisical therapy was more than I could pay.Thank you.
4,An eloquent and realistic documentary on the topic of death.,"This book was recommended to me after I lost my mother to cancer. The writer, also an adult who lost her mother to cancer, very eloquently describes her conflicts in feelings as her mother's life slips away. These feelings are no doubt those experienced by many adult daughters. This is a must-read for anyone wishing to more fully understand the special feelings between a dying mother and her adult daughters."
4,Batik Fabled Cloth of Java,"This book provides so much of the information I was seeking.Geographical,historical,pictorial,technical,ancient and contemporary.The cloth itself comes with a rich history and part of the pleasure of collecting batik is identifying the motifs and colour usage from various areas.This book can and does provide so much background content of interest that it is difficult to peruse methodically and the urge to flick backwards and forwards with each page promising curious temptationsto absorb."
2,Excellent cast wasted in terrible script,"I agree with the one star reviewer who asked what these fine actors--Kenneth Branagh, William Hurt and Blythe Danner-- are doing in this terrible film. It promises a lot but it adds up to a heap of prententious nonsense. I'd watch William Hurt in almost anything but even his presence doesn't save this mess."
3,It could have been so much more...,"This movie could have been so much more! The plot and concept were good but it was like getting a ground rule double instead of a home run. The acting was good, although Madeline Stowe's talents were not used to their fullest and we did not see nearly enough of Hurt."
5,THIS cd is the BEST for TRANCE,"If you love trance music, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you buy this cd. it is AWESOME...I listen to it all the time. A while back, I lost the second disk and was trying SO HARD to find it, until today when I found it on this website. Believe me, I don't obsess about music, but THIS compilation is AWESOME!!!BUY IT!"
2,Good content poor binding,"FYI: Book content is good, however the crafting/binding is poor. Without much use several pages are falling off."
3,Oh.......Men Can Be So Dense,"Like other reviewers, I thought that this was not one of Ms. James best books. The hero and the heroine fought constantly and then make up. Only to fight again some 5 pages later. I thought that the chemistry between them was great and so was the passion. But what was the real story here? Was it the love that overcame mistrust? Was it who was trying to dirty Thorne's name? Was it the fight between the English and the Welsh? I was never quite sure. The book basicly boiled down to the heroine backing down up until the end and then the dense hero coming to his senses and realizing that not only does he love her, but she does indeed love him back."
5,tactical turtleneck,As far as I know this tactical turtleneck was good. I sent it to a buddy as a joke.. I told him he cannot get into any gunfights or infiltrate high security areas with out it. This was the slightly darker black version.
1,I would give it -0 stars if I could!!!,"I have been using this product along with the serum and skin brightner for over 3 months and it has done absolutlely NOTHING for me, absolutely NOTHING!!"
2,This Product Is Not For Everyone! Please Be Careful!!,"I used this product not knowing how my skin would react to the Hydroquinone, and it made my skin EXTREMELY IRRITATAED. When using this product I developed small red irritated bumps on my skin and it looked like a bad rash.I stopped using it right away and it healed with some Aloe Vera, then about a year later I decided to give it another go, and I had the same reaction from when I first used it. Everybody's skin is different and please be aware that Hyrodquinone is a potentially dangerous chemical, if you have sensitive skin then this is not for you. AND DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR FACE! Test it out first by using it on a small area on your skin."
2,Pamer's Skin Success Fade Cream,"I have been using this product on my hands for 4 weeks now and there is no change whatsoever in the appearance of age spots. If anything, It might have made them appear more red. I am very fair. There is no lightening effect at all. I give it two stars because it does provide moisture to the skin and it does contain Alpha hydrox which should at least exfoliate dead skin cells. Although I have not seen any brightening of the skin on my hands either. I will not purchase again and feel that Hydroquinone 2% is not sufficient enough dosage to lighten any areas of hyperpigmentation. You would probably fare better by just applying a good antiaging face cream to your hands for improved skin texture and lightening of age spots. I use the same product I use on my face and hands now for overall antiaging effects."
5,Moving and Engaging - Definately Worth Reading,I thought that the book was very well written and engaging. Ms. Mints writes very well and draws you in from the beginning. It is one of the better books that I have read as it is real and powerful...showing the side of mental illness that so many of us fear and rarely talk about.
4,fine tale,"Fraser Irving's art in this GN is wonderful and inventive, the black and white style and the period pieces along with a very Forte tale make this well worth the cover price alone."
4,a rude awakening movie to americans,"this movie will tell you how stupid the american government is and not just this administration. i felt so ashamed by watching this movie. and now i know why other people and us calling ourselves 'the ugly american', no, 'the heartless, stupid, absurd, cruel americans'. fighting terrorists has changed america to become a nation run by terrorists. my god, what a shame......"
3,Dolph Lundgren as usual,The story was weak. Dolph Lundgreen had a little more dialogue than normal. He is a little less sexy as his features seemed more gaunt. I give it a three star for the good kicks which I expected and got but I could have missed seeing this one with no regrets. Thank God I only rented this.
3,OK,"This is an OK dry shampoo. I have tried the TIGI Rockaholic dry shampoo, as well as the Batiste Original and Batiste Blush.- Both Batiste Original and Blush leave my hair smelling like I have a strong product in, but it does not give me the clean feeling I get from the Rockaholic. With the Rockaholic I feel like I really washed my hair, but with the Batiste it makes me want to go back home and was it fast. Not a clean feeling.- Rockaholic really gets rid of all the oils on my scalp, literally breaking them down. Because of this I also get a lot of volume on my roots. This did not happen with Batiste.Overall, Batiste is an OK product but I wouldn't repurchase. (On the other hand, Rockaholic only lasted me for a month because the dispenser tends to get clogged or waste (?) some product). I've only had the Batiste spray for 2 weeks so I can't evaluate it on the quality of the dispenser/packaging yet.Hope this is helpful."
2,smelly,"I really dislike the smell. I also don't like how the spray comes out with so much force. It just seems hard to control when there's such a concentrated blast, and I can imagine it won't last long that way. Then when I brush it out, my brush ends up with all this residue on it. Effectiveness-wise, it seems ok. It soaked up some of the grease in my hair but I have to say I expected more from it."
4,Works well when you're too busy to wash your hair,I love dry shampoo for those days when I didn't have time to wash my hair and just want to freshen up a bit.
2,Only got one use,"I read the warnings but didn't listen. I used it as soon as it arrived and it worked pretty well, the smell was overwhelming but it settled down after awhile. I was happy until a few days later I went to use it again and it had leaked all over the inside of the cap and the can was completely empty. Anything containing potatoe starch is probably going to clog. I don't know why they dont use a spray pump!?It's not worth the time and effort to send it back so I got ripped off the the tune of about nine bucks!"
4,Good When Despirately Needed,"Read previous reviews on this product, was a little iffy, but needed it. Product could be a bit cheaper for what it's worth. Product sprays out of can fine, after multiple uses, just wasn't expecting it to turn my hair white before I brushed it through, that was a bit shocking to see."
3,Not very helpful,"Good smell. My hair is not very oily, but I have very long hair, such that I want to use this between washes. But it is not very helpful, it can only make your hair look a little little bit better."
4,First dry shampoo to try,"I was skeptical in trying a dry shampoo. I've researched them and trying to find one was becoming a bittersweet task. I saw Batiste dry shampoo seeing it was economical in price and had great reviews, so it was a win-win for me. I have fine oily hair that I'm required to wash everyday just to get that clean feeling and avoiding an oily scalp. I used the Batiste and not only did it soak up the oiliness, but there was a lot of volume as well! Not to mention the tropical scent is not too bad either. I will be sticking to this dry shampoo for a good while."
2,Leaves residue,"I wouldn't buy this again. I mean, it does absorb some oil, but it leaves white residue in my dark brown hair even if I brush and blow it out. Also, it makes your hair really dull/matte...like, not in a good way. So then I have to use some shine spray. When it's all said and done, the time it takes to spray this stuff in, brush, blow, and refix...I could have just washed my hair again. I have thin, fine hair. Maybe it would work on different hair. Good luck dirty hair dudettes!!"
4,Nice Photos on Selected Peoples,"This book is basically a photo-oriented account of the author's trips to the Dani, Yali, Asmat and Momina peoples.The photos are quite nice, but the information is quite limited and dated."
3,Concise anti-genetic engineering argument,"In arguing against social darwinism and gentic human tampering, he does a great job of decontructing darwinism itself. Some simple, but classic arguments against darwinian evolution (he examines the Miller experiment involving creation of amino acids in ""primordial soup""), and some very good arguments against generic engineering."
4,fun movie,The movie is really not very good but it is kind of fun and it has the Hoff in it so it was worth it.
3,nick fury : agent of s.h.e.i.ld.,You people that are selling this dvd for $20 or more are crazy & or greedy! what the hell makes you think this is worth any more than $10!! get a clue!! it's over 10 years old.
3,It was ok,Box was not packed well. All of the parts were scattered and some pieces were missing. Not impressed. The shelf itself wasn't bad just disappointing to have to go out and buy parts for a new item
1,Used product sold as new,"When I received the Apex Rack, it had obviously been used. Everything was out of the packaging, and was rewrapped lazily and quickly. All of the bolts and washers were loose in the box, and some were suprisingly missing. The rack was scratched and dented, probably since it was used previously. I bought this as a new item, but it wasn't even close. Very disappointing."
3,incomplete,"I have actually ordered this same rack before, Very impressed with quality and found set-up took about 1/2hr: pretty simple. UNFORTUNATELY this second rack arrived in a box that looked tampered with and indeed was. Missing many of the screws on the plastic card. looks as though this left the warehouse this way. Did call company and am waiting on new screws. Will update when and if they arrive."
5,great rack,"It does everything you would expect it to do. The size is perfect for a home workout area, and you can not beat the price."
4,Had a good plot with much detail,"I thought the book was very well written. But after reading it several times I still had some trouble understanding it. If anyone could e-mail me, helping me to understand parts of it better, that would be wonderful!!! Please write back soon!"
2,Legend Or A Greatest Hits?,"Some reviewers show this as a great album. Try ""This Is The Moody Blues"" if you want a ""Great Album"". This is imcomplete but gets two stars for the Orchestrated versions of two tracks. Also artwork on ""Legend Of The Band"" has this CD included, weird stuff.Search ""Judemac forever"" on msn,yahoo or google."
3,a good shot,"well, eyes of war is her first book I guess, but while janna nickerson gave a worthwhile effort, parts of it were confusing. the way she jumped around the different points of view from the warriors to the elves to raxsen and then back to janevra, (that's not counting the thief girl and the phoenixes and caya and lousai and whatever else i forgot) it was kinda hard to follow. it was very long for the first book in the series and the print was really small, kind of tiring when its that way. i think some parts could have been used in the second book and the beginning part (the way she wrote it) is kind of mechanical. but like i said, its the first book, so lets see how the next one comes out."
1,One awful cliche after another.,"A princess with a name suspiciously similar to that of the author gathers an army to save the world from evil and raining fire? ""The Dragons"" must unite with ""the Forgotten"" to fight ""the Darkness""? Give me a break. This banal claptrap is what's giving modern fantasy such a bad name."
5,Extremely Good Book!,"I haven't finished the book yet, but I can tell it is amazing! it has enough cool monsters so it is like the Wheel of Time, but their is some Harry Potter like elements in it. Awesome!!!!!!!!!"
4,eyes of war by janna nickerson,"This is a book that can be read by all ages. It has beautiful descriptions of cities and goring word pictures of war. Once you start reading the book it is hard to put down. The plot is difficult to find at the beginning, but is seen very clearly at the end. The use of words is like seeing pictures. The book is a masterpiece of the use of words, and relates to the world at large today."
5,Simply Awesome,"This is one great fedora, especially for Indiana Jones fans (nerds) like me. The fur felt feels great and sheds water remarkably well. It also looks great, no matter if you are bumming, casual, or dressed up. Like all hats, this thing will only get better with age. The more ""Character"" it gets, the better it will be. I'm sure the cheaper wool felt ones are okay, but the fur felt Indy is the only way to go."
2,Hat Band not Dark Brown or Black,"It seems like a good sturdy hat but the color of the band that goes around the hat in the picture is Dark Brown-Blackish. The color of the band on the hat I got was a plain brown, it doesn't look like the same color as in the picture. I like the hat in the picture better, is the hat in the picture the same hat I got? or was it like the main model hat used to sell all the other hats? Looks like the front Brim of the hat in the picture is longer than the one I got too."
1,Don't Buy!,"Like the others said, I was expecting ""the world's best album"" and I got a bunch of old people talking..........not a single song! And I bought 2 and not sure how to return them???????????"
3,Unremarkable,"First off to give credit where credit is due. Sarah has a wonderful voice and her Cd's are always well produced. The problem here is that the songs don't really stay with you and after repeated listens to this CD I am left remembering very little of it's content. I have very high standards for Sarah as I fell in love with many of her releases to date. My suggestion would be to buy: Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, B-sides & Rarities and Surfacing before venturing into this unremarkable CD. Frankly, there is no afterglow happening here."
2,Unfortunately I have to Agree with Jeff Above,"I was really looking forward to this CD based on Surfacing and Fumbling, and bought it without hearing even one song off of it. Unfortunately this is a completely forgettable album. Every track sounds the same, there's no catchy arrangements, no variety, nothing to remember. He lyrics are right there, but the arrangements and production hides them behind banality.Sorry Sarah....KAC"
2,"blah, not up to par","Wow, what a disappointment. All the songs sound the same, and some even do a good job of impersonating Enya. Her last 2 cds were so fantastic, that if they were records they'd be worn out.Melodically speaking, the songs are really weak. Lyrics are about the same, songs about love, sensitivity, support, and lots of soulfullness, but the mixing and producing stink, it is hard to hear her voice under all the bland instrumentals.I've seen so many great artists drift into mediocrity, madonna, sting, phil collins, just to name a few. I won't be taking this one to the used cd store, but I can't recommend buying this one.Rex."
2,i'm afraid it's not very good,"from an objective point of view, this was not a good album by any standard. muscially it was poorly done, - voice hidden under layers of computer-generated music: bad - very bad. content wise it's very short, and lyrically not up to par. 'fallen is not enough to make it a good album. bottom-line: refrain from purchasing."
2,Been a long wait for not much content.,"10 songs in six years? Wow. You would think that there might be a little more to write about with all the turmoil of 9/11, birth and death--there's little hints of this becoming a better record than it is. Remember on FTE that little hidden track of ""Possession"" naked with only the piano and a little hand percussion-thingy? Well, this record will make you beg for those days. The vocals are almost completely hidden under layers of synth strings and outer space beepy sounds--and a host of other wasted effects that are a distraction designed to help convey a musical and lyrical depth that just aren't there. If you had 20 songs left in you, and you picked these as the ten best, there are maybe 2 that really belong. I should think you would throw all 20 tracks on there and let the fans decide. I hope there aren't any more tracks left from these sessions and she just chucks whatever may be left and starts anew with maybe some different producer/songwriters."
4,"Another gorgeous, haunting album...","This is one of my favorite albums of the year...it is what I listen to nearly every night when going to sleep. She sounds so gorgeous on every song. With the exception of some trite, cliched lyrics here and there, this album is near perfect. I love first single ""Fallen,"" ""Drifting,"" ""Train Wreck,"" ""Time,"" and ""Perfect Girl."" My two favorite songs are probably ""World on Fire"" and ""Answer"" though. ""Answer"" is one of the most beautiful love songs I have heard in a long time, and ""World on Fire"" just makes so much sense, and makes sense in such a beautiful way. This song has some awesome electronic elements to it (throbbing notes and stuff like that...should definitely be remixed for the dance floors!) Overall, I definitely like this one just as much as any of her previous work...she is one of my favorite (if not my favorite) female artists out there. Its been too long since she had put something new out...but it was worth the wait!"
3,Leftovers,"I have to agree with every one of you. My thought is this ... these are songs that were all written at the same time as those featured on Surfacing ... but they didn't fit, manager didn't want to make a double CD, whatever. Ergo, new album, ""...let's wait six years and hope no one notices. At the very least, all our die-hard fans will buy it and we'll have enough money for our next project."""
3,A Jewel in the rough album,"- ""Fumbling"" is still her best work- ""Surfacing"" is a runner up- ""Afterglow"" is very slow moving, perhaps often boring- Not her best work, not even comparable- ""Fallen"" is the chosen strong song- Vocaly, as always...(perfect)- Lyrical content: shallow, cliché, underachieved- Production is top notch- Performances were top notch- Worth purchasing if a fan of hers- Big disappointment for me personally.<OTHER RECOMMENDED ALBUMS SIMILAR-GENRA WORTH PURCHACING>* A Rush of Blood to the Head* Jagged Little Pill* Fallen From Grace* The Very Best of Sheryl Crow* Life for Rent"
2,Disappointing,"I always look forward to new music from Sarah - but the wait on this one wasn't worth it. It is mostly all ballads - not one of the songs, except Fallen, really sounds special - usually Sarah stretches things musically - but not here."
3,Sarah is still warming up,"After a few years aways from her music career, Sarah is a bit of rusty in songwriting and production. If you are trying to find substantially new sound or even the same level of music creativity, you would be disappointed. If you are a die-hard Sarah fan who wants the CD to complete your collection, like me, buy it. If not, just listen to the ones played on the radio."
1,Please do not fall for the hype,"I once considered myself a serious McLachlan fan, thoroughly enjoying such albums as Solance, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, and Rareties, B-sides, and Other stuff. However, I cannot express the disappointment of her latest effort, Afterglow. Clearly an afterglow is all that is left of her once unique and creative songwriting. I can not even force myself to listen to the album even once through completely. Sarah seems utterly dull on this album and lacks emotion as well as any creativity with her lyrics. Additionally, the string arrangements are shallow and do not compliment the music or McLachlan's beautiful voice. It's such a shame. Do yourself a favor and buy Leona Naess's latest self-titled CD instead."
3,i wanted this version,"i received this item but i can only recognized one of the songs from the dvd the brave one, that song is ANSWER, you then sent me another one, ive rung you several times but i have just put in another order for a prince cd, i just hope its what i want."
3,more of the same,"as a long time fan I have to say that this cd was not really worth the wait. music to do the ironing to. sadly on the strength of the tunes on this disc her fantastic voice will remain largely ignored here in the u.k.. stick with ""surfacing"""
3,"Good, but not great...","Fallen is a song up to par musically speaking, lyrically not as much growth as I would expect in a 6 years... Trainwreck has some good music, but the lyrics leave something to be desired. The rest of the songs aren't too memorable. I have to wonder where is the songwriting talent that gaves us:I Will Remember You, Angel, Building A Mystery, Do What you Have to Do, Adia, Possession, ElsewhereSarah just has lost her muse. Hopefully when she gets the critical(bad) feedback on this album from us her fans, she will understand she didn't do so well this time and it will drive her to really search deep for better lyrics. Also it would be better if her less ablum was less wall-of-sound-ish, you know what I mean."
3,"Beautiful vocals, boring album","Well, we have waited about 6 years for her follow up to the INCREDIBLE 'Surfacing'.It is worth the wait?For me personally, NO - I am disappointed.As usual her vocals are absolutely beautiful, and on the occasions were she uses her lower register - WOW! I would like to hear more sung in that key.But there is no 'Building a Mystery', 'Sweet Surrender', 'Adia' or 'Angel', or even 'Witness'. Nothing matches the power of those songs. 'Fallen', the lead track and single is beautiful, and probably the strongets track. Everyone will have their own favourite, but I don't believe anyone would consider it better.This album is much of a muchness, the same throughout."
4,A pleasing return... with time...,"After the first couple of listenings to Afterglow, I wondered what had happened to the Sarah of Fumbling. As I listened more though, I realized that she was still there, just layered more in her music. To those who have listened to this album and are unhappy, I provide the simple advice: give it time. While I encourge anyone and everyone to listen to Fumbling first, I think Afterglow is a fine addition to Sarah's body of work. Certainly ""Stupid"" and ""Time"" will join ""Good Enough"" and ""Sweet Surrender"" as some of my favorite songs.Whatever the case may be, it is nice to have a new album, and one that did not change her style completely (like some other recent artists)."
5,This is a totally AWESOME cd! Totally recommend it!,"I love this CD. For a long time I loved FALLEN but I never knew who it was by. Well, now i do. I've found that I completely LOVE Sarah McLachlan's CD. It is fabulous. I love lots of songs on it and it is a great cd when ur drivin in the car. Pleeaassseee, give it a try. It's worth it. I know u will love it. I did."
2,SAD DAY FOR MCLACHLAN FANS,WHAT CAN I SAY EXCEPT SAVE YOUR MONEY.... AS A MCLACHLAN FAN WAITING FOR THIS CD FOREVER AND THEN TO BE DISAPPOINTED HOW SAD.. SAVE YOUR MONEY FANS AND MAYBE SHE WILLCOME UP SOONER WITH SOMETHING TO MAKE US HAPPY
3,"beautiful, yes.","I enjoy this album, especially push. I am a sucker myself for extremely pretty love songs, and that is a really great one. The other songs are also very nice, i also enjoyed answer too. My favorite songs end up being the ones where there is love involved. But, overall, this album is better than surfacing, but not as magnificant as the others. Its definetley worth buying, and I was not dissapointed. Her voice is her voice and i will always be a fan of that."
2,Steady At [not Fumbling Towards] Mediocrity,"Too boring to ever really loathe, McLachlan has long remained on that cusp of mediocrity and frustration - hints of beauty surface here and there every few years, but the compendium is always the same - dull songs, listless vocals, uninspiring and lazy musical arrangement. Nothing here as breathtaking as `Ben's Song' or `Possession' or `Do What You Have To Do', but we have a host of replicates of the dreaded `Angel' and `Into The Fire' and `Solace' and any other countless fungible melodies from her pretty-enough canon. She might or might not be a hack, but if she is, she's a fancy hack. My grade: C+"
3,Just....Ok for me,"Huge Sarah fan that I am, this album has been my least favorite...the lyrics aren't so moving and the music is lacking something that FTE and Surfacing had captured so well. Hopefully in another 6-7 years Sarah's next album will have a more emotional pull for me. A couple of songs I did enjoy on the album were World on Fire and my favorite, Stupid (FTE like in sound, but way too short!!!!!)."
4,worth the wait,"Afterglow is an amazing cd. My only complaint is that there are only 10 songs. Sarah's voice is just as beautiful and soothing as ever. My favorites are ""fallen"", ""drifting"", and ""train wreck"". It is good to hear some new stuff from Sarah. This would also be a good intro cd for those who are not familiar with Sarah's other cds."
3,Afterglow - An albumn for those who are patient,"I am not a big fant of Sarah McLachlan, but I happened to catch her version of Full of Grace one day and I really loved her voice. It was very sweet, soft and calm. So I decided to give this albumn a try. At first I was disappointed because I couldn't find anything outstanding with her songs. Nothing in particular catches my attention throughout the entire albumn. I could let this CD run on the background for hours without even noticing it because it just doesn't sparkle. All songs sound similar, soft, slow and calm.Now however, I've listened for the CD for two days now and some songs start to grow on me. So if you are looking for an albumn of catchy sing-along songs, this one is definitely not for you. But you are one of those people who can chew on the songs for a long time, I recommend this CD.I still enjoy Sarah Mclahlan's voice. It is very pleasant to listen to. But I just wish the songs could've been more upbeat and catchy."
1,Disappointed,"I considered myself a Sarah McLachlan fan from the days of ""Solace."" I loved both that album and ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy."" With the release of ""Surfacing,"" I was disheartened, and with ""Afterglow"" I just can't be a Sarah fan any longer. I only found 2 songs to be good (""Perfect Girl"" and ""Fallen""), another 3 to be so-so, and the rest of the album to be tripe. It's a sleepy version of ""Surfacing"" with nothing new to offer. Even Sarah sounds bored singing her songs, and she looks sleepy in each of the three photos where she's shutting her eyes.Could there be any less emotion as she sings ""'Cause I'm a train wreck waiting to happen"" in ""Train Wreck""?Then: ""you save meyou complete meyou're the one true thing i know i can believe in"" in ""Push:""Say it isn't so Sarah...this has got to be the absolute worst song you have ever written. Trite!I'm just so disappointed with this album. The only thing I can think to use it for is to put me to sleep."
5,Your Sacred Self,This is a great book to help figure out what your Ego is doing and how to stop those behaviors that no longer serve you.
3,I wanted more,"If the point of the book was to give a Reader's Digest overview of Gatto's opinions, then it served its purpose. But, as someone who is going to be a teacher, I wanted more about how he dealt with the fact that he is teaching within such an unjust institution. How did he make sure his classroom didn't teach the seven lessons of compulsory school? Am I really doomed to teach this way because of the nature of my job? I wanted more solutions besides homeschooling. One-on-one is the best way to teach, but if both parent/guardians work outside the home, what are we going to do with the kids? Gatto left me hanging."
2,Frustrating and incomplete,"All in all this DVD is better and a whole lot cheaper then my last purchase: ""How to dance with two left feet"", but it is hard for me to say that I was at all satisfied even though the couple are beautiful dancers.First thing to note: there's some actual instruction, but only from the man (the girl never talks and becomes a bit of a distraction as you wonder if she ever will). Also, the steps are taught in one direction for both the men and women and then are briefly practiced in opposite directions and this was a real pain for us.Each dance opens with a total dance that shows all the moves, however, once each move is shown from several inconsistent directions, there is no review and you do not see how to put all the pieces together. We kept arguing with each other as to what direction we were to be going in because of how often it would change on the screen. Very frustrating!"
4,what's missing?,"Good news, bad news. This is a marvelous program, which I decided I had to buy after seeing the broadcast on PBS. While this is longer than the PBS TV show, ""Carol of the Bells,"" which was one of my favorites in the TV show, is not included here."
4,Christmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square Featuring Sissel,"This was a fine dvd with a good blend of traditional and less well known carols. The choir was excellent as always, although sometimes I found the new arrangements employed to be a bit disappointing, moving traditional carols to minor keys for example. In my view this measure did not always improve the overall performance of the choir, rather it showed how clever the arranger could be. Sissel was beautiful in every sense of the word. Her solos were inspirational and even when singing with the choir the clarity of her voice was outstanding. Well worth the money."
1,DVD stalling constantly,The DVD starts with great audio and super clear video. The a few minutes into the program it keeps staaling and skipping every few minutes only to completely freeze towards the end.
2,"Marginally useful, definitely religious","I have read my share of financial planning and management books and found this book to be lacking in ""advanced"" advice for couples who can pay their bills and avoid running up credit card debt. The first few chapters are nice because they do discuss the different types of personalities and their strengths and weaknesses. However, I couldn't help thinking that most of the book was just the same message repeated over and over: ""God wants you to both take responsibility for your finances, and that includes communicating about them regularly (and making a budget)."" I guess if you really can't get your spouse to agree on some basic ground rules (like if there are still checks in the checkbook, that doesn't mean you still have money), then this would be a good reality check. But I was disappointed in the limited ""couple"" advice and would suggest a straight financial planning-type book to read together and discuss."
1,Worthless Book,"This book is worthless. Its step-by-step instructions are filler and fluff. For instance, a three-step instruction on how to select a soundbite takes up a whole page.Step one: Place cursor over phrase (with picture)Step two: Hold down mouse button (with picture)Step three: Release mouse button (with picture)Ridiculous! It tells how to use plugins, but a good book should provide more theory. When teaching how to use a compressor, it should talk about threshold, attack, release and appropriate settings for vocals vs. drums. This book does nothing of the sort. A COMPLETE waste of money and the worst book I have ever purchased in my life. Shame on the author!"
5,Classics From an Underrated Genius,"When I think of my favorite performers, I rarely list Van Morrison. But I took this CD off the rack and played it and was instantly reminded of the incredible effect this music has on me. There's a package here-a combination of his voice, the melodies, and the lyrics-that reach directly into my heart. I can't think of many other performers who have this kind of emotional effect on me-I've often sat listening to this CD with tears streaming down my face. Morrison's voice is as distinctive as Sinatra's and conveys a great deal more emotion. So I'm making a resolution to listen to this beautiful, soulful music more often this year. Not many albums leave me feeling as cleansed as this. There are a few mediocre songs on this collection, but when he hits the target-Here Comes the Night, Cleanin' Windows, Domino, Wild Nights...no one can come near him."
2,Give me a Break.,"What happened to Staind? I was a fan of ""Tormented"" and ""Dysfunction"" but this CD is just a piece of pure garbage! From the contrived lyrics to the muddy and bland music Staind has proved that they were just waiting to get to the top of the music scene then conform to what MTV and all the other big corporations wanted to them be. And they did it, along with the guru at selling out, Fred Durst. This was a huge sellout record and it's just disgustingly pitiful. My friend burned me this CD and I'm glad because I got to hear it before I might've made the mistake of buying. I'm glad I didn't. So please, don't buy this huge disappointment."
4,Very Good,"I can't beleive some of these reviews on here, just comes toshow you that whats the point of writing a negative review?Staind is a very talented band, sure this is not quite as angryas dysfunction but that still doesent make this a BAD album.But whats so good is staind touched on different levels withthis Break the cycle. In alot of aspects it's just as hard asdysfunction, but also has alot of melledy that lacked a littleon dysfunction.also dysfucntion is good to. Someone quoted thatarron's liryics are what you would find in a 13 year old'sjournal, actuly that's not true. Break the cycle touches on somereally reality based issues like suiced,poverty etc. And arronlewis is one heck of a voaclist wether you agnoledge it or not.now as for the cd there are alot of notible songs on here likeopen up your eyes, presure,change. then you get into theacoustic ballad epiphany, that if in the mood will darn nearsend you to tears. I espeacialy like suffer, out side all greatsongs."
3,.............,"There is really like 4 really cool songs on this cd, otherwise its a dissapointment, i got tired of it really fast, not worth the 14 bucks, maybe worth like 9 bucks, Don't buy it unless your a hardcore Staind fan, which i was untill this cd."
5,Staind Delivers with long awaited album!,"For people like me who have been waiting for Staind to come out with a new album since Dysfunction, the wait is finally over! This album is great from start to finsih. The band does not sell out with hard songs like ""Cant Believe"" and shows a great new side with songs like ""Its Been Awhile"" and ""Epiphany"". ITs still the same old Staind setteling into a form of music thats very rare these days. Instead of just coming out and screaming everything Arron Lewis displays his great voice on all tracks. Of course the album wouldnt be complete with a recording of ""Outside"". Overall this album is a must buy for Staind fans both old and new. And for music listeners that want to hear something good."
4,Breaking away from the sterotype,"Staind has made a name for themselves, on Break the Cycle the new album goes through many ups and downs, songs like ""Pressure"" and ""Suffer"" still pack a punch, although they are not as heavy as songs on Dysfunction. Break the Cycle also has songs with deep meanings and melody such as ""Its Been a while"" and ""Fade"". Overall this CD is a great follow up to Dysfunction, staind can finall break away from being known as ""LB's foster children"", this is definitly worth checking out."
5,Staind Life Forever,"Staind is the best thing to hit the rock scene in a while. With Dysfunction they made a name for themselves as an emotional hard rocking angst band. With Break the Cycle they have stepped out from the wing of Fred Durst and just broken through. This CD has the best lyrics i have heard in a while, each has a very poetic feel and a unique message. IF you like It's Been A While buy this, you'll love it if you didn't, buy it anyway... it has great vocals and lyrcis with the same crunching guitar riffs... If made into a video ""Open Your Eyes"" will go down as an instant classic."
2,a sad but true review,"Look staind are an excellent band, with great riffs, and singing, though unfortunately staind has managed to fail like bands like limpbizkit, creed and more. You see staind use to be heavy and more agressive, and the lyrics where better to, though sadly fred durst made a record deal with them, and now they end up like this, with [bad] lyrics, and bad music. Oh well thanks for reading, go get dysfunction, their better album, which is what they use to be."
2,"Should be called ""Paind""","Initially, I liked the first single off this cd. Then MTV played it to death, as did my local radio station. Then came the next single (I don't even know what the songs are called), and it sounded like the same song.This guy takes himself too seriously and always looks ""Paind"". Get over it dude. You're a success now.Last time I heard them, I Staind my pants from boredom."
1,Forcefed Whining,"To be honest I didn't think the first Staind album was too bad but this album is basically just capitalizing on crybaby suburban angst. Aaron Lewis's lyrics are uninteresting and extremely repetitive. When you are thirty-something with a wife it is time to grow up. I'd be depressed too if all I did was smoke pot, play video games, and stare at my shoes on stage(he has no stage prescense)all day. The music does not just ride, but beat the dead horse that is Alice in Chains/Tool. It's all the same midtempo/melancholy/ballad stuff. To call this album rock is an insult to music in general. I'm just glad I never spent money on this piece of garbage"
2,Fred Durst Destroyed Them,"Staind was a really good band, emphasis on was. That was before Fred Durst and TRL, two forces you can count on to ruin anything. Dysfunction was a very good cd and I was hoping Break the Cycle would be too, but after I was informed that they performed on TRL a few days before this cd came out I knew it wasn't going to be. Unfortunately, Fred Durst's influence on them really shows. They sold out. Their decent musical ability saved them from dropping to the horrible level of Limp Bizkit, but this cd would have been a lot better if Fred Durst had just left them alone."
4,All Around Great CD,"Break the Cycle, while not the best CD of this year, is a great CD none the less. While not as good as their first CD, Break the Cycle doesn't let you down. One improvement from their first CD is that they now use more acoustic guitars. The stand-out tracks in my opinion are: #1 Open Your Eyes, #6 Can't Believe, and #7 Epophany. The hidden track (which is an acoustic version of ""It's Been Awhile"") is a great extra too."
3,Couldn't transfer to Ipod,Although the music is great it was not possible to burn all the songs to a format to transfer to my Ipod due to copy protection on the CD. Do not buy this CD if you need to transfer to an electronic format or listen to the music on a PC as it will not work correctly.
4,More of the Same,"This CD seems to be a continuation of the old one. Staind has made little improvement in themselves over the time between this new CD and the last. This is a bit lighter, and it comes off to me like many modified ""Home"" songs. If you enjoyed the last CD and want more, pick this one up."
2,Huh?,"Staind, along with the other ""alt-metal"" or whatever outfits, including Nickelback, Default, the Calling Puddle of Mudd etc, all have one thing in common. They are trying to resurrect a genre which already had its glory days..."
4,"Staind: Just the name, never the reputation","After hearing this CD for the first time, I knew it was a winner. Staind is one of the best new metal bands of the century and is very far from getting a bad reputation. First of all, these people have a respect for the art of metal music. Distorted, but lyrical; intense, but not too intense; overall, a musical experience. The band puts a strong point in their music, instead of just screaming. If you listen to the main singer's voice, you can tell that he's basing the songs on real-life experiences, not words on a script. It was a rather good mixing job as well, come to think of it. If you need something different than screaming and profanity, this is your lucky LP. Buy it today."
5,The Reason,"I was surprised with the depth and the musical accomplishments associated with this CD. Such songs as Fade, Epiphany, Waste, and For You are the blood of the album. Been Awhile, Outside, Open Your Eyes, and Outside are the bone of the tracks. The other songs are the album's flesh. Since all these parts are vital to live, this CD is unbelievably good. I truly and deeply recommend this CD to anyone. The CD may be slow, but in the end the vocals and lyrics are piercing, the guitar riffs and the drum beats all blend together. This is my favorite CD that I own, and deserves to be yours as well."
3,This could have been excellent...,"If Staind have been cast in the same realm as other popular hard rock groups of today such as Puddle of Mudd & Creed then they certainly have a more original sound than the others.Even the harder songs on this album (Open Your Eyes, Can't Believe) have a rich, dynamic melody while the more MTV friendly Fade & It's Been Awhile are instantly catchy without having the borrowed sound of Nickelback.The problem with this album has been echoed in almost every other review - the lyrics are awful!! Aaron Lewis may have a good voice but what he writes about is more often than not quite petty and juvenile. There is nothing wrong with a little sadness in songwriting - after all rock music started with the blues but this is just plain self pity. If Aaron can stop feeling sorry for himself because someone took his lunch money then perhaps Stainds next album will be the great work this one could have been."
2,Unimaginative,"In the past, I sort of liked Staind's earnestness, but after this long, it just seems tired. Three albums of increasing drivel is more than enough. Though I definitely like the major hit, ""Outside"", I can't find much else on this CD that feels in any way imaginative. It's especially upsetting to hear as many people as I do praising this album's lyrics. While I am glad to see people relating, i just think there's so much better, deeper lyrics out there. In all, that point is kind of my general complaint with all facets of this album. Good enough to gain acceptance, but anything except unique or truly visionary."
1,ben stien on vocals,"this band, and this album are boring.just becouse someone puts a lot of emotion into thier music doesnt mean that its any good.bands like staind, disturbed,nickleback, and system of a down are ruining rock and its stp's, audioslave's, qotsa's and the foo's job too shut them up."
3,It's ok..,"This is definitely better than Korn and Limp Bizkit, and all that, but really there's nothing all that special here. I like the songs ""Outside"", ""For You"", ""Open Your Eyes"", and ""Waste"", but the rest don't really do it for me. ""It's Been Awhile"" was good at first, but after like the 10,000th time, I got sick of it. ""Open Your Eyes"" has some more far-reaching lyrics than we're used to hearing from Staind, which is good, and the words to ""Waste"" are amazing. I couldn't believe what I was reading. Aaron Lewis has a good voice, but I just can't help but think he's trying to sound like Layne Staley. If you like this album, you should get ""Thirteen Ways to Bleed Onstage"", by Cold, and the classic ""Dirt"", by Alice in Chains. I'd say this is a definite improvement over the first album, but it's still a far cry from AIC."
2,"Bland, lame. oh and I feel your pain mr eyebrow.....","What in the world makes this band so great?? I know what makes them popular, our shallow mtv culture. This band has nothing new or inspiring to offer. What does that guy with the eyebrows ""lewis"" think he has the market on pain?? Is he the only guy who had a tough time growing up. Look we need real MUSIC this is garbage, it's all retread. Yea good friends with fred durst and korn, yep that explains quite a bit right there. When oh when is there going to be a flood of good music. This country is brainwashed by mtv, no wonder the rest of the world sees americans as fat and stupid, our heros are lewis and durst..."
4,"Repetitive, but well done...","Ah, yet again more alternative metal bands in the swing of things. However, this band rocks! Staind is musically talented and lyrically talented. However, I think they have the potential of being a type of prog-rock band. They have talent, but they are a little repetitive. Well, that's what your gonna get nowadays."
4,good cd,"this is a good cd, the best songs on here are probably epiphany and it`s been a while, i absolutly love it`s been a while, but theres nothing brilliant about this cd, its good but not brilliant."
3,Dysfunction is better,I like this CD it's just that I had such high expectations when I bought this. I'm so sick of Outside and It's Been Awhile even though they are great songs I just can't stand listening to them anymore. This CD is great if you don't expect it to be as good as Dysfunction but none of these songs really touch me as much as the ones on there first major release.
4,Hard to break in,The shoes are very nice looking but they are hard to break in. Once broken in they are comfortable but painful until then.
3,ok shoes,"these shoes lasted for 5 months then the black plastic skin started separating from the shoe making bubbles. my last pair were good for about a year then were not comfortable after that. but both shoes were comfortable to wear, they just were falling apart so i could not wear them at work."
2,Made me bleed,"No kidding. It did.I ordered these shoes for one of the most important interviews in my life. I was pretty happy with it when it got here, so I didn't think there would be a problem wearing them to the interview. On the morning of the interview, I ran for a bit to catch the bus, and noticed the increasingly more painful sensation coming from the back of my feet. I look and I see myself bleeding as the shoes scratched the skin above my Achilles tendon.Note that the shoes was NOT too tight for me. It was, in fact, 0.5 size bigger. Also note that I was not wearing thin socks, but rather athletic ones, and still the shoes made me bleed.Essentially, I just bought pain for $50."
2,ouch.... why can people never manage to make a good book soundtrack?....,"I listened to the samples, while some of the tracks are good music. But listening to The Trees of the Valar will make your ears bleed.... The Silmarillion, instead of reminding you of the most beautiful things in the LOTR universe, is some very, very strange atonal techno music. I really don't know what to say, some of the tracks are acceptable as music, but they remind me of a Blues band instead of ancient elvish legends....."
1,mediocre quality,"The listening section on Test 1 works fine only before the start of the test and voice is not coming up during the actual test questions. This doesn't reflect the company's professionalism, and i'm really upset about the way the software messed up with my preparation. I'm going to have to let BBB know about this complaint and let the rest of the aspirants know the mediocre quality of your product.They must have real professionals devolop these kind of products. I'm a software professional too, i really didn't expect this out of your product.Above that, the customer support is not operational 24 hrs a day, and i've been slogging these days with my preparation and could not reach your team when i really need help."
3,"Good material, but very buggy software","This software is very much like the real test, but it is pretty buggy and will crash fairly regularly. For one of the most serious problems, ETS sent a patch, but they claimed it was really a problem with my computer, even though this problems happen on every computer I've tried."
5,It's all about the journey,"Belloc shares his adventure of making a pilgrimage to Rome on foot in the early twentieth century (prior to World War I). He was ""On the Road"" fifty years before Kerouac on a spiritual journey full of faith, wit, beautiful scenery, interesting characters, and personal adventures."
1,Very Disappointing,"I just finished reading Ms. Akbari's book and I had to let everyone know just how disappointed I am. This book seems to be nothing more than just common sense and a lot of self congratulation. It was vague on almost every point on which I wish she would have expanded, the actual information that she gave was very limited and she did not bother to illustrate (literally) any of her points. Additionally, I am still not sure just what her program was, and, if I do get it, what makes it so revolutionary. Spare yourself the time and money of reading this book, and purchase something else."
3,Helpful But Not Overly So,"I looked forward to reading this book because my hair is incredibly damaged--people think I just got it cut because there is so much broken hair on my shoulders--and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to repair it and keep it healthy.While Lisa Akbari does know her stuff--and I WOULD call her a pioneer--she could have done a better job providing more helpful info. For example, I would have appreciated a list of actual product names for moisturizers or oils, since my hairdresser carries several and uses a mix of them on me. I would have expected some graphics--any graphics, but especially how to wrap my hair at night, how to make a French roll, etc. I would also have appreciated a concise, summarized step-by-step list of what to do in her ""program."" I didn't seem to get a whole lot out of it, though she certainly was thorough in her research."
2,Affirmation Guide Only!,"This book was a book on providing you with ways to recognize and get rid of negatives about your hair and replacing those with positives - words and affirmations. This book was not the info or instructional guide you would expect due to the title. There were no pictures but list upon list of negatives and corresponding positives. This book did not teach me anything as that ""negative"" cleansing for me was done when I decided to go natural and accepted my hair. This book is definitely for those really, really needing the positive support and reenforcement about their hair. This book is not for someone already rooted in a very positive ideaology about thier hair. The book also sights research done by the author but no solid evidence of what it set out to prove or how it was done etc. Just an overall weak book as everything is so very high level."
5,One of the best romance books that I've read in a long time!,"This book was so good that I couldn't put it down. It's got a lovable dog, great characters, hot men like Alex (the heroine's love interest) and his brother Max, tons of hilarious humor, steamy sex, and of course, great romance. The story is so down-to-earth, realistic and well-written that you just can't put the book down. It doesn't have all the usual, mushy baggages and drama that other typical romance books and their characters have and instead, comes across as very refreshing with a story that's not only unique but one that really grows on you as well. I read a copy of this from a local library. After reading this, I see myself making a permanent place on the bookshelf for it! -5+ stars. I look forward to more of similiar novels from Jennifer Crusie in the near future."
5,One of my favorites,Not going to write a summary of the book since it's already been covered in other reviews. But I will say that this is one of my all time faves of Jennifer Crusie! Fun and sexy! Don't hesitate to read it!
5,Charming,"Nina, 40, gets a manic-depressive dog from the pound. The dog, Fred, meets her downstairs neighbor, Alex, and brings him home. Alex, 30, is immediately attracted to his upstairs neighbor, Nina. What follows is a very charming, very funny story about two people falling in love. It's a short book. I read it in one day. Very satisfying."
5,Essential Reading for Scientific Nonbelievers,"The description of the author and book say it all. A second generation atheist and scientist who approached the topic from ""the opposite direction"". Some have criticized this book with the admonition that potential readers should simply ""stop doubting and believe""--an absurd proposition when reaching out to atheists. The OT and NT spend little time on the creation of the universe, and rightfully so. The message is the word of God, not an complete explanation of what we know of his entire creation. This book starts from the mindset of a curious nonbeliever and provides compelling evidence of God's eternal design and forces the reader to re-examine their nonbelief. He also details his own study into the religions of the world and how his study led him to become a Christian."
2,Alternative Wanna-be's,"Ok, So I bought this cd, and I regret it. After hearing their song ""Bossman"" I thought this was going to be a great new band entering the alternative world. But after listening to a variety of their songs I feel as if Lucky Boys Confusion is a boy band (ie. Backstreet, Nsync) trying to be alternative, or visa-versa. Try something else."
3,For non-Scorpions fans,"I think this is a rather ordinary collection from one of my favorite bands. The songs contained here are the same ones that will appear in most Scorps fans catalogs anyway. The one real highlight is their cover of ""Hey You"" written long ago by the Who? Anyway, semi-fans will like this CD because it does contain some of the radio landmark songs of the band, but I find it lacking the balance and different song types that their best albums feature."
5,Awesome music,If you like the Scorpions you can't go wrong with this CD. Excellent selection of all my favorites.
3,Crazy doppleganer attacks,"A role playing fantasy of a psychiatrist's wife becomes the basisfor a mistaken identity when she meets her husband's double.Worse when the double is nutsy-coo-coo ( clinical term...)and kidnaps the husband and stalks and rapes the wife Claire.Substitutes himself for the husband and gets thehusband arrested and confined ( but in his own hospital).Breaking out with help from his guard friend,the good doctor comes to the rescue.Only to get his rewards..."
5,Great 70's Horror!,I used to have nightmares after watching this one as a kid. It has a creepy feel and it's suspense is very good. I was so happy to finally own this one on DVD. It is just how I remembered it as a kid. I never really undstood why this movie is so underrated. It has to be some of the best 70's horror I have seen.
3,Interesting but I was left wanting,"I just got my hands on the Anchor Bay version of this film because I heard the new one had some transfer flaws. Although Anchor did a decent job, there was still the occasional digital aftefacts such as grain and lines. But overall, a good transfer.I originally saw this movie as a kid and found it to be too warped for my limited intelligence. Now seeing it again after so many years, I have to say ""what is the motivation behind the killings?"" They never reveal why the killer murders in the first place.This movie has to be watched more than once to appreciate what the director was trying to convey.Alice herself has the weirdest crazy looking eyes I've ever seen on a little girl. I was drawn in by those eyes. They look so crazy.Anyway, see the movie. It's worth a viewing if you're into horror or slasher flicks in general."
1,Do not be mislead.,"...If you want a movie where people die stupidly (And mostly don't die at all.) and the revelation of the movie's killer is so off the wall and dorky. Than run, don't walk and pick yourself up a brand new steamy copy of ""Alice sweet Alice.""I guess a more distinguished palate might enjoy the film's protagonists constant whining and speaker crushing screaming.But I couldn't."
2,Fairly Disappointing....,"Well, I added this movie to my wish list a few months ago because it seemed to be getting fairly good reviews from people on here...Good thing I added it to my wish list and not shopping cart that day because it wasn't really worth the four bucks I put down for it when I found it in the pawn shop here. The acting sucked, the huge fat landlord guy was a nasty guy in lots of ways (trying to get some from a kid, lets be serious here; thats a horror movie in itself...nasty). But overall the movie is too predictable...until the 'shocking' plot twist when you find out who the real killer is, then the natural reaction is pretty much ""what the hell did I just miss?"" In my opinion, don't do more than read the reviews on here. If you want a fairly good movie along the same lines...sorta...try to rent Session 9 first. I thought it was alot better, but that might just be my opinion, so RENT it dont buy it."
4,Superb !,"This is one of the few books that I have read in recent years that actually inspired me as a gay man. There is little enough out there that offers us, gays and lesbians, a spiritual life. It is in itself a good introduction to Buddhism, though lacks a lesbian perspective. Still if you are going to read anything as a gay man on Buddhism, this has to be it."
5,This CD will grow on you!!,"For the small few of you giving this CD a low rating, listen to it for a week, then come back. For those of you about to give it a low rating, DON'T DO IT YET!! Listen to it a little longer then come back to write a review. When I first listened to it I was like ""WTF?!?!"" The next day I was like ""Ah"". the third I was like ""Hmmmm"". Now I'm craving it every second of the day.This record is really a masterpiece. There are definitely hidden meanings and positive energy contained within. On a musical level, there are so many small details that you won't pick up at first, but you start to notice them in time. You will discover things each time through it.Trust me, BUY THIS RECORD!!! Support the band so that they will come back again in 5 years ;)TOOL is the greatest band currently active. Your great, great, great grandchildren will be talking about them.Witness history and get this recordP.S. The artwork/packaging is very creative."
3,pink floyd?,"Listen i love tool. from there first ""album"" opiate up to now with 10,000 days. the only thing is that i was excpecting the songs to be more like the first song on the album ""vicarious"". I was a little dissapointed after the first listen threw the album, but it's one of those albums that grows on you after you listen to a bunch of times. the whole album is very pink floydish. with random noises, trippy effects, its a stoners paradise. it is deffinetly tool, yet at the same time, not at all. but hey, atleast they didn't sell out. if you like pink floyd you'll like this album."
2,Recycled,"Aenima can make my day. 10.000 Days kills it, no matter how lovely the sun shines outside. This record annoys me so much! Every few minutes I hear stuff that's been recycled from the other, better, albums. There are less songs than soundscapes, streeeeeetched to fill the cd. I once read a review on the internet that claimed this album was a brilliant hoax, to confuse the internet-pirates. The REAL new Tool album would be coming soon. I wish it was true."
2,Sleepy Tool - Not Worth 4 Yr Hiatus,"This album is ok for Tool, it has like 3 good songs, but the rest is mostly the ambient/experimental stuff that they used as filler before. On 10,000 days, there are only 5 actual songs out of 11. Opiate was a good, raw start to Tool's music. Aenima was in my opinion their best, full of mysterious ambient rock songs. Lateralus was a very impressive album, very precise and uniquely stylish. 10,000 Days kind of sounds as if Tool just spent a couple of weeks in the studio rehashing the styles of Lateralus and Opiate together...not very impressive."
3,Mediocre,"Mediocre is about all I can say about the album, I am not saying anything bad about it and it is still better than 99% of the rock out there. However this is not typical tool and its not tool at their best, but it is a pretty good album. I gave it three stars rated against Tool, and what they can do and have done, if I were going to rate it against whats out there now, more like 4 to 4 and half stars. They are still a great band thats pretty freaking weird but this is not their best work."
3,same,"IT SOUNDS MUCH LIKE THE LAST CD.IT IS GOOD TO LISTEN TO ,BUT, SOME OF THE SAME GUITAR LICKS AS BEFORE."
2,disappointing...,"this cd was ok. most of the songs are 8, 9, or even 10 minutes long and there aren't any discernable choruses or anything catchy about them. normally i like that kind of stuff but this went waaaay to far with the jams. i think that some of these songs could have been cut down. plus most of the guitars sound the same on everything song. they almost sound like something meshuggah would have wrote. maynards voice sounds weird too. like on ""the pot"" i didnt even realize that it was him singing on it. there were only four songs on here that i really liked. 10,000 days, the pot, vicarious, and right in two were the only ones i could get into after a few listens. i know that this probably going to just get a lot of hate from all the tool fans but o well."
2,If you buy this album you are a tool.,"First of all this review is not meant for the die-hard nonthinking Tool fan because I know that you picked up this album the day it dropped. I already know how Maynard changed your life and expanded your simple horizons, as I've heard this argument from every other ""unique"" Tool fan. Spare me your time. As for the album, the songs are one-dimensional, static, repetitive, and the lyrics are surprisingly sophomoric. Nothing on the album even seems to stand out. The only thing that keeps this album from getting generic radio airplay is the fact that most songs are too long for public broadcast. This album is everything that Tool musically stood out against.The worst part of all is that much like Lateralus, the only worthwhile part of this album is the packaging. Unfortunately, a pretty package,unlike a musical masterpiece, can only entertain you for about ten minutes."
2,Lacklustre...,"I agree with most of the reviews here, too much filler, the band don't come across as interested and I found it overly boring, yeah the packaging is awesome, and a couple of tracks rock! But it doesn't take away the fact that I just blew $$$$$$ on a cd I can't listen to. I found that the album sounds like a rejected Latarlus that was scrapped then re recorded..."
5,Art Work,"Finally ""10,000 Days"" is here and I thought I would be disappointed with this album. When I first put the album in my CD player I was shocked with it. I have to say that ""10,000 Days"" blew me away like all Tool albums. I listened to every track and when I was done I listened to them again. This album is not as good as Lateralus, but it is my second favorite Tool album. Ignore the negative comments about this album, just go out and buy it you will not be disappointed."
5,AMAZING,"Tool has done it again, people who gave this album low marks are insane!Justin sounds like hes trying to murder the bass! WHAT THE HELL MAN THIS IS THE BEST BASS PLAYING I'VE EVER HEARD!!!Maynard is AWESOME as always/Adam is good but hes not as amazing as some of their other stuffDanny is and allways will be danny so not alot to say, hes great.Vicarious- 9/10Jambi- 9/10Wings Pt1- 7/10Wings pt2-10/10The Pot-10/10Lipan Conjuring (none)Lost Keys (intro to rosetta)Rosetta Stoned-10/10Right in Two-10/10(My favorite on the album)Intension-8/10Viginti Tres-(none)"
2,Blah!,"For a Tool album, this is utterly unoriginal and bland. Completely self-indulgent, it comes off as a grandiose prog-jam session by a bunch of otherwise extremely talented musicians who figured they could showcase their technical abilities instead of playing good, hard, emotional music.I had originally considered ""Lateralus"" as the album that turned me off to Tool, but that album comes off as a classic compared to this one.Oh well, at least we can credit Tool with creating the whole mallcore genre. Thanks a lot guys."
2,very disappointed,i like tool but this cd is a waste of money and time. cant believe we waited this long for a new release from them and this is what we got. there are 2 good songs on the whole cd. the rest is a bunch of rambling nonsense musically and otherwise
1,What a disappointment,This album was the biggest waste of 10 dollars in the world!!! You would be better off burning 10 bucs than buying this horrible album. Download the songs before you buy.
3,"Not a bad album, but not a great one either","I've been a Tool fan for a while, and was pretty much foaming at the mouth when I learned of a new CD. When I bought it, I was let down a bit. Others have highlighted the CD overall, so I'll leave that be. I think one of the main turnoffs for me is that 10,000 days does sound a lot like Lateralus, and maybe a bit too much like Lateralus. For the best example, I point to Vicarious. It is a good song, but it reminds me too much of Schism. It has similar riffs and some of the same movements within it. In small ways it sounds like they just dissected Schism, changed a few things around, and put it back together in a different order, different notes and chords, and new lyrics. Granted, the whole cd does not sound like Lateralus. I personally couldn't get over the resemblance though. Maybe a few more listen-throughs and I will think differently."
5,STILL listening to this album!,"The last reviewer stole my thunder somewhat.The previous two Tool records had songs on them that I really didn't discover until a year or so later. '10,000 Days' is a little different asI got into the songs immediately and haven't got sick of them yet.What makes this my favorite Tool record is that there more songswhich I like as compared to the three of four on 'Aenima' & 'Lateralus'.Standouts tracks are 'Vicarious' and 'Rosetta Stoned'"
3,Its not all that good....,As a Tool & Perfect Circle fan I'm underwhelmed with this CD. Only 2 maybe 3 good songs in here. Sorry. But its true.
5,great album,"Wings for Marie sounds like the perfect soundtrack for Donnie Darko. All you people who say this isn't heavy don't know the meaning of the word heavy. Older Tool may have been more aggressive, but 10,000 Days is easily their darkest, deepest, ""heaviest"" album to date. To be honest, I probably prefer Lateralus, but that doesn't mean that 10,000 Days isn't awesome in it's own right. Just give it a chance."
4,Awesome disc!,"While this isn't ?nima (which I don't think can be topped by Tool), I think this has a very ?nima feel to it and has quickly made it up to my #2 Tool disc. Lateralus was good but too much ambience and while this one has it's share I am able to listen to it over and over much like I did ?nima when it was released and this will be getting a lot of listening time."
1,Tool is dead,"No hunger, no honesty, no need to make music anymore for the sake of self expression.Sounds to me like they got together in the studio because they have signed a contract over a number of recordings for their label. Simply money-making. Fake-Tool, eyes on black ground are not enough.I guess Maynard wanted to go home to APC as soon as he could, ""let`s get over and done with it""I don`t want to listen to music which is ""produced"" just for commercial reasons. I want to hear things from people who have something to say. Tool is dead, they have nothing more to say."
1,Eh- over it,You know- waiting for Tool albums to come out is like waiting for Heley's commet to make an appearance. This album is OK- but for the wait- its kinda bad. If you want it- get it- who cares- but this album is not that great- I listened to it twice- and never again. Some cool guitar parts- thats all- a lot of filler- and some nasty songs spread throughout. Yuck.
1,Tool is finished,"I couldn't tell if it was Godsmack, Tool , or Disturbed waste your $10 then take your pick. A Perfect Tool is Finished."
1,"Buy one Tool disc, you've heard them all","This disc blows. i can't believe all those Tool fanatics that swing from these guys nuts. Every Tool album sounds the same, the production is the same, sounds the same, same rehash riffs. Adam Jones is meticulous in the studio but can't come up with something better than this every 5 years. Maynard thinks he is so ultracool but really he's just an ugly blad guy with a god complex. Like I said, if you've heard Undertow you've heard this crap. Mathmatics have no place in rock Adam."
3,Am I the only one that thinks this album is mediocre?,"Don't get me wrong.. I absolutely loved Tool's 3 previous albums. Aenima is probably my favourite album of all time. But...10000 days just doesn't have the epic feel that their previous 2 did.Vicarious is an amazing song, but I'd say its the only great song on the album. Rosetta stoned and 10000 days give the album one star, vicarious gives it 2, therefore a rank of 3.I expected more from Tool...maybe it will grow on me, but I'll need to get over the initial disappointment,"
3,Getting In Touch With Your Inner Bitch,"I read this book years ago, and it was humorous and very helpful. I would have given that edition 5 stars. However, this edition was printed in a light pink font making it very hard on the eyes. I wanted to reread it before sending it to a friend as a gift. Instead, I returned it."
4,Very enlightening...how wonderful the inner bitch can be..,"I have spent my whole life being nice and worrying about what other people think. It's nice to finally see that it's ok to say ""I don't think so"", to the people who take advantage of you. Toxic niceness is definitely something that has to be stopped. It's time women stand up for what they want and what they don't want. I loved the book..."
1,Makes you wonder,"Western women keep publishing garbage like this book, and then they wonder why Western men are so reluctant to marry them."
1,Epidemic,"What is the deal with all the ""b"" books these days? It seems like that characteristic is viewed as a quality to be proud of now, rather than something to be ashamed of. When did being a ""b"" become a good thing? Must have been while I was sleeping.I think the world would be a lot better place if people would stop using the ""b"" word and stop being proud of having the qualities of a ""b""."
4,A Worthy Introduction,"I read this book in its original printing back in the 1980s -- when it was my original introduction to both George and Lisa. It was also one of my early forays into fantasy & sci-fi as a teenager. Absolutely loved it -- very much related to the main character. So I'd highly recommend for other girls at that stage in their life.We all know both authors have only gotten better as time's gone on, but this is a great intro to both of their styles. Complex characters, a well-wrought world (I have a special love for what seems like fantasy but is really sci-fi), exciting and quiet moments both deftly handled, and the kinds of conflicting motivations you see later in Game of Thrones, etc. I was thrilled with this one the first time I read it -- but now, yes, I'll admit that it's not as sophisticated as later works. Isn't that the nature of an evolving author? Very interesting, really, to see the stylistic roots of what we know and love now."
2,Not up to par,"While eager to jump into the pages of ""Windhaven"" by George RR Martin and Lisa Tuttle, I found my first disappointment in my fantasy-fiction idol wherein George fails to deliver. I found myself questioning his acceptance in permitting his name to be published on the cover. While interesting in concept, I found it supremely disappointing in style, depth of character and plot line. The idea is intriguing, but fails to evoke the slightest emotional response from the reader throughout all the chapters of the main character's life. I turned the final page without the twinge of regret I typically experience to finish a book. George RR Martin may have his name on the cover, but none of the depth of character fans have come to know and love about his writing lies between the pages.My vote: one thumb sideways. Eager to start a new book and get the bland taste out of my mouth...."
2,Martin???,"I'm an avid Sci-Fi reader that loves authors such as: Martin, Eddings, Jordan and Cook. I would be very surprised/disappointed if George R.R. Martin had much to do with this book. Boring topic/story. I almost didn't finish it(a sin in my book.) Would not recommend even as a casual read."
5,IOGear USB SD Reader/writer GFR202SD,I purchased a SanDisc 4 GB SDHC card for my camera. At the time it did not occur to me that neither my SanDisc Image Mate 6 in 1 nor my SIIG 18-in-1 Reader/Writer would not be able to read this new version of Secure Digital. Long story short-I called IOGear tech support and was assured that this reader would work although netiher their promotional materails nor their packaging indicates that it will. Bottom Line: It works and it was a very inexpensive ($10 at CompUSA) solution to my problem.
3,Inspiring Fair read,This book has an important message with some great stories. Takes lots of excess words to share this message though.
4,Too Small to Ingnore,This book is inspirational. How different the world would be if we treated all children with the honor and dignity they deserve.
2,This is NOT the full concert!,"In spite of the warnings in other reviews, I purchased this album because the live special was so funny. I'm sorry to say I am very dissapointed. Many of the most funny parts of the full concert are not included on this album. For example, mother and the kids at mall, working at McDonalds, they are omitted. The CD is still funny, but if you are looking for the entire routine, you will be very disappointed in this album."
3,"Okay, certain songs are better than others","The best songs here are Bird Song, Let It Grow and Help On The Way/Slipknot->Franklin's Tower. The rest seems forgettable. Part of the problem with this release was that at the time there were still many songs that hadn't been used on live albums but unfortunatly half the songs here had already appeared elsewhere. This was also recorded during the time when the band was bringing back songs that hadn't been played in years and with the exeception of Help/slip none of that appears on here. All this has changed in recent years with the release of vault tapes."
2,Not my favorite album,"While I'm a fan of the early GD, rarely listening to anything recorded after 1972, I gave this one a try and was fairly disappointed. Every band evolves with time as do the members, but there is something to be said for the early GD that can't be said for their later work. The sound of the late 70's to the early 90's is vastly different from the blues/folk beginnings of the band. There are more instruments, electronics, and members of the band that I think take away from what the GD were...... a simple band, making complex songs and jams with a certain ""feel"" to them. The feel is lost behind the synthesizers and electronic sound of this album. Needless to say I will be passing this album on to someone who appreciates this period of the GD sound and will go back to listening to Pigpen, Jerry, and the boys singing and playing about simpler times."
5,Madoff has got to be type cast in here,I am amazed at how this book covers character study and predicts Madoff's character for me once I saw his signature on a legal document!
1,There are better books than this one,Explanations and definitions are there - but I did not find the book's images and diagrams helpful. Book is only informative but not clearly descriptive - there are better ones out there.
3,they will be on their way,"Singers are made by the writers that portray their talent in an appealing way. Sometimes the singers are stuck with writers that have not mastered this art yet. This cd fits that bill. The girls can sing,dont get me wrong 1000 palabras is my favorite.A mix of two languages that flows back and forth, was a good blend,rarely done in mainstream pop. But there are some bubble gum songs too. Harmony is good. I look forward to the next more mature album. They have staying power if they can get the rightproducers and writers."
4,Edens Crush Is The Best Group Ive Ever Heard !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When First Heard Get Over Yourself I Really Wanted to Get The Album And When I got It I was Hooked to it such great songs and great girls I just saw them perform they were so great I hope they have a concert of their own in San Diego.I like all their songs but I don't really like the spanish ones but other than that all their other songs are GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,I really been enjoying my Cd i've been playing one song to death I love it sooo very much...,"I love it very much.. It's the best cd, espeially one song..the song keep playing in my head while i'm working or doing things on the computer..."
4,Recommended for new and younger Christians,"Author Colin Smith takes a very high level overview of the Bible story in his book Unlock the Bible in 30 Days. The book provides a view of the Bible as a consistent story with mountain peak highs followed by low valleys. Throughout the book part of the focus is on pointing out a single thread flowing through the Bible. That single thread is a plan of redemption. The book is divided into three parts with part 1 covering the Old Testament, part 2 covering the New Testament, and part 3 dealing with living in the Spirit.For most people who have been Christians for a long time this is too general a view of the Bible and will provide nothing they don't already know. However, for young Christians or a class for new Christians Unlock the Bible in 30 Days is a recommended read that ties the various Bible stories into a consistent theme."
1,not made well,We had this prodcut 2 days and the white feathers came out and the tinker jewel picture fell off. Would not purchase again.
1,Poor construction,"Shortly after receiving these slippers, one of the pendants fell off the foot. Looks like it was tacked on with elmers glue. Horrible construction, cheap product. Shoes were supposed to be for a toddler, but they were WAY too big for my 4 year old."
4,Ballet slippers are great!,"This slippers are a bit big for my daughter, but they are cute and they are going to complete her Tinkerbell costume for Halloween perfectly. I am going to slip them over her sneakers for Halloween so her feet are warm, and the slippers don't trip her up. Great buy for the cost."
2,Mingle - Chillout,"I'd heard one song from this album (Blue Skies) as a background for a video and relentlessly chased down the name of it for 6 months until I found it. I thought, wow, this song is so great, I'm sure the rest of the album (or other songs by this group) must be fabulous. The other reviews on here seemed to indicate that. I was positively salivating when the CD arrived. I immediately popped it into my computer for a listen, and I am sorry to report, was VERY disappointed. Every song sounds exactly like the others -- seems like same key, same type of instrumentals, same type of vocals. Perhaps taken separately, the songs are OK but together, to me anyway, they became unlistenably boring very quickly."
4,funny beyond belief,"This disc is a most unusual collection of very funny, life situation commentaries, worth a good listen."
1,Not Worth It......Color Wears Easily,"This hard plastic cover is very easy to install and gives a bit of protection to the phone without being too thick and heavy. Though I agree with the other reviewers here that the pinwheel design and clip is very poor, I feel the fact that the color chips away over a very short period of time is more of a reason to look else wear. The black color on the shell comes off and scratches very easily, and over a period of just a couple of months looks cheap and ugly. Underneath the black coating is a silver metallic cover that makes the scratches very obvious. And it doesn't take a while for the scratches to appear. No matter how careful you are this cover will look like hell in just a couple of months. Pass these up...."
5,"Why We Are a Family, 100 reasons","I first saw the book at a Meijer store and purchased one for myself. I enjoyed it so much that I showed it to my daughter. She immediately wanted her own copy, so I had to buy one for each of my four children and one for my grandson and his fiancee. However, when I went back to purchase them, the store shelf was bare.It is a beautiful book that echoes the way our family feels about each other and things that we do. I plan to write alongside each picture about our family traditions and put a picture of the family member it brings to mind. I highly recommend the book to families who are close, loving and make sure they know each others' business at all times."
2,Is NOT nonglare,"Nor does the product claim to be nonglare, or antiglare. But it came up third on a list when I searched Amazon for nonglare film. Immediately below it was film that is nonglare, and immediately above it was a nonglare film for a computer monitor or a telephone, I forget which. In other words, Amazon's search engine sucks. Guess I'll have to be a lot more careful next time.Oh, and in case anyone wonders, the film certainly isn't 2mm thick. That might be too thick to be described as ""film,"" anyway. It's 2mm thick, as clearly indicated in the specs. I suppose it was someone at Amazon that didn't know the difference, so Amazon is showing it as considerably thicker than it actually is."
4,Solid Introductory Investment Textbook,"Mayo's ""Investments"" captures nearly all the relevant subjects in an increasingly complex financial frontier from simple debt instruments and equity issues to complex option strategies. I would have liked to see further mention of hedge funds though, as significant money seems to be pouring into these instruments and the student of investing would gain by knowing more about the various strategies they employ and the trading mechanisms used. Ditto for Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). With that said, though, Mayo does a fine job providing a comprehensive basis on the investment world. Solid reference book. Strong 4 Stars."
3,Still like the C-Ya album better,I really like Ron-C's first album C-Ya and to me that is still his best album. There were a few songs on this album I just didn't care for. Still ok for the Ron-C fan.
2,The folly of the continuity thesis,"This book is a simpleminded defence of the continuity thesis. Wallace's attempt to establish a continuity is restricted to Galileo's early notebooks, which were related to his teaching. Therefore, at best, this establishes a continuity between medieval science and Galileo's *teaching,* not Galileo's *actual science.* This form of the ""continuity thesis"" (the only form defended here) is the most banal truism imaginable. What else was he supposed to teach? Of course he did not have his own theory at this early stage. So of course he had to rely on various authorities. Nowhere is there any argument that this has the slightest relevance for understanding Galileo's mature science. Instead Wallace spends all his time on various baroque linguistic analyses intended to show that in the notebooks Galileo was plagiarising one mediocre and irrelevant author rather than another."
1,Poor guality plug with no battery backup,"I received a PhotoShare Digital photo Album as a gift for Christmas. I loved it! Three days after Christmas, while I was putting the plug into the album, the tip of the plug seems to have broken off!! Now the plug will not work and a battery was not included. Unless Photoco Inc. is willing to replace the unit at no cost, I will no longer have an album. Regardless, I will be out shipping, insurance, etc!! I would have given this 5 stars after three days. After it quit, it is not worth one star!!!"
1,There are much better out there,"This is obviously a rapidly evolving technology. There are many variations of features among the units out there. This one particularly is a shame they did not at least make the battery compartment take standard AA batteries if you do not want to buy the custom factory battery. Also, it does not show ALL jpeg files. I owned one of these for one day and it will not show photos from a camera phone, as well as some other versions of jpg files. The menu system was not user friendly."
2,What a disappointment...,"I purchased this product for my parents so that they could display pictures of their grandchildren as well as take them with them as they travel quite a bit. It sounded like a great idea.I loaded the memory stick (which had to be later extracted with pliers), and to my dismay, the photo quality was dismal. It looked like digital photography 10 years ago, before the megapixel cameras. It is nothing I would feel proud to give as a gift.In addition, to scroll from one picture to the next took several seconds. The plastic frame that was included (which the unit can be placed into for desktop viewing) was made of the cheapest plastic imaginable.Don't waste your money! Young children might find it amusing, but most adults would be disappointed. There are many other very fine photo frames with excellent quality in this price range.Sometimes novelty comes with a price, in this case, loss of quality."
4,What Goes Around Comes Around,"Ms. Woolridge did an excellent job with Read Between the Lies. The three main characters, Felicia, Gabrielle and Stephanie each carried an array of secrets. I feel they each got what they deserved in the end especially the biggest deceiver of all. I must admit that this novel touched me to the core. I love to read, always have, always will but knowing that there are so many out there who can't just blows me away. Illiteracy is a real problem in this country but a curable one. Who knows why so many people fall through the cracks and never get the reading skills required but these individuals should never be ashamed or think of themselves as being stupid - all they need to do ask for help, I know it's not easy but there are many programs available to assist non-readers and shame should never be a option. As I stated previously I was touched deeply by this novel."
5,An Absolute Page Turner,"""Read between the lines"" was a very, very entertaining and pressure pumping. I say pressure pumping because it made you want to reach in the book and strangle Stephanie's character. This novel is so captivating you will not be able to part from it easily. I suggest you be prepared to be up until the wee hours of the morning reading this novel. You will tell yourself ""I will only read one more chapter"" but by the time you realize it, you would have read ten. Trust me, you will not want the 384 pages of this novel to come to an end.I commend the author for not using slang, broken english or profanity in her writing. The absense of these distracting and annoying attributes made this novel flow perfectly and very easy to read.I suggest you run not walk to the nearest book store to get your copy."
4,GOOD READING,"READ BETWEEN THE LIES was a very interesting book 3 women whose lives are joined together through the art of modeling and public relations. Gabrielle lives with a secret which she fears if and when she does become sucessful would destroy her. Felicia has martial problems of trying to become her own person with something that she can identify with but her husband, Trace, wants her to become a mom and devot all of her time to the home and him. Then there is Stephanie, who wants it all and will not stop at nothing to get it, even if it means destroying friendships. I liked this book, but I was more drawn to Felicia, who tried to satisfy her husbands wants but still took the chance to give her self a profession for herself. To me this was a good book, quick in reading did not drag but kept moving."
5,An outstanding book!!!,"I just got through reading this book, it was outstanding. I know that Lori Bryant Woolridge will have much success, she is an outstanding author. The book kept my attention throughout its entirity. I am hoping that there will be a sequel, but if not I know that there will be much more to come from Lori Bryant Woolridge. I reccommend this to anyone who loves to read. Much success and blessings to Lori Bryant Woolridge."
2,Waste of money,Not worth the money for the amount of information contained the the book. Photos nice but thye won't help you muich.
1,disappointing,Product does not look like the photo. Very small - mesh sits too close to face for comfort. Would only use in an extreme emergency. Not comfortable for any extended period of outdoor work in buggy conditions. Very disappointing.
3,Rizzoli & Isles,"I love the show. But I wish it was more like the books.Its a G rated show, The books are rated R."
5,great season finale,"Unlike my wife, who is a dedicated viewer of Rizzoli and Isles, I do not watch this series on a regular basis. But because I had to take care of procuring and accessing the final season episode for her, which she missed due to vacation, I ended up watching it. Am I glad I did. It was riveting and totally held my interest. Can't wait for next season."
1,"Good song, broken disc!",The disc was broken into when I got it. Otherwise I love this song and would recommend this to anyone.
1,Finding God's Peace....,This book was not read by me. It was ordered in error and I had ordered several for book club friends. It was a fiasco trying to return them!
5,Hint of sweetness,"The Dr. Kracker Snacker, Spelt Muesli Stick provide the same great taste and crunch as their other products, but with a hint of sweetness due to the bits of dried fruit in the cracker. Their smaller sizes makes them suitable for a quick snack and they are very filling. The amount of carbohydrates in each is very small in comparison to other snack crackers."
2,"Portable and Handy, More Copyediting Needed!","This is a handy printed version of the MSDN online help, but still full of errors. It is nice to be able to carry around for tutorial reading. The main complain about the printed version is the lack of the copyedit process. It's just a strainght port of the online manual without error corrections. Even the first application sample in the book contains the exact same errors of the online help. This's very unfortunate considering that the Microsoft Press had the opportunity to correct those errors easily."
5,Great for beginner law enforcement students,"Great for beginner law enforcement students who are interested on Law and crime , society and crime, and people relation to crime. Getting a Degree in Administartion fo justice and will recommend this book to all of criminal law students."
3,A dull fairy tale of a novel. :-(,"The book seemed to please comic book fans more than everyday readers. Superman was this big hero and everyone liked him, except for a few people. The book was dully enjoyable and moved at a decent pace."
5,If you love comics...,"This is a great book for any comic fan, young and old. I couldn't put the book down when I originally read it and I loved it soo much that I read it a second time. This is a great book for any comic fan...I give this book 5 stars."
2,I just couldn't bear to listen...,"It's a pity... Rattle and Hum has a few things that sound like they were almost worthy of offering, but the vast, vast majority of the album plays like a bad bootleg. I suppose if you'd been to the tours, you'd like this album better, but I just couldn't bear listening to many of the songs on this album.I guess you really had to be there to appreciate this album. I couldn't.(On the plus side, though, there's a pretty nice live version of ""Pride (In The Name Of Love) on here...)"
1,Looking For Better Song Seliction,"Hi....I love U2, but: I was hoping for more hit songs on this CD. I'd love to see a compilation CD of all their top hits. It took the purchase of two CD's to get all the songs I really like. Maybe some day they will come out with one.Best Regards...."
3,"Interesting, if unessential.","This live/studio disc is a mixed bag. I loved the cover 'Helter Skelter' as well as other rarities like 'Hawkmoon 269' and 'Van Dieman's Land'. But the live version of 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' is pretty weak IMO. 'Desire' is not the best track on this disc but it seems to be the only one ever played, which is unfortunate. 'Angel of Harlem' is a good track too. The main problem with this disc is that it is compiled from such a variety of sources that it runs very uneven. It seems like it was rushed out in order to maximize the bands popularity after 'The Joshua Tree'. Yet for all it's flaws it remains a sort of 'snapshot in time' for the band, showing them and their music to be a work in progress. Interesting from that standpoint, but not terribly compelling."
2,Not An Island - Cheap Back,"We were attracted to the appearance, size, use of hardwood and shape of this piece and expected high quality from Michael Scott.From three sides, it is a very attractive piece. However, the back side is a cheap piece of plywood that is stained in a different color from the rest and has no grain or antique finish to match the rest of the piece. Because it is supposed to be a kitchen island, this cheap side is always visible.In our case, the back side plywood did not fill the space leaving an opening. A replacement is being shipped to us. Also the overall fit of the entire unit was not quite square so it does have some minor flaws with fit.We are very disappointed because it had such great potential to meet our needs."
3,Good book but needs more examples.,"This is a good, general book on the PFC for developers not familiar with it. What would greatly benefit the reader would be a lot more real-world examples."
3,Steve Winwood - Chronicles,"A good CD with important songs in the career of Steve Winwood. It's worth as a collection, but does not represent the best work. There are hit songs of the 80s. Good!"
2,"They Didn't Call This ""The Best of..."" For a Reason","""Chronicles"" attempts to anthologize only four albums. Despite its minimal scope, it fails miserably. While it includes the biggest hits from ""Arc of a Diver"" (""While You See a Chance""), ""Taking Back to the Night"" (""Valerie""), and ""Back in the High Life"" (""Higher Love""), it fails to include Steve's three follow-up Top 10 hits from the latter album (""Freedom Overspill,"" the title track, and ""The Finer Things""). Instead, it inexplicably includes several of Steve's worst solo recordings (""Spanish Dancer,"" ""My Love's Leavin',"" etc.).One almost has to conclude that Island Records intentionally left off several of Steve's best songs so that ""Chronicles"" wouldn't hurt sales of his other releases.""Chronicles"" isn't ""The Worst of Steve Winwood,"" but it's close."
2,Just a tease,"This release only covers Winwood's work on Island. It is missing most of the key tracks from his solo career. An all encompassing retrospective is needed. In fact, I've saved Steve the time and picked the songsTalking Back to the NightWhile You See a ChanceDon't You Know What the Night can doValerieFiner ThingsFreedom OverspillRoll With itWhy Don't we Live TogetherHigher LoveBack in the High LifeOne and Only ManLord of the StreetsHolding OnVacant ChairYou can see by the songs listed here and missing from Chronicles, that this cd is merely a sampler and not a true ""Chroncile"" If you are looking for a ""greatest hits"" you could probably buy Roll With It, Back in the Highlife, and Arc of a Diver.This cd is ok, but nowhere near what it needs to be."
4,Good quality luggage at decent price,"No surprises here, I got just what I expected when ordering the SwissGear 21"" upright suitcase. Decent quality construction, tough exterior that looks like it will stand up to tests of most airline baggage handlers, and plenty of pockets to put all my stuff. The handle is comfortable and tall enough for me to use without stooping over (at 6'5"" this can be an issue), and I like the way it stands upright leaning forward on the wheels. The one drawback I can see is that the handle takes up a lot of real estate inside the luggage, so you lose a good 1 1/2 to 2 inches of space in the bottom when you're packing. I think the same can be said of most upright suitcases though."
4,Do the job,"This bar kit works as expected. The curl bar works well, but the dumbelss seem a little long and awkward."
2,Would You Like Some Sauce With Your Cheese?......,"If I had to use any word to describe this game: ""Cheese"", and lots of it. Graphics are okay. I don't understand ""walls and fences"" IN SPACE, that part doesn't make sense; especially in a supposedly ""3D"" environment. Next, this game is NOT ""3D"", it's ""2D""E having a couple of zoom and tilt options, but that is it. Homeworlds Cataclysm, a great game, now that is ""3D""! OutForce...Eis a ""Poor-mans"" version of Warcraft. Other than that, the picture on the box was pretty neat... Talk to ya, BigDaddy"
5,Great white noise for travel,"We use a more expensive white noise generator at home, and I bought this one for travel. It outperforms the larger, more expensive one in quality. It offers only two varieties, but the permutations for frequency (high/low) give considerable variety in the tones offered. Volume control also is variably up to quite a high level (too loud for us to sleep!). It would be nice if it were capable of battery power, but even with AC power, it comes in a compact and convenient travel case. If it proves to be durable (I've had it only a month), this is a great buy."
3,noise machine,everything is fine with the exception that you can't use batteries. You have to plug it in which limits its use. Otherwise it is fine.
4,Marsona sound machine,"This unit is much better than the cheaper ones that loop a 5 second sound clip (very annoying), and because of that it is worth the high price. My only complaints are with the on/off switch: first it feels VERY cheap; it doesn't have the quality inspiring feel that something that costs $70 should; it feels like it is going to fail in a week- but it's lasted a year so far. Second, the on/off switch is underneath and can't be seen without picking up the device and tilting it- a terrible design for a consumer product that will be turned on/off daily; this is inexcusable, especially at this price level. The 4 stars are because of the high price and the terrible on/off switch.Even with its faults, I am still buying another one because the sound function is what matters the most."
5,Going to buy a second one,"I purchased this for my husband because he travels a lot, doesn't sleep well in loud motel rooms and is used to using a sound machine at home. I have been using the machine in my bedroom at home and travel for myself. I am going to purchase a second machine so we won't have to share :)"
5,Better than a fancier machine.,"I bought this for ambient night noise while I'm sleeping after having previously purchased a Marsona that had all kinds of fancy sounds on it. I've had this for eight years and it works better than the more elaborate machine. I notice a lot of doctor offices use it too. It only has two settings, ""surf"" and ""rain/waterfall."" The problem with the surf is that the sound is intermittent, maybe nice for relaxation but not sound blockage. It's a very small size and so ideal for traveling."
2,Sound machine not loud enough,"I just got this to replace an Ecotones machine [ASIN:B002SMJQT4 Ecotones Sound + Sleep Machine, Model ASM1002] that quit after a power fluctuation. This new one is not satisfactory because it isn't loud enough. It only has three sounds--surf, waterfall, and rainfall. The sound on the ""surf"" setting almost disappears as the surf ebbs. The loudest setting is for the rainfall. But at the loudest, the rainfall sound is too highly pitched, and almost hurts your ears. I would recommend you try something else if you really need a loud white noise to cover sounds at night."
4,Good Product Marpac TSC 330,My son had a Marpac product that does white noise only. It worked just great and blocked out a lot of background noise. I thought it would work to block out snoring. It worked just fine and made it possible to stand the noise. I ordered the 330 because it offered some other things beside just white noise. The surf sound is the one my wife and I like the best.
4,Glad we picked Marpac TSC 330 Travel Sound Conditioner,"The decision to purchase this model was based on all the folks that had previously reviewed this product. I agree with all of them with respect to the price, a bit expensive for what it does. Overall, I would rate the marpac a 5 if not for the price. I've seen other models at Walmart etc.. but I think this one is worth the extra money.We use ours nightly and so far, not one problem."
4,Games come to life with this kit!,"This kit has greatly improved my gaming experience. Monster Cable is such a quality product. The picture is much clearer and crisp and the audio sounds awesome, especially hooked up to surround sound. I wish the cables were a little shorter. But if you're someone that has to have the unit right by your feet, you will enjoy the amount of cable that is supplied. I will be looking to use Monster Cable for all my future gaming needs."
1,Terrible cables,"Normally in a review about a cable I would mention something about picture quality and sound. However, these cables never even got me that far. The cable fit nice and smooth into the back of my ps2. The problem was trying to get the inputs the back of the tv. Simply stated, they were not the right size. I tried shoving the first 2 into the component inputs and with great force they somewhat wiggled in. I started on my 3rd and then decided to stop because it wasn't worth the risk of breaking my tv. How a company like Monster can make a set of cables that do not correctly fit into a standard sized input is ridiculous. Do not buy these cables. Obviously some people have gotten them to work, but I read about two other people having this problem, and some people having a problem on the other end of the cord where the plug goes into the ps2. It is just not worth it. Buy the component cable that is approved by Sony."
1,WHAT A HORRIBLE WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY,"Wow, how bad can Monster be?? I don't think I have any problem with my Ps2 or my brand new Panasonic HD Plasma, it has to be this cable. BRAND NEW, straight out their box it did not work - heard the sound but picture was a bazaar goobletygook on screen. Assuming it was a faulty cable I returned it to Monster, they sent another BRAND NEW one back and you guessed it - IT DID THE SAME THING!! Wow that was incredibly dissapointing. Don't know if I'll ever bother with Monster again."
1,Terrible!,DO NOT BUY THIS!!! it didnt work right out of the packaging. Im an intelligent person and have a brand new flat screen. I know how to install a basic component cable and also check to see if its damaged. Wasted forty dollars.
2,"This is a repackage, buy the orginal.","Chip Ingram has a nice radio show and is an interesting preacher but he's no Donald Barnhouse. Buy Barnhouse's original Invisible War, it's a classic. Barnhouse has a reputation for being deep but that isn't true. He takes the time to spell out his thoughts and there are plenty of eye openers to be had. He writes in a classical style but remember he was preaching the sermons this book summarizes in the 1920's & 1930's. His book is 288 pages with text from the top to bottom of each page not 40 pages of text spread over 180 pages of clip art and blank spaces.Ask yourself a question ""you think Chris Ingram's book will be in print in 70years?"" Barnhouse's is."
3,"Great Sim, but flawed","This is a terrific flight simulator, but it has some serious flaws. Because the world is modeled as flat, long flights do not function properly. Distant bearings are often not correct, one can't fly over the dateline, and worst of all, the ground shakes violently after significant distances are flown. In addition, though the flight model is vastly better than most sims, there are problems in the flight model that prevent acrobatic manuvers in planes that should should be able to handel them (loops don't work well at all). Finaly, the scenery is bland and although there are tools to improve it, the tools are themselves quite limited. There is hope, though, because Laminar Research is constantly adding to and fixing X-Plane. Perhaps a round world and acrobatics are in X-Plane's future. Only the developer knows for sure."
1,DO NOT buy this item,Purchased item in February and fur on inside of bottom of slipper is worn out! I use them as inside slippers for around the house wear. I have had similar slippers at half this price last 1 1/2 to 2 years. These just made it four months.
1,not for me!!!!,"Maybe this one works better on someone with a different body chemistry. But even with reapplying, this one doesn't last me until lunch time."
5,Take a chance on me!,"OK, I bought this camera when it was an AMAZON ""Hot Buy!"" One of my techie co-workers came running up to me and yelled, ""Don't come crying to me when the lens falls out!!"" Ha ha ha... It has 2+ megapixels and is perfect for around the house, at award ceremonies, for newsletters, websites and of course, EBAY.I broke the Nikon 775 - the... digital camera, I borrowed from work. Yes that camera had better software - but it stops THERE.The ARGUS is very compact, has an LCD screen and once you buy an additional card and card reader... you are SET to run with the big dogs!If you decide in a year or two you have gone PRO, then by all means, [get] a NIKON, but for your learning phase, this camera ROCKS!"
3,Good pics but ridiculous battery life,"This is a nice camera for the price, but definitely has some issues. The camera has produced some nice pictures, even at the low resolution setting, and in fairly dim conditions. But I agree with previous reviewer who said that it's hard to tell if the camera is on or off half the time. But the big problem with the camera is battery life, which is just plain awful. Granted, I've been using the flash and the LCD screen, but the camera has gone through TWO sets of Duracell batteries after about 20 high-res pictures and about 40 low-res pictures. Plan on buying rechargeable batteries and a recharger, and maybe an AC adapter, too.Another problem: the camera would not format or use the Simple Tech Compact Flash card I ordered with it, but the person at the Argus tech support line (toll-free) was very helpful. I was told that this camera IS NOT COMPATIBLE with Simple Tech brand cards, so beware if you're buying a compact flash card, too."
2,Nice pictures.. battery life is short among other things,"I wanted to upgrade to a newer camera, but can't afford to pay [$] or more for a better camera. So, I figure I'd try Argus' DC3500... It takes nice pictures even in low light. That is about the only thing I liked on it.Batteries lasted only a couple of days. They give you 4 AAA Kodak batteries. You'd probably have better luck with rechargeables.When you want to download the pictures to your computer, you have to plug it in with the USB and go into a temporary folder, that pops up, to get them. Then you have to save them to another folder on your computer or in MGI PhotoSuite to be able to do anything with them. REASON: when you disconnect the camera, the folder disappears. (They tell you this in the manual)Overall, I liked my Kodak DC3200 1.2 MP digital camera better. It didn't have good resolution, but was more user friendly."
5,Peaceful Oasis,I often have need of some calming and peaceful music to quiet my soul. This CD fits the bill. I love the bird songs throughout the music that makes me feel like I am in serene park just taking time to be still.
5,The Pain and the Great One,Excellent book and great pictures. Good story for children as well as adultsto use in understanding the love God has for us but how we sometimes see thingswith a selfish slant. Arrived in good condition and ahead of schedule. I was thrilled.
1,Predictable and plodding,"Did something I never do and tossed this after the first 150 pages. The writing is torturously bad, the dialogue is painful, and the characters are cardboard."
3,Okay but Great,This book was pretty boring and I had to make myself read it until I reached somewhere around page 200 and the book started speeding up. The book turned out to be pretty great! So anyway it is worth getting if you can stick with it.
3,Off to a good start.,"Being the first in Pearson's Lou Boldt series, I would say he is off to a good start. With a serial killer they have dubbed 'The Cross Killer' loose on the streets, Boldt and his team must leave no stone unturned. Boldt is walking around looking tired and scruffy, having problems in his marriage, and is constantly on the outs with a colleague with whom there is no love lost. Despite this, Boldt must muster the energy to get cracking on this case or risk being taken off it. Pearson's Boldt series has the potential to be a top-notch thriller series. I look forward to reading more by this author."
4,Raw and Emotional,"I remember the first time I heard Melissa on the radio here in L.A., J.J. Jackson on the for EDGE saiud that he was about to play an artist that was going to be big. The song was Brin Me Some Water. I was hooked to say the least. The album is a very promising debut by a great live performer and a person who sings from the heart. What Melissa has going for her is that she knows how to connect with the lister on songs like Like the Way I do and Occasionally. If you are going to buy a Melissa album for the first time, I would not start here. It may be a little raw for an introduction. I would first reccommend Yes I Am or Brave and Crazy."
4,make me a day...,"As much as I love 1,000 Oceans, I think the real gem of this single is the b-side, Baker Baker (live). The emotion behind this song is overwhelming - it's just so beautiful."
5,Makes your life easy,This is just an awesome product. It works seamlessly and gives you excact location to park the car in the garage. The wife loves it and we have more room in the garage to move around as cars are parked perfectly each and every time.
1,Poor quality...Horrible Product,"This was a defective product from the first day. When I first turned it on, everything worked great. Less than ten minutes later, it was useless. One of the laser wouldn't turn on and then it began to turn on intermittently. The other laser was really bright at first and then was so dim I couldn't see it on my car anymore. I tried using both the battery and I tried plugging it in. Both power options produced the same result. It seems like a great concept, but this is a horrible, cheaply built product. Spend a little more money and get a product that works for more than ten minutes."
2,Not flexible enough,"This unit is a two-car unit but, when placed above and in front of the dashboard area of the cars, the laser lights don't pivot far enough to reach the center dashboard area of both cars. This comprises the ability to see the laser beam easily. Otherwise, it works as stated."
3,Garage Laser Light Review,"This was my 2nd purchase of a laser light. The 1st works great. However, laser for this 2nd purchase did not work as expected. The wire insulation to one of the laser lights was pinched and damaged during factory assembly which prevented the laser light from working if pointed anywhere by the packaging position."
1,2 car laser parking system review,"Dont waste your money on this. It definately will not work for two cars. The lasers do not have a large enough pointing radius. Also, it is sporatic at best sensing movement in such a large area and turning on. Waste of money."
4,Easy parking!,"You can throw away your tennis balls ,this system is accurate and is easy to install.I would recommend it to anyone who has a garage parking issue."
1,Review for Dual Garage Laser,I would not recommend this product. One side quit working after one week and the whole thing quit after two weeks.
5,Excellent Price for Quality Speaker Wire,"This is an excellent price for this wire. Sure many people are happy using hardware store wire, but if you like the extra quality this wire has it. Works and looks great."
5,THE BEST EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Asome game,i love it,{go on the games web site newer verion there}This game flys with color's ,asome planes,you can even make your own plane its that easy,and im 12!ever wanted to put a huge roket on a rc helcopter with more than a thousend pounds of thrust?you can do it!,ever whantid to make your own plane?you can do it!ever whanted to sling shot a 747 of a aircract cairrar with 10 feet hie waves you can do it! This is the best Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,receives lots of compliments!,"This is a great casual/sporty watch that receives lots of compliments. One surprise was that I cannot wear it on my right wrist as I've always done as it is angled for only left wrist wearers. Also, I've had to relearn how to tell time without numbers."
3,"Great thoughts, poorly captured","After reading this book with high hopes and being disappointed, I thought maybe I had a trouble understanding it or that I was to critical. But after reading the other reviewers I believe I was right. At times the book has great observations like ""Most of the time a nation gets the leader they deserve"". Or the point that nations advance economically when they go to more bartering and hard assets to more abstract economics like stocks, interest rates, debt vehicles, etc. At times this book reads like the books Thomas Friedman's ""The world is flat"" or Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"" but those times are brief and rare. I am sure this author is a brilliant man, but unfortunately not a great writer. The author's ambition to write a book about victory at the personal, corporate, and national levels was a little to ambitious and led to the book traveling all over the place and never arriving at any real point.I would skip this one."
1,What is the deal with the Democratic presidents?,For him none of the US Democratic Prsidents were good... too bad i do not agree with that
4,Uneven. But still way above average,It is not as complete as Joshua Tree. It is somewhat uneven. But still it holds lots of power. Can't go wrong with this album.
5,Absolutely BRILLIANT re-make of a classic,"You'd be hard pressed to find anyone who has seen both the original and this 2008 re-make who doesn't find this re-make to be BETTER than the original. The acting is SUPERB throughout. Sean Combs gives a surprisingly believeable performance, while Phylicia Rashad SHINES in a role she was born to play. I now see why she was nominated for so many awards for this role. If you think you will think about Claire Huxtable, think again! She is AMAZING. This is a wonderful bittersweet story about money, greed, pride, and character that leaves you thinking about what is really important in life. Please understand, this is not a movie about black people, FOR black people. This is a movie for anyone with a beating heart. It was riveting from start to finish. You will laugh, cry, and be touched...it may even change you. I rented this from Blockbuster, and now I'm buying it."
4,Not as good as the original!,It was pretty good but P Diddy was not nearly as good as Sidney Poitier!
5,A Movie EVERY Member of the Family Should See!,"I was pleasantly surprised by the work by Puffy Combs in this movie. I remember seeing the play as a young man and it has not lost any of the positive impact that I learned from this story. Even though some of the scences were/are very negative and racially sterotypical, it has a positive story to tell even today to all races. Good movie for the whole family to watch and discuss afterwards."
5,"This is a fabulous, heartwarming and wonderful book!","My husband and I have reached the end of our infertility journey and are seriously considering adoption. This book has been a real inspiration to me! I am buying several copies to give as gifts to friends who have already adopted. You realize when you read the book that the parents are ""saved"" just as much as the children by the experience of adoption. I just loved this book!"
4,An innovative and heartwarming collection.,"A truly heartwarming book that will touch you, whether you have had an adoption experience or not. Even in the shortest stories, you can feel the love, and heartbreak sometimes, in all of the lives, in all of the families. You will not be surprised to find tears in your eyes after reading just the first few pages. If ever anyone needed an affirmation of the true meaning of adoption, this is it!"
3,Not bad Not Great,I liked the Hat but it can be misleading since it doesn't show the baseball adjustement in the back. It is like a baseball hat in that aspect and the bill is a lil plastic feeling. If your looking for a full up Wool/Leather Kepi you won't like this hat but if your looking for something with a baseball type hat feel to it and don't mind the bill not being authentic leather then this is for you.
2,More Jackie then Jane,"While I found this book diverting and fine for a bus read, the reviews comparing it favorably to Jane Austen are quite off track. Mary McCarthy writes a piece of sudsy melodrama--far more reminiscent of a Jaqueline Susaan novel than an elegant comedy of manners.It's a slightly elevated pot boiler, pure and simple. One step up from ""Peyton Place"" and ""The Best of Everything""---and that's largely because it revolves around Vassar grads and has a few $10 words tossed in."
4,Great,"This book really rips some of the old notions about women in the thirties. There's sex, breast feeding, post graduate education, you name it! Very witty, pithy, and sophisticated."
4,Book,"Although dated (1989), this book offers practical information for operating an infant and toddler program."
3,Weather Bear,"This wasn't exactly what I expected it to be, but my son liked putting it up on the wall with me. I'm not to sure how I will be able to use it again when winter comes next year, but we'll see. It is definately more appropriate for a classroom setting than in ones home for use."
4,Part needed,I had bought the T83Plus separately and needed this part. Good buy. Got it quickly and in the shape the seller promised.
1,Not As Advertised,I bought this item for a 9th grade student. Upon receipt I bought a cable and when I tried to plug it in learned the previous owner broke the cable plug off inside.Then we went to the TI webpage only to find out it was not supported by current software.Result: went to the local Best Buy and forked out $150 for the Titaniom model...the product I bought along with the $20 USB cable now make great paper weights. Very disappointing.
5,Works Great,"I bought this for my TI-83 Silver Edition and it works flawlessly. As an added bonus, it works perfectly with my TI-86 on Windows XP, even though it says on the package that it won't (package says this cable only supports the TI-86 on a Mac). I guess someone at Texas Instruments didn't try it."
4,TI USB,I have a TI-86 and Windows 7. I was trying transfer a Finance program on to my TI-86. It took a lot of playing around with it but I eventually got it to transfer the files for the Finance program. I had no luck with getting it to do anything else in Windows 7 but it did do the transfer so I am happy. So if you have Windows 7 and want to transfer something to a TI-86 your in luck if you want do something else it might not work. Hope this helps!
2,Software Update,"Cable is exactly as described, works as described.The included software (TI-Connect) is horrible. It supports Windows and OSX only (not a problem for most users). It only supports 64-bit operating systems in versions above 1.6.0 (2009). I could not get it to function properly on Windows 7 64-bit.Cable works fine, software not so much."
3,No vista? Guess i'll be upgrading,"This product does not work with windows Vista in any way shape or form. XP is fine and lower id assume, but a no go with Vista. Works phenomenal with windows XP. Software is easy to understand and use.My TI83 plus loves it"
3,Enjoyable But Not Memorable,"This is the forgotten U2 album and there is a reason why. It isn't as easily accessible or memory readible as their others. The only misstep in an amazing career, October will be seen as the non travesty it is only years to come. Were the people expecting too much? That's too hard to tell. But it isn't as bad as they would make it out to be.It's actaully quite enjoyable, Gloria, Fire, Scarlet, October, Tomorrow. All fine songs. It's at least worth a listen then make up your mind.Recommended."
4,Good album from early U2,"U2 / October: Apparently making up the lyrics in the studio (or so the legend says) it is not the lyrics that seem underdeveloped but the performances themselves. As good as the band sounds at times, they are still a band that overdoes the intros and exits. Still very enjoyable and well worth owning. This is an album with the band `on the verge' of success. Four Stars"
4,Drawn to the title from the web series,"I will need to delve deeper into the book, but if the web series is an indicator of the stinging satire it promises to be walk-of-shame-it-was-so-good. And, I have a little place in my heart for Peter with the Black Men's swimsuit pin-up model (although it should be taped to the side of the cabinet--just out of public viewing since ""no one ever comes to visit this side of the cube"")."
5,damn.. these guys got some skillz..,"I can't forget how I bought this CD... I was chillin at Tower records, just checking some stuff out when I heard the intro to this cd starting... Next came the track 'contagious', and I couldn't figure out who these guys were. I ran upto the counter and told them to sell me whatever CD that they were just playing... So, that's how I picked up this CD.. totally random, and I must say I'm lucky as hell.. if i wasn't at that store at that time, I prolly would've never known these guys..anyone who happens to run in to this review, do yourself a favor, and pick this CD up. Nice rhymes, beats, etc. etc. They have a flavor that is similiar to the Roots, but that might be because they have a live bassist. All in all, just ill as hell.. definitely wanna see them blow up!!"
3,"A ""stocking-stuffing moneymaker""?","If I were writing these remarks during Christmastime, I'd quip that this modestly likable, fairly thin, oddly ""horizontally oblong"" curio is a ""stocking stuffer."" It does manage to include a goodly assortment of tips likely to boost a beginner's (and perhaps occasionally a veteran's) performance.However, on the whole it strikes me as yet another calculated moneymaker for the presumably well-heeled Mizerak. (""Not that there's anything wrong with that!"") ;-)Bottom line, it's a rather cutely pleasing little paperback; however, whatever you do, don't pay the publisher's outrageously high full price. Indeed, don't pay a penny more than $4.00 (INCLUDING shipping)."
2,One to Grow On,I guess this will have to grow on you. It is very nice cd of choirs who are looking for appella songs. Entertaing but just dont hold my interest for too long.
2,garden spinner,"always know when the wind is blowing with this colorful garden spinner,can be stuck in the ground with the supplied spike or you can customize your own mount, either way its fun to enjoy."
5,Practice pad to go.,Simple. Amazing. Easy to use. just lay it down flatten it and drum. Best ten bucks a drummer can buy
3,good FLICK,"French cinema going American? I watched this film to pracitce my french listening skills, and I liked the dialogue. The story is kinda of like wedding crashers, insofar as these two guys are on the hunt for women, and find weddings a good setting. Thankfully still true to the french cinema there is not a cliche ending here. Here's some good acting, good script, and some good shots. Good for a nights distraction, but not going to move you. I would see Apres Vous"" instead."
3,Eh...,"There was some language in this movie and it was awkward as can be. This is not a movie for the whole family, it is not particularly entertaining, it was simply ok."
1,Child mutilation.,"I found the writing style wonderful, and the concept very well thought out. I did not however find the ongoing splatter and gore added anything special or extra to the story. I like Stephen King's books and they can be gorey, but this was a bit too far for me. The images of child mutilation just about made me yak and toss the book in the trash. If I hadn't wanted to finish the book for a book club meeting, I would have. Too grossly extensive violent imagry against children."
1,Go back to Charlie Parker...please,"What is a ""young adult"" anyway? Either you're an adult or you're not.Oh, well---I, like many other readers, love John Connolly. I think it must be inconvenient that there's another writer with the same last name who is also very popular. But Michael C. can't hold a candle to John C. Charlie Parker is a fascinating, troubled, flawed and deeply intelligent guy. I even started listening to Ryan Adams and Pinetop Seven because of these books.But, like another talented writer, China Mieville, who left his New Corbuzon novels for the insipid Un Lun Dun (even the title is stupid), John Connolly couldn't resist writing a ""young adult"" novel. I don't know if it's the Harry Potter in these writers, but they need to get a clue. I found The Book of Lost Things to be a rip-off of The Lion, the Witch and Wardrobe and Harry Potter. This book is derivative and silly. Who cares? I didn't even like the kid. What a whiner!!!11 More Charlie Parker, Mr. Connolly. Please"
4,Kept Me Up at Night!,"This book is so well written that for a time, my sense of reality and fantasy became blurred. After reading it, I spent about a couple of weeks making sure all lights were lit, fearful that the Crooked Man will come to get me. I couldn't sleep well at night, having the Crooked Man's silhouette in my mind's eye. The only thought that helped me sleep was (spoiler alert!!!!) David vanquished him and I am safe. All of these, from a 35-year old woman!Seriously, this book is creepy and enthralling at the same time. The is a certain morbidity to it that is just right for a horror genre. Some reviewers have commented that this is not for kids--- well, duh? Who told you it's childrens' literature in the first place?Connolly weaves words with such lyrical quality that even through the images in my mind are so graphic, I can't stop reading. It's a book to be read at daytime, especially if you are easily spooked as myself."
4,A very dark tale,"This incredibly dark and dreary tale of a young boy who loses his mother in the midst of World War I ravaged England is a must-read for fans of Pan's Labyrinth or the comic book Fables.It takes place mostly in a fantasy world populated by children's fears and fairy tales, but the tales have different endings than the ones we know. It is truly scary, truly strange, and well worth the read."
5,Grimmer than Grimm's,Brings something new to the traditional tale. He gives you the dark side of children's stories. Wonderful horrors.
5,"A scary fairy novel, not story","This is an amazing book. It's full of wondrous descriptions of weird critters, with a young boy who learns to act sensibly and who is full of heart. There are scary mythological beasts, such as half-men, half-wolves, which wear some clothing and walk on hind legs and are the leaders of the more primitive pack of wolves. All are hungry. There is hunger and disfigurement and famine in this world. There are creatures of which nightmares are made. This book frightened me so much I couldn't read it at night.And it's full of feelings about love and loss and striving and attainment and how to become a full human being. The denouement is exciting and the ending very sweet. And I loved the faithful horse!"
2,Stephen King wannabe,"I love fantasy books, remade fairy tales, and alternate universe stories. Many reviewers here comment on the fact that the alternate reality has been done before, and better, and I agree. I was most put off, though, by the similarities to Stephen King themes and characters, especially the Dark Tower series. Roland the knight, David (v.Jack) the boy, the dark tower, the wolves- all these seem copied from King, although not as entertaining or compelling. I gave up half-way through- I'd rather reread the Dark Tower (again). Also, the intro was way too long and tedious before the alternate world was entered."
2,Really Disappointed,"We bought the train and fire truck for our eighteen month old twins for Christmas. We were really excited about them having their first remote control toys. The toy looked awesome. They were durable, colorful,and easy to operate. We were happy until I remembered that the description stated that the toys were to make noise.They didn't make choo choo or siren sounds. The kids knew no better, but I was not happy with the quality of the toys. They ran a little rigid, but that could have been attributed to the fact that it was a train. They were BOTH huge disappointment. We have returned both toys."
2,Hmmm,"I like the Step Up series of movies. This was my least favorite one of them. The reason this movie did not get a one star was because the last half of the movie was actually really good. I'm not trolling, the actresses and actors were great dancers, but their acting was not very good at all. The first part of the movie was kinda bland, but the end definitely saved it. I loved the end of the movie. Some cool moves, and great story to end it."
5,step up,Step up revolution always has me on my toes best music :) def watch . My daughter & I loved it. We will def. Buy the DVD
2,It was just another dancing crew movie,"It was entertaining but nothing else. Same as the previous 3 parts, hot dancers, predictable ending, this time in South Miami Beach."
5,step up revolution,This was a great movie. I would sugest it to other people. Would rent again if going on a road trip
1,Wouldn't Play,This wouldn't play on computers or TV. Must be a different version. Very confusing trying to determine which format fits which device.
2,not worth the time.,fun dancing. terrible acting. oh well. we thought it'd be better with all the hype. best character was the mia michaels from so you think you can dance.
4,Plays good,"There have been no issues with the movie. I was shipped what I requested and within a good time :) The only thing that I wish I knew before I purchased is that it says ""rental only"" on the front of the movie. It's not a big issue, I just wish I would have known because it was a birthday gift. The movie looks and plays well though."
3,step up revolution,"This was given as a gift. The person liked it very much, and requested it as an option for a gift."
3,Same ol' same ol',"The dancing as always was amazing, but the plot was eh... The movie was entertaining though.For some reason the quality of this video was horrible, I realize this has to do with streaming issues and not the film itself, but this is the only film we have ever had problems with."
4,Dance scenes awesome,Dancing was awesome! The acting wasn't too bad. Storyline was ok. really enjoyed dance scenes. Choreography was very good. I enjoyed watching this movie although the love story is beginning to be redundant.
4,Great resource for A&P students!,"Going through the A&P certification courses. Had a bit of trouble with the required reading portion of the book relating to W&B. Bought this book as supplemental info, and it came in handy!"
2,Disaster!,"Sizzla used to be a truly special reggae artist. Forget this album and hear a lot of the tracks in their original form on his works prior to 2000 and on Da Real Thing. Unless you must have the cover photo in your collection, this is not worth the money. Why would he re-do classic tracks in an old cheesy-sounding unimaginative R&B approach in a time when there is increasing appreciation for reggae in its real form? Worse yet he sounds off key much of the time. I still cannot believe what he allowed these reggae novice-producers to do to Black Woman and Child."
1,Started getting errors after 1 month of use,"I purchased this lens and was initially very happy with it. However, within 30 days of light use I started to ge EE errors on my Nikon. So unfortunately I am not very happy with this purchase. I am looking at replacing it with a Nikon lense now."
4,Elvis DVD,"The item shipment took a little longer than expected, but I'm sure the timing with the Christmas holiday was the reason. The Package cover,( where the titles of the movies are) is torn off under the plastic wrap. Made us wonder if it had been opened and then re-wrapped. Since this was a gift, I was a little dissappointed that the wrapper was damaged like that. Truthfully, my husband has not opened this gift yet, but I am sure (hopeful) that everything is fine with the DVDs. Thank you"
3,Ok movie,"This movie is ok. It's campy and hokey. That's part of the appeal and enjoyment. It's not anything I would watch again in the next ten years though. I do like Max Von Sydow and Ed Harris, so that makes this worth watching at least once."
5,!!!,"Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah. Blah blah blah... Blah blah blah. I am a big fan of this show/movie."
4,"Hmmm, lets see, could it perhaps be....SATAN?","This is actually not that bad of a film, but if you've read the story I can see how one could be biased against it. Von Sydow plays the part of the shopkeeper/soulkeeper with barely contained glee. But notice, that is how the devil is said to work, through the people around ya. Did not it occur to the townsfolk that it is unusual for anyone to have vintage liquor in a truckstop, wroughtgut town? They never saw him coming..."
2,"Read the book, skip the movie.","The movie was quit different from the book, but with that aside the movie still wasn't that good. The movie had a certain childish quality towards it. I also found it a bit slow especially the first half. The way people acted and thought were sometime unrealistic. Although this movie was made in 1990 or so, maybe it might have been more popular back then. I was dissapointed in it. Unfotuantely a lot of King's movies are far different from the book and a lot of the good stuff is missed. The only one that goes against this that I know of so far is the Green Mile. But if you're bored one day you might as well rent it if you can't find anything else, it is entertaining to an extent."
2,far from faithful,"I love SK and most of his movie, but this was bad. The only faithfull scean is the fight with the two women with sharp butcher knives. Good cast, but the trasition from book to movie really needed more work. For some great SK adaptions see, Apt Pupil, Stand by Me, IT, MIsery, or just about anything other then this."
3,A nice adaption of a great book!,"This movie, based on the novel by Stephen King, has such a great premise. Its underlying tones focus on the greed and self-love we all have in ourselves, and how the devil can prey on our every weekness, with something as simple as a baseball card. It fails however, in chopping up the novel, and deleting many scenes that could have made this a very important movie. If you can, watch the 3 hour directors cut that aired on TBS, which has more charcters (including Cora Rusk) and in which the sellings of leland gaunt are spanned throughout the whole movie, instead of just in the first half. Great performances all around (JT walsh a bit over the top), while Amanda Plummer shines and chills as the victim Nettie Cobb, who participates in one of the best cat-fights I have ever seen!"
5,Needful Things DVD,"We had read the book, ""Needful Things"" for our book club. I had seen the movie many years ago and wanted to see it again to compare with the book. I could not find a DVD anywhere. I knew that I could get a copy from Amazon and I did. I enjoyed the movie very much and it gave a special 'life' to the characters. Max von Sydow does an excellent job of portraying the friendly/sinister Leland Gaunt. Also, Amanda Plummer and Valri Bromfield really do well in portraying the two warring women, Nettie Cobb and Wilma Jerzyck. Excellent movie."
5,Hidden Gem,I was at the Colts superbowl party and while the guys watched the game some of the women were looking thru a magazine. Inside they had a scratch and sniff of this perfume and my wife smelled it and loved it. I took a whiff and was pleasantly surprised myself. With Valentines day coming up I went online that following Monday and found it on Amazon. Best part is it's not an expensive perfume (compared to some I've bought for her) but in my opinion smells the best!
1,not the right place to buy.,"The perfume I received is just good to be trashed.This is not That ""forever"" by Alfred Sung"", described on the website.The stickers had been removed on bottle to hide the real name of this ugly perfume. If you want to buy the the right perfume , just buy from fragrancenet.com or amazon.Do not trust this seller."
2,Very weak on the economics for someone who wants to write on,Very weak on the economics for someone who wants to write on the subject. He may have made a lot of money but he does not say anything that has not been treated in the literature for the past 35 years. He shares with many others a poor understanding of what the notion of equilibrium is for or what it means. It is not a permanent quantitative solution to eternal simultaneous equations. In my view it is useful mainly for organizing thoughts and for answering comparative static questions...such as what happens to a stock price when George Soros plugs it...or what happens to prices when crops fail. The thought behind the book has litle to add we do not know from hog cycle models of the 50's. Financial markets are not the whole world.
4,An English Women of Lower Class Origins Who's Finally Made It,"I am surprised that there are no other reviews of this novel. Margaret Drabble is an English writer who has written several novels. I am a fan of Ms. Drabbles' work and enjoyed this novel very much.It is about an English woman who is somewhat 'hip', of lower class origins, who has finally made it. There is a lot of character analysis of her, along with her friends and lovers and their intermingling lives. The book is fun and very readable."
4,Dependable Power,"This Tripp Lite is a very good amp, 4 stars out of 5 possible. It provides nicely regulated 13.8 volts suitable for radio communications.It is a bit heavier than other makes of the same size (40 amperes), has no meter, and the lighted power switch on mine failed in less than two weeks. In addition, with only minor expence, T L could have used a transformer with multiple leads on the secondary side. Brought to a simple 3-way switch, this would allow a choice of 12. 13.8. and 15 volts. (Not every radio uses the usual 13.8.)That said, I have no regrets in having chosen this brand."
4,Good Movie! Great for cross-cultural missionaries!,"This is a great movie for a missionary going into a foreign country, especially one that is not used to foreign presence. But, it was a little on the short side."
5,Great Hat,Wife loved it ! Went great with her costume . Kids at schools really like complete her costume and had lots of fun with her .
1,Read once and discard,"Read the whole book in an hour, and found nothing of use to me. Worst book purchase I've made this year. Some of the tips border on absurd, others are simply incorrect."
5,comical AND useful,"from the people who brought you...um, that first book.it's the best type of time-wasting book you can buy!probably the best thing you can buy that under-parented, bored, weekend-time-wasting child in your life.if you hated this book, you might also hate: the book of bunny suicides and IT'S sequel,everything can be beaten,and, the perry bible fellowship.all available from Amazon.com :)"
5,Wonderful Film,"This film is remarkable and Cecilia Roth is amazing as always. Her character is so strong at times and then so weak. What I really like about the story, without giving away a main part, she how it seems she is writing the story. The final scene is magnificent and leaves you with a smile."
3,I have used one Star Logic 8D mouse,"I just got a Starlogic 8D mouse from Circuit City. The one I got is not the same modle as shown here. I have no difficult install or use it so far. I installed the driver on my windows XP and then plugged in the mouse, it works all right. I can scroll up or down, left or right, and the ball moves very very smoothly. I plugged in my original mouse and both mouses can work at the same time...The only concern I have over my 8D mouse is that the ball takes a little bit large place and therefore the right and left keys are smaller and it is not as comfortable as those old mouses to click on left or right keys."
5,We love this toy!!!!,"I bought this toy for my son who is 8 years old. I have to say that he really loves it. It's well built, durable and lots of fun. He had a friend over and they made a radio together; they were so excited. And the price was great too. I happen to see it at a local toy store and it was priced $30 more."
5,Snappy fun for youngsters,"My 5 year old adores this toy. After getting help for the first several hours (spread over a couple of days), he is able to follow the simple diagrams and run the experiments and projects. This toy has given him a safe way to explore his love for electronics and to learn its language and terminology. He even knows to wash his hands after play (as recommended in the instructions). I'm glad we chose SC-300 over the smaller sets, as there are many more parts. I highly recommend this toy for children with long attention spans who enjoy construction and science."
5,Great Fun!,"Lot's of fun. Just a little advanced for my six year old, but he really likes trying it and he's getting better. The best thing is that it keeps him interested."
5,I take this proudly to university.,"I am a liberal arts student, and I am taking an electricity class to satisfy a natural world credit. My professor assigned the Snap Circuit kit as ""required reading"". It is amazing! He gives us exercises with it in class, and we answer questions about how it works. Can simple worksheets make space sounds? I think not."
4,I Have not used it --it is a gift,This is a Christmas gift so we have not yet tested it nor even opened the box. It arrived on time.
5,Love Snap Circuits,My 9-year old grandson received them as a birthday gift. He asked for more for Christmas and can hardly wait to get them.
5,"Don't doubt, just order","I read reviews on this item and they were all outstanding. I decided to chance it and bought it for my nine year old son for Christmas. He loves it and worked several of the circuits, then he proceeded to create his own. I am a 4/5th grade teacher and teach electricity as a unit at school. This toy would be great to take to school and it is durable enough that I wouldn't worry about it. It is easy to put together and very stable. I would recommend it to anyone age 7 and up. Maybe the JR. one for younger. I am planning to add to this version so we, yes WE, can build more."
5,11 Yr old Son Loves it,He is moving through the projects at a steady pace and learning on the way. We plan to do the upgrade in the future.
5,"The Very Best ""Toy"" Ever!!!!","My 6 year old is fascinated with science. He has created his own lab out of various toys, and has some very basic test tube science kits. THIS is hands down his favorite science ""toy"" ever! He creates (on his own) even the most complex circuit experiments from the books. It gives him a great feeling of accomplishment and makes him feel like a real scientist. I cannot recommend this toy enough!!"
2,Disappointed,"Having read two other of Dr. Lerner's books on the Dance of Anger and the Dance of Connection, I was very disappointed in the lack of depth with this book. Probably little you could not find in an advice column from your local newspaper, except you could tab through for topics and carry it in your purse."
4,Very Creative and Organic Concepts in Drum & Bass,I was in the electronic section in the store when I ran across this cd and was attracted to it for no reason so I bought it blindly. Overall a great mix of dynamics that bleeds global genres with drum & bass to create a very richly textured cd. James Blood Ulmer is a-m-a-z-i-n-g as with most of the talent. I like the fact that these artists weren't afraid of things like Rock and blues mixing. Approach this cd with an open mind and I guarentee it will grow on you.
3,over charged for toy car.,"Toys r us, Target and Walmart sells these cars for $4 and these yeh-whos charge 4 time that much ($15) kind of a rip off if you ask me. These are the exact same cars you get form the other stores. But that being said I got the car in a timely manner and it was in great shape."
4,Great toy..but easily breakable!,"I bought this for my 2 year old son who loves our real washing machine. At first, I thought it was a nice toy. I really wasnt impressed with the size but the sounds were really life-like. Now a year later, it doesnt work anymore. The door broke off long ago and wouldnt stay on and now it doesnt even work at all. My son really enjoyed playing with it while it lasted but for a toddler it isnt very durable. My son liked carrying it around and for a 2 year old it is quite bulky so it would get dropped alot...wished they would have put a handle on the top. Overall, while it worked it was great..just wished it would have lasted longer than a year!"
3,Frenchman's Creek,"I am a fan of daphne Deu Maurier and love her books.I had read this book before but thought I would enjoy it the second time arround. This book was not quite at par with Rebecca which is one of her best books.The main character was very well developed but I was a bit disappointed with the development of the male characters in the book. On the whole,it was a good read."
3,Not the Style du Maurier is Best Known for,"I was first introduced to Daphne du Maurier's catalogue through the wonderful films 'Rebecca', 'Don't Look Now', and a British miniseries (sadly not available on DVD, but superior to the classic film version) of 'My Cousin Rachel'. This prompted me to snatch up all the du Maurier novels I could find. When I read 'Frenchman's Creek', I was rather disappointed that it is nothing like the taut, suspenseful psychological thrillers she is best known for. This swashbuckler is a decent historical romance, and if you like that type of novel, you will enjoy it. However, if you're looking for something more in the vein of Ruth Rendell, I would advise you to steer clear of this one and get the first three books I mentioned above as well as 'The House on the Strand', a later du Maurier novel in a similar style."
5,Intriguing Read,"A pretty quick read that's wonderfully written. Interesting characters brought an endless stream of emotions and a twisting storyline leaving you to question the ending and thoroughly enjoying the ride. One of my favorite books, definitely worth the time."
2,Dissappointing,"I could hardly put down both the ""Feast of Roses"" and ""Twentieth Wife"". This book however, I couldn't even finish. It was very dissapointing after the pleasure of her earlier works. I found it slow and ill-formed and the characters not especially compelling."
2,The lone dissenter?,"Perhaps I'm alone here, but I found this album poppy and hollow in comparison to The Golden Hour, which I find brilliant."
3,Aretha Deserves Better!,"I am not what you would call a ""huge"" Aretha fan, but I must say I love all of her big hits!Well when I found this collection and saw that all of her essentials were on here and also noticed that this was from Rhino, I went out and bought it. Well Rhino, for the first time, you have me really dissapointed.This CD's main problem is sound quality; now I'm not a professional on dropouts and mono and stereo and things like that, but I know when something does not sound right. Is it just me or does the instrumental section on ""The House That Jack Built"" really sound very distorted? And ""Chain of Fools"" has seen better days.An artist like Aretha deserves much better than this. I really must say from a great company like Rhino, I cannot believe they couldn't make a better collection.This is great music, but not a great collection."
3,"Love Aretha, Liked This Collection","This collection spans about 20 years of Aretha's career, and includes all of her biggest radio hits. If you want ""Respect"" and ""Chain of Fools,"" you've got it. If you want to trip back to the '80s to ""Who's Zoomin' Who"" and her quirky-yet-somehow-works duet ""Knew You Were Waiting"" with George Michael, then this collection is also for you. As a casual Aretha fan, I really enjoyed this collection. It may not be comprehensive, and may not show all of her most soulful tunes (especially not any lesser-known gems) or everything she can do with her massive vocal talent, but it does a capable job as a compilation.However, for those who are more serious Aretha Franklin devotees, this collection may be redundant. This is why I only gave it a 3-star rating. For everyone else who wants a little touch of Soul singing in their music collection, you really can't beat this compilation."
5,Core Max - Appropriate title!,"I purchased Core Max and like it so much I actually find myself eagerly looking forward to doing it. I see myself getting stronger and doing the more advanced moves each week that goes by. I love Cathe Friedrich workouts period, and will definitely use this one over and over. I like the chapters, and also the premixes."
3,Cathe Friedrich's CORE MAX,The three segments on the video are somewhat redundant. The overall price is way too high for what you get. Very disappointed in the content given the cost.
1,Poor quality,There were torn and twisted pages in it. I was very disapointed to see the poo quality of the cover and pages.
2,What a Disappointment ...,"Disc One had many of the songs I wanted, but the sound quality is definitely substandard, particularly in this day of digital remastering. I could have skipped Disc Two altogether - it consisted of a lot of screeching and poor arrangements of songs sung better by other groups. Based on some of the reviews I read, I really expected better for the money. Wish I could get a refund!"
2,Big Disappointment,"The sound quality on this compilation is absolutely horrible. The people at Rhino usually do an excellent job, so I suspect that the original masters must have been in pretty bad shape. Whatever the case, the first cd is barely listenable. The second of the 2cd set is much better than the first, but I was hoping to get a good clean cd of their early hits as well as the 70s stuff. It's a good compilation spanning their whole career, but if you have the old scratchy 45s of the early hits, I'm sure that they sound better than this cd."
1,No No No,"Research this man and his false teachings!He was convicted of violating the Mann Act by willfully transporting 16-year-old hitchhiker Emma Barelli across the Wisconsin state line ""for the purpose of debauchery and other immoral practices."" Dake pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months in a Milwaukee jail."
2,One Cable didn't work,I bought two cables and one of the cable ends wouldn't push in all the way in which made it unusable. Maybe i just got a bad cable but overall wasn't impressed by the quality of something that should be a given.
5,Video Monster Cables,"These monster cables are teh best around...I was using an older brand of cables and I switched to monster cables, I didnt think the cables would make such a big differnce... The sound quality is far superiour"
4,A good intellectual read,"I have been trying to finish this book for several months - I find that I can only read it when I am in a certain ""intellectual"" frame of mind. The parallels that are drawn between the experience of Vietnam Vets and Homer's Achilles are valid. As a Social Worker who works closely with Vietnam Vets in group and individual therapy, I can certainly appreciate the points that are made in this book, and I do believe that it increases my own understanding of my Vietnam Vets. However, I don't think I could recommend this book to my Vietnam Vets to read because the amount of concentration that this book requires is a luxury that many of them do not have as the result of their PTSD."
4,Their Most Focused Release,"A very steady recording indeed by Traffic. On this release, both Steve Windwood and David Mason contribute some excellent songs. Pearly Queen, Don't Be Sad, Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring, Feelin' Allright, Cryin' To Be Heard, and You Can Join In are all catchy focused numbers with some captivating solos which are not overly extended. In addition, the vocals stylings are very expressive in the case of both Windwood and Mason. They both bring out every possible tone in their voices.Overall, the effort is consistent if not quite spectacular as John Barleycorn or Low Spark Of Hi Heeled Boys. Vagabound Virgin does drag after a while and the last two songs(not including the extra tracks) are not as good as the others. None the less, the prime time material on this record makes it a worthy purchase."
5,Inspirational!,"Gloria Rodriguez is an inspiration to parents everywhere. If you're even THINKING about ordering this book, DO it. This is a book you will save and cherish."
1,Another one with missing parts,"Amazon should not carry items from manufacturers who have such poor quality control. I was excited when I took the parts from the box because nothing was damaged! Unfortunately, the left frame was missing. Can't put it together without that! So back it went."
3,so-so,This item arrived slightly damaged. Not worth the effort to send it back. Item was not too difficult to put together. Was on the small size but just what I needed for one set of clubs.
4,"Works well, worst directions of all time","The product is pretty good once I got it put together. You really need 2 people to put it together just to get the pieces to line up properly and for your sanity. The directions are terrible. It took me about an hour to put it together because at the beginning none of the pieces lined up. They don't tell you in the directions that you have to slightly bend the back frame to get the holes to line up properly. After I finally figured this out it wasn't that bad. Is it worth $70? I don't think so, maybe $50."
1,Impossible to put together,"As most people have already stated, the metal holes don't line up and there are gaps that prevent the back and sides from coming together with the base. I have tried assembling screws in different orders to avoid the gap, but no dice. The unit we received is not possible to put together by any mortal being and I am a veteran Ikea assembler from way back. The screws are barely long enough to fit together when there ISNT a gap, and some of the screws were defective and would slip out when tightening. Even with one person holding the frame together and another trying to make the screws reach, the base had a slight concave to it, which pushed the screws away from each other. Don't buy this defective and poorly designed product. You will regret it."
3,good functionality,"Typical of Amazon: arrived on time, and good price. Not a particularly well engineered product. It took a while to assemble. Not bad looking, and very functional. Some dents in the mesh siding, but not real bad. Shelves just wide enough to hold pair of golf shoes. Foam trim appears to be peel and stick and is already loose, but probably easily replaceable if desired. Everything considered: price, size, appearance, funtionality, I would recommend."
3,For hard core Civil War buffs only,"I'm a layman, and I started reading this to better educate myself about Gettysburg before taking a trip there. My take is the author wrote this for an audience who is already familiar with the battle. There is a tremendous amount of detail and minutiae that may be interesting to some people, but was far more than I wanted (or needed) to know. Moreover, the author's dry style did not make these details particularly compelling. Needless to say, I didn't finish it and, on the advice of a friend, read Michael Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"" instead. Good call! If you want an involving book that will enhance your visit to the battlefield and/or give you an understanding of what happened, read Shaara. I gave Sears' book three stars because I certainly respect the level of scholarship that's here, but I do not recommend it for anyone who is not a Civil War buff."
3,Pointless Retelling of Gettysburg,"I'm a Civil War buff so approached this book with great anticipation based on Stephen W. Sears' reputation.It is a very well written, thoroughly researched account of the battle, events leading up to it and immediately following, but adds little new to the subject. Much has been written about Gettysburg and one wonders if this one volume history was really necessary unless it brings new information. Unfortunately it doesn't.Still it is an interesting read of the battle, but for hard core civil war buffs only. I found the first part of the book too long and detailed about events leading up to the march north. Sears could have covered it in fewer words and chapters and reduced the size of this rather large 500+ page book.Despite this, it is still one of the better accounts of the Battle of Gettysburg."
3,Close but not close enough,"Personally, I have read 20 or so narratives about the Battle of Gettysburg. This work by Stephen Sears falls a bit short in my opinion but that isn't the authors fault. The Battle of Gettysburg has more one-volume histories than any other battle in existence. It is very difficult to create or add to such a large volume of work and make a big impact. Mr. Sears books are always top-notch and well researched so I do recommend this book to a reader that is new to the battle or new to the Civil War but if you are an esperienced reader than this book won't tell you anything that you haven't learned already. So I think that Sears did a great job and he could do no more than what has already been done."
4,"Britons, Picts, Scots, and English","Years ago, I picked up a used copy, but finally got around to reading it in 2011. It was nice to learn about the races of Britain: Britons, Picts, Scots, and English (Angles, Saxons, & Jutes).If you would like to feel knowledgeable about the origins of the language and the people who developed it, you ought to consider reading this early Saxon prose work (in addition to Beowulf...Saxon verse); don't let the ecclesiastical material bog you down and prevent you from finishing it."
4,wilder webb,This is incredibly energetic cow-punk or something like that. It still amazes me that he did not get completely famous with this stuff. Anaway songs like the human cannonballl really have lots of energy.
2,leaking like a sive,"upon receiving the cartridges, i opened the envelope and it was full of colored ink. when i opened the box all this ink had leaked out and onto my hands I am still getting ink off my hands. i had to go and buy one at the computer store, next time ill just do that."
3,printer cartridge,actually I don't see the point of reviewing a printer cartridge at all . It was a sealed packaged from the manufacturer and I would be surprised if there was a problem
5,Works as it should.,"What can you say about a replacement ink cartridge, especially if it's the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) brand and part number? The thing works. No bells or whistles, no fanfare for the common man; it just works. Don't try cheap imitations or refills in the HPs, folks; Big Brother and the cartridge monitoring program are watching! Unless you run the GEN-YOU-WINE HP cartridges in HP printers, you will get all sorts of funny on-screen messages, such as ""You need to realign your print heads again"" even though you have done it 3 times already; or the dread ""Incompatible Ink Cartridge""; then everything freezes up tighter than a screw on that 50-year-old rototiller you been workin' on. Yessir, you had better stick to the ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT cartridges with these printers!And what better place to buy at the right price, with great service, than AMAZON.COM? Huh? HUH?!?"
1,outdated ink,"Beware: The ink I received was 2-3/4 years old. The HP carton was the old light-blue design, and the inner bag was printed ""OCT09"" (I received it June 2012). I haven't installed the cartridge yet, so I don't know if it will work."
3,HP ink cartridge.,I unfortunately bought an HP printer which requires very expensive ink and a lot of it. Still it is great for pictures
2,driedup,This print cartridge shows full on my computer but prints very light like it is dried up--I am very disappointed.
5,Excellent Bargain,This particular ink cartridge usually sells for anywhere from $38-$42 dollars. So I was so thrilled to get this cartridge at the price that I did. It came in a hurry also.
2,Smoke juice,"I bought a Chauvet fogger with their juice for parties, but learned that these type foggers make more of a ""smoke effect"" than real fog that hugs the ground. I was dissapointed as I didnt want to have the kids breathing in all this ""juice"". Would have preferred it to hug ground and not be in everyones face. If you want a real fog like effect... you must find dry ice. It works much better but cost more."
5,Works great!,"I went with Chauvet fog because I have a Chauvet 1100 machine. Fog came out nicely, very thick. No issues."
5,A Worthwhile Sequel,"This is the follow-up to the authors' watershed first edition of the book by the same name, and contrary to the fate of most sequels, this one's really worthwhile. Indeed, it's largely a new book, rather than a mere revision; it fully updates the reader on the journey and developments in ""transformative mediation"" over the decade since the authors' first book with the same title was published in 1995. For anyone with an interest in the transformative model of mediation (as contrasted with, for example, facilitative or evaluative mediation), this is the best, most comprehensive, and well-written volume available."
1,Pluck out your eyes,"I don't know what movie the other reviewer watched, but this has got to be one of the worst movies ever. Does the fact that they dumped the picture into only ten markets in the south to see if it even had an audience tell you how proud the studio was of this picture? If you'd like to see how bad a film can be, this is a masterpiece."
5,Mirror Mirror,Interesting...snipets of life..all twisted into modern day fairy tales. This is for all readers alive in this day and age.
2,nothing new,"the stories have the usual sex, disillusionment, family angst, and attitude that are in hundreds of stories written by college students in creative writing classes who think they have come up with something new - can we get beyond this - it may be titillating and at times interesting, but it is not good literature"
5,One of the best,"I would rank this film up there with all the great ""Black Love"" films. It is right up there with Mahagony, Love Jones, and Love and Basketball. It is a shame it wasn't released in the theaters. I think we need more thoughtful, intelligent films like this one and a little less Soul Plane. . . If you like a little soul in your romantic comedy then pick this film up today!"
3,It was OK,"This movie was OK. It was kind of corny to me, but it kept my attention. It reminded me of a lifetime movie."
4,Great story.,"I ordered this movie just to qualify for free shipping. It quickly became my favorite to show to while having friends over for Sunday dinner. I didn't expect much of it because I had never seen it advertised, but it truly is worth what I paid plus the free shipping.And it is even clean enough to be a teenage favorite at my house too."
3,Useful (especially if you have a sweet tooth),"There are a lot of interesting ideas in this book for a quick but novel meal. I've tried some and plan to try many more. Be warned, however, that a fairly large number of the main recipes are pretty sweet, using products like chutney for flavoring. I could have done with fewer of these, but that's what makes horse races."
1,BUREAUCRATIC READING,"This book seemed to me nothing more than a scrap collection of combat reports thrown together. The author gives no indication about what happened behind the 56's curtains. He tells no intersting tales which got into the unit's folclore. It is coldly written, and doesn't even bothered to check the enemy side. Bad job!"
1,Disappointed,I've been a TZ fan since I was a kid. I use to fake sick just so I could watch it at noon on channel 5. I bought this disc because after all the times I faked sick and all the TZ marathons I had not seen one of them. And now I know why. Where is Everybody started out good but the ending is lame. The Encounter was very boring. An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge was the best episode but it read much better.
2,waste of money,"You will be able to recognize several French words, but you'll never learn how to read and write. It is very easy to use, you have to click pictures to answer simple questions, but for serious learner it is waste of money. Even if you do not want to read or write, but only understand spoken French, it has very limited vocabulary and will not help you. I am not sure if any software will teach you grammar, but for studying it I would suggest buying books."
4,Amazing,"A friend passed this CD along to me and just said, ""have a listen."" After one night with the record, I was on the website trying to find their shows. To get an idea of the sound, it is part-The Rapture, part-Afrika Bambaata, but the end result is refreshingly unique. If you are a fan of the DFA label, or if you dig The Gang of Four - or hell, if you're into indie rock and alternative dance, you will find yourself inspired by this sometimes dark, but driving, exciting music."
4,A Second Good Read,"The second Nina Reilly novel is another very good read. Nina is believably fallible, but interesting and lovable. This is, of course, in the light reading category, not quite as good as Tony Hillerman or Judith A. Jance, but still a page turner.watziznaym@gmail.com"
5,Masterpiece,"David Lean directed this 1946 love story. It is the epitome of love stories with train stations on the background: e.g. Casablanca. The Criterion transfer is impecable.If you just look at the photo on the dvd cover you will know all you need about the story.The film is made with clockwork precision and tactfulness. I had seen this movie only one time when a kid and couldn't wait to get my hands on this edition. There's something about trains that captivates...Now I can't decide if I perfer -of Lean's best works- ""Ryan's daughter"" or ""Brief Encounter""."
4,Single slice...,"This is a fun CD that has a more rocking style then their first CD. The band puts together great lyrics and harmonies with a style that you will find yourself singing along to. Plus, they are great in concert as well!"
5,Great Foundation tool for those new to the pilates principle,"This is a wonderful introduction to those new to pilates. Hilary elegantly demonstrates 10 basic exercises that are simple but effective. They serve as the foundation to the pilates principles. These basic moves are particularly useful in developing a daily practice. This tape would serve as a great daily practice for intermediates as well. The setting is beautiful and enhances the mood for an effective practice. This matwork session will tone, strengthen and enhance flexibility. I highly recommend this tape, especially for beginners. Then as you progress in your practice, her Pilates Intermediate video would be the perfect enhancement. You can't go wrong with her new series! (...)"
5,Love this video!,"I am very new to Pilates, in fact, this is the first Pilates video I've ever owned. I bought this particular one because of the high reviews and I have to say that the reviews and ratings are right on target. I love this video! Pilates is very challenging but also very rewarding. I am a mother of two small children and I also work. This video fits wonderfully into my schedule. Who can't squeeze in 24 minutes while the kids are asleep? I even look forward to my next workout! I plan on buying the intermediate video once I master this one. By the way, I too love the scenery that's in this video and Hilary is a great instructor. She's very calming, yet motivating. Buy this video, you won't be sorry!"
5,use this everyday!!,"the workout is only about 20-25 minutes and is time WELL spent. Hilary provides excellent cues and descriptions that make it clear how to perform the exercises. After 4 weeks, I'm off to purchase the intermediate tape...but the basic tape is an absolute prerequisite that will now be inherited by my sister-in-law!"
4,Great source for adventure hooks and setting detail,"A must-have if you want to run games in the setting used in the Exalted books. Though the Core book gives some basic setting information, Scavenger Sons actually gives you enough detail to provide starting points for adventures and campaigns, as well as interesting backstories for characters, for any area of the world (not just the Scavenger Lands, as the name implies). If you play like I do, having more setting detail is extremely helpful. Overall, the book is well-written, though be warned that there isn't a whole lot in the way of new rules - if you buy books only for the crunch and could care less about setting detail, you might want to save the money for a new fatsplat instead. However, keep in mind that when the new edition comes out, this book won't become obsolete like many of the others might."
5,all you ever need to know about health and life,"It is a very instructive, concise, easy to understand and apply to real life book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who strives to live a simple and healthy life."
2,Defective Item,"Hey ya'll. I just purchased a Chi from this seller. The item was supposed to be brand new, but it seemed like it was refurbished. The product did turn on, but it didn't heat like I know this model can. also the red light kept flashing. Another thing I disliked was that the item location was supposed to be New Jersey, however, after waiting about a month for our package we received it with China marked in the return address. I just wanted to bring this to your attention before you spend hundred dollars on a disappointing item.Kent"
