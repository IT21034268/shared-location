5,Works great,Loctite blu threadlocker is recommended for gunsmithing. I used it when changing the front sight on a pistol. The sight has been on for quite a while now with no issues. The blu is recommended so it will be easier to disengage if and when you want to change the sights.The product arrived on time and well packaged.
5,Great Quality; great Price,"These tools are well designed and sturdy, not the flimsy like so many others."
5,Best for the Wild Mage!,"The Immortals Quartet is one of my favorite series of books. I'd personally have to say, this is my favorite of the four of 'em. There is a lot of everything that should be expected of a Tamora Pierce book. Daine goes along with the Royal Commitee that is supposed to negotiate peace with Tortall's neighbor Carthak because the Emporer's birds are ill. There's the humor, outrage, happiness, etc. that's necessary for a good book. Emporer Mage is a great great great book!"
5,Awesome!!,This book is Tamora at her very best. It will keep you reading until your done. This may be the best book I ever read!!
5,"An inspirational, insightful autobiography","China's Sons is the intensely personal account of Da Chen, born in China in 1962, is reviewed here for its importance to many an adult reader as well. Chen and his family were outcasts in Communist China, and Da had to drop out of school as a result. When Mao died, Da faced a long struggle to regain his education and go to college &#65533; and his entire family helped him succeed. China's Son is an inspirational, insightful autobiography."
5,WOW!,This book is beautifully written and opened up the real history of the cultural revolution to me.
4,"Informative, sad, and inspirational","As a teacher working in China, I was really interested in this book just from the synopsis. This book really gives the reader a sense of what China was like during the Cultural Revolution. I found myself reading with my mouth open because of the shocking things that happened during that time. I like this book because it is an autobiography- so nothing is fake. I teach students who are so privileged and they hate school- this boy loves school. I love the differences between then and now.. you gotta read this book!"
2,Doesn't Work for Long,"I bought this and the hands-free shower unit directly from Sharper Image. Within 2 months, neither one worked. I tried new batteries, different soap, then tried the special electronics batteries. Every once in a while, it would just turn on when noone was even close to it, but if you wanted to actually use it, no way. Sad."
4,Excellent net for a 3 and 4 year olds,"This net is just the right length for 3 and 4 year olds. The net part itself is also a good size; deep enough to catch a butterfly but not so deep that it falls ""closed"" while the child is swinging it thru the air in order to catch the butterfly. Only complaint is that the net is very thin and can easily tear if caught on a bush. Otherwise, an excellent learning ""toy"""
2,Spotty Follow-Up,"Where the previous volume of this series felt like a great introduction, this book feels leaden. Half the time, the author feels like he's still setting up the setting, but nearly every character or setting he introduces is destroyed right away. In the end, only Jessica Sorrow remains of the new characters introduced to return in the future.Author Simon R. Green hopscotches from one encounter to another--a psychic boy band, a dancer who lives by stealing vitality from the undead, a gun that works by undoing God's creation--only to have the lead prove fruitless and the characters in question be destroyed. This feels less like a mission or a quest than a scavanger hunt at a spastic child's birthday party.Green has a wonderful setting in the Nightside, and compelling, sympathetic characters in John Taylor and Suzie Shooter. Here's hoping that, in future installments, he rambles less and narrates more."
5,Darling little doll,Perfect first doll. Just the right size. This is my second Corolle doll. My 2 year old granddaughter loves this doll.
3,A little disappointing :(,"I spent my own money on this for something to play with during summer vacation.Disappointing. First of all it came late. Second, I was sooooooooo annoyed to see that it has these 2, icky little teeth on the top of its mouth.i am trying to find a way to get rid of them. Also, it arrived smelling like play-doh!! I am going to have to wash it or something."
2,Disappointed that the chair was not included,What is the point of having a sitting doll without the chair. I did not see a chair I could order so I assume it was included. Nothing in the ad about the chair not being included. Misleading advertizing (I think)it is a crime. Shame on you Amazon.
5,Great doll.,I bought this for my daughter when she was 14 months old. It's the perfect size for her to hold and she loves the doll's closing eyes. The doll also has a nice baby scent that others don't have.
1,"One Star For The MP3 Quality, Five Stars For The Music","I just downloaded this much-beloved soundtrack, but I'm listening to a shriek of high-hat puke. This is very disrespectful to Mr. Hayes and his awesome music! Off to go request a refund..."
2,Lacking Substance,"I bought this because it had a five star rating here on Amazon (at the time, anyway), but I wish I had paid closer attention to who the author was as I had just finished another Barbara Rose book that I was equally disappointed in. Her heart is in the right place... which is the only reason I give it two stars instead of one. The content lacks substance. It's filled with broad and simplistic phrases that did little to inspire me."
1,Very Poor Customer Service,"We purchased this combo TV and approximately 60 days later, the VCR slot began malfunctioning. We tried to call the customer service number, and was on-hold for 45 minutes (15 customers in queue waiting) before a service representative answered. She took some basic information and then put me on hold for another 20 minutes before disconnecting me with no repair/return information. I called again and there was 19 customers in queue. This is a great price for these features, but you may want to consider the lack of customer service when making your decison to buy."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst purchase I have ever made. After a few months the connections on the back stopped working and I had to attach different wires to the cable- that lasted about a month, and now the cable goes out all the time. Then tonight the picture started to distort- I've barely had the tv two years.Do NOT buy this."
3,informative but outdated,i was disappointed as much information was two-three years old.i should have checked the date of edition more carefully before purchase. i have gotten a lot of useful information and the book has been helpful but i am staying at a hotel in bangkok that has changed names and eating at a place in chiang dao that has changed ownership. i have used the internet to update information before making decisions.
4,Just short...,"When I travel, I swear by Lonely Planet, so I'm used to a certain standard of content and clarity. Although I only used about a quarter of this book's total content on my last journey, there were certain instances where more information would have been certainly preferred; and had me and my partner not been as savvy as we were, whole days could've been compromised. However this guide was still extremely helpful, overall."
1,you have to force yourself to read,"i love to read and this is the first of the magic series i have read. its starts offr good but it goes down hill in a hurry. there seems to be no plot in this story. i would of rather started with the second book chainers tourment, it starts by giving you some info before this book starts and goes till after this book ends and gives you all the info you need from the first book. you will not miss anything if you skip this book. i wish i didnt buy this book."
4,There should be a rating : NO STARS,JUNK !!!Cheap breakable glassTemperature off by 20 %Humidity off 5-10 %Unless it's free I would look somewhere elseOther than that it's okay
5,respect,"i just think that this book should be one that everyone reads at some point in their lives (sooner rather than later!). it really gives you something special, something i have very rarely experienced in a book. open the book and open your mind!"
5,Great fit and full coverage,"I bought this for my daughter who dances in every class the studio offers. This leotard is full coverage for the more active classes such as acrobatics/tumbling. The full coverage maintains her modesty and allows her to wear a bra without the straps showing. Great quality, full coverage, and easy care instructions make this a value. Very pleased."
5,New Favorite,"Most of my ""stats"" fell into the medium size, except for my hip size which fell in the large, so I bought a large, perhaps that's why people have had trouble and said to order a size up? Or maybe they are just used to a looser fit. With that said I love this leotard. I haven't danced in it yet but just in trying it on I can tell I'll like it. The straps are thick so if I needed to wear a bra it would hide it which I appreciate. The back is high enough that I don't feel like I need to wear a sweater - I have bought leotards with ""keyhole"" or whatever you call it openings but often I feel as though those make my back look gross and thus wear a sweater. It's a nice material and worth the price, I'm pretty certain this will be my new favorite leotard."
4,good quality basic leotard,"good quality basic leotard; sizing is correct, good stretch. Nice quality garment. Women's size small, 5-7 junior fits the Small size."
4,capezio women tank leotard,fits great and the price was ok i dont always buy clothes online because i never get the right fit but this time i got the capezio leotard
2,Not easy to use,"It looks like I'm the first to give these a low rating. Here are my reasons:1. The numbers are very small, so difficult to read. At night, even with a flashlight, it's just worse.2. I installed four on my travel trailer compartment doors. Two are now very difficult to roll the numbers, one of which I can only ""fake"" scrambling them by rolling half a click. They won't go past that point.On the plus side, I like not having to carry keys for these compartments."
2,Lacking in sizing for straps,"The official description of the Small Outward Hound Pack says that its for ""dogs weighing up to 18 lbs"". This is unrealistic. I bought this for my dog who is 7 lbs and the size of the pack is okay, but the straps are ridiculously long and even went sized to the smallest, could not fit the girth. I tried this pack on my dog and a friends and I would say the minimum girth to fit this pack would be about 15"". Even if you fit it then, you'll have about 6"" of extra length of straps which your dog will trip over.Besides the strap sizing, the actual pack is pretty well constructed. I have no complaints on the pack and so if you're good with a needle and thread, you can hem the straps to properly fit your dog."
3,It's cute and fun but not very well made at all.,"If you want a ""fake"" accordion, go for it. if you're someone who's a astickler for quality, skip it.the item arrived scuffed and scratched as if it were tossed around an autoshop for 20 minutes before being packaged. Not only that one of the keys appears makes only a wind/air sound so that's obviously broken. The only saving grace is that it still packs a nice accordion sound with the few keys that do work, and my daughter was pretty happy with it, so it got the job done. Overall though, kind of sad that a company would take so little pride in the quality of what they are selling but what can you expect at this price point."
3,Smaller than expected,"I didn't notice the size when I ordered this - it's pretty small. The bellows are kind of stiff but the sound is pretty good. It's not like a piano accordion where you can play a scale on the keys and it doesn't matter whether you're pulling or pushing the bellows - as stated in the description, it produces one note when you pull and another when you push. For that reason, I think it's a bit too complicated for my 4-year-old granddaughter...so I'm returning it."
3,It's Kind of Silly,One of these days I'll have to write a real book for kids with mood disorders. This book is silly.
4,Even a nobody can do what is right,I bought this book for my daughter's 8th birthday. I appreciate the valuable lesson it teaches that it is never too late to do the right thing.
4,Sea of Troubles is a changing style for Leon,"This book shows a slightly different style of her writing. Guido seems a little more detached. He is starting to sound like a ""man"" instead of just the Commissario he usually sounds like in her books. This is my 15th book of hers that I have read and enjoy every single one of them. I love Venice and thoroughly enjoy reading about it through Brunetti's eyes through Leon's writings. A fun read as are all her books."
1,We found the book unbalanced on the whole.,"We bought this book hoping that it would provide our family with helpful information for this difficult decision. The authors certainly know how to put on the ""hard sell"" but this put us on our guard. Almost nothing in this book is of real medical value. The authors say that they are doctors, but they come across like used car salesmen. The obvious bias of the authors, the failure to present the other side of the issue in a responsible manner, and the use of obvious scare tactics left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Anyone seeking objective information and balance would be advised to look elsewhere. The book earns one star only because it serves as a model of high pressure sales tactics."
1,Too small,"I wasn't too happy with this cosmetic bag. It was a little cheapy bag. Because it's white, it got dirty too fast and fell apart very quickly."
4,Nice,"Nice squeegee. If I were to do it all over again, I would be sure to purchase the squeegee and applicator seperately as cleaning in corners or tight areas is next to impossible. Again it works great, but for our NEO ANGLE shower, not the best purchase but it was my fault."
2,misleading,"I bought this item under the premise that it came with the pole as well... I was wrong. The image was misleading and made it look as if the product was whole. That was very disappointing, so now I have to get a pole for it. In the end I was not happy. They should fix the image when selling this product so this doesn't happen to more people. Be more specific!"
5,"looking back, looking ahead","I have been a fan of the Yellowjackets since I first heard them 25 years ago. I've always enjoyed their playing, their arrangements, and been very influenced by Russell Ferrante's writing and playing. So I looked forward to this CD/DVD package with great expectations and I wasnt disappointed. Even though there are no new titles on the cd/dvd, there is plenty of new music, as they take many of their older songs and give them completely new and fresh approaches. Yes it is a retrospective on one hand, but they continue to explore new territory with their older music because of the high level of musicianship they each possess. One thing that stood out on the DVD portion was how relaxed they appear playing, and yet how intense and how deep they get with the music. It seems truly that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, and it's a pleasure to see that achieved throughout the course of this set. Highly recommended."
5,Tarzan with Johnny Weissmuller,I was so excited when I finally ordered some Tarzan. I couldn't wait for it to get here. I remembered all the episodes from when I was a kid. Watching it on Saturday mornings. Johnny Weissmuller was my favorite. Oh and Cheetah the Chimpanzee.My order was shipped right away and both dvd sets that I ordered were sent together.There are many more Tarzan sets to get and I can't wait. I will be ordering Volume 2 as soon as possible. Thanks.The Tarzan Collection Starring Johnny Weissmuller (Tarzan the Ape Man / Escapes / and His Mate / Finds a Son / Secret Treasure / New York Adventure)
5,Tarzan collection is excellent,The Tarzan collection that I purchased is what I expected it to be. The picture quality is great and I enjoyed looking back at the old movies. It's funny looking at the makeup and hairpieces worn by the actors back then.
1,Not the product pictured....,Very nervous to use product as it came in a plain bottle with a self made lable. This is not the product pictured at all and looks like some sort of homemade thing. I'm disapointed I will most likely have to repurchase the listed item elsewhere to be sure it's the actual product shown.
1,ugh1 Terrible quality,The book was so yellow and old i thought it was contemporary to Mr. Jefferson.new means just that not kept dusty and old ion a shelf and sold asa new . also @3.99 to ship .A paperback ?
2,I could have done a better photocopy job,I think this was made with a dito machine from the 70's. Really hard to do some of the problems when they were originally in color.
3,"So-so sound, great idea with problems","What could be better than hanging your first generation ipod nano around your neck?Well, First off, I must say that these headphones lasted about 3 months before they were totally unusable. The plastic coating on the wire coming from the neck cord to the earbuds hardened so much that it actually started to snap in places before the left side was just hanging together by the exposed audio wires. This is an unforgivable flaw in this product.Sound quality was passable if you didn't care about what your music sounded like. I must say that they did feel comfortable in my ears. Of course, when the wire started to harden they were difficult to keep in the ear.I really like the design. Much better than Apple's lanyard headphones, in my opinion. The cord around the neck is comfortable as it's cloth covered. You barely know it's around your neck. The other flaws detract from what could have been a stellar product."
4,Good routine,This is an enjoyable DVD which is important quality for an exercise DVD. I removed 1 star because I would prefer more repetitions for each exercise demonstrated here.
5,Golf Swing,You can't find a better book explaining all the nuances of a golf swing. It certainly exceeded my expectation. I am happy to have made this investment in improving my golf.
2,It's a toughie.,"This is the text book that was assigned to my class, and I am taking an at-home course. I don't know if these guys are covering everything or not, but I can tell you this: they sure don't know how to write clearly. Sentences are long-winded and convoluted. I read each sentence over and over just trying to figure it out. I am taking notes by re-writing every paragraph. Appraisal school is difficult enough without having to decipher and translate the textbook into plain English. Today's example:""The amount of the expected annual 'effective gross income' from the property, estimated by subtracting aniticipated vacancy and collection losses from potential gross income"".I translated that to:""Effective Gross income equals potential gross income minus (anticipated vacancy + collection losses).""It makes for very tedious studying."
2,"about 18"" too short","I bought this to go with the Oasis Jr. mailbox, but after it arrived we learned this post is about 18"" too short for our local postal regulations. The height requirements (ground to top of door) is taller than what's described on the post's description and packaging, so it was way too short given how deep we needed to put the post. Maybe folks who don't have to worry about getting below the frost line -- or can pour a bunch of concrete -- won't have that problem. We live in the city and our box is across the street on our neighbor's property, so we didn't think we should pour concrete. Wound up using a cedar post from Lowe's and returning this one. I wouldn't have minded if there was a longer post we could have exchanged this one for, but their one-size-fits-most approach didn't work out."
4,Excellent in content and brevity!,"Excellent recap of Lincoln and the Civil War! Mr. Gienapp provides a brief ""just enough"" bio of Abe Lincoln's early years through adult life and political pursuits to president. He provides insight into the 16th president's jovial personality and home life challenges that explains to some extent his melancholy demeanor. In spite of the latter, he proved to be a diamond in the rough and a master of the game. Well written historical account."
5,Very sharp and deadly,"I cannot comment for sure on the deadly part but this is the knife I would choose if I had to be in a knife fight. Out of the box, it's wicked sharp and fits perfectly in your hand. The clip is snug and adjustable for both right handed and left handed users. When clipped to your belt or pants, the sheath stays put. For self defense, this is a must have."
1,Is Incompatible with iPad/iPhone etc.,Unit does NOT connect to any of the mapping software. A waste of money. Description should indicate that the unit is no use for iPad/iPhone.
1,Still can't try it...,"I purchased it hoping to sync it with my tablet for an upcoming trip. So excited.The item showed up in a plastic zip-lock baggie with no cord, no instructions, nothing else. That was a little downer. I thought I was buying a new item. So of course the battery on it is not charged, but since there is no included power cord, it's useless.It takes a special type of 5v cord which nothing else that I own takes, so I don't have one. I ordered a USB charger cord on Amazon that was supposed to work. The listing said it is compatible with this device, but of course it didn't fit. And radio shack doesn't sell them.So now I'm sitting here with a cute little device that is being used as a paperweight because I have no way to charge the unit.But hey, it may work fine. Who knows?"
1,Unlikable characters,"This book was horrible. The characters weren't very intelligent or likable. Elf (what a name!) is just a nimrod who thinks she's smart. And Fort (I kind of do like his name) is laughable as a hero or a seducer. He actually gave a speech to her about how he would handle any unexpected pregnancies while trying to get her into bed. So wierd.Bad writing, bad characters."
2,"BOOK IS WICKED, BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY","I read a LOT of romance novels and always look foward to reading a new (to me at anyrate) author. This book looked good so I gave it a try. It had a promising start but went down hill from there. I rather liked the hero, who seemed to be a nice guy. However, nothing in the book made sense. Why did the earl and the duchess not like each other? I'm still not sure. Why was the heroine worried about scandalizing the earl with the statue? The statue was pretty tame compared to their reason for marrying. Why would the earl be interested in his twit of a wife? I would have had her strangled and buried quietly. Oh well. Maybe it was not a good day for Jo Beverly. If I do read another of her books (doubtful), I hope that it has a plot and characters that make sense."
3,Not very good quality,This item wasn't very good quality. It broke after only a week and a half! Our puppy only weighs 17 pounds so I see no reason why it should have broken so quickly.
5,Well Crafted Story - A Great Adventure,"This is a wonderful adventure story which is hard to put down! Within Robert?s quest to finish his beloved Grandfather?s work, every reader will find something which strikes a chord from his/her own life. Both Native American and Scottish lore are incorporated into the ?magic? or ?fantasy? elements, which are so well constructed that the reader never doubts that everything which occurs is quite real. The scenes are artfully crafted and the words carefully chosen ? a real delight. A great read for both teens and adults."
3,"good movie, not perfect","Private ryan was a decent war flick, but was it the best? I wouldn't go that far. It was bloody and all, but it didn't have very good writing. Tom hanks is also overrated in this movie. This film doesn't compare to movies like ""das boot"", ""the thin red line"", or ""cross of iron"". The reviewer down below should take a chill pill, you don't prove your case by using tons of exclamation points and by calling people names. We all have opinions, and they should be respected."
4,"good, but...","Hugh is obviously ambitious and willing to share what it takes to achieve influence without compromise. However, I hope he has no kids or their life would be one without him I'm afraid. It's a book for type A personalities. The advice was excellent though the tone made me bristle at times. It might have been better if before writing ""In But Not Of"" he had swallowed a dose of ""Proud But Not Arrogant""Still, because it is rich with good advice, it will be given to graduates on my gift list this spring."
1,do not buy this,"Usually I have little or no tower signal. I have many dropped calls and have NEVER had a clear call. It is fuzzy, and many times I can't hear the person on the other end or they can't hear me. I like the phone itself. But I have to say that the reception is more important, otherwise the phone is worthless. Cingular (like a person in another review mentioned) is not willing to upgrade the phone without a 2 year contract and I would have to pay for the upgraded phone. No Thanks. The 1 star is only because I liked the basic features of the phone."
3,Headset problems,"Phone is small and cute and I love the color display...however, there's a loud buzzing noise when you try to use any headset with it. Does anyone else have this problem?"
4,True Hendrix fans will be delighted!,"Short but sweet. Nobody outdoes Jimi when it comes to guitar work. If you're a Hendrix fan, don't hesistate; add this single to your collection."
2,Not the drive you may think,Just got this..when ordered I thought the standard apex would fit it. Not so this is a square drive...I am returning it.. Otherwise the build feels real good. But not really built for turning more of a pulling type handle.
2,Not too useful,"The CSET study guide was not very useful. It lacked detail and neccessary information for EACH subtest was omitted. The information seemed old and sometimes was incorrect. For example how many questions were in each section, the format for each section and even the study guide didn't at all reflect the actual CSET itself. It gave tips on teaching more so than help you prepare for the test. This was suppposed to be a STUDY GUIDE and it felt short in its qualifications. The CSET is a complex exam and this guide was broad and generally did not properly inform, direct or assist."
1,I spent money on...?,"If the goal of this text was to hone my editing skills and to make sure that, as a future English teacher, I can identify grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors then the publishers have succeeded. I had more luck with the preparatory materials offered on the CSET website even if it was painful to print over fifty pages after paying $35 for this test prep book. This book is dreadful and has not helped me in the least to feel more confident in my ability to take this test."
2,Horrible editing,"As one of the other reviewers noted, the editing in this book is horrible. Nearly every other page has major grammar and/or spelling errors that are very distracting to the story. For me, it was almost impossible to get into the story due to these errors, and they just made other inconsistancies stick out more. I'm sure the story line is solid, but it was rather hard for me to tell with all the errors."
3,Durable but basic,"I purchased this for my 3 year old son who loves all kinds of machines and trucks, especially of the caterpillar brand. It was my fault that I mistakenly thought it had a remote, since that was what I searched for. However i guess i did not read the description well as i searched for christmas gifts in the middle of the night online. Lol. The truck is well made and sturdy, though it's made of hard plastic and not metal. While he likes the toy, he quickly loses interest. I think it may be more of a hit when we can take it into the sandbox in the summer months to do some real digging. The toy is not a bad toy and it's descent quality, but for what I paid for it, I would have wanted a remote or some more features. It's just a basic Excavator. No sounds, no special features. a little overpriced."
2,Cheap and the bits break in half with very little force.,"I bought these 1/8"" drill bits because I have to install/drill out several 1/8 pop rivets on my car and I can tell you that these are very low quality. I have broken 4 or 5 so far and all I am doing is drilling out some aluminium panels. I haven't had this problem with other cheap 1/8"" bits that I bought from another supplier. They were about the same price but better quality."
3,Intense,"THis is a vey good book but, if you are looking for a sweet book that would not be this one. It is a great book but a little intense. It teaches you compassion for others and to get through hard times. Well, I hope you enjoy it."
5,Value and quality,"Several years ago we had to replace one of the keyed locks into our house. We chose this Schlage locking entry knob. It has worked flawlessly and still looks like new. So when it was time to replace more knobs, this is the style and brand we came back to. Looking forward to many years of beauty and flawless usage."
5,Wish I had one of these years ago.,Just as I hoped. Easy to install and use. Much easier and cheaper than filling the water heater with anti-freeze.
3,"Retooling for the ""New Economy""","This book along with author's ""Digital Economy"" and ""Blueprint to the Digital Economy"" rode the dot com wave. The author attempts to explain the variables in the ""new economy"" and what can one do to navigate and handle the change. It explains about the emerging new business models and how they will pretty much annihilate the existing way of doing business. A couple of years later when one looked around the valley the new models were all in tatters, i.e. the ventros, chemdex, autoexchange and all the other exchanges and hubs were on their death bed. The author's intentions were all good; he was tutoring the old world how to adjust to the new one, but the ""new"" wasn't as revolutionary (except in a few instance) as we all thought."
2,The material is old....,"This book might have been cutting edge 2 years ago with the hype that created the Internet Bubble. But, a lot has happened in the last couple of years that debunk a lot of theories put forth in this book.Several of the case studies that the authors tout as market destroyers are actually either going out of business or being bought for a pittance. Example Optimark.Also, the authors present a lot of theories without any depth. How to translate stories into actions. There is a lot of breathless discussion of disaggregation, reaggregation, but very little guidance on how do this in a complex companies. These simplistic ideas don't work very well in complex organizations with multi-layered value chains servicing different customer segments and product lines.My take-away was another attempt by so-called ""digital gurus"" to drum up consulting business."
1,are you joking?,"This is the Sam's Club house brand, available from any Sam's Club for $2 a can (5 cans for about $10 really). Who on earth would buy Sam's Club housed brand canned chicken through Amazon? At $8 a can? Ouch.Vendor is obviously a scammer taking advantage of Amazon Marketplace."
1,Amateur production values ruin what should be a great set!,"I ordered this set for the great 1937 recording of Beethoven's 5th symphony. That's not the only great performance on this 10 CD set by any means, but after 50+ years as a Furtwangler fan, I already owned most of the rest. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the transfer of the Beethoven's 5th recording had the first bars of EVERY movement clipped off, even the finale which is supposed to follow the 3rd movement without a break. Fortunately, I had a friend who was interested enough in the rest of the recordings on the set to take it, defects and all, off my hands. Unless you are similarly blessed, this offering is no bargain! Better transfers of the whole thing are available elsewhere, and well worth the added effort and cost."
5,Works fine,"Its sturdy, made of metal, holds everything together fine. No reason not to buy that I can think of."
4,Allows use of larger filters . . .,". . . on smaller lenses. No problems with threading or binding, no vignetting, seems durable, etc. Arrived early and quickly."
2,What happened to the metadata? Is this NOT a new CD?,"Ordered what was billed as a ""new"" copy of the Chris Isaak CD ""Chris Isaak"" from 1987. It arrived seemingly packaged like a new CD but when the wrapping was torn off, the CD case itself was not sealed. When I tried to rip the CD to iTunes, gracenotes did not recognize it; there was NO metadata available. I tried Windows Media Player as well--same result--no metadata. The CD does play and I was ultimately able to rip it but had to manually enter all the relevant data. My conclusion is that this is not a new CD but rather a pirated copy which does not instill confidence in the seller. I will not be purchasing from them again."
5,great value,"I ordered this guitar for my 4 yr old grandson for Xmas after he became interested in my guitar.The company did a fantastic job and it was shipped and received in time for Xmas .The guitar was surprising detailed not like those plastic ones you see in stores with fishing line strings..these were real steel strings with an extra string just in case.The only draw back so far has been in keeping the one of the strings taunt. There is an adjustment screw in the back of each tuning peg but if you constantly tighten it , it becomes loose..overall my grandson is completely amused with his ""tar""and spends hours playing us songs...thanks"
4,guitar4,"I bought this toy guitar for my 3 year old grandson and he fell in love with it. It looks just like a ""real"" guitar. In fact, he put it in his dad's guitar stand. It can't be tuned like a grown-up's, but for a 3 year old and considering the inexpensive price tag, it's just fine. If he continues to show an interest in music, I will buy him a better one. I will definitely shop at Austin Bazaar again....they were better than advertised."
4,Little House on Rocky Ridge,"In my opinion the book Little House on Rocky Ridge by Roger Lea MacBride is a great book.Based on the life of Rose Wilder and her family this book is as good as the ones abouther mother, Laura Ingalls Wilder. Rose and her parents are moving from South Dakota to find a better life. They had to move becausethe drought wouldn't let anithing grow. So in a covered wagon they headed to to Kansas in hope of a better life.On the way to Kansas Rose has fun looking at all the new things she hadn't seen before. During the trip Rose's mother shows her the money that will help buy the new farm, it's one hundred dollars.Rose promises that she won't tell anyone about it. But at the end of the trip when they are ready to buy the farm the money can not be found. The whole family gets very woried and dosn't know what to do.Rose and her family learn to be strong on hard times and go on with life."
4,Good Songs,"This is another album of good soul songs. Her voice is a rich contralto-(a deep voice soulful type of voice) are smooth and powerful. This is her best album since ""Help Yourself"". On the previous album, it was hit & miss with the ballads being the highlights. Here there is a better mix of songs like the mid-tempo dance track ""Mr. Right or Mr. Wrong"" which is my favourite. Other highlights are ""Your Divorce Has Been Denied"", ""Just Go Away"", ""This Time It's All About Me"", etc. A good album to have for R&B/Soul fans."
1,no,"this is a terrible book. not only is it written terribly bad, but the content seems to be nothing but the authors digestion of former failed relationships. you can read her anger through the lines. it is more like an extract of a diary, rather than a book written by experience and wisdom. a waste of time and money."
2,Not what i was looking for,"I didn't really like this book,it was not what i thought it would be and seemed a little on the Me,me,me side.It may however be helpful to someone else,just not me,as i was looking for help with emotional abuse and this was not a very big help at all."
5,Gets You Out of Misery + Extraordinary Read,"This is an exceptionally well written book, filled with unique, down-to-earth and important information that clearly brings you out of misery, while sharing how to maintain a solid sense of self, and self worth.There is wisdom on every page as the book addresses the many stages of a relationship, the way out of pain and suffering along with the importance of self truth and honesty within each stage.The relationship guidance jolts you out of misery with answers that are most engaging, on target as well as timeless.I found tremendous insight in every chapter that applies fairly and sincerely to both sexes. I also found this book to be an immensely enjoyable and insightful read."
5,This Book is a Must Read for Relationships,"The way this book was written went right to my heart, my mind, my soul and opened them all. Barbara Rose really has a gift with her clarity of expression, and the way she relates in the book it feels like you've made a new friend. The guidance in the book has already spared me from more pain in relationships. It made me wiser, and gave me guidelines that I can always follow that are just as fair for me as they would be for a man in my life. I've had my heart broken, and this book helped me come to terms with so much and resolve it all.This book is a MUST READ if you are looking for answers in relationships, because you will definitely find them!"
4,It helps when you are off track,"This book is motivating to read if you are having a lapse of judgment by being in a relationship where you are not being charished and respected, but only if it has not always been a problem for you. If you have no self esteem at all and are a chronic door mat in relationships, this book can't replace the need for therapy from a qualified professional. But if you just need a slap to awaken you again, this book is a fast, fun read."
1,That ain't no way to treat a career,"It's almost impossible to imagine how Bonnie could go this low and then spring back with something so perfect (or apt) as Nick of Time. One can only assume that it wasn't her fault. There's not much to recommend this album; it's so bland, flat and anonymous it could be by anybody. Bonnie's worst by a mile."
1,Stay Away From This One!,"As a long-time Bonnie Raitt fan, I have generally loved everything she's put out. However, this album marks the low point in her career. No direction, no focus, ""just lookin' for a hit."" No sense of self, really. Ick. I remember buying the album (the record, that is) at the time because I felt that Bonnie was never going to get the recognition she deserved and I needed to keep supporting her music. What a disappointment, even starting with the silly cover art. I've heard her do Crime of Passion in concert, and it sounds lots more soulful than this album would have you believe. She used to do No Way to Treat A Lady, too, but seems to (wisely) have dropped that from her set lists.After this came Nick Of Time and everything changed!"
4,"ITS A BONNIE RAITT ALBUM, WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY.","NINE LIVES IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BONNIE ALBUMS . IT HAS SOME HARD ROCKING NUMBERS LIKE "" NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY"", AND ""RUNNING BACK TO ME"" BUT ALSO HAS GREAT LOVE SONGS LIKE ""ANGEL"". AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS IT STILL IS A GREAT LISTEN. WHO CAN FORGET SIPPIE WALLACE'S VOCALS ON ""TRUE LOVE IS HARD TO FIND""."
1,Elliot Engel: POMPOSITY PERSONIFIED!,"Recently, I had the misfortune to hear ""Dr"" Engel's sleep-inducing Tent & Pony Show lecture on Margaret Mitchell & Gone With The Wind. The truth is, I have never heard or witnessed anyone who was so full of himself...and for so little reason! His condescending demeanor, both on and off the stage, was a genuine turn off. His ""lecture"", which was filled with half-truths and wild speculation, was followed by a shameless & tacky promotion to buy his VHS Tapes, books and DVD's. He actually set up a card table in the lobby and mercifully, after attempting to sell his wares, left without even a minimal ""thank you"" to his audience or hosts!"
4,"On its own, a masterpiece?","Here's the thing, recorded in the 80's it has a heavy synth feel to it. You've got your opinions on synth, it means synthesized, NOT synthetic. They are still real instruments, being played by real people. Add the haunting melodies of Miles Davis and you get an incredible juxtaposition of old and new.Now for the not so good part. This album was really the forerunner of the bland soft jazz that has been regurgitated for the past two decades. Sadly it created the groove for programmed backgrounds with moderately talented horn players to try their thing. IT'S STILL GOING ON. Heck, it's pretty much soft porn music.If you're familiar with that type of soulless jazz, you might get a feeling of it from this album, but this album has soul, make no mistake. Every classic has a thousand pale copies.I think if you can leave all preconceptions behind, you'll enjoy this album. It's solid."
1,An awful surprise,"After listening to the tracks Tutu and Full Nelson from the ""Miles Davis: Live Around the World,"" I decided to buy the original album. However, Tutu didn't meet any of my high expectations. It lacks talent, originality, and imagination. In fact, it is the worst Miles Davis' album I have ever heard!!"
2,Nice marketing story,This is a heavy and solid wine chiller that does look nice. My only issue is that while the beautiful story of Nambe is made in American the Nambe wine chiller I received is made in China. For made in China this piece is too expensive.
5,"Funny, witty and heart breaking. A must read.","I loved this book and re-read it every summer to get ready for the Miss America Pageant. This is not just a story on how to win a crown, but a funny, witty and smart look at American culture. The author has brought a fresh eye to a subject that could have been reduced to ""and then she wore ..."" The Miss America Organization is not just a one time a year pageant but a thriving company. Anyone who wants to invent and run their own business should read this story - not only are the contestants out to win, but so is Atlantic City and the Miss America Organization. A brilliant read. Did I say I loved it?"
5,Hooray the Barbarians are coming,I feel a kinship to the barbarians. The ate and drank anything. Killed and mamed innocent people. Belched very loudly. I felt like I was watching a home movie from my childhood.
1,Not a GREAT Mic,"This mic was great, for the short time it worked. I only had it for about 2 weeks or so before it quit working. I was glad I had only paid about $4 for it."
2,Disappointing Planescape adventure.,"The Deva Spark is an adventure for the Planescape setting and is disappointing. The concept is very good, but the player characters are basically 'railroaded' into the adventure at the beginning. In fact, if the charaters are reluctant to continue, they may be magically forced to finish by the Deva. And at the end, the characters must behave inconsistantly to accomplish the final goal. Clever DMs may be able to salvage the interesting plot and make a better adventure with the idea, but it few will find it worth the trouble. Not recommended."
4,A better than average text book.,This middle school physical science text book is better than average with plenty of concept simplifying illustrations and down to earth readability. I purchased this for use with an online home schooling program which doesn't have a corresponding textbook and it works well.
4,Hucks are taking over faster than spotless Appys!,"He is gorgeous, but he doesn't stand well, and there are way too many at shows. I took my Huck to my first ever breyer show, thinking he was a shoo-in to win he was so gorgeous, but in the Arab in hand class they were ALL Hucks, 12 of them. He won second place. The next show, for the sake of originality, I entered my Copper. We showed against 9 Hucks, and a few other Arab models. Didn't win a thing. The Hucks swept the board. 1-2-3. They werent even is as good condition as my Copper. Hmph. Well, I guess those judges know which side THEIR bread is buttered on. If you want to win at shows, get a Huck."
4,I'm loving it!,"As a Swedish-American it's a great read. I love her sly comments about Norwegians which are really funny. Like the recipes, too, as they add to the flavor (excuse the pun) of the country.This is only my second Faith Fairchild book so I am not missing her. Plan to read more in the series."
4,Great fun for a Norwegian American who visited the setting,"As a mystery lover who prefers books with humor, for me this was a delightful reading experience. The characters seemed like people I know and the plot was fresh and intricate enough to keep me guessing.Best of all, this book has the local color and flavor that beautifully refreshes my memories of my visit of 25 years ago to the Norwegian setting of this book.Even as a devoted user of the public library, I felt inspired and bought copies for my mom and a traveling literary cousin!"

5,Listen to it over and over,I love this CD! It's definately one of my all time favorites - a classic.
3,Not What I Expected,"This CD was a bit of a disappointment to me although the three singers are excellent. I didn't particularly care for most of the music. I had heard somewhere along the way that this CD - ""Trio"" was supposed to be outstanding. I really didn't think so"
5,Beautiful voices,"I wore out the cassette and am upgrading to the CD. This is a collection of some of the best harmonies I've ever heard! These ladies are wonderful individually! As a trio, the are fantastic!!"
4,Very nice,My grandmother loved the video. There were alot of patterns and designs that she grabbed onto. Easy to understand the instructions and I'd recommend this to someone who want to learn a few tricks.
1,terrible,"The animation in this OVA is great, but that's about it. The music has none of the soul or feel from the original anime. There's a bad over reliance on sheer blood, gore and guts. Long winded story. Glad I watched a mate's copy of this and didn't waste my money on the series. Can't say I'll be buying it. The original is far superior in every aspect (other than the aforementioned animation itself). Yes, I know the OVA runs more true to the original manga, but crikey, they've *ruined* this. Volume 4 hardly has an Alucard in it at all!Avoid at all costs.Dave"
4,Basic Instincts,"This book is a must if you've ever wondered why it's easier to hunt deer with a computer game than it is to hunt the real thing. A computer (and the brain, according to some physicists) operate under Boolean theory. A program contains all possible scenarios at once, with overlaps in some segments of each. A specific inquiry narrows the choices, but ultimately, there is only one outcome. Fred Alan Wolf attempts to explain the variable 'instinct' that is the ancient universal holding place for all knowledge. Instinct can't be duplicated by a computer, so it must exist in a Quantum environment. A semi-conscious state like a dream would be necessary to access such an environment. An excellent thought-provoking read."
2,Not the best in the series.,"In this his third book featuring Bernie Gunther, the ex-Police Officer, now private investigator, Philip Kerr picks up a few years after the conclusion of The Pale Criminal. World War II has ended and Germany is now the occupied country. Germans are having to deal with the different zones controled by The United States, England, the Soviet Union, and France. On top of that, a new kind of war is simmering, the Cold War. And the Soviets have begun the process of isolating the eastern zone under their control.Amidst this new climate, Bernie Gunther has been hired to try to find the true killer of an American soldier. The story is a typical crime mystery and as I said when I reviewed its predecessor, Gunther is not the most endearing protagonist in the genre. But Kerr's way of describing that part of the world during such a dark period in history keeps me continually intrigued with this series."
4,The Smell of Hopelessness,"Post-WWII decade and corruption permeates Philip Kerr's A GERMAN REQUIEM. Brown and grey are the only colors. Tired and exhausted are the only physical attributes. And, utter lawlessness and immorality is the norm. Not a pretty picture, and yet Bernie Gunther tries to makes his way through the filth without becoming too decadent himself, but just to survive causes Gunther to sink to new lows. The plot is somewhat predictable, but Kerr's writing is still quite good. The pages turn easily and the overwhelming sense of noir--there can be no assumption that any good will ever happen to you--never departs."
2,Poor Quality Printing,The book was obviously printed from a scanned image and not from an original text file. The text is somewhat uneven and fat. Such poor quality text does not make for pleasant reading.
4,A Master's Reference,"This book has become my bible. Anytime a customer wants to be more informed, I bust out this book and walls fall down. I just sold another diamond! A reference to end all references. I would recommend this schizay to anyone."
5,a good monopoly game,I like this monopoly game because you can take it with you.It's like plying a real monopoly game. So buy this game and you will have the expirence of plying a real classic monopoly game.
4,tragic thougths journal,"i liked that half of the page is with lines and half without, so you can draw on one page and write something next to it.the lights wich blinks on the cover is a nice touch."
1,Cheaply made and breaks easily,"This product is extremely poorly made. It broke the first time my 9yo daughter tried to put it on a horse. She was so excited after ordering it with her birthday money, waiting for it to arrive, and then it breaks in the first 2 minutes! Breyer should be ashamed of themselves. I rated it as a ""1"" for fun because there was no time to play with it before it broke. Otherwise, it would heve been great.Many of the Breyer dolls and accessories are very overpriced (not to mention the horses) and are very cheaply made. They are made in China, probably for pennies, and then sold at rediculous prices here. They need some good competition with better made products so they aren't in such a position to rip us, and our children, off."
5,Another Winning Breyer product,The selling point for this product for my 10 year old was the adjustablility. Yes its is BUT beware as you can imagine it is very fiddly to put back if you should pull the straps too far - easpeciall the head collar part. Daughter was delighted with this.
2,Pump It Up from The Experts!,"Pump It Up is from the movie The Experts!! Starring John Travolta, thats why I like it! I don't like rap but Pump It Up is really neat!!!"
3,Lean on Me,"CD was bought for ""Lean on Me."" Everything was fine as far as the seller is concerned. I'm just not a big fan of Club Nouveau."
2,something special for me,It was about a girl who was picking out a present for herself. Her mom was buying it for her. She didn't know what to pick. But finally she decided. Read this book to find out what she picked.
5,Flying Through the Galaxy.,"STAR PILOTS is actually an inaccurate title for this young readers Star Wars book. The book really doesn't have much to say about pilots, but is all about space craft flown in the Star Wars universe. While there are a few non-space vehicles described, e.g. podracers, most of the book is dedicated to famous Star Wars vehicles. X-Wings, TIE Fighters, the Millenium Falcon, the Executor, Slave 1, and the Invisible Hand are all mentioned as well as escape pods and Republican gunships. The book is filled with pictures from the movies, which makes it attractive for young readers. Though this is a level 3 book, many of the words seem more difficult than that too me. However, the books chronological order makes it easier to make sense of it all. Overall, this is a great book for young Star Wars fans."
5,Best GPS I have ever owned!,I have had a few different GPSs in the past and this one out performs all of them. It is very convenient to have it on my PDA which I have with me all the time anyway and I works great having the entire US on one map.I love it.
3,"Nice music, but bad surround mix","I love Bach, and almost anything of his sounds good to me (if well-played, of course). But I had to downgrade the rating on this DTS disc because of the awful surround mix. Not only are the rear channels louder than the front (the orchestra seems to be behind you), but the levels vary noticeably from track to track (by about 6dB from loudest to softest).So 5 for musicality, and 1 for surround mix = 3 rating!This review refers to the DVD-A:Bach Classics [DVD Audio/Video]"
2,Wouldn't buy it again,"It's hard to read this book because of the tiny font, even at home, to say nothing of reading it when you're in another country, sweating in the oppressive heat, and in a hurry. I can do better with wikitravel -- print it out at a readable font size.Then there's Lonely Planet's penchant for describing everything in glowing terms -- when everything is awesome, you wonder if you can trust the source, and it defeats the point of buying a guidebook.Consider wikitravel first -- print out the Singapore page, and ones for specific areas in Singapore, like Riverside or Orchid."
3,Info is outdated and sometimes misleading,"The book is a great guide to Malaysia and Singapore's historical and cultural background, but extremely misleading in terms of road guidance and local customs. The sights listed in the book were mostly dull. It might be that I am from Asia and the temples in there just don't really interest me. Also, because it was published nearly two years ago, it didn't cover everything up-to-date. There are no words mentioning Universal Studio in Santosa island, Singapore, and the recommendations of local restaurants isn't the best people can try out.And the tours listed in the book was very disappointed. We got lost in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown when we tried to follow the walking tour, since the map was old and there wasn't enough guidance in directions.Again, it might be a great guide for westerners who visit Asia for the very first time in their lives, but not for asians who already come from the area."
1,Very Few Info on KL,"This is not a recommended book if you have only some days in KL. Lack of information. Too many detail about points of interest, restaurants and hotels were uncovered.The Singapore should have to be improved as well. Better to buy the LP Singapore separately rather than buying this book.Probably the worst LP guide that I ever read..."
5,Best Health book I've ever read,Jason does it all right here. Diets don't work and won't ever work. I love the fact I can eat anything I WANT whenever I want. This book is revolutionary and should be required reading for every human in a developed world.
4,I Enjoyed It,"I really liked the book.I love reading about Maine - so i hunt for any and ALL books about it. I also read TONS, and many different types of books. No, the author is not a professional writer by trade; i still enjoyed what she had to say...i got laughs from the book, and learned alot about lobstering."
3,No Story,"A fitting title, but no story here other than the quiet life of a tomboy and her father. Nothing really happens, at least not in a way that was interesting to me. I enjoyed the book, I was relaxed by the book and I learned from the book. But in the end Lobster Chronicles was a bit lite for me. I never really got to know or understand any of the characters, the author included. I did not read her 1st book about sword fishing, but must assume it was better written than this one.Michael Durankowww.bootism.com"
3,Review for journal...,"The journal provides a very good writing service except I didn't like the color of the cover of the journal and I think that there weren't enough pages in it. So if you're looking for a journal to write in for a very short period of time and don't care what color it is, this is for you!"
3,A Good Weekend Read,"""Outbreak"" grabbed my attention right away with the ebola story set in Africa. Dr. Cook knows his stuff and for a story written circa 1986-1987, I don't think it's too outdated. This is my first stab at one of Cook's books - I'd probably read more."
3,"Entertaining, but predictable","Robin Cook does it again. This was actually the first of his books I had read, but I am free to say that as I am now familiar with more of his work. Does anyone else think that his stories are somewhat predictable?Outbreak is an entertaining read, but it is so predictable. I knew who the informant of Marissa's activities was by the first quarter of the novel. The fact that Marissa didn't was a source of infinate agitation for me during this read. This woman is supposed to be intelligent, but she doesn't have a whit of common sense. Also, the bad guys are...dumb. No other description suits them except that they are incredibly stupid.Another pet peeve of mine is Cook's prose...not exactly Shakespeare is it? Cook is a mediocre writer at BEST, and this is one of his better novels.If you want a medical thriller that is a quick, easy read and is completely average, then Outbreak is for you."
1,Made Baby's Eczema Worse,"I was desperate to relieve baby's itchy red eczema. This didn't work at all. In fact, it made the eczema angrier! I wonder if baby is sensitive to one or more of the ingredients. I wouldn't say the product is bad in and of itself... just that it didn't work for me."
2,The ingredients aren't that great,I bought it for my baby but will not use it. THe ingredients are pretty bad. I will stick to my organic shampoos.
1,This one is Useless,"Installed phone per instrucion manuel, handset will not recongize the base unit. $70.00 wasted. I am in Iraq and dont't have the means of returning defective product. Oh Well we are use to getting the big one."
1,This thing is Delicate like a flower.,I used it twice before the retracting pin mechanism failed on me. After one more use the pin pulled off entirely leaving me out the 30 bucks I paid.
1,2 strikes on Amozon in one week,This is the second item I've purchased in less than a week that doesn't work and that's sad that I will be sending this junk back also. The display screen doesn't come on five minutes out of the box put the batteries in and Ooops no screen but have sound WTF!!!!! I am new to amazon for purchasing and it's not looking good and may just go back to the over priced EBay people because I never had these problems before ...
1,Really Awful...,"Based on comments about his other books maybe some day I'll try one of them...but this book was REALLY BAD. I'm an intelligent college-eductaed guy that reads 1-2 books per week (of all types) and I simply couldn't follow the story here. A muddy, improbable mess!"
1,"A Dark, dismal, depressing, disappointing dud","I could not find ONE character in this book who had any likeable or ""redeeming"" qualities. A book with NO characters to whom one can relate is NOT a ""good"" book in my opinion. By the end of the book, I was hoping that ALL the characters would be dead. Talk about the ""scum of the earth!"" This book has them all."
1,Terrible,"I quit reading on page 214. (The book has 322 pages.) I found the plot annoyingly confusing, mostly due to the fact that I did not care about the characters. Avoid this book. Stick with Rice's previous two novels."
3,More Twists and Turns Than a Roller coaster,"I really wanted to like this book. And if I had not read his other two exellent offerings (A Density of Souls and The Snow Garden) then I would have rated this book higher. But I know he can do better! The twists and turns became tiresome. Usually, Chris's books have layers that are revealed at a satisfying pace, without sacrificing his usual knack for creating a mood and atmosphere. But in Light Before Day, I was kept guessing: is this a story about methaddiction? Child porn? Personal revenge? In the end I just didn't care; too bad, because the ending packed a punch that was dulled by the insane pace of the plot. I'm going to re-read The Snow Garden and hope for better things next time!!!"
2,disappointed,"This clock does not illuminate in the dark. I would have loved it if it had done so but since it does not, I am very disappointed in it."
1,Awful,"I've bought a fair amount of watch tools on Amazon, and this is the first that doesn't really work. Yeah, you can kinda get it to work, but it is so poorly made, it can't keep the right spacing and will slip and scratch the back of your watch. This is NOT worth the $."
2,"Yes, this is a $6 tool","Having just received this tool in the mail, I honestly haven't used it on any watch. However, a cursory examination of the various parts that came with the tool gives me an idea why this tool cost me $6: its components are/look cheap.The watch case wrench comes with 15 bits, 3 bits forming a triad. Two of those triads are round 1 mm bits, one is round 2 mm, and the remaining 2 triads are straight 5 mm. The round bits are fine. The 5mm bits however as completely inconsistent. Some aren't even straight, which makes me wonder how they are supposed to grip a watch back properly.The tool will likely work on a watch. However, if you are in the least bit persnickety about your watch back, this is not the tool for you.On a side note: given the number of Jaxa-type tools on Amazon, it is really frustrating that one cannot tell if a $15 tool is better than a $5 tool. What do watchmakers use and do they get their tools from Amazon?"
1,"garbage, don't buy this","I thought this tool would be like the type my favorite watch repair shop uses to open the backs of watches. It isn't. Its a flimsy object that doesn't work....and the seller know it - I complained about the product and asked for a refund. The seller refunded me in full, and told me not to return the tool."
5,Big Zippo Fan,"Considering I'm a stock horse lover, I went out and got the midstates release of this mold in appaloosa(got from Gebos).And I also have the Zips Choco Chip.The connisour models are even better. I wish I knew where to get them. This mold is an EXECELLENT western performance shower!!"
1,How dare they?,"This game is bad. Really bad. Whoever tested this game either was ignored or didn't actually play it. Many holes. Many bugs. Okay to look at. And you have lots of time to look at things while your character is stuck in mid air after trying to jump up nearly anything in the game. Really lackluster launch title for the PS3. I was looking for something along the lines of 'Baldur's Gate', this doesn't stand up even to those standards."
3,Not too bad,The game is not too bad far a launch title. There are some difficulty curve issues as you progress through the game which can make for frustrating play. You go from super easy fights where you dominate to the omg type let me run and get some healing fights within 2 areas.
5,iFP 899,"My first MP3 player, and I'm thrilled! The headphones are Sennheiser, and more than adequate, it will play MP3, VBR, and WMA, and the software, while not as convenient as drag-drop in explorer, is very intuitive. The USB 2.0 is fast. Another poster said that you cannot transfer to your computer, but I have done so with no problems, drag and drop."
3,surge protector,"As a power distribution center the surge protector works fine. It appears to be a robust device, however, I hope I never have to test its capabilities!"
5,"Their most well-rounded, entertaining album.","Pop Kulcher Review: While New Order's earlier albums retained some elements of the band's gloomy Joy Division days, later efforts were a schizophrenic blend of quieter, more melodic stuff and upbeat dance numbers. On Brotherhood, both sides of the band are at their strongest, with catchy dance numbers like ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" and ""Weirdo"" balanced by some gentler numbers. The guitar/keyboard interplay is particularly impressive, making the band a much more musically intriguing rock and roll act than most of the synth-oriented bands who dominated the Euro-pop dance scene in the mid-eighties."
1,Terrible,"A very poor book, I returned after the first day. You will guarantee yourself loads of frustration if you buy this."
1,How utterly disappointing...,I bought this with the hope of having a good Egyptological romp. I wound up scanning it and wishing it was over. The story is all over the place. Characters come and go and do absurd things. Even the epilogue is a pathetic add-on.Don't waste your money or your time.
2,Lacking in Development on all Fronts,"One cannot say that the author lacks in writing skills. He has all the basics there for plot development, character development, and timing. Unfortunately, he never moves beyond the basics. His hodgepodge of characters are interesting as abstracts, but are never fleshed out. In fact, some of them (like Oldcastle) are downright unbelievable. His main character's personal history of childhood, marriage, and divorce are superfluous to the plot and can easily be skipped over because they don't add depth to the story's main line. Then, to top it all off, the story's conclusion is wholly unsatisfying. Mick's word ""bollocks"" while he hovers near death in the hospital pretty much sums up the whole point of this look at the Stela Paser. Again, there's no question the writer has the potential to put together a basic story, but he shows no real talent at or proclivity to flesh it out in a way that would satisfy a reader."
2,I'll look forward to Bondurant's next work.,"As an Egyptophile, I looked forward to reading Matt Bondurant's novel after seeing a positive review of it in the Washington Post. And indeed, the premise sounds promising: a down and out translator working in the British museum attempting to translate a mysterious stele. There is no doubt that Bondurant's writing shows promise, I found some of his passages frankly stunningly beautiful. These are in contrast to some of his scatological details about his protagonist's flatmate that became tedious. But it is the plot that needs some work and lacks umph. Nevertheless, I will look forward to Bondurant's next work because of his skill as a writer."
2,The Third Translation,"Based upon the hype, I hoped to find a new author with the fantastic page-turning abilities of Dan Brown, Steve Berry, James Patterson, and others. The book is loosley held together, and quickly becomes a muddied mess. I completed it only out of a sense of obligation to the money I'd spent. Bondurant has potential, but he needs to develop his main ideas more effectively."
1,"I wish I could give it ""0"" stars.","I am kicking myself for being suckered into reading this book by all of its comparisons to ""The Da Vinci Code."" It was painful, but the only thing that made me finish it was the fact that I wasted perfectly good money on the thing. Egyptology, history and mystery (the three foremost things touted by the advances for this book) take a far second seat to the drab ""hero"" who we are apparently suppsed to pity because he consciously makes poor choices throughout his life. Finally, I have never seen a book--even one that clearly contemplated a sequel--leave so many loose ends flapping about. Honestly, there was no sense of story closure at the end and that only compounded the frustration I felt from reading the thing in the first place."
1,The worst book I ever read.,"This is my first review. Usually, if I don't like a book, I'll just keep it to myself. However, this book is so awful I had to let other people know. I did finish the book with a ""it's got to get better"" attitude, but the only thing on my mind when I finished the last sentence was ""how did this book even get published?""."
4,A Brilliant Teacher,"If you liked this book, you will probably enjoy ""A Brilliant Teacher"" about a family that had a similar year-long adventure, but with very different experiences because they were on a limited budget. Those limitations lead them to meet lots of interesting people and have quite interesting adventures with their three children.A Brilliant Teacher: Lessons Learned from One Family's Journey Around the World"
5,brooding sounds,"This is a compilation of Dadamah's two 7"" singles tacked onto the 6 track ""This is Not a Dream"" LP. Also included is the 1 minute long ""Flies Inside the Sun"" track originally released on a 7"" X/way comp.The music is moody and dark. Featuring such South Island superstars as Roy Montgomery on guitar and vox, Kim Pieters on bass and (very unique,) vox, Peter Stapelton on drums and the previously unheard of (by me at least,) Janine Stagg on keyboards.If you know these artists you will have a fairly good idea what to expect. Hazy, narcotic sounding music with dark Stapelton lyrics.Janine Stagg, although being the lesser known, contributes some great atmospheric keyboards and synth. Somewhat similar to a less psychotic Mick Elborado.All in all an awesome CD of post-velvets haze."
5,GREAT,I BOUGHT AT LEAST 6 OF THESE AND HAD NO PROBLEM WHAT SO EVER. I USE IT WITH MY WEBCAM ALL SIX TOGETHER. IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT
3,Not Great with Wireless Adapters,"These cables work fine. I am using them to extend a Netgear Rangemax wireless adapter. I can only use 2 cables together on one pc [XFX 680i board], and 3 together on an old Dell dimension [weird]. I'm sure that 4 or 5 cables could be hooked together and run most devices, but a wireless adapter cannot maintain communication over more than 2 or 3 of these cables."
4,Good old 2 ring,We have a large kiddie pool with a canopy and stuff but i wanted a smaller one for our dog and on days when it wasn't necessary to whip out the larger one that takes a while to inflate and a lot of water to fill. This is perfect. Goes up and down easy and doesn't empty the tank to fill. Put it in the shade for the kids (i'd say 2 max comfortably) and your good to go.
1,Defective,"This pool was cute, unfortunately the caps to hold the air in would not stay closed. The pool keeps springing open and letting all the air out while my son plays in it. Also, my husband complained about the turpentine smell as he blew it up. He felt sure it was full of chemicals - not exactly something I want my baby playing in. Now I'm off to search for a nicer pool. This one was a loser."
3,A little disappointing,"I don't normally do reviews on Amazon, but I feel like I have to at least be honest with this item. I love The Guild. It's one of my favorite web shows, and it's something I could watch over and over again without getting tired of it. That being said, this is easily the weakest ""season"" of the series so far.It may be because they aren't playing ""The Game,"" or it may just be a little too far out in left field for me, but I didn't find myself enjoying this season as much. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments. But there were times when jokes seemed a little too cliche, or there were cameos of people who I had no idea who they were...yet they were treated like people who I should immediately recognize.I would recommend that people watch this one online first before buying it. It's not a waste of money or anything, but you may want to try to get it at a discounted price, if possible. Or buy it anyway to support the show."
1,...something happened on the way to Season 5...,"...and IMHO, it was not good.I own Seasons 1-4 on DVD, and up to that point, I love the show, but after seeing Season five, I will simplypretend the show ended with them all going to a Con and off into the wild blue gaming sunset.Season 5 really jumped the shark only here they used a remote control steampunk airship the gang built instead.The result had the same effect.TOTAL LAMENESS(.)Even if someone could explain to me just HOW such a thing could fly...never mind, I'm done.THE GUILD was (and still is) a favorite of mine...ending at Season 4.So Thanks for that."
5,Felicia Day,Need I say more. She is the Queen of all things geek. I have so much love for her. She turned a small web series into something huge. If you play video games or just like geeky shows this is a must for you.
5,Country music extrodinaire!,"Dolly Parton, Emmy Lou Harris, and Linda Rondstadt sound fantastic together. I don't usually listen to country music, but I'm going to spend time getting to know this genre."
1,HAHAHA,"Oh lord, this thing sucks.Spawn looks like Batman and Spiderman had a baby, ate it, and then puked it up again."
4,Good movie for the horse lover in us,The movie was great though if you saw the tv series first you will be very confused as the clair tess personality is basically swopped. Other wise was a great movie and i loved it. Pg enough for the whole family but a gripping story that even the adults won't be bored.
2,Bad,"It messed up during the movie,got stuck and skipped, and it was not as good as the series. Just didn't care for it"
4,It's got cool special features,"I can tell you it's so nice to have the English voice stars being interviewed after the first Inuyasha series came to a close seeing Richard Ian Cox, Monica Stori, Kelly Sheridan, Jillian Michaels, Kirby Morrow and Scott McNeil. I even got to meet the guys from these interview clips when they came to Toronto. I know Inuyasha fans would love to get a copy of this DVD."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book has lots of nice pictures.. but for learning home networking it is juvenile and lacks depth of explanation across multiple network routers, connection nodes, and how-tos. Don't waste your money."
4,GREAT STARTER,This book is excellent for the price and with a handyman mentallity you might be able to figure our the blind spots yourself and commence your pond.
2,only if you're in the mood...,"Cat Power are basically a one-trick pony, and if you've gone so far as to get to this page, you know what I'm talking about. The minimalist/somber approach can provide for a good listen when you're in the mood, but it's not a place you'd like to be for long, or very often for that matter. No new ground is broken on this new album. In fact, any one song by Cat Power is representative of the entire catalog. I can only hope that the ""band"" will try to break ground in their live shows, which are fast becoming a pathetic joke: No conviction whatsoever, feigned boredom, and false starts to songs while Chan Marshall acts like a five year-old, pouting, complaining, and making a complete clown out of herself, while she practically begs the audience to feel as sorry for her as she does for herself."
4,malone,"i use to own this movie on vhs ,i like very much ,burt reymolds movie and this one i like it a lot .this movie was not a big production but it has hids merits ."
2,It's a whole different band!,"My personal opinion: Make Some Noise is still the benchmark disc for this band. Only Mars Williams remains from the earlier recordings and while he's good, this disc just doesn't cook the way Make Some Noise did. I'd give this one a pass."
4,Poor reproduction.,"These CDs are poorly produced technically. The brightness ocillates from lighter to darker. This is probably some copy protection scheme, but it is a noticable degradation of the quality. I will probably return this set and try for better viewable copies off of tivo. Honestly purchased copies should be better, not worse quality, than broadcast. (PeeWee is great, however, even though the final shows are clearly running out of steam and jokes.)"
1,how did this band get signed?,"Are record companies desparate these days, this band is awful they try to be metal but fail.I would not recommend spending money on this its very bland & boring...."
3,I Wished for More,"Jo Goodman's More Than You Wished was lacking as a sequal to Rand and Claires' story. Part of the problem was in the printing chapters seven and eight were printed twice and nine was omitted entirely. There were to many issues touched on briefly surviving a rape, domestic abuse and racial discrimination. It would have made a better story to take one of these substancial issues and explore it more. It was nice to have Luke's character as gentle as he was with Bria. I liked their relationship but the story didn't flow."
2,Constant Head-Hopping,"There is one thing I can't get over in this book...the non-stop head-hopping. It seems like every paragraph changes POV, and I have to stop and backtrack to figure out who's thinking. It keeps taking me out of the story, so I really can't continue with it. It doesn't seem logical that she would be sitting there in a job interview (and how did she see every detail of his body when she was sitting behind a desk? and why did we have to know every detail of everyone's body down to their fingernails?) and freely tell him (a stranger) about her family's buried treasure.Overall, it's the head-hopping I can't get behind."
3,Too simple.,"I bougth this book to read about new features in java 1.1. Well, what I found is only a simple intro to each of new java 1.1 concepts.The idea isn't bad but isn't used in the best way."
2,Frustrating Puzzle!,"I am writing this review on behalf of my 6 year old grandson. He just put this puzzle together and was SO frustrated by the warped pieces that would not lay flat on the table. The puzzle comes apart when you touch it. This is, in most part, due to the pieces of puzzle that are ""warped"" for some reason. Perhaps we just got a bad batch of puzzle pieces???"
2,Fennel Seeds,Ordered this thinking it would help with weight loss. I guess it would but if you have IBS it gives you diarea. Thanks but no thanks.
3,okay,"I like Laura Mercier cosmetics but this is just your average lip balm in a plastic case. I was mildly disappointed to discover that, despite the lovely color of the balm, it doesn't actually add any color to your lips. There are many lower-priced lip balms that do the same thing this one does."
4,"Bright light, big box","Bought this as a gift for my teenage niece who is a budding artist. She loves how the lightbox enables her to trace pictures. She says it even shines through a piece of Bristol. However, it is a bit bulky and difficult to store. Overall, she is happy with it."
5,Exc,"I required a light box to sort 30 years of slides my family had hidden in the back of a closet. Being retired ,everyone is thinking of things I can do to keep me busy. it does no good to inform them, that I have plenty to do without help. The Light Box makes it much easier to view and sort the slides. The subject Light Box is all that was advertised with a great price and rapid delivery."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"When we purchased this game for our daughter, we had hoped that it would be similar in design to The Princess and the Pauper computer game. However, we were soon disappointed. The Princess and the Pauper requires mouse work and problem solving. This game does not use the mouse and requires that the child use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control the Barbie. It doesn't seem that the child has to think nearly as much with this game. Instructions are scant, and if the wrong direction is pressed, the whole view on the screen is changed and it is difficult for a child to get this corrected. Our 6 year old used her birthday money to purchase this game and was extremely frustrated and disappointed by it. She played it for about 10 minutes before giving up and going back to a mouse controlled game that she could actually enjoy. I would not recommend this game to anyone."
1,TOTAL JUNK! Kids are crying cuz they cannot complete the game,"O.K., we have many other Barbie games, and enjoy all of them (especially Prince & Pauper) with out grandchildren. This one is an exception, though. Poor (archaic) graphics, poor interface (cursor keys), poor action (cannot control movement).... and cannot complete the game. Trying to make a cat chase after flowers around a gazebo (with cursor & enter keys), only to lose the flowers as soon as you get one - is frustrating as hell.I'm a programmer, and tried it myself. Now I see why the kids are crying. How frustrating to play a game for hours/days, only to find out that it cannot be completed. Mattel/Activision should be ashamed.What is the recourse for customers that have paid for this game? Oh, yeah, I forgot. Once you open it, you cannot return it. No more Mattel or Activision games for us."
4,Very informative,"This book was recommended to me by a nurse. I was having terrible side effects to cholesterol medication, and my doctor kept urging me to stay on it, despite the side effects. This book informed me that these side effects were nothing to mess with, and could cause serious harm to my liver and kidneys. I just hope I didn't find out too late. I use people to use this, when a doctor gives you a new drug, or one that doesn't agree with you. I really believe if I hadn't stopped the zocor when I did, I'd be dead."
3,Evan,I really loved this book. The rough and tumble cowboy trying to escape the overtures of a young woman he considers to young for him. It is one book in a trilogy. A+++
1,Lousy,"Seller said would ship via USPS. Now its says Fedex and shows package as delivered, but I haven't received it! It was a Christmas gift and is not here. Ordered December 15th, not shipped till December 22nd. Lousy."
3,"So, so",These discs are more like frisbees-thicker and harder than the innova ones I have. My husband prefers the innova discs.
1,These do not hold a gallon!!,"I just opened the shipment and pulled out an alleged gallon sized bag. It was tiny & would hardly hold a quart, let alone a gallon size of anything. Don't bother with these bags. They are defective and/or mislabelled."
1,It lacks realism,A nice try but to far from any serious entry into the realm of true mystery. This novel is so full of holes.....like the great white water rafting in Michigan. Do your homework...there ain't no such place. A man overhears a plot to commit a murder and the case could have been solved in the first 20 pages if he had any brains. This took a lot of effort to try to finish it to the end. It appears the author is more concerned with adding as many Detroit area locals then providing a good mystery. All the reviews come from the Michigan area which says they must have come from a lot of friends trying to make the author look good. Don't waste your time.
5,If you use firearms you need this book,"By way of background, I use firearms every day- for work, hunting and recreation. I thought I had a very considerable knowledge of ballistics-both ""in flight"" and terminal, but then I read this book. It has information on everything connected to the way a bullet behaves, and covers the most obscure topics imaginable. Want to know how a rain drop affects a bullet? Its here. Want to know how many revolutions pre second your pistol bullet is going? Its here. Want information on whether a light load for your 7mm magnum will cause a detonation? Its here (it does, actually).My only gripe is the type setting is extremeley dense, with poor paragraphing occasionally. In places this can make it hard to read, particularly with some of the more technical topics.Overall however, anyone who is interested in the technical side of shooting should own this. Its a gem."
5,customer,The product was very good. Alot cheaper than in the stores. And it was exactly the same thing. Im using it now and have no problems with it. The dealer wanted 3x as much.
5,Golf Ball Retriever,"6-4-12 Transaction was Spot On... This is the best. It's my third...only because I think someone ""lifted"" the other 2.I haven purchased a golf ball in over 30 years... The retriever is a great substitute when the swing isn't going right. 6-7-12 Said 6 day delivery...Received it the 2nd day... Outstading Amazon Seervice"
3,retriever,the wire that holds the bell in the basket was defective so it hasn't been that easy to use
3,"good songs, but disappointing production","I must suggest that you see Low perform live. It really helps in understanding what they are trying to accomplish on the album. This album experiments in reverb chambers, and natural reverbs as well as recording at different speeds (a trick that makes the recordings sound tired, not slow). Excellent string arrangements pushed my critique from 2 to 3. I had to get this to hear a 5 star 8-track basement recording other than Boston! =P Only 35 minutes of music. I would suggest The Curtain Hits the Cast over songs for a D-P."
2,Durable?,"One of the plates arrived chipped. (Hey, I bought this because I wanted something durable!) The mugs were made of a different material - ceramic or stoneware, probably because it would be difficult to hold a cup containing hot liquids. I didn't like the ""unmatched"" look. Received a full refund from Amazon."
4,Great everday,I have used Corelle for several years then decided to try stoneware. Stonewear chips and is heavy. Corelle is very durable and their products last for years. My old set still looked decent so gave it away instead of throwing it out. The sandstone color is very nice. The dinner plates and luncheon plates are a good size. The cereal bowls are a little small. I gave it a 4 star because they don't include the 12oz or 20oz bowls to the set. I have since purchased them to add to my set.
3,Broken,"I've bought this product before, and my bird loves it. However I am disappointed because the perch was cracked in the packaging and when I took it out, the perch was broken in two."
5,I like it!,"Puts off good light, easy to clamp on to the side of grill. While we were eating we put it in the middle of the table for the bugs and the noise it puts off and alternating between the 3 settings worked! Not 100%, but we saw a pretty big differance!"
4,Out-of-print but the best training manual,"I learned to soar in the 70s when Carle Conway's ""Joy of Soaring"" was the most widely used training manual. I haven't seen the more recent editions of the Conway manual but have recently re-read the first edition plus Derek Piggott's ""Beginning Gliding"" (1995 Ed.) I suggest that Wolters' is superior to both. No single manual contains everything one might want to know so perhaps study a few but buy this out-of-print book used. It gives best overview and explanations and is a very pleasant read."
3,I would give it a B-,"Not a bad novel, but disappointing after reading Death Roe first. A series of improbable events, characters and consequences made it see like a bad comic book brought to light. A .50 BMG caliber rifle used for poaching deer and wolves? Really? Why, for God's sake? Who would/could carry around a 15+ pound rifle in a stealthy manner, especially a female villain? Who could differentiate a .50 caliber wound channel from anything else as you would never recover a bullet unless you shot a T. Rex? Most .50 caliber rounds would exit with a .50 caliber hole and no expansion... and this was just one of many factual problems with this story. OK, it is fiction, but if it doesn't pass the ""sniff"" test, it is hard to enjoy......"
1,Book was missing a lot of commonly used words,"I was disappointed with this dictionary, especially considering Barron's is a solid brand."
2,"it was a good intent, but the result is very bad...","I bought this book to review the theory of signal processing, which I had studied 4 years ago. What caught my attention was that the author threats the 4 different Fourier representations at the same time, instead of separated, what seemed to be a great approach. But in the course of the reading I found that the lack of organization throwed away what could be a great idea. Sometimes I was so lost in the theory development that I prefer to give up and try another book. In the end I found myself studying (again) the Oppenheim's Signals & Systems, that treats the Fourier representations separately, but in a much more organized manner. So, as an advice, try another one."
3,"Good Knife, But not the Best","I own the Wusthof Classic 8"" Chef's, 3 "" Parer, Kitchen Shears, and the 7"" Santuko. I love all of my knives. My mother in law bought me this set for my birthday. I really wanted the 10 piece Classic, but who is to complain about a gift. These are good knives, just not the best. I would venture to say that in most kitchens this would be an improvement over the knives most people own. These are some sharp knives with good material. I am not as fond of them as my Classics, due to the balance and the feel of the knives. They do not have a bolster, nor are they full tang (from the top they look full but if you turn the knife over you can not see the tang) and they are not as heavy as I like. Still these are good knives. If this is what you can afford to upgrade your knives go for it, if you can spend a little more buy the Classic."
2,"Love Emeril, But knives are not high quality","Sorry Emeril..... Love you but not the knives.Bought this set less than a year ago. 2 knives have cracked across a rivet and one is rusting. I bought these for my husband to replace the Henckles that we have had to over 6 years, but these will not last.If I was going to buy knives, I would definately get ones without rivets in the handles. Get the solid handle, but make sure the metal goes up though it as well."
1,Night vision,this Binoculars is a pice of trash i can see very well at night and dosen't includes batteries.
5,the past shows the present and the future,"This book shows how the Gulf war of 1990-1991 war not only a product of the continued conflict US Imperialism has with the Iraqis and other peoples of the Middle East. It illustrates how the growing tension between the US ruling circles and the imperialist governments of Europe and Japan played a decisive role in the Gulf War. Those conflicts continue to deepen to this day. As such this book is not an abstract tool about dead history, nor is this book an abstract analysis for academic or journalistic voyeurs. It is a handbook on the realities of world politics for working people, youth, and oppressed people who want to struggle against wars, imperialism, and oppression."
1,"long on jargon, short on analysis; completely worthless","I picked up this book at an antiwar rally last year, assuming that it was about the current mess in Iraq; much to my surprise, this book was written many years ago, during the first Gulf War. So I thought I'd see if its analysis held up; the answer: not at all. The book is full of erroneous predictions, rendered in mystifying rhetoric, which I assume can only be understood by a few loyal followers of the author. The book does have one virtue: it is howlingly funny at times, although of course only by accident - so if you weary of theonion.com and the Daily Show, you might find it useful."
3,Good sampler,"This is a good collection of singles and B-sides. Though the second half of the album bogs down, there is still plenty here to make it a worthwhile listen. ""Panic"" has a sense of tension about it that makes it one of The Smiths' best songs. Other highlights include ""Shoplifters of the World Unite,"" ""Girl Afraid,"" ""You Just Haven't Earned it Yet Baby,"" and ""Ask,"" a song filled with urgency masked as a pleasant ditty."
2,Not the right size...,"These beach balls came quickly but when I inflated them, I found out that the actual diameter is not 20"" as it says in the description, it is actually only 13""."
2,Fanfic with a fancy cover,"This book could be called Slasher's Delight. The story itself wasn't bad for a ST novel.Why only two stars? Two words: Embedded Quotes.Any author or editor that would let an entire novel without proper dialogue in it should be throttled for letting a manuscript with this huge problem go to press. Any English teacher wouldn't let that slide.In a way, it's too bad the ficcers didn't get their hands on this before it went to press. They'd have straightened out the poor formatting."
3,"Its a very interesting book, but has a very limited audience",The book is loaded with information and I believe the author is right on with his commentary. Not sure many on the left will buy the story line. But they are very narrow minded anyway.
2,On Ego,"Taking maximum advantage of recent school shootings, Grossman's book is the epitome of media capitalization. Using censorship as his underlying agenda, Grossman uses poorly researched statistics in order to blanket the reader with simplistic conclusions about warfare, killing, and the psychology behind it. Not what I would call a thinking man's book. I found it rather insulting to my intelligence. Lacking a solid foundation of his OWN research, Grossman uses misquoted and often irrelevant information to purposefully paint a rather warped vision of how America reacts to media. Although Grossman raises a few interesting points, none are supported by facts, and they are primarily the brainchild of the author himself, who is rather lacking in credentials required by the subject."
5,Excellent,I first heard LTC Grossman speak at the Marion Military Institute dining-in (1997). After his speech I purchased his book. It is written very well and gives an in depth view of the ramafications of killing at every level and the effects it has in society. It should be required reading for military and law enforcement personnel.
1,I agree with Levi Kovacs review,"I agree fully with Levi Kovacs review. Grossman has opinions offerred as facts, and a large number of folks are willing to accept his opinions without researching themselves.If someone that has read his books checks out [...] you will discover a lot of information about Grossman and his opinions by professional Law Enforcement."
5,On Killing,"This is a fantastic book for anyone curious about how a soldier deals with the guilt and shame that is the end product of war and killing. Regardless of the macho image presented by Hollywood, the soldier in this book is accurately portrayed as both victim and perpetrator of death and dismemberment. It touches on the loss of comrades on the battlefield and the 1% who are predisposed to, or come to, enjoy it. A must read for those interested in PSTD and/or aspiring or accomplished writers."
5,Outstanding,Buy it without hesitation. This is a seminal work. It should be mandatory reading for every law enforcement person if they're serious about truly beginning to understand their work environment.
1,On Killing,"I can't give a review for this book because I have never gotten it. I have had no correspondence other than the confirmation of my order. There was no option as for rating the product other than the stars, so I had to choose the lowest one."
5,She loves it!,Bought this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it! She has a couple of the swarovski bear collection now and couldn't be happier with them. Guys - this one is a winner!
5,Vornado Heater...,I picked the Vornado Whole Room Heater not only because I needed to heat a large area but being elderly and having pets I wanted a heater that stayed cool to the touch. The information on it claimed it did both those things plus had an automatic climate control and reviews on it from people who had already bought one were favorable. I'm very satisfied with the heater finding it quiet and living up to all the claims on it.
2,Great Heater! but only last two years..........,"I've bought several Vornado heaters over the years-they are great heaters but they usually stop working after two years. Contact Vornado customer service and request a repair , you can usually get a new heater. Bought 07/2009, began dying 11/2011."
2,Heat...what heat...?,As someone mentioned in a previous comment it will maintain a heated room to a certain extent but doesn't do hardly anything from a cold start. Sometimes you feel 'some' heat and seems to work better on Auto rather than full High setting but that could just be me. For a $100 you definitely do better. Holmes had a similar model that used the heat the whole room design of 'low' but 'constant' heat and there no longer available last time I looked so I bought this one. Unfortunately it was a Xmas gift and past the 30 day return so I'm stuck with it. I guess I'll have to buy a $15 unit to supplement it on these single digit days.
2,would not recommend,"had it for three days in my office and while it was ""okay"" at heating the motor quickly broke and started rattling loudly. what steams me is that Vornados cost 2X comparable products and so would expect higher quality control -- pay a premium and still have to return to get one that works? no way. Bought a Lasko 755320 Ceramic Tower for 1/2 price and so far very happy with it."
3,"Worked fine, died young","I bought this item since it got good reviews here a few years ago. It was for taking the chill out of a cold bedroom on the harsher winter nights here in PA. It wasn't used to make the room warm, just to keep the temperature from going lower than 65 dergrees. Without a heater the room would go down to 62 degrees. I used it for 2 winters (again only very cold nights) and at the end of the second season it died. Not very impressive for the money. Secondarlily, I didn't care for the small LCD status panel that was hard to see.It did function well but I wouldn't buy one again."
4,Vornado VH2 Vortex Heater,"Vornado heaters have a reputation for superior performance, heating an average size room well through convective rather than radiant heat, doing so quickly and quietly and leaving few uneven spots. This unit is no exception. However, it developed a rattle in the fan within two weeks. Although it did not affect performance, it quickly became annoying. To their credit, Vornado sent me a prepaid shipping label to return the unit for repair under warranty, all shipping paid. However, their customer service did not respond promptly to my email, and I had to contact them by telephone to get my shipping label. My overall experience with Vornado products leads me to continue to recommend them with the caveat that they may be subject to some minor quality issues."
3,Usefull?,"Does live up to safety standards as advertised, and won't blow our fuses as promised but does not blow out the heat as set by thermostat and am considering returning under warranty. You can set it on 72-75 and temp does not get above 53 degrees. Setting higher does not help."
2,Defective ON/OFF switch,I bought a VH2 for an infants room.It worked very well for a while.Then the ON/OFF switch stopped working.It is stuck in the ON position.It can not be shut off unless it is unplugged.This thing is a fire hazard.I was lucky that I shut it off in time before it started a fire in our baby's room.I called the Vornado company but they want $25 plus shipping to fix it.All it needs is the switch.I asked if I could just send back the control panel.I am an electrician.Not worth it!I will never buy another Vornado product again.They use cheap parts made in asia and then want to rip you off to fix it.Why are so many electronic items made to just be disposable.If it was just made with better quality it would last more than a couple of uses.
1,Works great but doesn't last,"Do not expect vornado heaters to last more than 2 winters, if you are lucky. Normally they die within 1 year. Too much money for a heater that dies so soon."
2,"5 for heating, 1 for reliability","I have bipolar feelings about this heater. On the one hand, it is a fantastic heater that effectively warms a room, and has an automatic thermostat that really works. In terms of heating, it's great.On the other hand the design is almost ridiculously flimsy. The first one we had broke entirely within a week of use (thank goodness for Amazon.com's easy return policy). The second one has given us a lot of good heat, but the on-off switch broke after about six weeks. I can make it work through this strange gerrymandered solution, but now it sparks, in a frightening way.If it weren't so scary, it would be a joke. Like the type of heater you'd use to warm a haunted house.In all I can not recommend this product. Its a great heater, but its unreliable, and well, actually sort of terrifying."
1,Extreme Fire Hazard!,"This was a major rip-off. And also a safety hazard! After only 4-5 months of use, the heating element burned through the wiring on the fan and it shorted out. Sparks shot out of the socket, even when it wasn't on when I plugged it in. The plug isn't even grounded. Spend your money elsewhere and stay safe!"
2,not like my sons,fan only worked intermittently-heated fine but fan did not work correctly-I sent it back and will wait until next year for new model
2,Don't bother with a Vornado,"I started out with the least expensive model. It just wouldn't heat up a normal sized bedroom (and I don't live in a really cold part of the country), so I called them about it. Great customer service - they paid for me to ship it to them; said it was probably a defective heating element. Got the new one back . . . still wouldn't heat up a normal bedroom or office. Called to send it back again, and, upon my request, they sent me this upgraded model. It still just won't sufficiently head a room (10x10), but it works great in a 4X5 bathroom, set on high, auto. My opinion is the Vornado is simply not a good product. They have good customer service, but it just won't warm up a room nicely, and it gobbles power - every time I turn it on, my lights dim."
5,Great for a Fifth-Wheel!,I use this to keep a stable temperature all winter in my trailer. It's worked great for three straight winters..
5,Great product,This heater worked great right out of the box and if you use it for a bedroom you can lower the temperature which lowers the fan speed/heat settings for quiet operation. I would recommend this model over the 'Digital' models.I use this model in my Kitchen for chilly mornings and I use an older model which still works great in the bedroom at night instead of using the central heater. I do start using the central heater after temperatures stay in the thirties and low forties.
1,You call this HEAT?,"Even on its highest setting, this thing doesn't put out more than a tepid stream of air--if you're three feet away it feels like a cool breeze. The SUN can raise the temperature in this room faster than this so-called heater can. It goes back to Costco first thing tomorrow. The Presto HeatDish does a better job, but it doesn't circulate air."
1,Worked for 2 months and then stopped working,Definitely not worth its price. I bought this back in December and it's only February and it's already broken. The heat doesn't really circulate around the room so I still have to turn up my thermostat to keep warm. The fan has stopped spinning after a few squeaks. At first I thought it was because it has been overheated so I turned it off and turned it back on a few hours later. It continued to squeak and a few days later the heater/fan stopped working altogether. I do not recommend this product and I felt like I wasted 99 dollars and I can't even return the item.
1,Don't buy this heater,"I really can't say that unequivocally but based on my recent experience and the stack of negative comments I've perused on this site, I think this should be blurted out. We had ours for about 2 months before it stopped working. I'd heard about the recall (faulty switch) but procrastinated on taking action. Then it quit so it seemed a good time to send it back (my labor and box, their freight bill). In the meantime I bought a $17 one at a box store that worked fine - not real senstive, but quiet and steady. I just got the Vornado back and turned it on. It filled the job-site trailer with a haze that reminded me of burning plastic army soldiers - not that I ever did that..... We'll see how long before I have to plug cheapo back in."
1,Wrong Product,"I ordered a KitchenAid Blender Cutter and received a blender cover for an unknown blender. The packing slip noted it was a cutter. When I tried to return the product, the website process was circular, that is, following the links only led back to the original site. Lesson learned."
1,Broke my Kitchen Aid Blender to unrepairability within 4 uses,"This ""replacement"" part for my Kitchenaid blender damaged it the second use, and broke it irreparably the fourth use. Kitchenaid is irresponsible for not making true 6 pronged replacement pieces for their high end older blenders, because these two prong attachments chew up the gears and kill these old $100 blenders within a few smoothies. I think this part would work fine on two prong gear blenders, but destroy expensive equipment on older models."
2,Holder Business Cards,My purchase was very poorly packed for shipping and as a result 10% of the merchandise was broken. There was no packing materials inside the package so the contents were loose and fragile.
3,Average,"The size and picture quality are really good for the price, compared to other brands with 24"" screens.Beware, a big drawback is the cheap stand that doesn't offer the ability to adjust the angle of the screen. It leans forward/points down so I'm going to need to buy some rubber shims or something - a big con in my opinion."
1,Dead after 1 month,"Good picture, clear bright screen, but runs extremely hot if brightness is turned up. Lacks DVI input, requires DVI->HDMI converter for digital input from most computers. Also has VGA, component and composite video inputs, but converting digital video signal to analog (VGA) results in fuzzy picture. Wobbly stand.Now for the clincher: the unit died after one month. Westinghouse support is terrible. Three week wait to receive a replacement model. For an item this expensive, you would think Westinghouse would take better care of their customers. I do not plan to buy from Westinghouse again - by comparison, my NEC monitor has lasted 5 years and is still going strong."
1,"Poorly organized, a dis-service to previous editions.","I bought 3 of these books hoping to convince my students that they were excellent study aids. Instead I found that the pages of the books were literally repeated and that entire sections were missing. The old format was fine and the new structural changes were more annying than helpful. Mr. Leff, as a classroom instructor, I expected a better job!"
2,A summary of available products,If you're looking for a comparison of available windvane systems then you may find this book useful. It also has some maintenance tips for servo-pendulum systems.
4,Good fit for foot,"Warm, good fit in 8W, practical and good service and packaging. Not a fashion boot but meant for use in bad weather, but not ugly and not bulky."
2,Not exactly for 8-year-olds!,"My little sister got the Model Horse Activity Kit for Christmas. And it's not exactly for 8-year-olds like it says on the box. My sister's finished horses didn't look very good, and I offered to paint one of them over. After trying this, I now don't blame her at all for doing a slightly messy job. The paint is very difficult to work with, plus it's still sticky days after it is painted. But it might be better for older kids with a steady hand."
5,This chai latte is excellent. Better than DD.,"This is the best prepackaged chai latte I've ever tasted. And yes, better than Dunkin's. I found it a few years back and was bummed last year when it was no longer available at ANY of the stores in my area. I was very happy to see it on Amazon, at a fairly reasonable price, and snatched up two cases.Ahhh... just as I remembered."
4,Great for the price. Small and Sturdy.,"Bought this for our nursery. Doesn't take up much wall space, but holds a lot of children's books.Beware that very large books do not fit though.Took about 15 minutes to put together.Very handy size to use anywhere! Although the wood is not pine, it matches our natural finish pine crib very well."
2,this bookshelf is too small for big books,"This bookshelf looks good but too small for big books, and the space on each level is so small, that most of books can't fit in completely."
5,Sturdy and Easy to Assemble,"Very satisfied; it had space for all my dictionaries, and the upper shelf is very convenient"
5,Still wonderful after 25 years,"A decade before his celebrated work with African and Brazilian musicians, Paul Simon made this superb foray into the world of ""cool"" jazz. Musically tight, and containing some of his most trenchant and concise lyrics, this album stands as a masterpiece nearly a quarter century later."
5,Excellent documentary film,"I highly recommend this film. It is very well made and does an excellent job of documenting the state of the blues in the US in the early 1970s. Footage of Junior Wells and Buddy Guy opens the film. Also some excellent footage of Arthur Big Boy Cruddup. Somewhat humorously the European film makers thought his song was called ""Chain and Lock on the Door"" when it is really ""Changed the Lock on the Door."" Had I not known better (due to hearing other versions) I would easily have made the same mistake. Too bad more documentarians were not interested in chronicaling the vital music at the time. Other featured artists include Brownie McGhee & Sonny Terry and Mance Lipscombe."
4,"If you like Asian women, this is a good DVD for you.","This is a pretty good video. There are 3 dance sequences and a fire show which are worth the price of admission alone.It could be a lot better; the guy who edited it is ""fade happy"". Somebody needs to tell the guy that you don't need to do a stupid fade for everything. I also question the need to leave that G-String show after only a couple minutes.The other parts...the picture show would be a lot better without...more fades and stupid camera affects, but the women are hot. They also do a questionable job on the models segment, not all that ""hot"". Despite those problems, this is really a great video if you appreciate Asian women.Oh, there's also some breakdancing (guys) and some drifting which is kind of cool, but next time cut that and add more dancing girls!"
3,Good,"1987 release was the least sucsessful Sabbath record up till that point (in terms of sales. This information is written in the booklet of the remastered edition. The band was Iommi and a bunch of other guys. Of course this characterizes this effort a solo or project album. But the name Sabbath was too srong a seller and the record company would not allow it to be a solo project. Iommi has been ridularized for carrying the Sabbath flag when the band had no mor eidendity. I thin people are right. Iommi could certainly form a new band soon after Born Again, instead of releasing ""SEVENTH STAR - BLACK SABBATH FEATURING TONY IOMMI"". SEVENTH STAR alone would have been a good debut, but, as we all know, ti was an awful SABBATH album..."
3,Black Sabbath - 'The Eternal Idol' (Warner Bros.),"Band's 13th studio album. A so-so late '80's effort by Black Sabbath, certainly nothing to get too stoked about. Tunes here that I thought were 'okay' include ""The Shining"", ""Hard Life To Live"", maybe ""Scarlet Pimpernel"", the rocking ""Lost Forever"" and the semi-awesome title cut ""The Eternal Idol"". Line-up for this CD: Tony Martin-vocals, Tony Iommi-guitar, Bob Daisley (Ozzy, Uriah Heep, Rainbow)-bass and Eric Singer (Kiss, Alice Cooper)-drums. I'm giving this disc a three star rating pretty much for effort."
5,Good value for the price!,"Wow! This float was actually BETTER than I expected it to be! VERY durable. Very inexpensive! Great value for the price! Got some great color this summer and it is super comfortable! And, you get built-in cupholders, lol! :)"
1,I am giving it two stars because some parts were good,"I really enjoyed NY, wasn't too thrilled about London, figured Sarum was a prequel and it had a lot of 4 stars.The beginning of the book pulls you in, and than the building of stonehege was just ridiculous. I never knew a stone mason built stonehedge :) Anyway, I continued on, the characters, just like in his London book, were confusing. At the end I skipped the last 100 years and read the last few chapters."
3,"Not a magnificent, but an original book","Definetely NOT the best historical fiction I've ever read, but the book with a difference - it almost does not contain descriptions of events that changed the country, except for the main guidelines. They serve as a background for tracing destinies of 4 common families, back from the pre-historical mists till modernity. As you won't find here no heart-wrenching love stories, nor portraits of great historical persons, it might seem boring (and I was often lost in the debris of family trees of the main characters), and it often is. But after I have finished the book (it took me a couple of weeks), I felt a little sad, for human generations stem from immemorial times and generations ceaselessly go on, even if we, people of modernity, sometimes forget about it... Read the book, if you are in a philosophical or contemplative mood..."
4,Sarum: a magnum opus,"Sarum tells 6000 years of English history by fictionalizing the daily life of people living on the Salisbury Plain. I especially liked the chapters on the formation of the English Channel and the building of Stonehenge. I found most of Sarum very engaging, even though I am not a history buff."
5,Westerberg's Magnum Opus,I still remember listening to the album on CD when it came out.... Mars' playful rimshot at the end of IOU pretty much set the tone... maximum abuse of the best digital technology. Westerberg was able to do more with less than anybody since. The 'Mats Magnum Opus.
5,Best band of the '80s,"Sorry U2 and REM fans - The 'Mats WERE rock and roll in the Eighties: they wrote the best songs, played the best live shows and influenced the most fellow musicians. If you are new to The Replacements, this CD is the best place to start."
5,I.O.U. NOTHING,"""The words I thought I brought I left behind, so never mind...All over but the shouting, just a waste of time. So never mind.""--Never Mind This is just one of the lyrical gems on this album...can't help but think that Kurt Cobain thought so, too. I am always at a loss to pick my favorite Replacements album...its like ""Sophie's Choice."" Without Bob Stinson, this album has a more refined sound (there is even a horn section on Can't Hardly Wait!) but the attitude (bad) is still there. I have always felt that Can't Hardly Wait was the follow-up of Let It Be's Answering Machine. ""I'll be home when I'm sleeping, I can't hardly wait""--how romantic is that? And Valentine: ""Tonight makes love to all your kind, tomorrow picking valentines."" You can just hear that girl's heart breaking. There's more..suicide (The Ledge), feeling old (Nightclub Jitters), idol worship (Alex Chilton), love unrequited (Skyway), Whatever, never mind."
5,a timeless american '80s rock album,"say what you will, but this album was glued to my car's stereo for years ... although i have moved on, ""pleased to meet me"" is the soundtrack to my college years. it was and still is that inspirational !!!"
4,"good, but old","I first heard of this book when Katz was on the Daily Show. It's a funny book, but some entries just make you want to groan sometimes. Definitely a good light-hearted read to waste a Sunday afternoon."
4,THEY HAVE FILTERS ON AMAZON - TRY QUIET BOTTLES,"In answer to the question on filters - do a search on Amazonfor vernado humidifier, and you will see the wicks for sale.Also, I emailed the company, and they say only some bottles makea lot of noise. I have made suggestions, but one could tryusing a belt around the outside to squeeze the tanks in tight sothe plastic might be kept from making so much noise. Like abelt for clamping or moving, or a bungie, etc. There are alsolight gray bottles that go on both sides, if you don't likethe green.Later...Well, I tried other bottles, and it still glugs. I decided to keep it, anyway. I had tried 3 other manufacturers before this one. You can use this one in summer for air conditioning as well as winter, since it's not hot. Buy a humidistat (combined with thermometer) from Amazon, K-Mart, or Wal-Mart to see if you have a humidity problem, and how bad."
1,didn't fit despite being same size I wear now,"Despite the fact I am currently wearing this same model and size, the shoe did not come even close to fitting. Item was returned."
3,An OK album,"Atlantic Starr had their first Top 20 hits in 1985 with IF YOUR HEART ISN'T IN IT and SECRET LOVERS. The only Top 20 hit from this album,released two years later,is ALWAYS. That's a wedding/prom song. In the video,there's a couple in a church about to be pronounced husband and wife. The setting was ideal for that video. I sang some of those lyrics to my online girlfriend and she appreciated it. I think of her when I hear that song played over the satellite feed at my workplace. If I don't cry,I frown because it reminds me of one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life. Not going to the senior prom. That's a regret that will forever haunt me. I wouldn't want to hear ALWAYS without slow-dancing to it with my girl. All the other songs are good."
2,Written by a haughty affluent - not for me,"Honestly, this was the first book I read when we found out about our son. There are some good things in it to prep new parents about troubles, doubt, and other problems to expect that I found helpful. But, wow - she's so privileged, so wealthy and connected, I couldn't relate to anything else she wrote. Who has a nanny for 1-2 kids, when she doesn't work? And I don't know how truthful she is because she doesn't even use her own name. For any/all parents new to autism, or those just looking for hope and someone whose story you can relate to - I'd recommend Child's Journey Out of Autism by Whiffen - written much better, and by an average person that any father, mother, family member or friend can really relate to. That's the one to buy and share around. This one, and the other written by the celebrity, are like glancing at an Esquire magazine on the grocery shelf."
4,Intersting,Maurice enlightens the mind to the real world. The struggles that her family endured to help their children and the future of autism on research development. She writes this from the time when blame was placed upon the mother. She tells how she dealt with her emotions of that blame. This is an excellent book for a parent of a child with autism or an educator alike.
3,good for diagnosis shock but it is self indulgent...,"This was the first book I read after my son was diagnosed with autism. In some ways it really helped to get over the initial trauma of the diagnosis and to get down to business with an applied behaviour analysis program from my son. The author's narrative is frequently whiney and self-focused. Even her ""triumph over autism"" is misleading for parents with autistic children. Children 'are' autistic it isn't something they 'have' or 'can recover from'. The author's narrative seems to need the reader to know that she really is a perfect mother after all.It is a worthwhile book but it requires an awfully large grain of salt to go with it."
3,For Well Heeled - Well Connected Parents,"A well-written heart-gripping story for well heeled and well connected parents of autistic children. The book is about a family who could afford the best nannies, tutors, teachers, doctors, programs etc. Most parents lack the finances and sophistication of the author.Maurice`s book fails to address important issues that most parents must deal with, Special Education in Public Schools, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which is the federal law protecting autistic and other disabled child. Most importantly, the book ignores the Individualized Education Program or IEP and how a parent can work within the public school system to education their child.If you are a parent of an autistic child, this should NOT be the first book you read. ""Behavioral Intervention for Young Children with Autism,"" which the author edited is a much better choice, if you are looking for help.This is not a self-help book."
4,Good Read but not Heitzmann's best,"Let me first preface this with the note that I read the entire book in the loadtimes of playing a video game and in the 1 minute b/f my computer gets up and running. That scattered bit reading might have something to do with my blah feeling of the book overall.There is very little action, hardly any suspense, though those are balanced by a few good twists.The romance is blah, the characters are fine...semi annoying but fine.She's a good writer, great even, but some of the dialogue had the distinctly ""eh-that was dumb"" feel to it.Is it a worthwhile buy? Depends on your tastes.Is it a worthwhile read? Yes, if you like the slow, meandering type romances."
5,Amazing Story!,"Kristen Heitzmann did not disappoint. This is another intriguing and romantic novel. It has twists you don't see coming! I highly recommend this book if you like mystery and light romance all in one!Heitzmann's ability to introduce you to the characters and her description of details makes you feel you are right there.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Bethany House Publishers. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255 : ""Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."""
4,Emotionally charged,"I found this book on Amazon for my mother, since she had read the book that followed this one, In the Still of the Night. It helped her understand the second book's characters and events surrounding their lives. The story revolved around three men and one woman who only wanted to paint and be left alone. Although she came from money, she was very talented and sensitive; her father had lost himself in his work after his wife died. The trauma that happened at a very early age shadowed her relationships and almost destroyed her. The two brothers were both interested in this beautiful woman, although one was bolder in his approach and confidence. It was a deep and moving story about poor choices people make in their lives, and finding a source to hold on to during the difficult times of life."
2,Couldn't do it,"I bought this stuff based on all of the 5 star reviews. I am giving it 2 stars just because of the nutrition facts and ingredients list... but otherwise I would only give it 1. While I don't mind the cinnamon taste, I can't stand the texture. I've mixed it with many different liquids (including water) and the thickness is out of control. It reaches almost a gelatinous state, which makes me gag. If you have a strong stomach, this is a great product for you, otherwise, look elsewhere."
4,"Quick, easy, tasty way to get fiber","I bought a container of this product a few weeks back as a way to bulk up my protein shakes and get extra fiber into my diet. Since then, I've also been using it with oatmeal. I will warn you though: the fiber soaks up a lot of water so don't be afraid to add extra water to your hot cereal after you stir this in. I am anxious to try it in baked goods next, but have the same concern about how much more liquid I'd need to add to keep from making tasty hockey pucks."
5,Diving into DVD production without drowning.,"Overview: Serious material presented with a sense of humor. Highlights many details critical to successful video production that are hard to find elsewhere. Blends technical knowledge with artistic sensibilities. Answers the questions you wouldn't otherwise even know to ask. Easy to read, easy to understand, easy to translate into practice. Good exposure (pun intended) to the many issues facing the DV storyteller."
3,Somewhat disappointing,It was almost 4 star worthy but..It wasn't what you envisioned when you heard this trilogy was coming out. It took me awhile to get into it & it was a little predictable. It did gain steam as it went on & the sly deceptions of Fistdantilus made up for its shortcomings.
2,Pass the cheese please!,"The well known ""bad movie"" Plan 9 has nothing on this movie for cheesy camp. We have it all here folks, VERY bad acting, ultra cheap sets, corny story line, and to top it off John Carradine appearing as a face only and spouting off some bombastic soliloquy for several minutes non stop. Get it, watch it late on a Friday night whilest you enjoy some hot buttered popcorn and sip away on an ice cold, real glass bottle of Coca-cola. You'll love it and have a good laugh, I know I did."
3,not good,I bought a set of Jassen's narrated c.d.s from EBay. Generally a waste of money. I hope on this C.D. Jassen Bowman has developed better speaking style.
4,Important,"This book needed to be written. Come on, someone had to be honest about children. Way too many young women like me will not know what they are getting into unless they read this book. If you read this book and you still want to have kids, you are ready and will make a good parent! If not, like she says, leave your mark by being a blessing to other people who are already alive."
4,Disturbingly honest,"I think this book should be required reading for high school sex education classes and for anyone who is *consciously* deciding whether to become a parent or not. Too many times this momentous, life-chaging decision is based on romanticized ideals of parenthood or on society's expectations (or even by accident!), and not enough time is spent in researching what it's *really* like. Far from being a parent-bashing book, it highlights the not-so-wonderful parts of the job and provides a much-needed balance to the soft-focused, Kodak moment images that are held up to us as the ideal. I've chosen not to have kids: this book details many of the reasons why I've made this very personal choice. And a possible side effect: you may feel an urge to call your own parents and thank them for putting up with you while you were growing up -- at least that's what I did!"
2,it was ok but not as god as the wayans can come.,"kinda corny but does have a few laughs just not enough for me. it cannot compare to im gonna git you sucka, dont be a menace, scary movie or white chicks."
4,Spoof On,"The Wayans family is to comedy what the Jackson family is to music, they are legendary and have truly paved the way for alot of the stuff thats out today. I like the movie because the humor was relatable, at times some of the jokes slipped passed and you had to rewind it because you were so busy laughing at the previous scene. I got this movie expecting some corny lines and characters and within the first 10 minutes I was proven wrong.It has some sappy parts like every movie does, but they love to make fun of life and stereotypes. It was also very fun to try and figure out who was family and who was not ..this film is flooded with wayans blood and its great how the family keeps up laughs. I recommend this flick."
1,DO NOT BUY,"An absolute joke. The book is in no way representative of the CSET Foundational Level math exams, 110 and 111. The fact that the book contains so many errors alongside graphics that look as if they were created on a Commodor 64 should have tipped me off. This review is your tip off."
1,Sticks to tables- permanently,"Well, I should have listened to the other reviewer. This product is crap. The placemat tears easily (just like the bib) and the adhesive is unforgiving. I had to apologize to the owner of a restaurant because I couldn't get all the glue off his wooden table."
5,Beautiful Set,"I received two of theses and am very happy with them. One thing to know is that the dishes are actually textured, which you cannot tell from the pictures. It as if a translucent glaze has been put over the cherry blossom pattern, making the surface textured and giving a muted quality to the design, which is very pretty. It is a beautiful set and great quality. It also comes a nice packaged gift set to give as a gift. I have already used them and the soy sauce did not discolor the glaze, unlike other pottery."
4,Any of Margaret Maron's Books,All of the Deborah Knott Mysteries are wonderful! I have read them all and none disappointed me. I highly recommend.
2,Had trouble staying interested,"This is the first book by Margaret Maron I have listened to, and it will be thelast. It was not interesting enough to keep my attention. The amazon reviewsays the author is going for local color, but the way it was presented did notinterest me. If you want mysteries with local color, I suggest the BrotherCadfael books by Ellis Peters or the Amelia Peabody books by Elizabeth Peters.I would also suggest Josephine Tey. Her book The Daughter Of Time is number oneon The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time, a list made in 1990 by theBritish-based Crime Writers' Association."
1,I can't believe I finished it...,"I bought this book b/c I heard it had been made into a movie (although I have not seen it, and don't plan on it) and figured it would be a good read. I was wrong.The characters are poorly developed and I didn't see how any of them formed a bond or connection in any way. There is very little ~ if any ~ detailed description of places, events, or conditions. Hardly anything was established, the plot seemed to jump around from chapter-to-chapter and the main idea of the book seemed to be lost. I would bet there are 1,000 books out there that do this storyline justice, but this isn't one of them.Poorly written, not very well developed, and not written like somebody who has done their research."
2,beginner baker,"I love to bake bread, but where I'm from, they do not sell fresh yeast. That makes using this book very challenging. His directions for substituting instant yeast is not clear. The bread that I tried making from here was a failure. However, the book does have many traditional breads that seem really nice. Would have been better if the author did consider readers who are not able to get hold of fresh yeast."
4,Good for the little ones,I bought this for my 3.5 month old baby. He seems to like it very much since we introduced it to him. The colors are very attractive but the rattle noise is very low. He seems very interested in using it to practice his two-handed grabbing skill and also to practice passing it from one hand to the other. I am not very sure about the longevity of this toy in terms of how long will my baby will be interested in it but for now it seems great.
3,not interesting to my girl,"We got this for my baby at around 6 months, and she has showed no interest in this. She is about 7.5 months now and still has no interest. As everyone knows, every baby is different."
3,Boring but safe,"I bought this (with a gift card--I might not have paid the price otherwise), but my kid never took to this toy and consistently refused it when teething in favor of water-filled teethers. It still looks like something that ought to appeal to a baby or toddler, but it was a total failure for us. The main point in its favor is safety. Your small baby won't clock herself the way she could with a wooden rattle or other hard toy, and there's no suffocation potential like you might have with a soft toy. Your toddler won't break a window or clock someone else if he likes it enough to throw it around. Of course, if your child has no interest in it at all, that doesn't matter anyway.It can be hung from a stroller or bouncy seat with links, but it's too big for that to work out well. We bought this when our kid was less than 2 months old, and at no point in the baby or toddler stage was it a success. Maybe when the baby teeth fall out and the grown-up ones are coming in??"
2,Appeals to parents more than their kids,"I loved the way this looked and felt, and it seemed sturdy and well made (which it is). But my son had less than zero interest in it. Although it was easy to grasp, it was hard for my son to get in his mouth (which is pretty much the point of any toy or teether for him). Once he found he couldn't get it in his mouth, he tossed it aside, and has not glanced at it since."
2,Son doesn't care for it,"This was one of the first items we were given when we found out I was expecting. I was excited to receive it as I thought it would be a great toy. It was colorful, easy to grasp, light-weight, and made noise. Well, my son is now almost 7 months, and although we introduced it early and it gets regular rotation, he never has any interest in playing with it for more than about 10 seconds."
5,great toy for the grabby baby,"Friends of ours had this toy for their wee one, and our 6 month old couldn't keep her thieving paws and slobber off of it. So, we spoiled her with one. She loves it still after 25 years. Her college friends make fun of her."
4,Good but not a favorite,"My son got this for a gift when he was born. He began to hold it around 2-3 months. We always had it around for him to play with, but it was never his favorite. It is easy to hold and soft to chew on, and other parents who saw it went out and bought one immediately, so I definitely recommend it, but it just wasn't one of my son's favorites."
4,Keeps him interested,"I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old and he plays with it all the time. He's now about 6 months and not bored with it. The rattle, bright colors, graspable pieces, and mouth-friendliness make this a winner for him. Other babies have tried to steal it from him at play groups, so I guess that's a good sign too."
5,My baby loves it!,My daughter is almost 4 months old and she loves it. she grabs it with both hands (sort of) and takes it to her mouth to lick it and then grunts when she drops it. it's her favorite!
3,eeehhhh.....,"I was super excited about this toy. My little guy loves to put things in his mouth, but at 4 months, sometimes has trouble getting what he wants in his mouth. I thought this would be perfect because no matter where you bite it, there is something soft to chew on. This turned out to be only sort of true. I thought the little rings (or whatever you call them) would be a lot softer. Instead it is sort of hard. They bend of course, but just not as soft as I thought they would be. I bought this and a freddie the firefly (by lamaze)Lamaze Freddie the Firefly, Colors May Varythe same time and my little guy would choose freddie every time over this. I think it's really cool looking and a clever idea...but I'm not the one is supposed to be entertained by it. :)"
4,"Nice Toy, but like any toy it may or may not be your kids favorite","Its a bit small, but its pretty cool! Not my sons favorite but he may be a bit young. It is robust and has been thrown across the room and its still in perfect shape."
3,The Winkel,"My baby is 6 months old and I bought this toy for him to use as a teether. He loves just holding it because it fits his tiny hands. He likes to shake it (it is also a rattle). I found out that he likes playing with it during bath time. Other than that, he is not very into it. The Winkel is not a ""must have"" toy."
5,Great toy with extended use.,"It's hard to find toys that infants through toddlers enjoy. This is one of the items I purchased for use at my child care center and is probably one of the simplest and most used. Small infants can grasp it with problem and older infants through toddlerhood use it almost like a ball. It's brightly colored, holds up well to extended use, super easy to clean, and has a wide range of age interaction... and isn't over priced."
5,Good for chewing and little hands,"The Winkel has sound, bright color and chew-ability, plus its design allows for little hands to get a good grip, Great toy for a teething babe."
5,Amazing fun toy!!,"My 1 year old loves this toy! It is easy to pick up, it is fun to shake, and he loves how it bounces when he throws it. It is soft enough to not hurt anything or anyone when tossed, but strong enough to be pulled and chewed on without being damaged. Of course, once he's older, I'll also be able to explain how the loops look just like magnetic field lines!,"
3,just toy!!,"soft material of its out.maybe it's a silicon~~ maybe, i didn't read that's using message.and, my baby use very usually~"
5,GREAT for little hands.,"I bought this after seeing a 6 week old playing with one at my post-partum yoga class. I was like, ""My 6 week old can't grab nuthin'... :( "" Well, that was because I didn't have any toys good for teeny tiny hands. I don't think a little baby could *not* grab this toy - where ever their little fingers go, there is a perfectly-sized tube to grab. The rattle is a very nice touch. Now, at 6 months old, he still plays with this, but not as much as when he was even smaller (I'm thinking because he has more options now). The little tubes are also great fun for him to chew on. I recommend this for EVERYONE with a little new baby. I had bought all kinds of rattles and baby toys, which he eventually grew into - but this was the early toy that he was really able to interact with."
5,manhattan toy winkel,"this toy is very well made, and my 7 month old loves all the different spots he can grab and hold on to."
5,Great toy for little hands.,My daughter is a preemie and has a hard time grabbing toys because they are too heavy and large for her. This toy is great because she can easily grab it and chew on it. She is 4 months old and this is her favorite toy right now.
2,ok toy,This toy has bright colors which my 9 month old son likes but he's shown no interest in this toy.
5,Every baby should have one of these!,"This is by far the best toy I found for our son. The many loops help develop hand coordination and using both hands to bring the toy to midline. It is easy for them to grab and light enough where they can play with in on their backs or tummy. It can also be placed in the fridge and then be used as a teether. While we don't do that, our some is always chewing on it and it is the best teether toy we found for him. I was put off a bit by the price but it is well worth it. Every baby should have one!"
1,Baby didn't connect with the toy,"Got this for baby when he was 6 months old - he tried it and put it aside. He's 20 months now, still not playing with it."
1,Upset about this purchase,"After purchasing this product for my son, I was really upset when it arrived, WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET! It is useless and over-priced... I should have gotten something else! Never again! I won't recommend this buying this toy to anyone..."
4,Loves it!,This toy was one of the first toys that my daughter paid much attention to. At 7 months she is still very into it. It is good for teething babies. She likes to chew on it and whack it on the floor or whatever surface is nearby. It makes a rattling noise.
4,Great book,"This is a wonderful book. It goes through the seasons of the year with the apple tree. There are large illustrations on each page, along with a sentence or two of text. This book is great for those wishing to learn about seasons of the year and also about phases of an apple tree (from buds to blossoms to apples to bare branches and back to buds again). Although I wish that the text had some rhyme or cadence to it, its still a very good book that my daughter asks to have read to her again and again."
5,FINALLY QUALITY MUSIC!,"Wow, being a DJ and a producer I have heard a lot of music good and bad. To tell you the truth I haven't been impressed with anything in the past couple of years. The Bedrock label has changed my mind. I believe that Digweed is the finder of true talent. DJ Hyper was voted the 2nd best breaks DJ in the UK and in listening to this album I want to know why he wasn't 1st.The music is incredible, I believe that this DJ is one of the best I have ever heard. The mixing is smooth and the record choices are all incredible. Every song - even if you are a raver, DJ, or just a person that just likes eletronic music captures the true quality of the undergroung scene. WOW - What elese can I say, and I never review anything. This is definatly one thats going down in the history books as one of the best albums of the 21st century I tell you."
1,lack of information,Was not compatible with my workstation. they should have a list of what's compatible and what isn't for us the customers. Had to return it and get my money back. but had to pay for shipping.
2,I really WANT to like it,"My 7 year old daughter loves this book. They read it at school often and she had to have it. I just can't get into it, at all. There is no story at all. It's just random words. I feel like it's a book version of modern art. With modern art they might just splash paint on canvas, here they just threw random words on the page. I hate that I don't like it, because she loves it so much. But I like progress, development and a story. I just write this for people who wonder about the ""story"" of it, which there is none. I am not trying to bash anyone that loves this book, I just want to voice how I feel it was written. Hope this helps someone!"
3,creepy,"I purchased this book for my son's first birtday based on so many high reviews. When the book arrived, and I was actually able to look at it first hand, I was disappointed. I want to love this book, I really do, but instead I find it somewhat creepy. I can't put my finger on what it is, but this book just kind of creeps me out. Needless to say, I decided to hold on to this book until my son is a little older. Maybe by then it will appeal to me more."
5,Rain Makes Applesauce,"This is a charming book for children to read. Its silly phrases and fantastic illustrations will keep children entertained for countless readings.It is a childhood favorite of mine, one I have shared with numerous students. ""Oh you're just talking silly talk,"" was a favorite saying from my childhood. Once I read this book to my students, they used the phrase too.I'm thrilled to see this book in print again!"
1,CPC 800 disappointment,Received mine from local dealer. The corrector plate was full of smudges in the inside. A replacement unit was quickly sent with a Celestron Quality Assurance certificate. This replacement unit has severe tracking problems. The objects are not kept centered in FOV. I'll not request for a third unit because I simply don't know if I can trust Celestron quality policy anymore.ProsOutstanding alignment systemConsTracking capabilities.Lack of quality control.
2,disappointing,"you think with this cast it would be funny. eh, not really. ted danson was off and it just wasnt that funny. i want my money back."
3,Appropriately Titled,"I expected quirky, funny, and interesting. I got quirky, sometimes funny, buy not very interesting. The guy is a pot smoking, heavy drinker who loses he girlfriend because he won't stop smoking pot and drinking! If I'd known that, I wouldn't have bought the series. The mysteries are interesting, but the path to solving them feels longer than the hour long episode. Overall, disappointing."
5,"Pure Brilliance... Subtle Comedy that Requires Attention, But Comes With Great Rewards","Bored to Death is a brilliant show, if you are even on the fence about checking this out then you are who this show was aimed at, I was intrigued with this show for a while until one day I just decided to watch it and was instantly hooked. Once you ""get"" Bored to Death you will realize just how brilliant the writing is, each episode is a 30 minute ride that develops its characters and continues the overall story's arch while featuring smart comedy. Some of the funny parts are so subtle though that if you are not focused on the show you will surely miss, but not to worry there is still comedic situations that anyone will get. It is hard to describe this show since it is smart and rewards it viewers, needless to say though this is top-notch television that features great writing, acting (Ted Danson is awesome), comedic timing and directing, it at least deserves a viewing."
5,In the heart of the fans,"I loved Deadman's last album, Paramour. Blue River and Down by the Winedale are two of my favorites. I was really hoping that this new album would live up to the last one...and it did!!Deadman has a beautiful way of weaving stories into their music. Their sound is smart and refreshing.Take the time and listen to Sad Ole' Geronimo and When the Music's Not Forgotten off their new album. I promise, if your not a Deadman fan now you soon will be!!"
4,beautifully crafted pop,"Recent reviewer Marvin Van Pelt (related to Lucy, perhaps?) is apparently one bitter, unhappy guy. He's from Texas, as is Andrea Perry - did she jilt him in high school? We'll never know. At any rate, I'm at a loss to understand what's wrong with esteeming Paul McCartney, Brian Wilson, and Burt Bacharach as your forebears. This is a lovely record, with sometimes dark lyrical concerns wrapped in a deceptively chipper, spun-sugar cocoon of catchy melodies and immaculate presentation. As a musician, Perry isn't dazzling - but instrumental virtuosity and great pop are usually antithetical concepts; as a producer, she shines, and so does this record."
4,giggles and grins,"I've read the Amelia Peabody series with tremendous enjoyment, and just happened to see this title; it caught my attention due to the locale of the story (I love the southwest) and I was looking for a light read. I love it! Just what I needed as a break from my studies - it's light and fun, as I giggle and grin throughout the first four chapters (which is as far as I've gotten). Thank you, Elizabeth!!!!"
1,Poor Quality Connectors,"This cable was, I thought, exactly what I needed. The breakout wires are about 6 inches and just what I needed as I'm feeding these through a small hole in the wall. regular size audio cables would not have fit and would be too rigid ( for my arrangement )Anway, the problem is that the connectors are so cheaply made that they almost fall off! Just not a good solid connection. I tried squeezing the rings but they are just so thin that it hardly helped. I'm wondering how the signal pin is making contact?You've all seen the quality of those throw in RCA cables you get when you buy a cheap DVD player etc. Well those are 100% better than these cables. Made in China says it all..........Don't buy !!!"
2,Complicated.,"Not a good trivia game, hard for kids to read cards. the acting out part is too difficult and the game takes forever."
3,Average CD,"Luis Miguel has one of the best voices in the Latino market. But that doesn't make it a good cd every time he makes one. His up tempo songs like his first single ""AMOR"" is like something you would expect from Neil Diamond or Barry Manillow cheesy songs from the 70's.Luis Miguel stengths are ballads and mariachis anything that is up tempo or with a beat, forget about it! This is an average cd that should sastify his hardcore fans but if he wants to bring new fans then this cd didn't cut it."
2,False advertising?,"I feel I was ripped off. I found this book completely useless. It is obviously aimed to Christians only, because the ""Timeless Wisdom and Foolproof Strategies"" refer to Christian based advice which is just common sense. The religious aspect was never mentioned once in the description. I don't have any problem with religion except when people lie about it or hide it."
3,"Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind.","During the glorious cultural revolution of the '60's and '70's, the philosophers of Ms Borsook's generation told us to distrust the government, question authority, and do what felt good. Now the social engineers are hoisted with their own petard: We distrust the government, we question authority, and we're doing what feels good -- i.e. making pig-loads of money. Ms Borsook has no right to complain."
5,Merchant Marine Remembered,"Bunker provides a valuable insight to the USMM in World War II. The book is wonderful to read and feels as if you are there. Bunker also gives important insight to less remembered theatres of war like the Indian Ocean and Caribbean. The only possible error I found was the number of the U-Boat that sunk the USAT Dorchester I believe it was U-223, although I could be wrong. VERY WELL written book. Kudos to John Bunker."
1,A desperate search for a plot!,"This is the first book I've read by this author and it will be quite a stretch to get me to read another. Only through sheer willpower did I convince myself to read halfway through this text in desperate search for a plot. The plot finally started to reveal itself, but it was so weak, I couldn't believe anyone would use it as the basis for a novel. I've got to confess - I never finished the book. I NEVER quit midstream in a book (I attacked Moby Dick three times before finishing it!), but I finally conceded that I had better uses for my time than trying to plod through the rest of this weak effort."
3,"Great look, to bad it didn't last long","Bought this for my wife, installed it. It looks great and performed well until either the sun or internal light melted/deteriorated the semi-transparent button. The frog doorbell lasted about 6months before I replaced it with a LED type of door bell. I wish I could put the led bulb components on the frog door bell. My wife really liked the frog hanging near the front door."
2,A big disappointment.,"I had hoped this book would deliver. Destiny and the meaning of life are serious topics. I looked forward to reading how Howe would treat it in a light manner. But as I read, I found myself telling the author, ""Would you mind getting your finger out of my face!"" She never allowed the reader to think for himself."
3,A mostly likeable book; but...,"...the author regretably allowed her political leanings to intrude. The preaching on gun control and socialized medicine marred an otherwise amusing and, at times, charming story.One other criticism; I'm sure most readers will recognize the implausibility of the protagonist's classmates' responses to his decision to change his name to ""Blue Avenger"" and even to wear a costume to school. Sorry, but that would just be begging for ridicule, if not outright tormenting from other kids."
3,Nice pictures. Limited information,Interesting brief storylines on various historic ocean liners. Good pictures. Wish the book had included more information and gone to greater depths (pun intended) as it left the reader wishing for more. Much of the information written was not new.
4,"Fun for a while, but definitely not deep","This game plays well for the first few hours, but after a while, you may get bored simply because the only incentive for you to keep playing is to unlock new trucks and courses. There is no story or career mode, although it keeps a small number of stats for you. The long-term appeal of this game does not exist since there is no online play. Two-player mode gets boring as well since there are only two cars and no CPU bots. I recommend as a rental first."
4,a must have,Excite truck is unbelievably fun! The people who ranked it lower than a 4 star must be serious gamers (ie they only play serious games) ... this game is all about fun. Yes you disobey the laws of physics when you turn in the air and the ground does morph right under your wheels.... this game was not designed to be a model of the real world....IT'S A GAME! And it is a complete blast! The only complaints I have are I want stars for how many coconuts fall off the trees when I ram into them and I would like stars for the amount of time I actually spend on the trail... not a lot of stars for the latter though as it is fun doing the 5 star tree runs... oh one more complaint... my right thumb is sore... HA!!!
3,Much of it is a rehash of his other books,"There are some good ideas in the book, but I've a few issues with it:- There are very few practical tips on finance and money management- Many of the chapters are just a rehash of chapters in his other book ""Don't sweat the small stuff about work""- Some chapters say the same thing about wisdom, just in a different way i.e. Chapters 14, 26, 31, 35, 38, 42, 43, 44 and 45 all pretty much say the same thing: ""quiet down your mind, pay attention to your inner wisdom, and stop worrying"". It was very annoying reading chapter after chapter on the same theme with no new insights or practical tips- Many of the chapters are not about money at all, they are about a mindset. And then Carlsson tags on to the end of the chapter something like, ""and with this mentality, you will have more abundance"".My advice: 1) Get instead ""Don't sweat the small stuff about work"" and then 2) Get a better book on managing your finances"
3,Listen to it before you buy it,"Yes Ronnie James Dio has the golden voice of heavy metal and in no way is he a clown. Dream Evil is a fair production nothing really blazes on this cd, it took me a while to get used to it, Night people is a good song, the title track is o.k, and all the fools sailed away is probaly the best song. Other than that the lyrics are corny and so is the guitar playing. Hear this album before you buy it, it is in no way as good as The Last In Line or The Mob Rules."
3,Good Effort-Dio Stares in the Face of a Lineup Shift,"This is the first Dio's first album without Vivian Campbell, and a pretty good one at that. Craig Goldy proves he can hold his own in Dio's strange musical landscapes through a series of tough, crunchy riffs and solos (just check out the intersting riff on the album's title song).As far as the rest of the album goes, everything is pretty average. The band still is exploring the same musical themes that it had on previous efforts, creating a somewhat standard (but still entertaining) metal album."
4,Length does matter.,Got the 24 ft ball retriever. We had one before but it broke after 6 years of use. The catcher end is easy: you drop it just past the ball and pull towards you. The ball locks in place as you bring it ashore.The longer the better.
2,Plain bad,"If you want a good tailgating book try ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" the recipes are fabulous. A real cajun chef did em. This is not worth it. I too found it to have an Ole Miss slant. Ole Miss?"
5,Great,I ordered this book on a sunday and I recieved it on Friday...And the book was as described...no complaints
2,Good for amateurs,"If you are a person that loves those ""Dummies"" book (I am not one of those people) then you might enjoy this book. It goes through one tutorial at a very slow pace with lots of pictures in a very general fashion. It tells you to do certain things, generalizes why and what you are doing, and then doesn't go into any more specifics. This book is mainly for novices and ""slower"" learning people. If you want to become very proficient in 3ds max and are a quick learner then I would recommend a different book.DWP"
2,"Good, but Pompous","Seemed interesting at the beginning, but after four chapters, I couldn't take the constant boasting anymore, and never finished it. I just got done reading Conrad Hilton's 'Be My Guest', and that book was riveting without all the bragging.I've always admired Sumner Redstone from afar until I started to read this book."
5,Claifornia Indian Languages,Amazon service was excellent as expected. I bought this book as a gift for a museum docent. It was much appreciated and will no doubt add to his already considerable knowledge of California's indigenous people.
1,Complete waste of time,"I can'nt say more that there is no value in this Audio. Complete waste of time. The style of the author seems to all over the map where he seems to be suggesting techniques with a ""whatever sticks on the wall"" approach. Very in coherent and boring. Do yourself a favor and do not waste time with this book."
2,So-So information,"First of all, it does not seem possible to change anybody, especially when one does not believe they need to change. This book gives techniques and examples that we all are able to relate to someone we know, but those techniques don't work on everybody. The advice and techniques are not earth-shattering and certainly don't work in every situation. If you're buying this book for a quick fix; good luck."
2,Worst one to date,"This was Marty's worst album to date. Certainly better than most of what Nashville has produced recently...but not up to Marty Stuart's standards. Marty can do better, and he has."
2,Not a Kripalu Yoga Expereince,"In my experience and opinion, the tone, languaging and pacing of the CD is not aligned with Kripalu methodology or culture. To me, I got the unfortunate image of Ms. Voelker wearing a black leather leotard and practically barking orders as if speaking to juvenile delinquents, not aging baby boomer folks or those with chronic health conditions in need of a therapeutic relationship with their mind, body, heart and soul. (She says things about peace and love, but I hear rigidity and austerity.) There is no mention of 'breathe, relax, feel, observe and allow'. I feel that her pacing of the instructions are contraindicative to relaxation, digestion or assimilation of the proposed exercises and their benefits.As a Kripalu Yoga Teacher, I would not share this CD with any of my students or wish to be considered in alliance with Ms. Voelker's particular style of teaching."
1,Not exactly baking from scratch,"Anyone considering buying this book should be aware that a large number of its recipes call for prepared items such as cake mixes, 7up, canned chocolate syrup, canned frosting, canned pineapple and mandarin oranges, candy bars, frozen whipped topping, pudding mix, and prepared graham cracker pie crust."
5,Good Stuff,I take it daily for balance of clorestrol drugs. The enzimes that cause muscle pains from drugs like lipitor and crestor is offset with this supplement
4,ideal for small collection,this would be a 5 star item if the lock worked with the key provided !!An attractive and practicalway to keep and display a small collection of pocket watches or movements
5,This CD is a total knockout!,"This is one of the best jazzy-bluesy vocalists I've heard in a long time. Orah's voice is soft and sexy. The songs range from ballads to swinging chicago blues to sultry jazz. She is obviously a gifted songwriter as well. I recommend this CD highly to anyone who wants to ""get in the mood"". This is quite an impressive debut!"
4,George Siglar Writes Like a Pilot,"That Mr. Siglar is no great writer is the only reason the book doesn't get five stars from me. I can't help but believe the book would have been a significanlty better read if he had written the book sooner than 26 years after the event, but writing to one side, the book still contains some very valuable information. It just isn't structured as well as I would have liked.However, any student of sea survival should definitely read about George and Charlie's experience sailing a ZODIAC boat (Its unfair to call it a Raft) across the pacific with nothing more than a survival kit prepared by Mr. Siglar. No food (really) no water, just the kit. There is nothing like first hand accounts to inform students of the realities of any situation, and Siglars account (like Steve Callahan's Adrift) is full of the things you never think about unless you've been there.My advise, pick one up."
2,Battery scam,"Don't buy APC. They need to learn to stop the battery scam they are running. Batteries don't cost that much. Oh but they'll tell you to upgrade instead. SCAM! When this units battery goes bad, which is unusually quick, you cant use it anymore. Power does not pass through. No big deal if the batteries were priced correctly. Maybe they should visit the local hardware store. My weed whacker uses the same kind of battery. Ask any battery store. Not my word, theirs. Its a shame since the unit isn't that bad."
3,RS 800 Review,The good:This back up device works very well. It has the automatic shutdown software and data surge protection as well.The bad:I have 8 of these deployed in my office currently and within 2 years I have had to replace the batteries for every unit. Batteries will cost you about $70 shipped.
1,Product defective,"Just since this backup unit went online about 10 days ago, it has gone into ""catastrophic failure"" mode three times with nothing more than one desktop PC plugged into it. When it goes into this mode, all power to attached equipment is shut off. Plus, the computer that was attached was in sleep-mode when each of the failures occurred. Although the lights indicate that not only is the unit inoperable, but the battery is totally dead as well. However, turning it off and then back on resets everything and the self-test indicates everything is working fine. This is a defective unit."
2,Not in the Demographic,"If you are a Judd Apatow devotee, you will not be disappointed in this one. In fact, it's a slight notch above his usual mass media product. Having said that, I now understand that that I am not anywhere near the demographic for which this type of film was designed. That means that I find his high school and college comedies, etc. pretty unappealing, No doubt it's best if I avoid them in the future. And that's the plan."
2,OLDE REVIEW.La Bamba,"Sound track other than the primary cut, LaBamba .Did not seem the same as the movie.Would not recommened the sound track.Was purchased as a gift."
4,Good time rock 'n roll,"For the most part, this is a great soundtrack. The only problem I have with this, is that the ""La Bamba"" on the CD is not the exact one played in the movie during the concert and also at the end of the movie where the credits are. The one in the movie is SLIGHTLY faster and upbeat. Would have loved to have that version on the CD."
5,The best CD to have,I think the The Los Lobos did a great job doing the soundtrack to La Bamba because it brings back those old song back to life. This soundtrack is one of my best out all the CD's have. I think you'll have fun listing to this album.
5,La Bamba....,"Impressive and well recorded the sound is really good.This original picture soundtrack remember me a lot of souvenirs...every songs are really goodDonna, la bamba,and again it comes packed professionnaly and shipped really fastthanks to amazone.ca"
1,Never Give in - Except with this book!,"Churchill was an extraordinary character but this book does very little to increase our understanding of this statesman. The book is exhaustingly repetitive and is fatally flawed by the needlessly intrusive opinions of the authour. It is written in the style of someone who has little to say but wants to take all day to say it!The author's main premise is that Churchill's faith was at the centre of his greatness, this may or may not be true. At the end of the book I really didn't care.It has to be the worst book I've read this year, I would not recommend it."
4,"a few flaws,but still entertaininhg.","Of the four shows on this VHS cassette,the second and third shows featured,""Old Mail Day"" and ""Jealousy Engligh Style"" are,in my opinion,the best of the tape.They are on a par with the majority of shows that gave the ""Green Acres"" series its screwball-like,endearingly silly brand of comedy status.""Lisa Bakes a Cake,which opens the tape is reasinably funny and amusing but its ratherb unfocused direction and script keep it from really hitting tyhe bullseye of silliness that were characteristic of the series as a whole.The last episode,""Oliver goes broke""was made towards the end of the series run and the humor by this point had become sort of mechanical,forced and is certainly the wakest entry of the four.All in all,very amusing stroll down memory lane(as long as you be sure to fast forward the last episode I mentioned earlier)."
3,For the rank beginner - LIKE ME,"This is a good book for someone who has little or no knowledge of woodturning and wants to do some research... I really wish the section on lathe selection was better done, I really still have no idea of what lathe to look for for what I am mostly intetested in, bowl turning.The section on techniques is good, but extremely basic and I think needs a bit more clarification as to the tools used.. as does the sharpening area...All in all if you have no idea of woodturning, this will give you enough understanding to get a better book and know what it says.."
2,cobra walkietalkie,"Had problems with 1st one,sent back,defective. 2nd one just got back, problems with on/off switch,quality issues.Not very pleased."
2,Poor For Advanced Users,"I bought this book because it covered all the tools that I use for web development, hoping that it would give me further insight into developing with those tools. However because it covers such a vast array of subjects it only delves on the fundementals."
4,Not bad,"Not bad for the price, but I wish they had included a larger Phillips screwdriver point. This one is a little small for most sturdy applications. Ok for the price."
4,Great Set,"This is a good screwdriver set, and I like that it comes with it's own 'wall holder'. The only downside to this set is the wall mount plastic can get a little ....fatigued(?) and start to let go after not too long. So then you end up with 1/2 of your screwdrivers on the ground at random times (and then the kids get into them!).I would have made it 4.5 or 4.75 if I could have. The quality of the actual tools is just what you expect from Stanly! No complaints there!!!! The only reason I dropped it a star is the holder gets a little flimsy."
3,not good quality,"price is good, but quality is not so good, no good grip, would not buy this product again in future."
2,not fit the screws,"I purchased this set to take apart my child's Ds lite to replace the top screen. The tri wing worked, but the screwdriver did not fit the screws on the DS lite. I was unable to out her DS back together and had to purchase a new one."
1,Bad experience,"I have ordered Verizion Blackberry product on 03/19 and I got the Blackberry on 3/23. I have activated my Blackberry on 3/23, but Verizon started charging my service from 3/19 instead on 3/23. When I called Verizon, they said they cannot do anything because their system shows it is activated on 3/19. When I called Amazon, they said they cannot do anything.I won't suggest to order wireless product from Amazon because as soon as you order the charges will start before you get the wireless product.I am not happy after talking with Verizon customer service."
4,2nd in the series - a good read,"I enjoyed this book - it picked up some of the story line from the previous book, and enlarged upon the entire story! Very good condition, better than what was listed. I'd use this seller again."
5,Blink twice!,I love this book! Sooooo good that I'm going to go back and read it again!!!Ted Dekker is my new favorite author!
4,Interesting,"I found this book to be different that some of the other books I've read by Ted Dekker. Especially since there was no main killer, still villians, but not in the type of ""serial killer"" that seems to be prevalent in other books of his that I have read.I liked the main characters and the twists and turns this book took.Again, towards the end of the book it got a little on the long side and a bit boring, like you just wanted to get the book over with. Of course then when you are finished, you feel like you want to keep reading.Seems to happen with most of the Ted Dekker books I've read.Good mystery with lots of twists and turns.Also, not sure why but this book goes by different titles - like he wasn't sure what to call it at first, and the book jackets are always different."
4,Rivals Grisham in suspense and character development.,"Never heard of Ted Dekker? Neither had I until I read this suspense-filled story of a man, a latent genius who feels more than a little uncomfortable with himself after he is discovered by the academic community, but who uses that genius in a very distinctive battle of cultures. Dekker's work gets us to feel emotional about issues that bore us when we hear of them on the news--the plight of women in Saudi Arabia and the harshness of life under radical Islam. How does a single reluctant American whiz-kid free a Saudi princess from the bindings of a rigidly mysogynist society? You gotta read this book to find out. Rivals Grisham in suspense and good character development. you will not only sympathize with the main characters, you will really like them as people."
4,Judy box and book maker jgosi@hotmail.com,"10 years ago held up in my studio where I did my best to make two books. Later I studied at Penland School of Crafts in N.C. where I learned to make a book with precision. I've been making boxes and books since, sometimes I wish I had someone to confer with, that's where ""Books, Boxes and Portfolios and Mr Zeier"" come in. It's like having a friend with me in the studio. Some projects are easy but I would recommend it to someone who has some expierence working with exact measurements, and one who is patient."
5,A clear and useful introduction to bookbinding,"I have done several bookbinding and box-building projects, and have looked at a number of books on the subjects. This is the best introduction I have seen. I wish I had had it when starting out.The language is clear and effective. The illustrations (mostly drawings) are also clear and effective. There is a helpful listing of the tools needed. All are simple hand tools, and none are particularly expensive. The suggested materials are currently widely available. If you are thinking of doing a bookbinding project, and have no experience, this book is highly recommended."
2,Only discusses fondant and sugarpaste techniques,This book does not illustrate any techniques used with piped icing.There are some beautiful cakes but they are decorated with either poured or rolled fondant.
2,Fine if you like fondant,"Like many cake decorating books published in the UK, this book's cakes are not apt to have broad appeal to the US home baker. People who grew up with Aunt Betty's buttercream icing and Mom's frosted cupcakes after school may find the taste of the sugarpaste (rolled fondant) covering used on nearly all these cakes unfamiliar, too sweet, and with a stange texture. Most of the cakes are lovely to look at, but there is not a single one in here that I would actually make."
4,SO IT'S NOT HIS BEST...,"...even at his most mediocre (which this is NOT, by the way), Deaver can outwrite most of the genre writers out there today. ""Speaking in Tongues"" is a fast-paced, suspenseful thriller focusing on Tate Collier and his estranged family. Sure, there are some cliches but they certainly don't underwhelm Mr. Deaver's incredible writing abilities.This book doesn't have the usual trademark plot twists that have abounded in books such as ""Devil's Teardrop"" and the Lincoln Rhyme series, but there some sufficient surprises to satisfy the Deaver in all of us.The change in the characterizations of the Collier family is believable, and especially Bett, who turns out to be quite a heroine. The addition of Joshua as Megan's lover is also a nice twist, and the scenes in the abandoned mental hospital are effectively creepy.So chill out and enjoy the chills!"
2,I am soooo disappointed,"This is what I would call a ""it just so happened"" book. Too many unrealistic occurrences make this story less than believable. I concur with others in that this had to be written just to fulfill a contract. ""The Bone Collector"" and ""The Coffin Dancer"" were top notch; what happened here?"
3,Liberal bias,"I've been reading all of Deaver's newer books (got hooked on Lincoln Rhyme) and lately have been acquiring the older books, like this one from 1995.Although he uses a lot of ""filler"" to get a high page count, I still find pleasure in all his writing.But I was very annoyed when he included a fact that reveals his liberal bias regarding guns. Using a detective to add authority, a point is made that a six-shot revolver should always have an empty chamber under the hammer for safety.That was an accepted fact long ago but it is no longer the case. Such errors diminish my reading pleasure and make me wonder about the author's knowledge or intentions.Norm"
2,Did Jeffery Deaver really write this ?,"I just discovered Jeffery Deaver, starting with ""The Bone Collector"" (of course)- loved it ! & have since read ""The Coffin Dancer"", ""The Empty Chair"", ""The Stone Monkey"" & ""The Devil's Teardrop"". All were well written & suspenseful & had theat all-important dimension of excellent character development. I just finished ""Speaking in Tongues"" & can hardly believe that the same person wrote this one ! Not only is there a complete lack of any ""thrill"", the characters are as flimsy as cardboard. I'm glad I've read the other books I mentioned or I'd never have given him another chance. Every author is enttitled to a ""misfire"" & I guess this is one for the otherwise great Mr. Deaver."
2,Not the best of Deaver,"Over the years I have noticed that occasionally an author of exceptionally good novels will write a ""fill-in"" novel, i.e., almost as if it were written to complete a book contract, or to earn enough money to work diligently on the next effort. Speaking in Tongues is such a book. I cared little for the characters and found the novel second-rate. As my professors used to say, ""There is too much padding in this."" Deaver ""pads' this book and gives us too little of substance."
1,Ugh...,"I usually like Deaver's stories, but I actually only made it through half of the book...then tossed the thing. I am not crazy about the subject matter when it involves children (even if they are at the teen stage). Should have paid more attention to the info at the back of the book. And I definitely don't need to have obscenities every sentence. My mother always stated that people who swore constantly had nothing of interest to say. I find this to be true, even in my choice of literature. My time on this earth is too short to waste reading this type of material.So I am a prude...Karen Sadler"
4,Words DO matter,"An early twist sets the tone for this tribute to the power of words, which in this case are used mostly to deceive. Deaver takes us on a twisting journey that may or may not spell doom for the protagonist. The story kept me engrossed the whole way. The brutality is raw in a couple of spots, but the reader is rewarded with a satistfying ending. After reading this story, you might think twice about excessive flattery."
3,Good foundation for going solo,"I'm a huge Smiths & Morrissey fan, but i'll be honest, this is not a great album. I've always found a certain sincerity and romantacism in Morrissey's crooning which allows the listener to believe in everything he's trying to say. This album however seems forced and unnatural. Every song on this album with the exception of three, ""Suedehead"",""Everyday is like Sunday"" and ""The Ordinary Boys"" seems to pass me by and have no real effect on me. The music is very malnourished and predictable and Morrissey's lyrics are lacking on the inventive side. His voice however has never been better, sounding stronger and never out with his control. An interesting debut album but that's all, Please forgive me Moz :("
5,Adorable,"I had the great pleasure of watching Missy perform live at a Howie Day concert on Saturday in Atlantic City, NJ. She held the crowd captive with her lirics. Not only was she the cutest little lady but what a voice! I'm buying her CD today!"
4,Good Product,"Solid and durable. Color in photo matches item perfectly so you will get the exact color you choose. Diameter is slightly under 2"". So cut your hole smaller and then file open as needed to ensure a snug fit otherwise you will have to glue the item down."
3,"Good, but...","Why did PTerry need to burn all these letters? Just as if he needed to get rid off an inconvenient story line he didn't know what to do with. They were alive, for Om's sake!Or was it a size constraint imposed by the publishers? I demand to see the ""author's cut"" in the next edition!"
2,A Bit Shy,"Moist von Lipwig is a crock that has been punished by becoming the head postmaster; a real job is something a con never wants. The wit of Terry Pratchett is timeless and funny, but this book as a whole was missing the full package. Moist starts out in trouble and running from the law. He quickly finds his way to the local post office and in a world that holds letters that are older than he is. These undelivered letters begin to talk to him and he feels the pressure to get the post office back up and running. The clacks are a mechanical method for transmitting messages and have taken over for the post. Moist spends him time chatting up the papers and press to try and get the post office back on top.The characters are lovable and quiet human. The government bureaucracy will ring true regardless of time. The story line however, is not one of Terry's best."
4,"Good story, though not great in Discworld terms","I've read all the Discworld books up to this one. This isn't one of the best, but the story is still worth a read and Pratchett's word mastery is always present.Taking some more recent themes of hacking/cracking and telecommunications makes it a little more enticing to someone who likes technology. However, these particular topics are somewhat obvious, no great insights here.Good read if you like Discworld, but don't expect a great one."
1,worthless,"I could gather firewood, build a small campfire and bake the bread for my toast before this Euro Pro toasts my bagel. The unit has 3 knobs one is a temperature selection the 2nd is a baking method (broil, toast, oven, warm) and the 3rd is a timer. The icons state to set the timer at 10 minutes for a dark toast. Unfortunately I waited the 10 minutes and still very little color or toasting. My 10year old black and decker toaster oven is sooo much better than this. I mostly use a toaster oven to reheat pizza but with this machine a hairdryer could have done a better job. And, no my toaster is not defective it does get hot but it takes forever to do so. This item was a gift because we wanted a larger toaster oven. Do not purchase this product!"
5,comfy,These shoes are so comfortable and they conform to your foot very well. Great slip ons... so good that I bought a couple different colors. Well worth the price!
1,100% Junk,"This tester was incredibly cheap. I only have an occassional need for a tester, so I thought it might suit my needs. I was wrong. This thing did not work right out of the box. It won't cycle through a known good cable. This item is 100% junk. Now I have to decide if I want the UPS or the USPS to make a quick $5 from me so I can get the $5 refund from Amazon. Vendors putting out junk like this are getting away with it because it costs more to send it back than the cost of the item. They get their money and you get 100% junk. I will probably send it back just so they don't get their money. Given the quality of the unit, HDE will probably package it back up and send it to someone else. I would give zero stars if I had that option."
3,Handy and saves time,"While not of the highest quality, it does work and has saved me a lot of time. In this day of wireless everything there are still some things that I prefer to have hard wired. This little tool has saved me time and head ache on trouble shooting my home made network wiring. Not professional grade by any stretch, but handy non the less."
1,DOA,product arrived dead on arrival.the only light that worked was poweri returned the product for a refundthis product should be removed from the Catalog
2,Flimsy but still useful,"Larger unit sends voltage in order 1-8. Smaller unit shows lights up to corresponding connection. The OFF-ON(fast)-ON(slow) switch doesn't engage completely every time. Unit takes a 9V battery and it rattles (get some foam or cardboard to pad the battery compartment). Would be a good Idea to tape alternate wiring diagrams to the smaller unit, or relabel the numbers."
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,"You can tell it is not a Military grade product. However, it works just fine and the price is right for the occasional user. My directions were in Chinese so useless to me. But easy to use plug in both ends and watch the lights. Eight green lights and you have a good cable."
1,Single use only,"Used this for testing terminations in a home network, as well as for testing patch cables.Since another reviewer mentioned that his had died after a few weeks, I made sure to always take out the battery.Unfortunately, I left the battery in the switched off device for a couple of hours last week. Now, the device is dead.I had hoped that a new battery would make it work again. It did not.Now I need to find a better tester."
3,great for the price,a simple tester but works great for testing the cables. did not think i would get much for the price but was pleasantly surprised. very handy tool to have.
1,Up Up Up in a puff of smoke,"Looked like a really good deal and I am in the process of a house remodel and wiring. The first chance I had to test this was unfortunately 32 days after I purchased it. I inserted the 9-volt battery and turned it on only to see it light up for a second, pop and then see a puff of smoke. The instructions are in very broken English as if interpreted from Chinese (which the writing on the unit is in Chinese).I have contacted the merchant ""HDE"" but have not heard anything back and will update feedback if I do. I received it on time but just wish I had tested the unit sooner and could have returned it under the Amazon policy."
4,Simple and effective,"Sure, it's not built to survive a car driving over it, but if you're just looking for a simple and very inexpensive circuit tester to make sure you got all those teeny wires into the right slots and punched in all the way when wiring up your house for ethernet, this will do the job admirably. Plug a cable end in one half, take the other half to the other location and plug it in, turn it on, and if everything's good the little lights will march down the display in sequence, over and over. To test a jack, just make yourself a short length of cable (test it with the tool first!) to plug between the jack and this tool. The tool even comes with a little storage bag big enough to store that homemade 3-inch cable with it."
1,they look simple,"they seem to be store for years and the packate that they came with it was some what melted tothe actual cable tester.. I was disapointed of them, but since I don't care ofr statics I use them"
5,All Circuits a Go,"If you are making Ethernet cables, this is an invaluable and inexpensive tool to check for wiring continuity. I paid $6 for it; a 9 volt battery is required but not included."
1,You get what you pay for,"Out of the box, this unit was quirky. While the lights when fron 1 to 8 on the powered part, they went from 8 to 1 on the remote unit. I tested this on several straight through cables that I new were good, and since the behavior was consistant, I decided to deal with it.The 3rd time I turned it on, the powered unit light just burned steady and the test lights no longer lit.Since shipping cost more than the unit, I probably won't return. I will just break down and buy a better quality tester."
2,It works but that isn't saying much,"Yes it is cheap to purchase, the directions are very brief and the construction of this is pretty flimsy. Every time I turn the switch on I think I am going to break it. The jacks don't hold the rj-45 ends well so I question the results of the tester. You get what you pay for."
1,Switch is frozen..,"When I received the item, I put the batteries in it, and as soon as I went to flip the switch on the front, I realized it was stuck in place and can not be moved. This came as a package with something else I purchased and luckily this item wasn't the thing I was really wanting out of the package and have a good one here at the house or I would have been a bit ticked off.This is then cheapest plastic item I've ever held in my hands. I wouldn't suggest anyone buying it. Although I did get two 9 volt batteries out of the deal, but they are pretty cheap too. You get what you pay for and I guess they figured for $5 or what ever it is, people wouldn't spend the time trying to get another."
3,Alright,"The book is fairly comprehensive, but it is rife with mistakes, both in the literature and the workbook. The authors also make use of non-standard terms frequently. You can certainly learn a great deal from the book, but it's not without obvious drawbacks.The Rutger's University faculty recently tested the book over a two year period and have discontinued its use due to student feedback and teacher opinion."
4,Good if you like Baaba's Music,"The quality of this DTS DVD is not at all bad, though not up to the standard of ""Eagles - Hell Freezes Over"". It is the only DTS DVD I have seen that also has a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack so you can make direct comparisons between the two formats. The video quality is good, with the costumes colorful. Even if you've never heard of Baaba Maal but like Youssou N'Dour or other African musicians, give it a try."
1,Race Baiting Socialsit Agenda,This book is garbage. Steinbergs thesis is that evil white business class sticks it to minorities and the poor; and that there is no such thing as natural disasters. Disasters are really a capitalist tool to destroy and enslave miniorities and the poor. Dont buy it unless you have to read it as part of a class like I did.
4,Eds Review,Very comprehensive source for specifications and details that are relivent to interior design. Not sure yet about the ebook.Ed
1,dissatisified - never received,"I have never received this book!!Do I have any recourse in getting either this book sent to me - or in receiving my money back?!I am not pleased at all!Sincerely,John Maurer"
4,I'm part Karuk and I'm glad that I could learn some of my la,This is an excellent book and the aouthor is fantastic. My favorite creation story was A Trip to Indian Heaven.
3,"OK, with a few ""good"" moments","I expected a lot more from this book and have to say I was disappointed. There was nothing ""bad"" about the book-it was a quick, easy and nice read...but not memorable. The plotlines were predictable and the characters did not have much depth (particularly the father, Hank). I found the writing mediocre most of the time.There were a few great moments, more at the end of the book than the beginning. I knew how it was going to end, but didn't really care.There are much better books out there!"
3,"Predictable, but a good chick book",Kristen Hannah writes chick books. What's wrong with that? I find her books to be perfect summer beach reading. I liked this book ok. Is it amazing literature? No...but nevertheless... a good read with characters that you care about. Can the dialogue be a bit trite? Yes... but so what? I repeat! A good chick book for good summer reading.
3,Okay,"This was a touching story and a quick read. I did like the chemistry between Nick and Annie. The relationship between Annie and Izzy was touching. Some of the characters were not well developed and were only one dimensional. I felt very cheated by the ending. I think the book should have included the reunion between Izzy, Nick and Annie. I think it would have been emotional and a great ending. Instead I closed the book feeling disappointed."
2,Predictable and Unoriginal Dialog,"I made it through this entire book but, was truly un-wowed. The dialog was so predictable and incredibly boring. The characters were really not well developed. We got a perspective from each point of view yet, the whole story seemed incredibly flat. The only character I enjoyed was the six year old and she was only really 15% of the story. I found this to be mindless read and not at all like the other reviewers comments."
5,Another Incredible Book by Kristin Hannah!!!,"On Mystic Lake is a wonderful story about a woman who loses herself in the midst of family relationships and responsibilities. Hannah does a beautiful job of letting the reader see the pain of a broken heart and the healing of that same heart by way of realizing what is really important in life. Teaches some good lessons, as well. Very well done!!!"
4,On Mystic Lake: A Novel,I have just begun reading this book and really do like it. I'm excited to be reading this book for my book club.
4,"Great camera, but Polaroid is discontinuing instant products","As for how well this camera works, it's great. HOWEVER, Polaroid is discontinuing manufacture and sale of its instant cameras and film. So keep that in mind when you purchase. The price may drop if you really must get one. Also, Target sells them for $40, so I have NO CLUE why they are so expensive here. But anyway, I was about to buy one myself but I think I'll skip it now."
1,He wants $200 for that?,Geez... go to eBay and get a new one for $30. What a ripoff. The guy is just waiting around for an uniformed buyer to give him money. It's like selling someone a penny for a dollar. If ya don't know any better.... it's despicable and 100% unethical.
4,Rod the Bod is really quite Mod,"I remember returning to the States after being overseas for several years. One of the first songs I heard on local radio upon returning home was ""Lost In You."" It really jumped out of my stereo speakers, along with rockers like ""Dynamite,"" and ""Wild Horse."" I think that for Rod to really rock out, he needs to surround himself with musicians that will push him, and Andy Taylor certainly seemed to do so on this album. In fact, Andy practically incinerates his guitar on ""Almost Illegal."" I love the imagery in that song as well, with Rod rollin' in the hay with the farmer's daughter, and the farmer aiming to put some buckshot in the Mod One's tailfeathers. Rod's voice is in fine some on the ballads as well; his rendition of ""Try A Little Tenderness"" does justice to a timeless classic. Like other reviewers, I don't much feel like Rod has rocked out since this one, and I miss it. Let the Wild Horse run free indeed, Roddy!"
5,Beautiful luxurious silver tip Brush,"I have had this for several months now- wow. This is big, soft, holds a lot of water and soaps up quickly. It is soft on the face but firm enough to put the suds where they belong. The silvertip is similar to finest silvertip I'Ve seen elsewhere. THe price is right for this brush."
4,"Good, objective survey of the way people achieve happiness","I found this book very useful because its not preaching from one point of view, or with one ""fool-proof"" method. Instead, it is a professional psychologist's survey of research (from over 100 years) that objectively notes characteristics of happy people. It reaffirmed some beliefs I have, and shattered some others (such as more money = more happiness). Overall, this is a very well-researched, and yet pleasant book to read that makes you think about what makes you, the reader, happy in your own life."
4,The best history of early Christianity that I've seen,"As a Christian Yogi, I rather prefer this meaty and scholarly book to Pagel's books on similar themes. Highly recommended."
4,"In the Beginning, different views of Jesus rather than the Orthodox","Most people understand Christianity as monolithic, starting from Jesus and comming down to us in an unwavering line (at least until the Reformation). Not so! There were the Ebionites (ever heard of them?) the Marcionites, the Gnostics...with trails of these differing early Christian faiths continuint down to today.Why have we been kept so ignorant. Thanks to Prof. Ehrmann we now have a simple window with which to view these unknown faiths. The we have better prspective to judge our own and perhaps to form new concepts (out of old light). A very important book for any who would proclaim Christian faith."
5,Lots of knowledge,"Like I said, LOTS OF KNOWLEDGE shared in this book.Religious or not, you will LEARN lots of things you did not know!"
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"This is not worth reading, period. I can't believe this man is in charge of a religious study program in a major university. It only proves that intellect and academic study doesn't make you necessarily smarter. Knowledge is merely agreement, not truth. Knowledgeable men once thought the earth was flat, but the truth finally replaced that falsehood.After all it is not important what we believe or how passionate we are about some topic, it is only important what is true. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life."
3,could be better,"When Iam interested in a subject iam intensely interested and want to know every bit of information ABOUT THE SUBJECT. In the case of this book there is more history than information about genetics. I know there are many people who like the historical parts of scientific subjects so if your one of them i would reccomend this book. A more accurate title for this book would be ""the progression of genetic research"". If you want to know more about gentics and dna than the personal history of the author and his colleagues this book will not fulfill your expectations."
4,Nice case for my HG20,"Ordered this case with my Canon HG20 camcorder with free 2 days shipping. It's a perfect fit for my camcorder. I can keep Camcorder, AC adapter & cord, AV cable, composite cable, HDMI cable, USB cable, remote and even my Canon PowerShot A720 IS into this magic box. The case is looked bit bulky, but it really keeps the cameras safe from external damage because of its design and ruggedness."
3,"Good general guidance, but not enough troubleshooting help","A good enough general survey of the Macintosh operating system -- fairly complete, and easy to read and follow. However, for more advanced users there is not enough information on troubleshooting, which is what I think most users are looking for in a computer book."
4,Great TV with many cool features!,The TV/DVD player is everything it said it would be. Great picture and quality. Many auxilary inputs and the DVD player on board free's up a lot of space. Great tv for the bedroom with little space. Would want something bigger for TV viewing in a living room or den. Digital Tuner is slow but effective. The only features it doesnt have are audio out and smart sound volume control. Other than that a great product.
5,Quick and Basically Painless,Ashley is an absolute knock-out and Luke Perry is believable as the creature of habit husband.
1,This film really was horrible.,"It was very slow and tedious. For a supposedly realistic storyline about enabling, Ashley Judd's character was so overdone that the whole story couldn't be believed. I too did not understand why Ashley Judd had to be nude half the time. It came across as grasping to keep interest in the movie. It wasn't sensuous or enticing, so the viewer couldn't sympathize with/understand Luke Perry's character, and thus the whole meaning of the story was lost."
3,Over the Edge,Jimmy Stewart and Jane Wyman do a good job in this movie but the movie just goes past reality. A whole town turns greedy sort of like mass hysteria or something. It's too far out there for me. People don't act like that so couldn't relate and lost interest.
4,"If not for the Ramones, punk wouldn't be as accessable","From old rock and roll style songs like the classic ""Rock 'n RollHigh School"" and ""Do You Remember Rock 'n Roll Radio?"" to classicslike ""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker"" this collection is a great one to listen to. Some songs are more on the mellow side like ""I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend"" and ""Needles & Pins"" while others like ""Somebody Put Something in My Drink"" just plain rocks. Get this and Ramones Greatest Hits Live (which has their kicking cover of ""Spiderman"" and the song ""Pet Cemetary""). Then give them an honest listen and know why they inspired other punk bands that you hear on radio today."
5,Ramones Mania indeed,"Let me begin by saying this if you are a punk rocker and you don't have any ramones cd's stop reading this review and buy this cd. But for those of you who don't have the money or are new to the world of punk let me inform you about this cd. It has 30 of the ramones best songs (all of them are good) and the best ones are bonzo goes to bitzburg, howling at the moon, and mammas boy. If you dont believe me listen to the demos on amazon if rock is your thing I think you will be pleasently surprised. Overall this C.D. is great for new ramones fans and old fans who want some songs they can't find, heck its great for anyone who likes rock and roll. A deffinite 1-2-3-4! 5 stars"
5,Very good,A very basic simple device but very effective. Made my reception a ton times better! And good shipping to. All around a good purchase!
3,Best reporter in America writes !,"Good read, but basically re-hash of Bragg's news columns about experiences previously recorded in the books about his family.. ."
3,"This product is okay, but it could use improvements","I bought this lock with an alarm because I teach a college course and bring my laptop for displaying class notes on Powerpoint. As far as I know, the alarm feature on it works, and it's handy enough to anchor around a table or chair and lock to my computer.It would be nice if the cord was a little less ""stiff"" so it could more compactly wrap and pack into my carrying case. As it is, it's a bit bulky. I wind up hanging it on my closet doorknob when not in use, because I'm afraid that if I force it to wrap more tightly for storage, it might damage the alarm.The other element that would be nice as an improvement is in reference to the sliding alarm latch. If left in one position, the alarm is shut off to spare the battery, which is very practical for nonuse times. Unfortunately, that lid slides extremely easily, which means it's almost always using the battery."
2,Big Disappointment,"The critics almost unanimously seemed to love Thirteen Steps Down. Unfortunately I found it totally unconvincing. The plot involves a demented young man who's obsessed with a beautiful model and a famous real-life serial killer. He rents an apartment from a very old spinster who, somewhat like him, lives in a world of her own. When the young man turns killer, the plot spins out of control. Both characters are very two-dimensional."
3,Suspenseful but too fussy...would have made a better short story,"In a nutshell...a very readable story with lots of ""Oh they're bound to catch him now"" moments; so good as far as suspense goes but a let down at the end in that it just well, ended...nothing remarkable at all.I felt the book was too padded out with stuff that was really irrelevant, like the doctor that Gwen writes to (after reading his wife's obituary) in the hope of resuming their romance from half a century ago. Or the clairvoyant that everyone seems to visit and whilst she does tend to `see things' relevant to the characters...it's still really unimportant. The fixation with Narissa doesn't really need to be there either or her fixation with some other guy whom she realises isn't for her anyway.I'm glad I read it, it wasn't a bad read...I like suspense but not the best."
1,Lenovo Advanced Dock is Garbage,"I purchased this junk in March of last year, had it replaced several times because the power supply failed, internally stopped working and the latest incident started spewing smoke!!!Pure junk, and of course Lenovo will not support it. If you buy it be prepared to throw away your investment after a few months. Lenovo will not support it outside of the 12 month warranty period and even then will make you spend hours on the phone getting help.I wish I could give this product (and Lenovo for that matter) a lower mark than 1.Avoid this product"
3,Sleek design but lacking in sound,"The Zune Car Pack is a great, sleek FM transmitter for the Zune. Its compact size and OE-looking shape makes it less awkward and bulky like other FM transmitters. Its two button design and bright screen allows for quick station changes, even while in traffic. Also, since the transmitter has the Zune plug-in port on the bottom, you can still charge your Zune on the road while using the transmitter.However, the transmitter's sound quality can be somewhat lacking if you live in an area of high radio traffic. Even with the Zune placed as close as possible to the antenna it can still be blocked out by some stations. The trick then is to either hunt for one station that is rarely used in your area, or multiple stations that you can easily switch to on your commute.The Zune Car Pack is a great product that looks much better than other competitors, however, don't expect a miracle in transmission quality."
4,Excellant signal,"I had an older radio transmitter made by Zune that worked fairly well. I did get a lot of static. Wasnt too surprised by this as every other transmitter that I had ever used was the same.I was surprisingly shocked the first time I plugged the new one in. I only get static when I drive through certain areas where I loose radio signal anyway. This is without a doubt the 2nd best way to listen to music on the road. (The best way would be to have a hard wired signal) Also, when I realized that it worked WITHOUT the power cable being plugged in, I assumed battery life would be very short. I get about 6 hours of solid music on a single charge. (If you just let it play. No song skipping or scrolling for other music)I gave it only 4 stars for two reason. The first being: The transmitter does not click into the Zune. It can come unplugged with a gentle tug. Secondly, it does not have a memory for a second station."
2,Friggin Button,"I got this item for my zune thinking ""hey, this is really cheap now"" When I got it, it was shiny, pretty, and looked like it would be worth it. I plugged it in, and the audio was not great, but better than nothing. Then I found out that for some reason, any time I go near a semi or street lights, the sound nearly drops out completely. Then as I was unplugging it to take inside, one of the buttons that is set on the side of the car charging part came out and immediately disappeared. So now the fm transmitter may as well be glued to the adapter. All I can say is that if that had stuck to my Zune like that, I would have requested a refund for the kit and a new Zune. This happened within a week of receiving the item, and when I picked it up to unhook everything, the aforementioned button just fell out, without warning."
4,Zune Car Pack,"I bought this and then read the reviews- I was scared to use it thinking I would have to return it- but I had no problem with it- I did have to change the pre-set 88.1 to 87.9 and it worked great- sorry to hear others were not happy, but I would suggest everyone who wants it to try it first- only 4 stars because I have not tested on a long road trip yet-"
1,Yuck,"As far as technology has come - this is back in the dark ages. The FM Transmitter did not fit well into my Zune which meant that it would come apart or else we had to hold it in place while traveling. Reception went in and out and when it was in, it was fuzzy. Tried all stations, only one came through. This reminds me of the radios in my mothers old cars. Not recommended at all. Definitely returning for a refund."
2,RADIO RECEPTION FUZZY AND SPOTTY,"I used the transmitter for a while but after about 6 mos I bought a new one because 1) I lost the little transmitter that plugged in to the bottom of my zune, and 2) because it didn't work that well anyway. I bought one where the cord that was instered in the earpiece area actually contained the transmitter and eliminated the little piece which was lost and found several times on vacations and what not. With this model I'm reviewing, I was constantly having to stop and navigate through the radio and then through the transmitter to find a station that would work and be less fuzzy. It was horrible for highway driving and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,kind of defect law?,"Fist time I thought this unit is defective,so I try to make RMA issue to Amazon. but I have known this is not devective,all unit is bad standerd of new law,I have ended up to useless item. but I found it only one thing to get good sound, Get wire form ANT exit of your FM tuner and actually the wire it have to touch this useless device and you may get best sound!"
1,Should be condemed,This is by far one of the worst products that microsoft has released. I am sending this back tomorrow and I'll probably will get the belkin transmitter or a C Crane transmitter. So yeah DON'T buy this
2,"Superior player, Inferior accessories","I have little to no problems with the car charger at all. Keeps my Zune charged fine. I bought this primarily for the FM transmitter. It is very temperamental. If I set it on my dashboard where it has a line of sight to my antenna it's ok. But take a turn and the whole unit goes flying. I put it somewhere where there isn't line of sight to the antenna, and the reception dies off or is non existent. I can't wait till they have the hardwire for my Zune to wire it into the car like iPods do. When that happens this kit goes in the trash the next day."
2,"Nice execution, but very poor range. There's hope though...","I've purchased a number of FM transmitters and they all suffer from pretty low transmission range and clarity. The Zune Car Pack is no exception. I purchased this having already seen reports of low power. Boy were they right - it only sounded clear when it was literally within a foot or two of the radio. Any farther than that and the quality was horrible.Otherwise the device is slick. The transmitter has a nice interface and doesn't impact battery life in a noticeable way.I would have given it 5 stars if the FM range wasn't so pathetic.Now the good news. There's a hack out there that you can do that will increase the range at least 10 fold. It takes a bit of soldering and the point is pretty small, but the payoff is huge. I can now get crystal clear reception from anywhere in the room. Just enter ""zune fm transmitter hack"" in your favorite search engine.Good luck."
3,Not worth 80 bucks,"I heard an M$ guy say that this FM transmitter will be better than others because Zune has a radio and so the transmitter can sense which channel is free. But I tried it in 3 cars a BMW,an Accord and a Civic. It was not up to the mark on all three.It just scans the next available channel and does not look, in any way, sensing other channels.If in any way we can increases the power of the transmitter then it might work well."
3,Teased but not pleased,"Got this one when I bought my wife the Zune 120G. Looks great, seems awesome, but alas; the performace left me extremely wanting. Doesn't work with a protective skin in place and you had to stay directly on top of the unit you were listening too. But on a positive note the little FM tranny can goto work with you and play over your office radio quite nicely"
2,"Charger is fine, Transmitter is awful",There is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger. It works fine. However the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me. 1 -- The connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for Zune so you have to take it out of the case. 2 -- The signal is VERY WEAK and did not work for me in either of my cars. I ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100% better sound quality.
1,Do not buy the FM adapter...,...unless you really like static and noise in your music.I just went through every location on my radio dial that's not a local station and the best signal I got was garbage; at best. I cannot believe that someone would release something that is so obviously horrible.My girlfriend's iPod FM adapter works flawlessly in this area so I know it's not just busy FM radio signals.This is a joke. I'm returning it tomorrow. I'm going to have to figure out a way to hard wire the Zune into my car stereo now.
1,Don't Buy,Do not buy this. I had to hold it right up to the antenna to get clear sound. I called Zune support and they said it has to be within 2 feet of the antenna to get the best sound. That is a little difficult with my car antenna outside and in the back. Microsoft should recall this product.I used to have a Mr. Microphone that worked better.
5,Great Buy,Scott Estill's Tax This! gave me all the info I need to fill out my tax forms. I recommend this book to all of my friends.
2,You gotta be kidding with those five star reviews,"This recording has a few half decent songs, but most of the material is quite boring. I just don't see how anyone could give this five stars, and I can't believe it has such a high Amazon sales ranking. This is probably due to the fact that this CD includes the song What's On Your Mind (Pure Energy). If it wasn't for the fact that this song is on this recording, another zero or two could be added to this CD's Amazon sales ranking. There is techno music that is much more interesting than this stuff. My copy of this CD is going straight to e-bay."
4,A packed small book...,"I really enjoyed this book. I have a daughter who is 22, that has lied to everyone about everything for years. After reading this book, she came up to me, told me to read and apologized for everything. She told me that she needed help and that she was a compulsive liar. Hearing those words hurt me, I simply told her to stop lying. After reading the book it helped me understand. My only complaint about the book is that I wished he wrote more. It's an excellent book."
5,"Crystal Portal, Singing Bowl Journeys","This is my favorite crystal bowl CD! The flute adds a magical touch to the vibrations of the bowls. Thank you, Elivia and Cyrstal Vibrations Music Ensemble for such a beautiful gift! I honor you in the highest light!"
3,head of unit dislocated,"I received this unit quickly and was initially pleasedwith it but could not get the head to tighten down on the rotation of head put it away for the day, when I opened it again the head feel off in my hands broke loose from the tubing shaft that cranks it up I called 47th street photo and explained the problem and they replaced the unit within the week very pleasant to deal with would not hesitate to buy from them again."
2,"great at first, didnt last.","The tripod lasted barely a year. Great at first, but then over a period of time, the plastic at the joints start to break.The size made traveling s bit of a nuisance, and when you have a professional camera and lenses, u wouldn't want to mount on a tripod where the plastic breaks off. Look elsewhere."
5,Love the stability!,"I love this product! I was kinda worried that it wouldn't be as good as the tripod I recently lost. It's EVEN BETTER! I think all of the extra material which allows for more height creates a lower center of gravity when not fully extended. When I have all of the knobby things tightened, this tripod does not move while panning. This is very important for me."
2,Shaky!,It is only good to take still photos using light-weight cameras because when you use heavy lens with yous slr or a big video camea it will shake with any slight touch. But since it is cheap you can use it to take still photos with light-weight cameras
2,For still pictures ONLY!!!,"I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod. Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be. Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to ""unwind,"" causing your panned image to back up a little ways. Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a ""Photo / Video"" tripod.Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters. Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head. You'll love it, I guarantee that.That's why I give this one 2 stars."
5,First Tripod,"This is my first tripod. I have been asking my friends about buying tripods and I came across this tripod. For $20, a 70"" tripod and all the other features along with it. It is definitely a great buy. It is more that what I was looking for within my budget."
5,Great Tripod Lightweight,"Opteka 70"" Full Size Professional Photo / Video TripodThis tripod is simple to use and very lightweight. Great for photography/videography on the go. Has a level, feet are adjustable(not flat they swivel and tilt as needed) to have your tripod sit level. Would highly recommend."
3,This tripod is...,Its a good tripod for the price. I am a little freaked out that all of the parts are plastic.
4,hard to find item,"hard to find item, it seems to work well,quality is good, great if you need the extra leverage of the 3/4"" drive ratchet on a smaller size bolt"
4,The Buddenbrooks on DVD,"When I was a teenager, growing up in Hamburg, Germany (which isabout 1-1/2 hours away from Luebeck, the setting for the Buddenbrook history) I read the Thomas Mann book, which my parents had in our library.Of course, now that I'm 81, I didn't remember too much of thebook, but the video brought much of it back to me.I liked it, but I believe that not too many people, not acquainted with that region of Northern Germany, and thehistory of the cities belonging to the Hanseatic League, which include Hamburg, Luebeck, Bremen and a few others, would bethat interested in this family's story.Still, it is an epic story of a bygone era, and I enjoyed seeing it.Edith E. Finke"
2,"Breyer 6"" Asley Doll","Pros: I Really Liked this breyer doll specifically because she comes with a pad, and polo wraps. Her hair is braided, and she is wearing a helmet. She also has a belt, chaps, and a vest. She is a perfect size to fit on most breyers!Cons: Her hair ribbions fell out a couple of days after i bought her, and they are really small and hard to get back on. She Does have a really creepy face, with weird fake looking freackles. The end of her pants are starting to frey, and her boots are really hard to get off. The Worst thing though is about 2 months after i bought her, i was trying to put her on a traditional breyer(She is better for a classic sized horse) Her right leg fell off. I couldnt snap it back because some of the plastic holding it on broke too. I Wish i bought some other breyer doll.If You do buy her BE CAREFUL when putting her on a breyer and taking off her boots. She will break very easily."
1,she is nice but can not ride well I WAS DISAPIONTED,i have this doll and her legs do not bend I was very disapointed and she is not really bend able. Her polos are to small so they do not work but i do like the helment and that fits but her boots are also to big they fit my other doll brenda I would neaver get this $25.00 doll again i was DISAPIONTED i much prefer brenda
1,"Mr. Harris, will you please kiss writing good-bye?","I made the mistake of buying Mr. Harris' earlier book, ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"", which was poorly written and full of Biblical verses taken out of context. Although his intentions seem sincere, the abuse of scripture continues unabated. He should take his earnings from his previous books and kiss writing good-bye."
2,I kissed this dating book goodbye,"My friend had this book and she let me borrow it right after my boyfriend and I broke up. It did have alot of good points, I will give it that...but it made dating sound like the ultimate sin. I've dated one guy and it's been with the outlook that I could one day marry him. I don't see anything wrong with dating so I believe that the author was pretty much off base. I think we should take his thoughts into consideration but not base our own principals around what he said. So all in all, I think you'd be better off buying a book about how to date effectively with God in the relationship"
5,zoinks.,"This book is awesome! I really recommend it to teenagers and college age people. The book is basically saying Don't worry about finding a husband. God will find one for you, and to just stay focused on him, and stay in his will. That's about all I can say!"
5,This is a book that changed my way of thinking and my life.,this book helped me to realize that there is no hurry in finding a husband because God has it planned for me and it is completely under his control. This book has help me to look at guys and myself differently and has given me patience to wait for God to let me know when i am ready. My college roommates and i read it together and talked about it. We all LOVED it! I would recommend it to anyone but especially those who want direction and a reassurance about ther future.
3,A good starting point,"I am saddened that previous reviewers felt they had to resort to using foul language to express their viewpoints. I appreciate Josh's communication of his thoughts and opinions. Howoever, I believe that God is able to use any method. Look at how Isaac found Rebekah (see Genesis 24)! I do not think that exclusive dating is wrong; however, I feel young people such as myself should be careful to know our motives for doing so. We must allow God to use anything He desires to draw us closer to Himself. God desires intimacy with us and He asks us to trust Him. In some cases, dating might be a way in which we can demonstrate complete trust in His plan for our lives."
5,great book,"this was an awesome book! im so glad i read it..it helped me a lot when i was having some personal relationship problems. now im healed from the book and from God. thank Josh for writing it, and thank God that i read it."
1,Dating is not ungodly,"ok, let me start by saying that I am a christian teen, I love God more than anything and I am a servant of him. But, I do not for one second think that dating is bad. You say that by being in a relationship it takes time away from God, well if that is true then you must outlaw friendships as well, anything can take away from God, but that is why we must learn self control, in order to stay focused on him. I do not believe that dating is bad, but sometimes its intentions are. God works through people all the time and sometimes people have pain that they can not bear alone and a GF/BF is just what they need to make it through,,,,this does not mean that they are excluding God, what is means is that God is working through a person to help someone....so get it straight, and stop acting like everything in the world is evil and sinful.....thank you"
1,Disappointment,"Don't bother reading this book, everything you need to know is found in the Bible. Harris' book flaunts and romanticizes chivary, when in reality love never boasts."
2,totally disagree...,"This is a well written book for those who have same kind of thoughts. But for those who disagree with him, it is a poorly written book. I am one of the people who disagree. It seems like this book is just based on the author's personal experiences. He wrote this book based on what he felt, saw, and heard. Since he had some bad experiences in his dating relationships, he thinks all the dating relationship is not good.He also says that dating someone distrubs the pure christian life, but I think this opinion is also just based on his thought. I've seen many great christians who are in dating relationships.I'll say that I do not recommend this book for those who are in dating relationship or getting into one. Specially, for non-christian readers, do not read this book, it may look just stupid."
3,Not bad.,"They had some good songs and they're all included here, but there are some forgetable ones also. Hinds was really not that good of a singer, but she had a great band behind her. Certainly worth the money and some enjoyable listening. I just used the select button a lot."
4,Works great for exercise ball,"Some people have complained about this pump, but it works great for inflating an exercise ball and my husband and I haven't had any problems with it."
2,What happened to the original version of this book?,"I read the original version of this book when it was first published in 1987. If you want to avoid the religious rhetoric, check out that version instead. The old version is excellent. I give the new version only two stars because the pervasiveness of born again Christian thinking is a dissapointment and a distraction from the principles that can help anyone (not just Christians) struggling with their weight or body image. I am happy for Judy that she has found her spiritual path, but it is really a shame to alienate people who do not share her beliefs.That said, the concepts of this non-diet lifestyle are excellent. It teaches you to listen to your body and take value judgements out of evaluating food. No food is forbidden, but you commit to eating only when you are truly hungry. As simple as it sounds, it takes tremendous commitment, time and compassion toward yourself to make this change - but if you do you wont regret it! Good luck."
1,What the heck!,My wife and I turned off the dvd when about 20 minutes into it Stanley Tucci tells his wife that he sodimized his mom and than to bring the point home said that he [...] his mom.Someone complained about the smoking but wasn't offended by the incest remarks. That's strange.Matt
4,"Very thoughtful, original","Enjoyed this movie. It's original and fresh, and it's not the usual remashed stuff Hollywood provides us with when it comes to relationships. So if you're taking a bit of a risk, rather than sticking to the same story told one million times, have a look. Another good film with Stanley Tucci (but directed by Vern Oakley) is A Modern Affair, a film about what it means to love and have a child when the means to getting pregnant have dramatically changed in our modern world. A really good read. I mean, a really good view!"
5,BEST ONE EVER!!!!!,"I read Linda Lael Miller books all the time. This book is by far the most outstanding of them all. I have never experience the feeling that I felt the first time I read this book. I, myself, fell in love with Aidain. Forever and the Night is the most touching love story of desperation, desire, and forbidden love. The sacrifices Adain makes throughout this story, makes it even more touching. I believe this book should become known as a timeless classic. Everyone who has ever loved should read this book."
1,Not the stuff type is made of,"Forget the ending preposition. There are too many mistakes in this book to use it. From illegible type, bad printing, and examples that do not illustrate the points being made, this is not a book to buy.Save your $$$ and get the book, ""The Complete Typographer"" by Christopher Perfect. After years of teaching typography, this is a book that covers the basics and more.Interesting is that both of these books are from the same publishers.For a more advanced look at type get ""The Elements of Typographic Style."
5,"As usual...One of the BEST, If not THE best read yet","Vince Flynn writes better than most. If you are Politically Incorrect, then this is NOT the book for you. However, if you are an american with even the smallest amount of pride in your country and or the men and women who fight and die to preserve your freedoms, then this is a must read."
3,WHAT A LET DOWN,"I could not put this book down for very long. It had suspense, drama, intrigue, and other great qualities.BUT--I could not believe the author would leave me hanging at the last page!! The story does not have an ending!!I will not buy any more books by this author as he evidently a continued serial writer.Victor Cassano"
5,Outstanding,"Simply put, this was an outstanding book. If you are a guy then Vince Flynn's books are for you. Lots of action with just a touch of romance. You become very attached to the characters, epsically Rapp and Rieley. In the Mitch Rapp series it is hard to put one book above any other and the third option stays true to all of that, very well written. I am by no means the fastest reader around and being a soldier myself mt time can be at a primeium but I finished this book in two days, impossible to put down."
4,Very good,"This book builds on his former 2 hits ""Term Limits"" and ""Transfer of Power"". Although the book stands alone it helps to have read the previous ones. Both of which are also very good.This book continues on with the story of Mitch Rapp who is a top notch spy/assassin. He is double crossed and returns to find out who set him up. Other characters from the previous books show up and have good parts. I think the story was well written and characters well fleshed out (maybe because I already knew them from the previous stories).I did drop it a star because the book ended setting up another sequal (however I am ready to buy and read the sequal)."
3,I recently became a fan of Vince Flynn,"Good, but not great. I started reading Vince Flynn a few months ago and I am going in order. This is the 3rd in the series and so far, the least impressive. I still liked it, but it lacked some of the excitement of the previous two. I bought the 4th so I will certainly continue. This book sort of just ends and I guess is continued in the next."
4,"Good, but not incredible","He does a good job to entertain us, and you learn more about Mitch, but Its not as spell-binding as Memorial Day. That book had me on the edge of my seat!"
5,Great action,Typical Mitch Rapp thriller...goods suspense although it ends leaving the exposure of the main villain unresolved. Does the next book pick up there?
2,Running out of gas....,"Let me start by saying that I have read the both previous books by this author. I found them outstanding,they were a perfect fix while waiting for Clancy to put out a new offering. In fact I thought that this author was molding his own style and it was pretty darn good! However this one missed the mark. It started out slow and the pace just did not pick up. Yes the characters that I loved in the other boosk were here. I really did not like the idea of bringing the characters from two seperate story lines into one novel. I kept expecting action to break out but it never happened. I made it to page 266 before calling it quits. It has been sitting in my desk drawer for months. I hope the next novel picks up where the first two left off."
1,The book series is marvolous but I didn't realize I was buying an abridged copy and too much was left out.,Vince Flynn is a very detailed writer and has made Mitch Rapp bigger than life. Abridging the reading made the book very mundain and I felt I needed the full copy. I also would have loved to download it to my Kindle Fire rather than buy discs because the chance of getting a bad disc when buying used copies is very likely and disc 3 didn't work in my audio book.
3,Third option review,The product was in great condition.I was happy to see that it was in the conditionthat was expressed in the seller review on Amazon.I intend to purchase from them again in the future.Darnell Lepre
1,Unfinished Business,"Old movie serials left you hanging for the next installment. Most TV shows are complete to themselves, including ""The West Wing."" Here, the author wants us to read the next installment, so he left us with ""Unfinished Business."" He wants us to buy the next book, rather than being satisfied with a complete story. Granted that many suspense writer leave a ""hook,"" but this author didn't finish the book. Perhaps his next book will be the Fourth Option. If you read Robert W. Parker, each book is complete. Overall, Parker is much better than Flynn."
5,Good for cheesecake bases too,"In the UK many, if not most, people use digestive biscuits as a base for cheesecakes etc. Crush them in a plastic bag and use like Graham crackers. I've found people seem to prefer the base produced with the digestive biscuits"
4,American Scream,"Having loved Bill Hicks for some time I decided to read this book and was not disappointed. There is a depth to Bill's life that you see from the topics of his comedy but that gets lost in his more controversial jokes. This book shows you the other side to Bill and you realise his humour comes from an intelligent(which we already knew), almost spiritual place. It is fascinating to see how he developed his comedy and how he experimented and grew in his life. A great read about a great man. I wish he was here to comment on America and the world now!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Impressive story about an impressive comedian,"This book tells the story about the one comedian who's voice is being heard more now that he's dead than when he was alive. Like most good artist, Bill Hicks was about ten years ahead of his time.This book goes into detail about Hick's upbringing, his rise as a comedian, and his death. Along the way, you can't help but feel that all he really wanted was to evolve peoples perceptions.Cynthia True did an excellent job of presenting both the good and bad about Hick's while still showing that Hicks was a man of moral's and principle."
3,An Average Writer with An Above-Average Subject,"True is an average writer, and the book reads like an edition of People Magazine. However, it is interesting to learn about Hicks beyond his brilliant comedy act. Interesting to learn that Denis Leary stole much of his act from Hicks. This is an average book that at times makes even the fanstastic Bill Hicks seem pedestrian. It could use some re-write."
4,Another 6-Pack Please,"This album would have got 5 stars but like another reviewer pointed out, sound quality wasn't what it was cracked out to be. Good album though as far as the contents are concern. I love old ZZ, always have. And please answer this one people, why don't you hear anything from their debut First Album on any radio stations? I don't get it either. This album is pure rock and roll as it was meant to be. Shakin' Your Tree, Going Down To Mexico, awesome! Francine, can't get enough of Just Got Paid, Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers, and the list goes on. For being a three man band, they kick major A**. I would recommend this album if you just want to get a taste of ZZ, but if you're a true fan, go out and get their albums, with better sound quality."
1,What went wrong?,"These CD's sound fake! Did they re-record all these albums in a tunnel with a drum machine? I have these records on vinyl and they sound a thousand times better! At first I got pumped when I saw such an awesome boxset of classic Top. When I heard it, it was another story. Do not buy this, urge WB or whoever to re-release it UNREMASTERED, it sounds better the way it was done the first time."
2,Bad remaster job,I will also say that the remastering of these CD's are bad. I can not give this set more than 2 stars.
1,I'm twice disappointed,"First i've bought the six pack, no comments. Second: I've thought: ""the singles must have the original sound......"" so i've bought ""tres hombres"" but what a surprise: ¡This one has the same horrible sound.........!"
1,Classic Music But Terrible Sound!,"These original 6 albums are classic American blues-rock, plain & simple.The problem is that they remixed these gems to sound ""modern"" in an '80's sort of way.Now if that's your thing and don't mind, then fine, this is a good set to have if you're into that drum machine & synthesizer sound.However Tres Hombres & Fandango have been re-issued & re-masterd and don't sound half bad, though I have to admit not quite as good or ""original"" as the vinyl LP's did, (I still have mine!).So why do we live in a world that the record companies have to screw the fans on a regular basis?"
1,No point,"The author says it himself, he used the title to make you buy the book. I did not learn much from the book, was rather boring and painful to finish. He could have as well just written reviews on amazon for Deepak and Oprah, it would have been the same, then writing a book about criticizing them."
5,Empire of the Sun,"Great music, realxing and inspiring. The corals are a beauty.Excelent respond for delivery... quick and simple. Empire Of The Sun: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"
2,Okay--But Not Good Enough,"This book gives an average overview of the conflicts of interest that take place on Wall Street. Much better volumes include Robbing You Blind and Tricks of the Trade by Mark Dempsey. There should be more detail and examples, but sadly there are not!"
2,DangerKitty,"I just got this book. Thought I'd try it for prevention. I don't have any wrinkles or sagging yet. One thing I noticed that made me very leery: The people shown in the before and after pictures are wearing the exact same clothing, including accessories. The pictures were supposedly taken 7 days apart. I e-mailed the company and asked about this; I told them it made me think some Photoshop had been used. I was told they purposely had the models wear the same clothes and makeup. Ummm...OK. Also, the instructional pictures in this book don't really show you anything. In fact, most of the sequential photos are identical. I asked about this too, and I was told to buy the DVD. Ummm...OK.I've heard good things about the book Face Building. Maybe I'll try that."
5,Advanced Facercise,"Advanced Facercise is an amazing book! Carole Maggio has helped me to ""face"" the world with confidence. She is a master. I now face the world with a radiant and youthful appearance.Marilyn Powers, Ph.D. author, speaker, life coach, Phoenix, AZ"
2,not my favorite,"I read this book after reading ""Face Lifting by Exercise"" by Senta Maria Runge. I'm not impressed. The ""driving"" facial exercises listed are both dangerous to do while driving (placing fingers around your eyes and squinting or looking up) and really just duplicates from the previous pages (nothing new or redesigned). I also found the descriptions on how to specifically move the muscles incomplete compared to Senta Maria's book. I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"No one has commented on my face yet, but I can see a difference. I like what I see in the mirror. Thanks Carole."
2,Still Not Convinced,I saw the book at the bookstore and decided to give it a try. I also saw the video on TV and bought that so I could see Carole actually doing the exercises to avoid doing them incorrectly. I have been doing them for three months faithfully and have seen no difference as yet. I am still not convinced that there is anything to this!
4,It's not a book you'd leave on the coffee table...........,"Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator KitIt makes sense to me that you can tone the muscles in your face, so I was very curious about this book. I've been following some of the exercises every day - while I'm on the treadmill, or driving, or when I first wake up. No one has run up and said my face looks tighter, but I think it's starting to! Exercising your face is like exercising anything......it feels really good when you stop. And because it helps circulation, my complextion seems to have a nice little glow. It's a really affordable book, and well worth the money. I keep it in my nightstand!"
3,Sketchy Pics,"Though there is nothing wrong with the exercises, it does need clearer instructions for a few of them. The before and after pictures are questionable as well-like taking a before pic in the daytime and an after in a heavy fog."
4,Simply put: it works.,"Last fall, at age 52, I noticed that my face had begun to look as if it was melting - everything sagged. I bought this book in December, and within a few weeks, the changes were evident. People I didn't see regularly began to ask whether I had lost weight, which I had not. Now, after 10 months, I am very pleased indeed.The only reason I haven't given this five stars is that the instructions for the exercises should be more clearly written, or should be illustrated. I teach technical writing, and this book would not pass the clarity requirement."
1,Save your money-,"Never got a response to my email asking they change the destination address. Bracelet is not nearly as nice as shown on site, stones have nearly NO color."
3,This book is about...,This book was a diary written by Elizabeth. Elizabeth and her family and were coming from England to the new land of America. They had to built houses when they got here. Life was hard in the new land. They met Indians. Elizabeth liked the Indians but the other people were afraid of Indians.
1,disappointed,"This book's cover is beautiful but you cannot judge a book by it's cover! The content, of course, is the beautiful story written by O. Henry but the way it was printed, left a lot to be desired. The illustrations were okay but lacked in depth. For me they evoked very little and I was disppointed, personally speaking, that they were not in color. The printing and such looked like it had been done by a bunch of people who didn't know quite what they were doing. For example, the title page was horribly off-center. Compared with the other publishing of the story which you sell for about the same price with illustrations by Lisbeth Zwerger, this one is really a loser. Honestly, I was surprised that you would offer it--especially at about the same price."
4,Like it,It is a good book to read to family. If u want to see a movie get mickeys once upon a christmas .
5,Gift of the Magi Review,"It was a pretty good book by O.Henry in which he tells us the story of the young marrid couple of Jim and Della and how, inspite of being poor they sacrifice their most prized possessions to show their love for each other. All in all it was a pretty good book with a deep philosophical meaning."
5,Awesome book,This was an awesome story about the love two people have for each other and the sacrifices they were willing to make for the love of their life!! I recommend this book to anyone.
5,Love it!,"Was a new game to me, never saw it in the store. Love how quickly it arrived and it is now a family favorite."
5,Wow instant relief,"I've only used these DVDs maybe ten times because the improvement in my back is so great that I don't feel like I need to do the exercises anymore, although I know I should still be doing them. The Back Rx program is effective, inexpensive theropy."
1,broken motherboard,"amazon I WOULD LOOK INTO THIS ABIT A17 MOTHERBOARD I've been looking for one of those for months.the only one that I have seen sorry to say has been listed on ebay and everybody who winds up with it says its broken,now I,NOT TRYING ANYTHING...I just think you should think twice about listing that motherboard I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR MONTHS there only seems to be one around.I just dont want anyone to get stuck with a rare find that might be broken to start with.I send this message because I buy alot of stuff threw you and I have never been unhappy with the services you provide."
4,It's Star Wars...,"This, like all the other Star Wars EU books, is a fun and easy read. My only complaint is that both books in the Dark Tide storyline are pretty short and could have easily been combined into one book."
5,#3,"leia travels about being saved time and time again kinda like daphane on scooby doo.anakan programs valuable info for the republic and has little trouble killing vongs unlike everyone else.jaonas a lt already shes so good!the vong capture and lose ppl frequently.anakan and jacen solos sibling rivalry chills a little as they creep ever closer.the vong use slaves as soldiers via mind control.they use one of the coolest methods for really messing up your enemies ive ever read.bu this time theyve messed up a lot of planets in the ne section of the world.the good guys have it even worse off as rhe republic unties connecrions to the jedis.everyones running about looking for weopons of mass distruction.although there are no known sith,some jedis feel the dark side calling them when they need that little something extra for battle.the drama continues!"
5,The Jedi Strike Back,"I think Stackpole does a wonderful job of showing all sides of the war between the Yuuzhan Vong and the New Republic.He also includes the difference of opinion between the Jedi.Which is an important idea. That and the fact that Corran Horn is now Jedi and goes Medieval on the Yuuzhan Vong, make this one of Stackpoles best books so far."
3,Good crackers...bad packaging,"I gave these 3 stars because I really like the flavor of these crackers, but as stated in many of the other reviewers' comments, they don't hold up in shipping, so for the packaging, I would only give them about 1 star. I actually purchased 18 boxes (3 cases), 6 each of the 3 flavors and I had to open all 18 boxes to just get enough ""whole"" crackers for my guests (8 people) for Thanksgiving appetizers. I could only get about 6-8 crackers per box that were not broken literally into crumbs. I did, however, contact the factory and they were very apologetic and said they will address the problem and offered to send me additional boxes. Hopefully these will arrive in better condition and they will get the problem resolved, because I would love to keep purchasing these crackers."
5,Amazing insight!!!``,"This DVD provides an in-depth look into the life of football players. With NFL players such as Deion Sanders agreeing with the accuracy of this potrayal, it is not a suprise that the NFL exerted an unusual amount of pressure on ESPN to cancel the show, even going to the point of not including ESPN in its new TV contract. These are rich, gridiron athletes who use their money and power to navigate their way through a host of issues and we also see that these players also come with vices. This is a must-buy for any real NFL fan as well as the casual ones. Great work by ESPN, this series should have lasted a few more years than it did."
4,"TOO SHORT LIVED, ESPN SHOULD HAVE CONTINUED THE SERIES",WOW! I was hooked from the first episode. ESPN GOOFED when they took off this series. I feel it could have gone a long way if they played their cards right. ESPN could still pick up and make amends to fans and those who didn't get the opportunity to experience the great show.
2,Russia,Mainly a series of names and dates. Difficult to get through - not an interesting writing style.
2,You've got too be kidding,This game is not one of my favorites. The questions and challenges are redundant. Was not impressed. Would not recommend to others.
4,fun,fun games. My daughter age 9 finds this game to be very entertaining. good clean humor. Id recommend to a friend.
5,Soap was the best and funniest show ever,"Got the whole series and we do a once a wek during the winter, SOAP nite:)We sit around and howl at this show. Even though we watched it when it was on TV can't believe how funny it is...OMGGet it...All of the episodes.."
4,Soap - The Complete First Season,"Funniest lines ever on this show (and for those who love it as much as I do, will know what I'm talkng about).Ya gotta love Jessica:When discussing Plato being homeosexual: Mickey Mouse's dog is gay??When Jessica learns Jody is going to be a father: Dennis is pregnant??"
5,Simply The Best,It doesn't take a genius to know that this soap opera was ahead of its time. The cast was outstanding and it seemed as if this was an actual family with all the hijinks that were always going on. I bought the first season and have watched it probably 10 times already. It is well worth the money I paid for it and I can't wait to find out if the other seasons are coming out on DVD too.
5,FINALLY!!,"I don't have this in my possesion soon but I can't wait! I've been hoping and wishing that someone would finally decide to give one of the best comedies on television the ""complete first season, DVD"" treatment. 'Bout damn time! ;)BTW, I'm rating this 5 simply because the show is so funny."
5,Randy Travis CD- Old 8 X 10,"The CD was in very good shape, case was good, the only thing I didn't like was there was no picture sleeve in the case. But I would definately buy again."
4,Batman action figures,"My grandson is 4, and he enjoys these figures immensely. They are sturdy, well made, and seem to be able to withstand rough and tumble play."
4,The plastic shell casings manufactured incorrectly?,"For some reason, in my set the pieces looked like they were broken or manufactured incorrectly. On my friend's set, the glass covered both sides of the letter tiles. But in my set, the glass only covers one side and you have to always stick the blue squares back into the glass casings. Very annoying, since they keep falling out every time."
4,works great,"Works great on my carpeted bedroom floor. I think my master bedroom is too large for this thing to heat completely, so it pretty much runs all night long to get the room to 75 degrees (my wife likes it Africa hot... I have a fan on me to cool me off... the things we do for women)...Anyway, no problem here with the safety shutoff not working properly on our carpeted floor. And my electric bills haven't skyrocketed."
1,Avoid!,"This worked great for a month or two. But, eventually, it wouldn't even heat up; it'd say the room temp was 67F and I'd crank it to the max setting and nothing would happen. This is even after resetting it and doing whatever I could. I even blew it out with canned air (trying to get the temp sensor to read lower) and that didn't even get it to kick on. Oh well."
3,It's Party Time,The Revels' collection is great musical history; musically it's a bit thin. In any case the group sounds like it's having a great time. That's worth something.
4,Buy as a reference book,"I purchased this as a companion to lost Christianities. I actually read the whole book. I think due to the complexity of understanding the language and context of who wrote each separtate document I would just read the following:The gospel of Thomas(this is excellent, it shows Jesus as a Buddhist/Gnostic and a lot of it is in the original gospels)The gospel of Philip(It teaches marriage to someone unlike yourself is adultery)The gospel of Mary.(Shows Mary's leadership)The rest should be used for reference if needed. I have studied religion for ten years and these writings were over my head.Very Gnostic and mythical.But excellent gathering of the ancient texts."
2,New Teswtament Apocrypha,The book arrived in good order and a timely fashion. I think I should have been more mindful of the author and what he was doing. It appears that he is providing his translations of a whole variety of writings related to the New Testament Apocryphal writing. It will be worth reading. I would have appreciated more annotation and will search that out through a different venue.
1,Hole in it the first time it was used.,This tube got a hole in it the very first time it was used. We had sad and disappointed grand children.
1,TRITE AND REPETITIVE!,"Now I know why Jay Z has not retired. He has no one one his roster that can carry the weight. This album suffers from lack of originality. Who cares how many people he has shot. These Roc-A-Fella dudes are garbage. And he has the nerve to challenge Nas? Please. He basically ruined EPMD's classic ""So Watcha Sayin"". He was outshined by guests,Jigga Man, Kurupt and Scarface on tracks 8, 10 and 12 respectively. Those are the only tracks that make this album worth listening to. That Freeway cat has the most annoying voice since Cool C. I will not tell you to buy this or not to buy this, but I know that I am sorry that I bought it. QB Represents!"
4,I heard Daniel White...,"was a co writer on the screen play of BrokeBack Mountain. I've met D.White and I'm here to tell you if anyone had the experience to write about gay Cowboys it would be him.I'm sure he did alot of research on this fantastic project. Daniels writing skills go far beyond the classic horror genre, they now have come to opitimise the present horror genre. Way to go Daniel congrats on all your success. Hope you had a great time at the Oscars and the after parties in West Hollywood. Tell Brian I said Hi. Your Pal, Al"
3,Daniel white is not a nice guy.,"Hes pretty rude really. i got this at one of his book sighnings and well he was a jerk. Not at first though. Heres what happened. i went up to him he was wearin that red shirt he wears you know and well, i said ""dude i wanna buy one"" and he said ""Okay. thats ten bucks"" and i was like ""Okay."" So I gave him ten bucks and he took a book out of his box and said 'what's your name"" so I said ""Tad, but could you use my full name, Thadeus Bartholomew Jameson?' and he went ""shut Up Tad!"" and just sighned it to tad. what a jerk.Anyway the book was pretty good i guess i just wish the writer was nicer you know."
3,Could have done much better...,"Leave it to the Japanese to create such an (apparently) blockbuster with a budget next to zero. It is only 80 mins long and in my view doesn't meet expectations. The idea of a puppet coming to life is not new. It's difficult for a human actor to emulate a robot, and the main female character doesn't do a very convincing job. They all get too touchy and feely and one doesn't have, despite much background noise like whirring and zapping, the presence of a machine here. The substory in a way is much more interesting and realistic, also more erotic. The Japanese Police Commissioner is OOOOHHHHHH. That part redeemed this underfunded and haphazard exercise a little bit."
1,Maid Droid,Peor película que haya comprado en Amazon. carente de guión y sin sentido. Queda por mucho en el intento de ser una película de ciencia ficción o en el peor de pornografía.
2,Too many problems,I bought the FreeStylePro a 1 1/2 years ago. It just stopped working. During that time I was not happy with the water leaking out of the plate & the fact that I had to unplug it when not in use - I would not trust the auto shut off. Like others have said - all the bells & whistles are useless - just need a simple good iron. I will try to contact Braun & see if I can get a replacement.
3,Mamma Roma,"The plot of this early Pasolini is steeped in Italian neo-Realist conventions, but already his style is boldly formalistic. Vivaldi score instead of Nino Rota, languid POV forward tracking shots, snatches of slow-mo, symmetrical compositions that don't come off as simplistic & repetitive a-la Kubrick. Magnani chews up the scenery in her usual way but it works for the character. The movie's high points are the 2 long shots of her walking & pontificating at night on her old whore-street, camera tracking backwards as people from her past join her in conversation & then peel off into the inky blackness. Things fall apart in the last act though, with a pat, melodramatic conclusion and stooopid Christ imagery. Also, I think Pasolini's habit casting of young rough trade that gave him a chubby was creepy. Cinema's Sebastian Venable. 6/10"
3,works but,For the money this is an ok kit. If you want a stable gauge buy a fluid filled one. The readings varied a lot and were useful in finding my problem but for accuracy spend the extra 8 dollars and get a better guage. I ended up doing that.
3,Not for the easily Frightened!,"My husband and I recently decided to begin trying to have a baby. We decided to buy this book along with a couple others so that we could prepare. This was one of the 1st books that I read and after about the first half, I was convinced that I would be infertile and unable to have a baby. Some of the information is very good but a good proportion of the book covers the plethora of things that can cause a woman to be infertile and then all of the latest medical treatments that can help an infertile woman get pregnant. This might be a great book for the woman who has been trying for a while without success but for me, I finished it and was scared to death!"
2,Tough to figure out drivers - not sure it ever worked,"I bought this so I could hook up an older Garmin GPS to my new computer (which doesn't have a serial port). The cable came with a CD-ROM FULL of different drivers for lots of different products - but no instructions about which driver to install. Ultimately, I found a Sabrent driver I thought I needed for this... but still couldn't get my Windows 7 machine to recognize the Garmin GPS and have abandoned trying to connect it. Oh well."
1,"A waste of money, space, and an all out shame to the field.","Whatever you do, don't buy this book. It's even worse in content and execution than Kent Weeks' ""The Lost Tomb"". The writing is shoddy, written is such a dry and frankly unpleasant, all-out boring tone that one gets the feeling the author didn't like writing it anymore than I liked reading it. The plates are rediculous in that none show any attempts at originality--as in rarely shown pieces--and instead reproduce so many things that have already been you wonder why they're there at all. To any future Egyptologists such as myself, I beseech you not to waste your money. Spend it on works by Aldred, Tyldesley, and other notables, not this foolery. One star is still too good of a rating, and I must say I am glad this book was given to me, for I am already shamed by owning it; I needn't add the shame of choosing it."
3,Interesting but not that enlightening,"Yes, this is a chronicle of each Pharaoh of ancient Egypt. However, the book contains multiple grammatical errors and could have done with a good editor. Also, the book appears to be more focused on archeological sites and trappings than a real discussion of each rulers life. As such, it is a little dry on the entertainment side."
3,Part of the long strange trip...,"There's nothing like that homemade, do-it-yourself, garage band sound. I don't remember exactly where I picked this disc up, but when I popped it in the player I was taken back to the days when all of my friends were practicing with their bands. That, of course, was the '80s and these songs are from the '60s, but the spirit is the same. I think a lot of the early punkers would dig this disc, as well as an uncle or two. I'd never heard of ANY of these bands, but I think that's the point. Some of the tunes, like the obvious ""Smell of Incense"", make me feel a time I never lived in. But others, like ""You Burn Me Up and Down"" and the coolly twisted ""Good Times"", could do a little damage on alternative radio now. I don't put this one on the player real often, but it does end up there sometimes. And I would spend my money on the two follow-up discs."
3,"Poor representation of ambience of movie, the ramblings of an... adult.","First off, ""Colors"" by Ice-T aside, the album is a poor representation of the ambience or honest cultural setting of the movie. Where are the oldschool tracks of the barrio holmes.....? IE the Latino / Chicano set of the LA situation.Also, am I mistaken or is the 6-gun track dumbed down? The dudes (or is that a dude) voice is effeminate, and I recall a more macho sound. Probably just that I am now grown.Still, I am always poleaxed by the irony in many of the artists lyrics / diatribe which warn against drugs and gangbanging, but yet result in its glorification. How our youthfulminds filter.Eh.... flashback to the 80s southwestern to national, phenomenonal proliferation of the Crip vs Blood insanity. Still, a bit cheesy and sensational."
2,Disappointing,This 3 CD set contains several versions of many of the songs with not enough variation to be of any particular interest. A good collection of material from the released albums - when are we going to get a new release of Bradley's Barn?!? - would be preferable.
2,Poor smell,"Brand name is very good, but this item was old and smell is already weak, fills as cheapest one. I think it's just out of date.shipping fast, condition good."
4,gives depth to the view of Los Alamos,"Brode gives us a view into the turbulent and fantastic years at Los Alamos, when the atomic bomb was developed under frantic and stressful conditions. There have been several books written about the Project and Los Alamos. But these have naturally concentrated on the technical difficulties, which were awesome, and on the scientific top brass.Instead, Brode shows what it was like for someone not directly involved in the research or engineering, to endure the isolation. Where this was deliberately and stringently enforced due to wartime secrecy. The book gives a backdrop's depth to that strange, wonderful society. Possibly, it is worth reading as a adjunct to the fictional books that have scenes in the wartime Lab. Helps you assess how accurate those authors were in their depictions."
4,Christ and Budha,Ben Kingsley does a marvelous job of orally presenting the message. He provides the essence appropriate for the subject matter. I wish he would do Searching for Peace.
3,"Very good, but repetitive and a bit narrow","Thich Nhat Hanh is a living Buddha. Let's get that straight.However, he tends to repeat his message (often verbatim) from one book to the next. If you know his work, you'll recognize a lot of it here.On the other hand, if you haven't read him before, then this is a good place to start. It is an admirable attempt at ecumenicalism.Another caveat: the Christianity that he discusses is not the sort much practiced. That's his point, in part: it should be more practiced. Fair enough, he's right about that. But he tends to cite the Christian mystics with whom he feels most affinity (Thomas Merton, especially) and ignore how most people view Christianity.In short, if you are a Christian, you should read this book to get another take on your religion. If you are a Buddhist familiar with Thay Hanh's writings, however, you won't find out much about Christianity as it is practiced, and you'll already be familiar with much of what he says about Buddhism."
5,Introduced me to a beautiful world of religion w/o rhetoric,"Briefly, I have read many views on Buddhism and Christianity looking for my very own identity. Thich Nhat Hanh introduced me to the spiritual world of awareness. I have discussed this publication with many of my Christian friends and regardless of any argument that can be put forth, I have to say that Thich Nhat Hanh exudes nothing but love and respect for all religions. This Book will teach you, no matter who you are, a new respect for unconditional acceptance."
3,Mixing blue and yellow to get green,"I am a Christian who has lived in a Buddhist country and therefore understand both religions well. I agree that there are many similarities between the two faiths and that Christians and Buddhists should be more cooperative. However, sometimes in the effort to merge two religions, you end up destroying the unique aspects of each and the final result is a new religion. The author of this book isn't really supportive of what C.S. Lewis would call ""mere Christianity"" nor is he even supportive of traditional Buddhism. Instead of reconciling both faiths, he is really only advocating that Christians and Buddhists adopt Zen Buddhism. There is some good wisdom in this book but it doesn't really support living Christ or living Buddha. It should be called, ""Living as a Zen Buddhist"""
3,Wacoal Women's Feather Embroidery disaster,"Wacoal Women's Feather Embroidery Full Figure Underwire Bra #85121Although I love the fit and lightness of this bra, I was shocked that a bra that was so comfy and light could cause such pain. The underwire is constantly sliding up and out of it's protective covering and piercing the flesh between my breasts. I find this more annd more annoying as no matter how I sew up the openings, the underwire still slips up again. Therefore the annoyance in my voice...with the Wacoal Woman's Feather Embroidery disester."
4,Worthy centerpiece to a Ho-Hum story.,"Thes story picks up were the last one left off. We see the city of Shade moving across the desert and get to meet the shadow wizards. These are good villains, but not as effective as the traditional ""bad guys"" in the realms. There is no Manshoon, Szazz Tam or even Semmemon here. They are a little cardboard at times, and pose little threat to the Realms. Even Telemont, the Shadowmage is not as formidable as he should be.As for the writing style, too many cliff hanging ends to these chapters with characters I cannot really relate too. There are some villainous plot going on here to hold my interest. I can see many hooks for future novels here. Excavations of the Netheril sites, even the revival of Myth Drannor lies within, as the monstrous phaerimm are defeated!"
1,Misleading information,"The product picture clearly shows the complete set of Lifepac which it doesnt. Not to mention my workbooks arrived in a torn box and the books were shrink wrapped and even that was damaged. Keep looking for these from a different source, the price is not right for what they charge and the picture is false advertising"
5,No more pain...,"Iv'e had severe UTI problems for most my life, esp in the last decade. I tried drinking cranberry juice daily but the taste and high acidity is rather difficult for me to stomach. Iv'e also purchased cranberry pills - but the waxy coating and bad aftertaste is not so grand either. I searched online for chewables and found these little guys. They are awesome! Iv'e gone 4 months without a UTI (a record). They are also super tasty (strawberry) and shaped like cute little hearts. The money I save buying Phenazopyridine monthly and absence of the pain and discomfort of reoccurring UTIs make these vitamins priceless! (I'm a bit of a fan)"
4,Excellent Exercises in Abstract Algebra,"Herstein was an unmatched Abstract Math professor, it is amazing his questions are so well designed, where did he get so many well-thought exercises ? they are the best means to digest the concepts in his texts, succint though but very rich in substance. This is only possible if the author has a very profound grasp of the subject.This book is not the latest edition. Some solution books have more questions not in this book. Where to get the most updated edition ?"
5,Great purchase!,This is a wonderful way to watch Downton Abbey ... get the full season ... or 2 ... or 3!.
1,GAY RELATIONSHIP PORTRAYED,"Gay relationship shown. I thought it would be like a Jane Austen novel, but NO! It was interesting up to the gay part, but I don't want to see two men kiss each other on any movie anywhere. I give this warning so others don't waste their time or money on what APPEARS to be a family-oriented movie, but in actuality is totally inappropriate for anyone to watch, in my opinion."
1,Downton Abbey DVDs not complete,Downton Abbey seasons 1 & 2 incomplete..Missing segments..frustrating trying to put things together..Would like refund. Understood this UK version was complete.
3,Downton Abbey,The series itself was excellent....The Season 1 DISC.....had many flaws.....and I really didn't know how to send it back and receive full re-imbursement !!!
5,Beware...it is addicting!,"You will begin watching this with the intention of seeing one episode and then doing something else. Suddenly, you realize that it is 3 am and you can't quit now without seeing the whole season to the end.Love this show!"
1,Lip Sync Problem,"Don't think it is the Disc, something with my Bluray player and my AVR Unit. I now have the normal DVD version and it works fine."
2,Poor Quality,"The quality was not good. I put Disk 3 in the DVD player and when it appeared on my TV screen, it was reading disk 1. There was something wrong with the disks. I believe it was not the original DVD. i would say that it was a copy.The picture on the third disk was not clear and defined. The picture had a blue tint to it. Poor quality. I sent the set back and ordered the original set through PBS - Masterpiece Theater. I will never order anything from Amazon again, except dog training books.I believe there are counterfeiters who list their products with Amazon."
5,Worth every penny and every minute spent watching it!!!!,"The series has interesting characters, is superbly acted and just delightful to watch. I would recommend watching it to everyone"
3,Downton Abbey Season1 & 2,Just received season 3 in the mail. In hindsight the quality of this particular blu-ray is poor. It is somewhat dark and grainy. I am glad to own it because I enjoy the content of the show but now wish I had purchased the seasons out separately. You live you learn I suppose.
4,"Wonderful Box Set - But Missing ""Christmas at Downton Abbey"" , the series finale of Season Two","Everything about this splendid box set is a keeper - with the exception of the missing series finale for Season Two. As the box set credits proudly proclaim it to contain the ""Uncut U.K. Version"", perhaps this last episode (running time of 1:38) was not broadcast as part of the Second Season in the U.K., but as a stand-alone broadcast.In any event, I returned my box set, as it doesn't make much sense to be completely enthralled in the second season only to have to find the finale on iTunes!p.s. I must give Amazon due credit, as they were very quick to respond to my email and issued a full credit to my account immediately."
5,Downton Abbey Seasons 1 & 2,"The series is addicting. The delivery was fast, the item was new. Can't wait for season 3! If you love any story set in the past, and in a different country, you'll love this!"
4,Does it play in US devices?,"Can purchasers of this product (either Blu-Ray or DVD versions) confirm that the discs play without problem in US DVD/Blu-Ray players? The item title specifies that this box set is the ""Original UK Version,"" which from other reviews sounds like it is referring to uncut content of the episodes. However I'd like to make sure there aren't any issues with playing the discs in US devices.I have watched all of Seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix and Hulu and am a huge fan of the series!"
5,My favorite discovery!,"I'm not sure what I expected, but the quality of the writing, acting, location, wardrobe - everything is outstanding. I can't recommend this series highly enough."
5,Downton Abbey Seasons 1 & 2,We got hooked on Downton Abbey after watching the first episode in Season Three. Both my wife and I agreed that we had to have Seasons 1 & 2 to catch up and enjoy the exquisitely written episodes. We now kick-back on a nasty weather day and relax watching a beautiful series.
4,Package damaged upon arrival,"The case for the DVDs were a bit damaged. The damage did not compromise the DVDs, but I would consider more transit worthy packaging."
5,If I could give it a galaxy of stars I would!,"So my husband and I are hooked on the Abbey. Refreshing escape from swearing and slang and slovenly manners. The location is a feast. The script is supper all by itself. The actors make you forget they are acting. Take a vacation without leaving the Lazyboy. Drama, love, sibling rivalry, class warfare, humor. Have a generous helping with your tea."
2,Original UK version?,"Once I watched the first season on Netflix, I was excited to purchase and view the first season again after seeing that I could see the ""Original UK Version"" which means...nothing. It's exactly the same thing unless there is something I'm not understanding about the DVDs. I can't imagine what that is. Anyway, I'm pretty upset, especially since the ""Original UK Version"" is exactly the same thing as what was on Netflix. After reading the DVD packaging, I'm assuming the Original UK version means it has added ""special features""? I would like to know what the ""Original UK Version"" means. I'm not kidding. I really want to know."
1,Throws dust everywhere -,Not apparent from the picture but the shield spins around along with the hole cutter which is made of two pieces of steel that are bent at the ends and a thin layer of carbide grit added. More dust is spread all around the room then using either a rotozip or a hand saw or even an electric reciprocating saw. The blades are not going to cut through the wood or metal lath with a plaster ceiling or through a tongue and groove wood ceiling. No way to limit the cutting depth to avoid cutting into a pipe or wire.It is the kind of tool I would gift to someone I strongly disliked - anonymously.
1,What you pay is what you get.,"I returned it. For the price it's just adequate, I guess I expected more. The padding is real thin and there's only one backpack strap, so when you put it on, your guitar is sticking out diagonally and I keep bumping the guitar into walls and people. Over all poor quality. I'm going to spend a little more and get a better product because ""what you pay is what you get""."
3,Gator GBE-Ac-Bass Bag,Received this product in the time allotted time frame from Amazon. The bag is as described. Not a whole lot of padding. Minimal at best for the padding. Overall inexpensive protection to use on an acoustic bass. Good for going to the lesson or practice.
5,The best cd they ever made,"This is one of my top three cds, ever. And I own over 900.I never tire of this music. It is the echo of my youth and the whisper of my future. ""Then someone sat me down last night, and I heard Caruso sing"" comes from one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs ever written, in my humble opinion. And if you don't agree, that's fine because this disc will still be the one for which I reach on those evenings when I'm not sure what mood I'm in but I do know that I need soothed."
5,Fabulous! Perfect for ALL couples!,I loved this book! I think it's perfect for everone who's ever been in a relationship. It makes a perfect wedding gift or anniversary gift! It's warm and wise. It's great to read together. It has lots of ideas on how to keep your relationship precious. Right to the point! I got one for all my friends and I reccomend the same!
3,First effort not bad!,I enjoyed reading this writer's first book. I liked the characters though not entirely developed but that's easy enough to overlook because the plot held my attention throughout the whole story. I look forward to reading another of this new writer's stories.
5,Compact Collapsible Cook Stove,"This was an excellent buy. Very well constructed and when collapsed, will fit into a small space for transport or storage. Would recommend also purchasing a gas burner although this unit will work very well with charcoal. Should be great for tailgating or when the electrical grid finally goes out."
3,pretty good...,"I used to own this album on cassette. I enjoyed it and listened to it repeatedly, but it wasn't his best work. It is worth hearing, but if you are trying to decide between it and a different work of Sam Kinison I wouldn't reccommend it."
3,"Fun, but terribly flimsy","I bought this as a gift for my daughter - she loves it and has spent a lot of time playing with it. However, pieces started breaking/falling off immediately. I've already had to glue several pieces back together, including re-attaching both of the figure's legs."
2,Chris Rush Returns!,This CD has its funny moments but it is nowhere near his first great comedy album so many years ago called First Rush! If you still have that on cassette or record you are a lucky person! I haven't heard much from Chris over the past 20 years so I was excited to find out that some new material from him was available. If you are a big fan of his you will enjoy this CD very much as it was great to listen to his unique brand of humor even though some of the material was weak. It may not be his best work but overall it was very enjoyable. I just wish they would reissue First Rush so people who don't now much about Chris could see his comic genius!
2,Less than I expected,"I believe a book of this type is needed, but after reading it, I honestly can't say that the illustrations helped; they tended to be just silly, cartoon portraits of the people it covers in scenes where they are yelling at each other. A better approach would have been to use rudimentary diagrams that illustrated relationships and comparison and contrast."
3,Reliable but somewhat disappointing.,"This series, for the most part, appears to be attempting to fill a niche not covered by ""Cliff's Notes"" or the ""Dummies"" series. I had hoped for a reliable, intelligent representation of Structuralism/Post-structuralism along with the levity of humor. I was satisfied on the former account, but not the latter. The cartoons that are interspersed throughout the text are not well-drawn, humorous, or even instructive. Their function appears to be to provide enough blank space to allow the reader to slow down and digest a point before moving ahead to the next page. For the reader who is capable of close, careful, critical reading, any number of introductory texts to the field would serve as well as this. Try also the comprehensive volume, ""An Incomplete Education,"" which gives you far more for the money."
4,"Inspirational, especially for new authors.","How to Write Mysteries is a must for the libary of the budding author. Not only does it offer practical advice, but it offers plenty of inspiration."
2,Not very helpful,"I had hoped that the book would give me a better sense of challenges/issues one is faced with in police academy, instead it consisted of pretty basic concepts of how to study and how to stay organized. The one area that was helpful was a discussion targeted to family members and friends of recruits explaining how difficult academy life is and how they will need to be suportive and patient with their loved one. I really don't feel like I have any better sense of what to expect in police academy after having read the book."
4,Great book for a women's Bible Study,Very useful to launch discussions and it will encourage us all to really think about the many different ways we create idols that dishonor God. It's Gospel centered and points us back to the main thing-our hope is in Jesus.
2,WARNING: MS DROPPING SUPPORT,"MS has officially announced that they are dropping support for this Internet Appliance. How do I know - I got the letter from MS telling me so. I suspect the reason behind this is because the IPAQ is based on Internet Explorer V4 - the rest of the civilized world is predominantly using IE6.0. Unless you intend to hack this device to run LINUX, or use it as a door stop, you'd be better off finding youself a cheap PC such as a SUN JAVA DESKTOP or LINDOWS based machine from WalMart for around $300. Leave it to MS (and COMPAQ) to have the short sightedness not to build in ability to easily upgrade."
3,Not For Me!,"I am a person who has no prior programming.I bought this book with the expectation that I could teach myself the basic material in Visual Basic 2005--I was wrong. I'm going to try another approach with another book or a course.I got to the first project, which I think was too extensive as a starting point. I feel they needed to start out with a less extensive project--a confidence builder.That's my take and maybe I need a Dummy book."
4,"A Great Book for Fun and Education! (A review of ""It Starts with A"")","This is just a wonderful book for young children. There are interesting pictures for the really young, a little bit of poetry for all, and a mind teasing game for older children.Examples:""You travel in this.It begins with an A.It starts on the ground,then flies up, up, away!""(airplane)""This is a candythat comes on a stick.It starts with an L,and it's fun to lick.""(lollipop)My 5 year-old really likes this book, and I like that she has to think for a moment before coming up with the answer. My only recommendation would be to have a 3x5 card at hand. Each page, with it's riddle, has four pictures. The last picture shows the answer. We had more fun (and it was more educational) when we hid that last picture.Four Stars. Its a cute alphabet book for toddlers, and a great fun, `thinking' book for kindergarteners."
1,"Overdone, weak collection","I like Christmas and sacred albums, I have many collections of such music. But this one was really disappointing, Renee Fleming sings in very operatic style, she is wobbly in many places. There was one German song which I kind of like, the Wiegendlied, and Abends duet was OK, but most of this album is very overdone vocally. Several pieces are done very slow, dragged out, others are too fast, like the Mozart Laudate Dominum. I heard many other opera singers in such material and they sound lot better.I found this Sacred Songs collection to be bland and very sugary. The final Amazing Grace was crazy, I did not like it either. If you want a good Christmas collection, get the Christmas album by Il Divo, it has many real Christmas songs. Bocelli's Sacred Arias album is also good, and he sings in a very natural way, very emotional."
2,Bland,"This is such a bizarre collection, many popular pieces cobbled together for no reason. The Amazing Grace stands out like a sore thumb, and Faure and Messiah pieces are completely out of sync.Only the duet with Graham is OK, maybe good for Christmas. My guess is that the label wanted a crossover type collection to cash in on the popularity of best selling acts like Bocelli and Il Divo. Fleming does not have the looks of Sarah Brightman but she tries to imitate her style anyway, with soft singing and mushy diction, in many languages. Her French is particularly bad. Even the English pieces are not very clear, which is just as well, because the lyrics of the Simple Song are so silly anyway. Many songs are sung in strange tempi, very slow or very fast, and embellished too much, but the main feeling is indeed sugary blandness.This album will be waste of money for anybody interested in opera, but some crossover fans may like it, if they can tolerate Fleming's heavy vibrato and very round tone."
4,I love it!,"My, there are certainly some mean-spirited persons inhabiting these reviews...I love this set of tunes. It speaks to me. Maybe I'm just a softy or am mushy hearted - but I don't care. Renee makes beautiful music."
5,Charm and grace,"I'm not a critic, I just love to listen to lovely music. And while I know that this is not ""art"" to those who are huffing and puffing about an operastar recording anything else but Ble Canto, I do love this disc very much. It's uplifting, beautiful and so simple. Renee records music for everyone, not just for uptight snobs. She records ""Daphne"" and ""Rusalka"" unlike stars like Sumi Jo or Renata Tebaldi who record(ed) but the secure warhorses. And like the artists mentioned before she records Sacred Songs. Tebaldi's AVE MARIA was recorded in a similar fashion and I'm glad that Fleming is not above recording ""simple"" music. I am glad that she has the humility, the grace and the charm to make these work and take them away from frauds like Church, Bocelli & Brightman. BRAVA DIVA!"
2,Commercial Yet Beautiful Yet Oddly Bland,"First I will say that I adore Renee Fleming with all my heart and that some of her discs have found a very very special place in my collection. This however will not be one of them. I have a feeling that Renee was slightly bored herself recording this disc of rehased ""sacred"" greatest hits...much like Barbra Streisand's Movie Album this disc is filled with soporific orchestrations and murky arrangements in which the rich, honeyed tones that make Renee Fleming who she is get lost. I would imagine that her record company made her do this disc for commercial reasons.While her voice is amazing this disc is most certainly not. But half baked Renee is better than most could do on their best days so props to her... For good Renee listen to her Bel Canto, and Schubert discs..."
4,Refutation of misleading and ill tempered 'customer review',"As the author of this book, I am protesting for the second time about the innacurate and misleading so-called'customer review' of the work. As I mentiuones some months ago - the reviewer who accuses me of poor research is damnably poor himself. I quoted from Graham Hancock's Sign and the Seal - yet he accuses me of misquoting, claiming that he had read 'Harrison's book'. What the hell is he talking about. Unfriendly reviews I can stomach, after all 'de gustibus non disputandem' - but inaccurate and misleading reviews are anathema.Tim Wallace-Murphy"
3,"Okay, nothing great christmas jazz compilation","It's an okay collection, nothing special. For those who prefer their Christmas jazz to not always be easily recognized and have to focus to recognize the song being covered, there are a few songs like that on this CD. It's not a bad CD, it's just not one I enjoyed."
4,Lots of fun.,"Outgoing Stephanie is sure that she'll get the leading role in the school play. Then, for sure Michael will be interested in her. What Stephanie doesn't expect is for her good friend, shy, quiet Patti, to outshine her. When Michael seems to like Patti, that is all that Stephanie can take! Stephanie isn't sure that she even wants to be friends with Patti anymore! (Grades 4-6)"
4,Make em work a little!,"Good, sturdy little foraging device. My sun conure figured it out and although now he's very quick at it, its something for him to do when he doesn't have his favorite toy (ME!) to play with. I put a peanut in it. I haven't found another one that he can do. The other device I bought is really too large and heavy for him (or else he just hasn't got that one yet)"
3,Not much for the bird brain,I have a 17 yo African Grey Congo. He figured this out in 3 seconds. As long as you put something sticky in it such as peanut butter or a banana it is good for a few minutes of fun but he never plays with it otherwise. And yes a snack or piece of fruit would fall right out when tray is opened. Not worth the price for very little if any interaction time.
5,Hard rock with an R & B flavored edge!!,"Get ready to get your blood pumping! Play your favorite air guitar. If the cat is near by, make sure it's butt is in the air. This band should have made it and it is a shame they are not still together."
3,Eh.,Nothing really special. It gets the job done. One thing I'd say is that the straps are too short to get over your shoulder with one hand. Girls with purses they carry on their shoulders would know what I'm talking about. It is cheap though.
5,Great Product for Gift Giving!,I purchased 10 of these for my bridesmaids for our September wedding. They came in and they are great! They are roomy and just the right size. For the money you really can't beat this product. I'm have them monogramed by a local business woman and saving a ton of money. These are great tote bags and I'll probably purchase them again for my own personal use.
4,Great tote for work,"nice side pocket for an umbrella and two small pockets inside perfect for keys .... good tote size, I wish the handles were longer so I could hang it on my shoulder, but I really like it"
4,"Good size bag, but handles too short for shoulder wear","The bag is a great size for putting all your stuff for the beach or whatever, however, the straps are too short to wear comfortably over the shoulder. If you don't mind carrying the bag, it is great."
5,Great totes,"This totes were exactly what I was looking for. Nothing frilly or fancy, just a good quality tote bag."
1,Smelly Bags,"These bags were a complete waste of money. When we opened the package after receiving the bags, they had a completely intolerant chemical smell to them. You couldn't even be in the same room with them. I had ordered them to use as gift bags for my upcoming wedding and there was absolutely no way we could give these to our guests. We even went so far as to set two of the bags outside for a few weeks to see if we could get rid of the smell, but it didn't help in the least."
5,Brings A Tear...,Wow...I just saw this movie and I just really enjoyed it immensly! I really hope that you would take time from your schedule and watch this movie. It is so powerful and moving that it will bring a tear to your eye.
5,Best football movie,"Radio is the best movie I seen besides Friday.With the best actors in Cuba and Harris,never can't beat a true story."
1,Disgrace,"This review refers to the Theater version of the movie and not the DVD version. It must be that we here in the Bahamas got an unedited first cut of the movie, because in almost every scene microphones were literally hanging visibly over the actors' heads. Cuba was very unconvincing and I am surprised that no one else seems to think so. The only other movie that he was in that was worse than this was Boat Trip. I do not think he can recover from performances like these... BAD MOVIE"
3,just sappy,"I laugh,I cryed, But after the seventh time I said ""aw"" I started banging my head against the coffe table sappy sad good movie but if you'd really rather not commit suiside then I would not suggest buying it renting it borrowing it from a friend or all of the aboveor just plain seeing it period (PS:my head still hurts) and for that reason also (wouldn't advise watching it might hurt yourself)so basiclly if your happy and want to become suisidal don't watch it"
3,Its OK,Radio is a OK movie. Its realy just about a slow teenager who people call radio who a football coach likes and trys to help. Radio has a lot of problems like a death in the family that he doesnt take too well. Theres not a lot of football game scenes even though one of the main characters is a football coach. The actor playing the slow teenager does a really good job.
3,No subtitles in spanish,"The movie has no subtitles in spanish, I didnt checked before I bought it, its my fault. I just wanted to leave and comment as a remminder."
4,4 Stars are because it's SO GREAT to see Debra Winger again!,"Debra Winger. This is really a thankless role but one that is meaningful in a few ways. However, it does show that this particular actress is far more deserving of good roles and should be getting them. How can we fans help? Go see her films."
4,Radio is More Than Just OKAY,"Cuba does a good job of acting here...again and finally. Ed is at his best since ""The Rock"". A true story than pulls itself together at the VERY end. Buy it! Enjoy it!"
5,One of my favorite movies!,"This movie reminds me of Rudy. The difference between the movies is where Rudy had to overcome his size to play on the ND football team Radio is a slightly mentally handicapped young man that does not try to improve himself at all. He is content with who he is. It is the people around him who are improved after meeting Radio and coming to understand his dedication to the local football team is actually an inspiration to the entire community.What the school learned from Radio are the same lessons a good parent should teach their children. Like Rudy this movie will make you stand up and cheer for the underdog. It also will make you laugh and cry, too. Rated PG you need to share this movie with your children ages 8 or 9 and older."
3,Ultimatum,"The first District 13 was so much better. The dubbing was amazing and the action was hardcore. The movie just flew right through and before you knew it, the film as over.This one had real bad dubbing and just wasn't as exciting as the first. I enjoyed it but not enough to rush out and buy it.The action was still good but the feel of the movie was just not there this time."
2,DISAPPOINTING SEQUEL NEVER GETS OFF THE GROUND!,"I was able to see this film in my home as part of a sneak peak preview this month. Luckily I was able to see the original first as if I had watched this disappointing sequel first, I may never have bothered to watch the vastly superior original. The film is bogged down with a tedious plot that only slows the action down. The stunts are still impressive, but it just doesn't deliver like the original film. Too bad! :-("
4,Moving Music,"I have now seen Jeremy Kittel perform live 4 times. 3 times at the local highland games and last night performing with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. If you have the chance to see him live, I would highly recommend it. The music is moving. It is hard to listen to this music without tapping your feet and/or pounding on the table.If you can't see him live, buy his albums they are a treat.I give this album 4 stars because it isn't as good as his first album. However, it is still excellent. Well worth listening to."
2,Too Smooth... More Like Too Choppy,"With a good cast and quirky characters, this movie lacked something in the substance. The characters were a little over done (a.k.a. Disney film) and the story line lacked any substance. It was pretty predictable and I think Ms. Campbell's talents were wasted on this character. If you want to watch a movie just to while away an hour and a half - go rent it at the video store. Definitely not an addition to anyone's collection of ""I bought this movie because I want to see it again and again."""
1,Don't be fooled! This is not 3D!,"Though the producers of this extended music video have created a red/blue product that LOOKS like true anaglyph 3D, it is not 3D. Save your money.9/28/05. I just dug this out of storage and watched it again the other day. Actually only the live footage even sort of looks like red-blue anaglyph and that's probably because of stage lighting! Either the band thought that viewing anything through red-blue glasses made it 3-D or it is simply a marketing gimick.Note to the band: Some inventive video here, but next time use a Nu-View 3-D camcorder adapter (widely available for under $300) and make a REAL 3-D music video!"
5,All 6 of my dogs love this toy,I used to buy this toy at Petsmart for $5 each. All 3 labs and 2 peeks play with this toy constantly. They play with it until it is so gross I have to throw it out and give them a new one. I buy 10 at a time because this has been the favorite toy for all 6 for years and it NEVER gets old. I don't know if it is the color or shape but they are all crazy about it. Each will pick it up and just carry it around in their mouth forever. I am sitting here right now watching my black lab trying to get it to squeek over and over.
4,The One That Worked,"The AV100 is the SECOND video converter I purchased...you guessed it, the first (Brand X) did not work. The Plextor does work as advertised. The software is not perfect, but it gets the job done. Connections with my VHS were straightforward (no TV proved necessary...you see what you are converting in real time on your computer monitor.) The PC connection is USB 2.0; I used a firewire on the front of my PC.All in all, simple, and easy to use, and the price is right."
2,Low Quality Captures,"I had the same problem as a previous reviewer. System capabilities OK, but no settings allow a capture of good quality."
4,"Hardware rocks, software sucks","This is gagdet is doing well in transferring video tape into DVD collection. It is quite easy. But the software that comes with the package is 90% useless. I only use the software for capturing. I use NERO suite for editing, creating chapter, and buring."
4,"Marcus, Marcus, Marcus!!!","This DVD gives a killer opportunity to see one of the all-time best bassists in the world in a live setting. It is a little short and the audio mix is pretty poor (the bass is a bit buried for my tastes, especially because is a Marcus Miller- led band!), but the performances are killer, and it's definitely worth a look and a listen.Kenny Garrett and Patches Stewart both contribute well on their horns, and the keyboardists do well also; Morris Pleasure (who's also the musical director for Earth, Wind, and Fire!) plays great keyboard bass under Marcus' soloing, and the other guy on keys (whose name escapes me!) sure makes some goofy faces, but his solos are killer.And then, of course, there's Marcus and Poogie Bell, who provide a solid foundation anyone would die for.Overall, not the best sound and a bit short, but DEFINITELY worth the trip."
3,Interesting Little Known Story - Worth Viewing,"This was an interesting story that I had not heard about. The film would have been more powerful had the dialogue between the two women was explored in more depth. The connection to Oskar Schindler made the story even more intriguing, but again that relationship should have been explored in more dept. It also would have been more helpful to have more details on the women lives after the war ended and more discussion on how their experience shaped their lives and their views and what if anything the two have done regarding educating others. Despite the lack of depth, I would recommend viewing this documentary."
4,"Mixed emotions, interesting","I wish a sweet story like this could also be told from the African Holocaust. But since it is still going on right now in Africa I guess we have to wait until our continent and all of its wealth is rightfully returned to the African for this to happen. Rise up Africans, rise up!"
1,Rad..NOT!!!,The plot is poorly-developed. The characters are uninteresting & stale. The bike stunts are highly repetitive. The ending is abrupt. The romance between Bill Allen & Lori Loughlin is unconvincing at best. It also follows every sports cliche in the book. The ONLY cool thing about this film are the crashes but it doesn't help the film in the long run. I give this film 1 out of 10.
5,AWSOME MOVIE,"I agree with every one else ... RAD ROCKS and there are probably about 100,000 super suky dvd's out there ... come dvd converter studios ... what's up !!!!!!!!!"
1,VHS to DVD,"My memory of the movie from when I was a kid out shined the actual movie. It's a nice reminder of the overuse of foul language in movies at the time as a measure of coolness. But that's all beside the point, the movie was clearly a dub from VHS to DVD. Audio was very poor and muffled, couldn't catch the dialog most of the time. The best parts of the movie where the start and end."
2,VHS copied to disc,"this old title is rather obscure and I doubt it was ever even formally placed on DVD. The menu screen has a play option and that is about all. The quality of the picture is very grainy and the color often has a severe orange hue. The sound is clear, but does not appear to be in stereo, let alone set up for surround sound. For these reasons, I suspect the title was copied from an old VHS tape onto DVD. Unless driven by nostalgia as I was, I suggest making peace with the memories of this movie and save your money."
4,a little frustrating,"My family has loved this movie since it first came out. I was so excited to see that it was finally in a DVD format. I realized it wasn't a professional copy but took a chance anyway. The quality of the picture is better than I had hoped for but the problem is that the movie stops in midstream. I have to hit the fast forward button and play and the movie continues. This happens a lot in the movie, every several minutes. It is a pain but it is worth it to be able to see the movie again. I bought two of the movies but only watched one so I am not sure if the other one does it or not."
1,My God...........GARBAGE!!!,"The special effects in this movie suck. i Don't even think that they used computers!!!! sometimes when the bikes were jumping i could see the strings/cords that the special effects crew used on them. The scripts had stupid ""one-liners"" and other hogwash imbedded into it. I hate this movie more that god hates me!"
5,Great 80's Movie!,"I remember seeing Rad in the theaters and then renting it almost every week when it came out on video. Cru Jones is the ultimate normal guy turns hero and Bart Taylor is the pretty-boy villian--classic 80's tale of good vs. evil. Rad is the best BMX movie in history and has a great supporting cast--Lori Loughlin (Full House), Ray Walston (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), and Talia Shire (Godfather, Rocky). I was lucky enough to buy a copy of Rad from a video store, but this film NEEDS a high quality DVD release. Please release this movie on DVD, I will personally buy 10 copies!"
5,Rad,"Rad was a movie I first saw when I was between 10 and 12 years old. I really liked the movie and watched it on vhs time and time again until the tape had worn out and wouldn't play any more. It's a great under dog story about a hometown hero who tries to enter a professional BMX race. The stunts alone make this movie a must see. During the movie, he encounters a number of hurdles due to another teams cheating manager. In the end he overcomes the hurdles, gets the girl, and wins the big race. This is a great movie!"
4,Great family watching!,"If you ever saw this series on T.V. then you remember how funny it was. I miss this cartoon and am glad I can now watch it any time I like. My son watches it all the time, and it's good clean fun. I enjoy the humor and antics of all the characters. It's a great cartoon series for adults as well as kids. I give it a ""thumbs up""."
3,Not as good as I remember,"I like many others was thrilled to hear of its release, but unlike so many, I was not as impressed as I remember being when I first saw it. I thought the episodes had funny parts and I remember the references, but it just wasn't there for me this time.If you have doubts about getting it, with the benefit of hindsight, I would say pass. I wish I had spent my money on so many other things than this.Then again the majority did think it was great, so in terms of opinion, they clearly beat me."
3,love that pilot,"The first episode of this show is the funniest one. I haven't seen it in 6-8 years. I think it premiered after the Super Bowl. Jay Sherman is the classic pessimist. His boss is annoying as all hell though. It's somewhat worth the money, I guess."
4,scrapbook kit,Item purchased as Christmas gift for 7 yr old grandaughter. She was excited and has been using it. She loves it.
5,Mandatory listening...,"If you are looking to buy a Dire Straits album, no better place than to start here. This contains all the best songs from their debut up to 'Brothers In Arms'. The songs are predominantly in original studio form and not edited in the case of 'Sultans of Swing', 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Tunnel of Love'. And the one superb cut from the otherwise overrated live album ALCHEMY is included here in the form of 'Telegraph Road'.Its a shame that the last two songs, 'Money for Nothing' and 'Brothers In Arms' have been edited though. For that reason you'll want to buy the 'Brothers In Arms' LP as well. Otherwise a perfect intro to the group."
1,Recipe For Ari Hest,"Take a pretty darn good acoustic solo performer.Add money.Get a record contract.Take his best songs from the last few years and ruin them with overdone, ""modern"" produced sounds and studio tricks.Steal from John Mayer and all the other current male artists.Take away everything that I used to love about Ari,and you're left with a horrible CD.Thanks Ari for making this fan go away by letting them ruin you.Maybe I'll return when you leave your record company and go back to being simple and great. Remember?Sadly,Holli"
1,Save your money!!!!,"This is the worst piece of electronic equipment I've ever purchased. I knew something was wrong when the clock wouldn't automatically set itself when prompted. The first thing to go was the HDMI connection, I switched to an S-video connection and I was getting by, then I recorded a TV show on DVD and it's still in there, I was never able to get it out. All this happened within a month from purchasing."
4,A gift for someone else.,"I haven't watched it, but I bought it for my parents. They seem to really like it, so I guess nothing was wrong with it."
5,CONVOY A BEST TRUCKER,I LIKE TO WATCH ALL THE ACTORS AND ACTRESS AND THEY ARE VERY GOO D MOVIE AND I AM LOOKING TO FIND WHERE I CAN ORDER THE CONVOY VHS FOR MY DAD HE WHO ALWAYS WANTED TO WATCH THE CONVOY AGAIN SINCE WE LAST SEEN CONVOY IN 1980 AND WE WOULD LIEK TO SEEN IT AGAIN AND THE GIFT TO MY DAD FOR HIS LAST WISH BEFORE HIS TIME HE IS 74 YEARS OLD NOW SO CONVOY IS WHERE I WILL NEVER FORGET WITH THE ACTOR KRIS KRISTOFFERSON AND ACTRESS ALI MACGRAW THEY BOTH DID WONDERFUL JOB IN THAT MOVIE AND MOST GREAT TRUCK DRIVER IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD
2,The nadir of Peckinpah's career,"C.W. McCall's 1975-76 #1 hit song ""Convoy"", about a group of truckers united against law enforcement abuse, while very vivid and full of redneck wit, simply could never have made for a very good film, no matter who directed or starred in it. The fact that the man behind the camera is Sam Peckinpah, the man behind such superb and disturbing films as THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS, just makes it pitiful. There's no point to the story. Subliminally, Peckinpah knew it--but drugged and boozed as he was, he never showed his disgust loud enough.Even given the appearances of such actors as Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, and Ernest Borgnine, CONVOY is an unfortunate terrible clinker, the nadir of a director's career. It should be seen, but don't expect anything near the quality of Peckinpah's earlier films."
3,CONVOY,"i havn't played my copy yet. the dvd i got, came from half.com which is a letterbox version, not digitally remastered and released by PACIFIC FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT. i paid less than $5.00 brand new."
3,Not Peckinpah's Best,"Every now and then a song becomes the basis for a movie and sadly, this is one. Peckinpah uses a staple of actors from earlier films: Kris Kristofferson, Ali McGraw, Burt Young. A year earlier SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT set off a trucker movie spree ( GREAT SMOKEY ROADBLOCK, BREAKER BREAKER, et al). It has action and wrecks and C.W. McCall's top ten song. Uncut in this German DVD and in widescreen. Sound is spotty. For people, like me, who are Peckinpah completists."
3,Cheezy Flicks version only!!!,"Here's the update. The Cheezy Flicks DVD version of this is cool yet somewhat disappointing. RE: the aspect ratio and the ""squashed video"", if played on a Plasma or LCD TV with ratio set at 16X9, it shows it in the 2:35 version. Watched on a reg 4X3 TV it is kinda funky looking.(You might want to check your DVD player settings to make sure they are set at 16X9 and not 4X3) Audio and video are mediocre but it does have some cool drive-in movie intermission promo's and stuff. If you have the right size TV and can get it cheap...do it. C'mon though...it's ain't the frickin' GODFATHER! It's CONVOY! I'm suprised it's not a Pan and Scan TV edit."
3,Kinowelt release is DVD-R,"As a rule I'm not a big fan of trucker/chase movies, but I am an admirer of Peckinpah's body of work and 'Convoy' is probably the most artistically realized example of the genre, such as it is, so I wanted to own a nice clean copy. Yes, Cheezy Flicks' two versions-- as discussed roundly here-- are second-rate in terms of video and audio quality, and Kinowelt does offer a somewhat sharper picture (though still grainy and a bit dark) with the aspect ratio corrected, but be aware that the latter's disc is DVD-R format, which generally is considered inferior for repeated viewings and may not work at all in some players. Film earns 3 stars, presentation 2 1/2."
1,convoy,"DVD was for the wrong area, up until this point I knew nothing about areas. Will never buy from this dealer again."
1,Terrible squashed transfer,"Don't be fooled by the cover. This is NOT a collector's edition letterbox edition. The film's original 2.35:1 widescreen has been bizarrely changed to 1.85:1. The result is an unpleasant warped, squished image. It is such a staggeringly pointless and inept thing to do, I contacted Cheezy Flicks for an explananation. They blamed the ""third party"" who supplied them with the transfer. If so, shame on them for selling it anyway. A cynical piece of junk. Avoid."
2,Very dissapointed!,"I mainly purchased this DVD to have an archive of my dad's stunts. He was the stunt double for Ernest Borgnine and worked on this movie for several months in 1977. I am very dissapointed in the sound and picture quality of this movie. ""CheesyFlicks"" lists this as being digitally remastered... I would hate to have seen it before it was ""remastered"". The aspect ratio makes it look strange, it looks like it's slightly out of focus, and there are pops and buzzing throughout. I'm going to keep the DVD only because I want a record of my dads stunt work, not because of its' quality. Maybe the ""Triumph Marketing"" version is better, but wasn't available at the time that I ordered mine."
3,Convoy,"Movie is ok, but not like the movie on T.V. This one is cut and the one that I seen on T.V. was not cut. One scene that was cut from the dvd is where the man is talking to the truckers all down the line as to why they are in the convoy and it shows a trucker mooning the camera."
3,Good Copy for a 1976 Film,"The aspect ratio is in the original format, which seems to be a problem people complained about in my research of this movie. The picture is not DVD quality and can be difficult to see in darker scenes, but keep in mind it was made in 1976. The audio is clear for the most part, but in mono only. I'm not sure, but wasn't this movie released in stereo? To some things up here, I thought this was a decent copy of a movie that was made in 1976. Though $20 is steep for a copy, it's a pretty good copy and I haven't been unable to find an original DVD release of the film ""Convoy"". My research found that the Kinowelt version of the film is the better of the many out there. Just be aware that the seller semicrazy is selling copies of the film, but they are very good copies."
1,Stopped working after two years NO WARRANTY!!!,"Got it from another retailer as part of a bare-bones system in Nov 2007. Gave it to my son for Christmas, after the 30 day must register for lifetime warranty deadline. Didn't know.He assembled it and didn't get things working til March '08 (problems with video cards), and it died in April '10. Tad over two years. He had a busy summer. Didn't figure out what was wrong until late in the summer just before he started college. So it sat on his desk. Dear ole dad started looking for a new power supply in January. Found out that the three year warranty would have applied, but I thought it was only a one year. My bad.Called Ultra and got told they could sell me an upgraded one, for about triple what I paid, but would do NOTHING about the warranty.Great service :(Moral of the story, Register the things right away, and DON'T BUY ULTRA. They don't stand behind their products.Lost a customer for life."
4,Well worth a listen,"Recorded live on the floor, this is a fine album from Lightfoot and the long-time members of the Lightfoot band. Yes, the tracks do sound different than the studio versions fans have come to love over the years. But, if you enjoy the original version of The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald that much, why not buy Summertime Dream? It's one of the best albums Lightfoot has produced in his career. Since Gord has but one live album to his credit, Sunday Concert from more than 30 years ago, I like to think of Volume II as my opportunity to listen to Gord as if he's performing on stage. Unfortunately, there's no tracks from a few of his latter albums including Salute ('Whispers of the North' is a contender) and East of Midnight ('I'll Tag Along' and the title track are both strong cuts). 'If it Should Please You' is a nice treat, but another one or two new tracks wouldn't have hurt. Regardless, here's a chance to hear some of Gord's songs in a different way. Check it out."
1,"For Lightfoot lovers, a giant thumbs down!","Although no "" re-mixes of earlier masters were attempted"" the Gordon Lightfoot Band does nothing to enhance Mr. Lightfoot's voice or highlight the lyrics, of otherwise pleasant songs. The electronics and especially the drums are overbearing and are hard on the ear. Compared to Gord's Gold on a 1- 10 scale, I would rate this a zero...Gord's Gold a 10!"
3,Gordon Lightfoot,"This one is disappointing: Mostly good songs, but the words aren't clear, like he's singing through a blanket. Also the recorded volume is low, bass is weak. The worst is that these songs are not original recordings...Roy"
2,: (,They sent the wrong book to me and it was a hassel to deal with. They refunded my money and I bought the book else where. No phone number provided so when dealing with my return everything was through email with made the process take longer.
4,Decent product,"Probably won't last too long, but they get the job done!Inserting the negatives is also kind of difficult, but I still recommend these!"
2,Does not have binder holes as shown in description,The reason I bought these was because it shows binder holes and archival quality.The strips are thin and there are no binder holes so I have to put them in a folder which defeats my whole storage system. If I weren't so busy I would have returned them.
2,Disappointing -- Certainly Nothing Special,"Le Carre for me has always been a wonderful challenge -- a difficult-to-read, disjointed writing style balanced by his mastery as a storyteller. This is the first book of his for which the annoying outweighed the pleasurable. Clearly this is meant as wicked satire, and indeed it is, but the heavyhandedness of the points he makes is grating. Every single character in the book is either amoral or incompetent, or both -- seemingly bent on self-destruction. Le Carre spares no one -- if I were Panamanian, Jewish, black, Indian or Japanese, I'd be offended at the insulting generalizations he heaps upon my people. World-weariness is one thing, but Le Carre writes with the ultra-cynical tone of a man who needs a rest. This story of post-Cold War spies manufacturing a war seems to be a metaphor for his predicament as a writer. On the plus side, no one does the clipped British speech pattern like Le Carre -- Osnard's annoyed ""hell's going on's"" are classic."
1,Leave it on the shelf.,"""Panama"" has the momentum of cold maple syrup. The story's location and Le Carre's name drew me to the book. But after reading it, I wept for my lost time. The main spy, Osnard, lacks depth; his background is revealed way too late in the story. Le Carre fails to legitimize Osnard as a cunning, capable spy. And it seems the reader should care about Panama's plight & the Canal's future. Yet the characters who own the passion & grit to fight for their Panama were obscured in the plot. What's left is a wimpy tailor with a past who's desperate for cash. And when I realized all of this, I still begged for something to happen. It just doesn't. For intrigue, momentum, and competent characters, try Ken Follett's work (favorite is ""Triple"")."
5,Attention Getter,"My five year old son is very bright, and I find it difficult to buy him games that hold his attention for very long. Music Buddies is one of the few exceptions. We've had it for a while and he is still glued to the video a few times a week. He is enjoying himself and learning music, numbers and how to participate all while having fun. Sometimes when one of the Music Buddies mades a mistake Mrs. G the music teacher says, ""Thats all right, everyone makes a mistake sometimes"". It has been very helpful for my son to learn that mistakes are normal and everyone makes them. There is so much to learn from Music Buddies and I highy recommend it to any parent! Its wonderful."
1,This DVD [stinks]!,"I've seen this episode before. Buttercup and Bubbles mess up Blossums hair and she looks ugly. That wasn't really funny. All the other episodes here are just as stupid! Whoever created this show TRIED to make a Super-Hero adventure, but failed miserably. It's pathetic really. Avoid all PPG DVD's! They are not funny and are a waste of time. TRUST ME!"
2,Do you more harm than good.,"Why do you think this book is out of print? Because it'll screw up your tennis ability, especially your forehand.The sad thing is some of the tips are good. But Vic didn't know how to hit a ball. If you watch his video you'll realize he's a lousy player. He doesn't understand the basic of hitting a forehand.You may improve a little if you're a new player. But it'll do you more harm than good in a long run."
4,a bathing beauty,"With a nod to France and the French Patisserie, Laura Mercier introduced a body and bath collection called Body and Bath Collection Gourmande featuring such scents as Au Lait, Creme Brulee, Vanilla Creme Puff, and Tarte Au Citron. Sound delicious? They are, plus no cal.The Creme Brulee Honey Bath is a favorite with its delicious caramel cream fragrance. As if that weren't enough for a bubble bath it's also fun. The Honey Bath comes with a wooden honey dipper. About six inches long the dipper isn't a spoon but has a serrated tip which you twirl to pick up the Honey Bath. Then hold this under running water to fill your tub with masses of rich bubbles.The addition of Vitamin A and E serve to moisturize and condition the skin while Rosemary, Thyme, Lavender, Geranium and Honey provide a lovely fragrance.Smoothing on Creme Brulee Souffle Body Cream following a bath is the ultimate in pampering and pleasure."
1,Do not buy this baking sheet,"I bought one from our local Boscov department stores for $1.99 since it is so cheap, I bought one and tried it out. I just put a few cookies on it and stick it in the toaster oven at 375 degree. After 5 minutes, it smell burned rubble. I took it out; the sheet was bubbled up in some place. I was so afraid of the cookie might be contaminated so I dumped the cookie and the sheet in the trash can. Well I better keep on using my Silpat baking liners which are expensive but work very well. I like to give 0 star but amazon does not offer 0ne."
1,Disappointed,I have a 8lb Maltese and there wasn't enough room for her. She wasn't comfortable and it was not stable enough for her. I put her in a regular backpack and I put it on backwards then we went for a bike. She was more comfortable in that than the Pet-a-Roo. I will sent it back and keep looking.
1,Please!,This is the worst excuse for a book I have ever seen. I bought it based on the other reviews and boy was I spoofed. Who in their right mind would give someone a little bag of grain as a gift? Or buy rice noodles and wrap them in a paper towel and think that someone would find that unique. Cookies that look like they were decorated by a 5 year old in a paint can - really? I found absolutely zero value in this book and assume the other reviews were from personal friends. Thankfully I didn't pay full price or I would be asking for my money back. I am extremely disappointed to say the least. You can find far more creative ideas on the internet for free.
1,A soulless goodbye,"I was so disappointed when I first got this album. Their earlier albums were so great. Then I got my hands on this stinker. What happened? We know these guys have talent. Where did it go? To me this is soulless pop music. They hide this blatant immersion into pop, with the facade of art. Vague lyrics and quirkiness doesn't equate art. Instead it's just that, meaningless. This CD was the first in step down a slippery slope for what was a great band."
4,Solid performance,"REM is pretty much the exemplar and paradigm of American Underground rock. They've pretty much gone the distance and stayed the course as far as rock bands are concerned, having been around for over eighteen years and are still releasing albums. In this case Green is one of their earlier albums, but that hardly means it isn't worth listening to. While many bands tend to experiment with disparet sounds and styles, as if they suffer from some sort of dissociative syndrome and can't connect with whom they really are, all of the songs on this album bear the distinctive stamp of REM's sound and style. While the non - rock historian and the non - REM fan may find little of interest here, most fans will find this an enjoyable and entertaining performance."
2,Skip this REM effort ...,"This is the second REM record in a row that disappointed me. I like 3 songs -- World Leader Pretend, Orange Crush, and the untitled Academy Fight Song. Many of the others are throwaways.Stick to Murmur, Life's Rich Pageant, and Automatic for the People."
5,"Every time I hear this CD I want to ""STAND"" up and dance!","This is my absolute favorite CD. I love REM so much and this CD is awesome. I love almost all the songs on it which is hard to do for a whole CD. ""Get Up"" is my favorite song, and ""STAND"" I call my happy song because it puts me in such a good mood. If you're thinking of buying this CD... do it! I haven't gotten sick of it yet and I listen to it all the time."
2,"""Being There"" revisited","I purchased the DVD to have it in my collection of films worth owing. I enjoyed the film even more than the first time I saw it. A good book and an even better film. It does not happen often. However, the quality of the DVD is very poor indeed. Every so often the picture stops, then it defragments in little squares like a Cubistic painting. I am not sure that the DVD is an original or a copy of the original.Even the wrapping and the picture on the box seem suspect."
1,Junk,Very disappointed in this movie. Guess I didn't research enough. Trusted someone else on this one. Watched about 7 minutesand put it away. Will probably end up in the dumpster. The language was very disappointing. Bought it mainly because it was filmed at Biltmore (which I am a passholder and just love this place). Was told it was a very funny movie. Couldn't watchit long enough to see if any of this was worth it. It started very slow and just never became interesting. What a waste oftime and money.
5,Awsom,"The masterpiece of a very special actor/person that will be remembered as one in a kind.Still a lot of controversy by a very particular end, that invites viewers to seriously think about it and/or life itself."

5,super,"a subtle farce on what to the movie viewer is obvious,but not to the rest of the world of power. I loved it. containing a germ of truth throughout the farce. I found it to be engaging and funny i found MacLiane disappointing. overacts, i trhought. all in all one of his best but very subtle. especially the very end."
5,classy accessory pack,The case is durable and good looking. The headphones I like better than the default ones that came with the Zen Vision M. Get this pack with your Zen.
5,"arrived on time, and in quality stated.",as new quality dvds. slight wear on cases but was mentioned in description. recommended for those who love good eats and are on budget.
3,"Good book, but price is steep.","I purchased this book at one of Mr. Anderssen's classes (at a reduced price). It does have many interesting recipes, including things like foot deoderizing powder. The cookie and other baked good mixes are interesting, but many do call for ingredients (like vanilla powder) that are not readily available in your typical grocery store. Many of the recipes also require the recipient of the gift in a jar to add a lot of fresh ingredients...which in a sense diminishes the ""gift"" effect. I believe some of the proceeds from the sale of the book go to charity and that lessens the impact of the hefty price tag for this small book."
5,"Excellent, essential tool for corporate communicators","How the heck *do* you spell the name of that ice cream company? In my job I have to write to a lot of companies and need their spellings at my fingertips. Not surprisingly, Webster's doesn't list any of them. This book has become a staple reference tool for me.(Believe it or not, a lot of companies spell their own names WRONG on their web sites!)"
5,Industry standard,"These are the real deal! They are the highest quality slide pages I have ever used, in fact they are the only brand I have ever used. Nuff said"
5,A Superb and Thorough Work,"This is a book for anyone doing supervision in a mental health field. It provides a much needed and innovative approach to supervision and includes material on strategies, diversity, legal and ethical considerations, role of personal values, evaluation, and disruptions to the supervisory process. There is a wealth of information and resources to enrich every level of supervision. It can be used as a text or for reference and contains excellent tools in the appendices."
3,Gaul warriors for the beginner modeler.,"These Gauls are pretty neat, though some of the poses they were made in make them look less fierce and more funny; one guy is nude but I just threw him out. Also the sheilds can come off easy but not if you have a strong glue. On painting them, they are fairly easy and the shields already have designs on them so you can't go too wrong in detail. Easy to assemble and would be good if learning of ancient European tribes."
1,How disappointing!,"I absolutely love the movie Shag. The main ingredient that makes me love it is the music. I popped the video in the VCR and sat down at my computer.... When I scrolled down the page to see what songs were on the CD, I thought I had the wrong movie soundtrack. I was looking for ""Alley Oop,"" ""Stagger Lee,"" and ""Mama Said."" They aren't there! How can someone get away with releasing a soundtrack to a movie that doesn't even include the songs that stand out and define such a wonderful movie? Something had to be done about it!"
1,No good!,"Wow, I have loved this movie since it first came out, and while watching it recently I thought I must have the soundtrack!! I am so disappointed that none of these songs are played in the movie. How is this the soundtrack!? :("
1,MISREPRESENTATION!!!,"I am new to Amazon and only wish I had read the reviews BEFORE I ordered and listened to this CD. Sure, the price was right, but there was not one single song from the movie. How can it be called the original soundtrack?? How can it be from the movie Shag without 60-minute Man, Stagger Lee, Are you Ready, etc.???I have learned my lesson and I will never order again without reading the reviews and checking for a list of songs!!"
1,AHHHHH!,"I was 11 when I first saw Shag. I have spent practically ten years tryin to find the soundtrack to it and it is a complete disappointment! I mean who can forget when Malana made out with Jimmy Valentine? Or when Pudge, Malana, and Luanne tricked Carson into going to Myrtle Beach? Without those great songs like ""Alley Oop"" and ""Let Me In"" we can never remember those great moments!"
1,Movie a BLAST!...Soundtrack a Disappointment!,"After viewing ""Shag"" I was compelled to purchase the soundtrack. Disappointment was mine when I began listening to it. It was hardly comprehensive. I didn't recognize any of the songs (good, as they were), they just weren't up to par. A listener only has what he or she hears to go on, and the catchy tunes from the movie drives them to wonder, ""Could I own these most wonderful songs?"" Sorry pal, find them some other place."
2,Shag sound track CD,"The CD itself was in good shape when it arrived, and played alright, but the plastic case was in about 4 pieces. I paid over $40 bucks for that thing, and expected everything to be as new for that money. You can close my Amazon account."
1,Original Soundtrack my ...foot!,"Where are the songs from the movie? They are certainly not on this CD. (Are they available somewhere else, I hope?!) These songs have nothing to do with the movie that my daughter and I are madly in love with!"
2,I found the Jakki O Song,"If you're like me, and looked forever for the Ooh Aah song, well look no more! I found it on ""Art Laboe's 60 Killer Oldies"" and on Jakki O ""In the mood for love."" Both are available on Amazon! YEA!"
2,"great movie, lousy soundtrack","I adored the movie, and haven't been able to figure out all the songs that were in the movie but not on the soundtrack (since the soundtrack omitted most of the best songs), but here's the best I could come up with (for those of you who want to find the songs through other sources): Mama said; Monkey Time; Since I don't have you; Let Me In; Stay; Another Saturday Night; He's So Fine; Easier Said Than Done; Alley Oop; Baby Work Out; 60 Minute Man; Stagger Lee.I would LOVE it if someone has a better / more complete list - I still can't figure out what some of the songs are."
1,What's up with the Shag soundtrack?,"I recently purchased a new copy of ""Shag"" the movie and found that the songs used were different from the original version of the movie. Did anyone elso notice this? Why can't someone produce a soundtrack from the original version of the movie and include songs like ""Stagger Lee"" and ""60 Minute Man""??? Please!!!"
4,A So-So Soundtrack,"I actually bought this soundtrack for three songs: ""The Shag,"" ""Ready to Go Steady,"" and ""Surrender."" I really cannot understand others who complain about certain songs being replaced. I'm a huge advocate for using period music in period movies and I love the new stuff in here! It sounds like it could have come right out of the 60's. What better song to open a movie called Shag than a song called ""Shag""? It's fun, dance-able, and it captures that young, free, teen feeling of the 60's. It's a much, much better opener than ""Mama Said"" by the Shirelles. The only real problem I had with this CD was the cover art. How much time could they have spent on making that? It's horrendous! My only wish for this soundtrack is that one day it will be released in it's entirety (with that very fabulous Jakki O song). However, until that day this soundtrack suits me just fine."
3,Love it but broken,So I absolutely loved this as a gift for someone who loves Weber grills and has everything. Unfortunately one of the lids was broken and I had to return it.
5,great product for saving and organizing negatives,"When you outgrow digital photography and start shooting film you will need a way of protecting and organizing your negatives. This is a great product, the sleeves are large enough to accommodate negative strips (on some brands the fit is a little too tight and it's hard to slide the negatives into the sleeve), and the plastic is archival. I've tried several brands and like these the best."
2,Calphalon Large Spoon,"I'm not very excited about this spoon. The handle is really too long for me, and is too flexible when trying to dish up hot food. I would not recommend it."
3,Hellboy,"I went to the theater and watched the movie last night. It started out interesting enough and I thought it was great that Ron Pearlman finally got a lead role in a movie, and I also thought it was a great cast for him. ""Hellboy"" is a very interesting character to watch onscreen & examine. The problems arose by a weak plot that leads to the inevitably predictable ending. While I thought Ron Pearlman did an excellent job in his role (aside from some weak script points that were beyond his control), the other characters were flat, unbelievable, and impersonal. In addition, there a long lull in the middle of the movie in which the plot does not progress significantly, there is nothing visually exciting onscreen, and as it turns out contributed very little to the overall movie. In the end, ""Hellboy"" will probable make it to my DVD collection as a popcorn movie, but from judging from the old ""Hellboy"" comic book from Darkhorse, it should have been a lot deeper than a ""popcorn flick."""
5,Excellent film,Great casting. Good plot. Oustanding special effects and character makeup for Hellboy (Ron Pearlman). A must for action film lovers. Buy it!
3,Ugh. Wait 'cause there's gonna be a specialer edition soon,"I really enjoyed Hellboy. I have been reading the comics since they started, and this film does a great job capturing their gothic feel. Also, Ron Perlman is Hellboy; absolutely perfect, in fact.BUT, from the director's commentary on the deleted scenes, we learn that in a few months an extended version is going to be released. del Toro has said that this release ""is for the fan of the movie; the second will be for the collector.""Get this movie, but wait to see what the specialer version looks like in a few months first."
3,"All right for a comic book adaptation, I guess, still needed something","I haven't read the comic books so I can't judge them, I bought the DVD mainly based on the TV spots looking interesting. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (never read that comic series either) was a mess as a movie, Hellboy was much more entertaining. I didn't quite get the reason for Rasputin (in the comic maybe?) but the storyline mostly made sense in a comic book sort of way. Ron Perlman was good as Hellboy- best part of the movie in fact, Rasputin's tomb was WAY too big. It seemed obvious to me that a sequel was hoped for, I've read that one will be out in 2007."
3,"Hellish! Oooh, goody","Big grouchy-face Ron Perlman as a reluctant superhero summoned from the outer reaches of hell by the Nazis? I mean, how could you not like ""Hellboy""? True, the sucker is flat as a wafer and could've done with a Gary Busey cameo, but still... Del Toro manages a similar trick here to the one he pulled on ""Blade 2"", conjuring up a comic book spectacular that's simultaneously deeply crappy and oddly loveable. No fab FX - in fact, nothing particularly memorable at all - but, Lordy, give Big Ron a few choice quips and a big red rubber mask the size of Odin and you've got a winner. Tip: they do here."
3,Alright flick,"Hell boy was a good movie but had WAY to much FX which kinda got me into bordom but an alright flick. Between Hellboy, Spider man, The punisher and Van Hellsing I cant choose which movie will do great. But this movie was more of a c+ for me.I hated THE ENDING!!! I wont spoil it though. This movie had great looking monsters. I havent read the comics but it looks good though. I might check it out. The movie had lots of huemer. Lots of action, Lots of fx makes this an alright flick.Over all its a movie you should check out."
3,"Good film, but doesn't excell","Ron Perlman effectively carries this film when the plot mechanics bog down the story. He's funny and violent and vulnerable, perfect. If he doesn't work, the film doesn't. One thing that I disagree with about the film is that it shouldn't be rated pg-13. There's a lot a violent and gruesome content in this film and it's combined with occultic themes, kids shouldn't be seeing this stuff, that's all. I had the same quibbles with the Lord of the Rings, they pushes R rated violence into the pg-13 territory because they wanted to make their money back. Enough of my puritanical rant, I just feel that this movie earns the R and doesn't end up getting it, that's all. By the way, kudos to Jeffrey Tambor, who plays a character who you don't like and is still OK to like at the end because he's such a obnoxious dufus. To all who've seen it, I hope you stuck around for the credits to catch a little bit more of him."
2,Dull,"Hellboy is your regular comic book action movie with fight scenes that involve too much CGI. Wasnt enjoyable, more like eye candy."
4,pretty good,"This movie is pretty good. Entertaining enough- not one of my favorite Marvel Comic movies, but it's alright...better than Dare Devil..."
5,incredible,"I just wanted to say to amazon and hastings I'm really happy with my purchase. I just ordered hell boy I this sunday I got it today 11/17/10. The cases are good and the dvds are not scratched up. This is pretty much why I keep ordering from hastings so much. From the bottom of my heart, thank you..."
4,Better than I expected,"When I sat down to watch this DVD with my boyfriend, I definitely was expecting it to be horrible. The beginning was a little slow, but that's because I'm not into stuff involving history. I liked the humor of the character Hellboy, and if you're going to get the movie, I definitely recomment the Director's Cut. Well worth the money."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Overlong (this refers to the Director's Cut) and poorly-structured, Hellboy coasts for a while on the considerable charm of Ron Perlman but ultimately collapses upon itself; I love Del Toro, but found Hellboy to be a movie long on imagination and short on storytelling technique."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Hannibal was a pretty good movie, but the whole time I had the feeling that there was something off about it. Anthony Hopkins was simply amazing as he is in most everything he does and The rest of the cast was equally as good, but the story was a bit strange. Out of the four Lecter movies, this is the one that just doesn't fit. I didn't like the whole overseas aspect, although the manhunt was Lecter was pretty good. Clarice Starling was a completely different character in Hannibal and it has nothing to do with that fact that another woman was playing her. Juliana Moore did a great job, but Starling, wasn't the same Starling we came to love in Silence of The Lambs. She was reckless and honestly not as smart as the Starling we all know and love. Overall I liked the movie and it had some great parts to it, especially the ending, but it really doesn't fit the genre of what we know about Hannibal Lecter."
4,Playthings for Foxes,These items very much served my purpose of having a somewhat realistic decoration of a small pond. The foxes who frequent my property occasionally upend them as they do whatever they do in my my pond (night time activity). The delivery was prompt. Just thought mailing charges were somewhat high.
1,This is not a travel guide !!,"Buying this book was a complete waste of money !This book does not tell you anything about present day Jerusalem. It's all about the history of this city, and how jews and arabs live in fear because arabs are afraid the jews would demolish theire homes at anytime, and the jews are afraid of potential new bombings.It doesn't contain ANY information about where you could stay, eat or even shop or go sightseeing ! it doesnt even include a single map, besides the fact that it is absolutely boring and full of mistakes."
5,The best of classic TV,"I have always been a big Barney Miller fan going back to my college days. The good old days of late night syndication. Two hundred cable channels later, Barney Miller remains on the missing persons list. Chances are if you're reading this, you are a fan and have already learned that they only did the one season, which, as everyone knows, was the worst. This show took awhile to find its stride, but don't let that dissuade you from buying. For starters, it's a whole season of Fish - who departed the show shortly thereafter. Like everyone else, I am left scratching my head why they haven't yet put out the other seasons on DVD or at least begun airing them on one of my cable channels!"
1,A tepid romance,"I did not enjoy this book at all. With the exception of a pig and the brother, the characters were very boring and I did not care what happened to any of them."
2,"Well written, but.....","extremely uninteresting. Oh, how I hate to be in the minority on this review page, but I read through the book in a constant state of ""what the heck?"" There was no romance in this story. It was a military saga. And the main couple had absolutely no time on the page together until 3/4's of the way through the book. And don't even get me started on the loss of her virginity in such an unexpected manner. Like I said, ""what the heck?"" Maybe that should have been the title because there were no roses present."
4,Great Reading and a Fun time,"I found this book by accident and started reading parts of it, and then could not put it down. There are just so many things that make you think the Author followed you around, and knows the story of your life. I would recommend this anyone to discover more about themselves. Whoever Doroty Mc Coy is, I hope she keeps writing."
4,Entertainment only,"Its okay for entertainment only, I wouldn't put much stock in the self-discovery. Its fun..."
1,Bad - confusingly Bad!,Funny to some but aggravating for me. I like a definitive & a direct communicator in movie characters. This movie contains neither and rambles on and on and on .......! Ugh!
1,Wrong Book Sent,"The company sent me the wrong book. I ordered ""Lord I want to be Whole"" and they sent me Lord, Heal My Hurts""."
3,Nice cables,"Nice cables, but each time I tried to connect my Zune to my plasma TV, I was not able to get a clear picture. I tried it on several other TVs with the same result."
2,Sloppy Presentation,"This compilation is unworthy of Paul Simon. The sequencing makes no sense. The 1977 album, 'Greatest Hits, Etc.' is better. Unfortunately, that album is out of print. I miss 'Stranded in a Limousine' and 'Take Me to the Mardi Gras.' The Graceland songs are great, but they don't fit in with the 1970's songs."
5,fast camera,"This is a great camera. I had read everything on the other SLR cameras and this seem to be the best bargin. I use the point and shoot mode and I thought some of the pics may be bad, but after seeing them I was amazed at the quality. I thought for sure that the fash was too small but the pics turned out great. I still have to test the super fast shutter speed and the bulb mode. I like the bag that comes with the kit. This is better than our Pentex SLR. I am happy."
5,...MY FIRST FEATURE...,"Well...I wrote, produced, directed, and acted in this film...and all I can say is...it was a hoot. Can't wait to release the next one.Q"
2,ok,"Was very drying, didnt make my feet soft, smelled good but was more of a wash needed a lot of the product to make bubbles overall not good product"
5,Penn State History-A Classic,This was a tremendous victory for the Nittany Lions. The contrasting styles of Miami and PSU made for an interesting battle.It's great to relive it.
2,1/2 Price = 1/2 compatability,"Upon arrival and opening the box I thought I was going to be pleasantly surprised. The DreamGear is a near replica of the iMainGo2Go...of which I've purchased 2 in the past. I use these speaker cases for my son's augmentative alternative communication device, as he is non-verbal autistic. Specifically, we use an iPod touch along with the Proloquo2Go application. Unfortunately, the DeamGear IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH IPOD TOUCH OR IPHONE!!!! Really!? What's really funny is that it says on the outside of the box ""compatible with all ipod models."" NOT. So, basically I would recommend this for all people who are looking at an iMainGo2Go for non iPod touch or iPhone uses."
3,NOT for iPod Touch 3rd or 4th Generation.,"I bought this for my non-verbal, vaccine injured son. He uses the iPod as an AAC device for communication. iPods traditionally don't have great sound output. I found this at half the price of the imaingo speaker box. The package clearly states "" For All iPods"". Well this is simply a false statement as it does NOT work with the touch. However, I did plug the iPod into it and the sound quality appears to be very good. But with the protection factor of not being able to enclose the touch it only does half the job. It appears as sturdy as the imaingo, but again when the touch can't fit into it it's hard to tell."
3,Fleetwood Mac Greatest Hits,"I got a used disc. I only paid $5.19 for it. You get what you pay for - it only played once, then broke my machine."
3,Makes it easy to slide chairs and other furniture,"I bought these to replace the pads that I installed in the past on a set of dining room chairs.I'm using them on ceramic tiles with fairly wide, rough grout, so they tend to wear out in a year or so.I can pop off the worn out sliders and snap on the replacements. (I don't use the mounting hardware, asI had already installed those.)The included nails are not the best way to attach the sliders to chair legs. Vibrationtends to loosen them. And, on a narrow chair leg, it's important to drill a pilot holeto prevent splitting.Instead of the nails, I use small wood screws and enlarged the hole in the mounting hardware."
1,Where's the Fire!!!,"I looked forward to receiving the latest offering of Agatha Christie read by Hugh Fraser. My expectations were high because of former recordings by the same reader. When what to my wondering ears but Mr. Fraser sounded as though he were announcing for the Indy 500. The actual speed of his voice was normal but the spaces between the words were excised, leaving a veritable jumble of crushed words clusters which could not be understood much less savored.I checked with my sister who is an avid Christe on CD fan who thought that her CD's were being read by Daffy Duck.We are both thoroughly disappointed in Audio Editions of ""Dumb Witness"" and ""Murder is Easy"""
4,second time around,"Good Times, second season seem to deal with more issues that are real and part of everyday life."
2,Pickover's worst book to date,"Actually, this effort can not be appropriately called a book. It can be more appropriately described as a collection of random thoughts.When Pickover tries to really dig into the problem he posed to himself, his efforts end up either being shallow or degrading into rumblings about mathematical formulas. No significant advance in the matter is ever reached.Almost all of his premises can be seen, by any mildly intelligent person, as false from the beginning, which turns any effort in reading through the entire book a Herculean task.I have read almost every book Pickover wrote to this date and enjoyed them very much, which prompted me to buy this one mostly because his name was on the cover... Suffice to say that I won't be making that mistake twice."
5,Great Drive - Awesome price,I haven't had any problems. Works as expected. Price 89.99 is really a good deal.
3,Good Bang for the Buck but not 250gb,"the hard drive is great and runs fine and fast, easy to install just plug and play but it is ONLY 232 gb not 250 even though it is advertised as such and the box it self is advertised as such."
3,Only 232GB,I just received the pacake from Amazon. Coonected it to my laptop and the drive shows 232GB. I know there will be space used for the Hard drive software.. but 18GB ? Even windows installation is not that much...Lacie does not seem very loud. Looks OK.. The USB cable is short.One advantage is that it takes 110-220V. good for travellers.
2,Bricked.,"It's strange to believe I spent $120 on a 250GB hard drive, but that was the price back in 2005 (?) when I bought it new. I needed something to back up my PC and store extra files (especially videos), and this looked mighty fine.And it worked mighty fine for a while, too, until around 2008 when it completely shut down. The hard drive used to be quiet, and I liked the off/on switch, but after a while noise built up until it finally stopped working. It still turns on, and computers can recognize it, but it's completely locked with no way of retrieving the files within. I consider myself to be somewhat computer savvy, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out what was happening. I had a few friends with more knowledge than me take a look, and they couldn't figure out what was happening.I had to redownload everything (and thankfully I had all my family videos/photos saved in another drive) and I purchased a Western Digital when I got my new Mac. So far so good."
1,Avoid,I own numerous external hard drives from different manufacturers. Each of the 3 Lacies that I own have stopped working. Don't risk losing your files by purchasing a Lacie.
5,It works well! EXTERNAL HD,"IT REALLY SOLVED MY PROBLEM OF SPACE!Easy to use, small and compact. A really good buy!"
1,stay away from Lacie hard drive,"I owned 2 Lacie external hard drives of different models, which includes this product listed. Both of them failed after 1-2 years of normal use. Their hard drive quality is definitely weak. As for me, the product failure result is 100% and around 450 bucks are gone with wind. I'll never purchase any Lacie hard drives."
3,Average selection of music where better is available.,"I was not impressed with this collection. I do not think that David Byrne has a great enough knowledge of Brazilian music to put out an album of the right songs. For beginners, I would highly recommend ""Best of Brasil"" and work from there."
5,Great debut album that is sure to please!,"If you are a fan of Jack Johnson, Sublime, Slightly Stoopid, Pepper, or anyone else along those lines, Bag of Toys is another band you'll be adding to that list. I discovered the band through a friend of mine and bought Nooner the very next day. Their laid-back acoustic sound and rich (and often relatable) lyrics make their music perfect for a nice relaxing listen, be it by yourself or with some friends. Their sophomore album Afternooner delivers the same great tunes; I highly recommend both of their albums to any fan of the acoustic surf-rock genre."
4,Fascinating story,"The interesting thing about George Harsh is that he wasn't an innocent man. As a teenager he took part in a murder; then he served years in a Georgia chain gang. He got out in time to join the RAF, get shot down, and serve more years in a WWII German POW camp. His life was difficult, but he writes with a certain maturity that must have come from long years of hardship."
4,My boys love this!,Ordered this for my 2 and 3 year old boys obsessed with trains. Fun rhyming book that is appropriate for younger kids. They love reading this and pointing out all the different toys represented in the pictures. They are also in to counting objects on the pages. Recommend.
4,An exciting album that grows on you.,"I first heard Ofra Haza's singing on the sound track of ""La Reine Margot"" and shortly after ""The Governess"" and I sat up and took notice. I had often heard of her, but prior to Internet shopping, had never been able to find any of her recordings in the local stores (if it ain't honky tonk and bluegrass, to bad!) It is a great pity that she was not better known in the US. At first I was a little put off by the loud rhythmic beat, which sounded to me like someone banging a tin drum, but on the tracks where we can hear the singer above the accompanyment, Ofra Haza is stunning. I would recommend this and other recordings by Ofra Haza to all those who think Charlotte Church can sing."
4,A nice family movie,"It is too bad that this film didn't get a wider release, because it's a very nice story and a nicely made movie with a talented cast. I had a chance to see it at a film festival and my husband enjoyed it too, even though this is not his typical kind of film (no shooting, no kung fu). It is filmed in San Francisco and is a story of a brother and sister who have lost their parents - the brother (played by Jason Behr) is drifting and the older, responsible sister, has gone in the opposite direction, throwing herself into a successful business career, but constantly having to bail out her brother. There is a bit of a magical element to the story, too, when the sister hires a 'fairy godmother' to look after her brother and tries to straighten him out. Among the cast is Jorge Garcia, who plays one of Jake's buddies (and who went on to play Hurley on 'Lost'). Give this film a try and I think you will enjoy it!"
1,Misleading Title,"First of all, the word ""Introduction"" in the title is misleading. It is assumed you already understand set theory because the ""review"" at the beginning is skimpy at best. You'll need other references to back this book up. Secondly, there are no answers to any of the exercise questions. Combining this with the skimpy coverage at the beginning, the student is left to his/her own devices for arriving at the correct answers. Answers to some of the exercise problems would have been extremely helpful for a student studying after hours--especially with a subject like this."
1,do NOT buy this book as an introductory text!,"i am currently enrolled in a course for which this is the required text and have found this book to be all but totally useless. this is the first semester the text is being used and the professor has already decided to switch textbooks for the next semester. i am placing an order for michael sipser's textbook in hopes that i can still salvage my grade in this course. in summary, this book is a waste of paper, both literary- and money-wise.i hope this insight is useful to other undergrad students who are in the same situation."
4,Given moderate set theory background this is superb intro,"Given a moderate background of set theory, this is an excellent introduction to the subject. There are full rigorous proofs of everything, along with very verbose and helpful explanations of key concepts. The first two intro chapters try to help out the symbolically impaired, but personally I think it would be too little for the rest of the book. There is real logic and math when necessary."
3,Just Okay,"well, the story is nice and kinda sad too, but not too sad. I guess it just a mattter of pride, with the conflict of Aaron's ego and Claudia's stubborness. anyway, it's enjoyable story and great cover too. (so, who is the cute guy?)"
2,Could have been better,"I agree with God's Son ""God's Son"" comments. The cd was not as the previous Mississippi Mass Choir albums. I was waiting for some praise and worship but what I got was songs I can sing in church with the musicians. The songs was not effective to me. I like track #1, 2, and 5. Hopefully there next album will be better. MMC DON'T GET TIRED YET!!!"
4,It Had To Grow On Me,"I am not going to lie. When I first bought this album, I really was not feeling it. It took me a few times of listening it to it over and over again to get use to it. I have to agree with previous reviewers, the songs do soung like Georgia Mass Choir rejects and it is not their normal style but they sound a lot better than the Georgia Mass Choir. The Songs I really love are One More Day, The Next Time Wil Be The First Time, I'm Not Tired Yet, When We Get Up, Victory Shall Be Mine, But By My Spirit, and Place Called There. These songs just really take you to church. I had taught my choir 3 songs from the album and my pastor and church just loves them. If you are looking for some hand-clapping, foot-stomping, holyghost filled music then please purchase this CD."
5,"Short of Shakespeare, excellent fare","If you looking for Shakespeare's contemporaries (or if you are adamantly against Shakespeare and looking for some other good English Renaissance plays), this is the book for you. It has good footnotes for all the plays and the intros are well written. It includes Marlowe, Webster, and a lot of other playwrights as well; the plays that are collected are several and thoroughly wonderful. I recommend reading the intro and bookmarking the dramatis persona page for recall (these plays have a lot of characters). Overall, great book, which goes well with any Elizabethan or Jacobean class you might be taking."
4,Very useful,"A good bit of time can pass between learning the form in the dojang and practicing at home. The techniques and stances that you thought you wouldn't forget become fuzzy, and this DVD is very useful to have so that you can practice the form correctly and not have to re-learn it when your errors come to light in class. It also provides more than one camera angle so you can see the techniques all the way through the form."
3,Informative about Tibet. Easy read.,I selected this book as my book club pick because of other reviews and because I wanted to learn about Tibet (and the Tibet/China issues specifically). The story was an easy read - 9 of 10 book club memebrs enjoyed it. The love story was not told with emotion as it was a third person telling but it was colorful and easy to relate to in many ways.
5,Cool series,"It took forever to arrive, but it was well worth it. It was my mom's all time favourite series and I like it too."
2,These work okay,"I bought these because I wanted very badly to breastfeed my daughter but we were having latch-on problems. I was told that nipple shields could be helpful for this.I went with the Avent because overall, I am super impressed with their products. I only use their bottles and pacifiers and have been a happy customer in the past.I don't really recommend these specific nipple shields. I can't get them to stay in place and they are really akward. My daughter dislikes using them and I can't get her to nurse with these.If you are in the market for a nipple shield, go with the Medela brand ones. Those are much easier to use and less akward for baby."
3,It's ok...prefer Medela's shield,"I disliked using a shield in general, and fortunately was able to get my son to latch at 4 weeks without it. He finally started gaining the right amount of weight once I got rid of it so if you can avoid using these completely, try to...they can hinder the nursing process causing baby to not get enough milk.If it is absolutely necessary for you to use one, this works fine. In fact, our lactation consultant prefers this one because it exposes more skin. For me, though, it was more difficult to use because it didn't stick or stay in place as well as the Medela version. I'd imagine it is a complete matter of personal preference, though, so it's worth trying if you are struggling with the other."
2,It melts !,"After a few saute and stir-fry, the edge of the spatula and and handle melts on me.........disappointed."
5,"Following Gods guidance, wherever He may lead...","This book provides you an opportunity to know about the lives of Chuck & Donna Thomas and their wonderful work at Project Partner.Chuck & Donna went through a lot, took tremendous risks (personally and financially), and accomplished so much in furthering Gods Kingdom. This book is a great document of the eternal legacy of their work following God's leading by stepping out of the cookie-cutter approach to missions we have traditionally known.Moreover, this is a testament to the extraordinary things that God can do through ordinary people who will listen and follow His guidance, wherever He may lead... even over ""mountains""."
4,A good outline of Black church history,"This is a good foundation. Since the first slave ship arrived to the USA, we have been active in our liberation. As to the previous reviewer ""a reader"". It always amazes me how muslims can put down Christianity when they do NOTHING in our communities but talk tough. Please read YOUR history and learn that when the europeans came to power they used the slave routes of muslims who were the first to enslave continental africans(which still goes on! BTW, the koran is an edited book that has been rewritten several times. At least read your own history before speaking on others. PEACE"
1,I am Actually a muslim and I want to give my opinion,I would like to say something about christianity. For centuries white christians have surpressed and enslaved other races or religions.Why would I want to convert myself to a religion that didn't even have laws that inspired people from all races and beliefs to live in harmony and friendship.One advice.Read de koran:You won't be disappointed About the book then.Does the author even now that the Bible during the roman occupation was forged(just like the juish book the thora)
3,"Fun, but son lost interest quickly","My son didn't play with this for long. He played with little boat and pirate more than the base, but overall it's not a favorite."
4,Long Live the Chivalry of Blue Knight,"The hearts and souls of gallant knights and disarming ladies beat in this music! The lyrics are enchanting poetry that catch you as quickly as the irresistible rhythms. An interesting mix of instruments and vocal style lends old world flavor. The melodies of ""Always, ""Think of Me"", ""Celebrating You"" and ""Share the Light"" are unshakable. This CD expresses James Gilchrist's shining heart of gold."
2,IT'S OK,"Spent the first hour cleaning all the parts, as I was unpacking the box it came in. ( pieces of styrofoam sticking to everything in the box ) It's not that sturdy and it had a couple of dull spots in the finish on each side. My wife made use of it, I don't think it's worth the money."
2,well???,"this product is not what I expected. I was hoping that my daughter would like to help me bake...... well she was afraid to touch the mat, especiall when my fingers were burned by it. I did't like how it worked."
1,Most terrible piece of garbage ever made!!!,"Being an Edgar Allen Poe fan I rented this trash because the title is Edgar Allen Poe's, The Raven. The movie starts with a girl, named Lenoore, killing her rapist by throwing a blow dryer in the tub with him. The rest of the movie is everyone who seems to be associated with the girl including her dentist being stalked and killed by this guy who has evidently resurrected for some unexplained reason. Sound like Edgar Allen Poe to you? Let's move on from the plot to everything else. Terrible acting, lighting, and sound. No entertainment value whatsoever. Not even so bad it's good or funny. Just bad. I rented it but wanted to burn it just in case some other poor sucker made the same mistake."
2,Low wicking performance,"I tried these filters. Well priced, well made, shipping was prompt. But if you are looking for the same water wicking performance as the original filters, don't buy these. With original Sears filters my humidifier empties itself every day (8 gallons). With these filters, more like 2 to 3 days. So if you want a lower output, great. If you want more moisture in the room, these just don't do it."
4,A helpfull review for the laity,"This would be a bit of a hard read for the average person, but as a thoughtful Christian I am tired of having my faith ridiculed and belittled by the pulp fiction end times literature. It is unbelievable to the thoughtful person and obviously not true to the thinking person. What does the bible say is sometimes difficult for the lay person to determine. A scholar, Dr. Hill has explained the biblical view on the subject in a way that I could understand. I can continue thinking like I have always thought and not feel that I am wrong as so many try to convince me that the popular press is representing a biblical view. If it were, then my entire faith would be shatteered because my God is much bigger then the God portrayed in the pulkp fiction to which I refer. Thank you to Dr. Hill for his helpful review of Biblical End-times comments!"
2,Liberal Assumptions,"I understand this book is intended to be a summary for a general audience, but it assumes a number of conclusions that will be jarring to the ordinary Christian in the pews without much explication. Some questions in my mind:- If Revelation was written over 30 years before 2 Esdras, what would that mean for the theory that Babylon is Rome? Perhaps the usage of Babylon for Jerusalem in the Dead Sea Scrolls might be relevant?- If the 70 weeks of years in Daniel is purely symbolic with no objective meaning, why did so many people in 1st Century Judea believe the Messiah was about to arrive? Why do the 490 years line up so well with Jesus' birth?- If Paul didn't really write Ephesians, why does ""Paul"" promise to send Tychicus to the Ephesians on his behalf? If it was written late in the 1st Century, wouldn't the Ephesians know Paul was already dead and he couldn't send anybody?Finally, can Professor Hill address these questions without calling anyone a ""fundamentalist""?"
1,stay away from this product,"I purchased this product after being a faithful listerine user for decades. I had been looking for an alternative to the high cost of whitening in a dental office. from my first time using this product i have experienced the peeling of the mouth so many of you are explaining. i have followed the directions to the letter, tried using it with several different toothpastes and get the same results. it feels like blowing a bubble gum bubble but with your own mucus membrane...which is gross if you ask me. I even once blamed my coffee creamer, throwing away a whole quart of 1/2&1/2 somethings just not right with this stuff and if you ask me its time we all step back and ask ourselves just what exactly is going into consumer product today. remember, supply and demand fuels the economy.....if we demand it theyll supply it. is this what we have been demanding???"
1,"Dread ""Pizza Mouth""","After following the manufacturer's directions ASSIDUOUSLY four times (morning and evening for two consecutive days), I felt those strings of skin hanging from my pallet that are usually associated with the burns one gets from too-hot pizza (""Is that cheese, or is that me?""). I tried once more and discovered that the inside of my mouth was actually PEELING. This product should be taken off the market."
1,We have to suit this company.,"I recently bought this item, after two days of use (I noticed since the first time but thought was something else) I felt how my gum start to peel off and my tongue had some black spots ( I have pictures ) just after 2 days of use. I dont recommend this item, it doesnt says nothing about the peeling of gum in the Facts sticker, its not even listerine is alcohol with something else... be careful."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I, along with what seems like many others, have experienced weird side effects from this product. Gross discoloration at the back of my tongue, the so called ""black tongue"" appeared after about 2 weeks of use. I just hope it goes away."
1,Buyer Beware,After using the product per the manufacturer's recommendations I have had the lining of my oral mucosa peel off. My mouth is now sore and taste has been diminished. I only hope the reaction is temporary. Obviously not everyone will have this reaction but I would definitely say that even a small chance of having this side effect is not worth any cosmetic benefits. I will be writing to the FDA and consumer protection agencies.
1,"After Three Days' Use, I have a Permanently Salty Mouth!","I used this product AS DIRECTED 2x a day for four days. I had the same gross peeling mouth experience others have reported here, but that ended after two days.It has now been more than a week since I discontinued use, and my mouth is permanently salty, no matter how much clear fresh water I drink. (I thought I might be dehydrated, but that turned out not to be the case.)This product should be takenoff the market! I am amazed that it did not need to get ADA approval."
1,Bad Stuff!,"I loved this product at first... The foaming action really made my mouth feel so much cleaner, and my teeth did seem whiter...I then starting getting this disgusting'SLIME' in my mouth, and my tongue looked like it was growing cotton! My throat also burned... I didn't relate it to using the Listerine and thought I had 'thrush' or some other mouth disease! This really scared me and I was going to make a Dr.s appointment! I stopped using the Listerine HOPING that might be the cause... Well- wouldn't you know it! My mouth soon returned to normal! I felt sooo relieved! DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT! Your membranes inside your mouth will peel off! It actually makes your mouth DRIP goo! GROSS!!!"
1,Didn't work for me at all,"I used this stuff consistently and as directed for for almost four months. It had absolutely no effect on the whiteness of my teeth. My teeth aren't excessively discolored either; just the normal amount of discoloration that a 26-year-old would have. Nevertheless, this product did not work for me. It tastes okay and I'm sure the peroxide kills germs, but after using it for a long time and not seeing any results, I can't recommend it for its intended purpose."
3,"I share symptoms, but I'm not sure I can be mad at Listerine.","Haven't really used it long enough to give a true rating....I've also had the peeling gums thing after a few days of using the product, but having had oral sensitivity to other mouth washes, I really attribute it to my own reaction to the rinse. For every bad review on here, there are probably a lot of people who have had no problems. It was helpful to know that others have experienced the same thing, but I think I'll hold off being totally PO'ed at Listerine. Hydrogen peroxide is potent stuff. And having done telephone work, I just want to say that whoever you get on the phone when you call the company would probably face legal implications if they tried to diagnose your mouth problems. They're probably just clerical staff."
1,Black Tongue Cha Cha,"Really, trading slightly whiter teeth for a black tongue is not worth the trouble.I have a terrible taste in mouth, a stained tongue that looks like cha-cha dancers have done a once over in the middle of the night...Not for the faint of heart!"
5,A must-read book for a parent of a gifted child. A great resource!,"I found this book to be the most useful book I've read on the topic. It provides a very clear understanding of the levels of giftedness, the examples of actual children of all levels and the appropriate educational environments for each level. It has really helped us to understand more of how our son learns and served as a guide in our school search for an appropriate school.Dr. Ruf has really done a great service to parents by writing this book. Thank you!"
4,Good guide for the basics,"Thanks for turning me on to compost tea. It has revolutionalized how I now garden. More good tips in here as well.Compost Tea Making: For Organic Healthier Vegetables, Flowers, Orchards, Vineyards, Lawns"
2,Limited Scope of Information,"I bought this book because I'd read that it walks you through your first grow. That's true, if for your first grow you plan on spending several hundred dollars on expensive lighting and hydroponic systems. If you want to learn how to grow using CFLs or soil, you're out of luck - they're not even mentioned. Nor does it tell you what items you might be able to build yourself instead of shelling out for. Basically, this book doesn't tell you about different ways you can grow, it only shows you one (very expensive) method.In addition, it's poorly edited. There are several places where a word is missing or misspelled, and at least one paragraph that was printed entirely in the wrong place - the heading is ""Exhaust up through the attic"" and the paragraph below is about light reflectors.I've found more useful information for free on grow forums than I have in this book."
5,Love this book!!,"I gotta say this book is excellent. Easy to read, easy to comprehend, and just makes the process of growing cannabis seem simple. Am hoping our present administration will help to decriminalize a very misunderstood and unjustly demonized plant. Well, I'll keep the faith and wait for that day. If i could suggest 2 other books, they would be ""Cannabis: A History"" by Martin Booth and ""Legalizing Marijuana"" by Rudolf J. Gerber. The book by Gerber is a bit repetative, but I liked the insight, especially since Gerber is a former judge and points out the history of failed drug policies. I'm just a few pages into Booth's book so far but I am enjoying it so far."
1,Very Disappointing,"Such a simple concept which is in essence - ""Make a list of things to do"" ""Decide when and how to do them""Explained in such away as to make anyone dizzy, the book is the most poorly organised I think I have ever seen. The author never wanting to use a sentence to describe something when a page of words will do.If you really treasure your time please do not waste any of it with this book."
2,Don't be misled,"If you're into '60's spring break for a laugh or a flash back party, get this video. If you are a die hard Grand Funk fan, get this video (which is why I did). If neither, pass it up. The video of Grand Funk at the end is great, and was worth the money to me when Mark Farner took off his vest. To quote one of his later songs, OOOOWEEEE! ( gave it 2 stars, but I'll give that scene 5 stars)"
3,Help for a broken wrist,I had a bad spill and broke a wrist. The PT used a paraffin bath. It helped so much I bought one to use at home. It makes your hands warm and supple so that you can stretch and bend your hand without too much pain. Now I use it all the time to make my hands and feet soft.
3,Takes Too Long and Is Too Big,"The HoMedics Paraspa is simply too big. The minimum amount of wax you need to use is three and one half pounds. Wax only comes in one pound blocks so that means you have to use at least four pounds. Using four blocks means it takes forever to melt. Had my unit plugged in for over 7 hours and not enough wax had melted to submerge my whole (very tiny) hand(s).The assumption is that you will always keep your unit plugged in. There is no OFF button. It must be unplugged or put on the ""warm' setting.The wax solidifies quickly.If this unit was simply smaller and functioned on less wax, it would be more practical for home use.I like the wax treatment but I regret having spent the money since it is impractical for me to wait hours and hours for the wax to melt and I have no intention of always keeping the unit plugged in.Also, wax gets way too hot for kids."
5,The BEST Bible Songs CD For Little Ones!,"First, I absolutely LOVE Twin Sisters and I own other CDs by them. This box set is fabulous...just as I expected! My daughter is five months old and I wanted to find a way to incorporate praise and worship into our day. This CD box set is ideal for intoducing little ones to God and the Bible while experiencing the joy that comes from celebrating His love through music. The songs on these CDs are Sunday School favorites, hymns, and ones that I am just learning. The voices are sweet and melodious and the songs are fun and upbeat. My daughter smiles every time she hears the music start! You won't regret this purchase and you will find yourself seeking out more music by Twin Sisters."
1,HORRIBLE,Do not buy this product. It blistered as soon as it touched the pan. I notified customer services and have not heard anything!!! I been mislead.
1,Worst DVD ever made,"The other reviewer says it all. There is literally nothing on this DVD. How to hold the cue and how to make the cue ball go forward, stop, or reverse upon making your shot. Again, nothing about angles, that is where to hit the ball in order to send it on an angle to the pocket. After watching the first drill and the second drill performed on all 15 balls, I fast forwarded thru drill 3 and 4. Then he goes into some trick shots. How about real game situations, even an overview of rules/how to play a couple of variations. You can all laugh when I tell you I paid $25 at the local store for this. Going right into the trash."
1,Unhappy customer,"I purchased the ""I Love You"" basket for valentine's day for my boyfriend. It was total garbage. All of the snacks were stale, I mean everything, the popcorn, the cookies, and the cheese straws. I was so disappointed, and was really embarrassed. The cellophane wrapping was even ripped..............I wish I could get my money back....."
1,Can't recommend,It's very difficult to get line into plastic mesh of the slip on leader. Then I used a heat gun to shrink tubing over the pair but the leader came off during fishing. After 2 tries I give up. Good idea but the shrink tubing grip is too weak.
3,Practical astrology but not outstanding.,"I found this book interesting, but not very deep. I thought it could have done a whole lot more on personality tendencies. I thought the most useful aspect of this book was that it teaches not everything is ""set in stone"" but a tendency to be aware of should its influences give rise. Other useful information was his sporadic explanations between the basic tenents of receiving for the sake of sharing and receiving for self alone. I found his lack of references or a bibliography disturbing given that astrological concepts have been around for quite a long time. How ironic that Kabbalah takes Solomon's teaching of "" there is nothing new under the Sun "" quite literally. Regardless, I don't think this book is a waste of time, but I don't find it as something I'm going to be coming back to frequently, as the word astrology inherently implies. I think a good perusal in Jungian theory or Meyers-Briggs will benefit a reader much more."
4,easy to assemble and sturdy,"We bought this toy for our grandsons. It was very easy to assemble and seems to be very sturdy. The hand hold that slides through the neck is a little wobbly, but I don't think it can come out. The only thing that I would change is to put a small stop of some kind on the rear end to keep the kids from sliding off. It hasn't happened yet, but we watch them pretty close."
5,Love this rocking horse!,"Bought this for my one and a half year old son. He loves it and rides it every day. His is pretty short and I wondered if he would be able to get on the horse by himself but he does it just fine (after a couple days of practice!) Made of solid wood, this rocking horse is very durable. My five year old also likes it and loves to rock with his little brother. Easy to put together, as well."
4,Puzzles and Essays,Tough puzzles but still a lot of fun. Will last me a long time. Puzzle pros will be happy with this one.
1,Europe-warning,"I am not an electrician. But would still like to buy electrical products. Therefore, there should be disclosure of that product not readily usable in Europe. I've doubled my purchase price in order to make my iRobot serviceable in Denmark."
4,Works like a dog!,This product works very well. I purchased it actually for indoor use as I have alot of pethair and kitty litter on the floors daily. The others just did not really do the job. Dirt Dog does but.................it is a bit noisy so I put it in a room and close the door till it does the job while I am at home.
3,Not worth it,"What no one tells you is that it takes 30-60 minutes to clean one room because it needs several passes. Honestly, I'd rather just vacuum for 10 minutes than hear this thing bump into walls over and over and fumble its way around the room for an hour. It's doesn't even clean that well. I will be returning mine."
3,Nice while it works.,"My Dirt Dog was my third iRobot vacuum/sweeper product. All have failed despite careful maintenance and cleaning in periods of about 3 months (Dirt Dog), about 10 months (if I'm remembering correctly) and a little over a year. I would suggest viewing these more as entertainment than a long term cleaning solution just because they WILL fail in relatively short order based on my experience. They are great for cleaning pool tables, by the way.An advantage of the Dirt Dog is that it is cheap. I can't imagine what people who pay multi-hundreds of dollars for Roombas must think of iRobot.You should be able to find my other iRobot product review (with update) on this site."
4,Touchy Little Dog,"I have two other iRobot products: a vacuum and a mop. I liked them well enough to try this puppy out in my garage. I bought the docking charger and the scheduling remote, too. The ease of good and good engineering is not quite there. The Dirt Dog self-docks only after a few tries. Programming is a bit tricky. You have to stand in front of the docking station to block its IR signal in order to use the remote(!?) It often got itself stuck behind a bicycle or something else. However, as far as automatic cleaning goes, it does a great job. It picks up dust, litter, leaves and most small stuff. Emptying the hopper is a cinch--much easier than on iRobot's other products. You have to clear the floor of LOTS of stuff, or the machine can't reach places, knocks things over, or gets stuck. Still, you have meaning to clean up the floor anyway, right? So I recommend the product, but you have to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the machine."
2,The dog doesn't like dog hair!,"I love the concept, and it was nice not having to sweep twice a week, BUT... I have a big long silky hair dog, and within 2 weeks the vacuum was out. The hair got tangled in the wheels that you can't remove to clean. It's in my closet, taking space. I am looking for a roomba that will do the job even with long hair."
2,2nd ones a dud too,Within 30 days of purchase the 1st one broke...now this one has broken in 90 days. Great customer service...but what's the point if you have to replace it constantly.
4,Dirt Dog,"I am very pleased with my new Dirt Dog. I live in Ecuador in a house with tile floors and I have two dogs who shed constantly. We also get a lot of insects (scorpions and beetles) and the Dirt Dog cleans them up nicely. I am puzzled as to why IRobot doesn't sell them here- they are missing out on a good market. My neighbors love to come watch the ""Dog"" perform."
5,Salvation from Siberian Fur,"I had a regular iRobot that worked fine for the first few years but then I rescued two Siberian Huskies and their fur killed the motor. I bought the Dirt Dog thinking it was for dog hair and not realizing it was for workshops. It was wonderful! It works very hard and picks up all the hair and dirt -no filters to clog. I have wood floors and it works until they are barefoot clean! My female keeps an eye on it and makes sure all her fur is picked up -the male ignores it and sleeps through the cleaning. Great product if you have shedding dogs and wood floors! If you skip a week and it has to pick up a good amount of fur, it may need to be cleaned durign the cycle but it's very easy."
1,Don't buy,"This product was okay for a very limited time, thenit quit working. The battery died and wouldn't recharge and I did everything right, by charging the battery before I used it and plugging it in right after use.Poor investment"
3,The battery sucks,"This is my 3rd iRobot product. Needless to say I like them. I also knew that the battery on them loose effectiveness very fast. Now, with this model it was even worse. It does the job, but almost in installments. After a month or so, the battery was not lasting more than 20-30 minutes."
5,Ghost Towns & Mining Camps of New Mexico,This is a very interesting and entertaining book. It fills in the blanks on areas that I have seen and/or heard about. The stories that are included are very entertaining as a bonus. Really fun reading.
2,Ok would not purchase again,The paint that comes with this set stained several of my daughter's outfits that are now ruined even after washing right away. Buy crayola washable paints instead. The paint cups are cute everything else I wish I would have purchased separately by another brand. I would return this set if I could bummer.
4,Fun educational toy...,My father bought the easel for my son's 2nd birthday...he did not realize the companion set had to be bought separately which was a disappointment...I bought it for him and he has used it a lot since we got it...I recommend parental supervision using it as it can cause a huge mess for 2 year old..older kids would be fine...
2,Disappointing - would not buy again,This was our 4th Melissa and Doug easel we have purchased for our grandchildren. The quality was very disappointing and probably should have sent it back (arrived dented and the holes not drilled in proper place for assemblage). I will not buy another.
5,Great companion,Great companion to the easel...only problem is the marker....difficult for little people to use as the point has to be pressed quite firmly against the white board..purchased a replacement at local office supply store and my granddaughter had much more success with it.
4,Painting is always a Blast,My daughter loves to paint and I love the spill proof paint containers. She is a bit of a spill princess:) Highly recommend and comes with everything. I use with a little tykes art easel.
3,Paints do have a strong chemical smell,"I had read some reviews of this before I purchased the set and they said that the paint smells strong. It does say non toxic, however that is really hard to believe after I took a whiff of it. I love Melissa and Doug toys but I am not impressed with the paint for that reason. Other than that my child loves painting and using her easel. No regrets there."
4,paint isn't washable...please comment if you've gotten it out.,"So I like the product overall, but I would have separately bought crayola products since they are (mostly) made in the USA. My husband bought this for our daughter for Christmas and we used the paint on a photo shoot to paint my pregnant (with twins) belly. It went on smooth, though we haven't tried it on paper. SO the problem is that I can not get the paint out of my clothes, specifically the blue and green. Here's what I've tried: Shout, wash, and sun dry. Oxyclean soak for 10 hours, wash, sun dry. Neither of these have worked. So all those who have said that this paint is washable, please hit me up for some ideas on how to get this paint out of my shirt. Thanks!"
3,Didn't fit my face,"With the glasses touching my face, the nose bridge didn't quite fit. I donated the glasses."
4,Powerful Intelligent Drama About Being Black In America,"A riveting small little film that packs a punch. A drama about a black man in the South trying to survive and become self aware. It is sensitively filmed and all of the performances are great. It is a shame that it is not more widely known for it has a lesson in it for everyone. One critism though, it lacks humor, and in life survival can not occur without it."
4,A Good One!,I enjoy old movies. I saw this one on television and had to have it! The price was within my budget and there were plenty of copies in stock.
2,Unrewarding,"The narrator walks along a Boston street thinking about his friend / rival, who he's going to dinner with. I thought the format of the monologue -- essentially the narrator interviewing himself, switching between ""I"" and ""you"" and changing his ""I"" story in the face of unsympathetic and well-informed questions from the ""you"" questioner -- had potential, but nothing about the actual content grabbed my interest. I gave up after 33 pages. At least it only cost me 1c..."
5,Character IS story!,Great insights based on entertainment value and sound human psychology. Best point: Make your characters DIVERSE with many interests that give multi dimensionality and life to your actors.
2,Forgettable,I really hate to say this but I've tried and tried to get through this book and can barely make it past one page. I find the writing to be a painful work-out. Interesting how a book on creating unforgettable writing is so forgettable. I hope others have better luck reading this than I have!
2,Sorry,"Sad to say,I agree with ""Thin"" and ""Forgetable"". Probably worth the $1.06 used price... maybe. Such a difference from Seger's earlier book, ""Making a Good Script Great"", which I liked very much.It seems like such a rehash of the obvious, after which we get painfully detailed exposition about what, for example, ""Conflict is an essential element of almost all fiction writing"" means (p.92). Do we need examples of conflict dialogue ? Maybe??I am not a novice screenwriter, so maybe I'm being too critical, but I have not learned one thing from this book. Sorry Linda."
3,Creating Characters,"It's a decent book when it comes to learning about building character. Some of its insights are sort of common knowledge where as other can be found in superior script books that don't focus exclusively on character (McKee's ""Story"", Trottier's ""Screenwriter's Bible""). The book is from 1990 so many of the television references aren fairly dated. Seger also has a tendency to let quotes from other writers do all of the heavy lifting. The book would strengthened if Seger infused some flavor and a voice of her own but instead the pros are fairly dry. A decent supplemental book on screenwriting."
3,This is no Supertramp,"I am a big Supertramp fan and while this is no Supertramp I am amazed at how you can get this sort of intricate sound from just two people, so I would guess that some of it is pre-recorded (but I could be wrong). Overal it's not bad, pretty much the comercial side of Supertramp and missing the raw vocals of Rick Davies. Sound and picture quality is good. One thing it did do, was inspire me to go and get Supertramp - The Story So Far which I had been dodging because it is only in 2 channel stereo but it is actually very good. Kia ora from New Zealand."
3,Mixed Feelings...,"I have mixed feelings about this concert. The ""voice"" is there, so it is enjoyable listening to the Supertramp songs, but without the band, something was missing. Unfortunatly, it's the only Supertramp concert available on DVD."
4,Roger Hodgson - 'Take The Long Way Home-Live in Montreal' (Eagle Rock),"Good sixteen song gig here by the voice and talent behind Supertramp. Only downside of this 2006 DVD is that 'Live in Montreal' turns out to be a Hodgson solo performance. Had there been an entire band here, I would have given it a five-star rating. Still, good to watch. Sort of like a PBS special - which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Many Supertramp gems here, like ""Take The Long Way Home"", ""Give A little Bit"", ""The Logical Song"", ""Breakfast In America"", the tear-jerker ""It's Raining Again"", ""School"", ""Dreamer"" and ""Logical Song"". I didn't recognize several of this title's tracks right off hand. Guess I need to dig out my old Supertramp cassettes - if they still play. I'm thinking I might have gotten just as much out of a CD release, if this DVD is available on audio CD. A nice pick."
3,"Great watch, poor materials","The watch mechanism works wonderfully. Keeps time very well automatically. The problem lies with the materials it was put together with. The band is fine in stainless steel, but the problem is with the resin in the case. The small parts that hold the band pins to the case are made of resin, which breaks. In fact this is the second casio wave-ceptor I've had with this problem. The resin on the case that held the band pin broke causing the band to not be able to attach to the case, rendering the watch a pocket watch. Oddly enough both broke while I was wearing them normally, putting no stress on them.If casio could fix this small design fault this series of watches would be much more reliable."
1,Just Another Unfounded Japan Bashing Book,"There must be a lot of money to be made in Japan Bashing because this sort of nonsense just keep on coming. Does anybody remember ""Blindside: Why Japan Is Still on Track to Overtake the U.S. by the Year 2000"" by Eamonn Fingleton? Brilliant prediction, that one. This one is essentially the same book. Ivan Hall suggests that the ""enemy"" is only pretending to be in an economic recession just to fool Americans. In the context of trade tensions and bilateral battles for the public's heart and mind, he consciously inserts the specter of war atrocities into the debate; they did it once and who knows what might happen again. This is all old hat to the numerous Japan demonizers who made their fortunes telling prejudiced people what they want to hear. There is nothing new in this book. Just old accusations warmed over."
1,Nonsense of the worse sort,"The Yellow Peril has cleverly confused foreigners into thinking that Japan is in economic trouble. Foreign journalists, academics and diplomats are all part of this massive failure. Only the brilliant Ivan Hall has seen through their nefarious plans... <groan>Japan has a massive government deficit, an ageing population, indecisive politicians/policy makers and had the slowest growing economy out of the G7 for the past decade. Japan is becoming less important. For serious students of Japan, the sad reality is that Japan really has been doing badly. It is also sad that there is still demand for this type of Japan bashing/ Yellow Peril books.Not a serious study of Japan in any way. Avoid."
4,Non-greasy all day UV protection & moisturizer.,I've been using this UV protection moisturizer for a couple of years and have been very happy with it more so than any of the others I've tried. The only critisism I have is that it does leave a little residue on the skin after it dries like a lot of sunscreen lotions you might use at the beach.
2,Very Average,"I only Liked a couple of songs on this Disc.they were Epic&The Title cut.I've heard so-many Groups do this same style and it usually doesn't work.Be it Production or the Writting isn't up to par.They were a Catchy Group at best.with Epic they Paved the way for Korn,Limp Bizket etc.. among others and that's not saying much."
4,"A Stunningly Simple Family Story, But Very Potent In Its Straightforward Approach","1949's ""Rotation"" might be one of the most powerful films to rely on straightforward and non-showy narrative technique. It achieves much through its simplicity, oftentimes just advancing through the years and allowing the viewer to make necessary interpretations for themselves. The film covers twenty years in the life of one family from before the war to its aftermath. In just showing bits and pieces as the world evolves around the family, the 80 minute movie seems very fresh and different and covers a surprising amount of territory. Although sad and painful, I admired the level tone which lets actions speak louder than words.Lacking moralizing and overt politicizing, the film simply is what it is. And because it doesn't preach and posture, its emotional impact is all the greater. In many ways, its sheer simplicity makes it one of the most affecting and memorable movies about the war that I've seen. KGHarris, 10/11."
2,Good price and Good Sound but mediocre otherwise,"I bought this player because of all the good reviews and it had a built in FM radio, line in recording and it had a drag and drop feature for copying files.When I got the player I was immediately disappointed because the player though very light was made of very cheap plastic. Also, the buttons does not seem very sturdy.The MP3 sound quality is good but the FM radio reception is very poor. I previously had a Nomad II, which had a much better reception.The line in recording is very useful but it is of very poor quality and so it is not really worth it. It is much better to use a computer to encode the MP3 songs.I am definitely returning mine and my hunt for another player continues."
1,I liked it until it died,"I really liked this MP3 player when I first got it, except for the color. It was darker in person that it showed on the computer. Besides that, the MP3 player worked great. It was my first one I had gotten and it was easy enough to use since I mostly used it for workouts and just let it play in order. The first problem I had early on was that it would get stuck after 1 certain song I had on it. At first I thought it was just the song because I would power it off then power on and it would work fine on the next song. I probably had it about a year to a year and a half before one day it just stopped working. At first I thought it was the battery because it kept powering off, but when I put new batteries in it, it wouldn't turn on.It might have been that it could have been easily fixed, but I just would rather go buy a new one instead of dealing with the hassle of fixing it for the price it cost."
2,"It was great, but...","I got this player as a gift in April. It was fantastic until the beginning of December, when it wouldn't turn on. After trying to turn it on about ten times it finally worked, but never again. Now it doesn't come on at all. I sent and e-mail to the company for advice. They recommended some procedures that didn't help. Now they say that it needs to be returned to them for service, at a minimum of a $25 fee for labor, plus postage. I think that this type of product should last for more than 8 or 9 months and if it doesn't the company should fix it for free. The guarantee is for one year, but labor is only covered for 3 months. I'm not sure that it is worth spending the $25 when models with more memory are now available at lower prices than was spent on this. Now I will look for a different brand."
3,Good for what it's worth.,"This is probably one of the smallest MP3 players out there and for that reason it serves it purpose. However, the sound processing is a bit to low to my opinion, it's usually very hard and it tends to blend details wich make most music sound a bit murky. This can ofcourse be improved by better headphones but those included are, well, a bit of a crap to be honest. Even with better headphones the audio clarity isn't quite as good as in e.g. the iPod (wich also has crappy headphones) but then again, MP3 is not the best format to enjoy detailed music anyway. Music should be experienced with quality amplifacation driven by decent speakersystem."
3,Buzzing noise and bad earphones,"Pros- very light and small, vibrant colorsCons- There is a buzzing sound owhen the backlight is on. The headphones are also poorly made - the covers slip off easily and one of my earphones stopped working altogether after 9 months.Radio reception is also bad."
4,Love this gorgeous gadget,I love this gadget. It was smaller and lighter than I thought it would be. It does more than I expected...I'm now able to transfer my cassettes into MP3. The sound quality is excellent. I loved the armband feature as well. Transferring music is incredibly easy...just drag and drop.I have two small quibbles with it though...1. the line-in connection is too short...it should be at least another 6-12 inches long.2. The covers have begun coming off the headphones which seem a little cheap compared to the quality of the device itself.It's for these two reasons that I haven't given it 5 stars. But when I go to replace this product...it will be Creative again.
5,The boys are back!!!!,Throw this cd in your car cd player...roll down the windows...and keep on driving...AWESOME SUMMER CD!!!!!
4,"The American ""Smiths"".","This is an excellent debut from them, and a nice slice of alt-pop from before the ""alternative"" scene blew up. They actually have a brit-pop kind of sound, depite being from the eastern USA. It's not too terribly deep, but the songs are happy, the singing is sublime, and I play it often, even after 13 years. The track ""Drifting, Falling"" has some cool sax in it, ""Just Let Me Know"" is a favorite, and ""Familiar Face"" is a nice closer. Another superb album of theirs is ""Beneath The Rhythm & Sound"", though it's out of print. Overall, this is a must have, especially if you own cd's from ""The Lightning Seeds"", or ""Trash Can Sinatras""."
4,tires,This item was for a small car the kids drive and these tires were just the right size for it. Good purchase with fast service.
1,Noxious Nylon!,"I purchased the full set of these Calphalon Nylon tools and while using the spatula, I noticed a very strong plastic odor that permeated the kitchen, pot and the food. I noticed the end of the spatula was melted! Then, last night I used the slotted spoon to stir some pasta, and the very same strong plastic odor filled the kitchen. These tools are not as they are advertised ""heat resistant nylon"". They ruined the meal I prepared and actuality stunk up the drawer they were stored in. One can still smell the noxious odor on the spoon."
4,Swimways floats are great,My kids love the bright graphics on this float. It is easy to inflate since you only have to blow up the pillow and the small ring surrounding the body. It is very durable. We have bought several of these over the years. Even with rough usage from my grandkids (They seem to think it is a trampoline or a diving board.) they hold up extremely well. They are comfortable for lounging or sitting. The colors hold up well without significant fading. Far and away our favorite pool loungers.
3,Shelters of Stone - 5th in the series.,"Pretty good but I liked all (4) of the earlier ones in the series better. Jean Auel is an awesome writer but there was less story and more prehistoric details displaying the author's extensive research of those early humans than I would have liked. After the first 4, however, I was glad to read about Ayla's new experiences.Cara"
3,Sandra Dee is the ONLY Gidget,"This Gidget movie is certainly not the best one made, but is does have some enjoyable moments. However, things are spolied by making Moondoggie fall for the Italian tour guide, and have Gidget falling for Paulo. It spoils their relationship to think they could be so easily tempted to stray from each other. Other than that, the movie was not too bad, although I miss Sandra Dee and still believe she was the only real Gidget. It is, however, great to see the same old Moondoggie. Overall, not a bad movie."
2,Earl's Kapap review,"I found this book to be very basic.If you have any martial arts training at all save your time and money.If you practice a stand up art you may find the ground fighting section beneficial,but even that isn't all that impressive.Kapap is probually a really good martial art,but you aren't likely to see that from this book."
1,almost worthless...,"it goes into some brazilian jujitsu (Im sure not as well as a book dedicated to bjj) after that basically some ""martial arts"" type of defenses against weapons, and minimal pictures about boxing punches... It mystifies me as to how a ""military system"" would espouse ""boxing""... then it goes into detail about fitness conditioning. This seems to be the thickest part of the book. I consider this book almost worthless... I will probably end up lining my bird's cage with its pages...If you want to learn self-defense, I think you would be better served with Kelly McCann's ""Combatives for Street Survival"". It is a much better book. Give this one a miss..."
2,All Fluff no Filler,"Having been in Martial Arts for 31 years now and having taught for the last 15, I can say that this book will do you NO GOOD.... I bought it with high hopes and was let down. I gave it 2 stars since it does have some good stuff from Jean Jacques Machado, however I thought I was buying a book on Kapap.. Instead the only technical aspects of the book came from BJJ and really didn't have any substance of KAPAP. If you want a good book get the one called Complete Krav Maga as it has actual techniques. This book doesn't."
1,Bad!,It took almost an entire month for them to get this book to me. I ordered it about a half a month before my class started and got it half way through my class. I returned it without even opening the package and am still waiting for a refund on my purchase. Again it has been over a month and still no refund. Do not buy from this company. I purchase books on a regular basis through Amazon and it rarely takes even 2 weeks for them to arrive.
2,A much higher quality version is now available,"This is an import CD of Percy Faith's original 1954 mono recording of Music of Christmas. The 1959 stereo re-recording of that album is the version that made it legendary, however, and its CD reissues areMusic of ChristmasandMusic of Christmas. If one wants a CD of the original mono album, there is now a version available offering much higher sound quality, the first disc (of 2) inComplete Music of Christmas. Besides the first disc's higher sound quality version of this music, the second disc of that CD set is a newly remastered stereo version of Mr. Faith's second Christmas album, Hallelujah!, which was first issued in 1958 and later reissued in 1965 as the Music of Christmas Vol. 2. It is a legendary Christmas album in its own right and the CD version has been out-of-print for several years, until now."
4,"Sturdy Exterior Construction, Average Interior","I purchased this case to carry several items needed in my Christian ministry. I found the exterior to be quite rugged and durable, but the interior compartments were more flimsy. Nonetheless, the case should hold up to most uses. Highly recommended."
1,WTF,HOW CAN U HAVE AN ALMOST COMPLETELY HILARY DUFF STUPID POP CRAP AND STICK IN AN MXPX SONG??????????
2,big hair and miles don't go well together,I am not a fan of Miles in the 80s. Everything that I have heard sounds like elevator jazz. There's no life to it. Get We Want Miles to hear some good live Miles from this era.
1,Miles away from his jazz milestones,"This electronically challenged mumbo-jumbo from the eighties might very well appeal to the broader audiences Miles Davis has tried to reach throughout a great portion of his career.However, for a jazz fan such as myself it is a great pity to hear this brilliant trumpeter in a completely inappropiate surroundings."
4,If You Like Blues...,"This is an excellent soundtrack if you like blues. I got it just for the Mohammed Rafi track used in that Indian dance routine. What's nice about this soundtrack is that the music for the film was chosen specifically based on it's merits. This is a rarity these days, with many movies incorporating music because of some record deal or the company trying to promote some up and coming band/singer.Too bad this movie didn't get as much exposure as it should have."
4,Blueshammer??....what the...??,"I find it utterly depressing that a fan of the Ghost World soundtrack could possibly favor Blueshammer over some of the most influential music of all time. That's disgusting, why it was even included on the soundtrack? I don't know. It's obvious that the writers thought it was [garbage]...and rightfully so. Mr. Freddie rocks!"
5,Great Soundtrack - Blueshammer is so great!,"For comedy value, Pickin' Cotton Blues (a play on ""Cotton Pickin' Varmit"", a exclamation favored by Yosemite Sam) is the best song on this album. When I reviewed the complete track, with the adolescent lyrics and ""musicians"" who seemed to be stuck in an A-B repeat loop, it was hard to keep from laughing hysterically. Especially after having just seen the film. Notice how the background music in the bar playing betwen the obviously talented (and ignored) ragtime (although not strictly) musician and the physical appearance of Blueshammer (Are you ready of Boogaye?!) in the credits is also performed by Blueshammer and how both ""songs"" start out exactly the same way and sound similar.Of course, it is the quality of the rest of the tracks, except for Graduation Rap, that make this soundtrack a valued part of a collection as well as a springboard for further discovery of forgotten talent."
1,Worthless,No depth of topic...many grammatical and spelling errors. Screen shots are way too small. The examples were completely innapropriate and too thin to learn anything. It was hard to believe this was written by an academic. I thought about donating it to the library..but they didn't want it either. And by the way it should have been grounded in research...where's the data???? The developmental strategies are WEAK. Thumbs down. As a corporate web developer it was useless for my needs.
5,I'm Going On-Line - This is the Book for Me!,I've taught on ground in many formats. I've served on Faculty Development Committees. I've taken an on-line course on teaching on-line. I think this is a great book on what's important. The back cover review is right on target.
2,Not that fun for younger kids (3-6 years old),The songs are probably more fun for older kids 7-12 years old. I bought it for a camping themed birthday party and didn't use them bc some of the songs weren't appropriate for 5 year olds and younger.
2,Testament takes a turn.,"Well what can i say about Testament, There one of the best thrash bands out to emerge from the late 80's. But this album is not really Trash, Some Elements of some Death- Chuck's voice But Does sound pretty mean, To me i dont think its that good of an album if you really Know testament and what they sound like before this album.I would go with The New Order, Preach, Legacy. If you really like the sounds of this album go with Low, Gathering. Demonic is the last in Line with Testament."
4,A classic What If? episode exploring the nature of leadershi,"Episode Five (""The Enemy Within"") is a good example of what the old Star Treks did best: present a concrete, humanistic problem and explore it with neat, tidy dialogue and pretty respectable acting (a poor man's Plato). Bipolar divisions have become all-the-rage as an area of study and exploration in the late 20th C. Here it is: good/evil; saint/savage; rage/rationality. This episode presents each side and then brashly suggests at the end that the evil or savage side may be the most important characteristic of an effective leader (what would Picard say?). The old episodes seem to provide the most concrete, packaged nuggets of philosophy; and in a way that makes them less Science Fiction than the newer incarnations, which enjoy the multi-million dollar sets and SPFX and, well, science."
4,you've got to love prince,"I really liked this CD. It fit the movie, but it sounds great on it's own, too. What more could anyone ask?"
3,Took me by surprise,"I remember when ""Batdance"" was a hit in '89. I totally, 100% HATED that song when it came out. But ten(nearly 11) years later, I actually missed the song and I got the CD. I give it four stars because I don't really remember all the songs(I have listened to the whole CD). But I like how funky(and 80s)it sounds. One day I will listen to the while CD and give a better opinion."
4,"Good, but not Essential","This is a fun Prince album. It's essentially an album of throw aways: but fun, funky, danceable throwaways. Prince's throwaway's are usually better than the best band's 4 month labored over song. It's also fun to hear these songs and remember them from the movie, which I haven't seen in years. Worth buying, but don't expect brilliance."
2,Hohner D40 Concertina,"My first impressions of this instrument were very good, but I soon found that it was very easy to get buttons to stick, leaving their valves open even when the buttons aren't pressed. I think that this is due to weak valve springs and could be easily fixed, but the fact that it was so quick to happen reflects poorly on the quality of this concertina."
5,A must for Gidget fans!,"If you are a Gidget fan, you will love it! I am a Sandra Dee fan too, but Debra Walley is talented and puts more ""pep"" in to the character. And yes, James Darren is a doll as always. I've watched it dozens of times, and never tire of it. You'll love the traditional boy/girl love story. Carl Reiner is great in the ""flip"" of parent/child role, and the music is great."
4,She goes Hawaiian all the way ...,"This movie isn't as good as the first ""Gidget"" but it's better than the third . Ofcoarse, they should have stuck with Sandra Dee in all of them but having Deborah Walley in this one was, I think, a good choice overall .And I've always adored Joby Baker more than James Darren ( whatever happened to Joby ? ) !"
3,"Entertaining stories, but Kleypas is the best!","I gave this book a solid 3-stars because I really enjoyed the Lisa Kleypas story; it's the first one in the book. I have to say that the others were just average short romance stories, with ""Puddings, Pastries and Thou"" being slightly better than average. The prize for worst plot goes to Claudia Dain's ""Union"". It's not badly written but the heroine's (self-induced) dilemma was silly. This is a good, not great, Regency romance anthology."
3,3 out of 4 are good.,"I always have high expectations with Kleypas and she didn't disappoint. Kleypas' story was by far the best of the four. I liked the characters and the chemistry between them was great. I would give her story 4 1/2 stars.Cach is a talented writer. I like stories about average looking characters finding love. I thought that the romance was sweet and I liked the exchanges between the two main characters. I've never read any of her books, but after reading this sample, I probably would purchase one of her books. I would give her story 3 stars.Dain's story is one of the worst in any anthology ever published. The characters and storyline were boring. I really struggled to finish the story. It was torture. I give it 0 stars.The romance in Sands' story was cute. I liked the characters and the back story. I give her 3 stars."
2,Almost good,"Excellent metronome, with all basic features needed. I like the powerful click sounds, usually missing in other metronomes. Unfortunately this product has a major flaw: changing the speed of metronome is most difficult and annoying, considering how often it needs to be used. Should be so easy to fix problem . . ."
5,Amazing and wonderful!,"This is the life's philosophy that Jesus must have grown up with, as it is exactly what he taught to those around him throughout his life."
3,presented in tacky vision,"The overall impression I got from this book was that of a sales man trying to constantly trying to sell you on something. There are times when it seems like there is a lot of self congradulating and back patting. Overall the information is useful and interesting, though a shallow introduction to Kabbalah. My main complaint is the design of the book. I don't know who designed the layout of the book, but Jesus Christ it's damn near illegable. There are times when a medium florecent blue color is on a silverish grey back drop and is almost lost entirely. With something that is this powerful there should have been more thought going into the readability of the text. if it was ever to be reprinted it would behoove them to stick to a more traditional layout design."
3,Made Overseas,This has already been previously mentioned but I will reiterate. These are cheaply made products from overseas. My 8 year old will like them but I don't expect them to last for the long haul. I was okay with the price since it had free shipping. It has lots of pieces but don't expect a great quality.
4,Old style toys that my son loves,My son has been asking for army guys so we bought him these. Great gift lots of fun. The seller did a terrific job.
1,Warning: nonaudiophile 2007 remaster.,"Chet Baker's ""Chet"" album is at the top of my favorites list, which I give five-stars. HOWEVER, that applies to the clean, lovely 1987 mix on CD and the recent LP reissue, NOT to this poorly-engineered 2007 24-bit remastering by Joe Tarantino of Fantasy Records, Berkeley. Sadly, this ""demastering"" ruined the album with a ludicrously overblown bass boost. On both of my two music systems (hi-end and well-tuned) this remix inflicts boomy headbanger bass onto what previously was a gloriously balanced jazz performance. Avoid this issue and look for the properly-engineered 1987 release; you'll be rewarded with some of Chet's remarkable jazz ballads from his peak years."
1,Didn't grow. Not 1.,"I purchased these along with several other types of seeds from this seller. Most of mine sprouted, but we are nearly in July now and the 2 herb seeds I ordered from the, this being one, have NOT sprouted - not even a single plant. I wonder if there was mishandling or freezing/overheating prior to shipment - who knows, but the seller has not responded to my request for guaranteed replacement seeds!"
2,Not five stars,Not the best. Seems like it was done by teenagers. Could use a lot more suspense and less blood. AND a little shorter running time would have been good.
5,Best Marketing Mash Up yet.,"Peter Fisk is a great information aggregator and knows how to separate the good stuff from the fluff.With 15 years of Marketing and Product Management experience under my belly I find this collection of tools and insights refreshing, timely and relevant.Buy it and keep it!Oliver Fritschcendesic.comvocationlab.comdenkzeuge.de"
3,"Good on Theory and Marketing Jargons, But Too Conceptual and Impractical","If this want to have a Marketing 101 Quick Course, read this one because it has all the important marketing jargons or fashion concepts in one place.If you are a true marketing warrior, listen to ""Branding for Profit CD"" set"
1,The real genius,"The secret is getting people to buy the book, now that's the best way to make money...Like the stock broker who always has a winner for you to buy, and then you wonder if he's really that good why is he working instead of listening to his own advice and really getting rich..."
4,College Outline for Introductory Algebra is very good.,"The book looks older. The pages are yellowed slightly, but otherwise in very good condition."
5,WEIRD MOVIE! OR AT LEAST I REMEMBER IT THAT WAY? DVD PLEASE!,I saw this movie on TV way back when and it has never left my mind! A very weird and scary tale of a bunch of elderly people who live in an old building and a wicked slumlord who wants them out. The elderly take the law into their own hands and do whatever they have to do to keep their homes! Really off the wall film that plays like a black comedy with some horrific moments! WHERE IS THE DVD RELEASE FOR THIS FILM!
4,I haven't tried the recipes yet but...,I can tell this will be an amazing cookbook. This is my first cookbook purchase as I usually just make up my own recipes or get them off the internet. The illustrations for the dishes and the ingredients is going to help a lot. I read thru some of the recipes and found them quite thorough and easy to follow. I will update if this book turns out not to be all I'm cracking it up to be.
2,Good if you like listening to static!,"I had high hopes for this monitor. We've been through 3 or 4 of them in the past 5 years. I like the range on this one. However, all I hear is static! We've tried everything but all we hear is alot of static and the sound the child makes is very hard to hear. When it's cranked up as loud as it gets, it's just loud static and baby crying sounds like a whisper. We've tried moving it around to avoid reception problems but no luck... doens't matter where it is inside or outside the house. I really want to get a second First Years 900 Mhz one but they no longer make the model we have - it was the best."
5,The best recording you never herd!,"Those of you who are reading this probably already know, but for you that don't this recording is one of the most inspirational and moving recordings I have ever herd. I have worked with both Mr.Jordan and Mr.Duarte as there FOH soundman in the midwest for years, and was totally blown away by this recording. ONLY ONE is a mind and body experience for anyone who truly loves music. If you don't buy this CD you will have missed out on a real piece of musical spontaneity and rawness by a power trio second to nun!"
4,yoga and meditation with Rodney Yee,"When I purchased this, I thought more yoga postures than just relaxation, meditation, and breathing would be on the CD, and I was disappointed until I began to practice the techniques. I have taken yoga lessons before and was pleasantly surprised to learn new things. His teaching method is so very effective! The book does contain instructions for almost any other postures you would want to try. I recommend it highly to those who want to stretch and become more limber or for those who need to get better sleep or to destress. I gave it a 4 only because the title might be a bit misleading; the content, however, is great."
4,Splendid Unit,"I own this DVD player for more than 6 months now. Shelled out ($$$) when I bought it. Price seems to have come down under ($$$) now. Even at ($$$), I think this is a splendid DVD player... great features, great picture, great sound. I preferred my BLACK unit to the GOLD one. It is slim and sleek. Now under ($$$), it is even better buy."
5,Old favourite.,"Have been looking for this book in stores for ages, so happy to buy it at such a reasonable price. Thanks :)"
5,"Good, but i have a question","wow, another great work by feist. i have read all his other books with the exceptions of shards of a broken crown and the empire books he co-authered. the book was captivating, fun, scary, and very thought provoking. if anyone can please tell me though (e-mail me) when did patrick have time to find his fairy stone? I dont see how he could have had time to do it especially after what happened at the end."
4,Healing Journey: Seven Steps to Inner Healing Power,"I've heard it said that in the midst of Einstein's explorations he knew that the answer would be both simple and relational. This book echoes Einstein's philosophy. It provides an outline with step-by-step guidance that helps to simplify the process of healing our relationships with God, self and others. Through personal example and directed exercises, it provides the where- withal to advance one's individual progress towards healing. I felt both affirmed and comfortably challenged. Not only did it restore a sense of balance to my life, but it invited me to accept the belief that the path I take can even become a journey of joy. The choice was mine with a little help from John Prieskorn."
3,Not as advertised,"I received this vest and yes it works but it only had two settings (on/off). When you turn it on it blinks. Their is no setting for it to be on all the time, also the web site says it takes 2 batteries, the package says it takes 3 batteries the package is wrong, only 2. If you want a vest that will blink all the time it is on, then this would be a good product for you."
1,Only worked for 3 days,"This item is a complete dis-appointment!The vest only worked properly for 3 days! AFTER 3 DAYS THE LEDS STOPPING WORKING COMPLETELY. I opened the battery/switch box and ""spread"" the contacts to hold the batteries tighter and that had it going till the leds on the LEFT SIDE of vest stopped working completely...after another 2 weeks like that... now ALL the leds are not working unless I mess with/wiggle the wires!Still good for the day i guess but I bought this for the ""blinking led"" functions for walking/running in early morning hours...I will be looking for a local source so if i have problems i can easily return it!!!"
4,Slick,"This is a pretty cool product. I purchased it and I did not expect much. But, the LED lights are really bright. I commute on my bicycle and I feel much safer with this vest on. I would recommend it to anyone who bikes in the early morning or at night. I cannot comment on how long it lasts. But it is cheap enough that if it had to be an annual purchase I would certainly fork over the money."
1,You get what you pay for...,"This DVD player was not worth the money, it was returned the same day I got it! The digital out was not in its 'normal' form and it had typos in the menus. As soon as I put a DVD in, it flickered for awhile before the DVD started playing.I was not impressed by the quality of the workmanship or the quality of the player.I suppose if you want a DVD player to just play DVD's, this is for you. If you actually want to get use out of the great quality that DVD's have to offer, I suggest spending a little more money and go with a brand you trust."
2,Well....,"I saw an ad in local electronic store for even cheaper. However, after I purchased and used it, I've decided to return for a few reasons. 1. It doesn't play VCD 2. DVD player loses connection to TV for no reason. I have to manually unplug the cable and replug it a few times, and I don't even move TV around nor the player at all. 3. The remote control doesn't work half of the time. Not to mention the buttons on the DVD player itself."
4,Works great!,"I just plugged this up yesterday and it works fine. I had it up and running in 15 min, with my digital ready receiver. The 5.1 sounds great and the picture is good. I would say for the price this is a good deal. It also has a nice icon menu on the onscreen display. If your looking for a basic DVD player with a few extras, I would recommend. You could always give it to the kids later, when you decide to upgrade."
3,Paint it black,"This is a good DVD player. It has everything you want (even comes with DTS) at a price you can't beat. I'm sooo glad I bought this player. It's easy to set up and easy to use. A great first DVD player for anyone who is thinking of getting a DVD player. It's a great bargin. I wouldn't use it on my HDTV, home theater, but if you just want something simple that looks great, this is the one. Haven't had any problems with it, what can I say I love it. It was cool.Big Truck"
4,Occasionally overheats,"5 stars for a cheapo dvd player?Well, it would be if it didn't rarely overheat. For a cheap-o, this machine is great. Search the web to really unlock this machines secret powers.This is not a DVD player for someone with a massive home theatre - it's missing many advanced features. It's great for occasional use and even low and mid-range theatres. It's international features make it a great secondary player even for big theatres too."
1,Disappointment,"After having for only a few weeks, it simply stopped working. The DVD player would stutter & would not stop until the unit was unplugged from the wall. This would happen several times per DVD (that worked on other machines). One of the DVDs got stuck in the machine. We are waiting for the return to go through now."
1,I wouldn't if I were you!!!,"I bought an Oritron 300 DVD player, lasted for 4 DVD Viewings, then died! Their service is non existent. They'e send you e-mail after email basically telling you to unplug it and plug it in again, and I can't find anyone to repair it. Makes a good bookend, so if that's what you want, go for it!"
1,Don't bother,Doesn't really do much of anythying. Yes it gets hot but when coupled with thehigh volume of air coming out of the blower the air is cold two feet away fromthe unit. Can't turn the blower down low enough to make this little heaterworthwile.
2,The Three Musleteers (1948) DVD Review,"This 1948 version of The Three Musketeers is rather dated and silly. I couldn't take any of the characters seriously. Children should find this film entertaining, though."
3,Three Musketeers-three stars,"This is really two movies in one. The first movie is a lighthearted sendup of the famous tale. We're quickly drawn into the swashbuckling fun and settle ourselves expecting a romp throughout. Then the movie decides to be a heavy drama saturated with so much Tchaikovsky's ""Romeo and Juliet"" that by the end we aren't sure what to think. Perhaps if it had gone one way or the other it would have been more satisfying.There are nice moments though. Gene Kelly's athleticism alone makes it worth viewing and Lana Turner turns in one of her best efforts. The rest of the cast is hit or miss and the music is overbearing at times, but if you're a Kelly or Turner fan you should get enough enjoyment out of it to make it worth your while."
4,Excellent tool.,"I love this spatula/cutter, I use it specially to cut lettuce, because is nylon it prevents the lettuce from becoming brown and old looking the next day. I've used it to cut pizza, cakes and soft veggies. I love it."
4,Useful Application of Jungian Types to Leadership,"This has been done before, but the author here does it very well--The book applies the four classic personality types to ten different leadership functions. In addition to the explanations of the author's view of the ten leadership functions, there is advice on strengths and weaknesses of each personality type in applying each of the ten functions. The author focuses on trying to work effectively with your personality type. He assumes (correctly, for most of us) that we are not going to change decades of personality traits based on reading a book. So he doesn't urge the introverted reader to ""be more outgoing"" or try to make the control freak loosen up. Worth reading for those who aspire to manage or lead."
4,Experience the world through eyes that have time to see.,"Christy Brown gives an intricately etched picture of the human spirit that cannot be beaten, smashed, drunk, drowned, maimed, or murdered out of defiant existence. The story is of a family living on the edge of absolute poverty in a Dublin slum, the tale of an unending stream of kids being born to a worn-ragged mother and an abusive, drunken father, through the eyes of a son made mute and unable to move on his own by an un-named crippling condition (cerebral palsy we are to assume, Brown's affliction). The tale is not a navel-gazing excercise in simpering self-pity and psychoanalytic blame-casting, as is the standard fare today, but a book that captures the shocking stupidity, humor, farcical violence, and unshakeable love of the family's existence, in detail unsurpassed by anthing else that I've read. And that's just one level of many by which one can enjoy this book"
5,great boat book,"this is a great, easy to read book with wonderful, colorful illustrations! my kids love boats and this is a great addition to our book collection"
3,A good book but leaves you wanting at the end.,This book starts out great. You learn a lot about the characters and the places they go. You learn about the horrors they see and experience and how they overcome them. It is a true love story set in war-ridden India in 1857. This would have been an excellent book but it's about 300 pages too long. After awhile I got bored with it and just wanted it to end. This was a great story but it was too drawn out.
2,Nice lenses but not Durable,"All the reviewers are right about the Competivision lenses, they are nice and make the tennis ball stand out. But there are two major problems with these sunglasses: the upper portion of the lenses that fit into the frame crack, for no good reason, and the lens fall out. The second problem is the nose piece comes off. You can try to glue a new nose piece on but it continues to come off. There are many other tennis players here in Tucson that have the same problems with these glasses. For the price of these glasses, one should not have these quality issues."
3,beginners guitar course,"It is a little hard for my grandson to learn from, the book is great but the DVD and CD are alittle harder to learn from"
3,"Not great, not bad.","I purchased this book for my 8 yr. old for her birthday along with a guitar. The quality of the book is not the greatest, but it's not bad. She seems to be able to follow it easily, so I like the concept of this book. I just wish that the book (cover and back) would have been made of stronger material. I fear that it will get worn rather easily. Overall, not a bad book for the price."
1,Millennium Greezy,"I love their first 2 albums they are *****. Don't bother to waste your money on this CD, not sure what they were thinking. It doesn't come close to their early stuff. I was bored out of my mind trying to pay attention to it."
3,Good...but its Soy protein,"I typed in ""whey protein bars"" and this was one of the items that popped up. I dont know now, but back when I bought them, there was no indication in the description these contained soy."
5,great introduction to classical studies!,"This, the second in the series, covers the history of Rome from Augustus (30 BC) to the eastern and western emperors of the 6th century AD. Richly illustrated throughout, this covers the life of each ruler and really brings this era to life. A, extremely readable book.One aspect I liked was being able to put a name and a face to some of those who initiated the construction of the many buildings we lump together as 'built by the Romans.' Who was this Caracalla who built the famous baths in Rome and what was life like under him ? And what about Nerva who built a forum? ...Lots of info also on events that occupied the Roman empire; Masada; the defeat of Zenobia; the Goths.For earlier Roman history, see 'Chronicle of the Roman Republic' (750 BC- 14 AD)"
2,"Russell Peters: Red, White and Brown","Love, love love the humor of Russell Peters, but he used so much foul language in this DVD it was as if he was getting paid ""per swear."" Not that I expect anyone who is talking about real life to not include the occasional four letter word, where they are appropriate...but this was unnatural! A good bit of sexual content as well.Some folks don't object to this, but for me it detracted from his natural wit."
4,Standar Russell Peters Comedy,"If you liked his earlier shows, you'll like it. Its pretty good but can't be as good as the earlier one but still pretty close."
5,Very Cute!!,"Like ""Peek-A-Moo"" which we also own for our daughter, this book is very cute! The flaps are nice and big and very easy for tiny hands to open. The colors are bright and bold and my husband and I have so much fun with this book with our 10 month old who loves flap books."
3,Not Terrible...,"...But not great either. To me, these bars taste like all the rest, just slightly less nasty. They will do in a pinch though and if you travel quite a bit, you know what sort of junk they try to sell you (for a high price) on planes and in airports. These beat eating fast food any day!!!"
3,"Taste fine, but where is the peanut butter?","I can hardly taste any peanut butter. If I closed my eyes and didn't know what flavor I was eating, I would not guess this had any peanut butter in it.Ok, so no peanut butter taste.. but on the good side, it's creamy and tasty and they are very filling. Nice to switch off between these and theBalance Carb Well Nutrition Energy Bar, Caramel 'N Chocolate, 1.76 oz (50 g) (Case Pack of 15). Now THOSE taste really GREAT. These are ok..."
1,"Chalky, Yucky, Dry","I avoided eating these until I ran out of all my other low carb bars. Even then, had to choke them down because they chew like gum and you never really get a good 'mouth feel'. The coating is waxy and not a hint chocolatey."
3,Oh well,"I've often heard lightening doesn't strike in the same place twice. This falls into that category. Compared to the first season, the second season was so-so. There was still the humor of Junior (to me the funniest of the characters), and the wit of Mama, but other than that...so-so. A pox on the powers-that-had-been that made the changes that ruined this potentially great show."
3,That's My Mama season two-only 13 episodes,"I never got to see this show in it's first run but remember my older brother loving it. I was curious so I bought season one on DVD, also got this season for free during an amazon promotion. It was a funny show, but sadly, it never got a chance to really hit it's stride. This season had some changes: a different opening, a different character playing Clifton's sister, Earl is now cutting hair in the barber shop. I found this season to be even funnier than the first. It is too bad this season only contains 13 episodes. I give it only 3 stars because the price should be lower due to that fact. If I didn't get this DVD during Amazon's buy one get one free promo I dont think I'd have bothered buying it at all. It is a good show but for the price wait until they have another buy one get one free promotion before putting your money down on this limited episode set. Other than that, it is a funny show."
3,It's not as good as season one...,"I had no idea that such a tv series even existed and so I was really blown over when I bought Season One of ""That's My Mama""! and oh my my my, I loveeeeeeee it!Clifton Davis was so fine!Well Season One was wonderful, but season too...not so much. I mean, I'm not sorry I bought it, but the story lines aren't as good, and some of the characters from the first season really don't cut it on the second season (Earl)."
5,works great,"Plugged it in, vista home premium asked for software, I put in the disk that came with it, a few seconds later it was loaded and worked perfectly with an old Palm Pilot I have."
1,not complete,"This book is part of a seminar so without the workbook it is not of much use - there are no ""dates"" described in the book, just general info that then refers you to a workbook - shouldn't be sold alone without indicating this."
1,Less Than Nothing Here,"Perhaps I'm too old, too tired or too beleagured to put up with this kind of nonsense. It's about as interesting as hypochondria. Wish I'd never heard it."
1,In a word--torture,"90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. The only reason I watched this turd to the end was to satisfy my curiosity that it could not get worse--it did. Bad acting, bad effects (guns that don't emit smoke when ""fired""), bad dialogue--just bad, bad, bad. For sure the worst western and most likely the worst movie of any genre I've ever seen.If you get this movie for free, you still paid way too much. Avoid this one at all costs."
1,Useless - avoid at all costs,"Just got my Delta flip flash out after a few years in the cupboard. Why did I put it in my cupboard instead of using it? Because:1) the flash head bracket cannot take any weight2) the turn knurled knobs do *not* tighten at all. They are worthless.3) not enough forward reach with the arm (if say, using a 1.4x/2x TC combo with tubes/50mm for high mag shots4) arm is very stiff and difficult to move and pose5) no retaining lock on the bolt/knob on the base of the bracket. Quite a few times in the field it fell onto the ground when I tried to attach the bracket to my camera. Highly annoying.Good idea, poor design. Poor quality. Way over priced. Not recommended."
5,Wonderful book on the SS Castle on of my favorites,"This book has rare pictures, wonderful views of the SS Castle. The men that attempted to save Europe from Communism. Must have for someone interested in the SS or Himmler."
4,Sun is shining,"For those new to the Chall'Omusic label or the Buddha Bar compilations, let me inform you that it will be money well spent. Claude Challe is one pioneering Dj on the world music circuit who is always introducing ever new and ever undescribable styles, this man is not afraid to experiment. Main influences come from the middle east... Arabic, Asian, Indian etc, incorporating ambient to dance friendly sounds over two discs. I own most of his compilations. Anal? Maybe! But he has certainly influenced my style of dj'ing and that must count for something. Maybe a little on the exspensive side, around 35 per digi-pack, but I'd rather have one of these than two lesser quality chillout albums. While I am here I would also like to recommend ""Arabica"" on 'Bar De Lune' label. I don't think it is available yet as I have a promo/sampler but when it is released you better get your hands on it quick."
1,Worst baseball game out there,"I rented this game because everyone said that it was the best. The players look like plastic men. The realism is terrible. I aimed a pitch right down the middle, threw it very hard, and it ended up being a close call on a pitch down and in! Another instance is I had the bases loaded, and the batter grounded back to the pitcher. Double play right? Wrong. The picher caught the ball and took his time and lobbed the ball to the plate. The runner was barely out and no double play. I was holding X the whole time, too. They also over-exagerate on the super-stars. Randy Johnson is now a submarine pithcher. In the homerun derby Jason Giambi hits like 12 homers in a row, then gets 3 outs in a row. Another problem in Triple Play is that you either get out or hit a homer. When you do hit a homer it doesn't even show how far it went. Very bad game. Save your money."
3,Beautiful isn't always better...,"I am an avid baseball gamer who was thoroughly enthused to find out there were 3 hardball games coming out on the PS2. Now, after playing them, I want to cry. Triple Play, for instance, is gorgeous, the control is awesome, the sound is better, but they forgot the baseball. High Heat is more of a game, but they didn't take the time to work on the graphics. If you like a homerun derby with fielders, this is the game for you. If you want a fun game and don't mind pathetic graphics on the most powerful system to date, try High Heat. If you want an awesome all around baseball game, you better crack out an old copy of Ken Griffey on N64."
2,Saving the best for Xbox?,"I hope so. this is a very sharp looking game, but it's nothing like a real baseball game. There is no bullpen, no night games, the sound when you really get a hold of one is more like a cannon than the crack of the bat. Not much has changed from last year, triple play 2001, this years triple play for pc, and this game are the same. the two stars are for the graphics only! nothing else worth mention."
4,A Great Baseball Game!,This is the best baseball game out for the ps2. TPB (Triple Play Baseball) is way more fun than All Star Baseball. I know Because I have both games. TPB is more fun than All Star Baseball. All Star is boring its like watchng a baseball game on TV. In Triple PLay Baseball your in the game. My pick is Tripple Play Baseball for the PS2.
1,Another disappointing EA PS2 title,"This game is far too arcade like to be considered a baseball game... with cannon shots instead of realistic sound effects, awful awful motion, and gameplay that looks earily like World Series 2K, I can't imagine anyone buying this. High Heat or All Star Baseball would be a much better bet, and since this is ASB's first year on Sony, I'm sure that they have gone all out to show Playstation fans what they've been missing on the N64. Triple Play, no way."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!,"This game has horrible gameplay, it sounds like a friggin cannon when you hit the ball, there is absolutely no realism at all. Get High Heat Baseball. Don't waste your money on this cheap EA title!"
2,Wait for SEGA to make a Baseball game for PS2,I was totally dissapointed with this game. It may look good but the animations are unfinshed and the fielding crude. Wait till SEGA writes a baseball game for PS2 they have always made the best baseball games. World Series 98 is WAY better than this half baked attempt at a great game.
1,Too High Scoring even in All-Star Mode,"I love the games that EA Sports has put out ont the past. I could always depend on them to create the best sport games of the bunch.Was I ever wrong with Triple Play for the Playstation 2. Many of the things others have mentioned I also do not like. I have very high scoring games even in All-Star mode. The fielding interface makes it hard to catch any fly ball that is not hit near you in the outfield. I have players hitting HR's as much as the big HR hitters.Unfortunatly, I forked out $.. for this game. I will be renting other baseball games now before I buy them to see if they are any better.Anyone looking to purchase this game should rent it first to see if they like it. I would rent some others to compare it with as well.One more thing, Where is the Living Room field for the Home Run Challenge? I liked the off beat fields for a change of pace."
4,Good baseball game,"I have problems with what some of these other reviewers are saying. For one, I would bet that these people are scoring all of these runs on rookie level. Try it on All-Star and it is much harder. And it is not almost impossible to strike out someone as another reviewer says, you just have to know how to pitch. I must admit, the fielding control is a little off. It is difficult to get to gappers in the outfield, and I often throw the ball to the wrong base with the analog stick. Also, every hit is a grounder, a hardliner, or a fly ball. But this game has some of the best graphics I've seen, on the players and the stadiums. On the higher levels, this is a challenging game with great graphics."
4,keeps you reading to the end,"real life situations , too much creole and haitian language, better if shortened. More details than I needed to know. Lots of ups and downs in story."
2,"As I read, I was filled with hope.","In the end I was disappointed. Throughout the book two separate stories take place. One is a record of Bob Dubois, whose life is ruled by circumstances and bad life management skills. The other tells of Vanise Dorsinville, a young Haitian woman, who struggles to survive as she makes her way to America. Neither is a pretty story, and when the two characters finally meet it gets even worse. When I finished reading this book I was angry at myself for muddling through all the italicized Haitian accent dialogue and French Creole voodoo terminology. Yah mon, true!"
1,Not impressed.,Lacks something. Disconnected anecdotes and stories. Doesn't present a whole picture of what went on here. I don't agree with some of the conclusions.
2,"Good, but more of the same","If you like the type of music that radio is currently force feeding its public, then this CD would be acceptable. They have some good hooks, but no real substance. I'm not even sure if they are still around. For what they lack in musical creativity they match with business aptitude. Any band that lacks aggressive promotion and basic desire to achieve more, more often than not, reflects that same hum-drum attitude in their final product. In short, this disc does not [stink], nor does it stick."
2,disappointing,"It seems I have experienced the same problem with the non-stick surface pitting. But the most disturbing thing is when I called Kitchenaid, they said they do not make this pan. I told them that their name is clearly on the handle, but they referred me to Lifetime Brands. After being on hold with them, they said they do not make this pan either. All I wanted to find out was whether this pan can be used on the stove top. After making a roast, I then put it on the stove to make the gravy. I am guessing this is what caused the pitting, but it sure would have been nice to have heard that from someone officially. I will not purchase this item again."
1,$59.99 Disposable Roaster,"That is what it should be sold as, use it once and you have to throw it out. Bought this because of the Kitchen Aid Brand. Thought it was one of the best of the best, not anymore. Roasted a turkey, put the cooled pan in water to soak, teflon bubbled and peeled off. Only used cotton dish cloth to wash! GREATLY DISAPPOINTED NO P.......st OFF!"
2,Disappointed In Kitchenaid,"I've used KitchenAid for years. I have an electric range that's probably 17 years old and going strong. But lately, like every other company, they've cheapened their products; likely to put more money in someone's pocket. So sad! This roasting pan was a great design but after only a couple of uses the finish started bubbling and flaking off. Even the coating on the rack came off. Might as well have purchased a disposable pan for a few dollars."
5,Does what it is supposed to do..,Plug it in - Win XP installed without a flaw - little configuration in ZSNES - and away we go.
2,useless,"This item is useless. It isn't compatible with most the games I have and doesn't work the way a controller should work. Often, some of the buttons can't be assigned an action and since most games require duel joysticks, you can't never look around with this controller. AHHHH!!!"
3,Meh... its alright.,"What's with the ""wingman"" pic? I hate that sunk in d-pad. The one on the other pics looks alright though. Its got 2 L's and 2 R's, a start and select, and 4 action buttons, so its basically a PSX pad without the sticks. It looks very 'console' but alot of PC pad companies don't make stuff that lasts. If you really want console ruggedness on your PC, get a Lik-Sang adapter, download Joy2Key (its free) and dig any standard or aftermarket PS1 or PS2 pad out of your closet. You'll have a familiar controller, and loads of keyboard/mouse mapping options."
3,Great - but not for long,"This controller was perfect for me at first. It configured itself and performed perfectly, but only for about 6 months. The calibration went haywire on me and the right keypad began behaving like it was being pressed when it wasn't. So if I took my hands off the controller, the right keypad would continue to perform its action. Not an expensive controller so its not a big disappointment, but I would have paid 3 times as much to have one that was durable."
3,Logitech Controller,"I bought one of these to try it out, and I loved it so much. No driver needed, and it worked well.Then I bought one for my girlfriend, one for my brother, and another for myself (for multiplayer games). For some reason, two of them just stopped working. I don't know what happened."
5,"Solid, reliable, inexpensive controller","This device has been very reliable and accurate. We use it for a couple of specific video games, and it's been a good addition to the collection for games that need this type of controller."
3,D-pad is mush,I bought two of these so me and my GF could play a game together. The only problem I have with it is that the d-pad feels like mush. Everything else is a-okay.
4,Great inexpensive Controllers,My son and I purchased these controllers to be able to play some of the interactive games together and these controllers were definitely worth the purchase. The seller was able to get them to us in a quick and very painless manner - I really appreciate good business partners as well. These controllers fit well in hand and are able to be adapted in most games that allow controllers - this was a great buy.
1,book,"Ah this is a wonderful book and I'm glad we found a copy. Unfortunately, unknown to seller, a few pages had been removed (cut out) from the book. Too bad, but the seller was gracious and reduced the price. So my enjoyment of this book is about 50% ......?"
1,Fell apart after one use - I had to throw it away,"Enough said. This is a piece of junk. I used it once, and then the whisk fell out of the handle and I couldn't securely attach it back. It's a low-price item and returning it was too much trouble."
2,Useless,"Earlier this year I purchased a collection of Calphalon pots. I love them and wanted to keep them in excellent condition so I purchased a few of the Calphalon utencels. They may not scratch the pot, but they don't to anything else either. They are so flimsy that they will not mix anything, they just bend. They are useless."
2,Disappointed,"The whole time I was reading this book I kept waiting for something to happen. The entire plot is outlined in about the first ten pages, and then the rest of the book repeats basically the same events over and over. I found the main character so inactive as to be annoying. She managed to actively create the appearance that her husband was still there, but that's about all she does. I was also amazed that the more practical issues of her husband's disappearance, those related to money since he generated the only income and paid the bills, weren't really addressed. The author makes references to bills being unopened and past due, but Grace merely writes checks and solves the problems. Finally when she does act, at the very end of the book, we're left with a wholly unsatisfying, too vague ending. I think my strong dislike of Grace made it impossible to enjoy this book more."
1,Is this some kind of bad joke?,"Wow and I thought Kidz Bop was bad, but this is an insult to the whole hip hop community and to the artists who's songs on here. I always dreaded that this would happen but I never thought that record companies would sink this low for a quick dollar. It's sad because I like some of the songs on here and it breaks my heart to see them bastardized like this. Don't buy this, if you don't want your kid to hear cuss words than get an edited CD. Bleeping the cusswords is one thing but bastardizing good songs but watering them down for little kids when they never meant to be heard by kids is just sickening. Please don't buy this, if this crap flops than maybe stop Vol.2 in it's tracks."
1,The product description says that it is a set of four wheels and they only send two...I would give less than one star if I could,The product review says that this is a set of four but they only sent me two wheels. I would give a lower rating if it was possible!
