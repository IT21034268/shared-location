5,Demento's children....,Anyone who is a Dr.Demento fan has of course heard Barnes and Barnes.The humor and their musical ability is a perfect match.These guys can always make me smile.With words like...(when she asked me to carry her...I stopped loving her)..truley romantic for the demented...
3,Eh,"It does the job but if it gets dirty inside, kinda hard to clean out. I would buy them again though."
2,Not Updated,"The best part of this program is that it offers a variety of formats to use to write your resume. However, if you dare use the ""Resume Caster"" option, you'll get your email address sent to many different online employment agencies that will then send you job offers that are not even in your field. The end result is that you have a whole new set of spammers flooding your email box constantly. In addition, the salaries that they quote for some jobs are over 10 years old! So if you wanted to find a current salary range for the job you're seeking, you'll know what the WERE ten years ago. There are other parts of this program that are decent and I think it's worth a purchase for some people."
1,Don't purchase is you have Windows XP,"I have Windows XP media on my home PC. After loading this software, I got a message that critical Windows files had been replaced by an unrecognized version. It prompted me to insert my Windows XP Professional CD. I don't have this since I don't have Windows XP Professional. I rebooted my PC and it would not boot up properly. I had to uninstall this product and do a roll back. Once I did this, my PC was fine.If you have Windows XP, I would not recommend buying this product. It will screw up your PC. I can't really rate the actual product since I can't use it."
2,"Mostly clover, Only 8% broccoli","Even its label printed it contained only 8% broccoli, 66% clover. That's about how it sprouted too. NOT how it was advertised."
4,4.5 Stars!,"If you enjoy Maysa and/or Incognito, I promise you will love Karen Bernod too! She has that husky, smoky voice that makes you want to light some candles, curl up by the fire and chill, or makes you want to let down your hair and take a long drive on a warm sunny day! Well, at least that's how she makes me feel! When I listen to her...my emotions are tangible, as are her melodies and vocals!This CD is strictly for grown folks! There are no massive attack beats, trite verbage or silly hooks! She sings from her soul and it let's you know, she's serious about her #*#*!"
4,great movie,"The wedding is most definitely necessary in the American Pie Series. Unrated version way better of course, just make sure there are no kids around!!!! Boobs are everywhere so be warned."
1,The worst of the pie movies,"The only funny part of this movie was when Jason Biggs character shaved his junk and it ended up on his wedding cake. Most of the original cast wasn't present which really made this movie suck, and overall the story just wasnt that good. The first was great the second was alright, but this one could have been avoided. I would only get this movie if I purchased it in a set with the other 2. If you see American Reunion there are soo many things you wouldnt understand if you didnt watch the first or second. Cant say missing American Wedding would cause any confusion in American Reunion."
5,Not as good as the first 2,This will be short and sweet. 2 Stars for the movie. It was alright. But the rest of the stars go for Alyson Hannigan. The hottest woman going.
1,American Wedding,"I sat though 15 minutes of this ""film"" and then walked out. It's the worst piece of [film]that I have ever seen and should have been rated XXX for the language alone. Save your money and don't bother with this one...."
1,"if you want to laugh, tickle yourself!!!!",it's the easier way to laugh than watching this movie. It's full of stupid adult jokes and cursing. Don't watch this movie unless you have too much money to waste!!!
1,boo,"i didnt think it was even that funny. i had something to say about every ""funny-part"". some parts were all right but i believe the movie should have never been created. And that goes for the sequel. I wish i didn't waste my time watching it."
2,American Beauty,"Sooner or later, it would have to happen...Teen sensations Jim and Michelle are finally going to get married in this third episode of the ""American Pie"" series. Like the first two movies, this one is an average comedy with some funny characters who can make for the lack of a decent and creative plot. The jokes haven`t changed, going from predictable slapstick to utterly childish stuff, and for the most part the laughs are forced as they deal with trivial, unsurprising situations. Even though Jim is the one who`s getting married, Stifler seems to be the central character here, getting all the attention and acting in a particularly annoying way. But I knew what to expect anyway, so this isn`t much of a disappointment, although it`s probably the worst movie of the series. Still, it`s a passable flick to watch with some friends and laugh once or twice. It isn`t supposed to me more than that, anyway."
4,Camry cabin filter,The folds are fewer and larger than on the factory filter but the size is a perfect match. I anticipate the impregnated activated carbon will improve the air quality. I would recommend this product.
3,The price sticker on the box was [...].,This was a gift for my 4 year old grandson who is obsessed with Anakin Skywalker and pod racing. He loves it. I was dismayed after having paid almost [...] sticker on the box. I felt I was a victim of on-line misrepresentation.
4,Great one!,"What a great CD!This one really is marvellous! The vocals are very good and the lead singer's falsetto voice really gives a touch of real art to this CD. The music combines slow rock, country with a touch of nostalgia for the '70's."
1,very poor quality,color white had brown smears by handle and a black line or hair in the glazes on the rim. I had to return them and could not give as a gift. I wanted to give this product a minus-5. I was very disappointed.
2,Poor Quality film,I received my video inside the time limit but found the actual video not to be of good quality. It was viewable but colours were very poor.
1,Junk.,"Yet another good concept poorly executed. It changes direction at each end so slowly that it drowns the grass at the ends and barely waters the middle section. It's big, fragile, and so loose that you wonder if it's broken. Also, the adjustment knob is difficult to turn. The only good thing about it is the pattern width adjustment which, while hard to adjust, does provide for a nice range of narrow to wide patterns. Aside from the the drenching it gives at the ends of the sweep, its very nice for watering narrow strips of grass or narrow gardens."
4,Adjustable Sprinkler,I read the the previous existing owner review and bought one of these and agree with her review. This thing is nearly all plastic so I don't man handle it but because it is flexible plastic it allows for it to be adjusted for wide or narrow spray which has been very handy. This thing has proven to be the most reliable to turn on and forget vs. the moving tractor and other sprinklers I have tried which tend to get caught or gears stripped. This also waters very evenly and is QUIET. I give it 4 stars because it is plastic so my kids won't be inheriting it but then again if it were brass it would not be this adjustable.
1,Don't buy it.,"Once again another worthless computer software guide. I don't know who writes these things but they don't understand how ignorant the general public is. There is so much that is great about excel but this book didn't help me at all. I have never found a good guide by any company out there. There used to be books called ""Cue"" books but I can't find them anymore. ""Dummies"" books are even worse than this guide book."
4,For the money great headphones!,"These headphones are very good for $30 and at that price is the best you will see on a new pair.If you want to get better headphones you will have to spend alot more because the models that are $60-$90 are just about the same in sound quaility.The 10 ft. long cord is the big selling point for me because I record on a Boss BR-900 8 track system and a 6 foot cord is too short and coiled or extra long cord extenders are a pain to work with.Before you rate these listen to them for about 10 hours to let the highs loosen up a bit.When you first put these on the bass will be overbearing ,but these are not made for rap-happy DJs so after awhile the music will balance out.I have heard parts on songs I didn't know were there after listening to them on those crappy IPOD type headphones.They are comfortable to where and are not too heavy but are not that portable.These are good for recording because condenser mics pick-up bleed and the cups seal really well on my ears at least."
3,OK for the price,"Comfortable, good sound, long cord that tends to get tangled. Doesn't block out or cancel sound in the room. Good for the price."
3,"Great, if you like a form fitted headset.","The sound is mediocore, I have had panasonic and sony pairs that I purchased from Target that had better speakers in them. Also I prefer the wire to be on one-side only. If I had my choice again I would have purchased, Sentry 2.1 Surround Sound Headphones with Subwoofers."
3,not bad,"these headphones are a good deal for the price, but i'm not quite sure why every other reviewer is raving about it. the quality is decent but not amazingly crisp, bass is definitely heavy, but my biggest gripe is that quite contrary to the other reviews, these are very uncomfortable on the ears! and i've got small ears too, i'm not sure why others aren't feeling this. after about 5-10 min it starts to bother me, though bearable.but honestly i'm not blown away by the difference between this and the headphones that came with my panasonic portable cd player"
2,Disappointed,"I had read how well these performed as being noise cancelling, but I could hear everything around me just like any cheap headphones permit. I gave it 2 stars for comfort."
2,Terrible Terrible comfort.,"how in god's name are these headphones getting superb reviews? You must have tiny alien-type ears for this to not hurt your ears.sound quality is meh, It sounds decent for a $40 pair of headphones, but comfort was absolutely garbage.I have normal sized ears and within 1 hour, my ears got bloodshot red, started heating up, etc.. It was just so damn uncomfortable.Don't buy if you have medium to normal sized ears. I am warning you."
3,Tight and Tinny,"Found them to be almost too tight, luckily my ears are small enough to fit inside the headphones. Also doesn't seem to have any bass, and I could hear distortion when there was bass. Soo meh, it's worth it if its in the $20 range, but i wouldn't want to pay more than that. Too bad mine cost $35 ... doh!"
3,Not recommended. Size is indeed the problem.,"I bought the EH-150 after reading the reviews. I noted that the only significant problem appeared to be tightness. Since I have a small head (6-7/8), it seemed to be worth trying. I am not a critical audiophile so the sound is great. But I have very small ear canals that close if there is any pressure on my ears. That is why I was looking for circumaural headphones. Stores typically have only their most expensive headphones on display so you can try them on. Regrettably the EH-150 ear space is too shallow and too small. The pressure closes my ear canals and I get a muffled sound. These are likely to be comfortable only on people with very small ears and heads. The good news is that Amazon had refurbs available at a great price. So, I am not out much."
1,lemon,"This monitor developed a burn-through line within 3 days and had to be returned. Perhaps I just got a one-off bad one, but I didn't bother to replace it with another of this same model. Also, if you try to set the screen area at anything less than 1280x1024 (as you have to to see any smallish print), an annoying message comes up every five minutes right smack in the middle of the screen telling you that your resolution is less than optimal. I couldn't figure out how to get this message to close -- perhaps it's somewhere in the manual -- but who has time to bother?"
2,explanatory notes are a must!!!,"This is good attempt to make a question bank in biochemistry. All the questions are in MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions)format. The questions have reasonable quality. Real analytical questions or numerical oriented questions (as we expect from thermodynamics, enzyme kinetics etc)are missing.The spiral bound format of the book makes it highly vulnerable to wear and tear. However, the biggest drawback is the lack of explanatory notes for the answers. Just answer keys are given. The publisher could have brought out its second edition with a bingbang, rectifying all these defects. Even now its not too late ...."
5,Great buy for the money.,The leather tote bag is a high end quality item. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a premium travel carry on bag.
1,same problem,Incomplete package as others mention...twice!!!!! On the ph w/ Amazon for over an hour with no resolution.Will not buy this product because it appears all PLUS packages are FALSE.
4,lowrance H2OC plus,"Unit works very well in constant moisture of professional fishing,my only problems have been downloading detailed maps from computer to memory card. Really wish this unit had a barameter on it. All in all I would recomend this unit."
4,Quick easy read,As an Infectious Diseases specialist I had to be adept with the issues related to same sex relationships. I bought this book way before I even started my sub-specialist training and it has served me well. I was more aware of the issues of my patients and me being so knowledgeable helped them to open up and trust me a lot more which is what every physician wants... I would recommend it.
2,Got granite?? Beware!,"I was so excited to receive my new Rivage dinnerware today. I served my hot meal onto a plate, then sat the plate on the granite countertop. The plate shattered immediately. What a bummer!"
4,Be Careful,"I LOVE these plates. They fit great in the dishwasher and are great social pieces. However, beware. The ""salad plate"" is the size of a regular dinner plate and the dinner plate is just huge! I have dropped it on more than one occasion and can say that it is definitly durable."
1,Timi Yuro's samples,"The samples I listened to of Timi's do NOT do her justice. Timi Yuro was one of the greatest singers of all time!!! The original recording of""Hurt"" was fantastic and this sample sounds awful. Please, if you are going to promote this lady of the past and sell her recordings on CD's try and make the samples authentic and clear. Timi's unique voice can never be equaled as far as I am concerned, so preserve the talent ..don't ruin it. I have been searching for some facts about this lady also. Is she still living? If so, where and how is her health now?? The last news I have of her, she was very ill and quit recording. Please advise if possible. Thank you, Carolyn Babin cada@eastex.net"
4,Not an album that does her justice,"Timi was probably thegreatest white soul singer who ever lived.She unfortunately suffered from throat cancer for a very long time, and I believe this was recorded when she still wasn't really well enough to hit those wonderful notes that she once did, but the emotion is still there. Her voice sounds much deeper, but still very warm.This album is really for dedicated fans, and not one for first time listeners to her. I say this not to be critical, as I am one of her greatest admirers having been buying her music since 1961.This lady suffered from dreadful promotion, and should have been a huge star. Mike Rossiter UK"
2,floppyseat~CHUBBYSEATS,A friend of mine ordered this and it is harldy comparable to the chubbyseats. For the same price you can go online and order a chubbyseat in the fabric you like and have more cushioning for those little ones..
5,Wish I had thought of it....,This is a great product. Fits on carts well and also works well on restaurant high chairs. Washes easily and folds into its own pocket bag. I get stopped in the store all the time by people wanting to know where I got it. We love it. I am purchasing these for all my friends having babies.
2,NOT SO CONVENIENT:(,I just bought this floppy seat cover today and realized it would be impossible to hold your baby and try to put the cover on the cart at the same time. I did see the buggy bagg at Babiesrus as well but didn't want to spend $20 more. I now realize it's way worth the extra money to be able to do it one handed. Plus i like the fact that the buggy bagg has extra storage pockets for diapers and bottles. So... This is going back tomorrow and buggy bagg here i come;)
4,Get it right!,"The Australian CD single contains:1. Get Right (Album Version) (3:47) - It's track 1 on Rebirth album;2. Get Right (Fabolous Remix) (3:47) - It is the same version as track 1 with the inclusion of Fabolous' rap. It's track 12 on Rebirth album;3. Love Don't Cost A Thing (RJ Schoolyard feat. Fat Joe) (4:19) - This remix is the same available on Love Don't Cost A Thing CD singles and it's track 1 on J to Tha L-O! The Remixes album.4. If You Had My Love (Darkchild Radio Edit) (4:00) - It's the radio edit version of Dark Child's remix available previously on If You Had My Love singles.5. Get Right (Instrumetal Version) (3:47) - This is just the instrumental part of the album version.It is recommended as a collector item, as today the labels generally don't issue CD singles to be sold anymore, just as free promos. It doesn't add so much to whom already own the Rebirth album though."
4,As advertised,Good product. It does as it was advertised. A lot longer battery life than the standard battery if you don't mind the size. My camera has become a lot more enjoyable to use.
5,Battery review,This item was shipped and received in great time. I have been using it for over a month and it seems to last longer than advertised. I do not zoom and pause very much so that might help. I would purchase this again.
5,Perfect - glad I bought this,Not sure what to write here - it's a battery and it does what it's supposed to do. Glad I got it.
5,Fabulous series,Once again the BBC strikes gold with a series I enjoy immensely. Highly recommended for those who just can't seem to get enough of Britain's programming.
2,"Believe me, skip this one","I watched series 3 very soon after greatly enjoying the first two series. Disappointment is the only word for my reaction, and I'm trying to imagine why so many reviewers liked it. Only the beautiful scenery and Molly are there to recommend ""3"". It is as if all the humor and energy of the other main characters had been drained. Plots got very serious (new writers, surely), and the addition of the new bank character added gloom (she seemed to be in some psychological drama, not ""Monarch""!). Romance in these episodes is unconvincing, and, after the tragedy at the end, there is no mention or appearance of the daughter and grandchild or other key characters in the first two series -- unforgivable! If you loved the first two seasons, as I did, then remember them fondly and let them stand."
4,Monarch of the Glen - Series Three,"I love the quirky characters in this series, but have become a little impatient with the constant romantic triangles and the general denseness of Archie when it comes to matters of the heart. His parents can pretty much be counted on to stick a crowbar in the spokes of any project too. Couldn't the complications come from outside of the glen ocassionally? On the other hand, the supporting characters are all first rate. The season ends on enough of a ""down"" note, however, to make me wonder what Mollie and family will be able to do to cheer the whole clan up again."
2,pleasant listening rather for younger kids than adolescents,nice tape very basic level of spanish. Rather more useful for younger kids who need rehearsing than older ones.
5,A View Into My Soul,I can feel the young author's vulnerability and curiously in each poem. This book really warmed my heart .. thank you Ronnie Mickle.
5,This was an excellent SQL primer,"I spent a lot of time looking for a book that actually covered ANSI 92 SQL, and even though I vowed a long time ago to never buy a 'Dummies' book, this one was an exception and worth every penny spent! My database du-jour (Oracle RDB) is not a particularly well known or used database and with the help of Mr. Taylor I was able to create some very complicated embedded SQL statements, allowing my client to make some pretty important multi-million dollar decisions. Thanks Mr. Taylor for a well written book."
3,Fair but not great,"I am someone who is new to learning SQL, and I will say that if it wasn't for the fact that I am familiar with Access, I would be somewhat lost with this book. In some parts of the chapters Mr. Taylor gives detailed information, however a lot of the instruction is lacking. Often, he tells you to do something, but there is no step-by-step instruction. I am quick learner when it comes to software, programming, etc., but for someone who has no exposure to SQL or databases, I think this book would be frustrating.What I do like about this book is that he uses Access to teach you the SQL coding. Getting your hands on other programs like MySQL or Oracle can be a bit daunting for someone just starting out. Using Access makes learning a bit easier even if it is not the best DMS out there."
1,"This thing sucks so much, it literally killed my ipod!!! I hope Jensen Dies!!!","So, I've had problems with this thing randomly stopping music while it's playing, then one day while my friend had his ipod in it, it literally corrupted his ipod and deleted everything on it. Then, myself foolishly thinking it must have been his ipod that malfunctioned, had my ipod abruptly stop playing in the middle of a song. When I saw my ipod frozen, I restarted it only to find it not working at all, and completely ruined!!! I hate this thing so much, it just killed my ipod. Words can't describe my frustraion, please don't buy this god-awful piece!!! I f I could give it a zero I would!!!"
4,Great Starter,"Roberts is clear and concise. He works off of Goldsworthy's Gospel and Kingdom, but seeks to make it more accessible. He traces the storyline of the bible with the pattern of the kingdom, the perished k, the promised k, the partial k, the prophesied k, the present k, the proclaimed k, and the perfected k."
3,Stick with Sizzla and Capleton....,"I'm not totally sure what to think of this album, but one thing is for sure, I definitely do not like it. As far as the dancehall genre is concerned, this album falls far short. There are no tracks on this album that actually makes you want to dance. To get a true taste of Dancehall reggae, stick with ""Reign of Fire"" or ""Black Woman and Child.""If I were to judge this album on its own merit, I would give it a 3/5 stars, but I do think that is being a bit generous. I suppose the album is worth checking out, Cham has a unique sound, but its nothing i'd go nuts over"
2,Not too Great,"I don't know if we are all listening to the same CD but this CD is no good. Cham is capable of more. I've heard half these tunes, how many remixes of ghetto story which is over a year old are we gonna hear. The tunes are old and it's disappointing that reggae artists always have to use old tunes on their album all thet time. Sorry this album doesn't cut it."
1,A good critic stands by his reviews--Ebert just changes his!,"I am frustrated to find out that Ebert has changed his reviews based on public opinion or because a movie won an Oscar (see previous reviews). What respectable critic won't even stand by his own ""expert"" opinion? I will continue to consult Halliwell's version. Although he is often rather harsh, Halliwell nonetheless saves the stars for the rare, good movies--and he apparently will stand by his reviews."
3,Nice but not without problems.,"The wall mount bracket itself is very nice and sturdy. The problem was with the hardware supplied (or lack of for that matter). The screws for mounting the bracket stripped out immediately, had to use #9 drywall screws instead. Also, none of the screws supplied for mounting the tv to the bracket were long enough. I was lucky I had a stash of spare screws to pick from, and I had to cut them to length when I found the correct ones. But once installed, it has been great to use. I think most people would have had to make a trip to the depot, or send it back!"
4,Great Little Product,"When shopping for a TV mount for my RV, I was surprised how much mounts were costing - $50 to $80. For my 19"" LED, this little gem does the trick at less than half the price."
4,No rotation BUT theres a way to install correctly,You need to make only one hole first and then mound the TV and then level the TV and then screw in the 2nd screw. The weight of the TV makes the mount tilt so this is very important.Also note that the vesa mount side is not centered over the wall bracket but is actually offset to one side by 2-3 inches. This is because the double arm length is not the same as the single arm length. The single arm is 2-3 inches shorter than the double arm.These guys should provide this length info in the description but they dont.
5,this product is very good quality and arrived on time thanks!!,this product seems to be very good quality and fits my Sansui 19 inch LED TV perfect! it has very good adjustability and is made of good quality steel and has a good overall finish. installed in minutes as it has a single stud mounting system just got out the old stud finder and screwed it in!! thanks for your help
4,"Solid, make sure to level based off the top of monitor","solid buildwhen mounting, attach the monitor first, then the top screw, level the monitor (not the bar on the wall) then mark the bottom screw and attach.If you level the bar on the wall, the monitor might be crooked"
4,"Heavy duty, but leans slightly","Mounted this near the corner of an L shaped room to flip a tv from one side of the room to the other. It works well, is pretty sturdy, but it does lean slightly if it's extended fully.For the price though, i'd buy it again."
5,great product,Great mount low price high quality easy to install. no complaints or issues I would highly recommend. fine fine fine
3,Good Value but!,"Once installed it works as advertized. I was able to get it level and the TV level without a problem. However, the mounting screws they provided were useless. The heads stripped easily, even thought I pre-drilled the holes into the stud. I had to go out and buy better wall lag screws to complete the install. This turned a 30 minute job into a 90 minute job. The VESA plate does come off of the arm end easily, by removing the two tensioning screws on either side. This made mounting the TV easier since you can screw the plate onto the back of the TV first, and then just fasten the two screws back into the braket. It still takes two people to do this though. I was pleased overall with what I got for under $20.00."
4,awesome,"Is great item for a cheap price, since I isntalled I'm enjoyin a little more 'cause I getting a best view"
5,Great Mount,"Wall mount works really well! holds my 21.5"" ASUS VH226H monitor perfectly.Installation was incredibly easy to do. My process for installation: Find the studs in the wall and (make sure its level) screw the mount in. Remove monitor bracket from the rest of the mount and screw it into the back of the monitor. Screw the bracket back into the mount. DONE!You can tighten the joints to restrict or lock the position & tilt position which is perfect if you're like me and want it to only move in a very specific way or if you'd like it to be stationary. Build construction of the mount is really sturdy and doesn't look cheap or like it will break easily like some of the cheaper mounts do. Comes with many different screws for mounting your monitor and the 2 screws for the wall are very good!"
3,"OK, but not perfect","Nice unobtrusive mount. Folds up to a very compact size. In fact, I thought they only sent part of it when I saw how small the box was.I would happily give it more stars if not for a serious design flaw: the screws to tighten all of the joints are hardened steel, while the device itself is a soft alloy. It is impossible to tighten them enough to lock it in place without stripping out the screws, which I did. I would have returned it and given no stars if not for the ability to replace the screws with a standard nut, bolt & washer at the joints (like it should have been built in the first place). If the company that makes these reads this: a simple hex nut, countersunk into the joint would make a better product.Price was a good selling point also."
4,Great value for the price.,"I can only regurgitate the comments made in the other reviews of this product.Use your own screws (I had plenty of compatible screws laying around the house).There is a slight slant of my television when I move it to certain angles, although, I didn't use a leveler when installing the mount.Despite the previously mentioned issues, I think that this product is worth the investment. The slanting issue is barely noticeable. In fact, I probably wouldn't have noticed it had it not of been for the other customers' reviews.Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
5,Sturdy and easy to install,I saw a few reviews stating the monitor would point downwards. There is an adjustment for that. You do need to mount this to a stud in the wall even though they provide you with drywall anchors. They give you lots of screw varities for monitor mounting. I had two monitors and needed different screws on each one.
4,Good but cheap!,"Great wall mount for the price! It does tend to sag in placed due to the weight on the arm, but that is easily corrected if mounted right. The mounting screws are pretty soft metal, I stripped one out and had to use a grinder to buzz the head off to move the mount to correct for droop. The mount now has some grinder marks on it, but I don’t really care, it is for my work bench in the garage.I would use a better quality/harder wood screw and not waste time with the included ones."
4,"Easy as can be and for the price, you can't beat it.",Couldn't be easier to install and use. The price is at least half what you'll find in a store and many of those don't articulate.
4,Great bang for the buck,"Certainly not the fanciest monitor bracket, but an excellent value if you don't need any frills (or rotation). We purchased 2 for a dual monitor setup in our shipping/recieving area. Now we have additional bench space and the arms support the 21"" wide screens just fine."
2,Didn't work for me,"This mount was easy to attach and it was the ideal size for my 24"" monitor, but it wouldn't hold the weight, which is about 16 pounds, so I had to return it. When I called customer service to let them know the mount wasn't working, they suggested that I exchange it for the ML513B, so keep that in mind if you're trying to decide which model to get. I decided to get the ML530B instead, which is much larger, and depending on your TV, may block the ports at the back, but it's holding strong."
1,Buyer beware! Very poor quality construction.,"This mount looked like the perfect mount. It has lots of good features and pivots in all directions. The problem is poor construction quality. The first thing I noticed after mounting it was that the TV was very wobbly. I have mounted many flat screen TVs with other brackets and never had one wobble like this. I traced the movement to the pivot screw that holds the mounting plate to the arm. When I tried to tighten it the screw stripped out. When you consider that I was using the enclosed hex wrench that is only 3 1/2 inches long, how could I have applied excess force to it? Then, about a week later I noticed the top piece on the arm was broken completely off so the TV was hanging by only the screw. So the bracket is now in the garbage. This bracket is rated for 33 lbs. The TV I mounted to it weighs 19 lbs, well within the limit. So it wasn't a case of product abuse. Save yourself money and headaches and buy something else because this thing is junk!"
3,Cheap screws!,"The screws that came with the mount to secure the mount to the TV worked fine, but the ones that came with it to secure the mount to the wall were very cheap. I do quite a bit of woodworking and things like that and the screw heads on these screws stripped right out in seconds. I thought it was pretty pitiful the company would actually make a product like this and put cheaply made screws in it to secure it to the wall. Other than the screws I would recommend this mount, just go get some better screws before securing to the wall."
3,Angled display,"LCD mount has in and out adjustment and tilt adjustment, but does not allow any rotation of Monitor. Although the mounting hardware was perfectly verticle with a level, the screen was slightly angled because of the design of the screen tilt bolt assembly. If the angle could have been slightly adjusted, this would have been compensated for."
4,"solid, but no roll adjustment","This thing is solid and mounts up easily, but it does not allow any roll (ie pitch, yaw, roll) adjustment. When the arm is full articulated the alignment dips on one side."
3,Weak Hardware,"I purchased this to hold a 22"" LCD Monitor.The mount itself is fine and it holds the monitor firmly. As well is fairly adjustable.However, as some others have mentioned.DON'T use the screws that came with it.The top screw was completely stripped away in as little as 2-3 seconds and the screw was not even half way into the wall.Use your own wood screws and save the hassle."
2,screws dont tighten well.,"It gets 2 stars... The black powder coated finish is nice plus it does swivel as stated. Also like others have said, it wasn't level. In my case I was able to correct the leveling issue by just adjusting the screws on back of the tv.HOWEVER, as far as quality goes.. the screws dont tighten enough to prevent it from moving out of position. I'm using this on a boat and would of like to be able to adjust and lock the arm in a certain position but can't. Maybe I got a defective one? I will have to add some kind of strap so it doesn't slam back and forth over waves. The screws seem stripped and the arm is super fast (meaning it's really easy for it to swing back and forth with no resistant)."
5,Great Product FAST FAST SHIPPING HIGH QUALITY,"mounted my 24"" lcd tv with this mount in my bar and was easy to install with easy instructions and tools. Took less than 20 minutes. Make sure to measure the back of the tv for where the wall mount screws in. I had to customize my mount a bit with some brackets i had laying around to make it work but real quick fix. Overall the tv is still hanging on the wall great motion and tilt perfect for high places. Highly recommend this mount and seller for this mount!"
3,mounting difficulties,"this was one of the most annoying devices i have ever installed.it was almost impossible to get level, (the monitor, when hanging on the wall mount) but other than that it works great and at a price that is hard to beat.If you buy it have a little patience when installing, it will take a little more time to get it level based on the weight of the monitor when it is hanging out and the lack of support the arm provides.i would buy again and havent had any complaints after installing the product"
5,Best value available,"Most of the articulating wall mounts that I was looking at online were much more expensive than this, so I was glad to find this product and figured if I did not like it I could return it. I am VERY happy with it, in fact the computer screen is mounted to the wall right now and it is great. Don't bother paying more for another brand when this works just find and is a GREAT value. I highly recommend this product if your screen meets the VESA 100/75 specs and is within the size range."
4,Bang for the Buck,"Made in China, adequate for small TV's, limited adjustability, requires tweaking to make TV level. I guess that's why the bottom screw hole on the mounting bracket is elongated from left to right. Even if the bracket is perfectly plumb, the TV might not be. However, this inexpensive item is perfect for my application."
1,Didn't work,"I couldn't get the suction cup to stick no matter how hard I tried. The original one that came with my garmin worked fine, but this one's rubber was thicker and less pliable. The thing broke before I ever got it to work. Very disappointing."
3,HAVE TROUBLE WITH IT,CONTINUES TO BREAK OFF AT THE BALL JOINT. SENT THE FIRST ONE BACK AND THEY SENT ME ANOTHER. IT LASTED A FEW YEARS.
1,Did not hold my Garmin,"I put in the Garmin 1490 into the search for a suction count mount I could take for rental cars. I must not have looked close enough or the description was wrong. At any rate, it does not fit the Garmin 1490."
4,Perfect GPS Mount,Exactly what I wanted and works for me in my truck and my car. I recommend it to anyone who needs a window mount closer for viewing than on the dash board.
2,Inadequate....,"The suction this thing has does not feel very powerful. I don't trust it to hold up my $500 Garmin, and within my first 10 minutes of using it, it fell off my windshield to some bumps in the local road.I'm going to try the Arkon windshield mount. I have an Arkon mount for my cell phone and it's very secure in its hold."
1,Useless; broke after 3 days of use,This thing broke within 3 days. Backside holder rim broke and it cannot be fixed
3,Works... but not identical to original,"I bought this mount so I could have one for each of my vehicles. Unfortunately, it is not identical to the original mount in that the bottom portion of the cradle has a different tab (single versus double) than the original and does not pair as well with my Garmin Nuvi 1350LMT. It will work but it doesn't provide as secure a mount as the original."
1,Poor quality,Both suction cups ripped within 2 weeks! Used only a few times. Do not buy this product! Looking for refund.
2,Broke so fast,"Love my Garmin, but this product broke the first day we used it. The suction cup backing ripped off. Must've dried out and it couldn't be fixed. Disappointed."
1,Poor quality,"I used this mount for a few days, and then the suction cup at the bottom fell out of the mount. I've read some other reviews and see that this is a common problem. You get what you pay for, I'm afraid - this is a very cheap replacement and not built to last at all."
5,Garmin Suction Cup Mount,"I recently purchased a Garmin Nuvi 205W but it did not come with the factory suction cup mount. I looked at many different stores and was unable to find a factory mount. I came to amazon.com and found an inexpensive mount that fit my GPS perfectly. I got the product unsure if it was a factory suction cup or if it was aftermarket, but when i opened the package sure enough it was a factory part in original packaging in perfect condition. This was my first purchase from amazon and I must say it was a very pleasant one."
4,one of 2004's best ....,"There are some very excitable techno tracks on this disc, but it often steps outside the genre with its creativity and exceptional integration of vocals, be they human or computer generated. ""Wipe That Sound"" is perhaps the most immediately accessible song, although there doesn't appear to be one bad track present. The final track, ""Evoke an Object"" is also 8 minutes of electronic mastery. This is what I envision music of the future sounding like, and thankfully you can go out and buy it today."
1,This Phranc phanatic says stay phar away phrom this one!,"I'm a long time fan of Phranc, and was eagerly anticipating this new c.d. But this one is nasty! The songs sound as though they were being composed as she was singing them. Her voice sounds weak and quivery. The songs don't have the pleasant, catchy, sing-a-long quality of her early works. Save your money and check out her previous c.d.s I doubt I'll listen to (suffer through) this one again."
3,OK for the price,The price was right but not much to digest in new information or interest. I would not recommend that anyone spend the money on this product
5,ONE OF THE BEST !,"This is, without question, one of the best films ever done about the King. It's totally different than anything ever done on him. It really shows, in a warm, moving way, the great generosity and kindness Elvis exhibited throughout his life. The interviews with Elvis' good friend, George Klein, and the interviews with Elvis' jeweler, Lowell Hays are so moving and interesting. Every Elvis fan NEEDS to own this DVD."
1,Have any of you heard of Leo Kottke?????????,Put this album against anything from Leo Kottke and you'll understand what playing an acoustic guitar means. This album is a far cry from anything the previous reviews made me believe.
1,Synth Crap,"Not worth the price, even free. The sound is annoying and similar to every bad 80's B movie ever made."
1,poor quality,"cheap and poorly made.......I purchased this item, looked like poor quality for the price when it arrived but tried it anyway......bad choice and now it is beyond use. should have sent it back when I realized the poor quality."
2,Contact the Other Side,"I was rather disappointed with this book. I bought the other two (Vampires, summ. spirits) and was very thrilled. This book, however, did not live up to my expectations. This is not a book of rituals or some sort of necromancy. It's rather technological. ( that is the first part ) I wouldn't buy it if you are the romantic kind of magician. I would however recommened his other books. ( Nocturnal Witchcraft hasn't yet arrived at my home (Belgium) so I can't yet pass judgement on that.) If however, you are interested in the paranormal in wider context, I would suggest you buy it."
1,Gruesome!,"I've always been a huge Melba Moore fan. Frankly, I was appalled by this CD. The production is shockingly dreadful and Melba sounds even worse, pretty much butchering every song on this set. Maybe because this was done on a small, independent label, Moore was not able to secure talented producers who would bring out the best in her. This CD showcases Melba's voice at only a very small fraction of what it used to be. Do your fans a favor, Melba. Until you can get better material and great producers, spare us of garbage CDs like this one."
4,"Interesting read, too long","I have never read anything by Ken Follet before so I thought I would give him a try - I will read more of his work. I love historical fiction and did enjoy this book. I love sinking my teeth into a long book, but this one just seemd to go on to no end. It just become painful to read after awhile as the characters are brutalized every other chapter. I understand that this book is portraying a historical time where this was probably the case, but I just got tired reading about it."
1,Easier to build a cathedral than finish this book,"As a lover of historical fiction and 'Eye of the Needle', I was really looking forward to this book. More than disappointed, I was stunned. It seemed more like the work of a talented high school student. The book was actually goofy at times.The characters themselves have the depth of George Lucas creations. The plot connections between characters are clumsy, like a bad first attempt at Dicken's novel. The acts of cruelty wear the trappings of historical realism, but they are coupled with such juvenile inner dialogs that they are clearly there just to titilate the reader.Finally, you need the patience of a monk to tolerate the pace. Lovers of historical fiction are not afraid of long books. But unfortunately, the author and editor (if there was one) seemed to feel that the genre and audience relieved them of any responsibility to be disciplined and make choices."
2,Bizarre Obsession,"There is actually a lot that I like about the book - the characters, the sense of history, the twists of life that I think reflect what does happen in this world. There is a huge dislike - the obsession of the author on rape and violent sex. I actually pass over these parts now because they are so offensive and are so unnecessarily detailed in description that I get a sense that the author is enjoying himself. I feel almost like an unwilling witness that is forced to watch the painful acts. It gives me the creeps. I will finish the book - I am almost done. But I will skip the sequel. It's a bizarre feeling. The book would be so much better without the violent sex."
3,sexual and atheist pornography,"Though Follett is a talented storyteller, this book has no real purpose other than to reinforce his atheistic beliefs. There are amoral religious characters and the moral ones are eventually contradictory. His heros are anti-Christian, but to Follett's dismay, no doubt, provide real believers with proof of their ugliness. I can only imagine that scenes like the one where the ""witch"" Ellen urinates on the Bible are simply atheist pornography.The writing style isn't anything to write home about, but I can't really criticize that--this is a monumental work that deserves credit aside from the incessant porn.In the end, I'm still looking for a good historical fiction. By the way- I'm reading the bookMonacoand it's really good. It's prose more elloquent than poetry compared to Pillars"
5,Best book ever...period!,"If all of his books were as good as this one, Mr. Follett would be considered the greatest author of all time. Although its size looks imposing at first, the story will suck you in and will not let go...I found myself wishing it would go on forever. Better than ""Gone With the Wind."" Unquestionably the best book I have ever read."
1,Lame,"This book succeeds as a supermarket checkout pulp fiction page turner but fails utterly as literature. I did read it in a few days and didn't want to put it down. However, the writing is almost childish and the characters are frustratingly two dimensional. The story is decent but some of the plot lines are so sophmoric I had to laugh out loud at times. There is no deep meaning to the book, it has no texture and reads like a children's fairytale. If you like your characters to be either pure good or pure evil then you will enjoy this book."
2,Readers become voyeurs,I admit I've only gotten 200 pages into this thing. But I just feel a little prurient reading it any more.Time to go on to something more sophisticated.I think C.J. Sansom or Sharon Kay Penman are better at historical fiction.
3,Disappointed,Very interesting to start - then the story slows and meanders with the same characters and events - I am finding it hard to finish and easy to start reading something else.
4,The Pillars of the Earth,This book is unlike any which Follett wrote and will totally enrapt the reader. It appears that Follett did great research in the architecture of cathedrals in ancient times.
5,My second all time favorite book,I love this book. I travel a lot. I look at cathedrals and medieval architecture in a completely different light and frame of mind. A great historical novel.
1,Your Basic Mid-life Crisis Male Beach Read,"I'm in complete agreement with J. Leonard -- this is obviously targeted at 40+ males who want a little vicarious rape n' murder in their summer entertainment. When the male protagonist, moderately-pregnant wife and two kids in tow, meets up with the golden-eyed witchy woman early on in the book, I KNEW that within a couple of chapters, the aformentioned wife would be out of the way (all together, now -- ""Death by Childbirth""), and the protagonist and Witchy Woman would be ecstatically copulating. Feh.You want a thought-provoking historical novel? Read ""Galileo's Daughter."" Leave Follett for the subliterates."
5,A Great Read,"One of the best books I have ever read. You follow the lives of remarkable charachters as they survive and flourish to build a great medieval cathedral. The title has a double meaning reflecting not just the building materials but the character of the people needed to complete a huge project. I often give this book to young people to read.Ken KraetzerWhite Plains, NY"
1,Can't get past the first 100 pages,"I picked this book up this morning at the airport, thinking it might be a good read during a flight. A lady in the airport said it was the best book she's ever read. The cashier said I'd love it. I wanted to like it, I just can't, it's terrible. I read the first 80 pages during the flight and I'm going to have to get another book for the return flight. The writing is very lame; the descriptions of the characters would fit in bad Young Adult literature. The plot is so unrealistic. The guy's wife dies and he proposes to a new woman the very next day (after making love to her in a dream-like state the very night after his wife has died in child birth and he just finished burying her.) C'mon....really? I'm done. Don't waste your time reading this book...there is so much better out there."
5,"Wow, Oprah got this right, it's worth your time and that is saying something.","I picked this up at the library and read the first page out loud to my hubby and kids. I thought it was soooooo impressive that I was sure I'd love it. If you read the first page (you can do this online) and you love it, I promise, it's worth your time. If you don't love the first page, you may not love it.It's long, yes. It's also worth it. You won't read a chapter and wonder why it dragged out, hoping it 'came back around' later. It's wonderful. All of it.I will say that there are rape scenes which normally I find pointless and uncomfortable and evil. There is nothing worthless or pointless in this book. It all comes around, long before it ends. And even in the end, its worth the journey.I recommend this book to a lot of folks. I loved it and wish I could read it for the first time again."
5,My life is better off for having read this.,"One of the richest dramas I have ever consumed in any form. I fear for writing TOO much! At 1,000 pages, this is a beefy tome and yet I flew through it. It's easy to read with no loss of quality for it. Following the progression of the cathedral building was inspiring. Learning some about the time period was very interesting. But the tragedies and victories endured and won by everyone involved were spectacular! I actually started getting p****d off at the main villain halfway through the book. This guy terminally peed in everyone's Froot Loops to no end. The story was deep, covered many generations, and was just a joy to look forward to each day. Much of the human experience was packed into this book and described from many age ranges. I loved it. Just loved it!"
5,The Pillars of the Earth ( Deluxe Edition),Outstanding Book. I love Ken Follett and was astounded to learn he had written this.Our friends recommended it and I could not put it down. Read it for 6 hours one day.Everyone who has ever wondered what life was like for everyday people in the middle agesshould read this book.And its surprising that a self announced athiest should love cathedrals so much thathe spent much his spare time in life visiting them and studying their history.
2,300 pages too long.,This book had a good beginning and a good ending but dragged at times. I enjoyed Eye of the Needle more.
5,Worth every page,"Despite the somewhat slow start, Pillars of the Earth is an incredible novel. Its thickness can be intimidating, but it is worth every page. One experiences additional pride when finally finishing the novel. =) I think I liked the book because of its beautiful descriptions of cathedrals. The book also touches upon the evolution of cathedrals. (The main character, Tom Builder, is a mason who dreams of building the perfect cathedral.) But fortunately, you do not need to appreciate medieval cathedrals in order to appreciate this novel."
3,A bit slow paced.,"Pillars do the earth was well researched and certainly gains some perspective on middle age England, but it drags on a bit."
1,Language?,"Not good.I normally don't like to dog on other people's work... I mean, what have I done to give me such authority? Maybe it is because I started this book on the tail end of East of Eden. Perhaps it is just because it looks and smells like an epic. I'm not sure, but I do know this, this book reads like a high school sophomore wrote it. There are some times where I literally roll my eyes or shake my head as I read.Basically, I think it is a good premise. Even the plot isn't awful. The biggest complaint I have is with the language and storytelling. Most of the characters are two-dimensional or predictable. They don't shine. The treatment of sexuality is that of a 15 year old... it's overdone, awkward and slightly frenzied.I don't like to give up on books, which is why I am more than halfway done with this one. However, I couldn't guarantee that I will carry on until the end."
1,Don't waste your time...,It was my first time that I wanted to give up reading a book when I only have 1/10 left to read. sigh...
3,Not bad.,"I definitely enjoyed The Pillars. It is a good easy reading while on a plane or during long winter evenings. However, I would not call it a masterpiece. It reminded me of some Mexican soap operas, long, with strictly good or strictly bad characters and a sea of cheap emotions. I am sure it will make a very good plot for TV series. Housewives will love it. The language spoken by characters is definitely modern. It is not that they were supposed to speak the authentic 12th century English (we would understand nothing), but I doubt that they knew, say, the word ""mesmerized"". Despite some caveats, I should say that Mr. Follet did a great job. I will be pleased to recommend the book to my friends."
5,My favorite novel of all time,I love it because it is an epic novel with interesting characters set in a fascinating time.
5,The Best,"When people ask me my favorite book, this one is usually one of the top few choices. I didn't think I would finish it as soon as I did, but I couldn't put it down. The time setting is one of my favorite periods of English history and I've always been astounded by the size and architecture of cathedrals. This book takes a reader through virtually every emotion possible. After I finished it, I actually missed the characters in the book because they were presented so true to life."
2,Explicit X-rated sex,"Very disappointed with this otherwise good book. However, the detailed explicit X-rated sex scenes that describe in detail having sex with a virgin, and exploring women's breasts with ones mouth, are in my opinion too much for a historical book about building cathedrals to God.The wild woman and child in the woods is an atempt to insert year 2000 world views into year 1100 history. It fails.All Mormons and good Christians everwhere should avoid this extreme disappointment, Oprah Schmoprah."
1,just didn't do it for me,"I wanted a book to read during my holiday vacation. I never read Follett before, and trusted the ""Oprah Book Club"" sponsorship. But, after the first 40 pages . . . I find it hard to continue. There is minimal character development, rudimentary plot, and gratuitous violence. I am not a historian, and I am sure the era in which the story takes place was violent, but in this story there appears to be too much. I realize the story is centered on cathedrals, but Tom is way too hung up on it - a 12 century yuppie obsessed with their career. I don't know why many (too many in mu opinion) can give this book more than one star. Follett preface claims about the ten years to write hints at an epic story. But, I think the ten years was due to the book being an afterthought, something to write when there was nothing else to do - a hobby. Instead of trying to engage you in the character's lives, you seem to be a third party, a voyeuristic trip through binoculars."
1,"Oh, my God, what a catastrophe --","This author (if he can call himself that) writes for kindergartners. I was so appalled at his writing style -- I flipped through the book and sampled 4 pages and then gave it to the Salvation Army. If I could get my money back, that would be great. What a charlatan -- I saw an interview with Ken Follett and he looked and sounded intelligent. I was sorely mistaken."
4,Pillars of the Earth,I wish I had bought a hard copy and large print. It is a wonderful story. The giant paper back I have is uncomfortable to hold. you lnow it has over 1000 pages.Maybe a story that long would be easier to handle split into 3 or four books.A youngster would love this edition........... It is light print.I read in bed......Hard to get situated. Oh........... I took that Oprah thing off right away. I do not watch telly. I do not like her. I thought well before buying.........just because her name was on it. That is like she picked it out for me to read. Yuk!
4,A great read,"This was a good and descriptive time in history. The book brought to light some important facts about the earth's early beginnings. Though long, it was a page turner all the way through."
4,Highly recommend,"Lots of constant action, personalities and learning about the 1400's time period. A good reading to begin understanding the conflict in English society between people, the church and royalty. Highly recommend."
4,Splendid,"I was impressed with Follett's imaginative plotting, tight pacing, historical fidelity and crisp characterizations of good and evil. He succeeds in bringing you into that world 800 years ago where profound insecurity ruled--for food, shelter, a job. With murderous highwaymen, nonexistent policing, and corrupt clergy and royalty. Justice denied in a brutal, struggling society.But after the first 500 pages, this once sure-fire five star historical novel started to disappoint in failing to neatly wrap up the story. The second 500 pages should have been edited to 250--instead of a classic just a four star very enjoyable read."
4,Pillars of the Earth,Thoroughly engrossing. Ken Follett is an excellent storyteller. I loved the English history he wove into the narrative and I learned quite a lot about cathedral architecture!
5,Incredible,"This book is quite simply the best book I have read. The characters have so much depth, you feel like you actually know them. Plenty of twists and suprises, a very long book but very hard to put down!!"
1,hated this book....couldn't even finish it!,"This book had potential, but I couldn't get past all the graphic sex and violence. And beyond being graphic, it was twisted and disturbing. I'm not a prude, but this was disturbingly over the top. I don't understand how people loved this book, I had to put it down. It was awful!"
3,A Masterpiece?,"While this isn't a bad book, it is not even remotely close to being a masterpiece. The characters are mildly interesting and the plot is extremely redundant. Basically the plot consists of a monk trying to build a cathedral but unfortunately keeps getting frustrated by two characters. Every time he finds a way around it and every time the two characters find a new way to try and stop him. It gets so tiresome by the end. Fortunately there is a plot twist in the middle but its not enough to warrent calling this book a masterpiece.I did not think the book was horrible but I would not recommend it. Its almost a thousand pages of the same thing over and over again."
4,"Great fun, BUT...","This book was hard to put down, a real page turner; in a word, just plain FUN.That said, it was not what I expected. To call it a historical novel is giving it too much credit. The storylines are improbable to say the least; at times they are just plain stupid. The sex scenes are way over the top to the extent that I think Follett might be a little perverted. Adding in the Thomas Beckett angle at the end felt like a clumsy attempt to give this thing a little credence. (It didn't work.) I am very surprised that this was an Oprah selection.So if you're the intellectual type looking for a good historical novel, skip this--it'll make you crazy. But if you're willing to sacrifice believability for a little escapism, this is your book."
5,A Vaulting Success!!,"Pillars of The Earth is a book that gives new meaning to reading. It is a sweeping saga of gigantic proportions. It is a chronicle of the creation of the masterpiece cathedrals of the Middle Ages. It is a tale of good and evil and the price one is willing to pay in order to get the upper hand of power. It is a look inside the workings of the church from the most lowly monk to the most powerful bishop. It is a story of battles, knights, monks, masons,and villagers who all , in their own way, helped in the construction of the massive medieval cathedrals.This is a novel that has something for everyone. The impact that it had on me was as massive as the gigantic stone structures that rose as I read. I will never look at any cathedral in the same way as long as I live."
5,Fantastic read!,"This book surpassed my expectations, and I have also lost sleep reading into the wee hours. I only wish it were longer, because I don't want it to end. I have about 100 pages to go, and I have finally slowed down a little in order to savor the last bit. One of the very best books I've ever read."
3,"Good book, but way too long","Admittedly, I'm not a historical fiction fan, but this was a book recommended by my book club. I was pleasantly surprised in general. The book was well written and kept my interest. The were a few main characters and many, many, minor characters who all seem to have their own story line. It became quite difficult to keep all the good guys and bad guys straight in my head. Which King/Archbishop was good, which ones were bad. I thought the book was very long. Towards the end, I had to compel myself to continue just for the sake of continuing. I think the perhaps the descriptions of the building and construction progress were just a little bit lengthy for my taste. Overall, it was a good book, but not sure I would read another of this length though."
1,Missing pages,Very disappointed that 32 pages were missing in this copy of Pillars of the Earth! And 32 pages were duplicated later! Of course the missing pages came at a pivotal part of the plot. I have never seen this happen before.
2,needs more about the cathedral and less sex/ violence,"I agree with previous reviews - too much sex and violence, not enough about the cathedral. The characters are interesting, but the story lines left me unsatisfied. Seven-eighths of the book builds up a story; then the last eighth wraps it up in a contrived, lacking way. Speech flops back and forth between historical and modern usages, the author switches between elaborate details and cursory explanations, and parts of the book are incredibly boring. I don't usually like the author's book, but I love historical fiction about this region and this time. The book was a disappointment. I'm glad I chose to buy the discounted version, and not the deluxe version. Disturbing descriptions of rape and murder - the descriptions contribute little to the plot. Descriptions of sex are gratuitous and graphic - they made me feel dirty and made me think even less of the author. Completely detracted from the book, in my mind."
2,Very elementary writing style.,"I've read other Ken Follet novels. Some I have enjoyed, some I haven't, but I don't remember him ever writing is such a juvenile style. Much of the construction could have been written by a 14 year old. The story line is interesting, but it is too long. He uses the same tragedy 3 or 4 times. It gets much to technical about the architecture of the catherdrals, though that period of history does hold your interest."
5,Very good book,"This was an easy read and I really enjoyed the story. The author made it very easy to put yourself in the time period of the book and everytime I thought I had the plot figured out, it would completely surprise me! Will probably read again at some point."
3,Pillars needs trimming,"If you want to learn more than you need to know about building a cathedral, and/or life in medieval Europe, this is the book for you. It is, in many ways, a page-turner, and you do get involved with the many compelling characters and events in the story, but there are just too many pages to turn. This novel would have been greatly improved by carefully trimming it about 25%. Follett is a good story teller, but not a great one, and knowing what to leave out of an epic tale like this, is just as important as knowing what to include. There is no denying the fact that he did his homework on both the major themes of architecture and life in the eleventh century. It's just that when he started creating characters and contraversy, he didn't know when to stop."
1,"Terrible, couldn't finish it","Poorly written, with one-dimensional characters, I usually hate not finishing a book, but I couldn't keep going with this one."
1,"Bad History, Bad Engineering","This book probably seems accurate to people who know nothing about history, medieval building techniques or traditional monastic life. I didn't find the novel compelling as fiction, and I found it painful that so many reviewers claim to have learned from this piece of trash. It was predictable and boring, overly long and hardly stimulating."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"I just finished this book last night, and boy am I exhausted. I agree with most of the reviews that it is a riveting story and a page turner, but it is definitely not the greatest piece of literature ever written. The book has so many pages, because the author spends too much time retelling previous events and how they relate to the current ones, as if the reader has no memory. His foreshadowing is completely blatant; I would read ""ominous"" thoughts and dialogue and would know immediately what was coming next or how a certain story line would play out. With all that said, I was compelled to finish the book as fast as I could, and I spent many nights up late trying to finish segments. The character development was great and I really came to like the ""good guys"" and loathe the ""bad guys"". It was great fun, but I'm glad it's over."
2,About 400 pages too long...,"And with that title I am not saying that I do not enjoy a long, epic tale. War and Peace felt like Of Mice and Men to me, so seamless was the writing. Follett, however, writes like an eighth grader, and at times the prose was so akward and cliche smeared, and the actions and thoughts of the characters so disparagingly over-written that I wasn't just annoyed, I was insulted. Follett seems to believe that the fans of his mystery novels would be his readers here, though his subject matter is a drastic departure. This is where the book fails miserably. A well crafted story, some believable and well-motivated and depicted characters are lost and swallowed whole by horrific writing, anachronistic language, and far too much monotonous and unnecessary over-description. Shame - with a proper editor and a little restraint, this could have been a wonderful novel."
5,"I agree, the best book ever",Just take a look at all the people who keep this book at the top of their list. It is truly the best. I give 10-12 copies a year as gifts and everyone tells me it was their all-time favorite too.
1,Way overrated,"I guess if oprah says it's a best seller, then it is, what's wrong with America - what oprah says is far from Gospel. I couldn't get past the first 75 pages, it is written like modern fiction, but it is supposed to be a historical novel? Not quite. Don't waste your money - go to the library if you must."
3,Good read,This book was a good read. I would recommend it especially if you like the style of Ken Follett.
4,a good long vacation read,"Reading this book was like being under a spell placed by Ellen, the ""witch"" of the story. I loved it! I feel like I could converse with the characters. While the language is not historically accurate, this actually makes the book more accessible. If you have a week on the beach, this is the book for you. I took it on the plane, by the pool, on the beach and couldn't put it down. Yes, it's predictable, but it's worth the read. I've been looking up many of the historical references now to see what's true.The only negative is the book's literary value. As you may know, the book is plot driven, and if you're looking for challenging vocabulary and sharp writing, you won't find that here. Instead, sit back, put some sunscreen on, grab a margarita, and read away for the next week or so. Make sure you have a comfortable chair; my back started to hurt because I couldn't stop reading."
5,terrific historic novel,"I absolutely loved this book! The author makes the characters come alive, as well as the setting. You actually feel as tho you are there the description is so amazing. And I was rooting for Tom to finish his amazing undertaking in building the cathedral, at the same time wondered if it would ever get done with so many forces working against him. This is a long book, yes, but so worth the read!"
1,The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett,"The book was returned to the warehouse marked ""wrong address"" and a refund was processed. Expectations were not met for this order with Blackcastlebooks and Media on Amazon. I am not satisfied with this transaction. I responded with feedback and you did not address my concerns. You did not make this right. If you take customer service quite seriously and I haven't had a 5 star experience then this would have been corrected. The breakdown was with Blackcastlebooks completing the wrong address label and keeping my postage due to their error. My refund is off by $5.87. I kept the confirmation and the information I entered into the system at the time of the order was correct."
4,Historical thriller,"I liked ""Pillars of the Earth"". Though long, it was never boring - quite the opposite, in fact. I was disappointed that the work lacked the thematic depth suggested by the title. I was also frequently confused by the cathedral terminology. While I'm interested in the Middle Ages, I'm not an architectural scholar. ""Pillars"" is very interesting in its depiction of daily lives - usual or otherwise. Suggested for entertainment over enlightenment. Perhaps ""Pillars"" is part of a new genre - the historical thriller."
2,movies characters in the middle ages,About half way through the 1087 pages of the book I found myself thinking about the author as much as the characters. Where was the passion and mysticism of the times? Where were inspired and lofty thoughts arriving from middle ages faith? Perhaps the author does not believe in these things and couldnt imagine them.The plot and detail about the middle ages are interesting.But the wooden characters seem to reflect the amoral and secular people of our times and are cast backwards into the middle ages. This is Hollywood stuff.Perhaps the book was meant to be made into a film.
1,I have read better stories....,This was a waste of my money and time. There are previous one star reviews on this that echo my thoughts. It would be repetitive to state the same things again. I cannot believe this was recommended to me.
4,Wonderful! I fell in love with it!,I always love reading a series of historical adventuresjust like this book. It is a start of your another journeyfollowed a great scale and various characters and excithingadventures. Please take a rest while you are into it over numerous nights!!!
5,Cover to cover the best book I have ever read!...,"This book is in one word, outstanding. Before I decide to read an entire book, I always read the first chapter to see if it catches my eye. With this book, I needed only to read the first few lines to know I was going to finish it. From page one until the close of the book, I was captivated by the way Ken Follett writes the book. I felt like I was in the middle ages right there with the characters. The book was like a two week movie for me. It took over my life because I could not put it down. I will admit, there was one time that I did not like the book, in fact I hated the book. That time was when I had finished the last page, and realized sadly, that it was over. If I could give this book ten stars, I would."
3,"Follet is good, but medieval history is not his genre","I must say that this book was a fun read, but much of Follet's dialogue and characterization were not in keeping with the time period. It was evident that he has done his homework, for a good portion of the historical facts are accurate. However, it sometimes seems that Follet shows off his knowledge by simply telling about the way things were, but not integrating the concepts he introduces into the lives of his characters. For a true master of the medieval period, try Sharon Kay Penman and her trilogy of Here be Dragons, Falls the Shadow, and The Reckoning."
5,This is a must read for anyone who enjoys history.,You will be transported to another time and place. You will see the world through the eyes of the ordinary people who lived there. This isn't a history about kings and wars. It is a powerful story aout people who may have been our ancestors. Be sure you have plenty of reading time before you pick up this book. I didn't do much of anything else until it was (sadly) finished. I am in eternal search for another book this good.
2,A little too much,"I like historical fiction and have read all of the brilliant books of Patrick O'Brian and Ellis Peters. I have never read Follett before and picked up this book on a friends recommendation.It's pleasant enough to read. I noticed that a lot of reviewers found the book to be informative concerning cathedral building, but there is much less information here than in the great childrens' book on cathedrals by David Macaulay.However, the feature of the book that started to alienate me was the gratuitous sex. It's like the author wrote the book without any sex scenes, and then went back and inserted them every thirty or so pages to keep the reader interested. Rarely do they set a scene or further the narrative. And in all of them, the participants have sex five times in an hour and the women always have an uncountable number of multiple orgasms.It isn't offensive by any means - it's just like a car with too much chrome added on."
1,"long, boring, painful","I picked up this book with high hopes of a ""great read"" over Christmas break. Oprah raved about it...and so did some of the reviews. I TRIED SO HARD to enjoy this book. But it dragged on and on, the plot never really ufolded into anything new or interesting and the characters were flat and one dimentional. This book had great opportunity, but fell short in every area. If it were half as long and half as violent and brutal....it could have hope. Don't waste your time on this TOO long, boring book. Very disappointing. My husband also read it and agrees with my review."
3,Not sure why Oprah chose this book!,"I just finished reading this book and I was really disappointed. The book is pretty much two dimensional. The characters are flat, and he seems to rush through the stories he's telling about each character. They needed to be richer and deeper. I don't know who edited this for him, but they didn't do Mr Follett any favors. He needed better guidance. I wanted to love this book, and I just didn't. It's okay. It's an easy read. No need to be put off by the number of pages you have to read through. I just wanted more and it wasn't there."
2,Could not get into this book,Sounded like the makings of a good book... and I really tried but just could not get into this book... maybe got in 200 pages and gave up. Writing seemed so cheesy too...
2,Follet is losing it,"This book had some interesting passages, but is in dire need of a competent editor. The ~1,000 pages should have been cut in half. Full of info-dump narratives about building a cathedral, and so on. The author's research floods too much of this work of fiction. Follet should have paid more attention to Hemingway's advice about leaving something out when he knows about it.The book lacks a strong plot-line and just rambles along episodically over several decades in time. Worse, Follet never misses the chance to tell the reader what his characters are thinking and doing -- often several times, just in case we're too dull to catch it the first time.The villains are two-dimensional, and, coincidentally, two of them repent and become humble monks in the ending. Unbelievable. Try ""The Man from St. Petersburg"" or just about any early Follet work instead of this one."
2,Undemanding,"This is a workmanlike historical thriller. A fair amount of effort has been put into the setting, and the book is a reasonable page turner - but it has some important flaws.As a work of literature the book has serious faults. The plot and character development are both extremely one dimensional - the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad beyond belief. Neither learn anything or develop much throughout the course of the book. If this isn't a problem for you, then you should love this book. Otherwise, these elements are likely to overcome the good stuff in the book and become frustrating."
3,"Good, not great","I am surprised Oprah chose this as a ""must read."" It is an interesting story, but hardly fabulous literature -- and it's long. If you haven't read Oprah's earlier selection, A Fine Balance, pick that up instead; it is a better use of your reading time. For historical fiction about religious art, a better read would be Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling or The Agony and the Ecstasy. Good reading!"
5,Grim but Hopeful,"This was a surprisingly good piece of fiction from Ken Follett. A departure from his usual second-rate techno thrillers, Pillars of the Earth is a harsh and realistic look at life for a peasant family in the middle ages. For those who think that life is tough because they can't afford the new toys they want, this novel will show you what real poverty is. It's a great anti-depressant. Good read!"
4,"prompt shipping, gift condition",Seller shipped items promptly and I received the books in a safe package that kept the books clean and in gift giving condition. Would purchase from again :)
3,Quicken Financial Planner,I thought I was the only one out there who was mystified by the lack of updates to Quicken Financial Planner. It was the best program of its kind and I have found nothing to replace the now useless planning tool.
5,Great Kids Movie,The animation is pretty nice. If you like comic books you'll love this story about a high school kid and his father who go around doing good. This is a nice treatment of good versus evil. I do not want to give too much info but I will say that the cast is great and the story is well done.
4,Teacher's Perspective,"For the past two years, I've used this workbook as a supplement to a high school course I teach called ""Medical Biology,"" which surveys both pathology and medical terminology. Every student has her/his own workbook. I've found that this is a valuable teaching tool. It is easy for the students to understand and has many photographs and illustrations to accompany the text. The only aspect of the book I do NOT like is that all the answers are provided in the margins of the pages. The authors provide a bookmark that they suggest the students use to cover the answers."
1,defective out of box,"I bought this last spring intending to use it right away, but got delayed and only just started to use it. Well it leaks badly at one of the conectors where it joins the hose. Also the hose is very stiff and hard to straighen (and it's a much hotter than normal right now). It hasn't kinked on me yet: a plus. Too bad they didn't bother to test it before sending it to Amazon. If I was still in the return period I'd just send it back. I guess I could contact the manufacturer and see if they'd replace it but it's a hassle as the nearest post office is a long ways away from me and returning the hose end would cost as much as a repair part, so I'm here to find a repair kit for a brand new hose. If you intend to test it right away you can always return it but don't delay like I did. I will look for a different brand next time."
5,Sturdy,"What can I say -- it's just a hose. It's well constructed and sturdy, but not so heavy that it's too hard to drag around the yard, even when I've got the full 100' pulled out."
3,Gilmour hose,This flexogen hose is not as flexable at cold temps as my other ones. Did they change how they are manufactured??????Hose is still going strong ! Great product 4/2008
5,Excellent Lifetime Replacement Policy,"In addition to its excellent quality and dependability, the Gilmour Flexogen is backed by Gilmour's Lifetime Replacement Policy which states; ""A Gilmour product will provide complete satisfaction for the life of the product or it will be replaced free of charge. For replacement of an unsatisfactory flexogen hose, cut off both ends of the hose and send to: Robert Bosch Consumer Service, One Sprinkler Lane, Peoria, IL 61615. Be sure to include your name, address (not a P.O. Box), diameter and length of the hose and a brief description of the problem you are having. A replacement hose will be shipped approximately two (2) weeks after your information is received.""I highly recommend this product.*** Critical Note: Do not use the old Gilmour address. According to Robert Bosch consumer service, requests sent to the old address will delay replacement by 30 to 60 days. This is a result of the resent purchase of Gilmour by the Robert Bosch Company."
2,The tv show is much better.,"This movie could give an excelent series a bad name. The first 15 minutes of the film will confuse the hell out of you if you know nothing about ranma. The opening chase scene has every character ever created from the series. The plot is half boy/girl (Ranma has a transformation curse hence the tittle ranma 1/2) goes to rescue tempermental fiance. since first impressions are lasting impressions please do not let this be your first ranma tittle. Collect everything else Ranma, but stay away from this abomination that dares to defile the name of this classic series."
3,Important work should be easier to read,"This is a very well-documented account of how one American business giant profited from WWII and the Holocaust. (In fact, with the breadth and volume of sources cited it is hard to understand why some reviewers question the book's central thesis.) The author requests that readers not skip around and read the book in its entirety. Much of the historical info (especially the early history of IBM) is quite interesting but honoring Mr. Black's request is a bit challenging. The accounts tend to be somewhat repetitive and could be organized better. Still, this is a very important work by a very thorough writer. If you can manage to read (study) this work from start to finish, you no doubt will have learned a great deal."
4,Very cute,A very unique and cute birdhouse. The service was excellent and the birdhouse actually arrived a day earlier than expected.
3,Caters to the monied elite readers and plastic surgery advertisers,"This used to be a pretty good magazine, but now it panders to the botox and tooth whitening advertisers to such an extent that the editorial side of this publication consists of nothing more than self-congratulatory ""aren't the Twin Cities special"" pap that could only appeal to wealthy, white, 60-year-old suburban Twin Cities women with self-esteem issues.It's cover-to-cover milquetoast, serving no other purpose than to showcase all those plastic surgeons' ads on their waiting room coffee tables. This publication is just vapid and uninspired nothingness."
2,Off-Key,"There are two basic considerations in recorded music: how good is the music, and how good is the recording? The enjoyment of music, even great music, is diminished if the quality of the recording is compromised. That's why I am such a big fan of Mapleshade Records, whose recordings (as to the engineering or sound-quality) are almost always GREAT. I wish all record companies cared as much about sound quality! However, SOME of the Mapleshade records--including this one--are not so great musically (at least for my tastes).This CD has excellent sound-quality, but I have a hard time listening to the music. I have a little concern about its tempo and the song selection, but the biggest problem is that Shank sings just a bit off pitch throughout most of the record--and it annoys. This is an excellent recording of an off-key performance."
2,Works well if it feels like it,"Works well when it wants to. 2 issues:There is no way to get the fax to fire up if you happen to pick up an extension. I called and tech support verified. Other faxes allow you to dial 123, or #1, or some other code to manually kick the fax into action. On this unit, all you can do is RUN to the machine and hit the ""start"" button, or, hang up and wait for the faxing party to redial, and remember not to answer the phone.I am also getting the phantom error messages on ink cartridge. In my case, it is yellow. Sometimes it claims I have multiple yellows installed, other times it claims it is missing. Canon is sending a replacement, but it looks like this is not an isolated problem. Canon tech service claims it is rare, but look at the reviews!"
2,Too Many Problems in the Long Run,"I've had this printer for about six months and I'm packing it up for return. Simply put, the problems outweight the plusses.Pros: the duplex is great, reasonably fast, ink is easy to replace.Cons: the ""Feed Switch"" which is supposed to direct printing to either the cassette or the auto sheet feeder often malfunctions, resulting in your printing on the wrong media. This can be darn expensive if you intended to print on plain white paper in the casette and the printer inexplicably eats expensive stationery loaded in the feeder. Envelope printing is terrible-- it smudges every envelope and puts black marks on the front edge; fax function works poorly, if at all; software is virtually useless-- especially compared to HPs. This printer also drinks ink."
3,Slow....Scanner not as expected....,Its a shame I put my prior printer to rest after purchasing this one....The printing speeds Black/Color are dreadful....and the scanned images are sub par.....I do appreciate the feeder options and have had no problem with ink levels yet...the decision is up to you...but I would pick a better product next time...
1,Don't buy this JUNK!!!!!,I have had this printer for almost a year and have spent more money on the ink tanks than the printer itself. It constantly gives error messages about the ink......this is low.....that is low....its in the wrong spot....then after taking it out and putting it in again....it will print a few pages and next day the same thing. Sometime I would not touch it and few days later it would start working again.Once I repalced all the tanks at once just to see what happens. It worked for two day and the same thing started...............This is the WORST printer I EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Solid, could be better",Every function I have used works good. I do wish the black print would be a little more black (compared to my HP932c it is a bit gray). Otherwise everything works very well and is a pleasure to use.
2,just ok,"Printing quality is good and it's a good looking machine. That's the best thing I can say about this item. It is not intuitive to use, too complex, it's slow and it's too big. I should have done better research."
3,"Decent printer, very expensive cartridges","I wanted an all-in-one printer that printed graphics and paintings well, and included a good scanner, and could also fax in a pinch. This device fits that bill (although the color on the scanner is a little jacked sometimes).The printer takes a long time to get started, but once it goes, it prints quickly enough. I like the way the feeds work and I haven't had a jam. I've printed watercolors with this, and the look like they were hand painted. I'm completely satisfied with the quality. I don't print photos, as I think it is a lot faster easier and cheaper to let Snapfish or Kodak do that for me, but for art projects, it is great.The problem with this printer is that the cartridges are ridiculously expensive. Replacing all 5 cartridges costs at least $50. That is crazy! In addition, refilling cartridges is difficult due to their rather draconian chips. I'm not sure what brand is better, but buyer beware the cartridges on this otherwise nice product."
2,Poor quality photo printing & lots of ink problems,"I have experienced nothing but hassles with my Canon 580 since I bought it. I'd hardly used the printer when the indicator said I needed to ""check ink."" It doesn't *always* say that, but it does again now, and it won't even let me scan a document because I need to ""check ink"" again -- though no ink is necessary for creating a digital file!! I've also been very disappointed with the quality of photo prints it produces. I wish I'd ignored Consumer Reports and gotten another HP all-in-one..."
3,Great While It Works if you don't mind buying tons of ink,"After less than a year started making a noise like a jackhammer everytime I printed or copied or got a fax (including spam). Eats ink like crazy, including color ink for grayscale printing. Worked fine for 10 months and still faxes and scans fine. Prints alright as well, just super noisy and goes through ink really fast. Unlike the HP equivalent, has a document feeder, which works great. Just know it won't last you that long.UPDATE MAY 2008 -- The automatic document feeder has now died. Time to replace this. Toyed with getting a monochrome laser all-in-one but at least the Pixma ink cartridges work in other Pixma models, so am trying an upgrade and praying it's sturdier than this one was."
5,Working Great,"The Pixma MP530 quickly connected and operated properly on a PC running Windows, and a Mac running both Vista and Mac OS 10.4.11. It will take some time to see how the ink cartridges hold out, but so far they seem to be doing fine."
4,"Great Printer, but bigger than I expected","I have been using this printer/all in one for about two months now and it is great. It prints, copies, and scans with great precision. I was suprised when I got it at how big it was, but it does not really bother me now. If you are looking for a compact all in one, this is not for you. I have it sitting on a file cabinet and it hangs over the sides."
4,18 months before problems,"I purchased this printer in Sept 07 and have loved it until the past 2 months. It is a real plus that the ink tanks are all separate so that there is no waste of ink as in the ""tricolor tanks"". The disappointing change is that it is printing a black racing stripe on the back of the sheets. Sometimes this is as wide as 1/2"". I am reading that this is a common problem with this model and takes 2-3 hours of time to dismantle the machine, clean it and re-assemble everything. I have run all of the cleaning functions but still have the stripe. Otherwise, it has been a great multi-funtional printer. As soon as I use up my ink cartridges I will be moving to another Canon printer."
4,Great All in One,"Perfect for a home office, with an additional bonus of printing pretty good photos. Great Printer, Scanner and Fax.The only issue I had was getting this to work with an older version of XP service pack 2. I had a 5 year old PC that had been patched, and repatched, with XP sp 2 updates. This caused the PC to not recognize the Canon drivers...even though I was previously using a Canon 8400F with no problems (Canon said the issue was the printer drivers).As timing had it, I had to upgrade to a new PC anyways, and the drivers installed beautifully on the new machine...validating what Canon support had told me about XP patches. Very happy about this purchase. Was also looking at the MP830, but I just didn't need that much machine, or the display."
5,Great printer...,"The print quality of this printer is great, especially when the price is factored in. I use it for everything and it prints great pictures."
2,Not as good as some have posted,"I've had this printer for about 3 years now. I hate buy new printers because there expensive and you don't know what your going to get. I researched before I bought and wound up with this. It was highly recommended. Why can't any printer company sell a bullet proof printer? Now I'm back researching.This printer has issues with ink. I don't print much and everytime I use it there's an issue. Ink is WAY to expensive and if you even try to recieve a fax or print a B&W; document and a color cartridge is low, forget about printing anything. I just defaults and doesn't do a thing till you get a new one. Can't even trick it into thinking theres a new one in there. Faxing? As previous poster said it has issuses. If you like to fax stuff don't bother with this one. After about 6 months it's been making this god awful noise with gears grinding. Thought for sure it would break but, it keeps going. The search continues..."
4,Great home printer,"We bought this printer 18 months ago and it has been great. All of the features work well, although we are mostly using the print, copy and photo printer features with occasional scanning. The ink seems to run out somewhat quickly but the replacements are not too expensive and pretty available. It suits our needs and has not disappointed so far."
1,Some times malfunction,"Some times when I push the enter button it does not work, or do I need to push it several times.Also, you must be awake to enter the hour you want it to be started. For example, if you want it to start at 3 AM in the morning, you must be awake to do this."
4,Works as advertised,"After going through a couple of similar units from my local hardware store in just over a year, I decided to buy this guy based on the positive reviews. I have not been disappointed. While it doesn't have quite as many options as some of the other timers, I'm looking for something that is going to last more than one season, and it looks like I found it."
2,Do not buy,I bought 3 of these timers and they worked great for a year and a half. I checked them to see that they were working properly and found that none of them were working. I put in new batteries and found that none of the timers worked. They lasted less than a year and a half. I called the manufacturer and they said the warrenty was only good for a year. In the trash they went.
1,skip it,"One of the worst purchases I've made. Bought 2, 1 never even turned on, returned it. Neither the other nor the replacement worked properly. I have a lot of experience with garden water timers and did everything correctly. Poor quality."
1,Worked well...until 3 weeks after warranty expired!,"I am joining the great company of reviewers who bought this item only to have it fail about 3 weeks after the warranty expired. Like everyone else, mine would not shut off. Just to make sure it was not the batteries, I removed them and tested them with a voltmeter - both about 1.52 volts (ie plenty of charge left). I hope I did not throw away the old timer it replaced which while a little less nice ran for at least 4 years before I took it out."
2,I have tried several of these-not good,"Over a three year period I have tried several of these but none lasted over three months. Moisture condenses inside and the circuit board fries. I have been careful to keep them covered, out of the rain & off the ground but result is the same.There is an obvious design flaw in isolating the circuit board. I thought it was the seal where the batteries go but it's more than that one place. The problem seems to be inside where the ball valve erodes the gasket separating it from the electronics.For the short period of time it works great but not worth the price for such a short lived and poorly designed product."
3,Basic timer!,This is a good basic timer but......beaware that you can not create your own start time (i.e.it starts when you turn it on). So far it has worked as stated and is easy to program but you will be up early in the morning if you want a pre-dawn start time! Good flexibility in both the time (length) of watering and the frequency.
1,could have given it a zero,"i bought this timer about 6 months ago as a replacement for a better programmable one. after researching some, wanting to buy locally, and getting something not so expensive, i settled on this one. after reading reviews of several other gilmour timers, i concluded that many are affected by the elements (go figure). so i put a plastic bag over this one so it wouldn't be rained on (my last one broke because it was rained on and water got inside the supposedly sealed battery/electric compartment. well, this one broke too. i would not recommend gilmour timers. other products of theirs i have used have been fine, but not the timers. hopefully, i can write them and they will send me a refund, because i certainly don't want a replacement!"
4,Electronic water timers,"The Gilmour 9100 model is simple and reliable. I have used other timers with liquid crystal readouts from Gilmour and others and find that the displays generally die or partially die after about one year. The 9100 however seems to remain dry and working for much longer, (2 years and counting). I understand that it has only 1 cycle per day but for my needs this has proven adequate."
1,poor quality,i was disappointed with my Gilmour #9100 water timer. it would not consistently turn on/off after programming. the one year limited warranty states that transportation must be prepaid for replacement. what a joke! it's not worth the trouble. please look into the alternatives.
1,Save Your PLANTS..... DO NOT BUY THIS TIMER,You will spend a lot of time learning HOW to program this unit.You will hook it up and work out how to get it to NOT LEAK.You will turn the water on.Go away expecting it to work.It WILL FAIL you and your plants WILL SUFFER.Unimaginable they would release this unit for free much less SELL IT!
2,Broke after one season,A hairline crack developed in the side of the plastic covering around the valve after one year of use. Water now sprays out of the unit when the valve is in the closed position. It would be great if the pressure components of this unit were made of brass.
3,Jim Brickman,"I love the cds I got from you! They shipped fast and they looked nice, They also sounded great. I am a piano music lover and I thought those cds were great! Thank you very much. A++"
4,Good if not great,"Though the premise is a little tried and true with all of the CRASH copies that have come out in the last couple years, the cast and pull of the characters in this film make up for most of the predictability. Elizabeth Mitchell and Miranda Bailey are really great in this, making you care for characters that could easily be throw aways. Erik Paladino's storyline is by far the best. He sells every moment and the conclusion of the thread involving the kidnapped girl is a real stunner."
3,Good once received,"The first one received didn't have a wand. The second one's tube was too short. So, I assembled a complete one out of the two and sent the remainder back to Amazon. Amazon was great with the return and replacement!!"
2,Fun product but dismal quality,"I loved the picture, tray and how sturdy it all felt till the pieces started chipping frequently. It's a choking hazard with my two year old who just loves arranging all the horses and the background picture. I had to return the product and hoping the replacement is of better quality else this maybe the last puzzle that I will buy from Melissa and Doug."
3,I wish I hadn't bought this,My 4 year old loves puzzles and horses but I wish I hadn't bought this. I have younger children who are undoing things behind me so it's a pain that the puzzle isn't put away unless it's completed. The pieces are hard to fit together - the puzzle is listed as being hand crafted but I don't necessarily think that's a good things for puzzles.
3,She happy,My daugther was so surprised when she received this itme. Still playing with it and its well after christmas
3,Some good songs,"If you want the best of Clint, buy Killin' Time. Its really the only Clint Black that is essential, even though several other CDs of his are very good. The first Greatest Hits cd is good but left off several number one hits in order to justify a second greatest hits cd. And this is it. No suprise, the ""A"" material here is from Killin' Time (songs that should have been on the first greatest hits cd) and a few good ones from Tailights. The rest is average. The duets, as with most country male-female duets, are focused more on sappy lyrics than good music. This is a good cd but far from his best."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS BY FAR THE VERY WORST BANGO KAZOOIE GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE. BECAUSE OF THIS GAME I AM NEVER BUYING ABSOLUTELY NONE OF BANGO KAZOOIE MERCHANDISE.PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS, I BEG OF YOU. YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY. I WOULD GIVE IT NO STARS AT ALL BUT THE LOWEST I COULD DO IS ONE STAR."
5,The Definitive Recording,This is the most definitive performance of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. Its beauty and raw energy are truly unmatched.
5,"Pianomania, my life","Pianomania one of the best movies I have seen. I ordered several and give them as presents to my friends. A little bit self serving, because I am a piano tuner/technician myself and see me as the actor of this really entertaining DVD.It is entertaining to the non professional also and it is so hard to imagine where the fine line about ""Mania"" is starting."
4,Interesting to piano techs,"The trials and tribulations of a piano tuner/technician in dealing with the performing artists. Not for everyone, but if you are into pianos it is a good watch."
5,Wonderful,"I found it entertaining, amusing and informative. It was a delightful look into the life of high end pianos and players."
1,Would Give It Negative Stars - Junk,"Bought this June, 2011 and have used it just three times to spray garden weeds. It now leaks badly in two locations, so I called Gilmour and they said it comes with just a 90-day warranty. Sad, especailly so since it is made in the U.S.A. Don't waste your money/time on this product."
1,mis represented in ad,I bought this sprayer specifically because it was advertised to have an all brass adjustable spray tip. It does not. It has a plastic tip which was not satisfactory for my use. I sent it back
1,Just a sales pitch,I purchased this book in hopes of improving my skills as a sales recruiter. Before the end of the first chapter I wanted to take the salesMAP test myself to see how I would perform. It turns out that the test is not in the book but online and NOT part of the purchase price of the book. To give the test to prospective hires would require prepaying for the tests in lots. I quickly skimmed the remaining chapters and soon discovered that reading the rest of the book would only make me feel incapable of making a hiring decision without using salesMAP. I did not continue reading. I paid money for a 171 page sales brochure; not one of my best buys.
4,second read,I read this a long time ago and wanted to re-read it. Liked it better the first time. I still love her Darkover novels.
1,A Book for Gorks,"I have read some nonsense in my time... Wha? But this book is just dreadful. Only a complete jackass would put this book on their X-mas list... Wha? My friend Celine who is a complete nerd... Wha? would love this book, but that is it... Wha?"
2,"Novelty for games, not music.","I thought these were really cool when I first got them. The vibrating bass is really cool at first. Then you realize that the overall sound quality is very poor. When the vibration is turned off, there is absolutely no low end at all. Its all highs and mids. The battery life is very poor as well. I bought these for $30 and I still think I got ripped off. The vibration does not compare to real bass. There is only one ""feeling"" you get out of this that makes every bass line from every song seem the same. Real bass has different frequencies. They are alright for playing games or watching movies but definitely not for music.Bottom line they are cool at first, then you realize how much of a novelty they are. If you are looking for good sound, look somewhere else."
2,"Horribly designed, incredibly cheap, awful sound","Out of the box they don't look quite right, like they would break like a wishbone if used and once on your head they barely fit and are incredibly uncomfortable like they were designed to only fit children. I seriously spent a half hour disassembling and reassembling them because I assumed they must have been assembled wrong.With the subwoofer off they have virtually no bass and sound worse than the headphones you'd be given for free on an airplane. With the subwoofer on, they buzz horribly and muffle anything that isn't bass. The battery pack has a wheel to adjust the subwoofer volume, but its a joke and seems only to work at min or max.I have no idea where the good reviews are coming from. This is seriously the worst set of headphones I've ever owned. Save your money towards a good pair of SONY studio monitors or something that isn't just a marketing gimmick aimed at teenagers."
2,Not up to par,"I bought these thinking they would be sweet but they really are not that great of quality. The sound quality is that of regular old apple headphones. The ""built in subwoofer sucks."
4,Fits My Needs,"Overall amazing headphones. Great noise cancelling + the sub rocks. You can definitely tell there are gaps in frequency response but for what I need, which is snowboarding/class/making beats, they are really amazing for the price. Plus the bag they come with is nice as well."
5,Andrew,These are the best headphones i'v ever had. They have so much bass that they tickle your ears.
1,Not good for determined dogs.,"Thought this crate would be a good one for my 30lb Boston Terrier. My biggest concern was the door, but that proved not to be the case. Within 4 hours of being in the 28-Inch L by 21-Inch W by 22-Inch H Crate, he had chewed through the side. While the crate was the correct size for him, the plastic was not sturdy enough to keep him from chewing it apart. I would not recommend this crate for a dog that is determined to get out of a crate."
3,Good with modification,"This pet carrier is about what we expected. We bought this so that we would have something for our puppy to ride in when traveling. As some other reviews have stated, the clips used to hold the top and bottom together aren't that great but can be attached more securely by using bolts and washers. (I think somone else said the same thing.) If I was going to carry our pet anywhere using the handle I would get it bolted together better. Other than that issue, which is pretty important, we haven't had any problems with it and it was pretty easy to put together. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could but because of the potential for the top to detatch (easily fixed but should be made better) it got the 3 rating.We bought through Amazon and as usual no problem at all with that."
4,Warning- Twins are addictive,"Charlen Choi and Gillian Chung(aka. TWINS) are two of China's biggest pop idols. Don't let that discourage you,though, this movie is very well done. Performances are done well by all(maybe not perfect acting- but not horrible). The action is also done well- good fight scenes-not great cg. Jackie Chan scenes are, pretty much, filler- although they do add some comedy. Overall- I enjoyed the film. And if you're into cute Chinese pop duos- you will too. Remember- TWINS are addictive-beware."
5,Pleasently Surprised,"I happen to stumble upon this movie on Cable one evening. I wasn't expecting too much more from it than a campy kung foo movie. I have to admit that I was plesently surprised. Being a huge Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, this movie was a welcomed discovery. I had never heard of the pop group ""The Twins"" but you can tell that they have great chemistry together as this movie was very entertaining. It was funny, and slick and full of action. The story line really held my attention and the special effects were no less than excellent. After watching the movie I knew I had to have it for my DVD collection. Jackie Chan made a fun cameo that was right out of his own movies. You can tell he just has alot of fun with what he does. I highly recommend the Vampire Effect if your looking for a fun and exciting movie."
4,A great CD!,"This CD is not bad for the first in Totally Hits. Some of my favorites on here are ""No Scrubs"", ""Smooth"", ""Believe"", ""Nobody's Supposed To Be Here"", ""One Week"", ""Summer Girls"", and ""This Kiss"". All the others are good but not as good as the ones I mentioned. So if you buy this CD, skip some of the tracks that are not so good. I only listen to a few on here."
1,Defective Key Collars,"I've used these key collars from Staywell for several years. I've put together probably 10 of these collar keys purchased from Moore Pet Doors with no problems at all. I ordered six from Amazon in January 2010 and they are all defective. The ring will not fit into the slot for the key. I took them to Zales Jewelry Store and they filed out the opening so that they now work.I did write to Staywell/Petsafe several times with no response. The phone number was in UK so I didn't call it. I think there has been a recent sale of the company.I should point out that except for this defect on these specific collar keys, the infrared door and collar are excellent."
3,Unshocking!,"Amazing -- a book about traumatic injuries that neglects any discussion of shock. I've had to borrow my partner's anatomy & physiology text for that part. There's some good basic info here, but I'll need to look elsewhere (& you will too) for detailed information on the kinds of wounds a character might sustain in sword fights or the treatments your characters might receive before the advent of modern Western medical techniques. Better news if your story takes place in the contemporary urban industrial world, with a modern emergency room or trauma center. But when it comes down to it, for most situations, this book isn't going to replace every good writer's necessary tool: research, research, research."
4,"GREAT PICTURE, POOR SOUND, GREAT FOR PLAYING VIDEO GAMES","I purchased this tv to play video games on. I am very happy with the picture quality, however the sound is poor. I would not buy this if you want it for a primary tv, but it is nice for what i want it for. I have it placed next to a Sony LCD 42"" that i use to watch tv on. If you decide to buy this tv, check Walmart. I paid $199.00 + $17.00 for a 2 year extended warranty. The only drawback to this tv is that the picture is very small for us ""over 40"" crowd."
5,Insopro is awesome,"I rate this product very high because it is the same as another product on the market. The Phrase "" Eat carbs but look like you don't"" is what this product should be marketed as. I was purchasing Glucorell-R for 39.99 but this is the same product but much cheaper. Take one capsule 20-30 minutes before a high carb meal and it helps shuttle carbohydrates into your muscle cells instead of your fat cells by increasing insulin sensitivity and the uptake of glucose."
2,Artificial tasting,I was hoping to use this syrup to turn my sodastream diet cola into diet cherry cola. The end result tasted more like cough syrup than cherry cola.
3,"Good, but not as good as I thought","This product is good for sugar free flavoring, but not quite as good as I would have liked. I probably will not buy it again, and more than likely won't use what I have left, which is quite a bit. As I stated, it is pretty good, but not as good as I thought it would be. Disappointing."
2,Not the Greatest,"The information in this book was scattered around too much. I would have prefered there to be more information in each week about that specific week and all the medical info at the back (unless really pertaining to that week.) Also, the weeks didn't conform with the months. For example, my baby had just turned 7 months and was 30 wks. old. The book refered to 30 weeks as 8 months old and scared me into thinking my baby should be crawling at that age. Luckily I have other books that confirmed that at 7 months, most babies aren't crawling yet (though a few might be.)"
1,"Buy ""The Baby Book"" (Sears) instead!","Really quick...Do yourself a favor & leave this book on the shelf! I was so freaked out that my baby was behind on development! It really had me scared.""The Baby Book"" is right on and sooooo ""instinct friendly"" :O)"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this book because when I was pregnant I enjoyed reading Your Pregnancy Week by Week. Don't waste your money. All the bad reveiws on this page are spot-on. The only thing I have to add is that baby's develop SO differently, trying to monitor it week by week will drive you crazy. Especially when, like one reviewer pointed out, the milestones the author is claiming your child will be hitting is SO OFF."
5,Ignore some of the negative reviews and give this one a try!,"I have read a lot of baby books and I think this one IS well layed out and DOES support breastfeeding. Introducing solids at 4 months is NOT a bad thing, but readers and parents need to know that they DON'T have to do what a book tells them to. DO what you want based on YOUR child's development. And the book doesn't suggest switching from breast to formula. It suggests that at about 5 months you can, if you want to, introduce a bottle of breastmilk to a breast feed baby, not formula! The week by week lay out is helpful, but we ALL know that all babies develop differently and that your child is not always going to be a textbook baby! Gosh, people, lighten up!"
2,awful. totally concur with the existing bad reviews.,"i, too, bought this book because I liked the pregnancy version - but babies are just not as regimented as pregnancy. the advice, ostensibly written by doctors, is really off (e.g. solids at 4 months, a baby is supposed to be talking at 9 months, etc)."
4,"Your Baby's First Year: Week By Week (Your Pregnancy Series), Second Edition",The book is what it says. We received it as a gift after our first child and liked it so much we gave it to my sister after her first child.
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"This book is great. It is a guideline for everything that should be happening with your baby week by week. This week he should be ready to sit up, etc. This week he can play this game, see these colors from x inches away. For a first time mom, it really helps in terms of what to expect, and activities to play with your baby. I love this book and have given it to other new moms."
4,Soothing Music for a Relaxing Evening,I bought this CD on the recommendation from a friend in Australia. It is a perfect choice for those times when you just want to have a relaxing evening sipping some wine and unwinding from a hectic day. It is very lighthearted and soothing. My Aussie was right on the money with this one!
5,Up to Arkenstone's usual quality: superb!,"David Arkenstone is one of those rare artists whose albums I would buy without first having heard the first track. ""CELTIC BOOK OF DAYS"" was no exception: it was excellent from the first to the last. If you like Arkenstone, you will certainly not be dissappointed with this album."
1,New Age Drivel,"David is a fine composer. He's written some very lovely new age music. This is his attempt to jump onto the Celtic bandwagon and it fails miserably. Dirty Linen magazine tore this album to shreds. It barely registers as Celtic. There's no fire here, no spirit. It's like the Disney version of what Celtic music should be. David should stick to his etherial compositions and leave the Celtic music to those people who make a living at playing celtic music. This is an insult to musicians who spend years learning the nuances of Irish/Scottish music."
1,ArkenFart!,Give me a break...this is synthesizer filler with one finger wonder effects on a keyboard.Elevator for sure!
3,A Catchy Song,"This song is very catchy with a chorus that rivals any composed by Max Martin, wunderkind behind the Backstreet Boys et al. However, there are a few strained notes here and there, and the B-side of the single, written by the same team who composed 98's ""Because Of You"" and Gina G's ""Every Time I Fall"" seems a little forced. Something to keep an eye on."
3,Not what i remember. but not bad,"not sure if this game is even possible to win. im sure it is, but its a really difficult game. really repetitive but over all not too bad. good game for what i paid for it"
4,A fair intro to Patrick's New Age - without his best work!,"This is a compilation of much of the second-best music from Patrick O'Hearns first 5 albums. It does not include material from Trust, or Metaphor. It also does not include my favorites from the first 5. But it DOES give a good impression of what most of Patrick's music is like, and ""Sky Juice"" and the 3 songs from Indigo give good hints of what the best is like. So this album is an acceptable intro to Patrick's music. But for a better one just get the album Metaphor, and listen to it a bunch of times before you firmly make up your mind about it (you'll get really hooked on a couple of songs). OR, there is another compilation ""Private Music of Patrick O'Hearn"" that might be better."
4,Things I don't understand,"I never understood where Rob (Guy Pearce) was supposed to be in this and other episodes. What happened to the nasty Blackwoods of Balmoral? And I thought Emily MacGregor's maiden name was Cornish. Why then is her mother Jessie McCluskey? And what's more, why did she abandon her? I hope other episodes come out that will clear up these mysteries."
3,The quality of the sound is bad,"I bought ""themes"" by Vangelis too and there is a lot of difference between them. I just cannot understand why the quality is that bad. If you don't have other Vangelis CD's you may not notice the difference. Just because the songs are good, I give this CD 3 stars (it should normally deserve more)."
1,Very expensive piece of garbage,The pieces come loose and fall off at thge slightest touch. You can't have this thing strapped to your ear for more than a couple of hours without discomfort. Sound qulaity has distortion and is only a good headset in non-crowd situationds.I cannot fathom why this headset is so expensive. Run away.
3,Run Away!!!!!,"The good... Good sound, and comfortable in the ear and very easy to use.The bad... 1 hour of talk time. You cannot simply buy another power adapter for the earpiece, you have to buy that and the little plastic cylinder to have another charger.AND one question for all the manufacturers, other than Motorola. ""Have you ever heard of USB/Mini USB?"". I am sure we are all sick to the teeth of buying new cell phones and earpieces, only to find that the manufacturers, in an effort to extend their revenue streams, have created another completely different power connector.Bottom line, don't buy this, buy something with a decent battery life and a mini USB connector for power."
5,Bluetooth Cell Phone earpiece,"Love it. It works!! Easy to charge, very light weight, no ""over the ear"" holding devise. I like it mostly because of how small it is and that you hardly notice it is in your ear.I have been using the same devise for over 4 years. That's why I bought more of them."
4,Pretty good,I Like it alot. Sound quality is A+. Reception is great. Very light weight. Picks up my voice almost at a whisper in a quiet room. It has three different size ear pieces to fit perfect. On off function button doesn't push in much and doesn't click when you push it.It is hard to tell if you've pushed hard enough so I usually end up pushing harder than I probably should. Overall It's great
3,Comfortable; Horrible Charging System,"I bought this headset over a year ago and have enjoyed how comfortable it is but have struggled with how difficult it is to charge the unit. The unit comes with 3 different soft earpieces that are easy to swap to fit your ear the best, along with a loop to go around your ear that make it very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The major drawback I see to this unit is the charging system. I have tried many different ways to get it to sit in the charger correctly with little to no luck. If you're considering this headset, consider something that has a comfortable earpiece but a different charging system."
2,Discounted for a reason,Had high hopes for this headset as I spend lots of time on the road and use my Blacknerry 8700 prolifically for both phone & email. Had two major problems: 1) Kept loosing Bluetooth connection when I was in my car and and the phone was in a fixed location 2) everyone I called said that they were having a hard time hearing me through the severe static. Needless to say I returned this headset after 2 days.
1,Wouldn't buy it again,"The headset is very light and comfortable, with good sound quality. But it's flimsy, the ear piece comes loose easily, and the on/off button sticks. The charger is awful, there's a case full of parts and pieces that are hard to assemble and take apart again. The headset falls out of the charger easily. It's way too much trouble, and not worth the money."
3,Good performance and poor accessories,"Pros--Excellent sound quality, plenty of volume--Lightweight, comfortable--Easy to configureCons--No Samsung adapter. Charging phone with separate cable is awkward.--Headset often becomes loose and doesn't charge.--Case is too large to be portable.Overall the performance is excellent. The charger and other accessories are less impressive. Avoid this headset if your phone isn't included in the OEM adapters."
3,Great Sound but One Design Flaw,"I replaced a Motorola HS850 headset with this Discovery 640. The Motorola headset was barely audible even in my car, but the Discovery is plenty loud. Overall very happy with the form factor, sound quality and comfort. Have had no problems with the Bluetooth connection.The design flaw with this model is the charging cradle. It is a wonderful idea to be able to charge this unit with the Motorola or other chargers (or even an AAA battery). However, the headset does not snap into the charger firmly--it mainly relies on gravity to maintain electrical contact with the cradle. If it tips ever so slightly to the wrong angle it can lose contact and the hours you thought were spent charging your headset were really doing nothing at all. That is a big flaw."
3,a couple of problems make this a so-so headset,"Pros: It's small, and it has a cool system for charging either from the wall or from a battery for on the go. It usually connects well with my treo 650Cons: Sound quality isn't that great (it always sounds like someone is crinkling up cellophane in the background). The receptacle that the headset sits in when charging is poorly designed, it is constantly falling out because the socket on the headset doesn't securely sit in the plug in the carrying receptacle. Even when it's just sitting there recharging it will pop out. I'm surprised that this poor socket design passed their tests"
2,missing screw,after light use and short span of time this product didnt last enough. bad bad bad no good nope fewwy
1,Not What You Hope,"To begin with, this so called West Point Band is obviously not connected with the United States Military Academy. The cornets play in a British like sing-song style (I would suspect it is a foreign band) and the snare drummer beats out eighth notes in machine=gun style. There is no dynamic contrast. But again, beware of the band's name and don't mistake it for the USMA, because it is far from it, and I think it is most misleading, Not Recomended!"
1,NOT JIM MORRISON,"This book is NOT by Jim Morrison of the Doors, This is some clown that changed his name to sell some books...what a rip off!!!!! Absolutely disgusting!!!"
4,A Hard Read,"This book was an uncomfortable read, but I felt something that should be read in order to truly understand this marriage. You really get the sense of how much Laura really changed George and how he probably would not have even been a governor without her. God really used her to change him around. He still has rough edges, but he still did a 180. I gave it a four instead of a five because of all the ugly incidents that were dragged out and it's possible some of them may be embellishments. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would rather not read anything that puts President in bad light, truth or no."
4,Excellent little lens,"I bought my Nikon D600 with the 24-85mm VR G kit lens, which is excellent. To reduce weight in city scape situations I purchased the 24mm prime lens. It's fast and has a great (NON-plastic) feel to it. So far, very happy.I'll upload a pic, which shows a difference between this prime and the zoom (both at 24mm at 1/60 at f5.6)"
4,Great event lens,"I have a slightly older version of this lens (pre D), but the important point I want to make is the same: This is a great prime lens for events and general shooting on a cropped DSLR. On a D70 (what I have) it acts like a 36mm with the crop factor. It is wide enough to take shots of groups but not so wide that you can't get a nice portrait.But, this is for people like me who prefer prime lenses, most people will be much happier with a zoom, like the 18-55mm VR. The prime lens lets more light in so you can shoot without a flash more often. But, if you are going to shoot with a good flash like the SB-600, you will be better off with the flexibility of a zoom.These AF lenses will not auto focus on a D40 or D60. They will auto focus on the D50, D70, D80, as well as the higher end pro models."
1,Tales from the Crypt - The Complete First Season,I was disappointed that they were only 6 stories on the tape. I figured the first season would include more for the price. The stories were okay not exceptional. I hope the second season includes more stories.
5,Worth buying for the E.C. history lesson.,"The second disc of season one has a very well done piece on the historTales from the Crypt - The Complete First Seasony of E.C. If I taught high school or college history this is something I would show the class. Very educational and entertaining.It's hard to believe that in today's anything goes world of entertainment that the U.S. government went after and destroyed certain comic book titles in the early 50s. This changed the course of comic book history and led to decades of some really silly comic book covers, characters and stories."
5,Tiny Treasure,"If only the world were actually as wonderful as Sara Midda's charming little paintings and words of garden wisdom. Over the years I've given this book as a gift many times. It's surely a great addition to the bookshelvesof gardeners and anyone who enjoys art, plants, wisdom and whimsy."
1,"""Doesn't work with XP sometimes""","Bad customer service. Not knowledgeable and give differing information. I was told after returning the first as it was ""defective"", that it was my computer and I would need to upgrade for more money. My computer is a brand new top of the line fully updated Dell pentium 4 2.7 gz. Anyway, bad company. Product may be good if you can get it to work."
4,Windows 98 OK but trouble on ME,"This is a good joystick, better than one I had from G*****. Its operation is smooth and precise. But I bought it for my Windows ME machine with a 1.3GHz Pentium 4, USB, and it would not install/work, hanging up. The good news is it installed and worked perfectly on my Windows 98 box, a Celeron 433Mhz CPU, also USB.Saitek responded quickly via email to my problem with the ME machine, with some zipped software and explicit steps to follow. However this still did not work and they have not responded since being notified that their help did not solve the problem.Bottom line is, I'd buy another one for the ME machine if only I could get it to work! For now it is used only on the Windows 98 box, where it really is a ""joy"" stick to use."
5,Best Joystick I'VE ever tried!,"For someone who doesn't use or really usually like Joysticks (me), I really thought this was a great stick! It's comfertable, easy to use, with LOT'S of buttons, meaning you won't have to switch between the Stick and the Keyboard.Excellent joystick, although I don't own it."
3,Not as helpful as i had hoped.,"Although the book was helpful, it would have been more useful to me, had the author given more insights into the thinking behind the various headlines."
3,Dawn...........the dawn of new begining,"This new one from dawn is the start of something that was a long time coming. After en vouge it was only a mtter of time before she would eventually strike out on her own. So now how is the solo cd??? I would say its decent for the first time around. Overall it coudl have been stronger but its good. Songs like set it off, envious, fed up, and get up again will have you playign this over and over. All these songs go from neosoul to slow jams to modern r+b to show that she can do it all and keep you intrested. Any fan of dawn, envouge or lucy pearl should get this becasue its all those styles mixed into her own. The only difference is that its edgier. Overall I would say dont sleep on this.Get it!"
1,lame,it is just smelly soap nothing special do not buy it was not worth it so lame i dont like it at all useless
5,Great Product,"This soap leaves you feeling dry in the shower but once you dry off you feel moisturized and great! You don't feel dry at all, but leaves you with a very clean feeling. I only wish I bought more bars when it was $6.99, which has now gone up to $9.99!!! Yikes, amazon..lower your price!"
1,Broke me out,I had high hopes for this soap so I could move away from using Proactiv. Instead my skin got worse and was often very dry and flakey.
3,Okay all around,"I started using this soap on July 23. I use it two a day, when i shower and before I go to bed.Acne: oily in the T-Zone area with about 1-4 breakout a week. sucks! After using this soaps my current two pimples have dried up and nothing new has come up which it would have done by now without it. And it's VERY drying :( But afer a couple of weeks my face got use to it so its not as drying anymore. My face has always been soft so i cant say this product made my face soft but i still have some of my acne scars which I was hoping it was treat but eh. When i broke out around my period, the soap didnt resolve the issue at all.Skin: I have a bit of my skin issue on my shoulders and hip. It did help b/c it started going away however it didnt ""fix"" it like I had hoped but it did help with my body acne.August 19. Soap for my acne? No. For my eczema? yes. Body acne? Yes"
2,Did nothing for my bacne!,"Decided to use this product for about a week and a half before writing this review-I have a history of bad bacne and wanted to find a product I could use in the shower to help me remove or at least reduce it all. Since this product was reasonably-priced and claimed to be good against bacne, I decided to try it.It did very well to disappoint me.I used this soap with a wash cloth to ensure that I really got in there and opened up my pores to allow the soap to penetrate my skin. I also made sure to wait a minute or two before rinsing off. Did NOT make a dent in the bacne AT ALL.I have come to conclude that this is simply an ordinary bar of soap that smells like mud."
3,This is an interesting product,"It's a little hard to use as my bar is crumbling. Not noticing huge differences to be honest, but still trying it at this point."
5,this item is great,I like it this kind of soap. It make my skin feeling good. Try it you will not loss your money :)
2,Made my skin much worse,"I had little problems on my face before using this soap, small breakout every now and then and a few red spots. (I'm 23,female) I just tried it because I was hoping to make my skincare routine simpler. I used it consistently for three weeks and from day one it made my skin much worse, with a lot of small breakouts, that didn't go away for three weeks, when I stopped using it. I have combination oily skin with tendency to get overly dry. It was fine on my hands, no different than regular soap, worse than Dove. (Dove is the only soap that keeps my hands soft)I later found out about the disadvantages of using any product in the form of soap on your face if you're an acne sufferer, so I recommend you do some research about that if this didn't work for you."
3,Gets job done. Mesh not Solid,"This vest is the mesh version and not the solid version. It is high visibility and gets the job done. Was surprised to find only one pocket -- inside right. Depending on your build, the pocket can end up on the side of your body, making it hard to reach and not very useful."
1,Not worth the time,"I can't remember what I paid to buy this book, but whatever the price; its not worth your time. I threw it away the day I got it. My school textbooks were a 1000 times better to look through. If you no longer have your textbooks; your best bet to start studying for the EIT is to get the Engineer-In-Training Referene Manual and its solution book. From there you can figure out what you are deficient in and rebuild your library."
4,Inexpensive and do a good job,"I paid $17 for these at my LGS. They did the job although the way they are made to be adjustable which makes them feel quite inexpensive borderline cheap. Also, did not fog up one time so very happy about that."
1,Not happy...,"I attempted to order XL black, however I received SM white!!! Not happy, this was supposed to be a holiday gift but I guess that's not going to happen. I better not have to pay to ship it back, especially when it's taking company so long to respond to my request to return..."
3,Good facts but missing the main part,"For a person looking to write a movie treatment for the big screen, the first 20 or so pages outline the requirements very well. But just when you've finished the section on what makes a good movie treatment and are ready to see how all of the requirements tie together, THERE IS NO SAMPLE MOVIE TREATMENT TO REVIEW! NOT ONE! Absolutely bizarre. And yes, treatments vary in how they are written, but how about just one to look at and review? The book moves on to television and gives some sample treatments but they're for a 7 act TV movie which is much different than a 3 act big screen movie. Why is it that a book on how to create treatments omits the very thing that many people buy the book to look at and dissect?"
2,not useful,"If you have already written a screenplay or are a serious screenwriter, there is pretty much no useful information in this book. A lot of the book is filler and more oriented to your screenplay/source material/annals of television story development. Needs more examples of treatments, and more importantly, it needs to make good on its title. This book didn't tell me how to ""write treatments that sell,"" it just explained that treatments exist, and sometimes they're bought."
5,Don't let the title fool you.,"This Cd is one of the best jazz Cd's Ive bought. Tom Scott's cover of "" Love Will Lead You Back"" is one of the best covers of a song I've heard in a very long time. The highly underated Lisa Fischer gives a spectacular vocal performance of "" Way Past Goodbye"". The entire CD is rated A-1 from beginning to end."
2,Disappointed,"Having read many of the Ms Cornwell's books, I found this one most disappointing. I rarely put a book down without completing, but I found this book disjointed and not up to Ms Cornwell's normal standard. I forced myself to read about half way thru hoping there would be an improvement but finally gave up."
1,Page Turner,But only so you can try to figure out what on earth is going on with the three simultaneous stories. The result? Bad. Not worth the time to read. I've been a big fan of Patricia Cornwells to date but was extremely dissapointed with this one.
3,Not much for blood-and-gutsers to chew on,"Although this is another great example of dialogue and a look into human behavior by Cornwell, it was rather a disappointment to my blood-desiring soul. And there was no Kay Scarpetta! Alas, I like character Andy Brazil and was glad at his return and the sexual tension between him and the icy officer Virginia West. I would never tell readers not to read a Cornwell book, but I would definitely recommend her others over this one!"
1,EXTREMELY Disappointed,"I have found it absolutely daunting, to say the least, to finish this book. I have been embarrassed at times for Ms Cornwell, who apparently did not put too much thought into her latest work. The plot, the characters, everything is awful."
1,Disappointing hackneyed effort from gifted writer,"It is hard to believe that Patricia Cornwell didn't lend her name to some no-talent beginning writer for this novel. It has flat characters and boring history. The pets are the smartest characters in this book and we really don't need the insight into their thoughts. Is you love the other Cornwell stories, forget it. Don't bother buying this one."
1,a very poor read,"I simply could not finish this book, and I am a devout fan of Cornwell. It seems after she knocked off Wesley, she had no place to go. We need more of the good old stuff. Back to the morgue please, Kay!"
2,I was disappointed.,The Kay Scarpetta series is one of my all time favorites. I have read about half of this book and I don't believe I will finish it.
3,Don't shoot it down because not Scarpetta,Haven't finished it yet but I believe everyone had hopes of scarpetta and then when they found out they just shot it down. Writers have a stream and sometimes veer off. They have to get that story out before anything else can come. Keep up the good work Patricia.
1,"VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED","I HAVE LOVED ALL OF PATRICIA CORNWALL'S BOOKS. I WILL NEVER BELIEVE THAT SHE ACTUALLY WROTE THIS. BEFORE I BUY ANY BOOK OF HERS AGAIN, I WILL VERY, VERY CAREFULLY READ THE REVIEWS. IF IT IS NOT ABOUT DR SCARPETTA, I WILL NOT BUY IT. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book on clearence for $1. I still think I overpaid. Having read a couple of Cornwell's books, I was shocked to find no gruesome murder or even a good mystery. The book borders on almost sterotyping and a failed attempt in integrating history into the story. One wonders if Cornwell only wrote the book as a way to honor her contract. Borrow this book...if you really want to read it at all."
1,what was she thinking,"Sorry Patricia, this was the third strike. I will give any author two bad books, but not three.This was so bad I didn't even finish it. I will not be reading Cornwell again. To bad, I thought her first four books were SOOO good."
5,review for southern cross,"I managed to obtain a copy of southern cross, though it isn't officially released for another 2 weeks in the US, and even longer in Australia. If you enjoyed Hornet's Nest, I'm sure you will enjoy this also. Well written, and humourous at times, it was lots of fun reading."
3,Actually a three and a half.,"Since this was my first Patricia Cornwell, I had neither any Kay Scarpetta history nor expectations. So I rather enjoyed this one.It has a sense of the Carl Hiaasen/Laurence Shames humor and is an entertaining read. It has a light hearted, ironic and quirky approach. There is also action and movement.Both the good and bad guys have comedic sides and all manage to have their stumbles...the bad guys more so.This novel is what it is, and if not taken too seriously it is a fast, fun, quick read...it's escapism.And for those disappointed not to have a Kay Scarpetta, just think how well refreshed her character will be with this interlude."
1,Worst book ever read,"I bought this book in a secondhand shop in Deventer (Netherlands) thinking it a book by Patricia Cornwall (rather than Cornwell)- what a silly mistake!The characters are not developed, and parts of their stories are hardly relevant. The plot is totally unbelievable: A kid hacks into a web-site and changes the screen saver on a police computers in people's homes ?!?!? Computers in homes that are turned on remotely !?!? Some weird URL created by someone who knows nothing about computers!?!? And the reference at the start of the book (also in the book title) to the strong families in the south never reappears. I'm not a woman, but would a woman really leave hints of another lover to bring to jealousy a previous lover and current colleague? And a cat who makes sure he sees these clues? 1/5 stars - because I was not allowed to enter 0/5"
1,Not worth reading.,This book was very disappointing. Have read Ms. Cornwell's books in the past and found them interesing and the characters likeable.The only character in the book that you could feel any affinity for was Weed. All the rest of the characters were whiny and irritating.Would not recommend this book at all.
1,Extremely bad writing,"It would be disappointing to think that Cornwell is incapable of writing anything other than the Scarpetta series but this book and Hornet's Nest do nothing to convince me otherwise. A complete mess, uneven and devoid of plot, purpose, humor, reason, likeable characters, or much of anything good. Come on, Patricia, we deserve better!"
1,A disappointment from Cornwell.,"If this were the first book I had read by this author, I would never buy her books again. We have a sick attempt at humor by using character names such as But Fluck and animals talking to and for their owners and managing their lives. I found very little mystery or anything that really had to do with Police work. Count me out on Cornwell in the future."
1,It's BAD!,"I like Patricia Cornwall books - I like them very much. BUT this book is BAD! (I suspect/hope that she didn't actually write it!).The plots partially revolves around a computer virus and EVERYTHING that's written about the virus is complete JUNK - it makes me wonder if she did any research for this book, or just made it all up on the spot. And it also makes me worried that the topics that I don't know so much about are also very badly researched! Let's hope that the next Kay Scarpetta book is back to the old Patricia Cornwall - if not, she's lost a fan here!"
2,Southern Cross: A large one to bare,"I guess I'm too much of a Kay Scarpetta fan to feel anything for these characters. While Chief Hammer is tough, she can't hold a candle to Kay on the strong, savvy, emotional scale. I did thoroughly enjoy the 'Dispatcher vs. Police Officer' entanglement, in fact, burst out laughing upon reading it. The characters just didn't pull me in; they seemed flat emotionally with the exception of Weed. Which brings up another remark: names like Smoke, Weed, Butt Fluck???? PC if you're reading this....BRING BACK KAY!!!!"
1,I only gave it one star because there were no lower options!,"I was really disappointed by Southern Cross. I've always enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta novels, but this didn't even seem like it was written by the same author. The pet perspectives were annoying, as was the childish relationship between West and Brazil. And the plot was weak, too. I'd say to save your money on this one!"
1,Very disappointing for a Patricia Cornwell fan,"Looks like this one was just rushed out the door - without much thought and without a lot of editing. Quite the opposite of Ms. Cornwell's previous work. . . after several starts and forcing myself to continue reading (after all, I did go for the hardcover edition!) I finally gave up at page 110; and I have no interest in how it turns out. Next time I'll read the reviews first!"
1,One of the worst books I have ever read.,Patricia should stick with the Scarpetta series. This book is awful!! I am from the South and consider this book to be an insult to all Southerners. The book has no apparent plot and most of the time makes very little sense to the reader. I did not finish it due to lack of interest.
3,Dr. Scarpetta was greatly missed,"While the story was interesting, it just was not up to Patricia Cornwell usual standard. The story line simply did not come together as well as some of her other books."
3,"Not bad, but not up to par with Kay Scarpetta",This did not seem like a Patricia Cornwell novel. I love her Kay Scaretta books because they are so technical and true to life.Southern Cross was a little too imaginiative and the story line had too many twists and turns to make much sense. There were too many characters and not enough depth.I love Patricia Cornwell and I have faith in her writing abilities. But I think she should either stick to writing about Kay or develop new characters a little more and make the plots a little more realistic.Suggestion to readers: check the book out from the library. Don't pay good money for it.
2,very dissappointing,I am an avid reader of all of PAtricia Cornwells books. I especially loved Hornets Nest.That is why I cannot understand this book at all. The characters are simply unbelievable and uninteresting.The prose at times is very bad and indeed sometimes the sentences really dont make much sense.The spelling is bad thr out the book or maybe they were all misprints.Please bring back Scarpetta fast !!!!
1,worst book i've read,"I think Patricia Cornwell should go back to her regular characters. This book is a disaster. Very, very disappointed"
1,Worst Cornwell ever...,"This was not only the worst Patricia Cornwell book I ever read, it was the worst book I ever read, PERIOD! It was so bad it took me about nine months and three tries to get through. Don't buy the excuse that this was meant to be satire and definitely don't buy this book!"
1,Lousy,"I have been a fan of Patricia's writing for many years. This one was a big miss. It appeared as if it was thrown together at the last minute. I like the characters Hammer, West and Brazil but I didn't see the point in some of the others. Butner Fluck and Smudge? What did they have to do with anything? If these two were her effort to describe people in the South; I hope she was kidding. The dispatcher getting arrested was out of nowhere. The cast of characters never came together. I wouldn't waste your time or money on this one."
1,This is not Cornwell's typical book and I am a fan.,Very choppy and not a consistent smooth plot formation. Not typical of Cornwell and the Scarpetta books. She needs to stay away from the cop stories and stick to forensics and Scarpetta.
2,Please bring Kay Scarpetta back!!!!,The book is so so. It pales in comparison to her other books. Bring back Kay Scarpetta and her crew.
1,Terrible,"I'm an IT person and I laughed throughout this entire book, that's how silly it is. This is completely dumb. The entire plot is dumb."
4,Great Pace!,"The story about how a female Chief of Police in Richmond deals with a new crime epidemic was very gripping. The humor was well-timed and appropriate and the concept was timely. Some of the names used for characters were a little sophmoric, but it is an enjoyable read on the whole."
3,was an ok. book,"i was disappointed with Hornet's Nest. but after I got used to the charetors and gave Southern Cross a chance. i think i would read another Hammer, West, and Brazil novel. although i miss Dr.Kay and Lucy very much. I think i could get used to two different styles."
1,very disappointed,I've been an avid Cornwell fan.I will not however purchase another unless Kay Scarpetta is back. The Scarpetta books flow and are almost impossible to put down. Once into Southern Cross it was almost impossible to pick up.
2,'A Cornwell Disappointment',"I am a dedicated Cornwell fan, but this was her worst yet! At times the story was hard to follow, too many words watsed on irrelevant descriptions and definitely not a page-turner! None of Corwell's usual style and humor comes forth in this book. Corwell should stick to what she does best: the continuing saga of Kay Scarpetta and leave well enough alone!"
1,This cast of characters fail,Based on the book this will be the last of P. Cornwells cast of police characters. This book went nowhere . A waste of time and money .
1,very bad - this was my last P.Cornwell hardcover,"I think I have bought nearly all Scarpetta novels by Patricia Cornwell in hardcover, and mostly enjoyed them (though the bad characters have a tendency to get more improbably from volume to volume, soon we will see green monsters from Mars as Cornwell's serial killers).Southern cross is just pulp which should have never moved beyond any editors desk, but landed in the garbage bin where it belongs. I will never again buy a hardcover by Cornwell.Just because an author has made his/her name publishers and authors often seem to think they can get away with anything and make money out of the established name. I hope this strategy backfires so bdaly in this case that others will also learn from it.Please excuse my limited English, I am not a native speaker of it."
1,Not a humorist,"Ms. Cornwell should stick to what she does best; thrillers. I trudged through to the end of this book so I could feel credible about writing a review. It was slow-paced and generally dull. The attempts at comedy were trite and forced; ""Butner Fluck III?"" Puleeeeeze! I've read and enjoyed all Ms Cornwell's other works, including ""Hornets' Nest"", but this was definitely not worth my money, even in paperback."
5,A Great Tool for A Beginning Gymnasts Parents!!!,"This book has a lot of useful information for the beginning parent who wants to learn more about the sport. It covered a variety of aspects, from finding the right gymnastics club to the mental and physical preparation of a competing gymnast."
3,Too outdated,Some good info but much has changed since then I would only recommend it for a real new gymnast. Okay.
5,An Intense Look at Self,"Divine Right's trip is an excellent novel about a small-town kid turned hippy who leaves town in his VW bus to discover the world. It is an accurate fictional portrayal of Kentucky and Appalachian life, and contains several take home lines-- my favorites being clever lines of rage against big coal.Divine Right finds himself lost but is determined to find himself- which he eventually does. A great novel for those of us who know that there is always more to life than we have yet seen.This novel also introduced me to one of Gurney Norman's other works, Kinfolks. It's also a great read."
3,"Good, but...","The recipes sound good, but lack detail. The book often does not indicate the size of the can or package. Recipes do not indicate the number of servings each recipe makes."
1,"boring ,banal ,blaaaaaaahhhhhhhh ! ! ! ! !","I'm not too much of a Star Wars fan , but I do know the plot , characters , ect. I haven't really read any other of the Star Wars comics , but I do know good work when I see it........ AND THIS IS FAR FROM IT ! The colors were murky , and tasteless. The plot........... well, I could have written something better . World Devastators?! A resurected Emperor Palpatine ?! WAY TOO TYPICAL ! @_@ - blahhh ! The people that made this probably wanted to create a brand new universe in the Star Wars world but they failed MISERABLY . ...... SEE KIDS , THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU AREN'T ORIGINAL !"
2,This story was a waste of potential,Great ideas. But the final product is a true waste of potential. The idea of Luke going to the Dark side was well done and very believable considering it is his fate anyway. But this book has MANY flaws in the story. Too many for me to even list.
1,I personally hate this book for more than one reason!!!,"I love reading, specially Star Wars. Now first of all, I know you state that it's a comic, but please, Say it in big print! This Is A COMIC BOOK! Second, the illistration looks nothing at all like the characters. Finally, I think some of the things said are not what the characters would say. Sorry but this book is not what I would say interesting. The story line would be great for a real book, some one should try writing one on this subject. If you're like me and hate comics don't get this book!"
5,great book,"well written, good and believable story, hard to like the hero but you will respect him even if you do not agree with him. fun and interesting read .all of ben pastor's books are well worth reading"
5,Hilarious as ever!,"My husband and I are big fans of _Corner Gas_, and since our cable stations have quit showing it, we've been progressively buying the DVDs from Amazon. Amazon and its sellers have proven the best way for us to purchase Canadian television in the southern US."
5,A Staple in My Kitchen,"I was very happy to see Amazon sold Goya seasoning in the bulk. I use it alot and it keeps me from running to the super market all the time.The packets are fresh and they keep well, also the price is a plus as I save money on them. You can not find this in most super markets where I live. Thank you Amazon!"
4,The Sender,Video Quality is Fine.Thoroughly enjoyed movie.70 out of 100 for a Madsen movie plot and action.Well worth 8 dollars
3,A bit pricey,"I bought this batter to replace one in my remote control. I couldn't tell the quality of the batter because when I put it in the controller didn't work. I cannot blame the battery because the controller might be broken, but either way its a lot more expensive then a AA"
1,Very Unapealing,This book seems to okay irrational behavior and embracessomeone to not face their mistakes or upsets but instead have somekooky way to try to make everything seem fine. You can not go back and undo things that you have done to people who have died and by going through with that wedding Hannah really shows no responsibility for the situation she created. It makes me ponder whether the author just had a bad idea for a book or if indeed she shares this lack of responsibility for situations. I advise people not read this for it instills the wrong values in people and leads people to believe that they can just make everything ok again.
5,I Hunger For More Janis Ian,"Hunger is an exceptional album. Janis takes hold of you and doesn't let you go till the last chord fades on the last song.I then reach over and hit the play button and take the ride again. Be sure to listen to my favorite track ""Welcome To Acousticville"". It's just Janis and her acoustic guitar playing live, some of the best blues I've ever heard. This cut is how you would hear Janis in concert,just her and her guitar.That's all she really needs.I highly recomend Hunger. Janis Ian is remembered for ""At Seventeen"". If you haven't heard anything from her since then, you are missing a lot of great music."
2,europop,"LUTRICIA MCNEAL whatcha been doing **whatcha been doing, american-born, denmark-resident lutricia mcneal's second album, is straightforward euro-pop. filled with beats, lyrics and arrangements that you would expect of any--save, perhaps, melanie c.'s--spice girl solo project. though she does get more soulful on the title track and tackles a dance track on ""fly away"", you'd do better to go ahead and get those spice girl solo projects or, better yet, any lisa stansfield album. it's quite possible that mcneal is a gifted singer but, on this project at least, she's too mired down in mediocre songwriting and production to make that determination."
5,PA-6f speakers,"Fantastic set of speakers. From crisp highs to perfect midrange and lows. Not super bassy but well balancedBuild quality: top notch, Nice and heavy, around 40lbs eaNice gold plated 5way terminals, although bi-amped and bi-wirable, it isn't an issueAfter breaking these in, they truly do sound amazing, nice and loud for music and great as fronts for 5.1 movies. I auditioned these vs Polk, BIC acoustech, infinity 363 and jbl es80. And the choice was between these and the infinity, and I chose these based on color of the woodgrain finishes.As far as bass goes, these aren't 8-12""speakers so if you want that booming big bass look for a bigger speaker, I use these crossovered at 40 Hz and sub to pick up everything else, and it sounds awesome"
4,Lovely religious Christmas piano music,"I purchased this cd because I had heard ""Joy to the World"" on a compilation CD of various artists. I was otherwise unfamiliar with Jim Brickman. I liked his piano style on this song with some light jazzy overtones. ""The Gift"" is a mostly instrumental CD. I would have liked a bit more variety in his piano playing from song to song. I enjoyed the largely traditional treatment of my favorite Christmas carols. I recommend this CD to anyone looking for religious Christmas piano music. The music is both spiritual and soothing."
3,Good Christmas music but not the vocals,I'm not fond of the vocals on any of Jim Brickman's work and this is no exception. His playing is lovely as always but I wish he'd stick to instrumentals and not have vocalists on his albums. They always seem to ruin the mood.
5,Ever American Should Read This Book,P.J. Takes all the boring basic theory of Econoics and compares how that theory fares in the real world. He picks best and worst examples in many measures from around the world. He does this while making you bust a gut laughing. If learing had been this fun when we were in school we all be Ph. D's by now. Everyone ought to read this book before they vote again. Buy two copies I guarantee you want to give this book to someone. P.J is the best satarist writing today.
2,Eat the Rich: NOT a Treatise on Economics,"P.J. O'Rourke is a very funny man. P.J. O'Rourke is a very well traveled man. This book shows both of those things, it does not teach you about economics.If you want a book to teach you about a very few group of countries from a VERY distorted very of the country, this is most definitely the book for you. However, if you are looking for a book that this one seems like, which is a book on economics, this should be skipped.O'Rourke has a strong conservative bias, and fails to realize the American system of individuality may not work around the world the same way it does here.Overall, I would skip this book."
2,"Overall insulting, teaches basic economics","If you would like to read basic economics explained to you in layman terms, you'll appreciate this book.If you like clever and witty humor, you won't. This book mainly takes cheap shots at obvious targets and somehow expects them to be funny."
3,Entertaining Fluff,"If you want to read a very witty, entertaining book and see a very American-centric view of the world, by all means buy this book. If you want a balanced and properly researched analysis, don't. There are far too many conclusions in here that are supported by the mere shreds of anecdotal evidence gleaned from visting a few hotels in foreign countries. A good laugh, though!"
2,"Started off alright, went downhill fast toward the end.","A muddled, myopic, and relatively juvenile interpretation of economics. Eat the Rich presents a simplistic and rosy picture of Libertarian and laissez-faire ideas without delving into even the most obvious and well documented negatives of those systems (ie, negative externalities). The somewhat gushing praise of free markets and Friedman-esque oversimplification of Adam Smith presented by O'Rourke seem all the more silly in the light of our recent economic crisis. Read How Markets Fail for a much more interesting, intelligent, and in-depth analysis of unfettered free markets."
3,kinda funny but you can't believe a word,"I liked it, largely. I do most of my reading on my long train commute and it was funny enough to make me laugh embarrassingly in public. But the chapter on Hong Kong really spoiled everything. It was so flippant and inaccurate that I ceased to believe anything I'd read in previous chapters. Can I just point out that we Brits only leased Hong Kong for 99 years and that if we hadn't handed it back, we'd be at war with China now. So was it OK, then? It was not 'a shamful moment' - it was honouring an agreement (not that we had any choice, which is the point)."
2,Capitalism is not economics,"This is NOT an introduction to economics; it is an introduction to capitalist ideology. They are not the same! It is mildly amusing in parts, but if you don't share the author's belief in the benelevolence of the free market you may find it irritatingly dogmatic."
1,Modern adaptations with SYNTHESIZER!,yUK! It doesn't take a musician to play the fartkeyboard any idiot can do it and every idiot does. When this is left out of the description in the advertisement it can only be called a cowardly rip off!
1,SOPORIFIC TALENT,"If Candida were given parchment and pen, she would have at least produced a book of poetry to delight the lowest senses, this book by Ms. McClanahan, on the other hand, appeals to no senses at all. What lack of utter passion, and utter lack of intellectual activity these poems have! To the lions, to the lions of obscurity these poems must be banished. Not recommended at all."
2,Not for Dummies or those who need to learn about verbs,"This book will not teach you about verbs and conjugations. It assumes that you already know and undersstand how grammar works and just jumbs into review. The writer does not know how to explain the subject and just assumes that someone else has done the hard work of teaching you the subject matter. I knew that I had wasted my money when reading the Introduction the author states that she assumes that you already have a background in Spanish, and have learned all of the verb tenses, then she goes on to recommend Spanish for Dummies if you are a rank beginner. Spanish for Dummies is also a worthless teaching guide, save your money and avoid the whole Spanish for Dummies series. The editors need to find authors who know how to do the hard work of explaining how a language works."
1,Extremely biased!,Refers to theorists and their readers as loons. The amount of bigotry is astounding. I am sorry to have bought a book written by such an obtuse character.
4,Batman Multipack,"Grandkids have a great time playing with this set, and it included a lot for the price. I would definitely buy for them again."
1,5 Stars? Forget it...,"I must have missed something in this book that people would give it 5 stars. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who did not like the book. I found the story and characters inspid. The bird, Lord Nightingale, detracted from what might have been a good story. I just don't know. This book was quite inferior compared to Ms. Lansdowne's previous works."
1,Too Scary For Some Kids!,"My third grader checked this out of the library, thinking that it would be a kid's book about a horse mystery. WRONG! This book had her scared for a week! She took it back, and checked out Little House In The Big Woods. Better choice! Not a book for a young reader, even if she is a horse lover!"
1,Why Vanity Publishing Should Be Illegal,"I don't know what Larrabee's problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce. This ""author"" is not the brightest crayon in the box. Maybe the aliens forget to remove his anal probe."
2,an 'Ohgr Fan' metal sign?,Why would thee? WHY WOULD THOU??? Overpriced Ennui-Object. Should be given away to KIDS under 12 -only !
4,A Must For Fans of Science Thrillers,"Leonard Crane's Ninth Day of Creation is an excellent science thriller that has unfortunately been a bit overlooked. It is not nearly as well known as it should be, this is truly an excellent book. Indeed, this is the best book of it's type that I have read in a long time not written by a certain M. Crichton. This book deals with complex science issues (biological weapons, search for the cure for AIDS, protein folding, etc.) that will appeal to readers who like a science slant to their novels. However, it also has a thriller and suspense aspect. Anyone should like this book.Reccommended for Crichton fans!"
2,Very expensive for the information offered.,"I found this book to be very expensive and out of date. It appears not to have been updated in some time. The peace in Guatemala is not even mentioned. A much better book for the content,information,and price would be the People's Guide to Mexico."
3,Inspirational,"This book is a series of questions and concerns written to Baba Hari Dass. His answers are written with such deep understanding, compasion and love. A wonderful gift for anyone on a spiritual path."
3,Roy Montgomery - '324 E. 13th Street #7' (Drunken Fish),"This sort of musical genre,singer/songwriter has never exactly been my cup of tea,although I'll have to give credit to New Zealand's native Roy Montgomery.The man CAN write and play good songs.Twenty tunes compiled here with a duration of 71:19.'324...' features Montgomery's six(6)singles from l985-99.So,I guess that would mean that three songs come pressed on each single.In fact,I think I remember getting a vinyl 45 of his several years ago.Tunes I thought that sort of stood out were the surf-rockin' like ""Trial By Separation"",the acoustic guitar gem ""Cousin Song"",""Just Melancholy"" and ""Strange Attractor"".Didn't seem to hear too much of a space rock element here,more like maybe psychedelic pop.Good,just the same."
4,Powerful and hypnotic,"Sublime is a chypre-floral with an oakmoss developing into jasmine and citrus. The dry-down is elegant. When you spray it intially, however, it is VERY strong. Two sprays in the bath scented the entire house. The flask is gorgeous, like a lotus bud."
5,~Like water cascading over a rocky cliff~,I don't know why but beautiful music always reminds me of something and this CD reminds me of waterfalls splashing over rocks amongst misty meadows. It's got to be the piano and the way the melodies ebb and flow that just feels like the magic and serenity of rushing water. The music just seems to carry you away in a lovely enchanting dream.
4,Great small laptop bag- watch the zipper tags though,"I love this bag. It was perfect for my ""baby"" laptop. the zippers zip great. one of the zipper pulls fell off after about two weeks but was easily replaced. the other one stayed strong for years. I've had this bag now 5 or 6 years and it still looks great. I use it on a daily basis and it has now wear and tear marks which is a total bonus for me."
3,better than *Sugars That Heal*,"This is a book on plant and fungus based, herbal medicine masquerading as a book on sugars. Although many useful plant and fungal extracts are covered, ingestion of the 8 essential sugars as isolated sugars is barely touched on.This is sort of like writing a book on ""the amazing properties of carbon"" and spending all of the subject matter on diamonds (complex form of carbon).If there is a book with chapters like ""Eating 2 grams a day of pure fucose (or galactose, or mannose etc.) does this!"" please someone let me know!"
5,Glyconutrient Link,Miracle Sugars by R Elkins. Answers many questions I had. I found it quite informative and easy to read and understand.
1,Incorrect entry,"I ordered this item, and received Revlon tweezers that were not the ones pictured (different slant tip ones). I'm very disappointed. Revlon has apparenty changed the grip and discontinued the older model pictured, which is actually a better design. The new tweezers that are stocked and shipped differ in the shape (no taper) and tip (less grip)."
2,typical nu-metal......crap,"this is like the default average hard rock CD. there is NOTHING special or different about this band. every song has the same guitar pattern that everyone uses which gets just irritating after awhile cos that alone shows where the music scene is going. and at first, you may think the vocals are good, but they really aren't. in fact, ""told you so"" has a bit of the [big] man rapping in it. the lyrics [are no good]. it's just about self-pity. like we've never heard that before. (korn, adema, staind) i keep wondering how bands like this get signed but then again this is the same label that signed creed so maybe it isn't all that surprising."
3,Good Debut..But predictable,"Good debut, but nothing will stick in your mind until after a few listens. Sounds a lot like everything else out there, but the production is fresh, and they do have potential. Hopefully this wont be their only album, and they wont be affraid to try expanding their horizons on the next release. But for those who want a fresh sounding, predictable yet good record, and already have the best bands like Scrape and Nonpoint, this is'nt a bad CD to crank out.."
2,Uncreativity,"Drowning Pool, to me, are probably known as a ""wanna be heavy metal band"". Other bands like Slipknot, Fear Factory, Korn, and Slayer have already made the difference in metal and bands like Soil, Static-X, and Drowning Pool are uncreative and unrealistic. Their first song to hit MTV is ""Bodies"". Definitly annoying (For those are preparing to loose weight and feel like doing jumping-jacks, then this song is for you). I'm sorry to say for all metal-head fans but Drowning Pool is not something new. So if I were you, I would go dig somewhere else. This album isn't worth it"
1,where is metal headed?,"i bought this cd cuz i heard Bodies (plus it was only 9 bucks, so i figured what the heck!) and i started out with few expectations. the few i had were smashed into little tiny pieces. these guys lack texture and complexity. lyric content is no bargain either. (*sigh*) i guess this is where metal is headed. its all poppish, like Linkin Park and Adema, etc... im a big fan of bands like Metallica, Tool, Alice Cooper, etc... bands that defined metal. not that every band has to make a landmark for themselves right away but these guys just dont have it. screaming does not account for lack of guitar experiece. sorry guys, but get some guitar (and voice) lessons or get a new band."
3,Not too bad...,"I expected more from Drowning Pool's latest effort, ""Sinner"". After hearing the pop moshpit hit ""Bodies"", I decided to pick this album up. It was a mere ..., so it wouldn't be a big loss.While the album is good overall, ""Bodies"" is the standout track IMO. It is just more intense than all of the other songs. The rest of the CD is the generic nu-metal we have been hearing for a while now."
1,Nu-Metal sinks to Nu-Lows,"This sound has been done to death in the past 5 years and the fact that MTV and radio continue to shove it down our throats is just horrible when there are so many more deserving bands with diverse sounds. This band has some of the most immature and cliche lyrics I've ever heard, usually only writing 20 lines a song and repeating the chorus over and over!! If this is the future of metal, that bands just copy Korn with a touch of lite-grunge rock thrown in, then it it should be no surprise when metal is seen as a joke again, and thats sad as I love metal and its Korn klone bands like this that give the whole scene a bad name!! Avoid this album and band at all costs."
1,Another horrible nu-metal band!!!,"Just when you think there will be no more un-original nu-metal garbage coming out, along comes an album as shallow as this. A friend of mine gave me this cd, she said she didn't want it as she hated all but maybe 2 songs on it. I gave it a fair listen as I'm into many different types of music, but I can find nothing good or original about this band!! The riffs are very simple and repetitive, and the lyrics are about the dumbest I've ever heard, and I've heard thousand of bands!!! I was familiar with the ""Bodies"" single and hated that, and thought maybe there would be better songs to be found on the album, but they are all boring and repetitive just like that song, play a few simple riffs and repeat about ten lines in each song is the theme of the album. Go listen to better bands like Dillinger Escape Plan and Dream Theater for some truly innovative music!!! Avoid Staind also!!!"
2,Try Harder,"If you like mindless metal, maybe you'll dig this CD. One of the biggest problems heavy bands have these days are nonsense lyrics. Too many bands out right now have nothing to say lyrically, and Drowning Pool is right up there. Come on people, ""1, nothing wrong with me, 2, nothing wrong with me..."" - what is that stuff? This album is unoriginal and boring. The only redeeming qualities are some interesting guitar parts."
4,GOOD NU METAL ALBUM,"Face it.The singer is nothing outta this world(well,now he is).The recording is not top notch.The very track that led me to buy the album,Bodies,turned out not to be as good as it seemed on MTV.But it's the rest of the songs that captured my soul.Opposed to everyboby's opinion,I don't find Korn resemblances here but an original(as far as the genre limitations allows) band with a nice,tight,powerful and emotionally driving,aggresive nu metal sound.All in all,a VERY good record worth the price."
4,Zombie Campout Review,"Just like all the rest, I was hesitant at first. If history has taught me anything, it's not to watch zombie movies anymore. However, when I was told about this movie, the curiosity got the better of me, and I watched it. I was glad I did. It was your typical zombie movie, with strange effects and humor. Fun movie to watch at a sleepover."
3,It's a campy fun zombie movie,"I laughed my ass off during this movie. It's up there with Necropolis Awakened in that it's a low budget zombie movie, but better in that the special effects are more meritable...except for the occasional prosthetic arm that flies out every once in a while. The one liners and little humorous bits throughout it are what really make this a fun movie to watch. The cover makes it look like it's a classic '70's T&A horror flic...but there is no T&A in it at all...which was a little disappointing. But still, I had fun watching this movie. : )"
2,Only one good song here,"And that would be the title track, which is very catchy and one of their best songs. It plays during the end credits; as for the rest of the album it mostly filler and hardly deserving to be called Belle & Sebastian. I hate that the opening credit music isn't included on this cd. They also should have had the exchange between Vi and Mr. Scott on here (yeah, you know which one I'm talking about...)"
2,Really too essential,"I really like how this book is organised. Alphabetically, with 2-pages sections scattered throughout and dedicated to a particular themes (transformation, the living sky, mother earth, etc.). The terms concern mostly the different Indian nations and concepts related to believes, with particular regard to stories and characters. There are also so many nice, colour pictures.Such a shame that the material presented in here is so shallow.Stories and characters are related in such an essential way that they end up looking all the same and it's very difficult to remember anything about any story.Nations are presented just in terms of geographical origin, very few and short historical events, extremely essential information about their life today.In fact, everything is so essential, that the book can hardly be used even as reference. Really such a pity."
5,Wrangler Capris,"I am very happy with my purchase of these stretch capris. It is very hard for me to buy clothes over the internet, but I am pleased with this purchase."
2,I can't tell that it helped,"There are still fleas all over the seven dogs even about a week after dipping and I did it a little strong. However, maybe I have some invicible crop of fleas as nothing seems to work, even what has worked in the passed like frontline plus and advantage. Cap star is the only thing that seems to work, as it makes the dogs start raining dead fleas, but it's too expensive to use for long. I have in mind a few other things to try. Next I'm going try comfortis, which I have been reluctant to do because of the long list of possible side effects, but I have to find something that will work."
3,Works good on fleas not so good on ticks,I like the product for flea's but a week after dipping my dogs. They where infested with ticks. We used the method of spraying it on the dogs coat and that seemed to work better for the ticks. Would use again if I have a flea problem. Good priced item.
4,Good Flow and Mix,"I just bought this album recently and to be honest the first time I heard I was a bit shocked and didn't really know what to think about it. After not ""track-skimming"" more or less I began to listen to it more with an open mind and I began to get into it. No not all the tracks are as good as the originals but why I gave it 4 stars is because 4 or 5 tracks that blew me away. Remember, Fibonacci Sequence, Flaming June, Sunblind and Blue Skies. THIS TRACKS ARE AMAZING... and they don't go into that crappy trance type, they take you somewhere else and put a attitude on things."
4,A Tough EP,"This was definitely a nice surprise. I have never heard of the Bedroom Wizard but bought it anyway based on its label (that would be GoodVibe) and it's price (cheap).The Wiz's tracks are well-produced, layered, and tough. His collaborating emcees completely compliment the Wiz's style... equally aggressive and sharp tongued. If there is one word I would use to describe this short and sweet composition, it would be ""DRAMATIC"".Although most of it is pretty straight forward (hip hop braggadocia) with a couple of exceptions, what it ""lacks"" (for the lack of a better word) in depth, it makes up in skill.I await the LP."
3,"Unit works well, but maintenance and parts a drag","The unit works well eliminating dust and odor. Most of my friends who have this machine have the same complaint that I do - Maintenance and new parts. They tell you that you never need to buy another filter. This is true, but the lamp ($17) always needs replacing (this is the 3rd one in 18 months) and friends of mine have complained that they have needed to replace the plate many times. Since you cannot buy parts at your local store, you need to get them online and wait while your machine is out of commission. You need to clean the machine at least once a month. It is not like other machines that just snap open. You need to unscrew the back panel, front panel and inside panel. It is amazing how dusty the inside gets! The filters are easy to wash down. Like anything else, when it is working it is great."
2,Not good for large dogs,"We bought this about a week ago, and it seemed to work for a few days but apparently my dog is too smart for it. He found where the wire went into the ground and dug it up. He pulled the entire wire out of the ground!!!! This may work well for small dogs, but apparently the shock didn't bother my 75 lb lab that much if he was able to be close enough to dig up the wire.I am giving this 2 stars instead of one because it may work well for a smaller dog that is more bothered by the shock."
1,Worked for a little while,"Innotek just doesn't cut it. The collar worked for about 3 months but after a battery change it doesn't affect the dogs anymore. I'm getting current through the collar, I can hear the signal, but the dogs don't show any response. Heck, they lay right down on the wire! Since its beyond warranty I'm out $$$ and looking for another solution."
2,Buyer Beware,"This system worked great at first. However, once the batteries died in both of our dogs' collars and we had to replace them, neither collar would work at all. Calling Innotek was useless. These collars lasted just over a year and since they were out of warranty the only thing they could do was give us a credit towards the purchase of new collars. They did not care that their product was defective. We will never buy another Innotek product again knowing that once the warranty has expired so does the usefulness of their product."
1,junk product and service,"Buyer Beware. I purchased this system, laid it out in my garden and turned it on. then I tried the collar on my own arm. It did shock me, but immediate the system went down and would not come back on.I called customer service and after lots of questions 20 minutes later I was told I needed a new transformer. They then had me email me receipt for purchase which I did. But BECAUSE I PURCHASED IT ON AMAZON ""WE CAN NOT VERIFY YOUR VENDOR"" AND THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE IT. THEN AMAZINGLY I WHEN I SAID OK I'LL JUST PAY FOR A REPLACEMENT, THEY SAID NO THAT WAS AGAINST THEIR POLICY!!! SO I AM STUCK C NO WAY TO FIX THE PROBLEM!!"
5,THE Standard Model,"This is by and large the best popular book I have ever read as far as explaining the standard model goes. Everything is clear and concise, and there's even a wonderful table explaining all about the Standard Model. I only wish it had explained a little more about spin; I still don't get that one. But buy it! You will not be sorry!"
1,Boring,"I've read several popular physics books, and I think this one was the worst. I hoped the followup ""Supersymmetry"" would be better. I think I made it through the first chapter before putting it down for good. Try Elegant Universe or one of Stephen Hawking's books instead."
1,100% DISSATISFIED!,"I will never purchase anything from this company again. I am not really ""educated"" on cameras and was looking for a film camera for my mother; I bought this camera not realizing how out-dated it was and the product information certainly didn't tell you that the camera is so out-dated that you can't even buy batteries to fit the camera! I was very unsatisfied and returned it only to be charged a 20% restocking fee. How outrageous! 100% dissatisfied! NEVER AGAIN! I had to give it one star to send the review but this is really a ZERO star review!"
4,Good story,"I found this book to be very entertaining. After reading the first book out of sequence, I decided to try to collect the entire series. I'm still working my way through the series."
3,More like 3 and a Half,"The film has spice and color, even though the story line is formula, except the part about the girlfriend, sort of a funny twist there. It is about a Harlem Salsa Singer trying to crossover, but his fate is a bit different than Selena. He ends up rising very quickly and crashing even more quickly. I really really liked the color and the shots of East Harlem. I even liked more the music. It had a liveliness that made the film come alive more. I thought Ruben Blades did a great job in acting his part, staying right with his character. His film presence is very magnetic. I also like Elizabeth Pena, although she doesn't have a whole lotta of spark in this film. It was a nice film and I suggest it and recommend it.Lisa Nary"
5,If you can find it under $100 buy it...,"This book is a comprehensive look at the history of European embroidery. It has some amazing photos and listing of stiches used. Terrific for the embroidery geek on your shopping list. But be warned, it is rare to find this book for less than $200-300. So, grab it when you can, as it is no longer being publishd."
3,Works ok...,"This stylus does what it is supposed to, but is not as responsive as I would like and the tip just is way too soft. I could see it breaking just because you really have to drag it across the screen to get it to work."
1,DON'T WORRY ITZ COMING!!!!,"Yeah "" right wing extremism"" in Europe oh no, Maybe the european race is finally waking up!!. To people reading this garbage propaganda and want to know why Western nations must be ""tolerant"" and ""obedient"" to the mulitcultarization and third world intergration to our civlization read "" the culture of critique""."
2,Witness Katrina,It was quite informative but the language on part of it caused me not to show the class. Also the inappropriate drinking and bar scene I found disturbing. Therefore not useful for a classroom setting.
1,Why is this so expensive?,"Seriously? It's a book for God's sake. It shouldn't cost upwards of $200. If someone could shed some light as to why it's so expensive, or point me in a direction where I can find it at a more reasonable price, I would greatly appreciate it."
4,An exceptional lens,"Sharp as a tack wide open. The manual focus ring operates smooth as silk, unlike some other Nikon lenses. My copy backfocuses ever so slightly on test charts, but in the real world focuses flawlessly. Quality built in Japan. This is a must have for a DSLR.I agree that Nikon should make a 35mm f/1.4D, or better yet a 28mm f/1.4D. The f/1.8 (the 50mm) and f/2.0 (the 35mm) just barely squeek by as usable for available light street photography at night, unless you go to an ISO over 400 (which on my D80 is at the limit of usable at night in terms of noise)."
5,Very Good Lens,"I spent 30 years as a pro shooter, using Nikons. Since I retired, I only use my cameras to photograph my child. My F3s and fast AI lenses are stored away, and I now use a D70s and a new D300. I found the zooms a bit soft, bought a 60mm D lens, loved it, and got the 35 f2D. Very sharp, fast enough (my AI was a 1.4 but that was a working lens, this one is for fun) for my current needs, good color, good edges, seems to do the job for a reasonable amount of money."
3,good stuff,"I picked up this cd to review at my college radio station and I was instantly reminded of Pink Floyd and ""Bends""-Era Radiohead. This is a great cd to zone out to in your basement or whatever. worth a listen."
3,Missing Romance,"The Seventh Sister is a decent ensemble book. Maggie hooks up with Captain Bixworth when her brother is called out of town on buisness and calls in a marker from one of his fellow soldiers to keep an eye on his 'bug hunting' sister. The characters in the story are interesting enough but unfortunatly the plot itself is scanty. Also the lovers, Maggie and the Captain, have almost no sexual chemistry between them. It's not that I expect or neccisarily want steamy scenes in my Regencys', it's just that I want to know that the characters could get steamy off the page somewhere."
3,At times very technical.,A good read for understanding the great implications of globalization. Definately a Textbook! Good for economics and popular culture courses.
2,Very Disappointed!,"I bought one of these colorful dog bowls several months ago for my 35lb dog. It's quite pretty, lovely bright colors, but it doesn't last like other ceramic dog bowls I have purchased in the past from other companies.The paint has chipped off around the entire edge. I worry that my dog may have ingested some of these paint chips. It is really a shame too, because these dishes have good weight and are very pretty. I will never buy another one nor do I recommend these bowls for anyone who intends to use them to feed their pets from."
3,A series of short spy stories linked together,"I read this on a friends recommendation, we both like SciFi.Had it not been for my friends recommendation, and that the author has some other very good books, I might not have finished this book.The individual stories (assignments) are ok, but nothing special. I do like the idea of the personality overlays, and how the stories are tied together.The ending was ok, and raised the rating from a 2 to a 2.5, rounded up to a 3.I would not recommend this book, unless you are a die hard Halderman fan.It's not a terrible book, it's ok, but there are many good (and better) books out there."
1,"Story ruined by ""hero""","This book was an enjoyable read, right up until the hero's proud declaration of his homophobia. I was so startled and disappointed that I dropped the book and never made it past that scene. There are any number of things I find attractive in a man, but surpisingly enough, homophobia is not one of them.It's always possible that the author somehow redeemed the male lead by the end of the book, but short of a miraculous epiphany, I can't imagine it. And I can't say I'm particularly interested in reading anything else by this author."
2,The Juliana Theory is not the same anymore,"Basically, if you liked The Juliana Theory with their first 'real' album, Understand This is a Dream - because of the emo-ish stuff -- you probably won't want this albumn unless you liked the stuff on their second album, Emotion is Dead.This album is very similar to Emotion is Dead.None of that poppy stuff like The Juliana Theory used to do."
1,"this girl is too in love with herself, made me sick doing it","i thought i was going to throw up if this acient was going to keep talking, she never shut up! the workout had potential, but i could never get over her non stop chatter, stop talking and work out! my gosh, Leisa hart nver does this, you would think other teachers would clue in and learn to instruct better, i did not like Petra and think she'll bug more people than just me"
5,"Excellent Read, Encouragement at it's Best","I absolutely loved this book. The story was long but the message was clear and to the point. Just think, if all fathers were this interested in their children's lives, what a wonderful world this would be. I too came from a family where we were encouraged to be the best and sometimes better than that, so this story took me back to my roots. It's a great story and could possibly be an awesome tool to motivate young readers."
5,Awesome,"Yes, I enjoyed reading the Ditchdigger's Daughters. It capitvated my attention right from the start. The dialogue helps the reader to visualize each individual character protrayed in the story. It is motivating and inspiring all in one. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something good to read. This book is well written and can help many who are stuggling to overcome some obsticules in life. By displaying that hard work can paid off, the father in this famliy play an very important role in the raising of his daughtrers. I would say this book deserves more than five stars. This family overcame there circumstances and provailed in the end. Read Ditchdiggers's Daughters you wont reget it, you will definately be moved my the tone of the story line."
2,Don't buy this game,"This game stinks. The graphics stink, the gameplay is unrealistic, and there is very little to do in the game. Don't waste your money like I did. If you want to snowboard buy ESPN X-Games Pro Boarder or Boarder Zone."
5,Probably the best Shooter EVER MADE!!!,"I've played this game in the arcades, and it has been one of the heaviest quarter munchers in many, many years. This shooter is absolutely amazing. The bullets will absolutely fill the screen and the ""Mosquito"" technique is a perfect idea.The shooter market is slowly dying and this game won't single handidly bring it back to life, however, that doesn't mean that any gamer should be without a gem like this in their collection.The game is insanely hard, but not frustrating, it manages to balance extreme difficulity and willingness to try again perfectly.The graphics are rather old fashioned, harking back to the older days of shooters. The bosses fill the screen and bullets fly everywhere.I felt that the sound was also quite good. The music stood out as being paticularly good for a shooter, but other then that, nothing amazing."
2,hefty hefty hefty,"These are martini GLASSES. That is, they are thick and clunky. There's no delicacy or nuance to them. Buy only if the price suits you or you like the swirl effect."
4,Fighting Traditionalism,"God has raised up the likes of Brian McLaren. I know that some are highly critical of him, but I am reminded of what the Lord said to his disciples when they saw a man casting out demons in the name of Jesus who was not in their company, ""Do not hinder hinder him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. For he who is not against us is for us"" (Mk 9:39, 40, NASB).While reading this book by McLaren, I realized now what is really important to Jesus. Our Lord wants us to know our culture in order to better communicate his message. And this is what McLaren has done in this book, calling the church to know this postmodern world in which we are living."
2,"""thrum.....""","I bought this for my Dad for Christmas. He's been plunking on a guitar for years.. and played well many years ago. He's been trying to get back into it, and was looking for some written instruction.He's never made any comment on it, so don't really know how to review this book."
1,Worst Instructional Book Ever!!!!,"I bought this book for my daughter who is a beginner at playing the guitar. She could not understand it, I could not understand it, & neither could my husband! It is written so outrageously stupid, I should just throw it in the trash! Lucky for yall, I don't believe in throwing things away that maybe someone else might be able to use. I will give it to a Thrift Store or sell it in my next yard sale for a whole quarter. Thanks alot for the loss! I will tell everyone NOT to buy this product!"
1,This is not for beginners.,I tried this book with some students and it was a nightmare. This is really a great book but for inter-advance guitarrist. Some of the tracks in the cd are completely unknown to foreign people and of course hard to follow. I don't recommend this book for beginners.
2,just ok,There is some good info in this book. The problem when I started chords was that I had no idea if they sounded right and since there is no audio with the kindle version I was frustrated.
3,Gitar for ummies,"This is very informative, easy to read and understand book. However, the disk in the back of the book simply would not play. We tried it on several devices with no success whatsoever. That's why I gave it 3 stars."
5,Excellent Lens but it doesn't allow for filters,"I purchased this item sight unseen. I did not realize that the lens was curved, like a fisheye lens. It will not take a protective UV filter or any other filter."
4,"Great man, good back, and dispicable counterfeit edition","I knew Father Moran in Kathmandu and the author does a wonderful job of accurately portraying this colorful character and his significant achievements in Nepal and influence world wide.Readers should only buy the edition by Orchid Press, the original publisher. The other edition with greatly inflated price is an unauthorized edition by well-known publishing pirates. Please avoid and buy the Orchid Press edition only."
1,This is a pirate edition breaking copyright laws !,"Poor old Father Moran would turn in his grave if he knew that State Mutual Book & Periodical Services Ldt. had illegally published his memoirs under ISBN 0785574387! The legal publisher is Orchid Press in Bangkok, and we trust amazon.com customers will buy the Orchid Press edition of the book, at less than half the price of this pirate edition! H K Kuloy, editor and publisher, Orchid Press"
1,Thrustmater Nascar Pro Digital 2 Steering Wheel,Very disappointed in this steering wheel. I have owned 2 other Thrustmaster wheels and they were reasonable quality for the money. This wheel seemed cheaper than previous Thrusmasters-and that was proven when it broke after a few weeks of occasional use. The left paddle shifter stopped working without warning. This will probably be my last Thrustmaster wheel. Now we will see how good Amazon's return program works.
2,MUST A HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE,"I borught this wheel from a retailer that said it was being dicontinued. So I guess I shouldn't have expected much, but the set-up for the actual wheel was great but the software was the problem it kept crashing my system when I removed the software the game and system would run fine but when you added the software back on to the system it would cause Nascar 4 to run super slow and the dreaded BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH would appear. So it wasn't quite the bargin I was looking for."
5,so much fun,this is my first wheel and i love it i play it every day and never had any problems with it. i use it with nascar 2002 and it works great
4,Thrustmaster Nascar Pro Digital 2,"I recently purchased the Nascar Pro Digital 2 wheel, and I'm very pleased so far. Structurally, it's clamping mechanism is very stable. In fact, I let my 2 year old bang around on it, and it has held up nicely. I can't see playing a Nasser Sims without it. I didn't give it a 5 star rating because there is always room for improvement. But for the price range, it offers more of the options that I was looking for."
1,"Great for occasional joyride, unacceptable for hardcore race","I have now owned my fourth wheel from Thrustmaster. They truly are the best bang for the buck. My dissapointment lies in the products reliablity. I'm on my fourth because the the other three preceeding it have expired. The potentiometers which control pedal function don't last long and the company's tech support and customer care are very inadequate. If you want a great toy for gaming, this is it. If you like to race, upgrade to a higher quality product or buy a couple extras for spares. You will need them."
2,WR gloves,"Gloves were okay. For the future, don't buy WR gloves online if you are a real wide receiver. Accidentally got yellow gloves, so they became my practice pair. They do good in the cold though."
4,Robo bashing fun with an RPG undertone,"As far as gameplay goes the robo battles are a blast, controls are precise (depending on your bot) and the graphics are some of the better on the DS yet. The game goes into molasses mode though when as a kid ala The Pokemon games you wander around school, your town etc.. this is where you start battles get parts for your bot etc... It is a cool RPGish system once you get into, but the kiddy feeling is inescapable. Cool game just slows way down when you aren't battling.Recommended for customization, robo fans with a high tolerance for dialogue and map wandering."
5,Captain Saturday,"This is the first Robert Inman book I have read. I heard Mr. Inman on NPR doing a book review with Rebecca Bain, mediator of a program called Fine Print.I enjoyed his program, so I wanted to get a copy of his book.How delightful is this book! This is not only a ""good southern book"", but it is meaningful to all who read it. It reminds us once again, it is our relationships to others (wifes, sons, relatives), that truly brings us happiness.Each of us has a little ""Will Baggett in us"". Have we not all built our image carefully, so that others see us one way and our family really knows the true person?Will Baggett is a survivor. After 9/11, we all need positive affirmations that no matter what happens we are the master of our own fate making mistakes, but also making corrections (along with a good dose of God's mercy).Read IT..I plan on getting other books by this author, right away."
3,Slick unit but DIFFICULT to find fuel for.,"Unit is light and compact and worked perfectly well (including ignition). Case is cheap but handy.The only complaint I have is that it was very difficult to find the right fuel canisters to run. Target didn't have them; Fred Meyer didn't have them; REI didn't have them... I did finally find them at a one-off sporting goods store (Outdoor Emporium, for you Seattleites). You can order them here on Amazon but you can only get them in packages of 6 or 12 and I didn't want to store them in my small apartment for the rest of my life (I don't camp that much).FYI: the canisters look like shaving cream cans with a fat lip with a notch in it to hook to the stove."
1,Nope,This book was a shameful waste of bucks after the introduction... Looks like they decided to include Red Hat on the cdroms at the last minute without updating any of the text.
3,Provides a basic intro to installing and running linux.,"Although this book was relatively well priced, it did not provide the depth that I expected to find in a linux book. If you are beyond the initial stages of running linux, I recommend that you consider other texts before puchasing this one."
5,Can't beat the price.,I feel this lens was a great deal for the price. The construction quality is solid like most D series lenses and its decently sharp. I use it for studio based product photography and don't have any complaints.
5,A Great Gift Idea!,"My son (5 mos old then)loved this toy last Christmas! He took the gingerbread man everywhere he went until he lost it. Then he took a liking to the lollipop and he chewed on it all the time. He got excited whenever he saw it. When he was older he liked to put the ""candy"" in and take it out. Each piece makes a different sound. They are like soft rattles only cuter! I would highly recommend this for a (young) baby gift."
4,good product,"This is exactly what I wanted. It arrived in a timely fashion and was well packaged and not damaged. I would recommend it to anyone looking for such a product. I am very pleased with how easy it is to use, the quality of the external material and the quality of the materials."
4,Big Bowl,"Great looking dog bowl. Kinda heavy, but I guess that keeps it from scooting around when by golden is trying to get the last drop of food out of it. Don't bang your spoon on side when putting in canned food, as like any ceramic dish, the ceramic and paint will chip away."
2,Very Dissapointed,"Usually Slappa's products are top of the line, but not this bag. I might've just gotten a defective bag and I am now in the process of getting either a new one, or a new model. I've had the bag for a little over a month and so far the main clip has broken and one of the clips on the shoulder strap has fallen out. The bag really isn't that big and it's hard to fit more than just your laptop in there. I have a travel mouse, my laptop, and the powercord that I carry around in this bag and it's more than bulky. I do not recommend this bag, get a targus."
3,READ THE DIMENSIONS!!...but cute little book,Book was a fun addition to a beer-themed gift! But i also did not read the reviews nor the dimensions I assumed the book was full sized not stocking stuffer size....my fault though not the sellers ...good for a college kid. or the person who always has a beer in thier hand.
1,Two Broke!,"Hey look, I had to hunt this piece of crap down on Amazon to let all you buying prospects know that this controller it NOT for serious gamers. I was playing NFS: Underground when and was turning using the far left digital control to steer and the thing broke! I'm like ""Ok, this must be a Friday controller"" so I borrowed another and IT broke, too! I'm not THAT hard on the controller, either, it's just turning. It broke at the connection, in the same place both times. I recommend looking for something else as your main gaming controller."
2,Better cable modems are available,"In brief, I bought the modem and it worked ok for about a month. After that period, I began having intermittent connection failures, lasting a few seconds to a few minutes at a time. After my ISP checked out their end, they sent a tech to replace the BestData modem with a Motorola Surfboard 4100. I've had no problems since, and it's been a number of months now.Note that they replaced my modem at their own cost. I've my own suspicions about what this might mean, particularly since they recommended the model."
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed because I assumed this book would contain a very obvious candy...hard candies! It did not. I had intended to attempt making healthful, sugar free lollypops for my kids and wanted a place to start but this book did not help me with that type of candy making."
5,Easy to follow these recipes,I bought this book for my daughter whom loves to make and experiment with candy recipes. I enjoy the fact that I have access to the book online! It's like a 2 for 1 special. Love that!
2,I wasnt pleased!,I went to this movie with an open mind last night and I respect anything that Dallas Gilbert has found. I wasn't pleased that it involved Tom Biscardi (a known hoaxer). I believe Gilbert's findings are concrete and he seem to know what he was doing when they (his calls were impressive as he tried do some 'chatter') went out to do research. Im glad I didn't by this though because I would've gotten rid of it after the first viewing. Gilbert's friend Wayne talks about how he was suicidal at one point in his life and he still has thoughts about things like that. A serious researcher would never put that in a movie concerning Sasquatch.Time and time again Biscardi has been caught with known hoaxers or trying to doctor something to make it look genuine. I believe the movie was funded with his efforts and I wouldnt consider watching this movie again much less purchasing it.
5,Touching movie!,"This movie was very cool, humorous, and touching. Dallas and Wayne are humble, passionate people...I loved how this movie reflected their raw emotions. It's obvious they care deeply about their quests, their families, and one another. No matter what corner of life you're from...this movie depicts the hardship of their lives, and what it takes to find the ""something"" in life that makes you happy, and gets you to strive onward.Definitely not typical....I didn't know what to expect, glad I watched it.... and I would watch it again too."
1,i threw this CD away,"The person who wrote that this was an instrumental was mistaken. There is another album with a similar name that IS instrumental. I bought this thinking it was, thanks to that guy's mistake. This CD is the worst CD I ever heard! What a hack!"
1,"If this is a tribute, I'd hate to see an insult","Good grief. This is really not good. Some guys with a D-50 and a bathroom stall recorded an album. If you don't believe how bad this really is, listen to the track snippet from ""Entertainer"". Holy cow, is it ever atrocious."
1,Was that a mistake?,"I've been thinking of purchasing the new cd, ""A Tribute to Billy Joel"" by various artists. I haven't been able to find much info on it, so I was glad to see the previous review. But, I think the reviewer was actually reviewing a different cd, called, ""Piano Man: A Tribute to Billy Joel"" by pianist Jeff Michaels. That one *is* completely instrumental, but the new tribute album has vocals. I've heard 30 second snippets of each of the songs on a different website, but would appreciate input from someone who has the new tribute cd."
3,"This is the bonus workout from ""AM PM Pilates Mat Workouts""","""Energy Boost Pilates"" is the bonus 15-minute workout from ""AM PM Pilates Mat Work"" with Jillian Hessel and Ana Caban.Ana's alone outside by a pond with lots of plants and trees surrounding her. She cues in voiceover and she starts out with standing stretches. Then she has you jog, do jumping jacks and front-to-back lunges to ""boost energy"" with these short cardio moves. Then you roll down onto the mat for the hundreds, roll ups, leg stretches, the tree, shoulder bridge, the mermaid, etc.There isn't much instructions for those new to pilates and Ana assumes familiarity with the poses. There's no demonstrations or suggestions for modifications, either."
5,Reviewing Used DVD,"I purchased this DVD as used. It was in excellent condition. It was like brand new. I will continue to order used DVD because it is afforable. Even more so, if you plan to purchase more than two or three.The movie was excellent. I love Stephen Moyer."
2,What were they thinking???,"By reading the reviews on this movie, I thought that it might actually be pretty good. Once I got it and started watched it, I was very dissappointed. The acting was just OK and not enough was done with the movie. Not worth it."
5,Perfect Price,"I would say, for those seriously interested in magic, you should skip this abbridgement and get Mark Wilson's Complete Course instead, but for such a low price ($10 for the paperback, not to be confused with the expanded hard-bound edition), this book actually proves to be the best idea for those interested in magic but still testing the water before jumping in. While some neat classics have been left out, there is still plenty to keep a beginner busy for months or even years! And none of the lame tricks that rely more on good patter than sleight of hand--these are real magic tricks. I haven't seen as good a book anywhere near this price."
2,Buy the real book,"This is a severely condensed version of Wilson's ""Complete Course in Magic."" While it may be helpful to have things boiled down to essentials, the editing is careless and some tricks are missing steps or crucial commentary. Even worse, this tight little paperback is nearly impossible to keep open while learning the moves. Go buy the original and skip this flawed excuse for a re-release."
4,My daughter loves it,"My daughter asked for the Magic of the Rainbow Barbie movie for her birthday. It was great to get two excellent Barbie movies together and my daughter loved it. I only gave 4 stars because I ordered another movie from another amazon vendor, both were shipped on same day but this one came 2 days later than the other. I paid for expedited shipping on both. It was technically still delivered within promised time frame but regular delivery and expedited delivery timeframes are overlapping which is ridiculous. If you pay extra they should be able to guarantee a quicker delivery than standard fees promise. But the movie was great, it was still delivered before my daughter's birthday and I would definitely use this vendor again."
1,big mistake,"Howard Kaplan can't pronounce Yiddish, and he doesn't even try. The delivery is flat and at times ""hammy"". This cd is treff ,and not for Jewish people."
5,"For what it is, it is perfect","If you are looking at this lens, you will probably already know what it is. Within the limitations of it's design, it is perfect and a real classic.Having said that, it is what it is. Obviously it is a Prime Lens, not a zoom, so you have to want that. And also clearly it is an old design - no AF-S, no VR. But, you already knew that didn't you?Bokeh, especially wide open, is wonderful... This is the reason people buy this lens.Build quality could not be better. All metal construction. You could use it to hammer nails if the need arose. It also feels great in the hand (I have it mounted on a D700 with battery grip).Only slight irritation (not worth deducting a star for) is the lens hood. It is a screw in design, not a quick bayonnet mount and can not be reversed for storage. When mounted it is slighly tricky to get the lens cap securely on (I had it falling off a few times). However, it is a good, solid metal hood so will also give some physical protection."
4,Barely used it yet,"This is less a review than a correction to Amazon's description of the product pending the update I requested. This lens does not as stated come with an 72mm lens cap. It comes with a 77mm lens cap, and uses 77mm filters. I had to return the filters I bought with this lens, since they were the wrong size. Check out the Nikon USA and Adorama web sites for confirmation on this."
1,Putrid,"There's nothing wrong with tribute bands. Great White released a very good tribute to Led Zeppelin's work. However, this is album is not a tribute but a blatant attempt at confusing people into spending their money. I don't know how the people who released this album got the rights to record the music, but it never should have happened. The singer is a fairly pedestrian hard rock kind of guy. He's no Robert Plant, but he's got pipes. Unfortunately, he's the best this album has to offer. The entire disc sounds like the singer is doing his thing over synthesized backing tracks, the kind of robotic noise you'd get on a CD with a ""How To Play Guitar"" book. I don't think that anyone could truly enjoy this soulless effort; the people who rated this album any more than one star probably work for the record company. Buy the real thing, buy the Great White tribute, buy ANYTHING but this."
1,Tribute? You Gotta Be Kidding Me!,"OMG! I think I'm gonna be sick!!!! Don't buy this. Money is too hard to come by these days. If you have to waste it on something, waste it on something worthwhile, definetly NOT this! This is just plain wrong."
3,"Groovey, dude.","I like it. It's generic but entertaining. Lord knows I can't listen to Zep IV 100 times in a row and I envy people who can do that, but for the rest of us a nice little twist on an amazing album is a good thing.Peace & love"
1,Run Don't Walk To An Alternative,I purchased this software at an Office Store and am extremely disapointed. This is Web based so the software itself only points you to a Web site. It won't allow me to register the computer I'm trying to protect and customer service hasn't replied to my email. If you want to put it on a second computer they direct you to their site to buy another license for $50.00.There are much better alternatives cheaper or even free out there.
2,Dont waste your time and money,"I bought the ATI AllInWonder Radeon, and was so unhappy with the drivers that I will never buy ATI again. The AllInWonder cannot be used with Windows Media Encoder or RealProducer due to ATI's drivers. It has been a year and they still haven't fixed it. It took ATI months to come out with a good OpenGL driver. Using the ATITv app, going full screen locks up the system. Poor tech support on top of it.The GuidePlus system is REALLY slow at downloading guide data...regardless of your connection speed."
1,THIS THING STINKS,"Well personally, my old VooDoo 16 AGP BYTES WAS BETTER! MY OLD VOODOO was better! my pet dog can draw better than this piece of junk. DON'T WASTE YOUR CAH. RADEON STINKS IT IS FLIMSY"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Faceless reverb-drone overproduced alt-rock. I guess i can't say it's not pleasant, but it sounds like the whole album could have been made with synthesized samples rather than actual instruments and most of the composition rigidly adheres to basic commercial formulas at the expense of any memorable hooks or distinct melodic impact. It's completely mechanized and personalityless, approaching music as a product rather than art."
4,"good job, guys","Most KH fans have been waiting on the edge of their seats for a new album, basically since For Never and Ever came out. Never expecting the band to disappoint, when the new album did come out I can say it was a tad different than what I anticipated. True to the music industry, they did tone down their edgyness a bit and add more pop. Bands are ever evolving, however, and KH did an amazing job, regardless. Using synth with heavy guitars and bass adds a unique quality the band is adored for, and Mat's voice blends in amazingly well with the music. Songs like ""Believer"", ""Lips Like Morphine"", and ""Crazy Angel"" gave us what we're used to, and others like ""Love You to Death"" gave us a bit more of a pop sound from the guys. My personal favorite is ""Scream"", which is a beautiful track that uses vivid imagery.Good job, KH! Can't wait for the next one =)"
5,Liftmaster Garage Door Opener,The device has worked flawlessly. It was exactly what I needed and was a breeze to install and program.
3,101 things to do before you die,"This is a fun coffee table book - only! I like to travel and have lived in many different countries, so I liked the allure of doing more interesting things. But, this book is just for fun reading. God forbid you do most of things in here! Some are genuinely interesting things to do while others are simply stunts which would make your drunken (and retarded) mates proud. Overall, fun book I don't regret buying. But sure what your buying - a fun read. That's it."
4,Incredible value for Macro - slower AF,"When I first got this lens, it surprised me with the picture sharpness and very good bokeh. The bokeh appeared to be halo discs instead of diffused orbs but still good in my book. I used it for close-up's and people shots plenty. The simplicity but solid construction was striking, but the AF can be awful on close-up and a tad slow at times and hunts--stick with limit versus full zoom range for close-up's. For macro use over manual focus no problem of course; the focus ring is a tad tight and small IMO.Optically it's brilliant with plenty sharpness to the edge. However, unless you need macro, I would take the 50mm f/1.8G or the 85mm f/1.8G instead."
1,Works well...ONCE,"What's the saying? Fool me once...Well, shame on me. I bought a single zone Raindrip last year, but figured it failed because I didn't screw the cover on tight enough. Apparently not. I bought a two zone which lasted about six days still I shut it off to do some yardwork. Upon trying to turn it back on it would:Turn on whenever the reset setting was on, turn on zone 2 when trying to set zone 1 (Zone two's knobs having NEVER been turned even one click), Run in the OFF position, Turn off in the ON position. And basically fail in each and every way imaginable. Well OK, not every way, the seal worked pretty well so at least I never had problems with it leaking from the spigot.Raindrip = Fresno's biggest shame - and that's saying A LOT!"
1,Failed within 6 months with valve stuck open,"This thing died during the first season I bought it, with the valve stuck open. Replacing the batteries didn't help - it just continuously ran the motor trying to close the valve. Stay away."
1,Size options suck!,"I wanted to buy a pair of DR Martens here in Amazon, but I couldn't because the size options are like from some weird planet...Does anybody knows what the hell this means:???F (M)B (M)D (M)I am just trying to get size 9 US. This website is for America's users, why these stupid people put the size options like that???"
1,Absolute rubbish,Bitterly disappointed in the Chinese manufacture. I thought at least the sizes would be true Doc Marten but they are typical smaller Chinese. I wish I had purchased the original UK brand.
2,Disappointed,"I felt like revisiting my youth during high school and got a pair for my birthday. Ishould have researched the fact that they are made in China now. They certainly felt different when I put them on and some product flaws I experienced in the past are still present: the cheap shoelaces lasted 2 weeks, YOU MUST buy inserts soles of some kind,and the fabric on the inside heels(both shoes) deteriorated somewhat causing discomfort especially if you wear thin or cheap socks. You shouldn't have to augment a shoe that costs $100. This all happened once again within the space of a month. Oh well, that's what you get for shopping for shoes online. But hey, they look great."
5,"My first workout video, and still a favourite","I got this tape when it first came out years ago - it was the first workout video I'd ever owned, and even after all these years, I still love it.Okay, so Elle's forced perkiness is a bit annoying, but if you can zone out and ignore her, Karen has put together a great workout which has changed as my fitness has improved - you can easily modify the intensity of the moves for your fitness level.I really enjoy the circuit training style, and this is the video that definitely got me addicted to Karen's workouts - every time I've done this workout, at the end I've always wanted Karen's body, not Elle's."
5,Ordering my 2nd copy,"I'm ordering my second copy of this exercise tape. My first one finally gave out after years of use. I'm glad Amazon still carries it. This is a great workout tape! It's fun to do and very effective. This tape has one of the best ab exercise that I know. It also has great workout using hand weights. My only complaint is that they still sell this as a VHS tape instead of DVD. Luckily, my machine plays both. Some things are timeless. This workout is one of them."
3,Your Personal Best Workout,"This workout was not much fun or challenge. If you are fairly fit you want even feel it working for you, and Elle is just plain annoying. If you want to see results and enjoy the workout try Cindy Crawford's Next Challange workout instead."
1,Right product LONG delay in delivery,I ordered this product and it took OVER A MONTH to arrive ---MUCH too long. Thankfully I ordered in advance of my need for them but had it been a different situation I would have been even more disappointed.
5,A Must For Adult Mental Health Clinicians,"MacFarlane has bridged the gap between individual psychotherapy and family systems. I found the book to be comprehensive and well written. MacFarlane has organized the topics so that I could pick up one text covering the problems that my adult clients present with. I've pulled it out to review a specific chapter after working with a particular client. Finally a book that has relevant research and theory, but is focussed on enabling the clinician who is working in the field."
5,A rough ride indeed,"Kimmage rode with some of the greats of cycling, but was only in the cold shadow of greatness in terms of ability. He details in the book the means taken by some cyclists to climb out of the shadows into the sunshine by taking drugs. His book was brave at the time, he was accused of 'spitting in the soup' and lost the friendship of many of his cycling peers for his writing about the drug taking. He was called a liar. But time has revealed through the 'festina affair' who were the liars. A good read, but leaves one feeling a little sad to think that sport in general, not just cycling, can be so diseased."
4,Well worth reading,"This book is now very relevant given the release of the USADA Reasoned Decision on Lance Armstrong and the UCI's legal suit against Paul Kimmage. Paul gives an unvarnished view of the life of a pro cyclist. It's not nearly as glamorous as it appears on television, and there are more pressures than one would suspect. His description of what it's like to ride a race on amphetamines was eye-opening, as well as being a little scary. It's a good insight into his world, is well written and I'm glad I bought it."
4,paul kimmage,"Well written, giving a great insight to the world of professional cycling and exposing the use of performing enhancing drugs in a very tough and demanding sport."
3,Just another RPG,"Having been a big fan of the first Heretic when it was out, as well as playing both Hexen and Hexen 2, I wanted to get this to complete my collection. Unfortunately it's not set up like all of the others.Setup similar to a Tomb Raider style of control, you have to learn a number of moves with your character. Thus taking away the easy transition in from the earlier game in this series. Don't get me wrong, I actually really love Tomb Raider and other games like it. Though when I went to play this one it just wasn't what I was expecting.Overall the game is well done once you get used to the new controls. The story line is intriguing and allows you to get more into the game. Graphics and Music are also fairly well done. I was just a little thrown off by the change from what I was used to."
4,The Measure of a Man,"The book starts a little slow, but becomes very interesting. All aspiring actors and actresses should read this book."
3,Disappointed with language,"Was very disappointed that such a role model would use offensive language. The thoughts and message in the book are very insightful and motivating, but the language does not go with the message. What he is saying does not go with how it is said."
4,Interesting read,I am almost finished with this book and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not that the writing is brilliant or his insights exceptionally original; but I appreciate reading the story of a man who has accomplished a lot and been a role model for many. I'm also impressed by his experiences and perspectives as an African American throughout the 20th century. I have a hard time imagining I would have handled such a life as nobly as he has.
5,A delightful read!,"I borrowed this book from the local library not knowing what to expect, and liked it so much that I just bought a copy of my own. As a former caribbean native the wonderful stories about his childhood growing up on Cat island in the Bahamas brought back many fond memories of my own. Mr Poitier's writings are like that of a beloved grandfather telling stories about his life. And such an eventful life he's lead! Rather then letting the times he lived in limit him as an actor and human being, he found ways to go around and rise above the segragation and regulations that were imposed on colored people in those early days of his career. I hope he'll find a way to realize his dream of a one-man-show on broadway!A fun and inspirational read!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought the audio book to listen to Mr. Poitier reveal some deep secrets on life but was disappointed on many levels. There is an arrogant thread that runs through this and to call it 'spiritual' is a little deceptive. Mr. Poitier does not believe in God but in 'nature' and 'galaxies'. Also, he tends to romanticize his adultery and breakup of his home as 'being in love'. A native of the Caribbean, I can understand how being placed in a box when you are coming from a culture where you are majority can be jolting. But there is a difference between being confident in one's ability and God-given talents and arrogance. On the other hand, the book does give insightful information on what race relations were in the US and in some part still is in Hollywood. Overall, I would not recommend this book unless you want to hear of someone who is clearly in love with himself and his talents."
5,beverly wg,"I bought and read the hardcover of Mr. Poitier's book in 2000, and his open and honest comments about his life from childhood to that time were riveting. Others in the same shoes would have given up. His stories and career are indicative of how he is THE best example of living his life exemplying the tenants by which he judges THE MEASURE OF A MAN -- as a son, father, human being, and admired actor. I'm glad Oprah chose this selection for those who didn't know about this book. I look forward to her Feb. 22 dinner party featuring Mr. Poitier as her guest. To listen to him speak on any subject is to hear the voice of an angel."
2,boring and soapboxy,"I thought this book would be more autobiographical and less of his personalopinions about life. I got bored after only a few chapters and skimmed the 2nd half of the book. Unfortunately, SP is not a good writer and it SHOWS. The book skips from one time period to the next and back again without much rhyme or reason to it. I am a big fan of his acting and this was a real disappointment. Don't bother with this one."
4,one of the best!,"I'm a big fan of Sidney Poitier the actor. I think he is one of the best actors of my lifetime. I found ""The Measure of a Man"" a quick fascinating read. Not the ""tell-all"" Hollywood type book I expected, instead Mr. Poitier gives us his views on life, based on his early beginnings.After this reading, I can't wait to get my hands on ""This Life"", his other book that delves more into his life in the entertainment industry."
3,Leave u wanting more,"Although I have been always a big fan of Sidney Poitier and watched his movies and watched his seldom interviews, the book left me wanting more.I was very anxious to read the book, to find out about Poitier, however I was looking for more information on his personal life, and there were many unanswered questions about some of the subjects he brought up, seemed like there was lacking information and details.However, how can u not read his book, the man that is quite recluse, but as I read the book, I imagined his calm soothing voice as I read the words, leaving me with wanting to hear more about the knowledgeable man, more details, more information, with more and more of Poitier.. The book was short, perhaps lacking details, but I will take what I can from Sydney Poitier."
3,The Measure of a Man,"Sidney Poitier is an amazing man, with a wonderful story. The part of this publication that was quite interesting was the autobiographical portion, which accounts for about half the book.The portion that was a reflection of Mr. Poitier's philosophy, and 'learnings' about life which he has accumulated during his span on this earth are mundane, boring, and frankly, hard to follow.The book is worth reading for the first part, but be aware of the drawbacks mentioned."
5,nicks review,It was great! The condition was superb it was exactly what I wanted there weren't any tears or creased pages
3,Good for theoreticians,"This is a good book for those are interested in the details of optical physics, the thoerms and the equations that govern that science.For folks who are from computer networking background looking to take on the new world of optical communications from a network application & design perspective, this book may not be the right one.I am a network designer from one of the big-3, hoping to break into this field, and I found that this was not the right book for me. It does not touch the details of IP over glass or ATM over glass.For those of us who intend to do a course in Fiber Optics, or get into the hardware design of optical equipment this should be useful."
2,This Book Is Definitely OFF Track!!!,"This book was a big disappointment for me. I bought this title for the tracking information and only received maybe twenty pages out of a book of 192 pages! I know when I bough the book it would have a good portion dedicated to navigation, but why not call the book &#65533;Navigation and Tracking&#65533; or take tracking out of the title. Well as far as the content on navigation it is quite good, the tracking section just seems to be a regurgitation of Bob Carss book &#65533;SAS Guide to Tracking&#65533; which I recommend over this title for tracking."
5,MacBook Pro 17 inch,"Wow, what a machine. I can't say enough about it. I was a Mac user back in the fat Mac days, but had to switch to PCs for work. After 12 years using windows, I finally came back home. Like the prodigal son, I am returning with awe and wonder. Thanks for the great machine. I especially like the fact that the operating system is so stable. I was always troubleshooting my internet security and virus protection programs. Lots of conflicts with windows and none here. The MacBook Pro keyboard is solid to touch and the speakers sound great by themselves. THe screen size is great and resolution is good. I especially like being able to have the computer on at nite and not having to have a light on. The keyboard is backlite, so no problems typing in the dark. I have had about 3 portables before this one, so I'm not new to portable computers. I highly recommend the MacBook Pro... for those who want the best and are willing to pay a little more for it. Its worth the extra dollars!"
2,"Not for those desiring a chronological, blow-by-blow account","Those desiring a chronological, blow-by-blow account of Topp's wartime U-Boat exploits will be disappointed. Topp spends a fair amount of time examining and condemning the philosophical problems that led to the rise of the Nazis, but at the end of the day cannot propose a philosophical system to keep such a travesty from recurring, other than via vague references to ""tradition."""
4,Very good - with a couple of reservations...,"On the plus side, this imaginative realisation of Offenbach's masterpiece has the added bonus of superb dancing from Shearer and Helpman. On the minus side, Rounseville, though a very fine singer, is a very wooden actor. Also, anyone who is put off by the many revisions of, and additions to Offenbach's score will not be pleased by what they hear in this video. Finally, the Antonia act is boring. Still, I recommend this video because of the superb work in the prologue and in the Olympia and Giulietta acts."
1,I think I'll wait for a SMS 2.0 book,"Thanks for all the reviews, I believe I too will wait for a SMS 2.0 book to be released."
1,A Clear Case of Misrepresentation by the Author & Publisher,"I bought this book from a chain retailer, read a few chapters out of sequence and tried out the CD-ROM. I was so shocked at the errors, the old SMS 1.2 screen shots, the wrongly labelled CD, and the lack of any attempt by the author or publisher to clarify which version of SMS was being represented, I returned the book the next day armed with testimonials from other reviewers. I felt defrauded. This is a clear case of misrepresentation by a publisher/author whose only concern was to be first on the shelf with the latest, hot training guide."
3,Precipitation chart way off,"This is fine product--Rainbird sprinkler heads are well-made and function well. However, the chart next to the photo on the Amazon site is deceiving. It lists the precipitation rate in inches per hour that this head can deliver. Unfortunately these numbers are way off--by a factor of six! This is the result of a small part of a chart from the manufacturer's website being recreated here without the footnotes: this rate assumes overlap from other sprinkler heads nearby--a 20' spacing if your spray radius is 40'. So instead of putting down a half inch of water per hour, you're only putting down one sixth of that! The snippet of a chart here defies physics.I give the product 3* because it can't meet the numbers as advertised by Amazon."
5,good quality,The original plastic one that came with the Rain bird did not hold up and this one is metal. I'm very happy with it.
3,Shania's come a long way,"I've been a Shania Twain fan from her first album and it was very interesting hearing this CD. It seemed to me that she was holding herself in and there wasn't the emotion or passion that are in her other recordings. There was a bit of ""Madonna"" to most of the songs but I think she did a good job on ""Half Breed"". I would reccommend that any fan of Shania's get this CD for their collection. It's interesting to hear how far she's come."
1,This cd shows pure talent,"I'm referring to Mutt. This cd shows how bad of a singer Shania really is and how talented Mutt is. Mutt can record a baby goat or a howling wolf, edit the sound and make it sound like music. This CD gives this listener a chance to hear Shania in her ""REAL"" voice. Not with all the robotic editng Mutt does. It's Shania's real voice........ BAD!"
1,the heart is blind ................ and bland.,"bad bad bad - beyond belief.I hate it.Thank goodness i didn't have to spend MY money of it.Save your money foe a better cause like her latest album ""UP!"" Or something totally different - just don't buy this."
1,sloooooooow!,"Excited at first to read the book, I quickly became disappointed. The plot seems great. The character development is simplistic. Most reviews say this is a good read for civil war buffs. I disagree. The historical aspect of the book is basic. The fictional part is imaginative, but the characters become annoying and the plot lumbers along. It is a quick, easy, thoughtless read. (try Landscape Turned Red by Sears for a great factual interpretation of the battle)"
3,Way below expectations,"I was expecting a grand adventure, after all the party was supposed to save a goddess.Perhaps its because of ""under the dark fist"", ""bloodstone"" or even ""dead gods"". But this module did not even apporach the fascination and pure power portrayed by the above modules. Heck even the ""desert of desolation"" was better because it had a storyline that made railroading the pcs seem less obvious.Frankly from the appearence of wakeen, which comes only very very close to the end, i would not be surprised if the party attempted to sell her back to what's his name.Basically you had no possibility of even going through what's his name's palace.The only way to save wakeen was by the method ""suggested"" in the module and the straw that broke the camel's back was that the goddess would be saved no matter what. Even if you failed, some nameless npcs would save her.So the best way to describe this module is ""DUH"""
3,OK but not great,"I highly anticipated this books publication, and I was only mildly disappointed. I abhor planescape and thankfully this book has a reduced amount of it..easilly thrown where it belongs(the trash). The rest of the adventure is adaptable and the ideas are good. Overall a worthy module."
1,Don't Buy This,"This is a very crude and unreadable scan of an 1885 book. It seems to have been scanned with an optical character reader and printed without any proofreading at all. There are numerous and confusing typos in the text, but the worst part is the mangling of headings and footnotes. These are scattered at seemingly random points throughout the text. One moment you're reading a paragraph of the text, and the next word that comes up begins a line from a footnote or chapter heading. The publishers could have fixed this with even a cursory proofreading. As it stands, I regard this as unreadable and am demanding a refund."
3,Doesn't stay on as described,"I bought this pounce because I hate having blue lines running through my quilt top from marking with water soluble pens. I had read reviews on the website and on here, and figured it was worth a shot. I had to remark my quilt using a stencil 3 times. The chalk just faded away and I could barely see it in some areas. For that single quilt I also used about half of the powder that comes with it. It did iron off nicely - what stayed on that is. I would like to try the blue powder and see if it is more favorable, but hesitant to order more. This wasn't my first quilt or marking experience. I gave it 3 stars because compared to some other products I have used, it is a little more manageable."
4,"Good show, old man....",Great book but I can't seem to find any mention of the 916 model other than the title and the photo on the cover
1,I can leave this behind.,"Unlike the other reviewers, I'm actually going to review this single instead of the whole album, since this is technically the page for the single. ""Vertigo"" is by far one of the most ridiculous songs I've ever heard. ""Uno,dos,tres,catorce""??? One, two, three, fourteen?? That's just stupid. And the back up vocals yelling ""ola"" are contrived and pointless. I have friends who love Top 40 radio crap, and even they think this song is terrible. And who can argue with lyrics as profound as ""yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah..."" Thanks Bono, for proving once and for all that you are full of yourself."
4,A relief,"After explosion and shooting movies, people putting on capes and flying through the air to save the world movies, and let's not forget the Mind-bending psycho-babble-angst-ridden movies that critics seem to love... it was really nice to just watch a good story about two people. Man, what a relief. I think I'll look for some more like this."
4,Nice Romantic Flick,"Both characters (Jenna Fischer, Topher Grace) were played painfully dependant which only made their growth more satisfying. This was a story where two people just right for each other find themselves in time. Well done!"
5,Cute romantic film.,"I thought this movie was just great. It was a really cute story about 2 awkward people finding each other. It's short and a little predictable, but the acting is spot-on and a joy to watch. If you like semi-quirky romantic movies, you'll like this one. It's refreshing to see a movie with zero CGI, and zero profanity or sex. Just a nice story."
2,"Chick-flick, predictable storyline","Some top-notch actors in the film; however, I found the movie very predictable and rather slow - interesting that it has 4.5 stars. I did complete the movie in one sitting but I wouldn't watch it again. I thought Jenna Fischer (The Office) did a good job keeping the movie moving along but I wouldn't rate her performance as anything more than decent. I was ready for a little comedy but there was none in here. There are much better movies to watch so don't waste your time on this one."
3,Cute and quirky,Nice easy watch. Without unnecessary drama. Easy acting from most of the cast. A good time pass. Go ahead and enjoy it!
4,original and captivating in an indie sort of way,I really liked the film. After watching most films you feel like you were entertained maybe even inspired but this film engages you in a unique way and you feel like you have walked away with something more.
1,THIS BOOK IS A MORAL COLLAPSE!!,"Mr Bennet says nothing every other right wing looney has been sceeching for a decade! The Gays will destroy us! Divorce will ruin us! The Liberals are taking this country to H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS!! The Founding Fathers Mr Bennet is so fond of were Radicals, aka Liberals, not Reactionaries, aka Conservatives. Jefferson, Washington, Madison and Paine were the people who started this country,they believed in the rights of the accused, seperation of powers, division of church and state. The conservatives went back to England!! Please Mr Bennet, go back to England: The England of 1777, where your prejudices and narrow mindedness can find a happier home than here in this awful, liberal, radical, wonderful country!!!!"
3,Mind the gap,"This video goes into great detail on the different strokes and claps and where and how to hit the drum head. However, that takes a little over 50 of the 70 minutes of the tape. Then he explains three different basic rhythms. The distance between the simplicity of these rhythms and the -- pretty cool -- solos he's been doing throughout the video is enormous, and what's more, it's never really bridged. It's left up to the viewer to figure out what the relation is between these simple rhythms and a complicated percussion part. I could have used 20 minutes of examples and exercises of how to fill in the empty spaces in the rhythm. As it is, I can not recommend this as a beginners video. Maybe as a second one, in addition to one that talks more about the music and less about the technique. As a technique video it's good, though."
4,Excellent Film Noir,"Very effective direction, beautifully constrasted photography and solid acting make this one an instant classic.Widmark is terrific as a hand-gun on the psychotic side (his breakthrough role) and Mature is dead-on as Nick Bianco : manly, natural, a tough-as-nails-with-a-soft-spot kind of character that suits him perfectly.The girl is good looking but her acting is so-so... which doesn't make the film any less enjoyable with its mixture of realism, sensitivity and hair-raising suspense."
5,Awesome movie,"When I viewed this movie I kept rerunning the part where Widmark pushes the old woman to her death down the stairway. I always in my mind change myself into Widmark and imagine the old woman being my Mother in Law and that really makes my whole week!! Man oh man, that would be so sweet.......but I digress. This is a classic old movie of great quality and I believe it was Mr. Widmarks debut and he played an awesome bad guy with the most wicked giggle you have ever heard. But the greatest part is that the old woman looks so much like ""THE BEAST"", my Mother in Laws nickname, that it makes it really easy to transpose their images in my minds eye in one of my favorite fantasies!!!!It is also an excellent example of American film noir and it doesnt have that midget Alan Ladd or that weird looking Veronica Lake in it, both midgets and midgets are bad luck!"
4,exceptionally good film noir,"This is exceptionally well scripted and directed. The dialogue is spare and to the point; almost none is included just for the sake of 'having people talking', and some long, almost silent scenes are among the most effective, rivetting one's attention. In addition, Victor Mature and Richard Widmark are both mesmerising in their different ways. Whoever said that Mature couldn't act? I have now seen him in three old films in the last couple of years ('I Wake Up Screaming', 'My Darling Clementine' and this one) and he is first rate in them all. Highly recommended."
1,Stay away from this album.,This is more like Morricone light-1 to 3 min versions of his classic music...They could use this version of his music to set Car Adverts on TV-Shoot they probably will now.
4,Prefect blend,"I'm not a fan of western movies, my husband is. But I had to admit the music is awesome, classic but everybody knows it."
5,I wish I had known about this sooner...,"I have been suffering from RLS for years. I have a sister with the same issue and the prescription she was given caused other problems so I have been looking for non prescription remedies and have tried all sorts of things. I received this as a sample when I purchased something else from this company. The info page sent with it indicated that it was for the relief of muscel spasms, tension and stess. It didn't mention any type of relief for RLS but I figured, whet the heck, why not try it. I must say I had the best night of sleep I have had in years. I woke up once to go to the bathroom but quickly fell back to sleep. I am now out of the the 6 sample pills they sent and after spending another restless night I am desperate for more. Especially now that I really remember what a good nights sleep feels like. I REALLY do wish I had known about this product sooner!!!!!"
3,Swearing Included,This would have been great had it not been for the swearing a few times (taking the Lord's name in vain).
4,Bionic Woman,"I have been waiting for the Bionic Woman series for a long, long time. I have not been disappointed with Season 1 DVD set. I have not completed watching the DVD set because I want to make it last for several weeks. Who knows when the 2nd season will come out. Watching the show, it brings back good childhood memories. I am seeing it with different eyes than when I watched it in the 70's; however, I am truly enjoying it."
5,nothing but the best!,"bionic women was before my time but i still saw all the re-runs and movies through out the late 80's and early 90's. and i loved it all. most of the 70's tv series were horrible but the bionic women was one of the few that i can treasure as a classic. in my generation of hillary duff, and spears fan's, it would be nice to have this on dvd to show how a real woman should look and act.i beg of you!"
4,GUILTY PLEASURE,"Bill Pullman stars as a cocky, self-assured federal judge-to-be who seems to get away with murder..or does he? Pullman takes his secretary out, and in a fit of drunken stupor, rapes her. She threatens to expose him; he decides to hire someone to kill her. Director Anthony Waller keeps the pace a little slow, but does manage some great camera angles and a few plot twists to save the day. Devon Sawa, Gabrielle Anwar, Joanne Whalley and Angela Featherstone provide good support and the ending is a real doozy!A nice change of pace mystery."
3,Does not fit Infiniti G35,The Amazon Part Finder indicates this blade fits the 2007 G35 Sport Sedan. In fact it is too long to fit.
2,Doesn't fit a Hummer H3,"The local stores did not have a blade that fit the rear window for a Hummer H3. Bought this based on the Amazon auto part selection saying this one would work. First with the tire, the opening is too small to get in because the blade can't be angled enough. After overcoming that, the blade doesn't lock into the wiper bar - tab too wide. Won't try this brand again."
1,Not worth shipping to return,"I ordered the the wipers and they were shipped to me on Jan 7. 2010. They were delivered on Jan 14 2010. I installed them on my truck on Jan 29, 2010. I washed my truck today and noticed the rubber had already seperated from the wiper. When I checked I am out of the time frame to return them for replacement. Save your money and go buy a cheap set. They would last longer than these wipers do."
2,Does not work on 2002 Nissan Maxima either,"I decided to try this out because Consumer report says that this is the best. To my surprise, the plastic assy cannot possibly fit into my ""hook"" assy (windshield hardware side). This is a terrible design flaw.Needless to say, I have to return this."
3,Not a fit for Sienna'06,The provided adapters can not fit on the Toyota Sienna'06 arms. Not possible to use the adapters from the original wipers to put on the Valeo wipers either. I ended up removing the rubber inserts from Valeo and putting them on the original wipers.The rubber quality seems fine so far.
1,Junk,"Worst wiper blades I've ever bought. Consumer Reports lead me wrong! Replacing after only a couple of months of use. Bad streaking, incomplete wiping."
5,"You say Valeo, I say value.","It had been a couple years since I replaced the blades on my Saturn... Not a huge deal living in southern California, but eventually it got pretty noticeable. These blades already had some pretty decent reviews, so I figured I would give them a shot. They installed easily, and work great! I have had them for a few months now, through some rainy winter months, and I have been pleased with how well they have held up thus far. I haven't owned them long enough to comment on longevity, but for the price, who cares?"
4,Its a wiper?,I bought this brand based on the rankings in consumer reports and the reviews here. Cost much less than previous wipers. In light rain it does skip a little which is annoying.
1,Really!!!,"1 star for cannot replacing my old wiper with this one. I bought this a while back, carefully selected for my Honda Accord 2008, but never get a chance to replace it until now and guess what, the area where you attach this wiper to the wiper arm on your car is to narrow. I cannot return because the return time frame is expired.So if you own a Honda Accord 2008, be-warned!!!Bummer!!!"
5,Doing great so far,"These blades are doing really great so far, about a month in and still whisper quiet. They do make sure you see the valeo in bright white pointed at you on the blades."
5,I Can See Again,It is always good to see where you are going when you are driving. No squeaking is also a big plus.You can pay more but I do not think you can buy a better product. The secret is to change wiper blades fairly often.
1,Absolute crap,Hard to install and once installed makes such poor contact with the windshield as to be worthless. Valeo cheaper and works !
3,Mr. Luis,I can not rate this item. I did not have time to have them install.I will try to have them install soon.
5,Their voices ase truly a gift.,My parents had an album of theirs when I was younger. I always loved the way the way the bible stories came alive for me. It is such a delight now to share the same songs with my children. Thank you!
1,Product Never Showed Up,I ordered a bag of espresso grains to supplement an espresso machine that I bought my parents for their birthday. It has been three weeks and the order product still has not arrived. They have an espresso machine and no espresso. Thanks.
2,SKOKIE,"After looking forward sometime to viewing this film, I am sad to report that the film is far too fragmented. What could have been a very thought provoking movie, turned out to be a failure.The acting was very wooden in parts, only Kaye rose above the average school of players.The subject matter could have been alot more hard hitting, for if this was based on fact, it was far to limp."
2,What are the pictures all about???,"I would definately say to borrow this one from the Library instead of buying it. I love this topic, and have read everything I can get my hands on about ghosts and the paranormal. I have to say this one did not impress me. The stories were weak at best, and my main gripe is the pictures! The pictures are intended to show some sort of paranormal activity, but all you really see is either nothing, a big cloud of mist or smoke (which is not distinguishable from fog or cigarette smoke), or orbs, orbs, and more orbs. Which may or may not be dust, considering they are snapping pictures in dirty old abandoned buildings most of the time. I am sure the author is a very talented ghost hunter, but she should stick to hunting, and not writing books. To summarize, the book was lacking any real substance, filled with useless pictures, and at times very unbelievable and anti climatic."
2,travel bingo,"I ordered this travel bingo to take on camping trips. It's a fun, BUT, the box and ball holder is Huge.It is not a good size for travel. It's just too big. I was disappointed. The whole thing could havebeen made smaller. Other than that, we do have fun playing."
1,Extreme Bullcrud,"Man, have you ever played something so pathetic?! This game has some of the worst graghics I have ever seen and the whole idea for the game is completely stupid! I would definently rank this worthless piece of garbage up there with Extreme Paintbrawl as the worst games of all-time. If you ever somehow get a hold of this, use the CD-ROM as a coaster or better yet smash it with a sledgehammer several times and burn up whats left of it to spare any other gamer who might stumble upon it and unfortunatly play it..."
5,Phenomenal Houston Drummer,"Sebastian Whittaker grew up in Houston and is known as an amazing professional jazz drummer. This CD is a set of pieces composed by different jazz artists, some of which live in Houston. Searching for the Truth represents a journey that every one of us have to take in order to find ourselves and that is what Sebastian Whittaker does."
5,Muito bem!,"One of my all time favorites! I don't even have kids, and I listen to it all the time. The best of gorgeous, lilting Brasilian folk songs that will keep grown ups as happy as the kids. Makes a great gift."
3,subjective at best,This book is very readable and informative but leaves out lots of information that I would have found critical. More details about her life in New Mexico would have been relavant. Ms. Robinson draws many conclusions that make Ms. O'keeffe sound like a total bitch after Alfred died. What's that about?I would suggest the first half but the end of the book is rather lame.
5,Harley Duffle Bag,"Great Bag. A birthday gift he's going to love. It's going to look great on the back of the bike too.Fast Shipping and good value, Thanks so much"
4,It seems quite safe,"I haven't been able to test very much of what this safe claims to offer, although I'll base my review on the ones I have been able to.Pros:- It was easy to program in the code- Heavy, so it would be difficult for someone to carry away discretely- A key in case you forget the code and lock yourself out- Handy hooks and a paper slot on the inside of the doorThe only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the price. I wished I would have shopped around to see if there was something less expensive that fit my needs."
4,Size DOES matter!!!,"I did lots of research prior to purchasing this product and I must admit I think I did pretty good. This product works well, it was easy to program and easy to use. What really surprised me was the delivery. I ordered it late Saturday evening and it was at my door Tuesday morning. The overall size of the safe is large, yet there is little room on the inside. I wanted a safe that I would be able to fit my smaller safe in, didn't work out that way. If you plan to use the safe to store documents and small valuables, this is the one. If you plan on storing medium sized object (i.e a hard drive, multiple handguns, etc) look elsewhere. Lots to offer on the outside, little space on the inside. Overall, I'm happy with it."
1,Horrible product,"I bought this product and I hated it, it was very flimsy and made of plastic,and the door doesn't even locked, I returned it in a heart beat, I don't reccomend this product at all."
1,Bad digital lock. Useless!,"I bought 1.3 cubic ft safe (First Alert fire safe with digital lock) from Amazon. Once opened the box and installed the 4 AA batteries, it turned out the digital lock was not working. Tried all the ways from user manual and still not functioning. I am returning it to Amazon. If you plan to buy a safe, help yourself by avoiding this item. It is no point to waste $219 on a 100lb cube that not serves as a safe. Meanwile, I have to spend a whole evening to try the lock, pack it back to the box and move it to the door way for UPS pickup; it is the worst buying experience ever!"
3,"Arrived damaged, amazon sent a replacement, swapped out the damaged product and new safe was fine.","Arrived damaged, amazon sent a replacement, swapped out the damaged product and new safe was fine. Be sure to check the product before the delivery guy leaves. The safe itself is what you would expect for the money. Hard metal on outside, cheap plastic on inside. I had a little trouble programming the code but the bypass key worked fine. Nice room on inside. I am happy with the purchase overall."
3,Recieved non-functional,The safe arrived promptly and well packaged however when I opened it up the setting trigger mechanisum was not present and the function of putting in my code would not work. Now I have not had a chance to contact First Alert due to an excessive travel requirement from work so I do not know how they would respond.There very well could be a simple fix to this issue that is not defined in the instructions.The safe was exactly as discribed and looks great and we are able to utilize it using the secondary entrance function of using the key to open the door. If I get a clarification of the issue from First Alert I will gladly send that information along also.
5,Godsend,"We moved from Indiana to Florida, and when we found out how much it cost to insure our valuables due to statewide crime, we could not believe it. We did get a home security alarm, but I had picked out this safe also. The rep from the company went back to his office and and checked on the safe. He called and said that it was a very good buy. Ergo, I bought it."
5,Husband loves it - sucker for soft tees,"Super soft snug fit, true to size, washes great. Micro modal pants are just as awesome (bought both as pjs)."
1,Not sure why people like it,I am a librarian. We have this book in our collection only because it was given to us for free. Its irreverant and non-standard style makes it nearly impossible to read. I don't know how anyone could give it five stars.
5,Bravo!,I really enjoyed this book. I sat down and read it all the way through in my first setting. It was a common sense approach to happiness. Can't wait for the next book.
1,Magick Botanicals hair spray,"The spray nozzle does not have a nice even spray to it, it comes out in a hard line spray. The hold is not very good either for my fine hair."
1,Fragance Free Hair Spray,"I received the hair spray in a timely manner. However, the spray pump doesn't work. It doesn't spray like hair spray, it just kind of spritzes and the spray just drips when you spray. I wouldn't buy it again, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,This book is full of inconsistency and inaccuracy,"I am very disappointed after finishing this book. At first, the book had a few minor mistakes which could be clarified from other sources. As I approach to the end of the book, it was not worth my time to use this book as my primary study guide. The way it was written was terribly messy. Examples and figures just were confusing (check out Figure 9-6/Example 9-1). BGP is already a hard topic to grasp, but this book really help you to be TOTALLY CONFUSED. Some test questions on the CD had questions that you really can't find an answer for in the book. This is my first review ever on any book and regret it had to be a bad review. I am very disappointed by it as the usually reliable Cisco Press had given me such a bad experience. I urge anyone who's planning to use this book for the exam to think twice before purchasing this book."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"You would think anything Cisco attach's their name to should be first rate. Unfortunately, that doesn't hold true for this book. I have to agree with the others that the language and diagrams were far too difficult to understand to be of any use. I plan on using another study guide, along with Routersim software to pass the exam."
5,Flawless Victory,"With no footnotes, no jargon, no namedropping and (almost) no mathmatics, this book clears all the conceptual underbrush away from the foundations of the social and behavioral sciences. Reading it was like watching an intellectual kung fu master in a rapid-fire series of celebrity deathmatches. As soon as Elster has dispatched Milton Friedman (Whup-POW!), he moves on to Steven Jay Gould. He chops ideas up into neat 10-page sections, says what he has to say, then cracks his knuckles and moves on. He does this so effortlessly that I found myself scratching my head (""how did I not see this before?"") at the end of each section. It's not exactly fun - the reading can be dense - but it can be thrilling to simply feel the dust and cobwebs shoot out of your ears. I learned more in 500 pages than in 6 years of undergraduate survey courses. Highly, highly recommended."
3,La Ciudad Review,"La Cuidad was a good movie that helps show what some immigrants have to indure. The movie takes place in an urban setting in New York. It gives four sepaerate tales of four Latin immigrants with all of them having a connection because they all eventually visit the same photgrapher. The movie is pictured in black and white which adds to the effect it has on the viewers. The tales work to show the mistreatment of immigrants here in America. In the movie, immigrants were being cheated out of their pay, children were refused by schools and more. The movie is well constructed and gives a real view of how hard being an immigrant can be.In one section, the film portrays dozens of male immigrants on a New York corner ready to work for anyone who came. I do reccommend this film especially to those who are interested or working with the subject of immigrants."
4,Good Movie Playback,"I have had this card for 9 months. I have not had any problems except with the DVD player supplied by ATI. It would freeze everything up. I now use Power DVD. The display is excellent for video, alright for gaming. The 2D is expectional and I will never play a game on it anyways. After 5 months I updated the driver and the display improved. It takes some effort to navigate their website to find though. The video output to my television has some artifacts/moition. ... Overall, for 2D viewing."
2,This card stinks!,This card is one of the worst videocards I've ever owned. It's slow with a average picture also the DVD play back stinks. I had a 16MB Vanta that came with my computer that had the a better picture and ran faster. Altought on the up side the features are not to bad.
4,It works ok,I have used this for my t-shirt cannon and it worked OK. First time I used it I had to disassemble it and put it back together because it was leaking (air) but after that it worked well holding 70 psi with no problem.
5,A very interesting mystery,"This book kept me guessing, what the woman and her captor were going to do next. One minute I think they are going to fall in love and live happily every after then the next they are at each others throats. Nancy thinks he some sort of homicidal raptist and he thinks she's the most beautiful creature to walk this earth and doesn't want to harm her in anyway. They are both experiencing something they have both longed for; love and affection of another human being. I must admit this was great suspense and kept me guessing what would happen next. Just to let you know I read this book in one night because I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read more of Michael Garrett. He's at the top of my list of authors to read."
5,brilliant work,"As weird as it may sound - a duo of Viola and Drums - it makes a perfectly beautiful sound. Just recieved my copy yesterday and it's great, I love the first track so beautiful and EXPLOSIVE. It's quite similar to some of A silver Mount zion works, bar the guitar of course. Try it, you won't be disappointed!PS : and try to buy it from independent sources - or even better : direct :D"
2,Can only comment on the first third of the book...,"To my mind, the author was trying to prove two things:a) that he is smarter than Kurt Godel, and anyone else who has thought about the problem, andb) that the correct answer to Platonism vs Fictionalism is ""who knows or cares?""I was unconvinced by the former and underwhelmed by the latter. On internalising the latter, I was unable to finish the book. Perhaps the rest is better, or perhaps I was expecting something else. Or perhaps, being not even as smart as Godel, I am just not clever enough. Who knows, who cares?"
2,"The only word that comes to mind is ""disappointment""","This is one of the first books that have left me dazed. Lennon's writing style is easy to follow, but the 'bits & pieces' which make up the story are chosen rather randomly. Though i loved the idea of the tragic ""plane falling from the sky"" and enjoyed the beginning of the book, i felt that Lennon has left out a whole chunk of his story unexplained. Also, Lennon only concentrated on the lives of one or two characters in the story, and not all of them, which made me wonder why he introduced the other characters into the story in the first place. My final words were: What was the whole point of that? -Perhaps this just isn't my type of book.."
4,Looking for relationship,"I read this book over a weekend, propelled on by consistently interesting writing but ultimately disappointed by characterizations that remained thin. Perhaps the problem came from weaving a storyline around too many disparate characters. Nevertheless, the sense of quiet desperation, inchoate longing, fitful struggle and minor revelations had the feel of real life."
1,Good premise falls apart on runway...1000's disappointed,"You know a novel isn't very good when you find yourself rewriting it in your head as you're reading it. I'm not talking about changing a word here and there, but the basic structure of the entire novel. (Don't you think it would have been more interesting if the true story of how Bernardo came to be in Montana was kept from the reader until later?) I also thought the writing was very amateurish (certain metaphors were outright laughable) and the symbolism heavy-handed and, ultimately, pointless. I really wanted to like this book; I overlooked the bad writing in hopes that the story would really touch me. But the closer I got to the (disappointing) ending, the more I just wanted to get it over with. I found myself wondering, How could a book so incomplete and obviously lacking get such good reviews? This is the last time I buy ""blind."""
1,read a review before you buy,"I was highly disappointed in Lennon's novel. I found it disappointing, lacking in narrative and down-right boring. The characters he uses have no depth, no ending and no real beginning. I thought the novel had a real chance at the beginning and was disappointed when it ended just like any of his other chapters. I can understand wanting the readers mind to wonder, but the only thing I was wondering was the whole point to the novel. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Something is missing...,"I like the idea of writing about people who have left behind the plane crash---how it affects people who somehow involved. There are several main characters in this story, and I was expecting something would happen to connect all (or at least some) of them, but nothing really happened. Even after finishing the book, I still feel like ""unfinished."""
1,Skip this one,"I kept forcing myself through this book to try to discover the point...there isn't one. It's a rambling tale of a bunch of losers caught up in inertia...and I'm afraid that the same inertia kept me going. Also, I didn't have a good cereal box to read instead. The characters have all totally ceded control of their lives, but the dialog and narration would have you believe that they are taking control. As my father-in-law would say, ""S--- or get off the pot!"" Lennon thanks people for their contribution to his material on the Indians and plane crash investigation...yet the book contains no detail on either of these that displays as much knowledge as a casual TV viewer might have. There is simply no substance or point to this book. Save the trees, please."
3,"Interesting, but over hyped.","I admire the Anticon camp for their experimentation. The Clouddead and new Themselves releases were my two favorites from the crew. After reading some rave reviews of the new Sole, I picked it up. While I admire Sole's honesty and vulnerabilty, (and much of the album's production is good too), all-in-all I'm not really feeling Sole's mic skills. It's just hard to listen to an album full of raps that don't rhyme. It's cool if you're influenced by spoken word, or if you're just into rule-breaking....but man, at least drop a few tracks that rhyme. Maybe he should write a book of poetry instead. It's a good record if you're looking for something really different, and somewhat original, but it's nowhere near a 5-star album IMHO."
5,Unique View of the War,"This book is going to take me four years to read and I can't wait. Instead of a typical history book where you read about numerous events arranged as the author intended to emphasize his thesis, this book meters out the history in real time, exactly 150 years later. I bought this book as a replacement for the one I lost and used 25 years ago, when it was the 125th anniversary of the events. I was working on a job where we started each morning with readings from the book of events that had unfolded exactly 125 years before on that very date. Doing that was sort of like the next best thing to having lived it, the metering of the events in time seemed to make them more important, more meaningful, more patriotic.Now I'll be doing it again, only this time 150 years after the fact."
1,sorry of the sorry!,"The most sorry of films that we have been enticed by its highly advertised hype for entertainment. This film does not deserve the time, expense and effort to bury it at a local land fillWhich Way Is Up?A.Radke"
3,Movie,This item was purchased as a gift so I have no opinion about the quality but it did arrive pretty quick.
5,That negro's awesome!,"The late great Richard Pryor delivers a usual awesome performance in the 1977 comedy about a troubled man regarding sex and politics. Not only that,he plays multiple roles,as substantiated by the cover photo. I remember seeing this movie when I had Wometco Home Theatre in the late 70's. Years later,I caught this movie on Comedy Central,with the profanities muted,of course. I dedicate this film,with his others,to the memory of Peoria,Illinois-born Pryor(December 1,1940-December 10,2005)."
2,UGGly Experience,"I bought these boots because I wanted something that would keep my feet warm and dry throughout the unpredictable and (often harsh) winters in NYC. I purchased the pair this past November and wore them three times. The first two times were during heavy rain, and they performed beautifully in terms of keeping my feet dry, although I noticed that the sheepskin lining on the insole was already wearing out. The third time I wore these was yesterday during heavy snow/rain/sleet. The experience was disastrous. The boots are not made to withstand blizzard-like conditions! My feet were cold and wet. The exterior had several dark spots where the water had seeped through and it took several hours for the boots to completely dry out. I wear orthopaedic foot beds under the insoles of my boots and shoes. The water inside the boots destroyed my footbeds!!! These are going right back to UGG for an exchange (different product altogether)."
4,A very interesting book,"I've read the reviews posted here previously, and agree with much of what has been said. But the comments of some reviewers are puzzling. You're right -- this book is not ""great literature"". But then, it wasn't meant to be. This is an insightful novel, nicely written, by an author who knows the world of TV news and has some interesting things to say about it. I found the characters to be believable, the situations engaging, the dialogue realistic, and the humour bang-on. This is, I believe, Mr. MacNeil's third novel, and I look forward to reading many more from him in the future."
3,It was alright,"When Lucinda's wealthy and powerful father dies, she inherits the Isla del Oro, a small island off the coast of California, where everything is as it was when her grandfather first discovered it a century before. Lucinda is now the wealthiest girl in the world -- but her guardian forbids her to leave the island, and strange things begin to happen to Lucinda, until she begins to think someone is trying to kill her. But who? Her mysterious guardian? Her handsome fiance? Or the island doctor?The inheritance of her father's vast fortune and contact with a variety of people with suspicious motives trigger a series of attempts on Lucinda's life in her isolated island home, which is a stronghold of Spain within the boundaries of the United States."
1,Clearly hasn't read Dewey,"Edmondson clearly hasn't read Dewey or taken the time to understand the history of American education. If he had, he'd realize that Dewey's ideas haven't been taken up into American schooling, as traditionalists won the schooling battles of the early to mid 1900s. This text is essentially a polemic against liberal/progressive thought, using Dewey as his straw man."
4,Elegantly evokes the quixotic nature of Mexico's underside,"Lida does a masterful job of providing a window into those aspects of Mexican society not seen in tourist propaganda and sanitized resort zones. Dark and revealing and, quite often, disturbing and unsettling, these stories nevertheless effectively capture the widespread desperation that blooms from extraordinary poverty, the clash of the animist vs. the Christian aspects of society at large, and the seemingly inescapable clash of humility vs. the congenital aggressiveness born of the national inferiority complex's that seem to be fostered in third world societies.One can only hope that at some point Lida will aim his attention and efforts at capturing the whimsy, familial devotion and racial and cultural pride that also color Mexican society. One can imagine that would be equally insightful an effort as well as a much more pleasant reading experience."
3,Jeep Grand Cherokee,"I bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee in 05 with 65,xxx miles on it. Other than routine maintenance, I just switched out the alternator. I've been through 3 serp belts, no idea why. CD player is crapping out on me. Front two speakers are going out.Cooling fan went out at 89,xxx. At 126,xxx, I need a new relay switch, A/C light won't come on unless the defrosters are on. Alignment keeps going out. Rear axle keeps leaking. Fuel pump is starting to go out.All not major problems but when they add up it gets annoying.My favorite part is that the car leaks water every time it rains. The weather stripping is fine except for around the sunroof.No mechanic I know can figure out why it does."
2,Good Information but bad glue job,"If you use the book in normal garage condition 5 or 6 time, pages are getting loose.The information / instructions are good, although I would have liked a little bit more info on parts that wear often ( bushings sizes / rod sizes )"
1,Less than a year and it is gone!,"Just wanted to add my two cents here. I have never been more disappointed in a product. I purchased one and had to return it on the same day. The disk tray got stuck and wouldn't open or play. I returned it right away and have had the ""new"" one for less than a year. Attempted to record several programs recently (I don't use it daily) and it appears to be recording but doesn't record ANYTHING! The disk tray only operates intermittently so don't put a disk in if you don't want to run the risk of losing or damaging it.Cyberhome's website is up for sale so I am assuming now that they have gone under. That means you will get no tech support on this product! I don't remember what I paid for it now...probably around $100 but after reading some of the other reviews I think it is a sham of a product - never intended to really operate for any length of time."
3,Not bad for the price,I received this recorder as a birthday gift last March. It was working great until about September when the eject froze and the machine was very sluggish if it was working at all. I took it to a repair shop in December and the guy said it was a quality machine with crappy parts. So he replaced the parts and I haven't had a problem since. For the cheep price I think it was worth the little bit of hassle that it has caused. A good first recorder to practice on and see if you really will use it as much as you think you will.
1,"garbage, avoid like the a bad disease","This is crap, I bought it used it for 8 months and then it died. I tried to email tech support and they never responded.So I bought a new one. I wrote this one off."
1,Timer recording if it feels like it.,"I've had one of these for a month and finally returned it. I bought it to replace my VCR for recording shows when I'm gone. The problem with this thing is it's random if it will record or not. one week it skipped, the next it got 2 of 3 timers, the next it did one of the 3 timers etc. these are an unchangeing weekly timer. This is one of the main functions it was designed for, and it fails at it. Spend a little more money, and get a better name brand."
1,piece of junk,i bought this machine it said it would read vcd's and svcd's jpg's and mp3's only on dvd blanks it would not read any iof the pre recordered cd-r's or cd-rw's i tryed every brand dont waste your money.
1,No stars if permitted,"first make sure you have a TV with rca or s-video inputs else you will need an rf-modulator to connect to an older style tv. you will not see this on the box, but is on the instruction sheet inside.After making connections, turning on for 1st time should have invoked set-up. It didn't. Tried to use the remote for setup - no response. Batteries with unit were dead. Put in new batteries, the only function working on the remote was to turn the unit on and off. Nothing else. Packed up everything and returned for refund."
1,Cyberhome 1530 Avoid this one,"DVD tray locks up, no release, customer service very poor,unresponsive to emails, warranty returns? You pay shipping, video display fades in and out, finally returned mine for store credit. I would not recommend this if it were under $100. Had they made an effort to assist I might feel better."
2,Problems,"I bought this DVD Recorder about a week ago. You can't beat the price, which is the lowest I've seen, but I have problems with the sound going out when I try to do a timed recording, and at various other times for no obvious reason. I'm going to return it and try another brand. Even when the sound is working, it moves very slowly through the menus, takes up to 10-15 minutes to finalize a DVD-R disk, and often has long waiting periods when you do a simple function, like press ""stop."""
1,Complete Garbage,"DO NOT BUY CYBERHOME!I received the DVR-2500 Recorder for Christmas last year. I have used it seldomly for playing movies, and barely at all for recording DVDs. 6 months later, the unit is dead. Won't turn on, won't light up, nothing. In fact, the only thing doing less than this piece of junk recorder, is Cyberhome's customer service. No response whatsoever! LOOK AT THE OTHER REVIEWS. THIS COMPANY IS A JOKE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,This item is fixable!,"My unit wouldn't burn a dvd or play one, or even go into setup.I opened the box by taking out the screws and lifting the cover from the back first then got it off. Then I placed a paper between the battery clip and the battery, leaving it there for an hour, till the unit was dead, no battery. Then removed the paper, put the cover back on and it was just like it came from new. The people that do the movies have a way of screwing it up while it is burning a movie( actually stops it burning I think). It has a read only memory that is programmable. So removing the battery resets everything to factory. Now I need to finalize my 179 movies so I can put on the updated software from cyberhome.com Go there, then look for downloads and print the instructions and download thr 2 files for update. Make sure the serial number on the machine is before the X. check instructions. Like a new one, not perfect but works!!!"
1,Avoid the DVR 1500 from Cyberhome!!!,"My unit died at 4 months of use, just beyond the 90 day warranty. the internal DVD burner drive basically stopped working, or it burnt out. the unit gets hot, and the housing design basically does not allow for the heat to escape. Cyberhome customer support is awful. they do not answer emails, or pick up the phone when you call in for a Return Merchandise Number.... they will charge you another $90 to replace your unit. its true what they say, you get what you pay for.... avoid this too good to be true deal!"
1,BUYER BEWARE,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT 6 MONTHS AGO AND IT WAS GREAT. NOW IT IS UNRESPONSIVE. WILL NOT READ DISCS. TRAY WILL NOT OPEN. WILL NOT TURN OFF..MUST UNPLUG. TAKES 15 MIN TO TELL ME THAT THERE IS NO DISC. CYBERHOME CUSTOMER SERVICE IS POOR. NO RESPONSE FROM EMAIL AND WHEN CALLING IT IS OVER A 20 MINUTE WAIT. PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!
1,You lose money and time,"After setting up my first recorder I realized that the tray does not open. A part inside was bent and stopped the tray at the front panel! If you have not believed it yet: they do not have any quality control. The second unit was a challenge. It just did what ever it wanted to. I'm a computer freak and know a lot about electronics, but this one will drive you crazy.Finally it refuses to respond to any button.If only the support at Cyberhome would respond to your questions. The only thing I can think of is they are overwhelmed with unsatisfied customers and cannot handle all the issues reported to them. If you decide to buy: Good Luck! You will need it. Cyberhome will get two things from you: your money and your error reports."
1,bad bad bad,Not even worth one star ... No customer service..Have shipped to cyberhome via rma each taking 10 days to return and each time I get it back it does not work.... They say they can repair or replace and it does not have to be new...SO what I am getting is someone elses problems...for 299.00 for 2 months use and now after 3 weeks and 3 returns still nothing....Cannot get through on phone line they say they will just put you into voicemail but don't even try everything is full on their voice mail..I think it is time to go to court...Oh and I purchased this from HSN and they said they cannot help as it has been over 30 days...enough said for helping their customers.
2,Confusing and TOO comprehensive,"It is possible to create a trust (living or otherwise) that does not do what you expect it to do. If you want to direct how the trustees handle the trust's assets after you are gone, and how much income specific beneficiaries will obtain from the trust, or create a complex trust, this may be the book you want.If all you want is a living trust that will allow your assets to escape probate, and maximize the estate tax deductions, then forget this book. Read ""the Living Trust"" by Abts instead"
2,"Good idea, poor quality","Elite Beats is a fun game overall but with many flaws. I've found that the ""life-line"" you have while playing a song is extremely short and can run out with no real reason. For example, I've been stuck on one song for the past few days and even though I haven't missed a single note my life line runs out at the same place every time. The idea behind the game is genius but as for the game itself...it can become severely frustrating when, no matter how well you do, you're always going to fail. I think I would love this game if it was more well done without its glitches. Overall, I would not recommend this game because there doesn't appear to be any science to your placement on the lifeline--even if you get the notes, your life might still end up decreasing."
3,Too Soon,"Despite how fun the game is, it was way too short for my liking. I was surprised to find myself at what looked like the final level after about two hours of playing. I guess my little gripe about the length of the game isn't all too common a complaint since I'm assuming other people squeeze more hours out of the game by playing on more difficulties and trying to get the highest possible scores.That being said, it's still a decent steal for 10 dollars (new)."
5,Agents are... GO!!!,"Elite Beat Agents is the most looked-over hit DS game! This game, which I got for about $10, is awesome! Elite Beat Agent's target tapping, rhythm gameplay is very addicting and challenging. Before I wrote this review, I looked at the 2 star reviews, and I actually sort-of agree with them. This game is a great value for what it is, but Ouendan 2 (Japanese EBA) is much better. So, if you are a Ouendan player, I encourage you to be open-minded while playing. Overall, this is a great value!"
4,Hard to Beat these Agents,"I bought this game after hearing about it on someone's podcast. I was surprised by the quirky nature of the game. It is a music rhythm game where the Elite Beat Agents are called upon to save people's problems by singing, and dancing. The idea is absurd but by using a stylus you touch or drag along the lower screen to keep the agents moving in sync with the music. If done correctly, the Agents manage to save another crisis and are ready for the next assignment. This game is best enjoyed using headphones and the rumble pack available separately. They are not necessary but add to the enjoyment. After a while, the music begins to get a hold of you and you will want to save the rest of the world using music.I highly recommend this game for anyone with a sense of humor."
5,Very very addictive,"What can I say...Everyone's given this game a perfect score and there's a reason for that.This game is incredibly fun!It is simple to pick up yet very challenging.It has entertaining and creatively done comic cut scenes.It has a diverse selection of songs that will at least give eveyone a favorite.Because of these factors, there's no reason to play this game just once.Definitely a keeper!So when you're down or having a bad day... don't hesitate to let the Elite Beat Agents brighten up your day (as they do in the story)."
4,Generation X-treme Sports,"From the outset of this album sounds like the soundtrack to every BMX video you've ever seen. The contrast between slow, melodic patterns and the harsher energy release of a classic angst ridden emo band is the perfect backdrop for this truly great album. Although this album reaches it's peak at the second track with the towering ""Irish Car Bomb"" every track is on it's own as a work of art. If you like the Promise Ring, The Get Up Kids, or in fact any emo band, this would be a valuable addition to your collection. Keep on riding kids."
4,Awesome but the end of an ERA for a reason!,"The dvd rules, korn has been one of my favorites since 1997 when I got Life Is Peachy. I saw them several times with the original line up and nothing will ever top that. Regardless who they have help them live anymore. But in 2004 Head and Fieldy were burnt out from drugs and Korn were showing signs of burning out as well.Korn still rules in my opinion, but this is not there best. Buying this is for the ""Head and David"" factor. In the show you see a few mess ups by the band, that during there best they wouldnt of done. Fieldy looks tired and and out of energy the whole time. JD is awesome, but his voice isnt as strong as it is now, IMO.For the price it is worth it for any true Korn fan. I did enjoy watching the set with all of the 5 of them like back in the day. I think that Korn has improved since Head and David left for the right reasons and continue to rock and rule."
3,Not impressed.,"Like all vitamin supplements, you won't see the benefits unless you've used it a while. And the benefits are so-so compared to the oil of oregano liquid that you mix with water. Capsules are too big too. Going back to the oil of oregano."
3,good but...,"I really liked this product but after a little use I noticed I was getting grumpy when I took it. So I checked the ingredients closer and found that the one ingredients was berries from the sumac plant and acted like cashews so if you have a nut allergy you shouldn't take it. Maybe this wouldn't bother someone else but it certainly did me. Fortunately I don't have a severe reaction to nuts, but it certainly was noticeable. Otherwise this is a wonderful product!"
1,Dissapointing,"This was a very dissapointing purchase. The graphics are horrible. I don't know how old this game is, but it was a waste of money."
5,Great phrase book,This is a great little reference book if interested in learning Thai. Using some kind of on line or person audio assistance is necessary since Thai is tonal.
5,Billy Bunny's Sticker Book,"This is a beautifully illustrated book that appeals to children of all ages. I recommend it highly. It has a vast array of nature stickers that are bright and realitic. They teach the children the names of things in nature and have smart ways of getting the children to understand color matching and counting. Children as small as 1 1/2 can enjoy this book. My 19 month old daughter loved it, but it's sopisticated enough for older children. I'm buying my second! In addition there is a VERY generous amount of REUSABLE stickers. Any mother can tell you how expensive they are. This book provided my daughter with days of entertainment and education. For the content and money it's five stars."
3,Yikes!!!,"This film is a real train wreck. You can't take your eyes off of it, and you're ashamed that you cant. It reflects and magnifies todays life in America...the tabloid culture. Keifer Sutherland and Reese Witherspoon are repugnantly fascinating.If you want to see something disturbingy different, I would recommend it, but don't expect to get anything ot of it, but maybe a few bad dreams."
5,One of the all-time best,"Scathing, hilarious black comedy that should have a wide cult following! Reese Witherspoon is amazing as a white trash street fighter who is stalked by an educated suburban sicko, and she is supported by an excellent cast that includes a nasty Brooke Shields (who dies a gruesome death) and many others."
1,This movie was horrible,"This movie was supposed to be scary. It was just stupid. If you're a Reese Witherspoon fan like me, this movie will disappoint you. Rent a different Reese movie. I recomment Election."
1,Not happy,"DVD did not work, I know it is USA region and not UK, but you did know where you are sending it...."
5,Reese's Tour De Force,"Reese Witherspoon steals every scene with her sensational performance as a troubled teenager who gets picked up by a serial killing maniac, she proceeds to turn the tables on her protagonist and leaves him for dead only to find out that he didn't die and now wants revenge on her and her family. I have watched most of Reese's movies and i think she is a fine actress but this performance should have garnered her an academy award, she is mesmerizing, unforgettable and flat out fantastic in this her finest hour as an actress."
4,Hell hath no fury like Reese Witherspoon,"Set along the premise of the ""Red Riding Hood"" storyline, 'Freeway' is the twisted tale of a young, reckless high school age girl and her escape from the epitome of a dysfunctional family. She sets her escape to the safety of ""Grandmother's house"" after fleeing from the clutches of state custody. Kiefer Sutherland comes along as the ""caring rebound"" from her dilemma, portraying a helpful child psychologist who has all the answers to her problems. This is where the film takes a turn to the bizarre and demented.Skeptical of Reese Witherspoon's starring role? Thinking `Legally Blonde'? Well put those assumptions to rest because this chick is not the one to screw over. Brooke Shields plays the arrogant, nave and doomed wife of Sutherland's character who more than folds under the pressure of the film's outcome. Definite rent/purchase of people wanting to view an hour and a half head trip, highly recommended and very entertaining.peace."
1,empty box,"There's nothing to review.The envelope seeems to have been opened, somewhere along the transport way, the DVD-box slit open and the DVD removed.So, there's nothing to review."
2,Please don't buy this! Save your money.,"I don't care who your coaches are. I don't want to see pictures of you and random fighters. I don't want to read about your experiences. I don't want to read about why some fighters want to visit Thailand or where Thailand is on a map. I want to learn Muay Thai techniques. There was nothing advanced about the book. There was very little meat. You can learn more by ""googling"" muay thai techniques. This book was really bad."
4,My kids loved this weird book!,"This is really a very strange and kooky book, and my kids loved it. They ask me to read it again and again. It is a little spooky for 2 to 3 year olds."
3,"A quick read, an interesting transfomation","""The Chocolate Touch"" is an update of the story of Midas with a generational switch thrown in to engage children's emotions. The progression of John Midas's ""chocolatitis"" from a wonderful to a terrible thing is well done, and his unintentional alienation of his best friend will be something that most children can sympathize with. My eight-year-old devoured this book in a single short sitting, and I'm sure he would award it five stars. A pleasurable light summer read for a child; not a lot of depth or development."
4,READ IT!,"The Chocolate Touch, by Patrick Catling is a very EXITING BOOK to read.John Midas is the main charecter.He usaully loves chocolate and he can't get enough,but when the chocolate touch kicks into action he needs to get rid of it!My favorite part is when the chocolate touch starts!If you want everything to turn to chocolate you might change your mind.So if you see the Chocolate Touch GRAB IT! BUY IT!AND READ IT!"
3,A Yummy Book,"I liked The Chocolate Touch because it is mysterious and makes you think! Every time you stop reading you feel like you need to read more! John Midas (the main character) loves chocolate. Susan Buttercup (John's best friend) is a girl who has blond curly hair, and is fun, nice and caring! John's family is very nice but concerned. But I warn you some parts were kinda boring but other than that it is a good book! I thought that this book relates to me because I love chocolate and my family is caring but concerned, too. I learned something and it is be careful what you wish for, it might become a disaster! I would recommend this book for someone who is willing to go on a huge adventure and have fun and it really does have a chocolatey touch![...]"
4,A Good Book for Beginning 4th Graders,"The characters in this story make me wonder why every thing tasted so much like chocolate. There are some hilarious parts in this book. John started having every thing taste like chocolate and he even bit into a silver dollar! This book reminds me of diary of a wimpy kid because there is a touch in each of them. my opinion on this book is that it is a good book for an accelerated reader in third grade. I recommend this book to kids who like to read a small short fast read book about chocolate.By Ethan S., 4th Grader"
4,What a yummy book!!!,"I read this book to my third graders each year and they absolutely love it. It is easy to read, follow that characters, and the plot of the story. It teaches many lessons on greed and appreciating this in small doses."
4,A great book for any age,"This book was an excellent book that you can read over and over again to your children. It's about boy who got what he asked for and then realized he didn't want it.It's a great illustration for the phrase ""Watch what you ask for you just might get it."""
5,Critique,"This book is an excellent introduction to the field of probability. It does not go into higher level mathematical theory, but presents the subject in easy to understand language and sticks to areas of practical application."
4,Was helpful,The book was written in a very reader-friendly language and featured easy to understand examples. It breaks each concept down into separate topics that are easy to navigate through if you're looking for a specific thing.
2,Good Info But Hard to Read,"This book has a lot of good information, but it is very terse in its explanation and, therefore, fairly difficult to read beyond the first few chapters. The main advantage of this book is that its cheap."
4,great,"How I Met Your Mother season 3 starts off a little slow, but really picks up quick. Season 3 puts HIMYM in the upper echelon of comedy shows on tv right now because it is maintaining a high level of excellence without faltering like other popular shows such as the Office."
3,"Good fun, with usual fairly predictable twists","First of all he downloadable player is just terrible. It is slow, buggy, and still as annoying as itunes. I suggest you stream it the videos if you can.The season is good fun. A few twists here and there, the usual silliness from the usual characters. If you liked season 2 you will like season 3. It is simple as that."
3,Not as Good as the Previous,"To put it very shortly, it's pretty good, but not as good as seasons 1 and 2. To put it lengthy, Ted starts to act a bit like Barney, but isn't anywhere near as funny about it or as good at it as Niel Patrick Harris. On the plus side, Marshal and Lily are still as enjoyable as ever, except that Lily's hair looks kinda funny. Robin is pretty much just typical Robin. Regardless, get it if you enjoy the show, just be warned that this season is most definitely not its strong point."
3,Disappointing,Well i really loved the first 2 seasons - rolling on the floor.I have only watched 13 episodes of season 3 so far. The first disc containing 6 episodes was absolute rubbish. The second disc was much better but below the standard set by the first 2 seasons which were consistently brilliant.Maybe it was the writers strike (the season is shorter than the others) I don't know. I will probably get season 4 but I really hope the last disc picks it up a bit.
3,Ride 2001,"I bought the album without hearing it because the sticker on the cover said ""Galaxy 500 meets Neil Young"". Unfortunately it's more like ""Ride goes country"". The lead singer sings in a fey emotionless voice for the whole of the album - it's a very nice voice but with no light and shade it become monotonous. The tunes are very pretty and there is some nice guitar moments but no bite. I'd love to hear them live since I think they would sound a little more alive. They are a universe away from being as good as Galaxy 500 were."
5,Understanding Hip Hop,"I didn't know any background, history of Hip Hop, Rap, and this book educated me.It was great to learn about it and its an important element in our culture.I recommend it highly. You don't have to be a philosophy student to read this book. It's for everyone.Sherri Rosen, New York City"
1,Is it a bow?,"Wait, I just brought this item understand that I just brought Recurve Bow, but from reading the review the order I am confused. Is it it a bow?"
1,Buyer beware .. this tank loses pressure,"I was very happy with this sturdy sprayer .. until it started to lose pressure from the plunger/handle. No matter how hard I (or my husband) tighten it down, there is a small hissing sound and the pressure drops rapidly. I made sure that the treads hadn't been stripped and then signed on to Amazon to request a return/refund .. but of course the time window for that had closed. I bought a very expensive piece of bright blue steel ... buyer beware."
5,An 18 month old stopper!,We own quite a few Elmo tapes and videos but this is the only one that my daughter actively seeks out and asks to watch or to listen to....again and again and again! And I don't mind at all! It's is a great video as well!
3,Solid Jams,"Although a fan of Tab's, this CD leaves me wanting. Don't get me wrong its a good listen a well worth purchasing for fans, but it doesn't grab me the way Nice and Warm and Standing on Banks do. If you are a fan and looking at buying it, you won't be disappointed, but if you're new to Tab you'd do better to get one of other CDs first."
2,tourist trap fire-side ghost tales,"Worth the price???. . . Not so much!the ""stories"" are very very short and have very little substance.the author is not even a ghost hunter. it's like the publisher's paid this guy to go all over the US w/ his wife and dig up popular folk lore."
5,funny!,"Loved this movie, I love the blond guy in it! If you like him too, hes also in the show ""party down"" on HBO!"
4,krautrock for the new millenium,"Fans of Faust, Can and Neu! should find this album a real treat. Repetetive, steady rhythms, and finely nuanced textures. A very enjoyable album. If you like Tortoise and other Chicago post-rock outfits, this should appeal to you."
2,Disapointing,"I don't know- this album disapointed me. ""Jelly Cream"" was such a fantastic album because not only was it exquisitely produced and performed, but the songs were truly great songs. The songs on ""Welcome"" are just not up to par in my opinion. I find them boring. The execution of the songs are of course top notch- I know of no finer singer/guitar player than Doyle, he kicks ... as usual- but it just doesn't cut it for me. One problem with great players is that they often get away with mediocre song writing. I think this album suffers in that way. ""Jelly Cream"" is a much superior album."
5,Bramhall's guitar playing ranks with the best,"Doyle Bramhall has made taken up where Cream, Stevie Ray and Buddy Guy left off. While certainly playing his own style, there are elements of all the greats present in this presentation. ""Blues that isn't afraid to rock"" is how I would label this album.Andrew Mueller's review for Amazon (above) mentions interminable guitar solos. The guy just doesn't get it. The guitar solos are magic. No, they won't fit into neat little 3 minute packages for radio play. This isn't mindless commercial music, it's artistry. If you love good guitar playing, you'll love this album."
1,Not a good dictionary,"I need to buy something for my husband who does not speak a word of Ukrainian. Looked at the firt page of this book and it was enough for me to know it's not good. The words are not the words regular Ukrainians speak with actually IN Ukraine. Those are the words that 2nd and 3rd generation Ukrainian immigrants from US and Canada use, and this author living in New York tries to pass them as authentic Ukrainian. Sure, you will be understood if you visit the country, but you will sound funny using those words."
2,Not useless!...entirely....,"As a source of many words, this is an okay book.My issues?The book provides tranlations of words, without context for their use, thereby requiring you to lookup the translated word. Many translation dictionaries make such mistakes, but what makes this so difficult with this book is that many of the words provided in one language, are NOT in the other language! Thereby effectivly making you GUESS as which word to use for any given situation."
2,"Many errors, I don't not recommend it.",I have several Ukrainian friends and they tell me that there are many errors in the book.
4,"Good book, but not what I was looking for","My kids are both under the age of three. Apparently this is earlier than the ""Early Years"" that Hall and Moats were addressing in the title. I wouldn't recommend this book for parents whose children were not yet in kindergarten. It is also aimed at parents of struggling readers. Other parents just looking to encourage and boost their children's education probably wouldn't find it helpful either. It is a thorough and well-researched book, just not what I was looking for."
1,Grass Whip,"This device is so blunt it is almost impossible to cut grass and weeds with it. I remember having one like this many years ago and it was great for whacking grass and weeds. This blade of this one has been dipped or sprayed with paint, probably to prevent rust, but this makes the edges blunt instead of sharp. There seems to be no way to sharpen the blade as it is corrugated."
4,"Good product, stopper had issues",This is a good quality of oregano oil. It is very potent and you can definitely feel it. I added it to a juice drink and it really spices it up. The problem I had was the stopper started to come apart after extended use and began to leak. These caused the strong smelling oil to leak into my cabinet and had to be cleaned up. I'm not a fan of liquid droppers for this reason.If you are looking for a much better price get this one:[...]
3,spicy stuff,"I used this product on my toe which had the start of a fungus. It did help somewhat but with daily applications I hope it will continue to take care of the problem. I have siatica also and I was putting 2 drops under my tongue but it was so very strong tasteing I stopped. I didn't add it to juice which is another option, perhaps I will try that soon. All in all I guess it is a good product but time will tell."
5,Long search ended,"My Dad, purchased this item 60 years ago, and I sold it at a garage sale 20 years ago because I did not need it anymore. Recently needed it again and could not locate it. Lucky to find it so I purchased it and my job was as easy as pie.If you need an easy way to put up fence posts, this is the tool."
5,Beautiful and functional piece of artwork,I love everything about the Baerreis Little Egypt from the lovely colour of wood to the fact that it holds my very thick hair up effortlessly. I wear my hair frequently in all variations of buns and this fork will work (and accent) all of them. My hair length is just below APL at its longest layer but I'm sure it will secure hair much longer.Highly recommended purchase and will definitely be ordering more in future
4,Starz Cable movie,"I enjoyed ""The ladykiller"". It was funny, cute, crazy and stupid. Although it did have too many four letter word..Over kill.Most of all it was entertaining. Forget the reviews, watch and enjoy. I give it 4 stars."
3,A CLUMSY FEATHER IN THE COENS' OTHERWISE STRIKING CAP,"Despite a riveting central performance from Irma Hall, an invigorating gospel soundtrack, and a few situations that echo the Coens' better works (Fargo, Raising Arizona or even The Hudsucker Proxy), Ladykillers is a would-be wacky romp that never develops the comic energy it so desparately needs to take off.It's remake that, like most remakes, falls flat despite many of the Coen brothers' usual elements of occasionally funny blowhards, visual gags, inventive camera work and florid language (a lot of the swearing was absolutely unnecessary). In fact, the movie just plain drags in the middle of its 100+ minutes.Tom Hanks is convincing as usual, but this is perhaps one of his oddest roles to date, a miscalculation from start to finish. One wonders what is becoming of the Coens, given other recent misfires such as Intolerable Cruelty. Skip this tripe, or rent it out when it's out there if you are a diehard Coens fan."
1,Worst movie of all time,If I could have ginven this movie zero stars I would have. About 20 minutes into the movie I just started fast fowarding until something looked interesting. Needless to say I fast foward through almost the whole movie. Do not waste your money on this movie.
1,Awful,"I am not sure what has become of the usually masterful Coen Bros., but this film simply sucks. First of all, it is a completely unnecessary remake of an older and much more elegant film, and second, its over-the-top portrayals of typical stereotypes (from ""Southern gentleman"" to Buckwheat/angry black man to soulful-yet-clueless black mama figures) reeks of audience pandering.And will someone please explain to me why Tom Hanks is chosen to play such a wide variety of characters..? C'mon - he REALLY ain't that good...see this film as proof."
3,LadyKiller movie,Too much profanity; had I known beforehand I would'nt have bought it. Though the movie has a good plot and storyline the excessive bad language affects this movie negatively. Its better to see Ladykillers on TV where the cursing is removed.
3,You broght you're b*tch to the waffle hut?!,"deffinatley not the Coen's best film but pretty funny in parts, kind of a predictable comedy/crime drama but still what can i ay, there's something about Coen bros. movies that sets them apart form the rest"
2,See the original -- it's simply better!,"The Coen brothers are brilliant filmmakers but they are inconsistent. Fargo and Blood Simple are certainly American classics but too many of their films are simply...loopy. This is a perfect example of remaking a film that was perfect its first time around. Before you see this, do yourself a favor and see the British version directed by Alexander Mackendrick. Then see Mackendrick's other films such as ""The Man In The White Suit"" (also with Alec Guiness) and ""The Sweet Smell Of Success"". You'll have spent your time -- and money -- more wisely."
2,This movie will not please the normal person...,"This is my first movie review and I'm ashamed that it has to be a bad one but hey it's fun to be here. My wife and I are normal hard working white collar people who love all sorts of movies. I don't think we've ever missed a new release together on DVD. My word speaks for those like us out there, please have trust in my comments. Fargo was great...O brother was a little less than great....Ladykillers is not so great. Mr. Wayans is funny at times but eventually you get sick of the abusive language. Tom Hanks tries to overwhelm us with his brillance and falls short in this one, sorry Tom big fan but no on LK. The characters were interesting if the movie was a short skit but two hours of the same babble from each character got tiring. The story lacked pace and excitment. Too slow and not enough action. We got the metaphor of the whole movie but by the end it didn't satisfy. I suggest you pass on this one even if you are a Tom Hanks or Coen fan."
2,Waste of time,Would not watch it a second time.....RidiculousCan't believe I actually finished this movie!We love Tom Hanks....but not this one!
2,Cohen Bros: no longer a sign of taste in filmmaking,"I'm used to automatically seeing anything associated with the Cohen Brothers. The previews for The Ladykillers made it look like a charming, Southern US, caper film. Sure enough, there were plenty of grey-haired folks in the theatre. I can't imagine they expected the constant MF swearing from one of the chracters.This is a remake of the 1955 hit UK film of the same name starring Peter Sellers and Alec Guiness. The new version relies on repetitive gag humour and the clash between a conservative Christian woman and a foul-mouthed, ""hippity-hop"" criminal, to get most of its laughs. Some of the other supporting cast members are nothing but dumb cliches (big, dumb jock, quiet, sly Communist Chinese General, etc.) Tom Hanks plays the role of ring leader as if he were a cartoon character.There's really no intrigue or really good humour in this obvious Cohen Brothers sellout. Not a must-see film."
2,I've got the tenth-rate remake blues,"The Ladykillers--remade with irritable bowel movements? WHY?What a falling off was there! Run, do not walk to the Alec Guinness version to see what was so foully trampled on here.Two stars ... because the professor and the lady are not always entirely awful."
3,Could be better,It's funny how a movie can have the right elements but still not quite deliver. It's a good movie but compared to 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou' and 'Raising Arizona' it doesn't deliver as well. Still a good movie though.
2,A Serious Disappointment.,"Well, my major problem with The Ladykillers is that it was made by the Coen brothers who are the finest filmmakers in the world this side of Marty Scorsese. This has to be the only movie they've made which I'd describe as being below average, and that's really all that it is. The Ladykillers is not a bad movie, but considering the quality of its creators, its mediocrity comes as quite a shock. I don't agree with the other reviewers in regards to Tom Hanks. I think he gives a credible performance. I think the production's real problem is a result of its low quality plot. The original film with Alec Guinness was not great and attempting to update it was not advisable. Personally, I hope that this movie is just a mulligan for the Coen brothers and not a reflection of their diminishing genius. Everyone is entitled to a mistake once in awhile and no better word embodies The Ladykillers."
1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen!,"I started watching this video, and had to turn if off after about 15 minutes! When I saw the scene about a dog being suffocated from wearing a gas mask (which was supposed to be funny), I just couldn't take it anymore and shut it off. This is a disgusting movie - a shame - because the original is so good!"
2,Jobst Stocking,"I purchased an open toe Beige Large Jobst Medical Legware and when I opened the package one of the pairs of stockings had a slight tear. In addition, the compression on the 30-40 mm/Hg did not have the ability to alleviate the swelling of my lower leg (notation - I have used 30-40 mm/Hg for the last 19 years); however, I am not sure if it was due it being open-toed. Nevertheless, it did not work too well regarding my swelling of my leg."
3,Pomobabble and Cartoons,"This book briefly touches on many areas of maths, some old and some new, often uses the passive voice in regards to historically significant theorems in math without reference to the fuller context or reasons why they were deemed significant or who proved them and how. Being an ""introducing"" of course the book is limited in its scope and can only scratch the surface for most of its topics, of which it does an Ok job with.But the bigger bone I have to pick is with the cultural studies stuff towards the end. Mathematics IS a cultural activity, and is what it is today, not stricly because of Eurocentric hegemony and cultural domination with value-laden theorems, but because mathematical ideas and approaches to proof are ""traded"" amongst cultures in a broader and larger Marketplace of Ideas.Some recent books challenging Platonism (Where Mathematics Comes From, The Mathematical Experience) are better constructed with more limited theses."
3,still a whodunnit,"Mystic River by novelist Dennis Lehane was recommended to me as a crime novel with a bit more than your average thriller diller: some philosphical speculation, some intellectual asides.In general, MR gets a notch or two above the average ""Spenser for Hire"" novel, but all in all it's still a hard-boiled whodunnit. There's some thinking going on about the state of the world, almost a lamentation for the good old days and simpler ways, but I can't say I was totally impressed with the cranial chit-chat. Especially when the lead characters--tough SOB's from what amounts to Boston's Warzone--begin using high-falutin' words and sophsticated language more appropriate for a graduate survey class in literature.Still, Lehane has a way with presenting suspenseful situations and has the occasional great turn of phrase (""It was like the waiting room to a riot.""). It's a page-turner, sure; it just isn't in any danger of knocking ""Grapes of Wrath"" off its pedestal."
4,Great Story,I heard about the movie but never saw it. The book started a little slow but took off and never slowed down after that and had twisted end.
2,This book drags,"Perhaps if I'd grown up in NYC I might find this work more interesting...as it is, I have to agree with the other reviewer who found the characters too two dimensional. Also, when a writer gets technical details wrong, it tends to put me off and the plot becomes as a cardboard facade - I begin to see ""the man behind the curtain"". For example, a female character decides she will destroy evidence by taking off the grease trap under the sink and cleaning it (wouldn't pouring bleach or something through the pipe do this?). She manages this with a LUG wrench. I'd like for someone to explain how one could use a lug wrench to remove the elbow from under the sink. Sheesh."
1,Trash,"I only got to 5% of reading and was so disgusted that I am trying to delete it from my Kindle. The language he chose for these 11 year old boys to use at the first of the book, was vulgar and just plain trash. It almost gives a person some insite to his personal life and how he allows perhaps his own children to use such vulgar language. I will never read another book by this author. I enjoy a mystery that keeps my attention without using such fowl language and there are many such books."
1,The one star is for effort!,"I eagerly awaited Dennis Lehane's new novel, knowing that it was not about Patrick and Angie, but hopeful that it would keep me on the edge of my seat as all previous novels had. Unfortunately, this didn't happen. I started and stopped twice while reading the first chapter before making a commitment to myself to read the book through; by the end I was skimming so as to be done with it. I expected so much more...I guess I really expected Patrick and Angie! Oh, well, I guess I'll dig in my heels and settle back for the next year while I await the next Lehane novel!"
2,Eastwood Cries a Better River,"I don't often come across a book that I like less than its movie adaptation, but Mystic River happened to be one of those books. Just because an author can elaborate with thousands of words - it doesn't mean that he should, and this incredibly drawn out story made me wish for the exactness of gifted authors like Graham Greene. Clint Eastwood did the story justice though - and his portrayal of the characters was exactly what the audience needed to know..."
2,A Powerhouse? More like the Outhouse!,"This novel APPEARS to be a suspenseful powerhouse, however, the author fails (miserably) to tie up all the loose ends into a nice neat package. The so called element of surprise is a complete let down. Don't get me wrong, the book is fascinating up until approximately three-quarters through. It is here that the author begins to spin a web of characters and events so convoluted the readers head begins to swim. The climax is weak, juvenile, and truly disappointing. Ultimately a futile attempt at suspense."
2,Just OK,"This book was just OK. To me, the plot was predictable, with none of the ""twists & turns"" that Lehane is supposedly so famous for. I wonder if this book would have received as much attention if it hadn't been made into a film ( which I have not seen). I stuck it out to the end, because it had received such laudatory reviews, but I was very disappointed."
2,"Depressing, over-use of profanity, tedious and too long","You could tell the author is probably a fairly good writer, but his extreme over-use of profanity (every other word is the ""F"" word!) is annoying and detracts from the story so much that after a while, I could hardly read it. EVERYBODY in his story talks like that - very unrealistic! And the whole story is so gruesome and depressing and goes on and on and on, that it became a real chore to read. I'll have to say NOT RECOMMENDED for this book. For sure I'd be too embarrassed to recommend this to anyone I know - it comes across as sleazy trash because of all the gutter language."
4,Mystic River,"Dennis Lehane's Mystic River is a suspenseful, mind-teasing thriller that keeps the reader geussing and wanting to read more. One of three friends gets kidnapped and molested as a child, but manages to escape four days later. Twenty-five years after that, the friends have grown apart, and one of the men's daughters has been mysteriously murdered. This tragic event brings the three boys back together again and shows that the past can never be hidden or forgotten. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to be kept geussing with a suspenseful murder mystery."
4,Excellent,"I loved his earlier novels but Mystic River surpasses them all. Lehane flaunts his ability as a writer with incredible characterizations and a gripping plot. Disturbing, thoughtful, and incredibly well written - I couldn't put it down."
4,A Tale of Three Boys,"An academy-award winning movie based upon a phenomenal book. Three 11-year old boys are confronted by two men in a car while playing ball in the street in 1975, Sean Devine, daredevil Jimmy Marcus, and quiet, tag-along, Dave Boyle. Thinking the men were the police, the one man instructed Dave to get into the car so he could take him home to the Flats (poor section of Boston). Dave did as he was told only to be locked in a cellar and become the victim of child molesters. Dave escapes, and the boys go their separate ways only to be brought together again, twenty five years later, as the result of the murder of Jimmy's 19 year old daughter, Katie. Dave's trauma, resonated upon Sean and Jimmy, changes the course of their lives. As they struggle to find the real killer, their boyhood issues surface to become consequences of their actions. Mystic River is a story not to be ignored."
4,Nail biting mystery,"Dennis Lehane weaves a wonderfully nail biting tragic mystery with excellent character portrayal and exciting plot build.Dave Boyle, Sean Divine and Jimmy Marcus, three childhood friends divided by social boundaries and an incident that leaves them changed forever, must intersect their lives again as adults when Jimmy's daughter is found murdered in the city park.Sean, now a detecive with the Boston State Police, is assigned to investigate the murder. He finds Dave Boyle's name on his witness list and questions him about the murder. Sean really doesn't think Dave has any knowledge of the murder but Sean's partner is totally convinced.... nor is Dave's wife. The wife that knows Dave's inner secrets and the demons that live in his head.This was my first Lehane novel and I was impressed. I will definitely be picking up more novels by this author."
2,A bit of a drag,"If you are looking for an exciting, relaxing mystery novel, you should skip this one. Lehane shows the grief and suffering caused by murder, but there is little payoff. For much of the novel, you are manipulated into thinking a particular character has committed the murder, but the narrator is rather overtly playing games with you, setting you up, in a way that feels intrusive. At the same time, you spend more of your time feeling depressed along with the victim's family members than you do following the process of discovering whodunit. The characters are carefully drawn, but the only insight this book tries to offer is that sometimes a person commits murder because they've been made to suffer themselves. After putting up with Lehane's lugubrious style and long passages that urge you to feel depressed, this is not enough to justify the pain. Not a very fun read."
2,First Dennis Lehane book read- very disappointing.,"I have heard so much about Dennis Lehane that I felt obligated to read this new book. I'm kind of sorry that I did. Very convoluted, improbable plot; it tried the imagination. Perhaps the biggest fault of this book, however, lies in the main characters. Not one of them stood up as an admirable human being, and it was almost impossible for me (the reader) to develop any sort of rapport with any of them. For that matter, neither did the secondary cast of characters. They were all seriously flawed, and this set the tone for this novel. The reason that I gave this book two stars was because Lehane is obviously a very talented writer. From the way he handles words you can tell that given a different plot and a different cast of characters he could be one of the best."
4,My first Lehane novel,"This was my first Dennis Lehane novel, and when I was finished I immediately went out and bought his first few (A Drink Before War, etc.). I was addicted almost immediately and thoroughly enjoyed myself until the end. I would recommend it!"
3,$11.99 a bottle? For real??,"Love, love, love the syrup, but don't buy it here! You can get it direct from DaVinci Gourmet for only $7.99 a bottle, and three bottles is only $4.95 in shipping. One of the few things Amazon doesn't have cheaper than everyone else."
5,What memories!,"With all of today's Sci-Fi movies and TV shows, you would think you haven't seen very much new. Well, once you start enjoying Fireball XL-5, you will realize that many of the things you've been seeing recently were created way back in the early sixties.Fireball XL-5 uses many tricks, gimmicks, innovations and logic to bring the future to life. I won't give any of the good stuff away, but in this show, you will see things that appeared in Star Trak, Star Wars, etc.It is wonderful to relive an important part of my childhood, while at the same time, realizing that so much created for this series was borrowed by other more recent shows. This should definitely be part of any Sci-Fi fan's collection."
2,stiff,"excuse the pun, but i agree with some of the other reviews that said the characters are rigid and uninteresting. Fasinating subject and I was intrigued with the setup: Over the hill Porno directer gets back in the buis. even though morally he has quams. I'll make this short, first twenty minutes pretty cool. Including a hard core sex scene that i found quite hot. But after that it goes to this french; anarchy, Political, extistential, (feel free to put another word here that i can't spell), deal. Maybe they should have put that scene at the end so that we had to pay for our dinner. If you buy it get for cheap. Best feature; scence selection goes right to sex scence making future viewings easy."
4,Wonderful Bond Homage,"I loved this movie. In many ways, this movie is as much a loving Bond spoof as the French OSS 117 films with Jean Dujardin...though not nearly as broadly comical. Everything about the film is brilliantly on-target, from the staging to the John Barry/David Arnold-esque music. The movie is structurally an homage to DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (stealing the teaser almost beat-for-beat) and yet surprisingly original, too. As a child, Mandrill sees his parents killed and grows up seeking revenge against their murderer. The clever twist here is that Mandrill intentionally models himself on ""John Colt,"" a cheesy 70s Bond/Shaft/Flint character. So you get a spoof within an homage. Cheeky. If you are fan of Bond films, Blaxploitation, and Eurospy movies, this is a must-see. Now I have to find the soundtrack!"
5,Maybe baby,"This book was very enjoyable. It was fun to read with some laugh out moments, even though you could predict the ending."
4,Guide for Seasons 11 & 12,"This particular book follows the eleventh and twelfth seasons of the ""Simpsons."" We are offered summaries for each episode, as well as chalkboard and couch gags, hard-to-know facts and trivia, and character sketches and designs from various episodes. This is a great addition to the first two books in the series, but seems to be filled with some extra, not very essential material, just to seem larger and worthy of the price. Yet, in any event, I think if you are a big ""Simpsons"" watcher, or want to know more about these seasons, this book is a great purchase."
5,A Masterpiece of intellect and mysticism; a Poem.,"This is a profound and learned book that is experienced as much as read. I first found it in college and the reread was an equalling enlightening journey. With insights from Freud, Blake, and buddhist mysticism it destroys the Reality Principle and the traps of literal interpretation. It leads us to know the Silence behind the words."
1,"Gimmicky, cutesy, cheesy, irritating","If you like Manhattan Transfer, you might like this. If you find them to be a soulless jazzy glee club, then you probably won't like this. The singer has one of those generic woman's jazz voices that mistakes vocal gymnastics for expressive power. Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, for example, had amazing voices that did all sorts of tricks, but at their core they sang with feeling.This album is like a special effects movie with a poor plot and bad acting. All the sounds are there, but the emotion isn't. Yuck."
3,How spicy do you like it?,"This book is ok -- not bad, not great. Vivi Anna has done a great job of creating the Hell Kat character -- a motorcycle riding treasure hunter who likes sex. What I particularly liked was that Kat's character evolved through the course of the book, mostly described through her relationships with Damien, her former slave, Hades, a peer, and Baruch, the evil dark lord. I'm not much into vampires, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the story. This book is not literature, but it is a fun and sexy read."
4,Good for Starting a Collection,"I have liked almost every recipe that I have tried from this book. I have purchased it twice. Once for myself and once as a gift for a friend. I would recommend it for anyone starting out a vegan kitchen. If you already have loads of vegan cookbooks, you might want to just skip this one and get a specialty cookbook like ""The Mediterrean Vegan Kitchen""."
5,Another love story!,"My favorite vegetarian cookbook! I was given this by a cousin when I was about 14, and have since worn it to death! It's one of my bibles, when I want ideas or a quick technique. One or two recipes haven't been impressive, but there's many others that I go back to time and again. As a vegetarian, I always subbed milk/butter/eggs for any substitute products, but as I'm looking to eat more vegan, it's come through again.Love it!"
3,Dog Psychology Training for Humans,"[...]I really enjoyed listening to Cesar Millan talking about the psychology of dogs, however, it is stated as a ""People Training for Dogs"". I feel it is incorrectly titled and should be something like ""Dog Psychology 101"" because it had very little to do with training a dog. The majorityof the DVD was explaining how dog's think and react versus how they are trained. I think his TV show does a much better job in escribing specific behavioral problems and by knowing the psychology of the dog you are able to control or manage the animal's behavior. At best it teaches you to manage dog's behavior but it doesn't ""train"" people like he says."
3,overpriced,"I have to agree with all those who say it should be half the price charged..he probably needs the money to feed all those dogs! I love the shows on TV and was hoping for more details and examples, one hour is way too short for this much money. I will be donating it to my local library so other dog owners will get some good advise without spending all that money. When his book comes out I would go to a bookstore to browse through it to find out how much useful material is really there before deciding to spend any more money on his products."
2,Dog psychology is still a mystery.,"Cesar Milan's techniques have always intrigued me. Every week I look forward to see what wild dogs he is taming next. The ""Dog Whisperer"" is loaded with techniques and examples on how he deals with these animals. Unfortunately this is not the case with ""People training for dogs"". The DVD contains a few dog psychology basics, which Cesar fails to back it up with visual examples. A lengthy lecture is all that is provided. I am a visual learner and this DVD might be better suited for auditory learning."
1,Save your Money.,"After finishing approximately 1/4 of the book, I came to the conclusion that I was robbed. I installed WSH and typed in all code within the first few days. Errors are rampant and it takes too much time to debug the author's typos. I emailed the author for help with some of the code and apparently he doesn't care. Would not recommend the book to someone trying to learn. I think he has the right idea, but the code should work. There are no excuses."
3,Good Movie but Confirm the Region Code,"The other, previous reviews collectively discuss the content of the new ""Broken Noses"" fairly.When I ordered the item from a USA-based vendor via Amazon, the item showed up quickly. The issue was that it was a Region 2 (Europe) disc and not a Region 1 (North America) or region-free disc. So I have sent it back.The Amazon write-up said only that the item was in DVD format, which I interpreted optimistically. Either the distributors need to make the situation clear, or the purchasers have to be more vigilent."
2,Mashed potato,"If, like me, you mostly read at night in bed, don't choose this book. No-one should go to sleep in an irritable mood, having painfully re-read pages to ascertain what the author is trying to say, disentangling the contorted lines of thought and timelines. Although crammed with information, much of it seems contrived, anecdotal and you have to expend too much energy digging deep to get to the core of the history of the spud. When you do, it is indeed interesting. But don't labour over this book - read COD instead for easy-read insight into how single food sources make and break entire populations."
5,Both great and disappointing,"While i really liked this book and found it full of useful information and insightful analysis, i also found the book very disappointing.I was disappointed by his treatment of the pre-Colombian aspects of the potato's history. We find out little about the origins of the potato, its importance and uses in pre-Colombian South America, etc. (They are part of the Western World) We also find little about the potato itself. The book is Eurocentric and just a social history. These are both shortcomings of the book and strengths.Zuckerman, who writes quite well, provides us with a tremendous social history of the potato in a few countries: France, England, Ireland and the US. The book ranges far and weaves a complex historical story with great explanations. Just the discussion on how social attitudes towards the potato is worth the cost of the book. I would recommend this book, but be forewarned that it is a limited social history."
4,Excellent Read,"By looking at possible motives behind Japanese war crimes committed in WWII, Yuki Tanaka clearly separates himself from other authors writing on this disturbing subject.After detailing selected incidents of war crimes committed by the Japanese, Tanaka postulates various motives (some plausible, some a stretch) for the horrible atrocities that were unleashed upon the unfortunate victims.This book is as much about trying to determine ""why it happened"" as it is about ""what happened""."
3,Product Good but NO WARRANTY!,"This product works well. I love it. However, it didn't come with a serial number so I have NO idea if it's an authorized version or what. I'm in communication with Amazon and Payless Beauty - the people Amazon outsourced this to. If I don't get a recognized serial number I will return it. I will update this posting when I have more information."
5,Simply Gem,"An expedition dairy enriched with informative data on places visited on a known for cannibalistic traditions remote province of Indonesia, illustrated with lovely photos taken professionally-explicit."
4,Great less expensive choice,"My mother has chronic leg swelling ( the poor dear has cancer ) and her doctor recommended a support hose. I went to a medical supply company; they were ridiculoulsy expensive. These are the highest support without a prescription and they work great. Wide cuff mean it doesn't roll at her knee. Does require practice to get on, but are comfortable all day long. I got two pairs, one to wear and one to wash. Works great."
5,excellent choice,"Excellent compression stockings, comfortable and effective. Jobst are the best. These stockings last for years without losing their elasticity. Great choice..."
2,Inconsistent Quality,"A few months ago I purchased the same item and am (still) very pleased with the quality. Because of my experience I ordered another pair.When the new pair arrived, due to a manufacturing defect, they would not to stay in place and were promptly replaced by the seller. Unfortunately, the replacement pair were also defective and ran after an hour's use. Nevertheless, the seller refused to exchange them stating that it was unlikely that two pair would be defective.Despite the fact that they are the most expensive support hose and were recommended by my doctor, there seems to be a great inconsistency in the quality of this product.I am reluctant to try again and will look for a different and, hopefully, more reliable product."
5,Very good,Jobst is the best value I have found. THEY ALSO ARE EASIER TO PUT ON THAN ANY OTHERS I HAVE TRIED. They are the only brand I will buy.
5,Comfortable fit,"The knee-hi fits well, and once I have it on, it is very comfortable. I learned a couple of years ago how to get this type of hose on relatively easy, so it really isn't a problem to put it on. I usually wear a compression hose on just my left leg, although every now and then I will wear on on both legs."
3,Raveling at the seams,"The initial quality of the product was great, but after some washings the seams near the top of the stocking have started to come apart with long strings needing to be clipped off. I do not believe this product will last too long; and given the price and the need to wear this type of product daily, I am very disappointed with the durability that I have seen from this pair."
3,Pretty Good,"I got this cd back in the summer of '01, along with volumes 17 and 18. I love Dream Dance cds so much that I had to buy all 3 at the same time so no one else would buy them first.(There was only one copy of each.) I'd have to say that with vol.19 though, I enjoy disc 2 better. There's just more of a steady flow of good tracks. My favorite song on disc 1 would've easily been ""Maid of Orleans"" if it didn't stop half way through the song, and for a whole minute play what sounds like a tribute to war veterans. So with that said, I'll happily settle for Darude vs. JS10's remix of Dooh Dooh. Another great track with even more QUALITY is Plastic Angel's ""Sweet Sixteen"". My disc 2 favorites are ""City Lights"", ""Daytime"", ""Motion"", ""Dance with you"", ""Here we go"", ""The Touch"", ""Return to innocence"", ""The Afterworld"", ""Castles in the sky"", and ""Up and Down"". A good album with lots of different styles. 3 stars."
2,not much use; could be better,"My sister got me one of these one year, and I thought it would be a great addition to my French study. As a calendar it sucks since there's no month on each page, just the current day. Also, you are given a whole sentence and yet are given the definition/pronunciation of a single word. You don't get the literal translation unless it's very idiomatic, either, and you get the definition of but one word out of the whole sentence. What good is that? Once in a while there is a mistake, I've found, too."
1,Very useless,"wouaouw!! If you want to learn some useless French, that's what you need!! I'm very disapointed.."
3,Combo usb/card reader,"Very cheap, works ok, the mini usb connection on to the computer dosn't hold up well, keeps falling out. Otherwise works well."
3,Boxed Marbles,I bought two sets of these to go with the Melissa & Dougs Chinese checkers board because the marbles that come with it are very difficult to play with because of the background on the board and the color of the marbles. I picked out 20 marbles to use with the board and then gave the boxed sets to my two grandsons and we learned to play marbles together. They enjoy having their own boxes and will use them for many things over the years. I do hope they are durable!
3,"This version is NOT hardcover, even through the story and illustrations are Great","This is an incredible story about humbly recognizing the Truth, even when it (He) appears in an unexpected form. Whenever a great Savior comes to the people of the world, He is rejected because He does not look like, or act like, or speak like people think He should.The hardback version of this book is 11x8 inches. This version is 8-1/2x7 inches (printed on paper 8-1/2x8-1/2 inches with extra-wide upper and lower borders). Do not let the picture of this book on Amazon.com fool you, nor the claim this is hardback. NEVERTHELESS, if this is the only version of this book available, and at this remarkably low price, I urge you to purchase it."
1,"Wonderful book, terrible printing.","I love this book. I had it as a child and it is one of many that clearly remember. However, this particular copy was a major disappointment. My children received it for Christmas, because I put it on my wish list. The cover is as beautiful as I remember it but it doesn't go beyond that. The pages inside are black and white, tiny, and look like somebody printed them from an old cheap printer. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS EDITION!"
2,Broken after 1 year of use,"The fan worked fine for about a year, then the fan mount broke off from the engine section and the blades were slamming loudly into the side of the housing. Damage is not repairable; total loss."
4,fun overall,"Overall, my 2 daughters (ages 10 and 15) like this game a lot. The different levels make it easy for anyone to play. However, the music choices could be a little better, and it's difficult it find out what's on it before you buy it."
4,"Not bad, but still a step back","I've played various PS2 DDR games nearly daily for years (as enjoyable exercise, 3-6 hours weekly), and was looking forward to another set of songs to put into my cycle. I unlocked all the songs and played through all of them that I could a number of times. Ultimately, I've had to put Supernova to the side, and I don't play it anymore.There are two problems - the main one is that a lot of the songs are slow, and while the associated steps may be complicated, this merely makes them hard, rather than good exercise (as opposed to something like Hysteria, from DDR Max 2, which is perfect). The second is that it's no longer possible to quickly pass through the scoring screen, so there's a longer pause between songs. It's not as bad as In The Groove (which was awful), but it is long enough to get in way of good exercise.My favorite offering so far is still DDR Extreme 2, although I cycle through DDR Max, DDR Max 2, and DDR Extreme as well."

1,Boring,"The message: real teams are good. The authors rave about all the great things a well functioning team can accomplish and give several examples.The authors set out to figure out what makes a real team and how people that put these together do it. It is a worthwhile purpose. The problem is that the ""insights"" revealed are old and rather useless. For example, the authors found that teams that had clearly stated goals performed better than teams that had not agreed on common goals. If this is news to you, you should buy the book.1 star out of 5"
5,Excellent Overview on the Scope of Workflow,"This book puts workflow in its proper context - much more: it convincingly shows how pervasive the subject has become, despite earlier reports on its death as yet another hype gone sour. On the contrary, the most glorious days for this technology still lie ahead as is eloquently presented in the chapter by Carl Frappolo ""The many Generations of workflow"", which I particularly enjoyed. It becomes clear that the biggest driver of this technology is and will be the internet, whether for e-business, e-government or enterprise portals, actually for most future web application. And this also means continuous adaptation and further development of the field. It is not surprising: after all behind many web application there is some process, and the automation of a process is called workflow by definition, even if it is not made explicit. I strongly recommend the book to anybody concerned with internet/intranet applications."
2,hapin 1002 Hand Sprayer - Multi Purpose Sprayer - 48 oz.,"I was not satisfied with this product. After putting solution in it, closed the cap and used, I tried to twist it off to use again and the handle snapped off, the pressure was not strong at all. I believe the handle should be reinforced with thicker or better material."
5,Gift Idea,"My best friend and I go to different colleges and our freshmen year we started writing letters to each other. To make it more interesting we jokingly made them into dramatic love letters. As part of her birthday present this year, I got her this kit to add authenticity to any love letters that she sends. Although I bought this with a not-very-serious plan in mind, that doesn't mean it wouldn't make a good present in a non-joke capacity."
3,"Solid sourcebook, but not quite an adventure","Ever wonder what really happened to the glorious ruined grandeur of Myth Drannor? This book describes it all - if you're a fan of Tolkien's Silmarillion, you'll quickly find yourself swept up in the tragic majesty of the elven kingdoms - swords and spells flash, heroes die, demons battle, and the world comes to an end... besides all the battle descriptions and maps, this compendium also includes adventure hooks galore, ultra-powerful elven magic, and more. Best of all, this is an Arcane Age supplement - there's enough information here that if you want to run a ""back in time"" scenario in which the PCs are swept up in these epic events, more power to you! A great addition to any Forgotten Realms campaign."
1,What a whiner....,"I cannot believe that anyone would let their child watch a Caillou video! All he does is whine and cry the whole time. If something doesn't go his way, he cries and throws a fit. There are far better characters out there for children thatn Caillou. Save your money and get something else."
5,Great for beginner!,"Great price and shipping time. This is great for a beginner. Will admit, we are going crazy listening to it all the time. At least he is getting his money worth! LOL!"
2,Off key in two weeks,"Cheap harmonica...good brand. I bought it to jam w/out worrying about bustin it. It is now off key horribly, and I can't draw through the five hole. Bending is impossible-"
5,"The long-awaited answer to ""One hudred years of solitude""","An amazing book! I can't remember myself being taken so far and swept so much by a book, since the first time I read ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"". Only Chandra goes even further than Garcia Marques with his imagination, taking us to regions of the world unknown before. I couldn't stop reading this book. One of those books you wish will never end, and once it does - you go back to the first page to ""take a look"" and find yourself reading it all over again."
3,hmmmmmmmmmmm,"This album is great musically, however lyrically, it is somewhat inapropriate. I was happy to find that Drakes first album was very clean and had no suggestions of anything lewd. But in the FIRST SONG of this album, there is already questionable content. I quote ""and whenyou're creeping out of bed I sneak a peek to see just what you were wearing last night or what wasleftover from ripping off our clothes."" I also liked the first album better musically. My suggestion: get the first album, Telegraph before they are all gone."
3,Parents be warned,"This is a good cd. That being said, I do think that parents buying this cd should be warned that the first song ""Up Periscope"" is about sex. I bought this cd for my 11 year old, who loves Drake Bell, and I was very dismayed at the first songs lyrics about ripping his girlfriends clothes off!He is obviously distancing himself from his teenybopper image. The rest of the album is fine, but I wouldn't have bought this cd if I'd known about that song before hand. Definitely not ""tween"" appropriate!"
5,"Finally, a great book on the Dead","Searching for the Sound is a great book for any GD fan.Written by an insider, this is the definitive work on the Dead."
3,"I love Phil,but...","I was so excited to read this book, finally a true insiders look at the history of the band. I found that much was brushed over, especially later years of the band. And what was covered has been widely covered in previus books."
5,THE BEST HOW-TO GUIDE AROUND,"I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to know the basics of straw-bale construction. I have worked with the authors in introducing straw-bale construction techniques in a community-development context in Mongolia and China, and I can say from first-hand experience that the authors know what they are talking about (some designs from our Mongolia work ended up in the book). In China, where my organization is working to promote sustainable housing design, I use the book to explain to government officials and others just what straw-bale construction is all about. Because the illustrations are so clear, the book is very useful in this context. I have passed out some 20 copies in China so far, and have had requests for far more."
1,AS BAD AS AN OLD SOAP OPERA---AND TWICE AS BORING,"This was not a romance, it was a sloooow-moving, flat, boring tale about a conniving family who meddled in each other's lives and called it caring. It went so way beyond a total waste of my time. Be sure to read all of the 1 star review by ""A Customer"" as it sums up this book perfectly."
1,Deceptive adverising,"Although the Amazon website says that this product is 5/8 inch diameter, it is actually 1/2 inch. The packaging for the product doesn't even give a diameter. Perhaps that is why it cannot be sold in California where they have strict labeling laws. I really needed a new soaker hose and my local home supply stores were all out of 5/8 inch hose, so I just kept the product."
2,Wouldn't buy from this seller,"Lancome Definicils is a high qualitly product. I rated this just 2 stars b/c I think the seller must have had it for awhile b/c after a very short while it was dry and clumpy. This happens all to soon even when I buy it from the department store, but from this seller it happened even sooner. I will re-order it next time from Lancome on-line and pay the shipping."
1,A 200-POUND GORILLA,"With 1080p LCDs and plasmas already available on the market right now, WHY would you still wanna buy this contraption?Just imagine having to haul this massive thing up and down the stairs in a few years from now!"
4,Good basic CAD program,"An excellent basic computer drafting program. User inferface that is not too dificult to pick up, and includes a reasonable collection of symbols. Help is fair. I could use more information fairly often. No programming interface that I have found. No auto-dimensioning. Snaps and alignment are always problematic and there is no solution here.A high bang for the buck item."
2,AutoSketch 9,If you are the average person (like me) wanting to create a drawing be prepared to take a study to learn this program. Otherwise you will not get the drawing you want. Too hard to understand.
1,Clunky disappointment,"I bought this to throw together some quick drawings for clients, but it is so clunky, that I just use my full version of AutoCAD 2006. I admit that I have not spent any time trying to set it up, and I have spent years setting up AutoCAD."
3,help,"I discovered my 14yr old son making amazing house plans on our Paint program. He has also designed T-shirts for a BMX bike company.Which would be an appropriate software program to further his design/architectural interests and talents and not too ""over his head"" that it would cause frustration and intimadation. Keep in mind he is 14yrs old with no drafting experience.Thank you,Mom"
5,Excellent Value For a Mechanical Drafting Program,"I purchased this program after trying to install an older version of AutoCadLT that just wouldn't work with WindowsXP. By the way I paid over $500 for that version. I've used AutoSketch to build a wheel chair ramp and it worked perfectly. This program is everything I will need to get dimensioned drawings for projects that require this type of work. I'm using it now to see how existing furniture will fit into a new house we're in the process of buying. So far no complaints - you will have to be familiar with principals of mechanical drafting to get the most from this, but out of the box I was productive and very proficient in a couple of days."
1,Way too unrealistic to be valid,"OK, so I read the reviews and bought this book. It is very new-age writing; memories from the womb, miscarriages and stillbirths to amend lost souls. It is very far out. And the author mandates all bad things that happen in a relationship are the fault of the heartbroken person. We all need to accept responsibility for our actions but this takes it too far. According to this author, all things bad in a relationship are the responsiblity of the hurt person. I read it twice, looking for a bit of advice and comfort and ended up almost laughing. Save your money!"
3,Better than some but not the best,"I've tried several of these creams, most of which haven't worked at all. With this one, at least you can feel it doing something when you put it on. I noticed a bit of a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead at first. That got me pretty excited however the excitement quickly faded when the lines reappeared about an hour later. The product is good for a quick fix if you are going out for a night on the town. A friend of mine just recently told me about another similar product called Athena 7 minute lift and her results were much better than mine. I guess I'll have to try that one next."
1,How old are the people this worked for?,"I recently had an opportunity to try Freeze...not hoping for much and that is what I got. It feels like it's doing something, but alas it does not. How could anyone justify the cost of this product? I know we all want quick fixes...but this is not it. I'm glad it only took me $14.00 to try it out wasnt even worth that. The people on this site that said it worked, must be in their 20's. Save your money for the botox..."
4,Sobering Book,"I could not put the book down once I started. It's very sobering to read about what these men went through. My uncle fought there and somehow survived, but many of his friends did not. The personal accounts and thoughts revealed in the book are chilling. I purchased this book knowing he had been there. It makes you think again how lucky we are to be able to take a lot of freedom for granted nowdays. God bless these men."
5,BOB MARLEY (SONG OF FREEDOM) THE COLLECTION.,"IM A BOB MARLEY FAN, I JUST BIGINING TO BUY CD'S. MY FRIEND HAD THE A CD OF BOB M. CALLED (SONG OF FREEDOM THE COLLECTION) IM TRIYING HARD TO GET A COPY OF IT BECAUSE MY FRIEND LOST THE CD, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW CAN I GET A COPY. ITS OUT OF PRINT BUT IF SOMEONE SELL IT I WILL BUY IT, OR I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE THAT HAVE THE CD TO RECORD IT FOR ME, I WILL PROVIDE THE TAPE WHAT EVER YOU NEED FOR RECORDING.THANKS..."
3,This cd is dope dudes!,This CD runs just like James Allen ... slow and sloppy! This CD is just plain dope ...
3,Moonbug,"Gives me about an hour battery life. Better than no life and being completely power cord-dependent. All in all, I am glad I finally bought a new battery for my Toshiba Satellite Tablet R20."
2,weak!,"When buying a guitar stand, the last thing you think about is it snapping in half. Well that is exactly what happened to mine. While transporting the guitar stand, the thing fell apart as I was folding up the legs! Now if I want to fix it I'm going to need to weld the metal back together, which is too far out of my way.Anyways, verdict is, fretrest by proline was decent until it broke. Now my guitar needs a new stand."
1,Almost useless!,"I was hoping to find detail information about gearbox structure and it's repair, but haven't found anything about it..Contains only some sort of basic information, like ""You car has four wheels, to take one of put it securely on jackstands.. ""Didn't meet my expectations."
1,"battery problems, audio problems","I totally agree with the previous reviewer's comments - i, too, have had a full battery run out in about three minutes during a call. Equally as bad is the noise - it reminds me of early cell phones. the specs on the box look great, but this phone really disappoints."
4,"If you want local channels, find a new dish ...","My only argument about this system is the fact that you can't get local channels without upgrading to a [price] dish and a new [price] LNB (thats just one hurdle). Hmmmmm... DirectTV says that the oval dishes just can't get the local channels (I have seen these dishes get local channels, but unfortuneatley, it's done by hacking the card which is illegal - but it sure makes liars out of DirectTV saying that the limitiation is in the dish). What's also unfortunate is that you probably won't find this out until you've already bought the dish. So I'm letting you know. If you want local channels, It's cheaper to by a [price] system, than upgrade a [price] one. But, I like the DirectTV service and it still gets 4 stars."
1,Do Not Untie This Knot!,"What a hopeless hash of a book. I'll be the first to admit that the conception of the book was undoubtedly clever, and must have taken a good bit of work. But just as it's not possible to make a cake without decent ingredients and it *is* possible to make a horrid cake despite the best ingredients, The Knot Garden turns to compost in this author's hands. The book is a mystery, yet as we near the end of the book, there is no mystery left to solve, and along the way, no Aha! moment. One needn't be clever to figure the thing out-- once the clues are in place, a six year old could untie this unsavory glop. And ultimately, with everything and everyone revealed, there is an overwhelming sense of ""So what?"" for the reader to take home. Rarely have I disliked a book so much that after finishing it the only reasonable thing left to do is throw it in the trash and try to forget ever having read it. This is one such book."
2,Meh...,"I Wrote an In-Depth Review On a Different Deathlok Post. Terrible Figure, Lame Character. Only Got Him for the Galactus Piece. Top Heavy, Can't Support His Own Weight. Could've Used the Base, but then He Wouldn't have the Galactus Piece and No One would've Bought Him..."
5,COOL,WHEN I HEARED THAT TOY BIZ WAS MAKEING A DEATHLOCK I WAS VERY SUPRIZED BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS WHO DEATHLOCK IS. ONCE I GOT HIM I PUT HIM ON MY SHELF AND LOOKED AT HIM FOR A WHILE HE HAS A GREAT PAINT JOB. BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THE GUN WONT STAY ON HIS BACK.
4,too cute,"These are a too cute tire. will make your project look great and price is good also. They look very close to OEM, a nice extra touch for an older bike needing a face lift."
3,Royal Blood Feud is a Good Read,"Back before Diana divorced Charles, the media was informed of all their problems. James Whitaker is a well known royal reporter who pretty much got to the bottom of the story. The book has many little anecdotes that explain the growing unhappiness in the royal marriage of Charles and Di."
2,This was not an enjoyable reading,"Perhaps if I did not read Robert Massie's masterpieces before taking on George III: A Personal History my review would have been less negative. Indeed, Robert Massie's wonderfully engaging biographies of some of Russia's most famous Tzars had raised my expectations from other historical biographies. This was not an enjoyable reading. Hibbert does not seem to be able to tell apart relevant and interesting facts from unnecessary ones. He writes about everything, including the most mundane, trivial and boring aspects of George III's daily live. What a missed opportunity to tell a story that has all the elements of a wonderful and engaging tale."
4,A great plastic bottle ALTERNATIVE,"I searched high and low for a non-plastic water bottle. I looked at Sigg and Kleen Kanteen, but I wasn't happy with their spouts---I like to gulp my water. This Thermos product is great--easy to drink out of and leak proof when the lid is closed; it also keeps drinks cold, which the competitors do not. The only drawbacks are that it doesn't come in a liter size and there isn't a model with a straw. I have the child-size versions, (Foogo), for my kids, which have straws and are great, but I'd like to see a larger adult version with a straw as well. I'm very happy with my purchase."
4,22 oz. hydration thermos,"I purchased two of the smaller hydration bottles, one for at work and one for at home, but they proved to be too small. They do a good job of keeping things cold - I think everyone who purchased this product agrees on that. But I would encourage you to spend a little more and purchase the larger bottle. If you read enough reviews about this thermos, one of the criticisms that repeatedly arises is that sometimes the top seal pops out and gets lost and then the thermos leaks. That is exactly what happened on mine. Why they don't fix that problem is beyond me. Fortunately I found my seal, but I've heard it's either very difficult or impossible to get a replacement seal. That little flaw is why I'm only giving this product four stars. I'll probably expariment with different glues to find the best way to glue the seal in place, and the big problem is finding a glue that is non-toxic, if they even make such a product!"
2,Leaky Water Bottle,I love the thermos stainless steel bottles and have had good luck with them - this bottle however is not up to par. It is huge and bulky and it has started leaking a month after purchase. I am not happy with the general concept - not very easy to lugg around.
3,Can't drink hot drinks from the spout,"For those of you thinking of using this to keep your drinks hot and drink straight from it, I need to tell you that the spout is not designed to drink hot drinks from. It's just like a bottle spout, with no lip around it. You will scald yourself. If you are using it for cold drinks, it should be fine, and I'm sure this thing would keep it cold.Also have to mention that packaging was inadequate, which coupled with UPS abuse, resulted in dents on the stainless steel wall, and a chip on the plastic near the wire clip.I returned this item due to the unsuitability of the design for my purpose, and the dents too."
5,Love it,When I had this it was a great product. It kept my coffee almost too hot and I would highly recommend
3,"Good design, but volume is not loud enough","Just got the phone yesterday and could not wait to try it out. So, after charging enough battery, I have to put it into testing. The design and features of the phone are awesome. The headset is quite comfortable as well. The only down side is the volume is not loud enough. My friends said they cannot hear me that clear and loud neither. Wonder what the problem is. I read a previous review to indicate that hers is very clear and loud. Do you think I need to exchange?"
2,"Great idea, poor implementation","I had the previous version, and returned it. Everyone's comments here seem to indicate the same issues exist, fundamentally poor audio quality.I got the Vtech totally coordless phone after returning the IBM, and it was better but still low quality. It was much more comfortable and audio was tolerable. unique design that does not touch ears is great, very comfortable for extended use. But we wore it out, now looking for something else. Once you have had a phone of this type, you are ruined for life, and never want to go back to anything else. Sigh."
4,She loved it!!!,"There is only one reason why this didnt get a 5 star rating. No butt flap. I dont think its a big deal for her, but at night i like to feel skin when i sleep. Alas now she is warm and well protected. great product, comfortable, and she loves the footies."
5,The best gift to myself EVER!!!!,"I've always wanted a onesie and when I saw this online it was PERFECT!! My best friend and I each bought one in matching colors. I bought a large and when I took it out of the package it looked like it would swallow me. After trying it on, it was a little bigger than I thought, but the extra space is comfortable and isn't as obvious as I expected. To bring in the new year I wore my new onesie ALL DAY :) I love my onesie!!!!"
5,cute cute cute,These are so much better than I expected .....very good qualiety I am very happy with the purchase....these are a gift for my daughter and she loves them
4,Cute affordable and cozy.,Love the pattern and how soft it is. Just runs a bit big. The medium was more like and extra large. Great price though and very cozy
5,Super comfy and warm!,I think the title says it all. I totally recommend them. At first I got them for Halloween (I was going to be Grumpy Care Bear :P) but after that I decided to give them a try as pajamas and just loooooooved them. You don't have to deal with pants rolling up or socks rolling down while you sleep.
5,Very high quality...,"HIGHS: very well made, soft, true to size, priceLOWS: limited color choicesVERDICT: a very comfortable P.J. at a very good price"
3,warm but disappointed,"Coming home to a cold house through 6 month long snowy winters, I like to get out of my dress clothes and slip into warm footie pajamas until the heat in the house sets in! Expecting to also wear socks, long underwear or sweats, I ordered a medium for my 5'6"" average build body, and they are still way too big. These are proportioned for a very large abdomen...needing to be taken in 8"" in the hips and raise the crotch 6"" to fit me more comfortably. They are soft, warm, and the fabric is not too bulky. I like the wrist cuffs and the elastic waist in back, which help keep them from feeling less like wearing a blanket. The other disappointment was the color: ""pink"" is not pastel like the soft baby blue shown in the picture. Instead it is a combination of four Pepto Bismol shades that look like a paintball fatigue. Had I known that ""Women's Guide Gear"" was linked to a hunting site, I would have been more careful when the picture was not displayed."
5,First Grade treasure,I bought this for my son's class and they love to leaf through the pages for long periods of time. Great to pair with picture book.
3,"Good leather, but.....","The case is made of good leather & put together well, but the inside lining was glued on for some reason before sewn together, so the glue rubs off on the phone. Over time, this won't be a problem. The velco cover is strong enough to prevent accidental openings, but the trade off is that it makes the case a little bulky. Lastly the belt clip is insufficient, should've used a belt loop instead. The case came off my belt 3 times already by accident. Luckily the case protected the phone from damage."
2,Buy ICE-30 instead,I bought this one for my W810i and I am really disappointed about this case now.Pros:The phone fits nicely in the case. Looks niceCons:It comes off the belt very easily. Sometimes it comes off even when you take the phone out of the case in a hurry.It makes hell lot of a noise while opening the case.I purchased ICE-30 and i love it
1,"Great technology, but it doesn't work","In setting up the Midland 74210 weather radio, I visited the national weather service web site to find the county code for my home. This would allow the weather radio to be activated only for weather watches and warnings in my area. At the national weather service web site, I found a statement that several users had reported trouble with the Midland 74210 weather radio.I, too, experienced trouble with this product. It is not responding to SAME broadcasts in my area.I also found the user manual to be confusing and unclear. There are several sections of the user manual that have been modified by having printed changes pasted onto the orignal pages. Apparently, the user guide is a work in progress."
5,Security policies and procedures,"Definitely not the book to take to the beach with you, but a good book all the same. The author lays out in a comprehensive way an organization wide process to develop a secure information structure. The insights range from high level strategies, to lower level tactics, with a few very practical examples thrown in here and there.Information security should be a critical concern of today's high-tech organizations. But so often it is forgotten, or relegated into obscurity because there was too much process or the security was too intrusive. The author strikes a good, pragmatic balance between convenience and security here.The book is a short, easy read. Really a must read for CIOs and a should read for CEOs."
1,I have the perfect replacment,"I used this book for my materials characterization undergrad course. Like most text's I used, I found it lacking examples and was outdated. I searched for a better text and came across ""Introduction to Diffraction in Materials Science and Engineering"" by Aaron Krawitz. This text does justice to the topic and I would advise any MSE department to adapt it instead of Cullity."
1,Beware of the battery,"I have had this phone for about 4-5 months. The battery started not holding a charge about a month ago. I stopped by a Good Guys to pick up a new one only to find that a) they didn't carry the battery (though they did carry the phone); and b) ""lots of other people had been asking for the same battery"".I concluded from this, as well as the other reviews, that Panasonic has a problem in this area. I suspect that there may be a heat problem (maybe not monitored properly) with the charger.The reception is not that great; the controls are not that convenient to use, especially the ""joystick"" button. Programming requires the handset, rather than being done entirely from the base (for no good reason that I could tell). The button label are odd and not intuitive.Just not the great phone that it could be."
5,Beautiful,"This cross is very beautiful, but the picture with it is quite magnified. You cannot see all that detail with normal vision. However, I do like it and wear it with dressier outfits."
2,Scratchy old record sound.,"I ordered this cd set for two tracks on disc 2. They were horrible. The sound is like listening to a worn out old record. Faded sound and lots of hiss and pops. If you are ordering this set for disc 1 or 3 it's ok. Not too bad. But disc two is really, really bad."
5,Love it!!!!!,I bought one for a house with low water pressure. It worked out great. I bought a second one and we love that one as well.
1,Longterm not worth it.,I bought the Thunderhead thinking it would be the last showerhead I ever bought. Since the entire product is made of plastic and rubber -- it is supposed to be easy to clear the the hard calcium buildup by pinching the rubber water nipple. Well after less then 2 years more water comes from around those little nipples then come through them. Only a one year warranty -- hardly worth it considering the price. I imagine I could have paid 1/2 as much and needed to clean the head a little but I know the other heads I have used in the past lasted longer then 2 years. Be warned it isn't if you will need to replace the whole thing --- it is only a matter of when you will need to replace it. Steer clear of this -- look for a better warranty at a reduced price.
4,"Excellent, even with modest water pressure available","Wow. I love a strong shower. Despite being a large shower head with a lot of nozzles (so you stay warm and get really wet!), and despite not having great water pressure in my home, this has made showers so much more pleasurable again. Changing nothing else in the plumbing, just the shower head, my showers went from weak to refreshing. And no problem rinsing shampoo or conditioner out of thick hair either.So why not 5 stars? As cheap as plastic fake chrome finishes look, plain white plastic looks cheaper, and this only comes in plain white. It *feels* like a great shower head, which is the most important thing, but let's just say that a decorator would not let you install it.Close your eyes and buy it anyway. Once you feel it, you won't care what it looks like."
1,"Did not work for me, would have given more stars if shipping was refunded","Bought specifically to amp up water pressure as advertised. Did nothing of the sort for my shower, just spread our low pressure over many nozzles with tiny spray streams and it actually really tickled my head and face. They were great about accepting my return request and I'm guessing if I had mega shower pressure this baby would be great, but...then...I wouldn't need to look for a product that is supposed to increase pressure.I wasn't expecting to not get my shipping cost back, since I had to pay 10 bucks to ship it BACK to them, and only got 80 dollars in return instead of the total 89.95 (w/ free shipping) That I paid for it....so for that SNEAKY move (and for it plain not working for me) I give it a one star.It is kinda cheap feeling due to plastic but it really seemed like it was soundly constructed."
2,Too much bragging,Spent too much time bragging about her clients and her accomplishments and too little time offering helpful advice.
1,MADE IN CHINA,"Much lower quality than when it was made in the USA ?? safe. I have bought Armetale for gifts lately and compared to the ones I had, they really looked bad."
5,Gift For My Mum!!!,"Was a gift for my mother,she had been wanting to see it again for years. It was a good as the first time we had seen it."
4,Not Bad Considering Age,Great tunes. Stones at their career peak with the best lead guitarist they've had - Mick Taylor. The video could be a lot better BUT considering it's age it's more than acceptable.
3,"You may not believe it, but they sound much better today","If you're looking at this, you obviously like the Stones, so I won't go into their performance. What I will mention is this film's rendering of those performances. Unfortunately, like so many concert films of this era, both the audio and the visual presentations are pretty bad. The blu ray isn't appreciably better than the DVD."
3,Bad Bass Mix With Dropouts,"Having seen both the tour in 1972 and the movie in 1974, I was very excited to get this film when it came out. I pre-ordered it on DVD and paid a premium (Two Day Shipping) to have it arrive at my house on the day it was released. I have two items about this film that are dissapointing. First, the bass guitar is presented way down in the mix. This wasn't the case in either the film or the house mix during their tour. Second, there are places that the bass spectrum (bass guitar and kick drum) drop out altogether. An example is during Tumbling Dice. I'm hoping this is only a problem on the DVD version. I've purchased the Blue Ray version, hoping their audio mix will be better.Once I get the Blue Ray version, I will be returning either the DVD version or both."
4,Finally we get to see the real Stones,"There's no doubt in anyone's mind that the Stones during the Taylor era were at the top of their game. Despite the fact that he did not write any of their music, Taylor's exquisite guitar playing to complement Keith's great foundation playing, the musicianship took precedence over the theatrics and Jagger's ""one man show"" performance.of the latter Stones. The big gripe I have (I knew it would happen) is the lower volume of Taylor's guitar where you almost have to strain to hear all the details and nuances. Unlike a bootleg cd I have from the same era recorded in Europe, where the master's guitar is loud and up front where it belongs. After all these years of professional jealously, give it a rest Keith. Let the fans enjoy the Stones before they became a caricature of their former selves."
3,Film Quality poor. Content great.,When I finally uncorked this I couldn't believe how bad the film quality is. All the restoration performed on other films yield sometimes great results but not this. This barely has the impact it did on its limited release which I viewed twice in Chicago. It was that good. This is not. A a sound document it is really great. Why not release it in high-res? While you're at it release the studio output in high resolution file form like the Beatles did with the USB Apple.
3,See the boys rockin',"Definitely vintage cinematography, but if you can get past that (which took a little while) the music is great and I loved seeing the YOUNG Stones again,"
5,The Book - Carman The Champion,"If you saw the movie Carman The Champion, you should do yourself a favor and buy this book. It is not just a rehash of the movie you have already seen. The general basis of the plot is very similar, but you will find Carman's presentation different and takes turns in the story you might not expect. After reading the book, I rather wished there was a movie version that used the novel script.The message of faith couldn't be more clear to you or to anyone you might buy the book as a gift. Good witnessing tool. Good reading. Very well written. The people are people with three dimensional personality that you can relate to in real life."
3,routine academic droning,"This is a very academic book, full of footnotes and allusions to other academic writers. It is neither vigorous nor easy to read -- in other words, not what you would hope to find in a book with this title."
4,Not so bad.,"Not a bad movie. Donald Sutherland plays a clumsy, cocky, and abnoxious man. His character ( Jesse ) lives in a scrapyard with some of his friends. He has a love for destroying beautiful cars, and having fun at everyone elses exspence. Fresh out of jail, he is forced by his paroll officer to have a normal life. But he seems determined to live his life on his terms. It's definantly worth checking out."
4,Carolan's biography and music,"This is a very good book for musicians and scholars interested in the ancient Irish harper Turlough O'Carolan. The information about Carolan is limited, and this detracts slightly from the biographical portion. To be honest, however, other biographies have prejudiced our thinking. Current writing has trained us into thinking that the writer must give a complete portrait and life story. This just isn't available due to limited records. What is presented is good. Just as important is that all of the 200+ melodies attributed to Carolan are included. This is a treasure for musicians, especially harpers. It also gives some background on many of the pieces (the ""planxies""). A good book."
1,13 hours,This phone was in our house for 13 hours. That's only because of the initial 12 hour charging requirement. It's now back at the store and my money back in my pocket.
1,Expected more from IBM.,"There is no way to turn off auto-answer. If the phone is in the cradle when it rings, you have to pick it up to see the caller ID. When you pick it up, it answers the phone automatically making caller ID useless.Sound quality, both receiving and sending is very poor. Makes me think I am using a cheap cell phone. Have used $9 phones that sounded better.Invest your money in a different brand."
5,Nice Book - In-depth look at horse racing and history behind Secretariat,"I received my book in a timely manner. The book was well and safely packaged.An in-depth look at horse racing and history behind Secretariat and his forefathers and mothers. If you like horses and horse racing, you will like this book."
3,I like it,"I like this book, its a good read. All though it definitely has some inappropriate horse content, and I don't recommend it for children under 13. Other than that this is an ok book and tells you the story of the triple crown runner-SECRETARIAT- :-)"
3,good text,"Very comprehensive book of Claiborne farms, the family, and Secretariat, as well as the triple crown races. However, pictures would have made this book complete and it's severly lacking in that area."
3,Movie MUCH BETTER than book,"This book tells the story of Secretariat with lots of racing stats and facts but it came up short on getting you personally involved in the story. Too bad the author does not have the flare for writing that Laura Hillenbrand has! With her skill she would have made Secretariat come alive for those who never had the privilege of meeting him or seeing him race. For example, Nack's description of the 1973 Belmont consists primarily of reciting the times Big Red was reeling off for each quarter. If Nack was at a loss for how to describe the excitement and the emotions of that race, perhaps he could have described Ron Turcotte's feelings as he experienced a ride like no one else has ever taken. I really wish Hillenbrand could have written this book. She could have done Big Red justice. The movie is MUCH BETTER."
1,BAD PRODUCT/BAD SERVICE,"I bought this product in January. It started humming in July. By the beginning of August it was humming and kept shutting itself on and off. A few weeks later, it was dead.The company claimed they would replace it but for [money] and I would receive it in 10 days. 6 weeks later, after calling the company several times, they finally tell me they no longer have it in stock. They say I need to pay [money] to get it fixed and that it takes 2 weeks. I don't trust them.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
3,Esta Bien pero pasa por desapercibido,"mmm es un perfume para uso casual y diario, no recibi ningun comentario al respecto de el, pero a mi si me gusta."
2,Too Much Information,"If you are a hardcore Simpson fan, you might like the way this book approaches the Simpsons. Although I like reading Simpson's comics and watching the TV show, I found this book extremely boring with too much facts and information that maybe funny at first. None the less, it is a book you cannot sit down and just read. I couldn't stand reading past the first 20 pages. I would not recommend this one, but get another of the Simpson comics."
5,Clearly Simpsons material,"If you love the simpsons and almost never miss a show +enjoy watching the same episode over a few times this is your book.It has fuuuunnnyy simpsons songs,what bart writes on the chalkboard,funny thing s you might have missed,a tribute to Troy Mclure,funny lines from each episode FROM THE NINTH AND TENTH SEASONS,and the plot from each episode.As the comic book guy would say(best book ever)I suggest you buy it it's clearly worth the $."
5,Simpsons Fans Rejoice!,"This is a great book and a ""must buy"" for anyone who loves the Simpsons. I'm one of those people who records Simpsons episodes and watches them over and over again for hidden jokes that I missed. This book (as well as its predecessor) proved to me that there were still many jokes/tidbits that I missed, despite my narcissistic habit of watching episodes to death. Buy it and enjoy!"
1,Restores one's faith in Democracy,"Reading this poorly-written, but extememly angry book, I feel a new respect for the Senators who so decisively rejected Bork as a Supreme Court Justice. The book is a series of random rants on various topics where Judge Bork gets to demonstrate his complete ignorance of life as it is actually lived in America.Bork blames Liberalism for the rising tide of crime and illegitimate birth that threaten to engulf our society. On Planet Bork this may be true, but on Planet Earth, he wrote thes words while were experiencing the most dramatic 8-year decline in both crime and illegitimacy in the nations history. It takes a mighty arrogance and an invincible ignorance to be so dramatically wrong."
5,An excellent presentation about how we got where we are,The book is well written. It will be a challenge for anyone that already knows how we got where we are today as it presents a view supported with facts that is not seen in the popular press. Should be a must read for all that wish to be well informed. A real eye opener.
5,I never got my book,My book was shipped to my old address and it has yet to be sent to me. Neither Amazon or the apartment where the book was shipped will help. I was also told I cannot get my money back. I will buy this again but from another source.
4,serenity,"love the tv series and and movie, the comic is shorter than i expected however highly enjoyable the story style suits comics"
3,Not enough and flimsy at that...,"The illustrations are good. I'll give it that. And the overall story is not bad. But the strength of ""Firefly"" was never from the story but the characters and those who played them. I simply didn't think this gave the characters enough ""screen time"" to play out the story. It's too short. Perhaps the meat of what happens between the final episode of Firefly and Serentity is still a movie /tv show in the making... but this graphic novel does it little justice and seems more of a teaser. Particularly tantalizing as no one seems to know whether this material will ever be made into a movie/ tv program.Regardless, as one other reviewer pointed out, if you're a ""Firefly"" fan it doesn't hurt to have it."
4,Graphic novel does hold its own,"Having fallen head over heels in love with the Firefly/Serenity 'verse, I naturally had to buy every book/DVD I could find. Despite the luke-warm reviews of this item, I went for it and was very pleasantly surprised. The art is utterly first rate. The dialogue is very typically Firefly. Both art and writing capture the personalities of the characters. I found the exploration of Mal's inner emotions via subtle facial expression to be most excellent. Perhaps the plotline leaves something to be desired compared to the best of the Firefly episodes, yet it does a fine job in wrapping up a few issues and introducing new ones pre-Serenity."
3,Not Great But Decent,"This arrived yesterday and I just finished reading it. I found the story decent--in one place I laughed and in one place I got a bit choked up--but for the most part it just couldn't capture the full range of humor, drama and action that Joss Whedon and the actors conveyed so vibrantly in the Firefly series and Serenity film. If you're a Firefly fan like I am (and if you're not your loved one is and) you're going to buy it anyway, so just be forewarned: it's better than A Shepherd's Tale, but not nearly as good a the series and film. :-)"
2,Disappointing,"No one is a bigger Joss Whedon fan than me, but I found the 3 graphic novels that supposedly bridge the gap between Firefly and Serenity very disappointing.First of all there is very little story there. The men with ""hands of blue"" are conveniently wiped out, but this feels contrived to me. In the end I still didn't understand why Book left the ship."
4,fills in gaps between series and movie,"I'm not a fan of graphic novels or comics, so I can't really judge this as an example of that sort of art form, but I was glad to have the extra story filled in between the series and the movie. To me, definitely worth having for that reason alone."
2,A Poor Communication Device,"I bought this phone for my father, 88 years old. He has a hard time while using it in his apartment. The reception is very poor - inconsistent and with interference, even when he is using the channel selection feature. It appears that electronic design of the phone has flaws."
2,Ouch,"I have owned this model in the past (loved it) and recently bought a new one. This one actually cuts skin, even with the protective guard on it. I don't know if I got a lemon or they changed the mechanics of it. I would not get this one unless you enjoy cutting into your private parts!"
5,Absolutely top rate,One of the highest-quality electrical products I have ever used. Totally eliminates power worries for all-day still and video photography shoots. Holds charge remarkably well. A must for any outdoor digital photographer.
2,"If you loved Dragronsbane, this will be a brutal letdown","This book ends on a such note of emotional and personal loss and desolation that my first thought was to hope Ms. Hambly's personal life has not taken a turn for the worse. John and Jenny, in Dragonsbane, had one of the best relationships of any literary couple. They were obviously and deeply in love and Ms. Hambly showed that in a skilled and detailed way that always made me want to meet the ""John"" in her life. At the end of Dragonshadow the relationship is in ruins and there seems little hope for them. Perhaps the promised sequel will salvage something from the wreckage. Dragonshadow, well-written though it is, seems a cruel thing to do to loyal readers in the name of art."
5,Wrenching and wonderful,"I'll admit right off the bat, I am a very big fan of Hambly's works. I'd probably buy the telephone book if she re-wrote it. So I bought 'Dragonshadow', and I loved it . . . but it was horrible to read what she put these folks through. I adored 'Dragonslayer', and I love the characters of Jenny, John, and Morkeleb, and she puts them all through the wringer in this one. Jenny in particular. By the end there is hardly a gleam of hope showing, and the note on the last page about the sequel was the best thing I had read in chapters.The writing, characterization, and description are all up to Hambly's usual brilliance. It's a definate buy; but you may want to wait to read it until the sequel is out, and you can read them together!"
1,Half a book,"The first book in the series, Dragonsbane, was pretty good. And Ms Hambly generally writes a good book. But, in Dragonshadow, she wrote half a book. Dragonshadow has no ending, and it closes with a notice that it is continued in the next book of the series (Trilogy?). Dragonshadow is depressing. It is, sadly, a book for those who wish to wallow in the filth and misery of demons, those who wish to read of the triumph of evil.... I do hope that Ms Hambly does better in the future. Or she gets dropped from my list of preferred authors."
2,Disappointing and predictable,"I loved Dragonsbane and when I found out about this sequel, I rushed to get it. But I was disappointed by the story -- it was predictable, left me with so many questions about the motives of the characters, confusing, and just made me wish I had not read it."
2,Disappointing sequel,This is the first Barbara Hambly book that I've found disappointing. Maybe my expectations were too high because I loved Dragonsbane and everything else that she has written. I couldn't believe that a sequel had snuck out without my hearing about it. Now I wish that I hadn't seen it either. I guess that she was due...
1,Should be titled Hidden Stories,"For a 200 page book, there are amazingly few actual stories. Those that are told, are drawn out to excrutiating lengths. It seemed to me that the author was just trying to take up space going over insignificant details ad nauseum."
4,A sequel worth reading,"If you and your child are already fans of this gentle series, ""Downtown"" is certainly worth reading and enjoying. The main plot, which involves an orphan Italian boy and requires a series of coincidences that strain belief, is not as realistic or strong as in the earlier novels, but the characters are still winning and the historical details, fascinating. We call ""All-of-a-Kind Family"" the equivalent of the ""Little House"" books for children whose ancestors went through Ellis Island, and like the ""Little House"" books, their appeal is timeless."
5,Food for thought,"After reading this fine book, I am still mulling over the actions of the author. She was offered the world on a platter, and chose to reject love and make her own way in life. She would be a most interesting person to met and conversed with. After reading a biography about Mile Franklin, I believe she did the right thing.A beautiful read.The book still haunts me several days after reading. Assuming the story is more fact than fiction, I propose a motive for the author's actions.The book may have been the 19 century coming out story, which went over peoples heads at the time, and even now. I believe the author was attracted to women. She mentioned several times how she detested the touch of a man, and turned down a marriage proposal that would be most woman's dream. She often lamented on how different she was from other girls. She never married.I suspect the book was written a 100 years before its time, about a subject that was simply taboo.Durgan."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I got this radio less than a year ago, and I'm replacing it because I can't keep the batteries charged. The thing is ALWAYS hot, and after the first 6 months of having it, it won't pick up our NOAA stations and give us alerts anymore. And, the range on it is pitiful. I live on a farm at least 7 miles away from any tornado sirens, so it's VERY important that my family is protected from bad weather. I don't feel safe with this product in my home. I bought it because I thought it would be great to have a portable that can go to the basement with us, but the batteries kept dying. Take my word for it, FIND A BETTER PRODUCT!"
1,Who wrote the users manual,Programming this radio is very difficult. There is nothing logical about this process or the manual. Turning off the alarm functions are even more confusing and I'm not sure why they are even included. Battery life is very poor. Even though the batteries are rechargable the maximum life is two days. To make matters worse once the batteries discharge you have to reprogram the radio and don't loose the manual you won't get too far without it.
5,Works perfectly,"I was worried this wouldn't fit the Dunkin Donuts bagels, ut it does! It cuts evenly & it is very easy to clean."
1,bagel cutter,"I am quite disappointed with this product. It sticks to the bagel and makes it very difficult to cut. Also, it is very difficult to clean. My son-in-law won't use it any more and wants me to send this back."
2,worked OK for 12 months but now useless,"We already had to replace the battery once, but this time it doesn't seem to make any difference, the phone just dies within a minute or two of taking it off the cradle.Perhaps there is a way to fix this. However from reading other reviews it seems that many portable phones are not designed to last more than a year or two so I'm not optimistic."
4,5.1 Headphones,"Pros:The headphones are really good for gaming. You can hear things from all around you and tell where footsteps are coming from. So, if you're just looking to play games with them they're awesome. Another plus is that I don't think you could buy a better mic. It's perfectly clear.Con:For sound quality though, music sounds a little like it's being played in a tin can. It lacks a good bass.Overall I'm happy with the purchase, they serve the purpose I got them for and were a fairly cheap solution."
5,"Headset is good, converter is great !!!",I bought this item for one reason : its optical to 5.1 converter.I already have such 5.1 headsets but it didn't give me the chance to connect my bluray player using the optical connector (and the basic stereo is useless to me).Now i can enjoy the great sound of my Avatar Bluray and feel the deep bass and the 5.1 effect at any time without waking my 6 month old little baby.Great material
1,Piece of JUNK!!!,"I have to admit that these headphones look nice. However, up to this point i have not been able to connect them to any equipment. They simply dont have the connections to the XBOX 360. They offer no information at all."
2,Where is Imani?,"Like many other readers, I would guess, I read this book because I loved ""What Seems Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day"", and what made that book so special was Ava's personality. OK, so her sister Joyce is different. Why not. But this book has the taste of so many other sequels - never as good as the first one. However, I felt cheated. Foul play, Ms. Cleage! You can't take us back to Idlewild and pretend that Ava, Eddie and especially Imani never existed. Why not make up a whole new character and place then? I haven't finished the book yet, have about a third left to go, but it is already too late, I've already spent too much time waiting for Imani and Ava to show up. There isn't even an explanation as to what happened to them, nothing. That's called cheating in my book."
5,It's Time to Buy a Red Dress!,"What a beautiful follow up to Cleage's book ""What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day"". In ""I Wish I Had a Red Dress"" we get a chance to get to know more about the character Joyce. She teaches young people how to help themselves; while learning more about herself. As readers we learn that as ""free women"", we can have safety in love of ourselves as well as of others.Read this book ... and enjoy that red dress!"
2,I Wasn't Feeling It,"Maybe it's just me. I thought I'd try out a Cleage novel since i hear so much hype about her book. I was tossed back and forth and couldn't make heads or tails out of the gist of the book. I know that she met this handsome principal and fell in love and that she lost her husband and children in car accident. Then she started a nonprofit agency called the Sewing Circus for women with issues. Where's the connection?Sorry. Even though this is only my second review on amazon, I tried to get in this sotry and like this book but it was'nt happenin' for me. Others may like it, but its not my kind of novel. After saying that, i won't elaborate any further. Maybe i will try her other book ?What looks like crazy...Sweetie Pye(Yes, this is my REAL name)"
1,Dont Buy,"I bought the product, and the drivers were detected and installed instantly, But it would not mount, so I read their user manuals and tried reinstalling the drivers many times, I Emailed for tech support and they were no help, I emailed them back and forth for a week, and it ended in them telling me things that didn't work then saying that i tampered with the product. At that point I was not happy I found A lot of people on the internet have the same problem. My advice, Do not buy this product."
1,Terrible,"I bought the product, and the drivers were detected and installed instantly, But it would not mount, so I read their user manuals and tried reinstalling the drivers many times, I Emailed for tech support and they were no help, I emailed them back and forth for a week, and it ended in them telling me things that didn't work then saying that i tampered with the product. At that point I was not happy I found A lot of people on the internet have the same problem. My advice, Do not buy this product."
4,Does the job.,"I bought this to switch the HDMI signals from 3 inputs and send them to the HDTV. You have tha ability to extract the audio for use in the surrrond system with out the extra cables from the input devices and HDTV to the reciever. This gets the job done nicely without all of the extra cables. The instruction manual was good, but not great."
2,Good for Bs and three washes!,"I got this for my birthday last year (2008). I was so excited I should have known it was too good to be true. As previously stated Cs and Ds don't fit and come out looking like something you might pull out of a clogged shower drain. After losing ten pounds (apparently all from my chest) I can state that Bs fit perfectly in the Bra Baby although, A cup bras do not. On the third wash the tiny plastic closure came off and cannot be found. I have called customer service several times with no luck. I have however received tens of detergent samples and coupons. If you are a B cup and use the gentle cycle with a semi-fill washer this thing is God's gift to your breasts. Lighter loads or larger/ smaller cups leave you out fifteen bucks, braless, and with more useless crap on top of your washer."
4,Cheap but works,"Its' cheap but looks great. The clasp is very weak and cheap but you can ""Gerry-rig"" something to make it work. For the price you can't beat the look. Sexy!"
3,"Many Intersting Facts, Yet as a Whole Almost Dull","A more complete story of the London Plague is probably not available. But the character's stories of survival, heroism, charity and cowardness are fractured; here their stories are begun, dropped, begun again without a clear feeling that the story should have been dropped. It seems almost in mid-thought that the authors decide to go on to something that suddenly catches their interest without regard that the reader wants a more convincing reason, or better understanding as to why the subject has been changed.The Epilogue is a different matter. Clear, concise, flowing well, a steady exposition of the bacterial infection (a flea from a black rat) how it evolved and changed over time. The theory of why it has not returned is compelling and persuasive. It is interesting. The style used here would, if used throughout the book, have improved it immensely."
5,Excellent documentation,The authors use the diaries legal documents of the age to paint a vivid picture of London's Great Plague of 1665. Much easier to read than many non-fiction treatments because of the use of people rather than raw facts to tell the story. Recommended.
2,Not meant to be full,Cheaply attached handle. They broke off in the first week. The net covering the top is senseless. I had to cut it.
2,"Worked well, died after warranty expired","Fryer worked very well for about a year, a few weeks after the warranty expired it now shows error code ""EH"" and unit won't function. Unit was inexpensive so it's not worth repairing."
4,fryer,only goes to 375. also if u have a full load is cools the grease very quickly. i do enjoy it very much!
4,timer issue,"I really truly love this thing. It's larger than most, which is fantastic. Basket options are great. My only problem thus far has been using the timer.... when the 2-3 minutes is up on the timer, the fryer shuts off. It was a bit of a hassle. I just don't use the fryers timer anymore."
4,Deep fryer,Works well. Just make sure you really want one this big. I wish I had bought a smaller one due to the amount of oil required in one this size.
5,A dark but great read,"Mr. Wynne appears to have a knack for writing military / paramilitary fiction that's both technically accurate and a great story.Other reviews do a great job of discussing the plot, so I won't re-hash that. I will say that I saw each of the characters as real people, and had no problem getting sucked into the story. It's a dark subject, but that's part of what makes it so interesting.If you enjoy military fiction / thrillers, this is a must read."
5,Great Thriller,Great read!!! The action is non-stop!! The characters are well developed. You can almost feel Dale's pain as he tracts his best friend!!! Loved it!!!
3,No Other Option,"Interesting start, but fails to follow through. Special government people are presented as incompentant. Regular police are also presented as over zealous and stupid. The main character is supposed to be sharp and very alert, but pulls a few too many stupid actions. Average reading, may have some insight into the minds of some law enforcement people. Okay reading if you are waiting for an doctor appointment or something to kill the time."
5,High Quality military/police thriller. Breathtaking stuff.,"SpecFor man gone mad. Every militaries nightmare. What happens when a highly trained assassin loses the plot and goes 'bad'. Jonny Maxwell, just such a soldier, a member of a very elite SpecFor group has been jailed for a large number of rapes. He escapes jail, leaving dead guards in his wake, and we follow his rampage through the Midwest of the USA, corpses left scattered everywhere, as ghe authorities bring Jonny's military colleague Dale Miller to assist the police efforts to recapture the convict.The book weaves its compelling tale around the friendship that was enjoyed by Dale and Jonny, by Dale's intimate knowledge of Jonny's methods, and and throws in the detruction of more policemen than exist in many small towns, a few criminals, a few houses and cars.This book would be the ideal basis for a film to beat Lethal Weapon. Astoundingly believable plots and characters.Breathtaking!!"
4,Jeeves & Wooster-whole series,This is great fun to watch. Each episode is 45 - 60 mins. Wodehouse has a wicked sense of humor!! These two actors are perfect for the parts!!
5,The Ultimate (albeit complete) Set of Jeeves/Wooster,"This is one of the few sets that I have ever 'pined' for! Bertie and the smooth, wry, indomitable Jeeves will ALWAYS be this good!! The first two dvds are a tad slow and uneven; as they stumbled a bit; finally finding the perfect cast and proceeding to produce some of the very best British comedy/satire around. And what a wonderful author Wodehouse is."
5,Great Series,"I have given this to all my siblings and my children. I love PG Wodehouses stores, except the Jeeves and Wooster stories. In my opinion, this is far and away the best way to experience these clever stories."
3,Mediocre DVD Quality . .,Totally delightful series - we all know that:) - but the quality of DVD image is very disappointing - not totally awful: you just know it could be so much better!
5,A Tribute to the Works of Wodehouse,Fans of the books will love this DVD set. The adaptation was done well and provides the true flavor of Wodehouse in a visual medium. If you haven't read the books or just don't like to read - this is your opportunity to see what the rest of enjoy about the writings of Wodehouse.
5,All Jeeves & Wooster fun in one box!,I love the series and was happy to buy it in one box and cancel my Netflix DVD subscription finally!
3,Like the books the first ones are excellent then it becomes tedious,"...the New York stuff just seems to repeat itself over and over. Fry and Laurie are very very good, has to be said. gets 3 from me because I love Woodhouse and this is a great adaptation but probably a few series too far."
5,Another Great BritCom,I enjoyed all of the Jeeves and Wooster which were shown on PBS. I am not sure they showed them all and I could not watch whenever I wanted. Now I can experience a Jeeves and Wooster marathon (without pledge breaks) whenever I want.
5,Even Better than I Remembered from PBS,"Why is Hugh Laurie wasting his time doing American television? Oh yeah-- the money. It's too bad the BBC can't pay him what Hollywood can. Instead of his brilliant performances on House, we'd get his ABSOLUTELY AMAZING performances in shows like this one. Luckily, Stephen Fry still hasn't been lured across the pond. To see some of the best work either of these fellows ever did, and to witness one of history's greatest comedy duos performing some of history's greatest comedy, check out this series."
3,Out of date.,"Keep looking as there are better books out there. The material seems a bit dated. I gave it to me local thrift store, and bought ""The Best Book of Sharks"" instead."
1,The God of the Machine,"Most of the book is incoherent bable .Patterson is against collectivism and communism because they are non productive as one either has to obtain permssion or is forced to do something . He champions private ownership beacuse the individualhas unrestrained ability to be productive .He does not address how private property came into existince only how it functions . The settlement of the Americas provides a good example .Assuming that America was uninhabited by humans .If a European was living in a wild state ( unowened property ) and obtainedthe materials to build a boat to discover America could he claim it as being hisand thus creating private property . In most cases , exploration was funded by royalty and any discoveries were claimed by them creating private propertybut by what justification ?"
2,God of the Machine by Isabel Patterson,"I was diappointed in the book, as it was not what I expected it to be after reading some brief excerpts in an anthology. There is too much historical theory, which seemed to me a lot of bobbledy-gook, and not enough libertarian philosophy."
4,Very cute puzzle,"I purchased this for my 3-year-old daughter. I love the puzzle...the pieces are very sturdy and should wear well. My only complaint is that the figures on the carousel don't stay attached to the carousel base. They fall off every time you turn it, unless you press down hard when turning."
4,Four Freshmen - Today Is Tomorrow,1968 - Liberty RecordsSongs Include :Walk On ByWhen School Is Out This YearGirlsCome Fly With Me / Up Up And AwayHere's To YouWill You Love Me TomorrowDaydreamSoul Coaxing If You Loved MeYou've Got To Be LovedCherish / WindyLady MadonnaMy Girl
2,Might not need this!,"Great quality.I bought this along with the deep socket version.I only needed the deep socket, to remove the oil sending unit."
4,Great Product,"If you're just starting out, this is a great DVD to show you some simple, but impressive tricks."
4,quick charge but also quick discharge,I use this battery with my P910 and it charges to full in a relative short time but this phone drains it too quick. It's a shame there aren't more high capacity batteries for this kind of products. But overall it's a genuine battery that you can buy with confidence.
3,End of the sixties lalaland,"So what happened to all the hippies, the flower children, the drugs, sex and rock and roll, the whole lalaland of the sixties ?It got beaten, stomped on and eaten by the dark forces of the US government.Pynchon details the birth and short lived workers' leftish political movement in California immediately post WW2, these activists becoming the parents of the hippies generation. Then the shady deals, the DEA / FBI / CIA and all the other 3 letters agencies involvement, infiltration and eventual destruction of these naive kids. The sold-out of their ideas and ideals and the sad, pathetic outcomes of these people as they age. Multiple stories run in parallel, some without any clear connection to the main plot - but hey - that's Pynchon.Funny, erudite, politically charged, enigmatic at times, Pynchon no doubt, but as others mentioned before, not his best work."
1,UNREADABLE!,"SORRY TO SAY, BUT THIS BOOK WAS A REAL BORE. I COULD NOT STAY WITH IT. OVER MY HEAD? COULD BE. I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH IT.."
4,A privilege to watch and experience...,"I'm a fairly new Opeth fan, so I wasn't sure what to expect from a concert DVD, but it's nothing short of a stunningly precise and passionate performance by some very talented musicians. For anyone who is familiar with their music, the first half is pretty mellow since it includes the performance of Damnation in its entirety. By most accounts that particular album is an anomaly in that it doesn't include anything even remotely like death metal (that's not really a good way to categorize them anyway, they're too progressive and unique to be labeled anything but Opeth). For longtime fans of what Opeth are known for (extended bone crunching assaults), the second half more than makes up for it. This is one of those rare concerts that can be enjoyed over and over again because you'll always pick up a little something you didn't catch before. I believe Opeth have a long productive future ahead of them and hope there are more DVDs like this included in it."
3,Opeth is a great band who puts on a great live show,"But what is the deal with this DVD? For those of you who are going to be listening to this DVD in Standard 2.0 Stereo, disregard my 3 star rating, it gets a 5 star rating for you guys, But for those of us with 5.1 Surround Sound set-ups, the 3 stars stand. THE DVD IS MIXED IN 5.0! I am completely clueless as to why they didn't mix in a track for the subwoofer, but it sounds absolutly ridiculous without it. You can hardly hear the kick drum or the bass player, which is a damn shame because Pedro Lopez's double-kick speed (and accuracy) is intimidating. Other than the horrible mixing job and the fact that they don't play any songs from albums prior to Blackwater Park (for legal reasons), this DVD is great. I just can't figure out why it's mixed the way it is."
1,Terrible,La versión menos inspiradora de la historia del cine.Los personajes dan grima en vez de inspirar ternura.Y no es xq sea antigua.
1,Pages missing from this book and no help from Amazon,"I ordered this book as a Christmas present, only to find out after giving it that it was missing pp. 113-127. I contacted Amazon to resolve the issue, and the Amazon representative offered to send a replacement. I asked if the replacement could be checked to make sure it had all the pages, and the rep said she would check the replacement before sending it to make sure it had all pages. After 2 weeks, I still hadn't heard back from the rep, so I contacted customer service again. The rep at that time said she would have someone contact me. AGAIN, another week has passed, and I've heard NOTHING."
1,DEDICATED TO SEQUELS BUT NOT THESE ANYMORE,"I have to say that I was excited about reading the third installment because I was a not too happy with the second one and thought that the third was a charm. But, please... There was a good start and then total confusion. Like 40 designers before her and what??? tell me. And all I could say as I read on about this new person, and sister and brother, and Goodfeather, was what the hell happened to this story. It was like someone changed the channel on me. I did not understand the last of the book and I want to say, it stunk."
1,Close call!,"I took my 10 year old cat in to the vet today for his yearly check up. Turns out my cat is the picture of health, but needs to drop about 2 pounds. The vet recommended I switch my cat over to this cat food. I checked it out at the store, but after reading the ingredients I thought this can't be right. First, its labeled for cats up to 6 years old, second it appears to be jammed will fillers, and third, its rather pricey. I'm glad I came home and started researching this product and reading about others experiences with this food, and I'm definitely not feeding this stuff to my cat!"
2,um......,"Okay, I admit, this song has some creative aspects but it does not make much sense. As with Looking for Gloria, the song leaves you with the question ""What was this about? What does it mean?"" And what's all the ""wheeeee""-ing at the end? That really doesn't fit in with the song. Overall, not that great."
3,Color misrepresented,Overall the set is good quality for price. The set is a brighter gold than displayed on the website. If you do not like gold these are not the towels for you.
1,Don't waste your money,You can learn more off the internet than what's in this book. The premise is basically make up your own stardrive and call it a day. The stuff in this book is fluff. Sorry Ben Bova !
5,A new David Ball fan,"This is a great CD. Forget about any of the ""one"" ratings out there (""it's too country""??? I don't get that - go listen to Faith or some of the other singers on adult contemporary radio).There is no song on it that is not at least good. Most of you who have got here already know the excellent Private Malone song. But there is so much more. This album is real smooth and swing permeates throughout.Amigo - The opening song caught me right from the beginning.Linger Awhile - swings the most on the album (Count Basie song)Texas Echo - I'm not a big fan of yodeling, but this song is beautiful and has a great melody.There isn't a song on the album that I didn't like.Enjoy."
5,"Before you hate country, please listen to the track No.4","For most country fans it sounds too usual but ""Riding With Private Malone"" is the most reason I've given five stars.Whoever listen to the song would be pulled into a microcosm of this song with a magic touch, where there is a small service station alongside a dusty two lane blacktop in a small Texan town. And a '66 Corvair, a time machine from a man's shattered dream. After you've got to know the song, you'll find yourself getting a key to drive for a while under the stars in your Corolla or Saturn but blasting those good old songs from a local oldies station on the radio. Of course there are other treasures like cute ""She Always Talked About Mexico"" and yodels or honky-tonks so melodic. You can't judge an album or an artist only by the genre."
3,Good fun,"This is a pretty good entry in the trivia book field.The facts are diverse, interesting, and seemingly well researched. And, of course, completely useless, as the subtitle promises.The entries vary in length from a single sentence to about a half-page. The writing is matter-of-fact, which is a nice change from trivia books that try to dress up the information with lots of breathless adjectives and exclamation points.The internet has made any trivia book an artifact of the 20th century, but this is a nice representative of the genre."
5,Probably Sandra Scofield's best book to date.,"I was riveted by this book. The depths of the characters, the seamless storytelling and the immense human quality is gripping. The intristices between women, between mother and daughter is eloquent. Read this book, it's excellent."
4,Be Careful!!!!,This toy broke easily when i got him out of his package. His missle launcher on his shoulder came off and I had to super glue it back on. Now I can't move this figure around much. BE CAREFUL.
4,-is it spring yet?,"song #1: a feather: an obstructed view____a slow ice cube, wet#2 catching a glimpse of the billowing curtains from the brownstone next door: you run outside, barefoot__wetpicking up the morning paper: he/she is there, closed umbrella in hand-over the shoulder: your first glimpse at the daily news.(hint *press repeat, sit in the window sill and use your finger to trace the rain) ____don't even bother to put on your shoes__is it spring yet?::beautiful. I never expected so much vocal innocence from a man deemed experienced and boastful in many worlds. A renaissance man will always have his foes, as well as any other Talent. This sweet sound gives me hope for pure, dare i say: uncorrupeted love. -at least it helps me sleep at night. Four stars for the unfearing artist and his proclamation at love,ms. diamond*ps: my jacket smelled of parfume, did yours?"
2,rather amateur,"I wanted to like this album, but I don't. Its very intimate, like lovesick teenager playing around with an 8-track in his bedroom. But really, Gallo takes himself too seriously. Pity, I love his films, though. Very talented man."
1,music note is backwards,"The flag on a 8th note is supposed to go to the right, not to the left, I did not notice this at first because in the mirror it looks right, but one of my musician friends pointed it out then I felt like an idiot, which is too bad, because I loved these earrings, but now I feel stupid wearing them knowing that the flag is pointing in the wrong direction."
1,Flawed Design,"We purchased the player to use in the car for a trip cross-country with our two young children. It worked fine for a while but gradually began to fail and finally stopped working altogether. We had to make a lot of phone calls and argue with RCA to get a replacement unit. When we finally received the replacement unit it did not work at all!! RCA knows the unit has problems and they are in the process of a re-design. We are getting our money back and plan to buy a different brand. Bottom line, the current RCA design is immature. Buyer beware."
2,no power,"Although the rca 5400p has some nice advantages, one major dissadvantage is that there is no adaptor for power other than the battery or the wall plug in. i.e. forget watching more than one movie on trips. Rca at this time doesn't make an a/c adaptor for this unit and doesn't plan to. I've tried 3 different power sources (2 different cigarrette adaptors and 1 power inverter) no luck.Another problem is that the unit gets extremely hot and starts effecting the movie about 3/4 the way through it. you have to stop the movie and let the unit cool down. If I could return it I would and get something else. There's nothing portable about this unit."
5,A Wonderful Book About Ancient Greece,"This book, now out of print (but available used), is a beautiful read about ancient Greece. It weaves together the history, the politics, the philosophy, the religion, and the art, of this extraordinary civilization. It should be re-released. (Barr also wrote an excellent companion book, 'The Mask of Jove', about the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity.)"
1,"RCA F32715 32"" TV",I got this TV from rca as a exchange because I was having problems with my other rca TV and now they sent me this TV it is bran new and the same day I get it I start having problems with it the problem is when I shut the TV off there is a static noise from the back of the TV. If I was you don't by a rca TV go with a different company another thing about there company is you try to talk to some one in there office about the TV to have the problem fixed they keep making up excuse and they just tell you anything THINK BEFORE YOU BUY
4,Great intro into Cryptography,"This book was excellent for getting you over that hill of understanding. If you don't have much back ground in cryptography or don't need to know the nitty-gritty details of how it all works then this is the book for you. The book is well indexed and fairly up to date. The only problem I found with this book is that sometimes it went back over some things already covered but, this is a minor issue. I used it extensively for doing an intro research paper on cryptography."
5,treat yourself to timeless treasure...,"""Your Window"" is like a musical. It seems to be a miniseries event of love found and lost and the triump over the process...Heavy rock at times but mostly easy alternative rock sounds come over the waves of rhythm that generate the kind of excitement groups like the Beatles received and still do. First time listening to this cd I remember thinking, ""One cool song after another.""This brilliant offering to the musical world will also stand the test of listening time with its timeless lyrics and harmonious mixes.A MUST HAVE."
4,United States Geography,"I plan to use this atlas in teaching United States geography to 6-12 year olds who are being home schooled. We will study the states in the order in which each area became a state. In the atlas the abbreviations of the states are shown in the names by capital letters, which I find very helpful in teaching the abbreviations, which I think the children should learn. At the end of the year I will be able to give a much better review of the atlas, but at this point this atlas fits very well into my curriculum."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this expecting simple maps that my daughter could use to track the routes we were driving. Well, it's simplistic all right. It doesn't mark many of the cities we drive through. It is more of a car activity book. It's got puzzles and games to keep children busy, but its maps are more like general overviews of the states. For children younger than seven, this is probably good. Older children would most likely prefer a real road atlas with all the roads and cities marked."
4,hard but rewarding read,"It Will Never Happen to Me is a book about the children of alcoholics. This book was not hard to read in terms of language, but instead subject matter. It was hard to read her straightforward insights without feeling pain. I related so much to the various roles she describes children of alcoholics as typically falling into. This book is great if you're looking for stories about people going through the same things you've gone through. However, it doesn't offer a lot of help in terms of moving on."
4,I learned a lot from this book.,I learned a lot from this book. It's not often that a technical book is also readable (some parts more than others). I agree that a different title would be better.It represents an archive of Smalltalk circa 1996. We used the HTTP server code on our project. The book has information in it that couldn't be found anywhere else.
3,"Great lipgloss, Not a great plumper","First off, if you want your lips plumped, go get injections. They work immediately, trust me.This lip ""plumper"" however does not plump my lips. It does however have a pleasant tingle which does not hurt and also makes my lips naturally red. I'm guessing it does this by stimulating the blood to come to the skin's surface.The gloss has a pleasant smell and is not sticky. I like the way it looks on my lips.I will buy it again for that reason, but not because it actually does what it says. Because it really doesn't plump."
5,Favorite lip plumper,"It doesn't itch, feels refreshing, is a beautiful, non-sticky lip gloss, and plumps me UP without burning! It's definitely a nice part of my morning. I love putting this on an watching my lips pucker up as I do the rest of my makeup. Every girl should have this in her purse. Great shipping and packaging, as well."
4,"Reproduction of plates is poor, you hardly can see them","This book is a reproduction of the original work in the 1800's. The original work's pictures perhaps were better.However, in this reproduction, the plates to which the author refers constantly, are very poor, reproduced in a very tiny size, you hardly can see the lines or features to whcih the author refers the reader to see. Since this is crucial to understand the menaining of the lines of the hand, I feel this is very unfortunate in this book. The only good drawing, were you clearly can see the author's writings is the one in the front cover. I had to look at it constantly in order to understand what the author was talking about, the inside pictures were of little help."
4,Cool!!,"The Bullseye figure is great!Poseable and detailed but one problem....NO WEAPONS!!!c`mon who is bullseye without his weapons.Well,he is worth buying but you gotta make your own weapons."
1,lack of information,I need a tool like this but will not order because: No specs on length of pole. No reviews from previous puchasors. No return privledges.
5,Best I have!!,This DVD player is great! The one my friend got is nowhere near to this DVD player. With the ability to read CD- R discs and MP3 encoded discs makes it a great DVD player. Viper
4,my first dvd player,"Being my first dvd player, I don't have a strong basis for comparison. But I can say the setup was extremely easy, the quality of the image appears excellent, the operation is largely intuitive, and the price seems right. Downsides: the manual is pretty skimpy. While there is a shuttle wheel on the face plate, the remote doesnt offer one. and the remote, which is called a universal remote, has no vcr controls, but does fine controlling my sony tv. I have yet to try the MP3/cd-r playback."
4,Firming After 50,A great way to get into shape at home. These exercises would also suit people of any age who have not done any exercise for a while. I highly recommend it.
2,"""Bad"" is Right","Like the first ""Big Book of Bart,"" this ""bad"" book is made up of many shorter comics; some as short as 4 pages. Also like the first book, these comics are a lot more childish than the other Simpsons Comics books. Many of the punch lines are more silly than funny. Highlights include Bart and Milhouse dressing up like Sonny and Cher to escape truant patrolman Leopold in ""Bart Simpson's Day Off,"" and the comic ""See You Later, Alligator"" which has the Comic Book Guy offering $25 shopping sprees for the best science fair projects (this comic actually has a good ending). This book also includes shorts featuring a day in the life of Ralph Wiggum and baby Kang and Kodos. To sum it up, the funniest moment of this book is the look on Smithers' face in ""See You Later, Alligator"" when Mr. Burns demands him to ""open that manhole for me."""
4,Because size does matter...,"I built and used these in WA state & they do put out nearly twice the heat of the single barrel style. As to the cheesy hardware, the extra functionality with the second barrel is worth another $3-4 bucks for some good hardware. I opted for stainless steel for rain forest application. (Also, doesn't hurt to clean up the casting flashing around the edges, either). In short, ""suck it up & git 'er done!"" The satisfaction of a warm place to work/hang out lasts way longer than the whining over a few screwy nuts & bolts...Update: Sadly, the double barrel kit now runs afoul of the nanny state in WA, so they are no longer available there. Upside: I don't live there anymore..."
5,Great overview of the history of New England,"When I have spare time (and I don't have a lot), I like to read history. So when a friend said she'd enjoyed Reflections in Bullough's Pond, I thought I'd give it a try. I'd say it was the best find of my summer reading season. Beginning before the settlement of New England by Europeans and continuing through the 20th century, the author traces the ways in which New England history has been shaped by the often-conflicting pressures exerted by economics and nature. I learned a tremendous amount about how New England got to be the way it is today, for example how Connecticut came to be a center of gun manufacturing and why we don't harvest many oysters off our coast anymore. I'd say any history buff should enjoy this book (it's really well-written, too), and I might just give it to a couple I know this Christmas. Thanks to the author!"
2,"has potential, but bored me","This is a strange book. I didn't find it mindblowing as others have, but I feel like this is because I'm more knowledgeable about the effects of mass media and other forms of influence (due to my profession). I can see that the book would be more exciting for some other people who don't think about these issues as often. The nice thing about it is there are a lot of references to interesting books and movies. However, I still think one would do better to read one of those books, than this book itself. For instance, pick up Robert Cialdini's Influence. Or a good book on memes."
3,"Good dvd player, poor CD player","This is good 5 disc DVD player. It has all of the output options you could wish for. I connected it to my a/v receiver using a $... Recoton optical cable. Video quality is good (this is my first dvd player, so I don't have anything to compare it to). Changing speed between disks is OK (not too long). The player also has a ""disk exchange"" feature. My only complaint is that it does not play my audio CDs very well (to be fair, most of my CDs are old and have minor scratches)."
3,Price?,"How much would it cost if you bought every song via iTunes?hint: (x * $0.99) {about the same price}The compression factor - for sound quality - you can have as a valid argument.What you're missing out on is the value as a ""Collector's Item"".Were there no eBay and no Amazon and you bought one, imagine what it would be worth in a few years.And you have to give them something for the creative effort.Think of it like the charity golf tournaments where they give a car away for a hole-in-one on the seventeenth hole (or whatever hole is the most difficult on that particular course). The news jumps all over it. (they take out an insurance policy, of course).hint: It's called free publicity.The reason the compression is the way it is is looking at how much would fit on a stick of a particular size and balance the price, manufacturing, packaging, etc.The first of anything is usually (not always) the most expensive."
4,"A Wonderful, Entertaining Read!",From the moment I picked up this book it grabbed me and held on! I enjoyed the complexity of the story and its characters. I hope there's more to come for Derek Chase!
4,Good,I just read the 'Everyman' play. For a morality play of medieval times is very entertaining and easy to read.
5,Love it!,"My interest in old Latin music was triggered from watching Disney's THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME , which was absolutely stuffed with these wonderful hymns, psalms, and masses (Get the soundtrack and the DVD! NOW!). So I went and got this disc, and was stunned.You needn't be a religious Catholic to enjoy these gorgeous Latin masses. I, an all-out Atheist, happen to get a tear in my eye every time I hear them."
3,Nasty Taste!,"This product is effective, but the taste is so horrible that I threw it all out. It is worth stating, I can endure nearly any taste if I feel I have a reason to, and with the expense of this product and two full trays... I had a reason to. Unfortunately, I found that I could not bring myself to chew this for the full five minutes recommended, since the taste got more and more bitter with every chew. Considering the many other options I have for caffeine (including Jolt Gum which is entirely palatable), I will not be buying this again."
5,"Practical, Well-Organized and Thorough.","I was worried that this book would be full of a mystical reliance on the working of the Spirit to have a renewed life. But boy, was I wrong about Lovelace! This systematic (yet sensical and practical) approach to living a renewed life as individuals and the corporate church is a great tool for church leaders."
4,Decent Buy,"This bag is nicely made. However, it only includes one hanger so unless you have a gown, it doesn't really work. My son had a suit for his baptism so I put his shirt and vest on the hanger, then I had to lay his pants at the bottom of the bag. Also, the pocket that they note isn't a separate pocket. The bottom of the bag is sealed up by an a couple of inches, which is what they consider a pocket. It'll due but it wasn't really what I had expected."
3,it's ok,"worked well guess.Puppies were full of worms so it has taken 3 doses and we still have worms,Was hoping it worked better"
2,Travesty,"This selection of Ruskin's writings fails to convey much about the passion and poetry of the man and his work. For an excellent Ruskin anthology, stick with Rosenberg's The Genius of John Ruskin."
1,The new Evil,"Disgusting, hateful, disrespectful propaganda. Congratulations on printing this garbage, and congratulations on those of you actually trying to find a book that supports these sick lies."
4,Love this lens,"If you're looking at this lens, you know what it is. It's a classic, standard angle, fast prime lens. The low light performance at f/1.4 is great. AF speed is slow though on my E-600. I believe the internal mechanism on the lens itself is slow. It does lock on in some pretty low light situations though (just not quickly). There is some vignetting at f/1.4 and f/2. This is largely gone by F/2.8 or f/4. The lens is pretty sharp at f/1.4 and I would say as sharp as it gets by f/2.8. Diffraction sets in by f/11. I wish it has a DOF on the lens, but I guess you have to buy old glass these days to get that feature. It is on my camera 75% of the time."
5,Excellent!,"This is an excellent book on Biblical Hermenuetics. It clearly shows how the Bible teaches us how to interpret itself. It makes understanding the Bible easier, and helps to show how God speaks to us today through His Word, and what He expects of us today."
5,great gift for single malt junkies,"Saw a copy of this book at a friends house and knew instantly I had to buy one for my husband. He loves single malt, and has been totally engrossed in the book since it arrived. Will now buy several more copies for friends. A great gift for single malt drinkers"
5,Michael Jackson Knows Single Malt,The story of Scotch whiskey as presented by Jackson is fascinating. The readings go best near a warm fire and a glass of Aberfeldy single malt.
3,"Good reference, but this edition not the work of Michael Jackson!","Be forewarned! This is a great reference, but Michael Jackson died well before it was completed. Much of the material written by him is quite old and possibly outdated. The editors have attempted to write new and updated reviews in his style and in accordance with his tastes. The book cover and the Amazon page were quite deceptive and these facts were not clear to me until after purchase. To make matters worse, the individual reviews give no indication as to who authored them. I for one would have appreciated knowing whether I was reading a review by MJ or by someone writing ""in his style."" Something as simple as italics, font, brackets, or the like would suffice.Overall, however, this a well written and fairly through reference and I would recommend it as one of the better works of this type."
5,Great Reading for Scotch Lovers,A well written and insightful guide to single malt Scotch that provides wonderful insight into the history of Scotch as well as succinct ratings and summary overviews of many of our favorites. Highly recommend!
4,"Good whiskey reference book, but could be better.","I chose this book after reading the reviews on it and checking out my friend's book by Jim Murray. It reads nicely and is an excellent primer on Scotch in general, offering information on origins, regions of production, distillation process, etc... I find I mostly agree with Jackson's ratings, though I've tried a couple of products he rates very highly which I definitely disagree on, and a couple of my favorites which he rates much lower than I expected. Where I find his ratings lacking is in commentary on how he arrives at the rating. He's descriptive of the characteristics (color, nose, body, palet and finish), but doesn't offer any insight as to why he asigns the given numeric value. Murray's book is far superior in that regard. The font is a nice size, where Murray's book is way too small for me to read without some magnification. Overall, I think this is a good book and worth the purchase price."
3,good in theory,"Love the concept, so did my 3 year old. BUT... the stickers don't stick very well! That doesn't fly with a 3 year old!"
4,Its excellent but I cant give it 5 stars!,"Richie Rich's Christmas Wish is a great movie. I really enjoyed it as it kept me entertained while I had the flu. I was laughing in alot of parts and it has a very interesting plot. It is true as one reviewer said, this movie in a way symbolizes Its a Wonderful Life but I enjoyed this one more because I cant stand sitting down to watch a Black and White film that was made in like the prehistoric years! I like this 7th Heaven dude better than the Home Alone dude because he fits the role of Richie Rich better. I recommend you to watch it. I watched it the other day on national television. It rocks!"
5,I have gained a new attitude upon reading the book.....,"I Thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Drive Your Woman Wild in Bed...""..And I must admit that I have gained a new perspective as well. I think my problem was that I was so used to convincing others I Knew it all(about Women)--That I might have convinced myself. Now I know more--And what I have gained from the book Is proving its worth in my applications.....nuff said....:)"
1,Poorly organized snippets of weak advice.,"This book covers a lot of ground, and none of it with any depth. It may say what to do, but rarely why. I didn't want hints on what to do, but insight into what turns women on and why. This book doesn't have it."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ....,"Don't think I'll be finishing this one! I always try to give an author respect for their efforts by finishing a book even if I find it boring, but I simply cannot stand the fantasies at the beginning of each chapter. It throws the reader of course, and is rather irrevelant. Frankly I'd rather not waste the time as I think I figured it out in the first 1/4 of the book. Maybe I'll finish it and see if I'm wrong..."
5,BEST REMOTE FOR UNDER [$]!!!,"You won't be disapointed, with killer features like this you can't go wrong."
1,Unbelievably noisy microwave. Disappointing,"Got this new from Amazon. Right away, unit made a lot of noise. Rattled and had a wierd power level cycle thing going on. Had a repairman come out, under warranty, waited two weeks, replaced almost everything. Fixed the power fluctuations, but still has VERY loud operating 'rattle' to it, said there's nothing they can do about it. I wish I sent it back."
1,Avoid this Microwave!,"I have had the white version of this microwave for almost a year and a half. Purchasing it was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made! It was noisy from the get-go and it sparks a lot if food is not placed in the exact center of the turntable. The light also flickers while the unit is running.Like the other reviewers, I called LG and had the service man come. He replaced some parts and the noise seemed better for awhile (he did not address the sparking, just said, ""wow, I haven't ever seen that before!"" Then the noise came back. When I called LG they gave me the ""too bad, warranty is expired"" line even when I voiced my concern that the sparking was a danger, especially to my children.I am now replacing the microwave on my own because we can't stand it anymore. I am writing this review because I want to save someone else the heartache I've been through. Don't choose this microwave. Go with a big brand name that you trust!"
3,"good cd, especially the ghetto song","it's really heard to find a good album that you can relate to. i must admit that i downloaded some of the tracks online, but as soon as i heard his music. i went to buy his cd. i listen to it everyday at work and the people i work with don't like hip hop, but for some reason they enjoy to listen to his music. i promise you that if you buy this cd you won't regret it, plus he has a unique voice. another good cd outthere is john legend. their music have meanings, it is not like them fools like 50 cents that preaching you about vilence and gangsta lives. thank you"
4,"Not his 1st project, is it?","Hi can someone tell me,This really isnt his 1st album, is it? am sure he did a few songs in 1995 or 1996 (Young little girl & Operation nature) Does anyone know about these songs?"
3,crunked up,have a better time and bump afroman. the beats and lyrics are true. join the streetteam on the website
2,Not one of Winston's best efforts,"The American Civil War should have been named Robert E. Lee's Civil War. 85% of the books attention is paid to Lee's character, Lee's battles, Lee's brilliance, Lee's nobility, Lee's wisdom. At the end of the War Churchill rightly criticizes Lee for his faulty generalship in sending thousands to die in frontal assaults when the war was clearly lost, but his fixation on Lee still borders on worship. There were other things going on in the War, like the War in the West, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Atlanta campaign, March to the Sea, etc., but Churchill concludes these events did not require any full discussion. Either Winston had a deadline to meet and was out of time or he displays a surprising lack of knowledge by leaving out at least half of the Civil War. But of course if you are a Lee fan, then you'll love this one."
2,Interesting but not especially fun,"If you're interested in dancing merengue, or hearing what gets played in the Dominican Republic this cd isn't for you. It's older recordings and though you can hear the roots of modern Merengue and Bachatta the Putomayo cd (believe it's called ""Republica Dominica"" is MUCH better!). I would have rated this a ""1"" as I never listen to it but I have to admit it was interesting enough to give a few spins when I first got it. Recommended for the true hardcore Merengue completist and musicologists only."
4,Very good,"With a movie like this, and the others for the After Dark Horrorfest, you expect a certain cheesiness but this one kept it to a minimum. The story turned out very believable and entertaining. In world of cheese ball horror flicks, this movie captures the true essence of what a horror movie should be."
2,Stopped working,This is my second Aroma oven. It appears that these are no longer manufactured. My first one lasted 4 years of daily use. The second one started making fan noises last week (today is 12/26/2012) and today the fan stopped working .... the second unit is only 1 year old. I loved this unit when it was working .... I use it at least twice a day. I liked the fact that it does not use halogen bulbs which seem to explode in some units. At this point I don't know what I am going to do since even the Breville convection oven has it's problems. Don't they make anything to last these days?
5,nathan,"I would just like to say that this is an excellent product. I tried this product over a year ago and does exactly what it says. I take 1-2 tablets about 20 minutes before I go to bed and I sleep soundly the whole night. I recently started working 3rd shift and it was hard for me to sleep during the day the first few weeks. However, when I began taking this I immediatly began falling to sleep faster and sleeping so much sounder than ever before. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to sleep much better and still feel alert when they wake up."
1,Schiff Melatonin Plus 3 mg Melatonin with 25 mg Theanine,"As a sleep aid this formulation was no better than Melatonin alone. Further, I am not convinced that Melatonin is efficacious as a sleep aid. The only effective OTC sleep aid I have found is Doxylamine Succinate. Unfortunately, a 25 mg tablet will leave you groggy in the morning. I suggest trying half a tablet first."
4,It's nice but for me I had to split it,"I was buying 1mg on here because I read most people only need the low dosage, and boy did it make a difference. When I came back to buy more, the price had skyrocketed, and these were the best deal I could find. I don't like the tablets (not capsules) but for dissolving i suppose they are better. I planned on splitting them and taking half, but it's hard to split them easily because they aren't hard tablets, they kind of turn into powder. First night I took half, I didn't have any big noticeable difference from my previous ones (slept fine, fairly alert, worked fine). Last night I was in a rush and decided to take an entire one, and that was a big mistake. This morning I was sooo groggy and slept in, it was really hard to get up. My sleep seemed to be fine, because once I got up and was awake I was fine, but my morning took forever to come out of it and for it to work out of my system."
3,helps me fall asleep sometimes,"i order a bottle of this item once a year to help me fall asleep. i believe it's all natural and easy to swallow. i'm knocked out within 30 minutes and sometimes it doesn't work at all. it's a ""hit or miss."""
4,Light summer read,"Cute story good for a light read, loved Kinsellas shopper series. This isn't quite that good but, good for a diversion. Shipping from this supplier was fast and book arrrived in perfect condition earlier than I had expected."
2,Stick with Kinsella instead of Wickham,"Why do I keep trying to read Madeline Wickham books? It's those darn book jackets that pull me in. I'm expecting a fun, frothy beach read (like her Kinsella books), and they are nothing of the kind. When she writes as Kinsella, she is funny, witty, romantic, and enjoyable. As Madeline Wickham, she creates unappealing characters and boring plotlines. In this instance, she makes Simon so unappealing that the reader never warms up to him. Why would I want him to get the girl? I don't. Molly, the heroine, is sweet, but frustrating. She is never honest with her loved ones. The ""secret"" theme has been done ad nauseum, and this sheds absolutely no new light on it. I think if the book jackets were more appropriate to the slower, more serious story lines, I would have the proper expectations when I buy one. However, this is nothing like the fun chick lit it appears to be and that I enjoy reading occasionally. It's bland and completely forgettable."
2,My least favorite...even of the Wickham books!,"As has been noted by other reviewers, there is a disconnect between Sophie Kinsella books and Madeline Wickham books. I agree, but being an avid reader, and someone author loyal, I've decided to give Madeline Wickham a try (I've read about 4 of her other books). While MW stories are not nearly as lighthearted as SK stories (the characters often have fewer redeeming characteristics, a bit mean spirited, the storylines are heavier), this was by far my least favorite. Perhaps it was because I just finished reading the lighthearted and surprisingly touching The Twenties Girl.At any rate, I found this book difficult to finish, especially considering it is chick lit. The plot seemed too over the edge, the characters were immeadiately unlikeable, and I felt that while it tried to end happily ever after it didn't seem to resolve anything.I'll think twice before reading another Madeline Wickham."
3,While I Was Gone,"This book arrived in good condition, almost new looking. I was satisfied with this product."
2,When Do I Get to the Good Part?,"Sorry, but I am dissapointed in this book, this is the first book I have read that Oprah has recommended. I am almost to the middle of the book and I am still waiting for something to happen to pick up the pace. From the beginning of the book I find it boring. I guess I was expecting too much since it was on Oprah's Book Club list. Sue Miller decribes the chararacters and surroundings in too much detail for me. Let's get on to the plot of the story! Definitely not a must read, can't put down book to me! Hopefully, as I struggle thru it the plot will pick up."
2,while i was gone,"Well written, but uninteresting.Sue Miller can write, she's good at developing characters, and also at writing dialogue. But I found this particular story is quite ordinary, even though it deals w/a particular horrific event. It's surprising that there couldn't have been more of a payoff after going through this journey.By the middle I was so bored, but was determined to finish this book, hoping that it would have some kind of exciting finish. Very disappointing.I doubt I'll pick up her future books."
2,Not very impressed,I never felt very compassionate for the characters. They didn't stir anything in me except maybe the daughter that was the musician. She was the only interesting person.
1,Slow and boring!,"I will usually finish each book I start, but there was no way I could finish this book, no matter how hard I tried. I barely made have to chapter 8 and was still waiting for something...anything of interest to happen. Would not recommend to anyone!..."
2,OK at the beginning,"At first I was really into this book, but near the middle I lost interest. I like the writer's style, but didn't really care for the story. I couldn't really relate to Eli Mayhew, and didn't really care about the relationship between him and the main character. The daughters were not really likable either."
3,Not What I was Hoping For,This book had so much potential to be great but in the end it just didn't deliver. I found it hard to like the main character because she seemed very selfish. The main plot could have been interesting but the details were too boring and drawn out. I would not recommend it.
1,"This book just didn't cut it for me, or any of those people.","Licking through a field of corn, you just don't know whose watching you, and these days I wouldn't want to trust this book to my family or anyone else's family, or Bill, or my work people."
1,Awful,I enjoy almost every book Oprah recommends but this was awful awful awful. I would suggest saving your money for next month's pick.
4,Many true-to-life scenarios,"I was very entertained by this book--by the genuine feelings and actions of the main character--Joey Becker. Jo's rationalization of her actions and her criticism of those rationalizations was something many female readers can relate to. However, I did find Daniel's character a little too saintly and the daughters a bit too nasty. I was enthralled however with the youngest daughter's explanation for the nastiness in the twins. This book was filled with many experiences that are true to life!"
5,An excellent book describing emotions have alot of women,"Sue Miller wrote an excellent book---putting into words the emotions alot of women have. I have a rather dull life (I would not have it any other way), but you do sometimes wonder where other paths will lead. In some ways I am envious of Jo---she has experienced both sides---the tawdry and the innocent---and has come to realize that the innocent is not all that bad. But at least she had the experience, and will take it with her forever. So remember 'thou who cast the first stone shalt be without sin', and read ""When I was Gone"". It is wonderful."
2,Are we supposed to feel sympathetic to Jo?,"The main character marries, then has a desire to lead a seedy life, leaves her husband, lives in a commune and then gets a second chance and blows it all for what? I did not feel drawn to see her side of things because she was very selfish. She was just darn lucky Daniel decided to forgive her....."
