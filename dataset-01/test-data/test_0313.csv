2,"From Breathtaking to Boring, This Superman Dosen't Fly","Everything that Superman stands for is shamelessly trashed in this third installment. All the wonder and excitement of the first 2 films are ill-chosenly traded for comic relief. Director Richard Lesters opening slapstick ballet is silly and doesn't belong in this movie. Unfortunately, the diabloic villanary of Gene Hackman is replaced with the droll antics of Richard Pryor. Christopher Reeve gives it his all but not even a man of steel can save this mindless sequal from the bowels of obscurity."
1,Superman as a comedy?,"The moment you insert a comedian into a starring role for a film like this, you know what you get? Crap, that's what. My god, even the movie poster for this film is bad. There are a few nice moments in the film, primarily with the scenes of Clark Kent talking with old sweethart Lana Lang, but they last but a few minutes and then the film continues back down the bowels. This film only serves to infuriate you more and make you wonder why no one seems to be able to make a good Superman film. Dreadful."
1,"I wanted to give it no stars, but it wouln't let me","This is THE worst Superman film ever, it might even be the worst movie ever made!!!! If you want a good superman film DVD collection like I have, here's a list:Superman: The Movie 4-Disk setSuperman II: The Richard Donner CutSuperman Returns 2-Disk setUnfortunatly you get less movies this way, but they're makind a sequal so hopefully it'll be good, however you'll have to wait unyl 2009, so my advice, watch Superman cartoons, read Superman comics, and all that other stuff, then 2009 will be here before you know it! Just don't watch this (and don't watch IV either.)"
1,Superman 3 review,"This movie stinks. The opening looks nothing nothing like the ones from the films. They look like they added in at the last minute. Its like those Star Wars text things you get in most movie-editing softwares. It was also a bad reminder of those 3 stooges shorts starring Joe Besser. Infact this WHOLE film is a bad reminder of the Joe Besser days of the 3 Stooges. Richard Pryor is very unfunny in this stinkfest. I think he had more screen time then Superman did. There are some good points in the film like Superman saving the powerplant and the kid. The Evil Superman is pretty bad[bleep] and much more then Emo Peter from Spiderman 3. Sadly these good points fail to save the film in the long run. The effects and fights are standard. Overall,It still awful. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
4,I liked it!,"I've seen this movie a hundred times and I still love it. Richard Pryor is not one of my favorite comedians but I thought he did good in this 3rd installment of SUPERMAN. I thought the special effects were good and the story was very interesting. I found Annette O'toole to be the perfect Lana (comparing to the young Lana from the first movie) and thought this added alot to the movie, including the action between the 2 Supermans. I can't understand why this movie received bad rap from others. SUPERMAN I, II, and III are my favorite. I could have done without the fourth movie."
4,Sheer Family Entertainment What more could you want?,"Superman 3 is a mixture of comedy,action and suspense.Remember Superman 1 and 2 were more serious movies than Superman 3, so therefore it is fun to see Superman 3 take on a different approach.Richord Pryor and Chris Reeve excell in this film. There is nothing wrong with comedy in a Superman movie as long as the action is there. This movie did just that. WELL DONE SUPERMAN !"
3,"NOT AS BAD AS IT'S KNOWN TO BE BUT, NOT QUITE GOOD EITHER 2 3/4 STARS!","Superman III starts out like an old slap stick comedy act. After throwing caution to the wind in Superman II, I guess they figured they could get away with anything!?? The film has a reputation for being really awful, but it's mildly entertaining and actually has moments of brilliants. I loved the evil Superman segments and I was happy to see a different villian. All but Reeves from the original cast phone in their performances and the FX budget looks like it was cut. This could have been a really good installment, but it seems like a quick cash in to me. Compared to part IV..........!"
3,Disappointing Sequel,"Superman III is the turning point in the Superman series as it concentrates solely on Richard Pryor's way of acting. I dislike the direction Richard Lester has taken to Superman III, the plot is somewhat lacking. Christopher Reeve is again the shining light of the film and I still think there are several decent scenes in this film:- for example, the battle between Clark Kent and the evil Superman and the powerplant explosion etc. However, some of the film is quite dull and boring, mainly due to the fact that it has a largely un-interesting storyline.Anyway it brings back memories for me when I was younger, therefore I feel it deserves to be in my DVD collection. Superman III = 3 stars (just!)"
5,CAIFANES el mejor grupo de rock en espanol.,Saul Hernandez es el mejor compositor y cantante que existe en la historia del rock. Aunque a tenido problemas con su voz sigue cantando chido. El disco esta chido tiene las canciones mas buenas que tuvieron y sus exitos. Se los recomiendo.~! VIVA SAUL HERNANDEZ Y EL ROCK EN ESPANOL!~
1,Far below what I was expecting,This book was useless. If you need a control book for self-study get Nise'e book. Crystal Clear explanations. He takes you a step by a step to the solutions. After this if you still need more.. Go to Ogata and look at more problems. Dont think about this one.
1,Horrible text,"This book is the worst image processing text I have ever read. The material is presented in an illogical flow. The author tries too hard to present a top-level qualitative explanation and then quits and jumps right into the equations with little derivation and insight. The typesetting and notation is very distracting. The only good thing was the explanation of the relationship between 2-D Fourier Transforms, Abel Transforms, and the Hankel transforms. Get yourself a real Fourier analysis textbook like Gaskill's ""Linear Systems, Fourier Transforms, and Optics"" and a good image processing text like Gonzalez and Wood's ""Digital Image Processing"" and you'll be much better off."
4,"Very good horse, action movie!","If your a fan of the Mummy, Scorpion King, or Indiana Jones. (Or anything else with the same time era) you will LOVE this movie.This movie had some very nice effects, storyline and even some twists that could make you shed a tear.This movie did not get boring at all since it started in my eyes. Was a movie also worth watching again and again.All I can say is that the movie was worth it, filled with action and suspense, if your able to watch it, go for it and you wont regret it."
4,Better than expected,The desert makes a grand backdrop for a horse race while Viggo Mortensen serves up enough charisma to carry the movie. The script is hardly ground breaking following the standard redemption theme mold. But there's enough creative challenges to keep one's interest. Fit for family viewing.
4,HIDALGO,"As a young White boy growing up on the Navajo reservation was very wonderful, this movie brought back many wonderful memories. The Navajo friends I had, all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends were spent riding through the bueatiful high deserts of Northern Arizona. This movie is a great movie, it has all the emotions a person may feel in the 1880's. Some what, as I felt when we moved to Northern Arizona in 1960. The people were wonderful to grow up with. This movie is a great movie, the only problem I had with the DVD is that to see the Bonus Features you have to have a special computer. I would have been happy to spend the extra money on the movie, if they could have just put it on the DVD. I would very much like to see the extra parts that have been left out, unless you have a computer that will read these extra parts. Other wise I would have given this movie a 5 star ratings"
1,you can't polish a turd and expect a gem,"Boy, Viggio sure wasted all that cache he accumulated while playing Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings. What a waste of talent. The story is pathetic and Viggio looks like a dork wearing that ridiculous hat-reminds me of Dukakis wearing that helmet in the tank. Cinematography is nice, but it can't make up for the rest of this dud. Don't even bother renting it."
1,Absolute Trash,"If there was a dog symbol or the option of choosing no stars, I would have done that instead. This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is garbage (Hollywood cheese at its finest), the action scenes have been done countless times before, and the special effects $'s could have been better used on a more proficient line producer and a better equipped cast of actors. Vigo is no Aragorn here and that's not the point. The point is that his acting in this movie just plain sucks. Don't give Hollywood your hard earned dollars for this piece of crap, buy a used copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark instead."
2,biographic,Viggo does a marvelous acting job as a cowboy who loves his horse. Especially liked that his character was real. Have watched this movie three times now.
1,dreadful,"Sorry, but I can't think of one good thing to say about this movie. It was dreadful from start to finish. Mortenson was wooden and the plot was a yawn. Couldn't wait to get out of the movie theater."
4,Great transaction..Just a bit slow on delivery,This item was a gift to my neice. She said the package arrived in great condition but was a bit dissapointed in what she thought would be a quick delivery. Otherwise everything was great.I will use this seller again.
1,The movie that wouldn't play.,"Hi, I bought the movie Hidalgo for a birthday present and when they went to play it they got an error and weren't able to watch it. I have sent a message to the seller informing them of what has happened and waiting for a reply."
5,Intriguing gem of a movie...,"Not since ""Dances with Wolves"" has a movie come out that portrays the emotional complexities of one who is caught between the love of his people and his alliegance to his country so eloquently. Viggo Mortensen tears up the screen as a man haunted by a past he longs for but has distanced himself from for the sake of survival. Set against the backdrop of the Sahara Desert, the story revolves around an annual horse race that the main character accepts an invitation to participate in with his Mustang steed. Ambition, greed, lust, and power are all explored in this epic adventure. But the main theme is about a man finding his way back to himself."
2,THIS IS NOT A BOOK ABOUT ST. JOHN...,"It is a book about moving to paradise, and it is very interesting if you ever dreamed of doing the same thing. This couple made the dream come true! But it wasn't easy -- they don't actually reach St. John until the second half of the book [which I should also warn you contains a distracting amount of typos]. The first half describes all the planning and logistics of their move.This is a great book to read in the dead of winter, when you're longing to escape to your own paradise. But if you're really seeking information specific to St. John, I urge you to look at books written by Gerald Singer or Pamela Acheson."
3,I love Ellen's DVDs,"This is one of my favorite seasons, I have all Ellen DVDs. However, one odd thing about this dvd is that the first volume of the dvd plays pretty much in every dvd player, even in Europe... they're not region code 1, just like all the other Ellen Seasons. But the weirdest thing is that volume 2 and 3 of Season 5 are all of the sudden region code 1 and they don't play on a European DVD Player. Sure I can watch the episodes on a computer but that is kinda annoying and it absolutely doesn't make any sense that in one dvd pack 1 works for Europe and the 2 other ones don't.Also I would have appreciated if there had been subtitles for people hard of hearing.So I have to say, I love the Ellen sit-com but the ones that put it on DVD, they kinda screwed up."
4,Murray as Pollyanna,"A highly-readable book, largely free of jargon or negativity, but almost totally free of anything perspective other than the free market as cure-all. I bought a copy as a handbook of useful references, web sites, etc.I find it odd that Mr. Murray omitted any mention of the Tennessee Valley Authority, a key part of FDR's response to the Great Depression, providing low-cost electric power, flood control, navigation, etc. Growing up in Chattanooga, Murray sell knows that flood protection for the City of Chattanooga was and is a prime mission of the agency. TVA has long been a world-renowned model of of efficient and beneficial government involvement."
5,AWSOME BAND WITH AWSOME TUNES!,"This band ROCKS! If you haven't seen them live you have to go out and do it! But first buy the CD! The music is awsome, the kind you never get tired of listening to! If you want your heart to beat wildly and your blood to pump....get SPARKS FLY!"
4,Definately a best buy...,"Why buy seperately when you can get both games basically for the price of one... We havent played Scattergories yet, but Guesstures is awesome.. its a ton of fun!"
4,if you're unsure about the games,"i didn't know what guesstures was until i bought the game and it's more fun than scattegories. it's a real quick-paced game (just like charades, but 4 acts in a row). scattegories (if you don't already know) is where you roll a letter and everyone who's playing have to go down a list, naming all the things they can figure out that starts with that specific letter. that's a little unclear, but this is the game jessica simpson played in the newlyweds show."
4,One of the best,"I have two of these. One is a model that is no longer availible and the other is the current model. I boughtthe first to replace a sony rack system that i had for about ten years. I would still be useing it if lighting had not burned it beyond repair. I tried many through a rental company and found that thy didn't met the quality that i had become acustomed to. when I found this system, it once again made me ask the question, is that dog barking outside or on the tv? The only thing that i had a complant about was that I had a DVD and Sat PVR and both had digital audio outs. The older version only had the one in with the choice of either optical or coaxial. This one has them seperated between video 2 and video 3. I love it now. I still use them both."
2,This dvd is not in DTS OR 5.1 what the!,"This ""OK"" movie is limited from the start in it's lack of good sound, and directing quality. The movie, though on dvd, is not in any other sound format then MONO, YeS MONO. Woody Allen failes to take this movie seriously from the start.And goes on and on & on & on. Like most Woody movies it could benifit from a new up to date Director! Ricci tries hard to bring the movie up from crap and does somewhat."
2,Basically an awful Annie Hall remake,Woody Allen has slowly declined in excellence. This has to be the worst of his movies. Jason Biggs can't act his way out of a paper bag. I think if they would've picked a different actor for the lead like maybe Owen Wilson maybe this could've worked. Ricci is also pretty terrible in this movie. Allen has some choice lines but he is a sidekick which sort of hurts this movie. I suggest you watch any other woody allen film but this one.
3,Slow moving,"Anything Else is a slow moving film. It is the only Woody Allen comedy that I've found boring. The few humorous scenes and witty dialogue reminded me of some other Allen film of bygone years. Danny De Vito might have been able to add a bit of spice to the humor. He wasn't funny. The stars were simply not interesting, a major flaw. Someone has suggested that the film would have succeeded if the leads had been played by Woody himself with Mia Farrow. Only a remake would answer that question. Did Juliet Taylor let us down? Or has Woody Allen lost his flair for writing an interesting plot."
3,Not the Wood Man's best...,"There is good news and bad news about Woody Allen's Anything Else. The bad news is that it definitely isn't the Wood Man's best - even though a bad Woody Allen film is better than most other people's ""good"" films. It feels oddly long for some reason, even though it's about an hour and fifty minutes long. On the bright side, Woody has returned to writing about young people. I am a big Jason Biggs fan so I am glad to see him cast in the role of the young Woody Allen. (Remember when John Cusack played the young Woody Allen and then HE got too old?) He and Christina Ricci are very good in their roles. So is Woody Allen, for that matter, in the role of the old Woody Allen. Even though the movie, as a whole, is uneven, there are still a few good Woody laughs along the way. As always, New York never looks better and there is a great Billie Holiday soundtrack."
1,Anything Else,The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack. There was no plot and every character was neurotic.
5,If you enjoy smart funny films do not miss this one.,"Even if you don't love Woody Allen's films...but...If you don't love Woody Allen's films, at least his romantic period stuff (Annie Hall to A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy),you don't like movies.Go to the couch. Pull out that Pearl Harbour special edition...or Armageddon...sit back...and just let it roll."
1,TRULY BAD,There's absolutely no way anybody with any love for the movies or Woody Allen could love this really really poor movie. I thought Hollywood Ending was bad but this is worse!!!If you are a Woody Allen fan do yourself a favor and stay away from this one! The man has many a good movies in his filmographythis is certainly not one of them !!!!!!!!!
5,Great Red!,"I love OPI it is a top quality polish used in many salons everyday, including mine. No need for top and base coats. However, when I do use a topcoat, mani's and pedi's last several days longer. ""Thrill of Brazil"" is a great red. I can see why it was reviewed as a ""staple"" red. Thrill of Brazil is not as light/bright as ""So Hot it Burns"" or ""Big Apple Red"" or even ""Oui Bit of Red""(these are what I consider the lighter more traditional reds) but not as dark as ""I'm Not Really a Waitress"" (which is a fabulous red for fall/winter). ""Thrill of Brazil"" is ""NOT"" as hot pink of a red like in the picture. I thought it would be more pink than red. However, this will be one of my summer reds because it is a fabulous dramatic red but not too dark for the season. I ordered from Xpressyourself. It came in 5 business days with a lower shipping than others it seemed. Very pleased with them."
5,Linney Amazing,"While the bleeps are irritating, Laura Linney is more than worth the look. She is just wonderful as the cancer victim who rushes out to face life while she has it."
1,Terrible,"I've seen better ""fight scene editing"" in the old 1950's cowboy flicks. I had high expectations. This movie is just plain horrible. Don't waste your time with this movie. It will be on TBS in endless ""Saturday Morning"" reruns soon enough."
4,Southern gentleman/ fighter,"The protagonist in the drama , Fighting, brings to the story one who covers his rage with southern manners. On the one hand, he treats everyone (even the street vender who sells the stuffed toy bunnies) with respect. But, given the chance he gains respect defending himself against others who represent NYC's different cultures, including the money lenders, & Wall Street brokers. The fights are fantastic. The friendship between Channing Tatum ( Shawn) & Terrence Howard (Harvey) grows throughout the film & brings the story to a surprising end."
5,"action, action, action,","this movie is very good, with none stop action. buy this movie its real good. 5-star movie......"
5,Bread & Journey,"""Bread & Circuses""...An episode written by Gene Roddenberry & Gene Coon...an episode with the hidden Easter message. It works quite well.""Jounrey to Babel"" Meet Spock's father Sarek for the first time.Jane Wyatt stars as Amanda...Spock's mother. Kirk is almost killed in an assassination attempt and Sarek almost dies.We also get a ""first look"" at the Andorians. I feel kinda sorry for the Tellarite though. He suffered from bad makeup."
2,ill fitting sweatshirt,This was a gift and honestly it did not fit my sister well at all. It must have been a second because the length of the sleeves. I ordered a large and that should have been plenty large enough but the sleeves were too short and it was too tight at the waist. I cannot recommend this product.
4,Missing screw,"Package was missing a screw, had to find one at a local store. not a huge problem. Just annoying. Otherwise fine product."
2,What is a Film But its Moments?,"The thing about this one is that you never feel the story is worth the time spent filming it; it's a series of movements Mr. Bronson (the quietest, most somber man in action film history; makes Ah-Nuld look chatty) goes through, and he's gone through them so many times before that you would swear you'd seen this before. In a sense you did, with the exception of...moments.The one most memorable here: the good 'doctor'(Mengele wannabe) Chaz has been hunting gets his just desserts not via a bullet but through the crippled amputees he has experimented on over the years. Sort of reminded me of a zombie flick at that point.Not terribly entertaining. A rental at best, and only if all the Van Damme films are out."
2,Brutal,This movie was one of the most brutal Bronson movies ever. The torture scene alone was disturbing as hell. Bronson is a professional who is hired to stop a torturer for hire. It is again a brutal movie and it is only Bronson that can stop it. A good Bronson movie but not for everybody.
5,Felicity senior year.,I purchased my CD several weeks ago and I truly enjoy the whole CD. I liked to series and the back drop music so I decided to buy it. I am glad I did. The songs kind of put one in a peaceful state of mind.
3,Just OK,"The CD is fine, but not outstanding. I bought the CD because I loved the theme song, ""New Version of You,"" and wanted to hear all of it. What I didn't realize, but should have, is that the theme music is the entire song, not an excerpt from a longer, complete version. I was a little disappointed that (1) there wasn't a longer version and (2) I had spent money for a CD to find that out."
4,Felicity's dirty little secret,"A number of American TV shows, like Dark Angel and for many years The X-Files, are actually filmed in Canada.This soundtrack takes an odd twist, in that, while the show is entirely American, the soundtrack contains at least four Canadian acts!The Barenaked Ladies should need no introduction. Chantel Krevisaiuk is also the singer of the theme music from ""Providence"" (""In My Life"") and is married to the lead singer of one of Canada's best bands, Our Lady Peace. 54-40 have been a staple of Canadian radio for over a decade, and Maren Ord is another Canadian.Ironically, this season of Felicity was not seen on Canadian airwaves until early May 2002, several months after it appeared on The WB (or UPN, us Canucks can't tell 'em apart)."
1,I can't believe I watched the whole thing!!!!,"....all 8 minutes of it. This is the most ridiculous dvd I have ever ordered. If I had noticed it is only 8 minutes long, I would not have bothered to order it, even if it was for one dollar.(I paid $9.99) Now that I have opened the package, I can not return it. This is the worst ripoff ever."
4,Belt Buckle,"Love the Belt Buckle, its for my Son in Law for Christmas and it looks exactly as pictured, but...... my son in law is a very big man and I am afraid this buckle runs on the small size, more of a womens sized belt buckle, and this one is gonna be lost on him. Wish I would have looked more for a size etc., Live and Learn"
1,"Pass the Class, Not the National Registry","I've been working as an EMT for 5+ years now. I was able to answer the questions in the practice sets only because I knew the answers from work experience. But I was really frustrated with the wording of the questions. I would imagine that you could get pretty confused about the order of performing your ABCs after reading this book. The questions in this book aren't nearly as hard as the registry's bank of questions, but I would say the way they phrase the questions makes it twice as confusing. This book might be a nice reference to a student who is going through the EMT program, but not as a guide for the National Registry."
3,Same old dialogue,Good movie and it's more believeable having a younger actress play a 6yr old Helen but the dialogue is almost the same as the other 2 versions albeit a little more modern on occasion. I was hoping for a fresh approach.I enjoyed it just for the fact that a young/small child payed Helen instead of a 13 or 14yr old.
1,Stale Acting! Not the spirited Annie and Helen that we love,"I was very excited that there was another ""Miracle Worker"" coming out, but unfortunately I was very, very, disapointed! I have seen both of the first ones many times and I love them both! Patty Duke is amazing! I would not recomend this movie at all, yes, Helen is very cute in it but the acting is rigid and stale. I want the old spirit back!"
5,To ALL parents who are finding it difficult to discipline their child.,"Because the child comes from their womb, many mothers find it hard to discipline their child. Here is the greatest movie about raising a child. It is universal in that it is a manual of how to raise all children. I should know, I am a teacher. We usually have about 198 students to discipline daily (6 classes of 33 children each). I also teach at a school for the visually impaired. In the interest of all children, please watch this movie. It is such a great movie."
3,It's OKAY!!!!,"WHY ON EARTH DID THEY DO THIS?! IF I WAS ANNE BANCROFT OR PATTY DUKE, I WOULD WANT TO KILL THEM FOR DOING THIS TO A CLASSIC MOVIE I WON AN ACADEMY AWARD FOR!!!I dare say that it did seem a little more emotional on Alison Elliott's part (maybe because she actually did cry in this movie), but Hallie Kate Eisenburg is almost listless in this movie! I wonder who all was turned down for this role!I did like the food fight, but the rest didn't seem all that great. I think if you want your kids/family to watch something about Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan, I wouldn't even BOTHER with this remake! I mean, why do a remake on a movie that already has been remade?You should read my review on the original version to get the story-line. And to think that THIS was my favorite movie before I watched Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke. What was I thinking -- or was I?Oh well, you get the point: if you want to buy it, change your mind and buy the original!!!!!!"
2,Don't believe the 7 days,"As in other books in this series, the ""7 days"" is the way the book is organized into the days of an imaginary one week trip. You can't possibly learn the book's contents in 7 days. And even if you could it wouldn't help much - too narrow, too little vocabulary, not enough grammar. Cute photos, though. If you're going to Japan for a visit, get a good phrase book; if you really want to learn Japanese, get a course in it. Also check out kwikpoint.com for nifty folders of pictures that you can point to for your travel communications in ANY language."
2,Not The Greatest,"You can do some pretty amazing things with this software. However, as with most Microsoft developement products, WIERD things happen for no reason and this product becomes unstable at times. Additionally, the price for this product is outrageous. On a lighter note, this product works well when used with Visual Basic."
3,Very Disappointed!!!,I've had this product for quite some time after it came out which I payed $... to get it. I was very disapointed when it came to the grahical side of this product. In the SRMA program to import a mesh you need another software product that is not included. I mean really who wants buy this under the impression that once buy GPSK 4.0 they are ready to make their own 3d games when really they have to spend another $... getting a program that can make and export meshes before they can even start to make character models.?
5,Great Software Here!,This software is great if you want to learn how to make a 3d game like the first Quake or Doom/Doom2. If you are an advanced programmer get a better engine like codewarrior!
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This product is not what the illustration and labeling on the box suggests. Game programming is a difficult multidisciplinary expertise that integrates storytelling, artwork, modeling, programming and strategy. Each skill must be explained separately and in detail. Then these skills must be learned and integrated to give you your expertise.This product does not do this. It is little more than a crippled Visual C++ 6.0 compiler, a couple of third party game development tools and a book full of game developers' anecdotes. It's a joke.Worse, the C++ documentation is in PDF(hard on the eyes) and VC++ is already difficult for a newbie. The two third party tools are poorly documented, at best.Wanna learn the basics of game programming? I suggest Java Game Programming for Dummies. Ready to learn Windows game progamming technology? Consider *Windows Game Programming for Dummies*. But don't throw your hard earned dineros in this landfill."
1,"Why, Why, Why???","I brought this product, because i needed an animator for a game i was working on. Great???. However, the version you get, is an absolutely useless shareware version, and after checking out the rest of the stuff included, i was even more dissapointed. The version of C++ is a ""working model"" edition, so you cannot redistribute your files, and the Gensesis 3d engine is open source, and available for free, and you can get the latest version aswell. So, i suppose it's the price of a book??? It does include 3 books, right? Wrong, 2 of them are PDF files, and the other one will not introduce you to game programming at all. The name sells it wrong, don't you think??? KEEP AWAY from this product, i think anyone who wanted to buy a Game Programming Starter Kit would want to know how to program!!!"
1,Not in English,They realy need to list the spoken language of the show in the discription. Yes there is subtitles. But don't wast your money.
1,Review of digital product not the show itself,Throughout the stream the image was not good. The text is very jagged and noticeably pixelated plus the artifacting is just as bad. Between the blurry image and trying to read jagged subs I gave up trying to watch it. Also please mark shows dubbed or subbed ... would be nice for those who have a preference either way.
1,Nasty product!!,"Make sure no kids watch it! I pick it as browse the anime, it turned out to be a Nasty product!"
2,Disappointing computer graphics,"I was really looking forward to getting this series, but it was a let down. The information on the ancient battles is great and the narrator Matthew Settle (Band of Brothers) is fine but the computer graphics to detail the battles is dull and repetitive. The CGI effects make all the soldiers look the same and their movments look like swarms of bee's rather than anything specific to the battle. If you don't like the graphics (which I didn't), then you're pretty much 'done' with the series because they are the major tool used to bring the stories alive."
3,Decisive Battles Series at Times Too Robotic for Its Own Good,"The History Channel combines actor Matthew Settle, well-known historians, decent location footage ... and clunky computer-generated imagery to reenact and explain the decisive impact of thirteen battles on the history of the Ancient World. Most computer-generated soldiers and officers look alike and operate like ""robots"" on the recreated battlefields. To its credit, ""Decisive Battles of the Ancient World"" shows with success that learning about both history and geography does not need to be ""boring."""
2,Only for Newbies to The Cure,"The only things of interest to a well-versed Cure fan would be an interview with Steve Serverin (Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Glove), and the listing of bootleg shows at the end.Overall, I really don't recommend this to anybody but a complete neophyte."
4,purple,i hope that my darker hair will show this purple color. i really want to have purple hair but i don't want too much of it as well. i'm just going to try it.
2,What a disappointment,"I have read a couple of Sylvia's books before and found them thought provoking even if I didn't agree with everything in them. I am very open to the mysteries of the world and all of the possible origens. However, I was disappointed with this book. There was very little original/psychic information. Instead, there were a lot of common known background facts, references to websites such as www.mysteriesoftheworld.com, and self-promoting statements like ""my psychic abilities confirm this information"".Looking at amazon's ratings, I am doubtful of all the higher ratings given to this book. Amazon's ratings tend to be pretty much on target. Maybe Sylvia's huge church/corporation/followers are promoting this book. Also, it looked like ALL of Sylvia's books were highly rated on Amazon. Certainly, every author would have fluctuations on which books were better than others. I would recommend- check out the above mentioned web site. You won't miss a thing."
3,interesting book,This is an easy book to read cause you can just skip chapters and read about only what you are interested in.. I am not sure I agree with some stuff she says but it is interesting anyway..
4,Entertaining,"I like this book is very entertaining, there are some of the wall chapters such as the one about her meeting with an allien. But some of the stuff she wrote, she did back it up with reference from the bible and other books, so it's up to you to believe or not. In my opinion is an entertaining book to read your mind will wonder (if you read it with an open mind) after reading it."
2,No secrets here....,"The title is very misleading because there is hardly any secrets in this book. Ah, yes there's mysteries but there are tons of books on all the mysteries in the world and are covered in every single detail elsewhere. About most of the content here in this book is taken from those books and steals from those people who did the research. Now on to the secrets. There aren't any in this book. Only few revelations from the author's spirit guide (and that spirit is Christian too). The spirit guide doesn't reveal much, maybe because it doesn't know much either? There exists fallacious belief that when you die, you ultimately become the all-knowing part of god, no you don't! I take it that spirits don't know more than we do. Majority of people just simply want to believe in anything and this book may appeal to them."
5,It is a very awesome cd,"I have the cd, it is very awsome it has very fast songs, but some slow ones. They are cool, with very cool words and good meaning of the songs!"
4,These are fantastic,"These socks are incredible. They feel fantastic, although I'm not a big fan of seams at the edges of my toes but you get used to it. Not only do they make my legs feel better, they look good doing it. I don't know about every one else but when I've bought knee highs in the past, they start out great but by the middle of the day I'm stuck continuously having to pull them up or settle for them bunching up around my ankles cutting off my circulation. These stay up all day long.At first, I passed on these due to the price and tried a less expensive brand. The less expensive brand left alot to be desired so I bought two of the Jobst to try out. The Jobst are great. You definitely get what you pay for. I've had them for three weeks and just ordered three more pairs.If the seams for the toes went over the toes instead of at the end of the toes, I'd have given these a 5 star rating."
5,Very good value,"The Mr. Bar-B-Q Cast Iron fajita platter set is a very good value. It seems to be of the same quality as ones costing much more. I have only used the platters once so far since I finished seasoning them, but believe I will be happy for years to come."
3,Eh.. not bad,"It didn't suck out loud but the sound is annoying, the advice is the same advice you'd get in comedy clubs if you talk to the comics. The advice is from notable comics but nothing you can't learn from doing it. I've been doing comedy for almost 5 years now and it was a good one time watch.. I spent 96 cents on it.. well worth my money"
5,One of te greatest Chan movies,This is one of the greatest movies he has made! The action is great and it has some great stunts!(the roof drop is the best) Worth the money!
5,The Best !!!!!!!,"This is a typical Jackie Chan movie, unlike Rush Hour this one is full of stunts and fights. The last fight scene on top of the skyscraper is the best Jackie ever did and the stunts are pretty amazing too. The movie was partially shot in Rotterdam, Holland and guess what that's my hometown!!!!!!!! Jackie was invited there to attend a filmfestival and he saw some good places to shot his movie, luckelly for me so I got to see him up close and see him work. The movie becomes much more interessting because you recognize some places. Like the big carchase where the girl rides like crazy, one moment they are in another town and than she drives around the corner and they are in Holland driving down the steps into a shoppingcenter !! One of the two guys that Jackie fights whith on top of the skyscraper is Dutch (not the Chinese guy but the one that keeps his leg really high). The best movie Jackie made."
2,mediocre,"there is not one decent actor in this film, oher than chan. without him it would be a zero star. it was as if they were freshman in some acting school, well even if so, any decent teacher would have flunked them one and all. perhaps having such hjorrid actors makes chan look good...well good is relative, and saying he was good here, is being more than generous.as it is the plot is vitually non-existant, one fight scene was agonizingly long; taken place on the roof - if only they had actually jumped and saved us all from boredom.it was hard to figure out just what the nature of the film was...perhaps a comedy, but who knows.save your money, there are better chan films.how nice for the studios to have those with such low thresholds of being entertained...at least on this review there are a few others who see this film for what it is...the others will be happy watching inane films by inane actors."
1,The Michigan Murders,"This book is a sham. One of Collins' murder victims was a member of my family. Details in this book are wholly false. Items of so called ""fact"" regarding my family and the impact of the murder were fabricated. THIS IS NOT A LEGITIMATE ACCOUNTING OF THE TRADGEDY OF THESE MURDERS! Please do not be deceived. This book is garbage. Take it from one family member who lived through the nightmare of loosing a beautiful young woman to John Norman Collins"
2,A Lost Effect,"I really do not know why but for some odd reason this book did not have the same effect on me as I thought it would. I am from Michigan and really to tell you the truth after certain things that I have seen in my life or heard, a few murders in Ypsilanti do not bother me that much. It might because I read it after the WTC attack. A few lives seem insignificant compare to the thousands that were lost. So really this book lost a lot of effect that it should have had on me. I also heard about these incidents a long time ago but when I read the book it seemed kind of boring and almost as if it went into too much detail for my taste. The actual trial is what really hurt I hate reading trial scenes because they can be boring. The book though was not the worst that I ever read. But it definitely was not the best I have read."
3,Overrated but interesting,"The general themes and ideas presented in this book are interesting: That we are all part of a competitive social superorganism driven by memetic transmission. However, I find his understanding of certain concepts (e.g. stress, religion, philosophy) to be extremely limited.So while I found the book to be thought provoking, it was hard to overlook the cherry-picking of factual ""evidence"" and limited understanding of important concepts (see above)."
5,Eye opener....Don't let the name fool you!!,"I have to say, as a person who has always had a hard time understanding man's ""methods of maddness"", this book shed a interesting light on human behavior. I've read this book about 5 times (just to keep the concepts fresh in my mind) and have recomended this book to anyone looking for a little more information on the nature of man. To any scared of the title: Lucifer's name is simply used as a way to describe the kind of behavior examined in this book. Bloom confronts more of man's darker traits in this book and what better a name (or diety's name) to affix to these tendencies. I call this a must read for anyone looking for another angle from which to examine life."
5,This book will definitely change the way you look at the world.,"Basically, The Lucifer Principle provides a biological explanation for the phenomenon that is observable whenever people gather together in groups large or small: the larger the group, the more stupid they act. Why is this? It's the Lucifer Principle. You'll have to just read it. It also discusses super organisms and the memes that control them in a manner very similar to the way genes control the form of our own individual bodies."
3,"Not bad, not good","I do not dispute the force of this book, nor the arguments this book has caused. It certainly intrigued me at many points; however, I call into question Mr Bloom' villification of testosterone. Anyone who has ever required supplimental testosterone(certain cancer patients,etc) have levels higher than that of the most violent criminal offenders without the increase in aggression that Mr Bloom claims should happen. He points to a few well publicized incidents of ""roid rage"" which may have more to do cause wise with the mindset/culture of steroid abusers than the level of testosterone in their system.Read this book to have something to talk about rather than let it steer you."
3,.,"While there are some compelling and novel concepts in this book, Bloom's writing is too verbose and repetitive to really validate any of them. He begins with a concept-usually something vague like ""we're all part of a bigger organism"" or ""ideas are running the universe"" and proceeds to give a deluge of historical examples which he then analyzes in a way that conveniently backs his point. While it's great to see such a well-researched book, none of Bloom's examples really go any length to actually dilineating the mechanism by which any of his sociological/anthropolical principles pan out. In addition, for such a supposedly scientific book, Bloom makes an unhealthy amount of assumptions to further his points. Ie:""Humans grab at ideas because...they provide the comfort of companionship and mutual aid."" Do they?"
2,Won't be using this,"I found this DVD boring and the instructor had a strange attitude. She never smiled or had anything pleasant to say. The kriyas were rather advanced and she used the breath of fire too much. Part of the appeal in a workout DVD is the setup, and this one was bad."
4,great intermediate dvd,"I am not a kundalini expert but have been doing various forms of yoga for a few years (nothing too advanced). I wasn't too sure about the dvd when I started- but it seemed to be working on somethings that I don't get in a regular yoga class. So I decided to give it a month. I can say, a month later, that I can feel the difference and am very happy with the results. I just came back to see if she had another dvd out. The worst part of the cd is the kind-of new-agey talk but it's not that bad especially if you turn it down and put up your own music!"
5,A&D 1 lb tub ointment,This is outrageously priced. People...shop around ....I buy mine for half this price. I just bought 6 at 10 and some odd cents a piece. Don't let these people rob you on this product. I rate the actual item with 5 stars but this price is ridiculous.
4,A bit too much rubato,"Some songs on this album are fresh exposures to Hathaway's singing and soloing ability. ""Valdez in the Country"" is the centerpiece of the whole album, and exceeds the studio version.Other songs (""Someday We'll All Be Free"") are sung with way too much rubato and are not easy to follow as a result. Of course, the degree of the rubato is not as bad as, say, Shirly Horne (one wonders if she is going to fall asleep before she gets to the next chord), but there is diminshment just the same."
5,Fascinating foray into a fashion era,"I have only skim read this book so far, but I was instantly hooked by the over 200 B&W photos of men and women of the time period covered in this wonderful reference book. It provides a window, through photography, into a time long past, the fashions, styles and events and of course the clothes they wore. Each photograph is referenced with loving detail as to what each subject is wearing, doing and who they are - in itself an eminently useful historical reference, but with the addition of the photos it brings them all to vivid life despite the lack of colour. From a writers perspective this is a terrific reference volume and I look forward to reading it more in detail as well as wallowing in the fascinating photos that give the words life."
2,No depth at all,"generally the shows on history channel are pretty good, but not this one.It's a simple documentary of all the major event without any depth of analysis.It listed the unit number, location, date and even time -- which might be importantfor historians but definitely very boring for general public.The only chapter seems to be interesting to me is the last one: Nuremberg Trial.Even for record purpose, it's missing a lot of stuff. It talked nothingabout Russian battleground, nothing about China(WWII actually started at 1931when Japan invaded China).Even for western front line, it's also missing a lot of stuff, it covers groundwar pretty extensively, there are some coverage on Air war, but almost nothing onthe navy battle.The scenes are duplicated, same scene appears over and over again. Looks likesomeone just casually stitch them together.I wouldn't recommend it at all."
5,Changes my opinion on Tenkaichi games!!!,"Ok if you read my reveiw on the first Dragonball Z Tenkaichi game, you'd know that im not a huge fan of the camera angles or the over your shoulder gameplay. But i've decided to give the series a second chance by purchasing Daragonball Z Budokai tenkaichi 2 at a local Game Stop. I must say that im really impressed! Over 120 playable characters (unlike Tenkaichi one's 40), which is a huge improvement to me. Another thing is that the graphics are slightly better. The story mode is amazingly and satisfiyingly long, which I love in a video game. Even when your done with story mode there's still loads of stuff you can do so gameplay is endless. I now see why this game was placed runner up for 2006's Best Of E3 awards. Well, i've said what i've had to say. This game overall changed my opinion on Dragonball Z Budokai Tenkaichi. 5/5!!"
2,great game,"My brother loves this game so I purchased it for him, the game came in great shipping condition but the game would only work for about 2 minutes and then freezes. I instantly thought it was the game system since it was so old and we hadnt used it in a very long time since we now have the ps3, but he put in other games that we owned and they worked. Needles to say he was very bumbed I told him that we could return it but instead he wanted to try to take it to game stop and see if they could buff it, he paid about 8 dollars for them to do that and we brought it home and it worked....so hopefully we just got a slighly damaged one but it sucked we had to pay 8 extra bux for it"
1,The Progrock Store,"Unfortunately theproduct was never delivered to me so I am unable to review this item, however I found both Amazon and Progrock store to be extremely helpful and efficient and can only compliment them on their customer service levels."
4,From shyness to self-confidence,"I recommend this book because it provides sound advices for shy people.It's easier to make an impression when you have exciting things to talk about and share. To feel more knowledgeable and confident about everyday's life, and be more interesting when meeting others (dates, work, or friends' gathering) I joined services like [...]Breaking the barrier of silence and shyness opens doors to infinite possibilities."
1,Tires for motorcaddie,"The tires purchased were an exact fit. The price was substantially lower than the equipment supplier. Because of the size, the installation was taxing."
5,Impressive,"Wilson really is one of the ""twentieth centuries greatest thinkers."" This is a dense and demanding publication requiring a scientifically literate audience. It covers basic concepts from altruism, selfishness, and spite; including communication, aggression, social roles, sex, and parenting from ""invertebrates"" to vertebrates.Now, in 2007, this is really more of a 'classic'. For intro students, I'd first recommend getting your footing with ""Animal Behavior"" by Alcock, and *then progressing into more technically written publications like this one."
5,Talking Heads were a great group...,"I loved the dvd that the talking heads had a few years ago and the songs that were on it; when I heard this lp I had to get it....while it was selling at a great price, of course. This was worth the money to me as the songs were all great to listen to."
5,"""Once in a lifetime""",Great compilation of songs at an amazing price. If you liked the Talking Heads you'll love this greatest hits collection.
4,Friday Nights In America,"I was taken on a magical journey inside the phenomenon of high school football in our country. I loved the segment on ""The Muck Bowl"" in the Everglades of S. Florida. I was truly impressed with the story on De La Salle High School and their articulate and compassionate head coach.I was saddened, yet enlghtened, by the closing of so many high schools in western PA due to the loss of their steel mills. It really hit home when I saw towns that had lost their local prep team, also lose their identities. This was a revealing contrast. All in all, it taught me that millions of people invest large portions of themselves in the fate of their H.S. teams every friday night in the fall. A wonderful documentary. Well told."
5,The best moovie about casanova's soul.,"Fantastic sound track. Fantastic Photo. Light, customers, actors. I saw this film in brazilian television. I'm searching for this picture by 14 years. It's not available here in Brasil. I want to get a legended version."
5,Cheap!! So Yummy,I normally pay 3x the price for this exact one at the storeHave celiac's Disease and this is a life saver for me!!!
5,Woldn't want to live without it,i have been using this product for years. I don't like swallowing large tablets and this powder has everything i want with a wonderfl taste. I can tell when I don't take it. I like it stirred into milk and even better in my morning smoothie. I have been ordering this from Swanson's but with auto ship Amazon beat the price.
2,Once loved the product,"I reviewed this product around 2 years ago, prior to really looking at the food I was eating. I still like most of what is in Ultra Shake (Pea or Soy), however I stopped using it some time ago as they refuse to stop using processed sugars, pure crystalline fructose, therefore I dropped it from 4 stars to 2.I know there is a great debate going on around fructose as a whole, but when there are many more natural sweeteners available which many agree are actually beneficial...In an email to the company they justified their use of pure crystalline fructose has a healthy alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners (I admit that fructose is probably slightly better than artificial), a comment like this from a ""health food company, astonished me."
4,Great read and reference guide when you lose your way...,I truly loved this book! I read with a pencil in hand underlining different passages that spoke to me. Also a great reference guide when you catch yourself moving off course. I have already gone back to this book several times.
2,"Should be titled ""I Hate Bush and Other Thoughts""","For someone who seems to be very perceptive on human relations and seems to have a very close relationship with Jesus, this woman has a disproportionate and illogical hatred of Bush. Perhaps this comes from only having friends that think as she does. When she is writing about her son and her relatives, she is very good but the passages and one-liners about her Bush hatred are hard to get through. I suppose this sort of writing isi a hoot to her Salon readers but it will date the book quickly. When she writes about abortion she is doctrinaire and pedestrian."
2,"Good, but....","Although Anne Lamott is a skilled writer, she too often falls into her far-left rants which act as bumps in an otherwise smooth road. She has no doubt led an interesting life and I have enjoyed her other books (which are full of great insights on faith and what it means to be religious), but this one's a little too nutty for me."
2,Occasionally Christian,"It's difficult sometimes to find the Christianity in this book, where Lamott suggests (imagines?) that Jesus was awful as a teenager, that abortion isn't really all that bad, and that we should pray to Mary. I wonder where those ideas are justified in the Bible.And Lamott's frequent rants about Bush-Cheney were also a distraction.Lamott's simplistic theology says everyone is free to find their own path. How New Age! But Jesus is not just Savior, He is also Lord, and His requirements are more demanding than Lamott allows for.Lamott says, ""There is not much truth being told in the world."" Exactly. Being truthful is important. And one truth that should be acknowledged is that being Christian isn't some touchy-feely exercise in spiritual superficiality.Lamott's book of essays was superficially entertaining in many places, but disappoints on a deeper level."
3,"No thank you, no good.","I read another one of Anne's books. The first one I did not like much, and really did not want to read this one, but when you already own it, you feel you must with 16 dollars into the book. It was some repeating of stories I really did not like in the first place, there were a few highlights or good moments, but not enough. I still feel bad for her, but most times I was like ""get over it."" Now I loved Donald Miller's book, which was along the same mindset, but he seemed deep or maybe just a man. Sorry Anne, you are twice if not more the writer that I am, but I was just not into the book."
4,The lesson is in the slog,"A series of snack-sized yet nourishing essays on topics ranging from religion (but in a not-in-your face-kind-of-way) and politics to relationships and recovery, Grace (Eventually) subtly highlights what ultimately matters most in life. With honesty, humor, and humility, Anne reminds us that although we can't avoid the messiness of life, there are ways to stay awake, alert, forgiving, and somewhat sane as we stumble through all the muck. As she points out in her Lamont-language, grace and healing are not ""abracadabra kinds of things"" but instead ""it's clog and slog and scootch...the lesson is in the slog."" Perhaps the key to life is not in avoiding the muck--but in learning how to first plod through it and then gracefully de-gunk. (Eventually.)"
1,Not what the description made it out to be....,"I bought this in the airport on a long layover and threw it away 4 chapters in. What I thought would be a nice book about how everyone finds their own faith and grace, was sort of about faith, but I couldn't get past her political hatred.....who cares, this was supposed to be about finding grace, not how she hates George Bush. I found it too distracting, definitely not what I thought it would be."
5,Great for my Pre-school Sports fan,"This is awesome. We have the Video Now JR for our three year old. He loves all the cartoons but he is also a HUGE basketball fan. This was one of his favorite things this Christmas. Now he can watch ""big boy"" shows on his Video Now Jr. Hats off to Playskool for making the PVDs interchangeable."
3,It's nice movie for Vinod Khanna's fan,"Gaddaar film was released in 1973 by director and producer Harmesh Malhotra. Main cast in this film are Vinod Khanna, Yogita Bali,And Ranjeet."
4,Good Reference,Provides a solid guide to hymn playing. This book provides the ground work and essential skills one needs to play hymns.
5,Great movie.,"This movie stars Kenny Rogers. Easy viewing, fun to watch with the six pack (six children) stripping and rebuilding Bruster Bakers ( Kenny Rogers) Race car. This is a really good movie for the whole family."
4,Good Ol' Rocky Top,"I grew up being obsessed with this movie. My brother and I would sit, dreaming of meeting sleazy race car drivers, shocked by the one kid's trashy language ""Toad suckin' honkey bum,"" I think it was. I love Kenny Rogers, I, for some gross reason, find the bad guy race car driver extremely attractive, and I think the kid who sings ""Good ol' Rocky Top"" deserves a Grammy. I also remember loving Diane Lane (Breezy, Heather) and the kid with a lisp . Sure, it's not a movie that makes you think much, but it sure is enjoyable for some reason. It might just be because I grew up watching it (on Beta,) so please don't go buy it thinking it's going to be incredible."
2,SIX PACK,"OK MOVIE, THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT. IT'S OK. JUST RENT IT AS YOU PROBABLY WON'T WATCH IT AGAIN"
4,Early Jerry Jeff at its best,"You can definately tell, in listening to this album and more recent ones, how Walker's voice has matured and his music progressed. The CD contains many early Jerry Jeff essintials, including the original Little Bird, I Makes Money Money dont Make Me, and my favorite, Maybe Mexico. A number of the songs reflect Walker's discontent with his place in life as a young musician--this is Jerry Jeff Walker's music before he found his click singing songs about Texas."
4,First Body Wipes,"This is my first set of body wipes I've purchased, so I don't have much to base it on. I bought these as a quick wipe down when I got off of work. The outer few were a little on the drier side, but as I'm moving in they are getting noticeably damper.It does it's job, so 4/5 stars."
4,Great Sippy Cup!,"I switched to Born free bottles after a horrible experience with the new BPA-free Avent bottles. My son was excusively breasftfed up until his first birthday and now that he's one, I use this sippy to give him homo milk. Its the only sippy he'll take.Ive had no problems with leaking. Ive ordered a few more of these and some replacement spouts. The holes on the spouts are actually starting to tear up after about 6/7 months of use."
2,Leaks!,"We have several of these cups, and they all tend to leak milk from the base of the nipple. Also, they are not leak-proof from the opening of the nipple--as our daughter walks through the house she leaves a trail of milk behind her. Overall, I would try another brand if I needed to purchase another cup."
3,Disappointment,"Since my daughter was born, I was using born free products. We bought this sippy cup to replace bottles. She is 15 months old. The sprout is soft ..she liked it ...but somehow this cup keeps leaking even if I squeze it tight. but she likes it so we keep using it for now..."
1,Surprise!,"I bought these cups awhile ago and am trying to get my boys off their bottles. Today, they actually drank from them and thought, oh great, then the leakage started. I have no idea how they leak through the cap and cup, not from the ""nipple"". They have never been on the dishwasher, so the fit should be perfect. I had 2 trails of milk to the kitchen, 1 soaked shirt and a puddle on the rug. Not pleased!! It had such potential!!"
1,Defective right out of the box!,"I purchased 2 of these, one got plugged in and the other put into a closet for future use. The one I plugged in after 3 days became extremely hot and smelled up our entire building like rotten eggs. My initial thought was we over charged it until I read the label that says ""keep plugged in, it cannot be over charged."" Now Schumacher, National Tool Warehouse and Amazon tell me it is my responsibility to pay to ship it back for replacement......and I never used. Buyer beware"
4,Seems like a good product,"Our truck spends most of its time, up to three or for weeks at a time, parked deep in a garage here in Manhattan. Our battery is a couple of years old, so I figure that having this jumper is cheap insurance.I like the design of the jumper and if it gets me out of a jam, I'll up it to five stars."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!,This is an awesome jumpbox! I am a professional marine mechanic and use this box almost everyday(believe me I have used other cheap jumpboxes). The long cable length is hard to find on other jumpboxes and is a great feature on this product. I would recomend this product to anyone looking for a reliable and great priced professional grade tool.
1,internal charger stopped working after 3 weeks,"horrible customer service , had to ship back to manufacturer and wait 3 weeks for replacement unit buy something else"
5,inspirational riverra,"It is an excellent cd. It brings joy to the soul at a time in your life when things seem to be blue. There's nothing like siping on some hawaiian punch on the rocks listening to New Beginnings by Joel McCray on your patio with the wind blowing just right. At that moment, you can feel just you and Jesus doing the 2-step. Praise God for Joel blessing us with his gospel jazz talent!"
1,A BOOK THAT FAILS THE READER AND DOESNT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE,"Apart from its title, the book itself superficially describes certain important issues in the work place. It merits attention for its ""timeliness"" but fails in its ""prescriptions"" for success in the upcoming millenium. Business per say is much more complicated than the book defines it to be, and improvement within the workplace depends on many other factors that the book at best alludes to. All in all, it simplifies everything rather than show the specific nuances that exist within the issues. It brashly treats such issues with zero tolerance. As so, this book deceives the reader, a classical work of appearence and reality. It appears to do a good job, but in reality it's just another mediocre book that summarizes the work of better books. Its bibliography, however, is worth a peek. Therein will the reader quench his desire to understand what this book fails to explore well."
4,An Authentic Storyteller.,"Mr. Hopkins is a natural storyteller. His unpretentious, easy-going literary style and his obvious affection for storytelling make his stories accessible, intimate, and fun. If Mr. Hopkins would produce a steady stream of similar stories, he would find an eager and happy audience."
4,Good workout,"This DVD was a good addition to my collection of workout DVDs. It is a nice length if you are hoping to get in a quick workout. It is a challenge, without being overly difficult - I would consider myself in good shape."
5,A remarkable bildungsroman,"Canetti describes his travels as a wealthy spanish jew around many different european countries preceding and during the great war. His fiercely intellectual mother, uber-capitalist uncles, and antisemitic neighbors make for an incredibly interesting portrait."
4,Disturbing,"Wow, this movie wasn't what I expected at all. Any movie that is dialogue driven and holds up is alright in my book. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not for most of this movie. I'm a big fan of the old Twilight Zone show and this reminded me of that."
2,Machine Quilting Primer,I found this book out=dated and therefore didn't find it of much help. I did gain two stencils that may be helpful on a future project.
5,"A Light Fantasy Novel, but don't get me wrong","As Nix's first novel, this book is astounding. The story is new and creative and takes the readers through a magnificent journey through the mind of The Ragwitch, the villain of this story. The characters are fun and inventive, and the land is created with clear imagination and thought. Each page provides readers with magic and mystery, as they unravel the secrets of the Ragwitch's realm, while striving to stop her from her evil intentions. I would suggest this book mostly to a younger audience, from around 8-13, though I was 15 when I read it and I love the story, along with all of Nix's other books. He is definately a new author to discover."
2,:(,"AWW Garth Nix I'm so disappointed :'( truly, I am. Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen were such good books but The Ragwitch was really bland. At frist I thought that it'd be really good, despite my friend saying it was going to be rubbish, and then... I read it. I couln't even finish it. I'm really sorry, I wish I didn't have to be such a kill joy but this book is really bad. I'm not going to be sour and give it a 1 but if you've read Sabriel, Lirael and Abhorsen then you'll know what I mean. If you havn't read thease books, then do so instead of this one because they are a hundered times better!"
4,Filling in a wide gap,"First the author is a HONEST writer. Its a wild guess, but I am pretty sure it must be accurate. Second its typical American writing, that is, sincere, to the point, friendly and concentrates on concepts.An essentail reading material for those who are bothered about how the whole thing (Net) took off and about the great minds behind it. An apt and much-needed tribute to the founding ""fathers"" of the Internet and the Web. Remember every great work today on the Web and Net (incl. Amazon.com) sits on the great work of these ""Souls of the Internet."""
2,Angel Indeed,"he main flaw of the love story is that you simply don't connect with the characters individually, or even when they are together. The graph of the narrative is low as the film begins and is the same till the intermission point. Just like Sonal's condition, you desperately want the film to get better. And it does! After the interval, the twist shown elevates the narrative to a great extent. Just as you feel Ganesh has finally steadied the sinking ship, it plummets and again goes haywire. The hurried climax doesn't help.There are flimsy scenes like Abhay taking on several policemen single handedly. Don't the police officers have guns? Then there's Sonal doing a Mere Khwabon mein jo aaye tackily. The numerous songs, most of them shot in foreign locations don't add any value. Amjad Nadeem's music is passable. Aseem Bajaj's cinematography is decent. Nilesh Naik's editing is good."
5,Awesome color and variety! Great learning tool.,"My 18 month old loved this book the first time he saw it. We are pleased at the number and types of animals inside! There are farm animals, zoo animals, pets, etc. - many of which he recognizes already, but there are plenty for him to learn as he gets older, too. The pictures are beautiful and clear and give us a lot to look at and talk about. The combination of familiar animals like cats and dogs and more obscure ones like goats gives him something to feel proud of while he works on learning the harder ones.We bought this book based on seeing My Big Truck Book and were not disappointed at all - they are both great!"
5,Grandaughter's delight,"My grandaughter is 7 months old and LOVED this book. She would kick her little feet with delight as we turned to each new page.It is colorful and wonderful for teaching animal recognition, eye hand coordination as you turn the pages and point to animals, and would be a perfect venue to start teaching animal sounds .This book is worth every cent."
5,10 years and 4 kids Later,We got this book right after my son was born 10 years ago. With each of our 4 boys this book has been a favorite. The pictures are great and the book holds up well through all the love it gets. The pages are coated so that they are easy to wipe off. A must when little hands are handling it so much.
3,Colorful large book,I bought this book for my grandson.I like the pictures but was over-all disappointed.There wasn't as much description of each animal as I would have liked.I would have enjiyed more chances to explore letters and sounds of the animals.I would not recommend this for anyone trying to teach a little one his letters
2,Blades are POT METAL - not hardened steel,"Busted two blades in about 15 seconds trying this out on 16 GA steel. Cuts 22 just fine, I am skeptical that it'll cut 18. The outer blades may be steel but the inner one - the business end - is cheap-ass pot metal."
4,Electricity from Boston to Miami,"Though not in the top tier of Parker's books, this is an intriguing detective novel. Part of the story is very sad and, unfortunately, may be reflective of some all too common happenings within today's households. Of course, this sadness is balanced with some intriguing detective work and a dynamism between Jesse and a sexy detective in Miami."
2,trash,"If you like an entire book of sexually obsessive people, this one is for you! It's more like Jackie Collins than Robert Parker."
4,love stone,"jesse stone is a good read EXCEPT, for all the forlorning he does about his wife. For goodness sake get a life, after all you have a different woman, or a fallback in every story. DROP JENN!!!!"
4,A quick and easy read,"This was an easy book to read. The plot was good and easy to follow. The characters were also true to life as was the depiction of a rich, scum filled lifestyle.The book also had short 'breezy' chapters which made it a quick read, something that I appreciate.I would highly recommend this item."
1,Why I only saw Schemes once,"I have to say this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. When we finally figured out what seemed to be the plot of the first half, we were again befuddled as the second half of the movie appeared to have nothing to do with the first half. Characters found out things, had epiphanies, seemed surprised and all, but it was difficult to tell why they were surprised, all they did was see a beat up car! The acting was particularly shoddy, but it was well done compared with the choppy editing, confusingly split screens, and lack of cohesive plot or convincing conclusion. Lots of people standing around in the same room at the end of a movie does not an oscar win. Unfortunetly, neither does it satisfy the watcher, or even give them a clear idea of what they just watched. This wasn't an artsy film either where you expect that. I left with the feeling someone took a pair of scissors to the reel of a movie, and I was watching what was left."
5,Still going strong!!,"If you've liked Killing Joke in the past, don't be put off by a few of the bad reviews that are posted here. [...] This is probably KJs best release since Pandemonium. You will not find much melody here. Nor will you find virtuoso guitar solos and the like (go listen to your old Yes albums, if that's what pleases you). You will find, however, overt sexual/tribal hooks accompanied by an overlay of industrial-metal-rave cacophony. While most musicians their age, and most people for that matter, are willing slaves to the military-entertainment complex, these guys still have a finger on the pulse of an anger and resistance that must be maintained at all costs."
5,It's a Funny Funny Book!,"Joe Adams may be the funniest new voice in the South. The stories in this collection all make me laugh out loud, and I find myself reading them over and over again. Not only did I buy one for myself but have given it as gifts to friends who need a few laughs (and a few who didn't)"
5,a wonderful cd!,"This is a wonderful cd, in any language. If, however, you are a student of Italian you will especially enjoy these songs. I love Ancora Un Minuto Di Sole. I recommend this album to everyone."
5,Great Gift of Friends that are New Grandmothers.,I first purchased this book for my Mother when I had my first child. She has been adding to it for now 27 years. I purchase new books for friends that are New Grandmother to start on ASAP.
5,X'mas Magic with Donny n Marie,This dvd was n is a wonderful trip down memory lane for me..Nothing beats an osmonds x'mas gathering...magical!
3,Not as Christmasy as we were hoping.,"This had quite a few NON-Christmas songs. Something was missing. I was looking for Donny & Marie Christmas nostalgia to share with my kids. I liked that the whole family is in it, but when the wives got to sing they should have been given better Christmas outfits than different colored SWEATshirts! Sheesh! There were some silly, natural moments, which was nice, but not enough Christmas!"
1,Weddings for rich grownups should be the name!,"I must not have read the same book as the other people who reviewed this because I got nothing out of this book but a huge panic attack! It made me all stressed out and wasn't helpful in the least! I take that back, I learned one thing from the book -- the real name and origin of the wedding march. If you want to have a simple wedding and just want a book that will give you the breakdown of what is what DON'T buy this book -- instead, buy ""Weddings for Dummies"" THAT is a great reference!"
3,Great if you want to shoot indoors all the time.,"I received the camera and tried it out. It takes nice pictures, is easy to use. The one thing that I really dislike is the fact that it does not have a view finder! Taking pictures outdoors is almost impossible. When you are out in the sunlight finding your subject using only the LCD display sucks! So much so that I am going to send the camera back and look for something else."
4,good Zoom,Great 6x zoom and image stabilization. Nice wide screen format for TV playback.Poor macro. Unable to take pictures of items less than ~2inGrainy low light pictures even at iso 1250. Marketing materials should say iso1250 instead of iso3200.Size bigger than it expected but smaller camera has only 3x zoomNeeds a speaker on video playbacks.
4,Good Pictures and easy to use,"I have had my Panasonic LZ7 for about 2 weeks now I am quite happy with it. The low(7.2) mega pixels does not really bother me too much as I will not be printing extra large pictures. The quality of the photos are really good. What im really impressed with is the 6X optical zoom, (most small cameras average around 3X-5X zoom) you can really get nice close ups of animals and other things that you can't normally get close to, and there is no picture noise even with full zoom at 6X. The camera is bigger than the average point and shoots, but with the large lens and the 2AA batteries it takes, this is to be expected. Battery life is decent, I use re-chargeables though. All in all, good value, for the money.."
4,Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ7K 7.2MP Digital Camera,"Great camera for the price I paid on Amazon(around $170), 25% less than most of retailers. This is an entry level camera but great for family photos. The only down side is the camera is a little bulky, I will recommend a slim model if you have more budget."
4,A very good camera for good light,The camera behaves very well in good light.in dim lighting the noise --and noise reduction-- effects make a bit of post processing necessary.I really like the optical zoom and the small size.Battery life is good for a 2 AA battery camera.A good camera for spontaneous shooting.
3,Mehhh,"The image stabilizing zoom and its red eye reduction is great, but it seems like no matter what setting I choose, my pictures never seem bright enough. It's also a little bulkier than expected, and the way the menu options are set up it seems hard to change anything quickly for a spontaneous but great picture."
5,Great camera,"We have only had this camera for a month or so, but took it on a European trip and it takes remarkable pictures. we are still learning all the things it does, so I feel confident we'll be even more satisfied when we get to use all the bells and whistles!"
2,No Viewfinder,"I got my new camera and was pretty excited. I did have alittle trouble with the software install and I find the camera alittle cheap feeling, but I figured it was pretty inexpensive. I kept the camera for a couple of weeks, but could not get use to not having a view finder. My job requires I take picutres outside and when its really sunny, its hard to take pictures. Perhaps others have this figured out. I ended up getting the Canon model that is similiar with a view finder. Will see how it works out."
5,Excellent camera and superb service!,Length:: 3:14 MinsPanasonic DMC-FZ7 6MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)
4,It is good for the 1st time leader,This is a good for a 1st time leader. Many teamwork and get to you know you games. If you are new to scouts this is a good book to purchase.
4,Ex-slaves share their stories. Fascinating and surprising.,"We Lived in a Little Cabin in the Yard is a quick read, but it gives ample food for thought. During the Great Depression, writers interviewed surviving ex-slaves and this book is a collection of their stories. Although the reason for the inclusion of the specific stories in the book is that all lived in Virginia at one point in their lives. The feelings shared pertaining to emancipation were quite interesting, and like many who are survivors of abuse, some of these tragic people seemed to feel some attachment to their abusers (slave owners.) Their indifference to the Civil War was unexpected, and their lack of direction after emancipation is something not often written about. The shame that we experience as a previously slave-owning culture is unearthed in the process of reading this little book, and I somehow felt as if I were doing something wrong by reading it. I don't think I'll ever forget it."
2,Hoping for more,"Relatively new to Ashtanga yoga, I purchased this CD in hopes of practicing at home without and instructor and while away. Unfortunately, after waiting a long time for its arrival, I found it dissapointing. I believe she teaches the primary series slightly differently than do my teachers or reference books, and the pace isn't for me either. I am trying something new."
3,The Marble Man,"I must say that the Marble Man is a good read. I can say this from two perspectives. First, I read the book and thouroughly enjoyed it. Second, Dr. Connelly was my professor and advisor at the University of South Carolina from 1986 until 1988. I cannot express enough what an experience it was to sit in one of his classes and listen to his lectures. It was like being transported back in time to the battle or period we were covering that day. The students would wait with anticipation before he arrived and didn't want to leave when the class was over because the transportation back in time would end when we'd leave the classroom. I remember Dr. Connelly's assessment of Lee quite well. While Lee was a good general, he did tend to be wasteful with resources and has become overrated with time. I strongly encourage the reader of this review to read anything written by Dr. Connelly. He was an amazing man."
5,A poetic ode to life and living,"This is an excellent book on the age-old goal of living in the moment and enjoying life. The language is poetic and inspires one to live life more fully, and the book also contains numerous examples and practical advice on how to do this."
4,Why buy new???,"Wasn't really in a rush, but the book came within the window for delivery.Looks and feels new. Popped from the book backing in one place. What I wantedis the content of the book and this book was the perfect answer to a not so easybook to find. Would buy more from this seller, since I'm looking for the kind of book a lot."
3,This book is a confused conglomeration of new-age clap trap,This book is a confused conglomeration of new-age clap trap. This might be OK for people who have a totally subjective view of reality - Pretty sure there are some of those folks out there. In short -- waste of money.
4,Europe 1972,"As a big fan of the Europe '72 shows, I as many others got into these shows because they were Pigpen's finest. The good lovin' jams were exceptional throughout the tour and the one on this show is the amazing highlight of the show...20min of pigpen bluesy bliss. The Chinatown Shuffle is wonderful and so is the Dark Star jam. The vocals on some of the songs could be better but they don't really detract from this killer show. The lesser point of the show is the playin' in the band -- featuring horrible donna screaming...hide your glass objects, they are likely to break. All in all its a wonderful show and definetly worth your investment if for no other reason than.......it contains another one of Bob Weir's infamously corney jokes!(its been awhile since I last visited my tape collection, but I believe my favourite pigpen good lovin' is on the tivoli show, I want to say 4-14-72 -- those are some good shows to dig up)"
3,just okay,"I have many GD albums, dicks picks, etc. and I have to say that this'72 set is just okay.Keith Godchaux is new with the band and it sounds like it.Donna Jean just screams.and over all the vocals are off .There are plenty of other great choices out there."
4,ABBA mania!,I have always enjoyed ABBA so this collection is a welcome addition to my music collection. These are actually the first ABBA albums I've owned so much of the music was new to me and I have thoroughly enjoyed the collection.
3,-- or were they?,"Not as hilarious as the compilers think -- and it's very easy to disagree with some of their choices for bad reviews. So then you're reading the book, thinking how stupid and silly the critics were -- and then you're presented with a supposed ""bad review"" of a classic movie you nonetheless hated, along with the supposedly misguided critic. They also seem to take special pleasure in knocking John Simon, and for no really good reason.Overall, interesting, but hardly authoritative."
2,BUT IS IT WORTH BUYING?,"This is one of those books that sounds like it's worth keeping, but isn't, really. It is, after all, a fun idea--reviews of the critics who originally trashed the world's finest films when they first came out--but this isn't the kind of book you'd want to shell a coupla bucks for. My advice--bum it off your friends or borrow it from the library; it's not worth the money."
2,"Sequel to ""Meet the Parents""","Now that Gaylord Focker has met his in-laws, he must introduce them to his parents, the touchy-feely, let-it-all-hang-out duo played by Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman. She is a sex therapist and he is a stay-at-home dad, in contrast to Gaylord's in-laws, the former CIA straight arrow (Robert DeNiro) and his long-suffering wife (Blythe Danner). There is potential for humor here, but unfortunately the movie-makers go to the lowest common denominator and choose to saturate the film with tasteless sexual innuendoes and bathroom humor. There are a few funny moments, but unfortunately they come all too seldom in this star-studded flop of a movie. Take my advice, and skip this one."
3,Great Sequel,this is a great followup to the 1st movie. It's not better then the original but still delivers the goods. worth buying.
2,Another failed sequel,"You know, I actually didn't think the first one wasall that funny, but this one failed badly. Why? Well,it was predictable. The most funny parts came from thelittle boy and the animals. The adults in this movieall sucked.... Ben's wife looked like she is on drugsand ""The Fockers"" were very unfunny.They should have gave bigger roles to the animal andused the kid alittle more because they gave what littlefun there actually was. Didn't think this film shouldhave had a part 2 anyway.... Should have left it alone.But Hollywood just couldn't resist could they? Blah!"
5,THE BYRNES' MEET THE FOCKERS,"MEET THE FOCKERS (2004)Universal StudiosRelease Date: December 22, 2004Runtime: 110 minutes.Directed by:Jay RoachProduced by:Jay Roach....producerRobert De Niro....producerJane Rosenthal....producerCast:Ben Stiller....Gaylord ""Greg"" FockerRobert De Niro....Jack ByrnesTeri Polo....Pamela Martha ByrnesBlythe Danner....Dina ByrnesBarbra Streisand....Rosalind ""Roz"" FockerDustin Hoffman....Bernard ""Bernie"" FockerSpencer & Bradley Pickren....Little JackAlanna Ubach....Isabel VillalobosRay Santiago....Jorge VillalobosPLOT SUMMARY:After being given permission to marry the daughter of a retired CIA agent, Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker, his fiancee Pam, and her parents travel Miami, Florida to meet his quirky liberal parents, Roz and Bernie Focker. The film features a new character, Little Jack, who is Pam's nephew, and Jack and Dina's grandchild. Jack tries to nurture his namesake grandchild."
1,"please, not a third time!","Gee, it's pretty sad to see actors of this caliber, who've been in so many memorable movies, get mired in this kind of horrible dreck.But, this is what really offended me: in ""Meet the Parents"" there was one trained animal to provide a few cute jokes. In this sequel, not only did they feel the need to throw in a pathetic looking dog for a few more ""America's Funniest Videos"" style laughs, they effectively used a child in the role of a third ""trained animal"". Sick. They must have figured that it worked well with ""Mini-Me"" in the ""Austin Powers"" sequel, so why not stick Robert DeNiro with a similar sidekick? The people who made this movie deserve a swift kick (or two) in the pants."
3,Sequels are never as good....,"At least that's what most people say, and I'd have to say that motto rings true with ""Meet the Fockers."" I wouldn't place blame on the actors - they all did a great job. I loved Barbara Streisand as a sex therapist - her casual nature in the film was a great contrast for the Byrnes parents.The problem with the movie lied in the fact that it was somewhat contrived after seeing the first one. The lines weren't as good, and overall not as funny despite the all star cast. Hope this review helps."
1,Almost as bad as the first,"I never understood why anyone thought the first movie was funny-Pam's refusal to stand up for her boyfriend didn't make me laugh, it just made me wonder why Greg bothered to try. The second is almost as bad, and I think the fact that it has such an all star cast makes it even more of a disappointment.Don't waste the $3 to rent this, get Eurotrip or something."
2,Saw the Movie was not impressed.not too funny sadly.,"This movie is not as funny as the first sadly, where the first meet the parents movie was hilarious this one lacks it, it's not that this movie is not Funny. it is. but not as much as the 1st one. Then you add in the new cast of characters it just didn't do it for me sadly. It could have been better, there is a 3rd installment rumored to come as of this writing which will be about the kids, let's hope it's better and funnier. Pass this one, go for the 1st. I rented it and was disappointed."
2,"Great humor, but......","This movie has a lot of funny moments. I liked how DeNiro's character loosened up in the end. The only part that ruined the movie for me was the presence of sexuality in almost every scene. Streisand's character is a sex therapist. She has books and statues all over the place. She constantly turns the conversation toward sexual things. She and her husband are constantly thinking about, talking about, and starting sex. I feel sad that people think that sex has to be part of everything. Comedies such as this would be just as funny without sex, but they always insist on adding it. At least the first one is better."
4,One Babe and Babs Save This Sequel,"I am not a big fan of ""Meet the Parents."" I wasn't looking foward to a sequel until I heard the casting of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. I knew that these two additions would be a happy addition to the mix and compliment the rest of the cast.The sequel itself is funnier and fresher for some reason. Its not just a one joke movie, it's more developed. Hoffman and Streisand are fabulous. Babs has never been funnier, and I wouldn't be suprised if she gets an oscar nomination. Hoffman is equally great. The real scene stealer is a baby. He steals EVERY scene he's in. Also the pets steal one scene. Lotsa laughs abound in this movie. It is one of the best comedies of the year, and I was pleasantly suprised of how good it was."
3,Funny,"I thought this movie was funny. But after a while, like all other times, I got tired of Ben Stiller. He's funny to a certain extent after a while it's like alright enough already. But i did enjoy it. Especially that baby."
3,Has its moments...,"First and foremost, this is not a movie I would go out of my way to see. I wouldn't pay to see it at a theatre (Though I did), I wouldn't own it, I might rent it. If it were on TV, and there was nothing else on, I'd watch it. There is something to the sophomoric humor and screeching annoyance of Barbara Streisand that simply irks me the wrong way.That said, I am forced to admit that this wasn't a poor film. The cinematography was adequate; this is not an artsy film. The acting was fine, Robert De Niro was okay, but the teeth and edginess of his character was removed. Stiller continues his reign as king of the awkward moment. There are plenty of laughs, but none that one couldn't find in a much more accessible form on network sitcoms. Though I do not think this was a great film, and though I do not recommend this film, at the theatre I attended in small town Minnesota, the movie received applause. There is something eternal to poop and bosom jokes."
1,The title sets the level,"The title was a stupid joke. I assumed the movie would not surmount that level.But given the quality of the actors, and that the listing as I got it had five--count 'em five--stars, I took a chance and saw it.Best I can say is that it was almost as bad as I expected. Not quite a zero-star rating, given Streisand, Hoffman, De Niro and Blythe Danner.Based on my judgment, I am recommending against it. Some audience members laughed out loud as I grimaced."
3,"Better than the First, but Still Misses the Mark","Meet the Fockers is much better than the first movie, Meet the Parents, which had its moments, but soon became annoying. All the characters are back in this second installment and then some.Highlights:1. Robert De Niro2. Robert De Niro's Turbo RV3. Dustin Hoffman4. Owen Wilson5. The Signing BabyLowlights:1. Ben Stiller2. Gaylord Focker and his fiance (too passive)This is supposed to be a family film, but it is a little mature for age 13 and below. There are sexual overtones throughout, and a little cursing."
1,Disappointment,"After seeing ""Meet the Parents"" my expectations were high for this sequel. The star power present in this film could not salvage the story line. Some very funny moments but overall a huge disappointment!"
5,GREAT Movie,"This was a great ""sequel"" movie. I thought it started slow but once it developed its own plot and strayed away from the first, it was hilarious. I've never heard so many people laugh in a movie theater."
3,"Eh, Not my Favorite","I could take or leave this movie. To me it was not as good as Meet the Parents. While Barbra Stresiand and Dustin Hoffman played unique characters, the movie used them too heavily at the sacrifice of the story. Near the end I was growing weary of sexual humor and wanted the movie to end. It's not that I don't enjoy a good joke, but The Fockers tries too hard to be one big joke. The story is weak and virtually non-existant. I didn't find myself laughing much."
4,Freestyle,Cant go wrong with the ness... Freestyles are always on point. Hope to hear more from them in the future.
4,A good book for kids that like scary stories!,"The Baba Yaga is an important character in Slavic folklore, a powerful witch, and the antagonist of many a story. In this story, the magical young child Tishka (which, by the way, is an old name meaning honoring God, or honored by God) is tricked into accompanying the Baba Yaga to her home, where the witch plans to eat him! But, honest and virtuous Tishka defeats the witch.This is a very good story, and the illustration work is quite good, adding to the old-time Slavic feel of the story. It's a good book for kids that like scary stories!(Review of Baba Yaga by Katya Arnold)"

5,This Vs Swiss,"Compared to my old Swiss Army knife, this thing is SLICK!!!! The blade had no trouble slicing up the carpet in my room. I'm not used to the thumb studs yet, but I am working on it. The locking mechanism feels very secure. There is no play in the blade."
5,Excellent adaptation of a classic,"Stephen Fry has beautifully adapted The Count of Monte Cristo, a French classic, in that beautifully charming and oh-so-English manner of his. People who normally enjoy his work will be sure to love this. The characters are charming and very human, the tale is expertly woven together and the prose drips with Fry's signature wit."
1,piece of junk,"I got sick using this product. I haven't had congestion like this for years. The ions are harmful so close to your mouth. I would so love to return this product, but am told I can't. germ guardian ps-100 personal air purifier is a health hazard."
2,Don't waste your money,"As far as I can tell, the product would probably work ... IF you are allowed to use it! On a recent trip (12/25/07) on Continental airlines, the flight attendant stopped me as I boarded the plane and told me I had to turn it off. I talked to a pilot later who said there had been incidents where these devices had been rigged with explosives. So, I can't recommend spending $30 on a product that you can't use for airline travel, which is mainly how I wanted to use it."
4,Good Mental Popcorn,"Looking for socially redeeming fare? Look elsewhere, because this is NOT it! This is in the best tradition of ""bodice ripping"" romance, with explicit love scenes and scintillating men and women."

4,Great Item. A few buts,"I thought this was soo funny and had to have it. so when it arrived it look really great... BUT 2 THINGS ONLY, and not bad. It could have been bigger measueres about 3in by 2 1/4. And a nickle should actually be able to go through the slot. it is wide enough but not long enough. a nickle only goes 1/4 the way through."
5,really neat scale,sorry I cannot be much help as it was given as a gift. so far I have not heard how they like it.
3,Decent...,"I love the Get Up Kids and ""Something To Write Home About"" is one of my favorite albums, but it seems like they were trying a little too hard to sound different on this release. Some of the songs just sound flat and boring, the others sound like 20-something year olds trying to be a rock band from the 70's.This album does have the standard Mathew Pryor vocals though, some good songs (Stay Gone, High As the Moon, Campfire Kansas, Hannah Hold On), and beautiful artwork.I can understand how they'd like to grow and expand their musical style, but this just seems forced and the result of being told they're brilliant a few too many times."
5,What?,"I don't know what's with all the complaining about this album. I am a long-time get-up kids fan, and I think this was a great album for them. It showed immenses artistic depth, a great amount of atmosphere, and very solid songwriting through-out. Unfortunately, they only made one VERY different album after this, and then they broke up on the 4th of July. Definetly my favorite song is Walking on a Wire."
5,GREAT value and also big fun!,"You really get a lot for what you pay for. The foil-rhox it comes with is worth about 6 bucks, so you could argue that you only really paid four bucks for it!The software it comes with is great. The educational video is very nicely done. It's entertaining and very informative. The tutorials in the software are basically games, and get progressively more complex as they move along. Even once I understood how Magic was played and had the rules downpacked (which didn't take long), the tutorials are still fun to play because they're essentially like playing Magic against an opponent.If you've been wanting to learn Magic the Gathering, you can't go wrong by starting here. You'll have a lot of fun doing so, and feel good knowing that you got a ton for you money!"
2,"In a techno world, 2 years is a very long time.","Frustrated with trying to run Microsoft's power hungry monster Flightsim 2000 on my PII, 450mhz system , I thought I'd give '98 a try. Frame rate was explosive but it's anemic virtual world left me flat. Flightsim '98 is only a couple years old but in todays high end visual universe, it looks and feels nothing short of drab and dated. So long old friend, the time has come to move on to the budget software bin, your time in the sun has sadly passed."
2,"Cool Planes, Bad Graphics and Handling","Yeah the planes might be cool, but all the other graphics stink. It looks like you're high above the city, when you're really 2 inches from crashing into it! Another thing is when you're in the air and you slightly tap a turn key, the plane starts going all over the place. And when the planes crash some of them don't even break!! Bad game Don't get it."
5,Raeall handy for walks in the woods!,"Instead of my one dog drinking questionable lake water I carry a water bottle and this and she is more inclined to go for this instead (I guess the lake water tastes as bad as it looks). I carry water anyway so to add this, which folds flat and small is easy to do and I feel better that she is drinking safe water. A must-have for any dog owner who travels with their pet."
5,"""HELP ME"" I'M CRAZY 'BOUT SONNY BOY !!!!!","This cd has got it all, the big hits and, also, hard-to-find ""classics!"" I'd been searching for a compilation of this caliber for a long time! Cuts like ""Little Village,"" with its hilarious out-take intro banter, ""Like Wolf,"" where Sonny Boy does his Howlin' Wolf impression, ""Santa Claus,"" which is about as funny as any blues song ever written, to ""Too Young To Die,"" about the consequences of his relationship with a 'green-eyed' young woman! 45 GREAT cuts, with Sonny Boy's dynamite HARP, VOCALS and STORYTELLING! What a TREAT!!! This is a MUST HAVE collection, the BEST available in my opinion! You'll want more, of course, but this is an unbelieveably comprehensive place to start!!! 'Nuf said!"
5,"Brockway is back, baby!","I feel like I've been waiting for this book forever but boy was it worth it! Kit was a hero to die for. Not only was he extremely sexy, but he also seemed like a real person with more than one side to his personality. And I wanted to be Kate! She was brave and feisty and a perfect match for Kit. I loved this book because it had romance, adventure, and even a little twist of suspense. I'm so excited because it seems to be the beginning of a trilogy. I'll be biting my fingernails until the next installment comes out!!! Welcome back, Ms. Brockway! The romance world needs you!"
2,Not what I expected....,"First, I want to say that I have seen the Cars in concert two times at the old Capitol Center in Maryland in the early 80's. I am a huge fan, but this DVD and CD is not what I expected. I am still enjoying the music none the less. The music on the CD is muddy at best. Like many of the other reviews, it just doesn't meet expectations. After listening to the CD and DVD, I would advise others to passing on this set. Sorry that the quality wasn't better!"
3,"Too small, but made well","""I received the pattern blocks from your company. The quality is great but I wish your pictures gave a better idea of the size. I was a bit disappointed that I spent $130 and they are smaller then I would have liked and expected. Amazon doesn't have size listed for the product."""
3,Web What?,"They say that you can use the Camera as a Web Cam but that is not so. After you follow the instructions to hook it up as a Web Cam they tell you that you have to buy additional software, but they don't tell you what software or where to get it. So the description for this product is misleading and false because if you buy it you really won't be able to use it as a web cam seeing how you have to buy even more software to make it into a web cam and that is only if you can find it."
3,Great camera but good luck getting it to work,"stetched to buy digital- and the still photo feature pushed me over the top. The salesman included ""firewire"" hardware from Pyro which includes Ulead editing software and, it works. The problem is that the while the camera takes great video and great photos, the Sony software included with the camera, needed to get the photo off the media stick and into a format the computer can read is defective. Doesn't work. Sony COULD or WOULD NOT HELP although they had a live rep available on a holiday, Gave me the line that it was the computer's fault- of course, the computer company said that since the camera was not purchased from them they could not provide support. HOURS, if not days on the phone and with badly written manuals. Result? No jpegs, just pretty pictures viewable through a 2.5"" viewer attached to the camera. An ($) mess."
1,Terrible awful To bad to review at all,"The camera was a piece of junk. It stopped working right after I got it. It wouldn't even record because it tore up the tape immediatly with an annoying dinging sound. It ruined tape, cost me money, but did nothing. I would not buy from this outfit."
1,Disappointing experience,"I bought it to take it with me to my trip to Europe. After using it for the third time the tape got stuck in there and never came out. I took it to the service center and they took 2 weeks to ""fix"" it. Now the tape ejects but the picture is ""pixelated"". They fixed 1 problem and created another. I have another trip to Asia in 1 1/2 weeks so the repair won't be on time. I never got to see the video's from Europe. I've decided to buy another one from JVC or Sony."
4,Great video; not so great stills.,"I'm quite pleased with the audio and video quality of this camcorder, as well as the plethora of features and effects (though most I'll probably never use). I like the steadyshot, nightshot, and being able to shoot in widescreen format -- those are my favorite features. What I'm terribly disappointed in with this camera is the quality of the still images; I get better quality from a disposable. In short, stills look absolutely terrible. I have fooled with taking stills under a variety of conditions, and they only look ""decent"" under the most optimal lighting circumstances. I can't complain too much since this is a secondary feature of the camcorder, and the video and audio really are remarkable, but I wish I had known that I'd also have to buy a digital still camera when shopping for this one."
4,"Great honey, but lavender taste is very subtle.","This is wonderful honey, but I was disappointed that it barely tasted or smelled of lavender. I have never tried lavender honey before, so perhaps it is always this way. I expected something stronger."
5,Superrock de FOBIA,"a great compalation of what mexican rock should be. If you want to taste Mexico city's scene, take a sample of FOBIA."
2,"Good idea, rather weak execution","Using humor to appeal to guys not controlling their diabetes, is a good idea. These guys might dismiss regular information campaigns. Basing the story on a real person is an effective approach. Rather than telling Steven Furst's story in a traditional manner, this movie uses a series of movie spoofs to drive the point home to our main character.Does this appeal to those who liked ""Animal House"", a movie I haven't seen? I find about half of American comedy to be un-funny, including, sadly, D-4-G. Most of the jokes fall flat, and can't lift this movie from its low production value.The introduction, the Forrest Gump scenes, the stunts, and the outtakes are amusing, but the rest of this movie makes me cringe. How could this ever turn an out-of control diabetic around? I wouldn't show this to anybody.Disclosure: I'm a Babylon 5 fan. My father is an in-control diabetic."
5,I'd send a copy to President Bush if I thought he'd actually read it,"The author, relating vignettes from his long tour of duty in Iraq, offers no pretense that he speaks for anyone but himself. I'll leave it to the other reviews to describe the tales told by the book. Anyone though who wants to know the results of fighting a war (or as some might have it, keeping the peace) on the cheap, while most Americans, just as during Viet Nam, do not have to sacrifice, should read Crawford's book. I commend this book to anyone responsible for any aspect of our Iraq policy- i.e., any American old enough to vote."
5,The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell,"Crawford really takes the reader into his world in Iraq: the blinding duststorms, the cleaning of latrines, the sporadic attempts at human contact with the Iraqi's, and the fatigue and boredom punctuated with moments of terror. His style is simple and direct. Unlike those who joined the service to fight in Iraq, Crawford was a National Guardsman and a reluctant warrior. His book reminds me of my experiences in Vietnam that I wrote about in my book, Hitchhiking from Vietnam: Seeking the OxHitchhiking From Vietnam. The ending of Crawford's story makes me want to say, ""John, get your life together and write another book."""
4,Very worthwhile,"This was a very well-written collection of stories describing life in Iraq as a soldier. The author does a great job of portraying the feeling of being in Iraq and just wanting to go home. He did not over-glorify being a soldier or list exciting war stories filled with adrenalin, instead he just laid out the facts, good and bad, about each event. There's no particular chronology to the book, just sort of an assortment of stories, each with it's own lesson. When I was done reading I came away with a better sense of the misery that is war, and an even greater appreciation and empathy for the military."
3,Decent read,"This book isn't written all that well, but he's not a professional writer so that can be forgiven. Everything just comes off a little flat overall, still a decent read though. Another thing is that each chapter is a whole new story, which I normally like, especially with war stories, but I think this book would have been better if Crawford would've just written it as his entire experience in Iraq. Also, he talks about his wife in many of the stories, so you kind of expect some kind of information or resolution regarding their relationship...and then all you get is one tiny remark at the end of the book.(I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it) I didn't like the ending at all.I usually only find good things to say about stuff I review, so that should tell you something about this book. I'm sure there are better written accounts of what has happened over there. My advice: read those."
2,Rushed to Print,"I can't say that this book was a good read. While I think John Crawford has an important story to tell--especially about the National Guard at war--his writing feels a little rushed. Perhaps a little more time to polish would have made a difference. I didn't find myself emotionally investing in Crawford or any of his fellow soldiers.Comparing this book to Michael Herr's Dispatches is really pushing it. Dispatches gave us a language to describe time, while this book doesn't reveal much more than the surface.I would suggest Colby Buzzell's ""My War"" as alternative. Not only is it entertaining, but it also puts a definitive on the war."
1,A whining pathetic waste of time. A disgrace.,"The book is full of falsehoods. Most units that Crawford complains about not staying as long as he did, have served just as long or longer. Many of them have already completed a second year long tour. None of them whined like he did. He complains about everyone in his chain of command as being poor leaders. But why after 7 years of total service, Crawford wasn't serving even as a squad leader? He was a volunteer twice both to active duty in the 101st and then to the National Guard. He would have to be an idiot not to think he would be called to active duty. He was not an accidental soldier, he served because he made a choice to enlist.There are far better soldiers out there, with far better stories about their experience in Iraq. Crawfords story is aself serving dribble.By the way the 101st is now serving its third tour."
4,Nearly Perfect,"Why not 5 stars ? This book could have benefited from a good editor. I am nit picking, but we often get parts of one tale in the next , almost verbatim. It's hard to form a consistent view of the characters and overall it lacks a framewok....BUT this is one guys raw view from the ground and as such none of my preamble matters. This is a great read, gripping, frightening and shocking. Buy it for all those we think we should bring our troops home, and buy it for those who think we should be there. Let this guy give you a view you won't get from the Pentagon, BBC, Fox or NPR. Oh, and when you have read it pass it on to someone else, it's the kind of book that deserves a wide readership."
1,Accidental Fabrication,"I haven't read Mr. Crawford/s book but I have read all 126 reviews. Based on the reviews, not one soldier that served in Iraq gave the book a positive review. That says those that know what serving in Iraq is like find the author something of a fraud.It was pointed out that Mr. Crawford previously served in the regular active-duty army and therefore he should know what service in the National Guard is all about, including being recalled to active duty in a time of war. You cannot over look this point. Therefore, the rest of Mr. Crawford/s claims must be suspect if he misrepresents being an accidental soldier.Drugs. You don't do drugs in a combat zone. I served in Vietnam and know that drugs and war do not mix very well.I suspect that the people who praise this book have an anti-Iraq war bias."
3,Karz to Chuka Diya!,This is one of govndas earliest movies made in 1991. the character back ups by juhi chawla and gulshan grover were excellent as well. it is a good bollywood movie even though the action aspect needed a little work.
3,Stones fairly useful,"In 110 experiments with magic conducted by various methods, I had a 23% success rate. In 22 experiments with the wishing stones, the success rate was 27%, slightly better."
4,This boz set contains the uncut British version of Dinsosaurs,"Potential buyers should be aware that this Hammer double-bill set contains the uncut version of When Dinsosaurs Ruled the Earth and not the G rated US theatrical release. Most importantly, it restores Veronica Vetri's brief nude scenes as well as nudity in an earlier scene in which a caveman rips the bra off his mate."
2,"good sound, songs shorter","This is a good album, great selections, great sound, the only dissapointment is that several songs are cut, not the original lenght versions."
2,An unexpected disappointment,"I really wanted to recommend this book -- a rare account of engineering efforts undertook to create Apple Newton - but I cannot do it with clear conscience. On the surface, ""Defying gravity"" should easily repeat the success of many stories of the birth of the Macintosh. But there's something wrong about this book, something that -- excuse the bad pun -- defies description. Maybe it is the strange format? Or plain ugly visual design? Maybe it's the peculiar page numbering scheme? Perhaps the stories are less captivating, and the photos too artistic? Might be all of that. However, the most important complaint is that, save for two little photos, there's absolutely no information about Newton's unique GUI. The book glosses over the countless difficult decisions that must have been faced during its inception, instead focusing on yet another Newton stage presentation during yet another computer trade show. Pity."
2,Totally useless Index! Pain in behind.,"Totally useless four page Index. Poor organization. Making it virtually impossible to navigate. Impossible to look up anything in this book. You'd have to read it cover to cover and hope that what you're most interested in pops up. After reading the reviews here I was disappointment to say the least.Nothing, that I could find, on progesterone/re: growth of uterine fibroids, endometriosis, muscle loss/age, testosterone/insulin resistance....and on.Needed more on ""Myths and Misunderstandings about Side Effects"""
2,Nice chair till the leg tore off of it,"While one must be patient with any purchase they make with today's furniture, especially office furniture, this chair appeared very nice when first bought and used. Then one of the five legs literally sheered off at the base. I am not a particularly heavy person, but this is ridiculous at best. What if someone was hurt due to poor workmanship or poor design?Oh, and if you buy from Chair Barn, there is option four for Amazon.com customers, which no one answers. Cross your fingers on getting a call back. Better chance to submit a claim in court than to get a live person."
4,A good story.,"My favorite history writer is Barbara Tuchman and I found some similarities between her and Mr. Crow in how they present history. They both bring a lot of the human element to history telling. I particularly enjoyed learning about Brasil's Dom Pedro II, who seems to get generally brushed over in history. One also gets a good feel for how and why the Latin American economic and political structures developed. It is extremely long, which is great for the amateur history buff, but probably not so great for the college student.He does have some obvious biases and makes a liberal amount of commentaries. His subjectivity is easy to recognize, enjoyable to read, and he often makes some good points. I appreciate that he doesn't hold back on both praise and criticism of significant people or events. I have a much broader understanding of our southern neighbors and plan to read the book again."
2,Downloaded for my son.,"Downloaded for my son, but he didn't stay interested long, but I think it is BC it was on my phone and not an actual book."
3,"Good in some topics, missing others","Good basic book for A/C structures, but its missing some very important topics such as torsion. Many better books that cover many more topics, such as A/C Structures by Perry (1950).Whats very nice is the diagrams of the problems. Unlike many books they are not overly simplified and may give confidence in tackling real structures.Could be a good beginners book for A/C structures"
2,not recomended,"This book shows only a couple of processes, very specific and very old, it not a good book at all for process analysis."
3,Clip Hanger,"Ordered colors - smoke deliveredWas not aware that this was not a retail-packaged product - had intended it as a gift, doesn't look like much in a tiny baggie with miniature instruction sheet."
5,true love,I think that this story is nice because is about two adolescents that get in love. But their love can't last forever because they are different. They are different because Winnie doesn't have everlasting and Jesse does. I think that this author had a lot of imagination to create this fantasy story. I think Winnie did the right thing by not drinking the water from the tree because if she did she would never die. And everybody is gonna die one day. Poor Jesse because he loved her so much and he would miss her a lot.
2,"Good collection, bad remaster","I love ZZ Top. When I saw the list of songs on this collection I decided to give it a shot. There are a bunch of great songs on here and if you're looking for good value, this might be it.I gave this album 2 stars because some of the classics have been remastered and I believe re-sung. Jesus Just Left Chicago and Beer Drinkers sound completely different from the originals on Tres Hombres. It sounds like Billy resang the vocals and the rest of the tracks were overproduced - they don't sound as gritty - a quality I love in the originals.Also, Legs is not the original. It's remixed with an electronic track up front that overtakes the guitar.In a word, if you're looking for the original songs, this is NOT the album to get."
4,great collection for $5... 3 stars if paying much more.,"grab it on sale and you have a superb collection of zz top hits, a few misses, and even a couple of songs that i don't think i've ever heard. but often, i find the music too similar... the hits just merge together and the misses, well i could just delete those and not look back (but it's personal preference). notables include the raw sounds in brown sugar, the long-forgotten jesus just left chicago and driving while blind, the seemingly out of place, but not, mexican blackbird, and all the rest you know by heart. diehard fans might love it, but glad i didn't pay too much to add to my collection..."
4,"This is ""ZZ's Top's"".","Well if the ""Best Of"" and ""Greatest Hits"" weren't enough for you, here's the 2-disc ""Very Best Of"". 38 tracks including most everything you could want from these three Texans. Sure there's a few missing still, but this does include ""La Grange"", ""Tush"", ""Gimme All Your Lovin'"", and ""Legs"". As far as I can tell, all the big hits are present, making the casual fan happy, if not the fanatic. Actually I think this is a bit much for alot of people, and some others probably have most of this anyway. So, I guess you just have to decide what you want, the hits, or the best? Of course I'd take either one over a ""Pearl Necklace""."
3,Redundant,"I love ZZ Top, but I have to wonder what's going on here. They just released a far more exhaustive box set, ""Chrome, Smoke, and BBQ,"" so why would they release what is basically a condensed version of the same set? Are they going after the casual fan who maybe doesn't want to shell out $45 for the box set to get ""Legs"" and ""Viva Las Vegas"" on the same album? Sure seems like it. Boys, you've been sold out by the record company marketing types."
2,Not Tummy Tots.,"I must say this did not have my one Granddaughter's attention like the Tummy Tots on the last Two CD's that were out, she loved the last two so much I order the new one of Zoey's Wild Things disappointed."
2,Don't bother unless you're desperate..,"Keene's 'The Rising' was an okay read. 'City of the Dead' is so not. You can't expect much from a writer of throwaway pulp fiction, but you do expect a little more than this. Two-dimensional characters (the ones that are even remotely interesting he kills off quickly), numerous pedantic gross-outs that are totally unnecessary, and sequences that just flat out defy physics in their stupidity...like the Humvee catching up to a faster car, or the driver of the humvee opening a window and using a lighter to make a hairspray flamethrower (LOL) at 80+mph or whatever. Must have been some lighter to withstand that sort of wind pressure. Give me a break. Keene is an okay writer, but this book was pretty atrocious. The bio at the back about publishers bugging him for sequels to The Rising kind of says it all, really."
1,Not worth reading,"The rising was a fantastic book, lets face it zombies are nearing their saturation point and are everywhere these days but Keene injected some life into this dying genre with talking zombies.The only way to excuse how bad City of the Dead would be to find out that a super fan of the rising kidnapped him and forced him to write this at gunpoint.The story is really bad, the new characters are not even to a cardboard cutout level and everything happens at such a pace that there is no build up whatsoever so when it reaches the action packed climax its very dull.The biggest screw you to the fans is the ending, look saying spoiled this crappy book is like saying I spit in your spoiled milk and now you can't drink it so I will say everyone dies and they die pointlessly.Still there were some really cool ideas but just a crappy mess of a book."
2,Not Zombies,"At first I thought this was going to be a great book. I love zombies. No one loves zombies more than me.If you love zombies, you will hate this. Zombies are classic and no one should change a classic or you get horrible results like the Resident Evil Movie (Paul Anderson)...This book is really about aliens.I was very excited and very pleased with this book until I got to the part where the ""zombies"" started speaking and using mental telepathy to communicate. And then they started driving trucks and cars and forming unions and then the novel came crashing down.It's not really about zombies. It's about aliens. It was misleading and for an alien book it wasn't too bad. But for a zombie book, it was terrible."
3,"Not As Good As ""The Rising"" But Still Fun","Brian Keene's follow up to his terrifying zombie novel ""The Rising"", is good, but not nearly as good as the original. The biggest problem with ""City of the Dead"" is that by continuing the story of his original protagonists, Keene negated the horrifying ending of the original. One wishes that when writing this book he had merely set it in the same world, but with different characters. That said, this book does succeed on many levels. A corporate CEO with delusions of grandeur fortifies his skyscraper against the zombie hordes even as the leader of the demons gathers his forces for the final assault upon humanity. The book is every bit as dark as its predecessor and offers its share of chills and kills. If you liked the first one you should dig this one as well."
3,Abandon hope all ye who enter here,"Absent from City of the Dead is a common facet of zombie horror: a sense of hope, of the human spirit surviving both its own flaws and the undead plague. Although the lack of this succeeds in setting a grim tone and leads to what, in my opinion, is a bold ending, it also bogs the novel down at times.I don't fault Keene for doing something different with a genre primarily defined by Romero's mythos. I'm all for something different when it comes to zombie fiction but this pervasive, almost misanthropic bent that City has - combined with an insurmountable, albeit unique, zombie enemy - adds up to a perfectly hopeless apocalypse.If you're a zombie fan, and you can get down with the idea of talking, driving, shooting undead, then it's certainly worth a read. But it can be a bummer when you know early on how (badly) things are going to turn out for the characters."
5,Good sequel,"The Rising was one of Brian Keene's best books. City of the dead was a good sequel to it. I don't think it had a ""silly plot,"" it continued from the end of the Rising and took off from there. Brian Keene is a good writer and if you want a good, suspensful, zombie read pick up The Rising and City of the Dead!"
2,Blah Zombie novel.,"Just another zombie novel. Doesn't stand out above the others. I thought the beginning was really good. It grabs you, but overall the book is predictable and sometimes boring. Its certainly not as good as Blood Crazy by Simon Clark. If you want a great zombie book pick that one up instead."
3,Not as good as the original,His first installment into the Zombie genre was as original as the 28 days later series. Although very intertaining this one falls short at being creative and original. With exception to the ending the rest of the book read like a lot of other zombie novels or movies.
4,City of the Dead continues The Rising,"""City of the Dead"" is very well written like ""The Rising"" City of the Dead is very bloody and creepy wit ha twist of Sci Fi mixed in with the Zombies. This book basicaly ties up loose ends that were left in the end of the book The Rising. Highly Recomended if you liked ""The Rising"""
1,Don't throw out your tape yet!!!,"Like just about everybody else who wrote a review, I have been waiting eagerly for decades for this to be released on CD. I'm glad that they finally did release it, but I have mixed feelings about the release. The additions to the first half from 1977-1979 are definitely an improvement over the LP or tape. The second CD of 1980-1981 adds some mediocre versions of songs in an attempt to reproduce the concert playlist. However, the CD was so long at this point (>77 minutes) that they axed the slow beginning of ""Crosseyed and Painless"". If you want to continue to listen to this song as it was originally played, you'd better not throw out your tape!"
5,a piece of America -,"I disagree with those who say these have poor sound quality. Older records don't need to be cleaned-up to fit the perfect digital world of today. I was interested in some of the softer, jazzier pieces - the kind of thing that Chuck Berry doesn't get credit for: Havana Moon, Around and Around, Merry Christmas Baby, My Dream. These discs show that he was not just a 'rock genius' - but a well-rounded composer and musician."
5,"This is GREAT, completes my ""Paul"" collection","As in the title, this is a GREAT DVD of Paul' newest (well...since 2000, anyway) incarnation. And, along with a very VERY bootlegged DVD of his ""Venus & Mars"" incarnation/tour, I now have my Sir Paul collection complete. Great band, especially Abe Jr & Wix, and I was particularly grateful to see & hear Paul FINALLY do MY fave of his solo ""hits,"" ""Too Many People."" But I could have lived forever without having to see/hear Cameron Crowe, ""Bono,"" & Slick Willy Clinton in this, but - well, you get John L, you have to deal w/ Yoko, you get George, you have to deal with purple pagan dieties (or worse), or Ringo - said it before and I'll say it again, the '98 tour w/ Gary Brooker & the '01 tour w/ Ian Hunter are really all you need. Digging much further than THAT, you get Mark Farner or Sheila E, but ""buy the ticket, take the ride,"" I guess... ""Space Within Us"" is great!"
2,"Great concert LIVE, great singer, great band, great songs...","... but the A&E preview was enough to make me steer clear... I agree with all the other low-star reviews: pretentious, painful weeping soccer moms, two second cuts, few shots of band (never sustained), ugh... I could go on... It was a great show to see, but I guess we'll have to wait a couple decades before someone with taste and good judgement can re-edit these shows ~ Paul is obviously clueless and yes, his insecurities are bottomless..."
4,hold up everyone,"I just saw the preview of this on A&E; and they did have a full version of Please Please Me performed and according to this review I found, I'll Follow the Sun is also in it. See below. His voice sounds great on most the songs that I saw (a little weak on Jenny Wren). Anyway here's the review.http://dvdmg.com/mccartneyspacewithinus.shtml"
3,Too much audience,I've seen Paul McCarntey 3 times in concert 1977 and 2x in 1989. That's when he was at the top of his game.He still sounds pretty good. His voice is no where near what it used to be.I've seen all of his concert videos. The best one I've seen was a TV speacial from the Ed Sullivan theatre.Pure music with no audience distraction.I can't find this on DVD. There is way too much audience footage in this latest video.The best part was the sound checks where there was no audience. I think it's pretty muchunderstood how important the Beatles were and what a tremendous songerwriter Paul is.I don't need to see little kids and old men crying while lip syching to his songs to confirm this.I'm surprised Paul allows this to happen. I don't think Lennon or Harrison would carry on like this.Why can' I just watch a solid concert performance. The director should have his head examined.
2,Another Blu-Ray dissapointment,"Good video, sad audio. Instead of recording the audio with surround in mind, it sounds like they tried to re-mix the 2-channel into make believe 5.1. It didn't work."
3,More of the same,"I bought this in order to have it as part of my lifelong collection of all things McCartney. However, I think that this is one DVD that should have stayed in. It is starting to get boring with the same songs, almost the same situations and reactions. I must admit there are killer versions of songs he never included, and some candid moments that make it all worthwhile. If Paul ever reads this... I love you Paul, but let the next one simmer for longer, OK?"
1,Save Your $,"I just watched this DVD for the 1st and last time. I don't know which I dislike more: the abbreviated play list, the constant cuts to audience faces, or the split second editing cut as if it were done on a roulette wheel. If you have never owned a McCartney DVD try 'Back in the US' or 'In Red Square'. I've watched both several times, and will watch them again.I was at the show at the Pond in Anaheim, GREAT SHOW! My family loved the new pyro in 'Live and Let Die'. It was awsome. Our favorite songs were 'Band on the Run' and 'Hey Jude'. Couldn't wait to see it all on the DVD. Between each song (and there were 35 that night!) Paul would give some insite into how he wrote the next song...or some little thing that made you feel lucky to be there. None of this is on this DVD.Save your $"
2,Editor with ADHD,"This is a useful movie to show to budding film (especially documentary) editors about how overzealous editing can destroy good footage. The viewer is never given more than a few seconds before it cuts away to another angle, or worse, another audience shot.A particularly egregious example of sophomoric editing is seen during Eleanor Rigby, when the stage is superimposed on endless faces from the audience, presumably ""all the lonely people"".Every song is followed by interviews with people (some famous, like Bill Clinton, Steve Jobs, and others less so) who endlessly mouth platitudes about how great Paul McCartney is.I fervently hope that at some point in the future someone will use the high-def concert footage with excellent sound quality to put together another more watchable disc."
3,TOO MANY FAN SHOTS,"Poorly made video of a great concert. I saw him live and wanted this as a rememberance, but was very disappointed in how many interruptions there were with shots of the fans and interviews with celebrities. Those moments should have been put on a separte disc."
5,Yeah,"This just made my day, as I approach the one year anniversary of having been at the St. Paul show (Oct.26) I can't wait to tell my neighbor who got me into Paul! Good Lovin' Tonight, indeed!"
4,Amazing,The recording is an example of early electronics pioneering and implements an instrument invented in the 40's by Professor Trautwein of Cologne university in Germany. Oscar Sala Made many improvements on the instrument and also performed many improvisations with it in order to express the various different timbres that the instrument is capable of. This C.D. should appeal to those interested in the developement of electronic music and also fans of Stravinsky.
1,Badly designed,"We got this Wiz Kid and also the Kids A-Bod. We had to return this one and exchange it for a second Kids A-Bod harness. This wiz kid did not fit our son correctly at all. The design is just badly done. You have to be just the right size for the center closure to fit correctly. There is no adjustment for this piece at all.The much better harness is made by the same company, Black Diamond. It is fully adjustable and fits a larger range of sizes.Black Diamond Kids' A-Bod Harness Black, One Size"
4,cumulative rhyme,"This is a simple picture book written as a cumulative rhyme. It's about a little boy and girl who stay with their nanny while their mom and day are away. The little boy and girl make a big mess in the house while the nanny is busy doing other chores. When the dad comes home they all try to clean the house before the mom gets back. When the mom arrives the house is clean again and she never suspects a thing!The cumulative rhyme would make it a great read aloud to young children. By the end of the book they will be ""reading"" the book along with the storyteller.Young children will be able to relate to the boy and the girl in the story well."
4,Works great--if you remember this!,"This is a solid, very reasonably-priced KVM. I've used mine for a year now and have had no trouble with it---EXCEPT for one particular quirk, which I suspect is common to KVMs:When you switch from one computer to the other, you must be sure NOT to move your mouse, or press any keyboard keys, until the KVM's light stops flashing, indicating a successful connection.If you forget and move your mouse or press a key BEFORE the light stops flashing, your mouse and/or keyboard may stop responding.If you inadvertently do this---or if the switch doesn't make the new connection for some other reason---you can usually fix it by removing the switch's USB connectors from both computers, waiting for 10 or 15 seconds, then reconnecting them.(I suspect that most of the bad reviews here are from people who didn't realize these things.)"
1,not so good,Stopped working after 3 months - that can't be good. Seems like others have had the same problem.
1,Three weeks and Died,"Worked for three weeks then died. No real warranty protection (pack it up, spend $18.00 to ship it back to them and then wait 3-5 weeks). I picked up a new IO gear switch for a lower price and found it to be a more reliable and faster switch to boot. Considering the warranty problems I am crossing Trendnet of my list of suppliers."
2,Regrets,"Maybe I don't understand something, but I followed every step of the user manual, and the product still refuses to do what it claims to do--switch betwen two computers. One is an older Vista desktop and the other is a recent Windows 7 Portable. I wish I knew what the problem is."
5,Works with Logitech wireless - quite happy,"This thing just works. No issues in our Windows environment, if you want to use a cheap Logitech wireless keyboard / mouse combo off the front (we use the MK320 cordless desktop set) it could not be more simple. Quite pleased with this cheap KVM; anyone who remembers the bad old days of flaky, low-res PS/2 KVM switches should be happy with this. Have not tried it in a virtual environment yet, and I feel sorry for anyone trying to use a KVM in a mixed Linux / Windows environment. Given that this is so far headache free and comes with all the cables you need, I would gladly order more for the asking price of forty bucks."
2,This product will not work consistently,I purchased this product in Jan 2011 and I will tell you this product has failed me. I have 3 all Windows 7 machines connected and this will fail to pick 2 computers randomly. The first computer that is switched on it will recognize - but it fails me every time on computer 2 and sometimes on computer 3. Port 4 is empty nothing connected. Each time I have go under my computer desk and muck with the thing to get it going. Very frustrating. I ordered the IOGear 4-port USB KVM Switch and plan to use that.I've had good luck with TRENDnet products in the past - but this one I can't say the same. But if you want to risk it like I did for the price listed - go ahead.
2,Problems with a PC and a MAC,"my configuration is: a MAC powerbook and an Acer laptop. Problems:- in MAC the double SCROLL LOCK doesn't work so I have to switch by pressing the buttons- in MAC, a wireless mouse won't be recognized so I have to use a corded one- once I switch to MAC and back to PC, the only way for the PC to recognize the mouse/keyboard...is to REBOOTgoing back to 2 monitors/keyboards/mice....not worth the money for my particular case."
2,Works... as long as you don't turn off computer,"I bought this product to share a monitor between two computers. It worked perfectly as long as I left both computers on all the time. If I turned off a computer and then turned it back on, I had to unplug the USB cables and then reinsert them into the computer to get the device to recognize the computer that had been off. Needless to say, I unhooked the device and no longer use it."
2,Great Switch For the Price,"This switch works really well. I use it between a Windows XP and Windows 98 operating systems. When switching to Windows 98, control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly. However, when switching to the XP OS, control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds. I also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one USB port on the PC. It frees up a port. Using the Numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch. It also has buttons on the device itself to select which PC to control.I rate this product 5 stars. When I posted the first time, I thought I put 5 stars; but I must have accidentally selected 2. I recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price."
5,Works Great,"I went from a ps2 keyboard to a USB keyboard on my PCs and therefore I had to change my KVM switch. I had used Trendnet in the past, so I bought this USB KVM switch and it works perfectly. I thought i would need a converter to go from PS2 to USB, but i didnt."
3,Just OK,The TRENDnet 4-Port USB KVM Swith works just not as well as I would like. My major complaint is the lag when moving between CPUs. There is a significiant period of time before the mouse and keyboard are active following the switch. This is most notable if playing an MMO. The MMO simply locks up and you have to reboot.The installation is well documented and easy. Having the cables included is also a real plus.
2,Nature vs Man...I wish!,"This is a bad film. There are many fine actors in it, people who have made mediocre films quite memorable. But they cannot salvage this turkey. The plot is obvious, the sets cheap and flimsy, the language never convincing, and the dreadful, tedious, and completely uninteresting Carmen Chaplin makes a overwhelmingly telegraphed romance not only unbelievable but implausible.Nice costumes, but this is a lame film, never really addressing its ""theme"" and containing all sorts of mysterious and silly developments that are never utilized. Maybe it would have been good if they left all the missing stuff in, but for a boring movie it sure felt rushed. About the worst thing one could say about it....both way too long and not nearly long enough.Justifiably unknown."
3,Viewed as a snapshot in time: 4 stars; else: 2 stars,"This film is an interesting study of the forces of human nature, as well as humans' desire and (vain) effort to force their will onto nature itself.It's plot, however, keeps pace with nature - most of the time developing at a glacial pace - with only brief moments of faster development.Similar to a tree, without leaves after the winter, the movie starts out in a worn down environment, holding promises of an interesting future to come. Like twigs growing buds, the initial characters are setup and are slowly developing, reminiscent of growing leaves. A brief blossom displays a certain type of beauty, only to be eradicated by the forces of nature.Eventually echoes of autumn settle in, with some of the protagonists falling like autumn leaves. Yet, on the other hand, new shades and colors reveal themselves in and for the remaining protagonists during this time of re-evaluation of their values; ultimately leading to a much more harmonious existence."
4,Relating to People of Other Religions: What every Christian needs to know,"This book was assigned for a class in compassion. We are using the information to gain a better understanding of other religions, especially Hindu and Muslim. I find it an easy read with good basis for this understanding. But if you want a deeper knowlegde, I recommend getting books that go into each religion separately in depth, such as books by Karen Armstrong, etc."
1,Ghostly drums: buyer beware!,"I bought this cd because more instruments were played in addition to the traditional drums of say, Shamanic Journey Drumming by Rysdyk. In the end though, I feel that Rysdyk's recording is the better choice.There are two things that I really don't like about this cd:The first is the metallic quality of the drum sound, which reminds one of a synthesizer. Rysdyk's drums have a deep, cavernous quality that is simply wonderful, specially if you listen to them with earphones on. Strange to say, the drums on this cd are strident. There is no space in the sound in which your spirit can move.The second problem is the constant background incantation.What I take to be some kind of prayer to the spirits sounds so eerie and ghostly that I couldn't listen to this cd for more than a few minutes. I was afraid of becoming possessed or attracting some unwelcome visitors from the lower planes.So think twice before buying this cd."
2,BAD QUALITY LAMPS. LENS CRACK WHEN RAINING,I GOT THESE LAMPS ALONG ALONG WITH THE FLOOD LAMPS. THE FOG LAMPS CRACKED WHILE DRIVING ON A RAINY NIGHT. BAD QUALITY LAMPS. RESTRAIN FROM BUYING THESE.
5,Moving and excellent insights,I used this DVD in my high school Middle Eastern Studies course. I found it to be an excellent insider look at the complexity of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. It's also a hopeful perspective. The students found it to be by far one of the best visuals I use.
1,Stick Light,"It works as shown on TV. It is too dim to do more than allow you to see enough to keep from tripping over something. If the top of the bulb was black, it would allow light to be directed much better. Overall it is okay."
1,Buy several flashlights and leave them where you need them!,"This looks like a good idea from Westinghouse, but if you read the warranty details, the krypton bulb is not covered under the 10-year warranty. $10.00 for a bulb that is warranted for 10 years - but not really? What is the point? Extra tape isn't even included when the first strip fails.I suggest you use a flashlight."
3,I have to be neutral,"I bought the book for my husband who just finished an intense few months absorbed in Dahn Hak Yoga. He was so excited to get it, but then I found it a few weeks later in our stack to give to charity. He didn't find what he needed in there... good luck."
1,A dog trainers opinion,The methods of Koehler are cruel and unusual. No one should use any of his techniques. His books are just an excuse for his sadism. This is not how you train a dog... this is how you abuse a dog.
3,old school,Before when there were no other protection training books many people read this book since there were no other. Now there are more better methods on training. It would be best if they removed the books off the shelves. Koehler needs to get into the the 21st century and republish this book.
4,Koehler is a little strange...,"I have had Koehler's guard dog training book for about 5 years and have used the obedience section to train 3 of my own personal dogs. I am not a dog trainer but I understand the importance Koehler puts into his training in obedience. There is NOTHING worse than an ill behaved dog... especially since I am a fan of the GSD!!! Koehler is strange and perhaps a bit too strict in some of his training but when push comes to shove... his training works!!! The only book I've read that is equilivent or better is ""Dog training for law enforcement"" by R.S. Eden!!!! As a police officer I plan to use Koehler's book to further train my personal dog for home protection."
1,yet another apocalyptic novel from mr.keene,"ok Brian Keene has some serious issues with the end of the world. I enjoyed The Rising,i really did. The City of the Dead not so much and now we have The Conqueror Worms. Fantastic (note sarcasm inserted here). The whole rain thing i can buy it rains alot in RI. It reminded me too much of the movie Squirm. And now these worm things.His protaganist is an old man that worries more about his lack of nicotine and falling and breaking an hip than his more than obvious plight. Dont get me wrong....it is pretty terrifying to imagine whole cities gone and pretty much nothing left. He dabbles into the why's of it barely and what we're left with is that it comes down to Satanists.ooooookaaay. Then he doesnt even leave you with a little teeny bright spot at the end .It just ends there thats that deal with it."
2,Is this Lancome?,"It doesn't fix that much, and what else do you want from a eyeliner?? If is it a Lancome, then, I'm surprised with the low quality..."
4,pros and cons,"Pros: Lots of info, cool pictures, almost compleatly unknown movies (like Death Line) and huge hits everybody knows about (like Halloween) together. Also, not just PG-13 and R rated movies, some are rated X (like Snuff) and NC-17 (like The Evil Dead)Cons: veary heavy and big-hard to carry around, out dated- only goes up to 1986, no table of contents.Warning: This book describes movies with killing in graphic detail. The pictures contain nudity and gore.Over all: Not bad, lots of info, very graphic an ok buy."
5,Hoyt Axton: One of the Last of the REAL COUNTRY/REAL FOLK singers,"This album, if you can find it, is a genuine gem. It shows the warmth and naive energy he brought to most of his work. This has a lot of the early stuff and is a must have if you're a Hoyt Axton fan. We all will miss him. You cannot be disappointed with this album....sure, it's not the best quality super-fidelity recording and there are a lot of his best songs not included, but the ones that are here will rock you and touch your heart."
2,2 Stars Just For Wasteland.,"Alright, why in the world would some of you idiots compare this band to the amazing TOOL? That is rediculous and now I am pissed. But to the business at hand here. This album is nothing special, except for Wasteland. That song is one of my favorite songs to hit the airwaves in recent years. Trust me though, all their focus and energy was on this one damn song. Every other song on here is so boring that you will need a nap after you listen to it. All of this has been done before, 10 Years is a fraud and I am ashamed that they are from my state of Tennessee. If you want a good band from Tennessee, check out COPPER, you 10 Years fans will be blown out of the water. Anyways, my advice to you rock lovers out there, download Wasteland and forget about this band because they won't be around for long."
2,2.5 stars actually,"This album isn't that bad. I just don't think this band has what it takes to stay around long. I've been wrong before, but I think it's the lack of 'excitement factor' here. The album sorta rocks OK, but it's not hitting me like say Seether's last album. Sure it's different music than Seether, but 10 Years actually sound like a handful of other groups I've heard recently, and unless they try more variety, they may be a one hit wonder band."
5,great new band!!!!!!!!!,"finally, a new band that is actually good. almost all the songs are great.......best songs are: wasteland..through the iris...the autumn affect."
5,One Of 2005's Best Records...Hands Down!!,"This album has a very TOOL sound, but it isn't by any means a copycat. It has it's shifts of melody and heaviness, but it's not nu-metal. It's just plain good. The singer does have a voice that is at times like Maynard James Keenan and at others almost like David Draiman. I would highly recommend this record to anyone who is a fan of the following bands, A Perfect Circle, Tool, Earshot or Staind. It has a really cool, very rocking sound. Best songs, ""Through The Iris"", ""Cast It Out"" and ""Wasteland""."
5,This CD is fantastic!,"10 YEARS is a pheonomenally talented band. I cannot believe they do not receive more airplay. The Autumn Effect is so well put together. I listen to the albumn in its entirety several times a week and never tire of it. I'm proud to say I bought this CD several months ago before the popularity of WASTELAND. If you enjoy hard (yet understandable lyrics) rock, this CD is a must. I am anxious for future releases from this band!"
4,Inside the Red Tent (Popular Insights),"After reading the novel, The Red Tent, I found this a good follow-up to see further into the times of this setting. As we are studying Genesis for our Bible Study this year, I am encouraging my ladies to read both the novel and this interesting look into the women of Abraham's family."
4,Very good read,I really enjoyed reading this book. I appreciated the author doing this from Dinah's view since as written in the Bible the story is somewhat different. If you are considering this book it does not disappoint.
4,Thrilling Biblical Fiction,"If you are secure enough in the biblical truths to realize what is real and what is fiction, then this is a really good book to read. It is loaded with the culture of the times as well as good old Drama! I thought it fun to give 'Dinah' a personality and a story (even though fictional) because her story is not told in the bible. Remember it's fiction and enjoy! For fun, search the bible to see the true lineage and the truth between this tale and the true account of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
1,Not worth the $$$,My hairstylist told me about this brush as she was always using it to style my hair. I have blonde hair and live in FL and my hair always seems frizzy to me. I ordered this online and it was going to take almost 2 weeks to get to me so I also went to a beauty supply store and bought one for $6! Today I use the one for $6 more than I use the Marilyn brush that cost me an arm and a leg! May work great for some... but wasn't worth it to me!
3,Hard to find a book on Van Bruen,"For fun I have been reading biographies starting with Washington. There are not a lot of books on Van Buren. This is the first one of the American Presidents Series I have tried. It is a quick read for a one term president. It did satisfiy my purposes but I was put off by the continual references and comparisons to modern presidents. By this, I mean it was difficult to lose myself in the Van Buren time period."
1,TOO EXPENSIVE,This lamp is 19.99 on Target.com and even less expensive in Ikea. Why is it being sold for so much that's not fair on consumers.
1,Unrealsitic Stupid Movie,"I bought this movie years ago and I deeply regret it. This movie is unrealistic, has no graphics just fake crap, and doesn't make sense. It is supposed to be about werewolves but turns out to be about kangaroos that kill people. Some parts are werewolves but others are kangaroos. Never bother watching. Never."
1,howling 3 is a hollowiong flop,"this movie is so bad my cats could have done better. it is so bad it doesn't even rate a'worst movie' of the century award. howling, the original, shou7ld sue just for infringement of its magical cottails!throwing yourmoney down the gutter would be more entertaining."
3,But what happened to Imogen Annesley?,"I first saw this on VHS long ago and - for no good reason - loved it. Perhaps it was because Imogen Annesley is so hot (...). Or the fact that the makers of this B movie KNEW they were making a B movie and even parodied it when the actors WENT to a grade B werewolf movie, IN the movie (got that?). Parts are so bad it's embarrassing, like a movie director called Speilbergman - when it's not supposed to be a joke. So it's laced with intentional and unintentional humor and famous Australian actors you'll recognize. But you'll watch it for Imogen, the eventual werewolf mother who DOESN'T die. Gad, you have to see the entire movie, reviewers!"
3,Fishy,well packaged (taste like shrimp with a hint of Booty Flavored particles ) I Recommend It to anyone with weird taste buds !
1,Yuk,We opened the bag at a party and the rotten shrimp smell was too much-had to throw them out. Wouldn't recommend this product.
4,Personally I think this tastes like ass,"It's...definitely shrimp flavored. But it doesn't taste like...good shrimp. I'm not sure what I expected. I just don't like it.Though if you really love shrimp, go for it!"
3,It was great a little bit high though,The chips were in good conditionThe bag of the chips was made of really durable plasticThe price of the chips were a little high..
3,A little early for a greatest hits package,"I guess you only have to have four records in todays music industry to warrant a greatest hits package. Well, the Backstreet Boys seem to think they have to release an album like this, but what they're really saying is they've either run out of ideas or that they're breaking up. If you're a casual BSB fan, this is a great album to get, but longtime fans don't need to waste their money on this."
5,Backstreet Boys Fans Must read if you want to her of a good,I love this Cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,These guys [are not good]...,The Backstreet Boys are nothing but a clone of NKOTB who are nothing but a clone of the greatest R&B group of the eighties New Edition. For all you sucka's who don't know if there had been no New Edition there would be no BSB. BSB owe their carrer to New Edition.
4,Why?,"I'm not gonna bash the boys with this review. I happen to like the music. But I've never been a fan of Greatest Hits collections...especially when they encompass only three other albums which I already have and enjoy. The only new addition is ""Drowning"".Do yourself a favor, grab the DVD of ""Chapter One"", not the CD...so you can at least get a little something more out of your money."
1,Non GreatestHits for the big fans!,"First of all, i can't buy this CD because i don't have a cridit card...So i'll tell u my opinion: i know & meomrize every damn song in this CD...BECAUSE its the greatest hits for God sake!! BUT any way, i'll try to buy it for my friend BECAUSE she is not a big fan like me, THIS CD is sutible for the non-fan of BSB& i'll buy another BSB CD's..."
1,OH MY GOD,"Whenever I hear the backstreet boys, I imagine (...)flying out of their mouths with every word they say. They are the most embarrasing group of girls to ever be labeled in the category of music. To think that music used to be Jimi Hendrix, Louis Armstrong, Pink Floyd, Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis- the trend here is people who actually made original melody and sounds. Just look at the cover of this cd. My God, please tell me you are embarrased for them. They look like lesbians with moustaches- nuff said."
5,This CD will make you a fan,"I was not a very big fan of rap at all until I heard this cd. The rhymes flow really well and, being from Montgomery also, I can relate to the stories unfolding within each song. This is not MTV pop-rap, this is hard, true rap with a definate edginess that wouldn't be lost on even the most discerning set of ears. If your stereo can handle low bass, I highly suggest testing your speakers with this cd. You might even turn some people on to the ""Dirty South"" rap that may not have otherwise heard before. Oh, one more thing...If you like to engage in a certain ""group activity"", this cd is a perfect soundtrack to a lazy Saturday afternoon or a Friday night rollin' through town with some friends. *wink*"
1,What a pain!,"Don't put yourself through the trouble. The item is overall defective and unreliable. I purchased 3 of these at once, not just 1, and they ALL have problems! The touch settings the lamp is supposed to have do not work properly at all. At first it would at least turn on and off when I touched them, but after the first half hour they refused to change at all, forcing me to have to plug it in and out to operate it-I bought them so I wouldn't HAVE to do that!They've eaten 6 bulbs (of correct watts) so far in a 2 day period. Such a waste!"
2,Touch Sensor Lamp,My touch sensor lamp shuts itself off a short while after being turned on - very frustrating.
5,Just buy it. You won't be disappointed,"It's a great compilation of a great band.In addition of their best music you will find special Edits and remixes not available anywhere else. If that's not all, the album seems to be out of print in most major markets. This is a great opportunity to have this CD as part of your collection before it's gone forever.Ya viene la fuerza! La Voz de los Ochenta!"
4,"no surprises, nice grill brush","I really like the two replacement brush heads included with this brush. For the price this is a nice product, and I hope it will last at least a couple of years. Nicely made, good rubber grip detail, solid wood construction, and overall very good quality."
3,Pretty good...,"This bandage is great because it's elastic, so when you wrap it around the affected limb, it holds tight.It also has truly strong Velcro at both ends - it simply does not let go. I have to reiterate: the Velcro on this bandage is the real deal - not the cheap stuff.The reason I rated this a 3 star is that after a few weeks of not-too-heavy usage (used about twice a week), the elastic is starting to go a little slack. It's not completely useless, but it's certainly not as strong as it was brand new. I kind of expected this, but would have appreciated a bandage where the elasticity lasted longer.In any case, this bandage has solved my need for now. In the long run, I will probably end up making my own bandage based on this design, but with a stronger elastic part to it. . ."
2,An article stretched to a book.,"Although the book had a few cute annocdotes, there were too few (despite repeated references) to stretch it to fill a book (even this short one)."
2,Heard it before,It's not that it wasn't entertaining. It's not that the subject matter wasn't right up my alley. It's the fact that I've heard practically every one of these stories before on a website or an email forward somewhere.I'm sure this would be a great read for the cynical and revenge minded people who aren't well web-read. Everyone else should likely steer clear.
5,Don't let this book escape your notice!,"Sex, Lies and Menopause is a critical book for any women interested in understanding the current uproar about HRT. T.S. Wiley has carefully documented the sordid history of HRT and more importantly offers a new hypothesis for understanding the epidemic of breast cancer. I have personally followed T.S. Wiley's suggestions for the past 2 years and can attest to the validity of her astute insights described in this book."
5,Fun exercise and great entertainment!,I bought a purple one and a blue one for my girls for Christmas.They are ages 11 and 7. They both enjoy riding on them and chasing each other. They even set up an obstacle course in which they can maneuver the flying turtles. They love them and what great exercise!
4,flying turtle,I purchased this item for my son and he absolutely loves it! Its actually an exercise tool but my son uses it as a toy.
5,flying turtle fun!,My kid loves it! and do all her friends!! it's a great little coaster! the handles come off but it doesn't bother the kids!
1,Rusty Signs! Not!!,"Why should we get excited with 2 guys running around the Country Buying Rusty Signs & other Uninteresting Articles for their Stores. This is not Antique RoadShow Quality AT ALL!! AT Least Show us how it would help us & Sell it so that we can see the Follow thru!!! there is no Follow Up with these Guys, We have 2 take their word on how much they Sold it for, THAT IS NOT EXCITING! then they go to Junk-Filled Stores & The People Don't Want 2 Sell! That Doesn't Make Sense!! Other Sellers have an Auto Grave Yard, 40 or 50 Rusty Cars that they Don't Want to Sell I Guess they have them to Just Look at for 30 years! That Does not Entertain Us!"
2,Clemencic misfires.,"Naxos deserves our gratitude for its wide and adventurous repertoire, and while I cannot be as keen as the previous reviewer about the quality of this music, I am glad to have had the chance to hear it. The big let down for me with this CD, however, is the performance, especially since I have always trusted the name Rene Clemencic as a guarantee of at least a certain level of quality. There must be a back story to explain how this fine conductor got tied to the present group of village musicians: the soloists are weak, the choir and instrumentalists uncertain. Furthermore, Clemencic's decision to double the choir parts with brass -- while it may be supported by arguments of authenticity, or it may rather have been a practical decision, given the choristers at hand -- produces a disagreeable and unbalanced texture. I would avoid this CD, unless there is a particular curiosity about this composer."
1,tartar remover,"This did nothing to get tarter off my dogs teeth, scraped & scraped. lousy tool. cheap, but did not work."
4,Useful tool,"These tartar removers are actually kind of hard to find, so it was nice to be able to get it on Amazon. The tool works great. The shipping seemed to take a long time, but other than that, all was good."
2,Not sharp enough!,"I'll have to agree with the other reviews that this ""scraper"" isn't sharp enough! Maybe your tarter is real thick then it might help but If you really need to scrape your teeth I would pass this one up. You really can't tell from the picture so it's best to believe the reviews, good price, but not worth it if it doesn't do the job!"
4,Good overview of UML -Java mapping,"This book has a good chapter 4 on UML-Java mapping which is explained very clearly. Other books tends to be bombastic and theorectical and vomitting out dry, useless high level UML jargons. Since most developers knows attrbutes and methods better than say, trying to figure out what an association link is, the mentioned chapter is invaluable. I wish the authors expanded more on UML-Java mapping as developer can then relate a diagram to the Java code. I would have given the book 5 star if it had expanded a bit on modelling XML and UML-Java mapping."
2,Very let down by this game,"Wow. After playing the C.O.D. series, this was like stepping back in technology to the days of ""pong"" as a video game. This game is clunky, awkward and just a pain in the butt to try to play. Everything is very slow and there's too much dialogue and not enough shoot-em-up. Weapons inaccurate. Unless you are receiving fire, that is. That is very accurate.Sorry, gamers, but this game is just no fun in sols 360. I'm going to quit, sell it as used and move on. Not worth finishing."
1,Horrible,The game play for this game is just terrible. I couldnt wait for the campaighn to be over. most slow paced game i ever played.
2,Under-developed disappointment,"I was greatly looking forward to this book, as I had heard and read so much about it. But I was ultimately disappointed. The language itself is beautiful and fluid, and the world it transports you to - San Francisco's Chinatown in the 19th century and the political and geographical climate in Chile - is fascinating. Her characters are interesting, but sorely under-developed and inconsistently characterized. In her plot, she alludes to the dangerous, beautiful, passionate and fantastical, but in the end only develops the conventional. There was so much potential in the culture and climate of this book and the language is so beautiful... it is such a shame she never focused and developed the story into what it could have been."
1,Big Disappointment =(,"Having read House of the Spirits and Daughter of Fortune, I eagerly awaited her new novel. This was a great disappointment. I wanted to read this sequel so badly that I even bought the Spanish version and read it a year ago. When I finished that book, I thought maybe it was my Spanish language skills that had detracted from the book. It wasn't.None of the characters were interesting enough to have a lasting effect. I couldn't sympathize with them by the end of the novel. It was also too similar to Daughter of Fortune in some ways. Overall, it was too predictable and boring.The only reason I read until the end was because I was unwilling to believe that this was it. I was sure there had to be something memorable by the end, but there wasn't. Don't waste your money on this book."
2,A Disappointment,"I've read almost all of Allende's work, considering her one of my favorite writers. Sadly, each book after ""Paula"" seems weaker than the last. I read that she was utterly devastated by the death of her beloved daughter, Paula, and had to go on anti depressants and that it was hard to write for quite some time because the medication made her feel muted. It may be, tragically, that the death of her only daughter created a permanent void for her, that she is unable to write with the same type of passion she was capable before. This would be understandable and yet a great loss for the world."
3,The audio book needs a reader who speaks Spanish,"...at least they should have a reader who can pronounce the names as they were intended...Blair keeps SUPER annoying me with her mispronounciation of the name Del Valle ---the accent falls on the first syllable..it is not on the ""ey"" it is on the ""val"" and Agustin....how could that happen? With all her talent, and with all the bilingual people out there, how could that get by? A GOOS TEEN not A GOOS TAN like it were French...pleaseee!!!!"

2,...,"This is like the arm-chair guide to the superficial, ontological contemplation of careers by reading a bunch of nice little sayings - NOT the ""practical"" tome of vocational guidance it poses to be!! Trust me, it would better serve as a page-a-day vocational calendar. I read this entire book a few times in search of something useful... It is as though the author had nothing original to actually say! I completed the few little lists and what-nots the books asks the reader to complete; but disappointingly, they were fruitless. This book was a total waste of my money and time..."
5,In A Class of its Own,"Until you listen to Last Five Years from start to finish, one cannot express just how unique and brilliant it is. A two-person show that will make every young man and woman want to perform it, this is a terrific CD. Buy it today!I also recommend Brown's ""Songs for a New World"""
4,Brilliant!,"Brilliant musical by Jason Robert Brown. The music is lively and touching, and the lyrics are great.Highly recommended!"
5,the best of Maisie,"My 2 year old adores this book. We keep it at her grandmas house and she rushes to see it every time we visit. Not really a book - more like a dolls house that happens to fold flat and looks like a book! Actually when open it has 3 rooms - kitchen, bedroom and bathroom together with Maisie and lots of bits and pieces like her panda, clothes, food, hairbrush, soap, toothpaste, towel, cup,etc. Each room has lots of things to examine - the cover on the bed lifts up, the bedroom curtain pulls changing from day to night scene, the chest of drawers drawers pull out - the list is endless!! My little girl likes to take Maisie through a days routine and this includes undressing her, putting her in the shower or bath and then gently rubbing her with the cardboard towel saying ""snug as a bug"". A real joy. I know she would have loved it from about age 1 had I known about it then."
3,An Okay Read,My two favorite stories were from Anela Knight and Maggie Shayne. The otheres were okay not the best but readable.
4,"Hot, Hot, Hot","Skip over Maggie Shayne and Freehan's stories and zero in on Angela Knight. Boy does she have a future! Finally Emma Holly gives us Bastien's story, it's okay but still too short."
5,Head For The Lounge,"Atomic Cocktails is a great book if you are interested in mixing up some potent potables, but you can find a thousand other books that give you the same information. What separates this book from the pack is the retro-packaging. Done up in a kitschy, campy style, the book harkens back to the lounge lizard days of the 50's & 60's. The book honors the time when drinking a martini was the height of cool and does the fine art of mixing drinks proud."
1,This is aweful!,Not at all what i was expecting. Very deceiving photo. It is just one seat cover. Not what I was expecting from the title custom!
5,Inexhaustible wonder,"""Surrealism"" is an overused word these days, drained of much of its original power ... but just open these startling pages of collage & you'll rediscover that it's still just as potent. Both disturbing dream & benign nightmare, the non-narrative accumulates in woozy intensity as you immerse yourself in it, swept away willingly by its ghostly flood of images. Like a genuine dream, there are constant, tantalizing hints of unfulfilled meaning -- it almost makes sense, but never quite does -- but that's not frustrating in the least. Instead, depending on your moods, you'll find multiple meanings ... or you can simply enjoy the experience itself, without trying to find some rational skeleton behind it all. And if it leads you to more of Max Ernst's work, all the better! Highly recommended!"
4,Sturdy and fun for a truck's fan,"This is a big bright sturdy book whit colorful pictures of real trucks, my son loves trucks and he can read his book for long time (I consider 15 minutes long for my 3year old) and just go over and over at this point he had memorized all the names, he has several trucks, transportation, machines etc..kind of books and to be honest, almost all the books have the same pictures but he loves a new book! and this one is nice.I just got this book, it is a 2011 edition and the error mentioned in another review about the ""tractor plow"" had been corrected and it reads ""tractor and disc"".I will say that my favorite transportation picture book is ""Let's get moving (My first DK publishing)"" it has more vehicules not only trucks and 28 pages insted of just 12, it's smaller and not as sturdy but it has hold on."
4,He really loves it! (bores me a little),"I'm trying to be fair, it's advertised as a picture book full of different trucks, it's exactly that, and my 17 month old loves it. It's big, and sturdy, pictures are professionally treated and vibrant. It's a good version of exactly what's advertised. It's got no story though, just 6 or so big pages of pictures of different kind of trucks, and they've got names like hay bailer truck, so I'm not exactly teaching my kid truck names from it. It's not my favorite thing to see him pull of the shelf and bring over to me (which is why it's 4 stars instead of 5) but it's a good, big version of exactly what's advertised."
1,Buyer Beware - It's a Mini-Book,"I thought I was buying a full sized ""hardcover"" edition of this book. When it arrived, I was disappointed to find that it was a miniaturized version, approximately 2 x 3 inches. It would make a cute little gift item, but I'm not sure that it contains the entire text of Dr. Peale's book.Buyer beware! You have to dig down a few levels to get the product details and only there does it describe this book as a miniature version."
1,Size Matters,"This miniature edition is too small to be of much value. When I purchased it, it was not at all obvious that it was a miniature edition, and I was shocked when it arrived. If you're already familiar with the book, it may be a helpful reminder, but it is no way to become familiar with Dr. Peale's work. It is not worth the 4.95 I paid for it, and the 3.99 shipping and handling is ludicrous."
1,"Dr. Peales book is excellent, but this version is NOT!","This book is so small I had to look for it pretty hard to find it in the mailing package. It has also been edited. It is practically useless!!! My advice, buy another version of the book."
3,"Buy the original, not the mini",I was a bit disappointed when I received my shipment.I had ordered the hard copy not realizing it was the mini version of the original.I didn't feel like sending it back so I just read through it.It contains alot of spiritual information that if practiced will help you see the brighter side of things.I still want to read the original so I will probably pick it up on my next trip to the bookstore.
4,Wonderful Tale,"I remember this book from years past. It was good to re-visit it again. My only wish was that it was available through iBooks, too."
4,Keeps my kid inside,And my husband can actually open it from the outside when he comes home from work even if we're not there.
2,Very Disappointing,"The arrangements on this album were so heavy handed that it sounded more like background music from a 1950's movie than an instrumental version of opera's most beautiful melodies.For example, instead of allowing the strings to replace the voice in 'Vissi d'Arte,' it is played as a muddy musical 'all-skate.' A MUCH better version of this as well as other classics can be found on the other 'Opera Without Words' albums. PLEASE skip this one."
3,Reviewing Dr. Scholl,"I really like Dr. Scholl's because my toes can be free. I like the fit and the sound they make when I walk. There is one down side to the ones I just bought from Amazon, after just one week, I found I had to have the heal redone. They wore down quite fast. The replacement heal is much more substantial."
2,Dr. Scholls Exercise Sandals-Not that they used to be,"I wore Dr. Scholls Exercise Sandals for about 10 years and loved them. I was hoping for the same sandal when I ordered these. My foot size has not changed over the years, but these sandals don't fit correctly. The ""ball"" doesn't hit at the right place and the leather rubs my foot. Also, I can't adjust the strap. I've read and re-read the instructions, but nothing I do will release the buckle so that I can tighten the shoe. The leather is stiff and uncomfortable."
4,great quality shoes - very cute!,"These shoes take some getting used to - it is best to wear them around the house for a while before you wear them out in order to get used to the feel. They are very high quality and very attractive - I can wear them with jeans, shorts, dresses - most any summertime clothing."
5,Tried & true must-have: THE ORIGINAL EXERCISE SANDAL!,"I really love these, I finally have a pair again. They haven't changed at all and that's good, I like that they haven't messed with it. Although they do have more conventional styles of shoes for those who won't go the way of tradition. I had a pair of these when I was a teenager. I used to wear them with shorts, skirts, jeans. They make this wonderful wooden clopping sound when walking, which is fun in itself. Your toes will grip the front to keep them from sliding off. Which brings up a point...if they slip off while you're walking or in a fast stride it's gonna hurt like nobody's business. I've had that happen a few times in my day and it is very painful. But I survived. Ya live and learn. Enjoy!"
3,I love these shoes!,"I always wanted a pair of genuine Dr. Scholl's exercise sandals and I finally have a pair! They look and feel so sexy. I found a great price and the shipping was fast, too."
3,Lonnie gets 3 and a half...,"This album is decent mild funk/soul/jazz, but includes occasional vocals that I can do without. Although his message is admirable, Lonnie's singing style seems a little bit too New Age and contrived for my tastes. I prefer the instrumentals on this LP, notably the sublime ""Devika (Goddess)"" which the Hip-Hop group Digable Planets sampled on their first album. It's subtle, soulful, and is THE standout on this album. There are some other pleasant cuts on this LP like ""Sunset"" which has a very laid back, airy type of groove to it and ""Summer Nights"" (appropriately titled for the same reason) which concludes the LP. ""Visions of a New World"" is a moody album for those intimate moments that would benefit from a discreet, mid-tempo vibe."
5,Taken on a journey of the high seas with Errol Flynn,"Childhood memories revisited, a favorite. Adventure, clean romance and much fun! I watched it twice in one day and the enjoyment doubled."
4,Tough guy action.,Another great 12 episode serial from the late 1940's with plenty of action and suspense. We like it because we can play it all day while we do other things and it always has something new we didn't notice before. I would recommend it for 1930/40's action movie enthusiasts.
4,In the begining there was Batman....,If your into the early Batman movies this is the one for you..Michael Keaton & Kim Bassinger along with Jack Nicholson are great in this early Batman movie...
5,THIS IS AWSOME,This film is so awsome The music was great.The fighting was good. And the acting was good to.So take my advice and buy this film.Rating PG-13 for violence and some languge
4,I thought this was a good movie and I recommend it on DVD,This is a great film on DVD. The best one yet. This a movie that may have even let you root for the bad guy. So I give this 4 stars out of 5.
3,"A pretty good movie, but not good Batman...","I Adore Tim Burton. I also Adore Batman. I highly anticipated this film when it was being made, however I was greatly disappointed. While it isn't a bad movie, it is terrible Batman.Batman isn't about gadgets and things. Batman is about a man who turns himself into the ultimate crime-fighting machine, and that's something that just got lost in the live-action transition to the big screen. If you want to see some really good Batman, try the unedited version of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker."
4,A fascinating interpretation,"I have never been a comic book reader, so if you're familiarization with Batman stems from comics you might as well move one. My real familiarity with the character stems from the rediculous sixties TV show and the cartoon. Based on that the movies was inarguably superior. This movie portrays Batman in a dark, gothic, vigilante light that makes him somehow more real and understandable. I think Michael Keaton was an excellent Batman, in that he was not very heroic in and of himself. Thus he represented the everyman quality that the average viewer could relate to. Jack Nicholson was (of course) brilliant. I enjoyed this film. The second film was o.k. and it went quickly down hill from there"
2,This film REEKS.,"This film is crummy. Micheal Keaton was without a doubt the WORST BATMAN! Val Kilmer is the best Batman. It didn't have the ""comicbook"" look to it like the others. You didn't get as much of a Gotham feel. Like old cars and so on. It looked like New York. You can see it if you must but... It's nowhere near as good as Forever. The suit wasn't tight enough, so it was flopping around on his face. Anyone can look like Batman, but only some can look like Bruce Wayne. An old, fat, short ugly Bruce Wayne isn't exactly what most picture as Batman. The only one who has been spoke of that could do worse is Kurt Russel. At least he dosn't wear tights! (boy would his gut show then)"
3,The 1st and the 2nd,"This of may of beeen the first of the modern ""Batman"" films, but it was the 2nd best. ""Batman Returns"" shows the true dark genius of a man named Tim Burton, it represented everything which the following ""Batman"" films destroyed and I love it for that. As for this film, I must say that the final showdown between Batman and the Joker + henchman is significantly better than the one in the sequel. The scene is which Batman flies up his plane in front of the film is priceless Burton cinema. Jack Nicholson is his usual crazy self, and Michael Keaton will always be ""Batman"" for me. 3/5 stars."
1,"Sadly disappointing, depressed dark images portrayed. 0 star","Why would anyone want to listen to dark, dreary stories of the undead, Angels that drink blood, this book was very misrepresented in the title. ""Deamon"" fantasies is much more appropriate. I was looking forward to a spiritual uplifting, instead I threw all the tapes and box into the trash, right where it belongs."
5,Cool Book,"I loved scratch and sniff books when I was a kid. This is a great one because it teaches and also has great smells. Unlike most scratch and sniff books, it keeps the smell for a long time."
2,Disappointed,"Scratch n sniff book was described as gently used or like new....was anything but. Some of the pages have no smell, and each scratch pad is worn down. A more accurate description wouldve been appreciated."
2,Disappointment,"Whitman is brilliant, but as a writer he suffers from some serious defects. Chief among them is his obsession with proving academics wrong. Rather than write much on how he thinks through and makes real-world investments, he spends most of his ink distinguishing value investing from Efficient Market Theory and Graham-and-Doddism. It gets old, and dull. And he constantly qualifies his statements with ""probably"", ""would seem"", and so on, and undermines himself. The writing also utterly lacks any sense of humor. Finally, I was disappointed that Whitman--who is an astute and detail-oriented investor--did not include more case examples, with financials, to show his reasoning and method at work.His first outing, The Aggressive Conservative Investor, is better in many ways, but is still turgidly written.Given Whitman's talents, track record and reputation for smarts, this is a real let-down."
1,Very boring book,"If your a Professor of English this book might be up your alley. Otherwise, stay away!The first essay is about an adult film awards show. it's lengthy and rather hilarious. But the rest of the book is a snoozer."
2,"Go Back to SAMS, Harry :(","I found previous book by Harry, SBS 4.5 in 21 days a really excellent book and looked forward to the SBS2K Version.Sadly disappointed - lots of unecessary stuff (like a 6 page line by line listing of ICW ins file) and major gaps in important areas; far too much of a sell on Net Meeting as form of remote control, yet little detail on configuring RAS.Another reviewer noted:""This book needs an editor...As proof of this I also bought Harry's ""MCSE Consulting Bible"" which was published by IDG Books. This book is well edited and Harry comes across as the smart and informed business man I'm sure he is. This is a 5 star book. What a difference an editor makes!""Apparently, Harry fell out with SAMS and went to Brelsford with this book; I can't help wonering if it was something to do with editorial policy ? If so, go back to SAMS, Harry, your technical knowledge is superb but you really do need a good editor to get your writing better focusedMartin Harran"
2,Don't buy this book,"I completely agree with Gary's comment below. This book is of little value except for those who have very limited knowledge of small business networking. This is to say, this book may be useful for those who are NOT in the IT consulting business.You won't get any warm and fuzzy feeling, if you are looking for valuable insights of running MS Small Business Server 2000 as the title of this book implies. In most cases, the author tip toes around the most basic concepts, congurations and setups without any appreciable new insights in very verbose albeit walm and friendly fashion.This book really should have been part of the ""Dummies"" series, as it serves inexperienced business persons or very incompetant consultant types but not technical persons with hands-on experiences in NT and 2000.Notice how so many glorious reveiws are from Washington State. My suspision is that authors' buddies have helped him out on this. This is NOT a five star book, period."
3,Light read,"Great story for a vacation book. Kept my interest for two long plane rides. Good escape reading, likable characters and setting"
3,fun read but an awkward plot,This came up in my book club. I really enjoyed here characters and her descriptions of the places but not much of a plot. I thought it was a murder mystery but no one died til the middle of the book.I'll give the author another try.
4,Southern charm!,"Eloise Foley is in a bad place in her life. Recently divorced from Tal Evans, she now lives in the carriage house, behind her former home where Tal lives with his new girlfriend, Caroline. Her finances are shaky and she earns a meager living from being a ""picker"" who finds antiques for dealers. As if this isn't bad enough, she discovers a dead body and immediately she is a suspect in the murder. This book is set in the beautiful city of Savannah, and it involves antiques, old houses, and crooked men who are cheating their clients. Eloise, or ""Wheezy"" as she is called, is a spunky, delightful heroine who makes a lot of mistakes in a new relationship, but who manages to land on her feet. This is recommended reading."
3,"Not ""like new"" as labeled","This book was listed as ""like new"" and it was not. It had creases and folded pages. I also didn't realize it was the very small paper back size."
5,Savannah Blues,Mary Kay has an entire series that goes with Savannah Blues. They are all wonderful. Since Savannah is my hometown. She is witty and wonderful. I own all of her books and can't wait till the next one comes out.
2,Savannah Blues - Boring,I picked this book up after reading Spring Fever and enjoying it. I am sorry to say I did not like this book and struggled to finish it. I found all the details about antiquing b-o-r-i-n-g. Weezie and BeBe were annoying. Weezie's relationship (if you want to call it that) with Daniel was eh. I did not think they had chemistry at all. The book was too far fetched and the humor was too exaggerated.
3,Easy Summer Reading ...,"... if it were not for the distracting ""a historical"" appearing repeatedly throughout this novel. Please! It's ""an historical"" and I'm amazed that not only was it not known by Ms. Andrews, but not caught in editing."
5,Love this author!,"Little by little, I am reading everything by Mary Kay Andrews. She writes the best stories. Her characters are well developed, very likeable, and there is just the right amount of humor thrown in. Once I sit down to read, it is very easy to get lost in the story. It flows well and is so entertaining. I want to go picking with Weezie!!"
5,Savannah Blues,Contemporary Romantic Comedy with a mystery wound through it all - exactly the right book at the right time. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to get hold of the sequel!
2,Not much for the money,"The canisters are lighter than I would have liked with lids that fit, if anything, too tightly. Accessing my morning tea now demands a few moments of serious isometric exercise. Aesthetically, no complaints, but I would not have bought these had I had the opportunity to handle them in a bricks and mortar store. Certainly nothing special for the price."
4,Classic,"this is classic Gil Scott Heron, I was seeking some of his later music however. I would recommend this to all."
4,Pure flava,"I really can't say much 'bout this album. But this man made be the next millenium of smooth jazz. I first heard the song ""Pocket Change"" (one of my favorites), it just interests me since I'd been an instant fan of his 4 the first time. It came in 2001 and I heard it play on the smooth jazz station 107.5 WJZZ in Atlanta, GA.I can't wait to pick up all of his albums I mean some ocassionally for example. That's an album I look forward of copping ASAP. God bless Chuck Loeb 4 doing such a wonderful job on this record.And check out my man Jeff Golub too on past releases like ""Do it Again"" and ""Soul Sessions"" and especially my man Jeff Lorber on ""Philly Style""."
4,well thought out,"This book contains several rarely seen pictures of the band. Some are action shots, while others are stills.. All in all, this book captures the G'N'R' attitude very well!"
3,"Hear her live, she's worth it","Ana Vidovic, in this recording, comes across as a ""phenom."" Exceptional technique but a guitarist who has some growing and maturing to do. Put differently, her technique exceeds her emotional grasp of the music.About two years ago we were fortunate to hear Ana perform live at a Philadelphia Classical Guitar Society concert. She has grown tremendously. She still has a world class technique, but her playing, her grasp of the music was simply wonderful, one of the best classical guitar recitals I have heard in years. The Society's reviewer wrote of the concert: ""Come back Ana, soon and often!""Hopefully the CD reviewed here will be the first of many. Few guitarists of any age play as Ana does in this disc. She is capable of much more, and deserves the widest possible audience."
2,Sneaky design flaw with back,"Discovered that the plastic back has a weird flaw--the linear slots are just wide enough to allow pant back pocket buttons through and just narrow enough to grab and pop off the buttons when you stand up. In fact, the back is highly efficient at this annoying maneuver. I contacted the seller the Backstor/VitalityWeb and they basically said it's my problem. $300 for a new upholstered back. So much for high end service with your high end chair."
3,Weak,Silversteins first album was sick- it was a little too poppy in a few places but had very dynamic melodies and was filled with savage hardcore breakdowns- badass. The second CD they recycled the same lyrics- made them even whinier- genericed up their sound a bit- lost most of the brutal melodies that made the first CD interesting- and essentially shat out an album. I wont say its terrible- I still say they're a talented band and there are a few good songs- but overall it's pretty halfass.
5,Even better...,"I loved the first Silverstein album but I ADORE this one. In there debut, they had a young sound and didn;t quite know what they were doing, and yet they were still great. In there second effort they sound the same, yet more experienced which therefore, makes it better. If you want to check out a song from this album watch the video for ""Smile in your sllep"" it will make you an instant beleiver."
1,Whole Lotta Scooping Goin' On,"Let's be very blunt. I don't like the way this ensemble sings this music, but you will find little choice if you want to hear these profound compositions by Pierre de la Rue, one of the most brilliant contemporaries of Josquin. The price is low enough; perhaps you'll find the vocal technique less of an obstacle to your listening pleasure.Months later: I'd forgotten what I wrote about this disaster until I tried to listen to it again. It's worse than I first thought. The amazing thing is that the Ars Antiqua de Paris is a venerable ensemble, founded in 1965. It's a disservice to Pierre da la Rue, a very great composer, to keep this beast in circulation. If you really want to hear Pierre de la Rue, and you should want to, I can recommend three 5-star CDs:The Clerks' Group: de la Rue & Brumel RequiemsThe Clerks' Group: de la Rue Missa de Sancta CruceGothic Voices: de la Rue Missa de Feria & Missa Sancta Dei genitrix"
4,great show!,As usual the Arthur stories are age appropriate and have a message for our little ones. We use them at school on days when the children have to come in early (below zero or pouring) and have a few minutes before the regular schedule begins. The length of the stories are just right. It is also a nice way to quiet them down so that they are ready to focus on their next task. The themes are also a good jumping off point for discussion or creative writing.
5,"well-written lesson, but you must learn it within 60 days","Keep in mind that the evaluation copy of the software expires in 60 calendar days. If life gets busy and you have to shelve your lessons for a little while (like I did), you'll never be able to use the evaluation software to practice. So I'm afraid this nicely presented book will sit on my shelf and gather dust."
3,"Boring, but Ok","I usually play this CD while driving since it's the only time that I can force myself to listen to it. I don't think I could listen to it twice, though...I just wish it would be a bit more entertaining. After a while it gets really boring...However if you can resist you can eventually not only memorize the verbs, but also learn how to pronounce them correctly.Not a bad buy after all, especially helpful if you have hard time falling asleep..."
2,"""The Plan"" of becoming conformed to the image of Christ.","I absolutely love the music of the Osmonds. I just wish they would have released one of their other albums on CD instead of this one, particularly ""The Proud One,"" ""Osmonds,"" ""Crazy Horses"" or ""Love Me For A Reason.""This is a concept album, focused around the Osmonds Mormon belief system about men conformed to the image of Christ.Given that the album has a ""spiritual"" theme, I've always been surprised that the album has a certain heaviness or darkness to it that's lacking on their other albums, with the exception of the wonderfully inspirational ""Let Me In.""I love the Osmonds music and hope they'll release their other albums on CD, cause I'd love to buy them all again..."
4,Endless Celestial Tunes,"I'm sure the osmonds put alot of creativity into writing this concept album, but noone can top the creativity of the conceptor (aka Joseph Smith and friends). When one can claim that he carried gold tablets that would equal about 400 lbs thats creative. To claim God's real name is Eloheim, and that he lives on the ""starbase Kolob"" well thats even more creative than any rock song out there. Then to convey the message and sell it to millions of people. Well thats better than any record lable could do with some rock groups songs. I find it interesting that the Osmonds chose the insert art that includes a ""mormon"" with an owl in the background. Perhaps they are refering to molech or another false god because Elohiem is not the name of God. God is Jehovah, and he has given us all there is to know in the new testement, he fulfilled the old testament, and left no room for Joseph Smith to add to it in the 1800's."
4,Underrated,"I would never say the Knack were a great band. As with most of Paul McCartney's solo work, the Knack's records come off rather shallow and callow (so maybe those Beatles comparisons aren't so far off!). Even so, dammit, I like Round Trip. Basically, it's consistently above average power pop with the occasional foray into psychedelia (the sarcastic Beatlesque peace 'n' love anthem ""Radiating Love"" and the creepy Beatlesque demonic possession tune ""We Are Waiting;"" dig that rockin' chorus sung in Hebrew!) and jazz-inflected pop (""Africa"" and ""Lil' Cal's Big Mistake""). Two tracks, ""Soul Kissin'"" and ""She Likes the Beat"" sound like outtakes from Nick Lowe's Labour of Lust album (that's a huge compliment, in case you aren't familiar with that particular classic record)."
3,"three great songs, the rest of album is pretentions garbage","Just Wait And See; Boys Go Crazy; Another Lousy Day In Paradise are classic My Sharona style Knack. Great...unfortunatly, the rest of is is memorable only for how God awful BAD it is. The first four songs are truly bad attempts to imitate other styles by other more successful artist. She likes the beat is just plain boring, repeating the same 4 words over and over and calling it a song. Up until 1996, copies of this record could be found in used stores around L.A. for 50 cents. I saw 8 copies in one Pasadina store alone. Really bad, embarrasingly awful. Couldn't they have broken up before this? Proof that drugs and rock dont mix well."
2,Book is as dry as the desert road to Turketsan,"I only read about 100 pages, and I'm not sure how I even got that far. It's not that the book is poorly written, for lack of a better phrase, nor is it that Lattimore's trip was boring. Maybe it was, can't really put my finger on it.But Lattimore's account of the trip is just excruciating to read! For starters, Lattimore jumps around from one topic to another in the same chapter, and many times goes off on these tangents, all without any seemingly good reason.For a book about an explorer's account of a trip, Sven Hedin's MY LIFE AS AN EXPLORER is much more well written and will keep you much more suspense."
4,"Thick, thick, thick sheets","These sheets feel good, crisp, but nothing like I expected. My 800 and 600 count sheets are much softer than these. But, I expect these will outlast the others due to the thickness of the fabric. My hubby and I like the feel, however, my other lower count sheets are thinner and do feel a lot softer. A benefit to these is they are sized quite large, and fit my oversized mattress much better than any other ""oversized"" sheet has so far. They are not pulling off the corners at all, as a matter of fact, there is extra room! That is a first with this mattress."
2,Not so soft,I bought the 1200 ct sheets because I wanted an ultra-soft sheet but was disappointed. The sheets are extremely heavy and will no doubt wear for years but they are not soft ... even after several washings. I should have returned them immediately but kept thinking that one more washing would soften them up .... wrong!
1,Scratchy sheets,These sheets are like 200 cotton count not 1200 cotton count. Do not order you will be sorry!!!
3,good - not great,"When I first opened the package of sheets, I was stunned. They were very, very stiff. Almost reminded me of sailcloth. I have washed them twice, and they have softened up some. They are comfortable to sleep on, and so far have retained their sheen after two washings in warm water, and through the dryer. But, I have felt other sheet sets that were over 1000 thread count, and they were softer than these are.I did not find any problems with the sewing or quality, in fact they are very well stitched, and it looks very tailored to me. The color is very nice - a taupe color I would call latte - not parchment. To me parchment is an off white or ecru.The bottom sheet is a generous size, and fits oversized mattresses. I was dissappointed with the top sheet though. I woud have expected it to be a little larger for the price and quality of these sheets."
1,Umm..........,"I can sum up this movie in two words: It sucks. Now don't get me wrong, I agree that this movie is great for kids, it provides a great alternative to all the terrible movies out there but it does a terrible job of capturing what it is to be a ""aggressive skater"" (which is a term that no one uses anymore). I've been in the in-line industry for over 9 years and I've never, ever run into a ""soul skater"", I've never run into any one that dresses like Brink or his friends that actually skate and so forth. Now I realize that they had to ""mainstream"" skating to make it reachable to the general audience but ""Airborne"" does ten times better then this movie, and that was done almost 8 years ago when skating was still in it's infancy. Sorry, but I'd rather go pick up something like Malibu,CA or Saved By the Bell then this movie."
1,not what i thought,most of the songs where not the original artist. i never would have purchased this album if i would have known this
5,Great Bulgarian folk music by great musicians,"I am a Bulgarian (and Balkan) folk music fan and I love this album. This Icelandic group captures the essence and the energy of Bulgarian folk music. The ""big band"" sound adds depth to the melody. It is nice for once to listen to Bulgarian folk music without the female choirs ; it is, in my opinion, one of the most complex (rythm) and rich (instruments) types of music there is. I would not recommend listening to this album as background music ; to really enjoy it, you need to turn up the volume a notch and be attentive ... be in the moment. Great album !"
3,Great item for the lower price of 19.99,"This is a cool little palm pilot, the only problem that I've found it when the batteries die... so does your 6000 entries! It flashes low battery for just a moment or 2 before you are dead in the water. I learned that lesson the hard way, then always kept a spare set of rechargables in my purse and switched them asap. If you use it for the alarm reminder setting, you may NOT get to it in time to change batteries and save your info. This happened to me twice, then I started using my phone as a reminder if I needed it and using this just to store info and that helped alot. At 99.99, I would say pass on it... but today the price is 19.99 and it is WELL worth that price!"
2,Yawn,"For the reviewer that said this is what House of the Devil wanted to be... reverse that and you've got it right. House of the Devil was slow but had loads of charisma and did a great job of capturing the 80's feel and slowly building to a worthy climax. Babysitter Wanted had several flaws the worst of which was predictability with the ""killer"" but the acting was pretty bad too. A couple of decent gore scenes but it really fell short of what I expected based on the reviews. The BD was pretty weak, DD 2.0 (on a 2008 release seriously?), no pop-up menu, and upconverted DVD PQ.. I even ejected it to make sure blockbuster didn't send me a dvd by mistake.My recommendation is skip, even for a rental. There are plenty of similar sub-genre horror films like Farm House, The Girl Next Door, House of the Devil, Them (Ils), etc. with better script, better acting, and more compelling stories to hook in your skin."
5,Psichedelic from beggining to end.,"If you are looking for weird sounds, a lot of panning and some great progressive psychedelic songs this is the album for you. In this record I've heard some of the most amazing examples of hard trance that tends toward a darker slower sound.The first track is an accelerator that prepares you to what will come next. Although I enjoyed practically every track in this record ""encrusted filth "" is worth mentioning. In this track you will find one the greatest example of what progressive trance is coming to be.The album is for psychedelic lovers, in special the people who like to listen carefully to every detail a song has to offer. Every time you listen there's something new going on.All tracks are around 8 to 9 minutes, with some lasting a little more.If you enjoyed the Triptamin compilation take a closer look, this one is more noisy. A crush in the stomach. Beautiful."
1,SLIM ON THE REAL SLIM,I just felt like I never really got to know Slim in this book. There are many areas where he keeps his cards close to his vest. The writing is rather flat page after page and in reading this I wanted to know more about the man and less about his victories and losses at the table.
1,What's The Point?,"So I guess what makes a man ""legendary"" is that he's willing to take advantage of and even cheat anyone he comes in contact with. I expected gambling stories when I unfortunately bought this tedious book. Instead I got a bunch of self-gloryfying tales about a one dimensional lowlife. If this excites you great. But I prefer the books by T. Holden and M. Konik for real insight into the mind of gamblers as opposed to con artists."
4,One of a kind,"They don't make 'em like Slim anymore. I came to this with an interest in poker, but the book doesn't dwell on the intricacies of that game. Rather it allows the reader to spend a couple of hours in the company of a funny, colorful, slyly intelligent Texan with a lot of great stories and a hilarious way with words. Follow Slim through pool halls, golf courses and grand casinos as he makes his fortune betting (not really gambling if you know you're gonna win!). Slim is a natural storyteller and makes this book hard to put down. My only quibble is that the author portrays himself as a loving family man underneath it all, while looking down his nose at the Pablo Escobars and Larry Flynts he took money from.Still, a great book and a fun read."
3,Whaley gives a great performance,"Frank Whaley (Pulp Fiction, Swimming With Sharks, School Of Rock) stars a Jimmy, a stand up comedian who isnt that funny. He works with his friend, played by Ethan Hawke (Before Sunset, Assualt On Precinct 13, Taking Lives), at a Grocery store. He has a wife Annie, played by Carla Gugino (Sin City, Spy Kids, Tv's Spin City) and they have a daughter. Jimmy's life takes a bunch of turns, his wife Annie cant stand the life she's living, the house she's living in and Jimmy, so she takes their daughter and goes back to live with her mom. Jimmy gets fired from the Grocery store from taking beer and then jumps around with different jobs. His comedy really sucks and their are scenes where he gets into fights with the audience members. The movie itself is good, but the good part is Whaley giving a great performance and also taking a crack at written and directing."
3,"title over sells it's power...but, hey I bought it!","I learned some things, and I disagreed with several things, decent read if you have the time and will apply what little you may take away from this one, don't ""buy"" the cover."
4,Xzibit's 4th album is 3 1/2 Mics,"Well ""Release date"" is a sick song where Xzibit shows off his full lyrical ability.""Multiply"" is not musically superior but it is a fun little song.""Heart of Men"" has the same beat as Ja Rule used on Murder Reign and is a standout cut.""Harder"" has a good hook to it.""BK to LA"" is a nice track.""Missin you"" has a nice beat and he does good as is ""Right on"" and he ends it off good with the last cut.This CD is average wherever you say average is from 3 to 4 Mics that is where this is.Lyrics 8 Production 7 X Factor 9 Classic 7 Replay 8"
5,overwhelmed,"... I think this is one of the best albums we've heard from him. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed Restless, but this new CD kicks .... People don't seem to like #8 (choke me, spank me) but that's my favorite. It's a little different than the rest of the CD. He's got a whole new flow happening, and change is good.As for the rest of the album... another smash hit. Hope anyone who purchases this CD enjoys it as much as the rest of us true, loyal Xibit fans."
4,Good CD!,"This is the first Xzibit album i've bought so I can't compare to previous releases. But I like this album. Xzibit kicks dope rhymes along with dope beats. He doesn't need to have a major single on an album along with 12 mediocre tracks. He can go deep and rap with meaning, as he does in Realease Date, which is about prison life. The best track is Heart Of Man where he raps about life. Some people are dissing the sample of 'Africa', but i think it sounds dope. He also makes a tribute to his mother on Missing You. He also made the right choices as far as guest appearances are concerned: Eminem, Dr Dre, Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, MOP, Golden State Project and Antony Hamilton on the dope 'Gambler'. So if you're fed up of Ja Rule and Nelly buy a real hip hop album like this you won't regret it. Although avoid tracks 8 and 16."
4,Error,While transfering this CD to iPod itune named track 3 on disk 2INTO THE BLUE but box has SAW YOU RUNNING as does AMAZON.COM and other music store on internet.Maybe I got a import copy with different track.
5,Memorable China Beach,"I keep checking to see if this has been released. I was late teens/early twenties during the original airdates and can honestly say that no show has ever induced such powerful emotions from me as China Beach did. I would schedule my college classes around the airing time so I wouldn't miss it. My mom, sister and I would surround the TV and the tears and laughter flowed. I WISH I had taped on the VCR all the episodes as it appears we will never see this on DVD.... :("
5,"ZAK IS HOT!!!!!!!, well I do have a large interest in ghosts.","Ok, that is a given, I watch every episode that is availbale through my Roku, thanks AMAZON, and my NETFLIX subscription, one of the best choices bedsides my choice for soulmate that I ahve ever made."
4,Scary real stuff! Awesome!,Great documentary. Always liked ghost adventures and this prequel is great! I like how real and honest these guys are and how they back up their evidence with experts. Creepy good!
2,Worked for a day then dumped water on the floor,"We've been going through humidifiers trying to find a good one. I was attracted to this one because Costco sells it and we could return it for a refund if it stopped functioning at any time.Well, on day 3 it went back to costco. The ultrasonic transducer stopped functioning to produce vapor and on top of that it started leaking on the floor. Overnight it would drop the contents of the entire reservoir.I had high hopes. This would be a great unit - if it worked."
3,interesting,"i like the racial swing this film takes.the Indian Kid trying to fit in with the american Landscape&culture at college.this film tends to last a bit too long,but it has moments that hold your attention. the Humor is there.&this film has a good ending that will move you. this film was pretty good,but needed to be edited down by 30-40 minutes.not all what I expected&that is a good thing."
2,"Go Back to Being a Backup, Deb","She may have great abilities at playing a guitar (as she proved being Albert Collins' backup), but as a vocalist, Debbie would be best to go into country music. A blues singer she isn't, and this album shows it. Had ""Howling at the Moon"" been released as a country song, it would have hit it big. The rest of this album is terrible. Another white female that tries to do the blues....and can't. Janis Joplin, Bonnie Raitt, and Joan Osborne are the only ones to have succeeded so far. Try one of their albums!"
5,Texas Cowboy Cooking Cookbook,"This book is awesome. I sat and read it cover to cover because it not only has awesome recipes, it has a story as well. Tom and Lisa Perini are super people and we have eaten at their restaurant in Buffalo Gap as well. All the recipes are ""doable"" with common ingredients that you have in the kitchen. i've given several copies as gifts. Be sure and try the Bread Pudding recipe. I thought I could make it.....his is OUTSTANDING."
4,Texas Cowboy Cooking,Wonderful recipes full of flavor and dripping with tastes from the wild west. Beautiful photography of cowboys and cattle drives complete the imagery. The herb crusted beef tenderloin and bread pudding in whiskey sauce are unbelievable. Enjoy!
1,Planned obsolescence?,"I have the same problem - the tip of my Kensington adapter has failed. I'm more than a bit skeptical of Kensington's design seeing as there are apparently no moveable parts inside and the connections that failed are encased in half an inch of plastic. And now, 18 months after I bought the adapter, Kensington is selling a new, ""improved"" version with incompatible tips. Is this planned obsolescence? It is a plausible conclusion to draw, at least."
4,Fascinating personal story,"This is really less a scathing indictment of Pat Robertson than it is of fundamentalism in general. Mr. Straub is actually still a Christian, although of an altogether different bent than what he once was. With fundamentalism, it becomes apparent how Robertson and those at CBN saw everything as an ""us/them"" issue, where they were always believed to be in the right. The anecdotes of CBN staffers leaving tracts in the homes of ""unsaved"" Catholics or with everyone from passers-by to toll-both attendants were telling. When one believes they're always in the right, they'll justify anything. Look at Pat's ""Diamond Mine"" ventures with Mobutu Sese Seko (...).Overall a very quick and informative read."
3,Typical footage,"This DVD had alot of stock and misleading shots. In several places vehicles that had not seen active service with the Wehrmacht since 1941 were shown as examples of common equipment in the late WW II period. In one instance I did find what they hose to be very interesting - a series of quick clips showing Pz II's being delivered to the field on tank transporters. I was unable to tell if this was pre-War footage or if they were being deployed before on of the early offensives, but I can honestly say that I have nevere seen, in stills or moving footage, the use of tank transport trucks on German armored vehicles. Plenty of rail footage, but no truck transports. I was impressed and did stop review of those scenes with mymouth open."
2,Cracked after 3 uses,"wok quickly cracked after 3 uses (that is counting the seasoning as well) very heavy, made of cheap metal, save yourself the troubles and go with carbon steel woks."
4,Great Wok!,"This is an excellent wok, perfect fit for my 30"" range. It turns out great stir-frys and it's a breeze to season. I seasoned it a couple of times and it looks great.The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I'd like to have a lid for it (stainless steel or cast iron) and it's unavailable.Great piece to use daily and even better to pass on to your loved ones."
1,"looked like a wok, arrived cracked, twice","Ordered for excellent price. Wok arrived cracked. Obviously in shipment. Very poorly packed. Loose in box with insufficient packing material.Contacted Amazon, they shipped another. It also arrived cracked with same problem with packing. Sent back properly packaged. Requested refund.Yet to get refund. Wok appeared to be fairly good quality, but packing was atrocious."
3,Mediocre band but...,"Well, Clarence White is a great picker but he did himself a disservice hooking upwith this bunch of back-up musicians and this bunch of tunes. Some tunes were good but some weremuddied and poorly recorded. Not recommended."
1,Another no vote for the box,"This packaging is the worst I've seen. It took me ten minutes to get the thing open; and I couldn't stop the disks from rolling around inside and scratching. I now have the disks in a jewel box and am using the case to hold office supplies on my desk.I also expect these comments to be deleted from Amazon as soon as a Columbia rep sees them.As for the music itself: worth having, but wait for a reconfigured box."
3,Swan Reveiw,"I say a person who likes adventure books would like to read The Trumpet of the Swam. They should read this book because it is pretty much a total adventure. There are other types of readers who would enjoy this book but, adventure is the main type. The protagonist(Louis)seems very sad that he can't talk but, he is capable of doing other things without his voice. The antagonist(Louis' father)feels bad for Louis and his condition. Although,when the father steals a brass trumpet he gets Louis in a mess of trouble. My thoughts about The Trumpet of the Swan are that the adventures Louis had repeated sometimes. He always tried to get money to pay back the stolen trumpet. The book got boring at times."
4,The Trumpet of the Swan,"If you like adventure, laughter, and romance, you'll love E.B. White's The Trumpet of the Swan. In this story Louis, a Trumpeter Swan who can't speak, learns to read and write. He learns to play a trumpet to win the love of another very beautiful swan named Serena. But even though Louis has a trumpet, he doesn't own it because his father (the old cob) quickly stole it for him, and so Louis takes on many jobs to get money to pay for the trumpet. Through his adventure, Louis is helped by a very nice boy named Sam Beaver. I strongly reccommend this book for all readers."
4,small group study,We are using this as a small group study. It is very good! Our church and I think many others are having a hard time keeping the attendance in Sunday schools. Therefore we decided to have a small group we meet on Monday nights and study the Bible and it's stories through this study it makes it understandable and easy to teach. It also makes it more comfortable for those that were not raised in the church.
1,Terrible mouse! DO NOT BUY!!,"I bought this mouse for 10 bucks and it isn't even worth 2 bucks! Then thing goes into sleep mode quickly and it takes a long time to wake it up. You have to click a lot and pick it up and try to get the sensor to start working again. Then when you are using it, it doesn't always move or it jumps. I do not recommend this mouse!"
5,Wow. What a bargain!,"I paid twenty bucks for this thing. Amazing. My wife and I used it to put up a tile backsplash that took quite a few cuts. Won't work as well with larger tiles, but for 6"" tile it is awesome."
3,tile saw,"This tile saw is adequate for small home projects. It is a little slow in cutting, especially thicker tiles such as baseboard tiles and making a 45 degree edge cut. Overall, where time is not a factor, it is a very nice little saw to have around. The only other concern may be the quality and lifespan of the blade."
5,EVERYTHING WE NEEDED,I purchased this screen for our contemporary service and it has been everything we expected. Very quiet and a great size.
3,ok,"its good but the center is bowing down a little, the body is not strong enough to carry the weight"
3,Nothing Special,"Unless you have no knowledge of weight lifting, this book is of no use to you. Yes, it does have an awesome stretching routine, but that doesn't justify the price of this book. The weightlifting is nothing special, mainly dumbbell work and plyometrics. All the weightlifting info can be found free if you have access to the internet and an hour to kill. The stretching routine is mainly a gymnastics routine. Its main goal is enabling you to do the splits. If you go to your local library and pick up a book on gymnastics then you'll get a routine that is almost the same.All in all this is a well organized book with tons of detailed picture. It's a great book for the NOVICE WEIGHTLIFTER. My only suggestion is not to the 3 set of 12 reps for any given exercise. Do 2 set of 25 reps each and you'll have better results. You won't get as strong but you'll be stronger longer."
1,DNT BUY FROM THEM!!!! U WILL GET RIPPED OFF!!!,I NEVER GOT IT!!!!!!!!! WTF!!!!!!!! I WANT MY $ BACK....PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE YOU WILL NOT GET WHAT YOU PURCHASED!
1,"Wrong Product, Company was Rude","Same as the other reviews. The listing was incorrect. Purchased product. Did not receive the item that was listed. I contacted their customer service, and they basically told me I was lying. Then they gave a very tedious process for returning the prouduct in order for me to receive a refund. They screwed up, not me. I think they should have just written it off, returned my money, and said ""we appologize for the inconvenience and we are very sorry for the confusion""."
5,Never knew the harsh reality of gangs...,"This book was chosen for our book club this month. I got hooked from the first page. Some parts I had to go back over, because there's some street language, but Monster Kody has a great way of explaining when necessary.It scares me that this is a reality in gangs. That your real family barely counts."
5,this book tells you the real life in south central la,"I had to read a book for my english class, I chosed this book because the cover was tight. When i started reading this book i was all into it. This book make me realize that gangsters ain't that bad after all, they have heart and feelings too. I hope that people will change through this book and that people dont have to go through what ""Monster Kody Scott went through."""
4,Monster: what a character!,"This book is a quick read and is very interesting. The book shows the very violent life of an LA gang member and how and why he does things. This book is somewhat disturbing at times due to the violence and graphic scenes portrayed. It is easy to forget that this book is based on a true story. I wish it were a fiction story, then it would be less troublesome."
2,Pretentious Account of Gang Life,"I started this memoir with very high hopes. It started off good, but quickly dwindled after that. After watching several Kody Scott interviews, I found it extremely difficult to believe he actually wrote this book. I also felt he spent far too much time blaming society for his own flaws instead of taking responsibility for his heinous actions. It's easy to point the finger at parents, authorities and the LA Police Department, but what about HIMSELF? The memoir then becomes a pretentious account of gang life in LA. I didn't feel sorry for Kody Scott at any point, which is what I'm sure he wanted from the reader. Not buying it. Sorry."
3,Shakur reveals the horrifying reality of gangs,"This is a revealing book if it is read right. As he should, the author devotes most of the book to simply describing in detail the crimes committed by himself and other gang members against each other and against ""civilians."" His honesty is refreshing, but what occurred to me was that if you follow the definition of the term, Shakur and gangbangers like him are nothing short of serial killers. It is a crime that Hollywood portrays these guys in a glamorous, sympathetic light. Take away all the flash, the gold, the clothes, and the cars and what you have left is a bloodthirsty brute."
4,I couldn't put it down,"This was an especially gripping story of the life and times of an African-American youth in South Central L.A. I read some of the most interesting chronicles of a young man's life. Kody Scott, later known as Monster, and later, Sanyika Shakur, was inducted into a very dangerous gang called the Crips, whose primarily colors are blue, when he was extremely young in age. He talks about the gruesome crimes he has seen and committed, about the numerous incarcerations, and the light that finally changed him into the man he is today, no longer being violent. I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind. This is one of the best novels I have read in years."
3,false advertisement,"Pure rip off. I'm upset about it too. I bought this DVD because I wanted to purchase a specific video of a particular comedian: Rasheed Thurmond, who is HILARIOUS! If you type his name on this website's search field - the ""bad boys"" video comes up. I distinctly remember that this show is where I first saw Rasheed. Problem? He's NOT on the DVD. The show I saw had Rasheed and way other funny comedians who don't appear on this DVD at all. The seller must have wanted to be safe and kept the mediocre ones for this DVD in my opinion. Rasheed is not for everyone. Either that or what we purchased was the ""short version"" of season 1. He was THE BEST ever on that show. Too funny for words. If you don't believe me, google his name and watch his comedy clips. You will cry laughing. Or take a look here...[....] (scroll down)."
2,Some good mostly bad,I expected a little bit more from something that P-Diddy would sign his name to. There were maybe 3 really funny comedians out of 18 I think. Some parts were down right boring. However I will say when it was funny it was FUNNY. I would say Netflix this if possible.
1,Twice I've received copies with Disc 2 missing,"I'm getting frustrated now with Amazon. I received this set last week that had two copies of Disc 1, with Disc 2 missing. I requested another copy, and it too arrived with Disc 2 missing. I'm eagerly awaiting the chance to listen to both CDs in the set (Disc 1 is great), but I'm sitting here now with 4 copies of Disc 1 and wishing I could hear some of the great tunes on the second disc. I hope Amazon will remedy this."
1,ATTENTION: Defective Discs !!!!,"Bought this from amazon and both discs were defective and would not play on any CD player. Thankfully amazon refunded my money in full, but save yourself the trouble.It WOULD be an awesome album if only the cd's worked....*sigh*..."

5,brilliant,"This book is the best account of the Holocaust trial that exists, and will be forever the book of record; but in addition it is fascinating, often exciting. It is a very, very good book. Ian Shine, author Thomas Hunt Morgan, Hidden Letters."
2,Not what I expected,I had been using my dad's St Joseph's Sunday Missal for quite a while and I found it to follow the Mass very closely except for a few changes which have been made since the original publication of 1964. It even had the mass in latin on the left hand pages! I expected this missal to be the same just updated with the changes. Boy was I wrong! No latin and the mass isn't as easy to follow as in the older missal. It would have bee nicer if it were leather bound and more compact.
1,This missal is incorrect,"The description says the missal contains the text that will go into effect the first Sunday of Advent 2011. It doesn't. It is copyrighted 1997 and has the old text. I have a pamphlet of the new text and an iPad app with the new readings, so I know what they should be, I will be returning this missal."
2,"good resource, but kindle fail","barnes is worth having & consulting, and would be a four star, but kindle's effort is a fail. index does not work. you can search for an inscrutable ""location"" number from over 1 million, or page through from the beginning....not practical for reference. the kindle effort seems most relevant to pass-time entertainment, not reference. What a drag"
4,batteruy,Good battery for my phone and a lot less expensive. Will purchased one again if I still have the phone.
4,"the history of the study of ""mythology""",This collection of essay written about the study of mythology in the 1950s when the fairly young field of folklore was taking a good hard luck at its own history and development. The theories and ideas espoused in this collection are not to be understood as current trends in folklore and mythic studies but instead help us see how much or how little academic opinions have changed over the past several centuries. As such it is really only a book for the specialist or professional scholar.
5,One of West Coast rap's finest,"WC is tghe man when it comes to rapping and his album is the best oine i've heard in a long while, all his tracks are classics, especially ""The Streets"". I think he should win best rap artist of the decade. Anyone care to disagree, listen to this album."
3,"Good starting point, a little outdated.",From my point of knowledge one of the first to address the issue of CV. Gives a good start for further research and some ideas. CV has from then on (1991) enjoyed a much finer discussion and conceptualization. Needs a new edition with a lot of redesigning.
2,TKA has gotten a TKO with this cd...,"Let me start by saying that these guys were the hottest freestyle group in the latin community NYC, however like they say...everything must come to an end. I feel for TKA we have reached a new generation of music that clashes with theirs. Don't get me wrong, I love TKA in fact I have all of their songs but The greatest hits should had been the last. I don't mean to knock them but its not what it use to be. I actually won tickets to see a Freestyle concert in the Tommy Hilfiger stadium in Long Island in 8/03 and everyone sounded wonderful but I felt sorry for Kayel, His voice was raspy and not great. He might have had a cold or something that day but it was a sad evening because the magic is gone. This cd was ok. I love freestyle and even when he(Kayel) was K7 the music was changing and K7 come baby come cd was the best. It had a hip hop feel to it, then to take a step back with almost freestyle again on this cd is not quite good. Sorry guys."
2,Crashes Computer When Hot,"This product works great in my 17"" Macbook Pro when it is NOT required to perform any labour intensive task. I reguraly work with Pro-tools LE and as a result my Macbook Pro can get quite hot. Using the Expresscard to move audio in and out of the Mac to reduce buss load for Pro-tools actually causes the Macbook to become super overheated. So hot in fact that the Mac simply stops working. The audio stops, the whole screen freezes and the Mac will not respond at all. (I had to remove the battery to reset it as the power button would not respond.) I've never seen such a crash before! So if you are intending to use this card in a Macbook Pro with a program such as Pro-tools LE which is very CPU intensive, I recommend not buying it."
1,Completely useless,"I bought the Belkin F5U514 Firewire 800 ExpressCard to work with a new MacBookPro. The card doesn't connect ANY drive, though a single drive gets enough power to spin up. Total waste of time and money. Stay away from this product. Belkin's customer service is almost more trouble that it's worth. No help there.Best,Erin QLos Angeles, CA"
2,velour ballerina,"they are comfy, but they seem to stick to the tile and make a noise when you walk . they annoy me when i walk"
1,Too small,"I agree with subrosa's review... slippers are too small. None of my shoes are larger than Size 6, and I was replacing a similar pair of Size Small velour ballerina slippers. National's Size Small is fit for children, not adults!"
2,"Not funny, but at least it is annoying.","I will review the first 45 minutes of this drab film because after 45 minutes I gave up on finding any entertainment value. Every character managed to turn my stomach. There's more than one disgusting idiot and they are not the least bit funny. If that is entertaining to you, spend your money.You may ask, Lee since this movie sucked so bad why did you give it two stars instead of one? Well, there were some nice bare tits in the film and that always merits an extra two stars. Now you may ask, but Lee! That would mean a total of three stars not two. Why oh why was a star deducted? That's easy, graphic male homosexual action always results in at least a two star deduction. In this movie, the graphic girl on girl action added back a star resulting in my two star rating."
4,Very Sweet,This movie was a lot sweeter and less raunchy than I expected. We really enjoyed it and so did our 26 year old son.
3,Easy to watch and very enjoyable,"What's it about?A socially inept hippy returns home from jail to find his girlfriend has moved on and he now has to move in with his three sisters, and in the process, unwillingly destroys their lives.Is it any good?The film doesn't have the huge laughs that you would expect with the talent of the cast, but it really doesn't need to. The story itself is clever and delivers a realistic view of relationships. Personally, I was expecting the brother to be a real idiot, like knife-in-the-toaster dumb, but he is actually quite honest and trustworthy, albeit very naive. Definitely worth watching, perhaps even a second time if it's on TV and you're looking for something easy to watch.Best bit?The reunion of two best friends.Did you know?The film had a budget of less than $10 million and was shot for 30 day over a six-week span"
4,a really true to heart comedy/drama/romantic dvd,paul rudd is one of my favorite actors i think he is very talented and he shows that skill in this movie acting as a free bird so to speak (with a great heart)
3,"Funny, but not enough.","A loser brother is released from jail after selling pot to a uniformed police officer. He creates havoc among his siblings and must try to straighten himself out. I like the premise and the cast, but at times I felt the film meandered a bit and I wasn't sure where it was going. It wasn't quite as funny as I had hoped, but it does have its moments. Toward the end it seems to come together a bit, but I was disappointed. This is movie that is not bad, but it's not all that good either."
3,A movie only a Rudd fan would love,"Watching this movie is not a bad way to spend a rainy afternoon, but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again. Many of the moments that were supposed to funny merely made me uncomfortable, and I'm no prude. The plot is also easily predicted. Still, Paul Rudd's inherent charm lifted this movie from ""eh"" to ""all right"". If you're a Rudd fan, then this movie is a must-see."
5,Not a big deal review,Great ensemble! Perhaps there is an idiot cousin in the family (sequel). Brutally honest family members still require love and understanding--unconditionally.
3,"It was an ""ok"" movie.","It was an alright movie, I have definitely seen better. It was worth watching ,but there were several moments in this movie that just made me want to slap some of the characters.I also didn't find this movie to be funny at all.So if you are looking for a comedy I wouldn't choose this movie."
4,Funny movie!,"Worth watching. Funny movie with a good moral. I recommend this movie. Definitely not a ""5"" star movie, but it does deserve 4 stars without a doubt."
5,Kind and fun movie,"Recommend to watch, kind and fun movie about a family of 3 sisters and their brother. Very philosophical about family values."
4,Ironman 112 spin bike,"As an avid cyclist, I wanted something other than a trainer to ride indoors in bad weather. Regular (read: crummy) exercise bikes just don't do it, and are usually flimsy & provide poor posture/positioning on the bike.Not so with this one. I am 6'3"", and not light, so I wanted something substantial that I could hammer on & not worry about anything. After changing the seat (usual crap - just like most outdoor bikes) to something that actually fits human sit bones, I was off. Great adjustability, the handlebars provide many positions, both aero-style & roadie/mountain, and the clip/no clip pedals saved me from having to buy more SPDs.Great workouts, sturdy build, enough chrome & paint so sweat doesn't tarnish/rust every surface after 10 minutes.good stuff. Simple, strong, built to last, and easy to move around. A+.How would I improve it? I couldn't suggest much, w/o making this a $1000+ exercise bike. Go ride."
1,Save your money,CAUTION: Only buy this CD if you are in to cheesy dance music. This is in no way trance/techno. Its merely cheesy dance tunes that have been around for a while. If you are serious about trance music than buy Gatecrasher: Resident Transmission instead. If you are looking for good house than buy Fatboy Slim: Live on Brighton Beach.
2,Too Basic,"If you were new to basic home repair, then this book would be for you. I was disappointed because I thought this book would a lot better. I couldn't find anything in the book that I didn't already know. Shutting off the water supply to the toilet, removing a broken lightbulb and installing a new showerhead are all very, very basic things. If you're ""handy"" around the house, don't bother with this book."
1,"Useless, should have returned it","A quick trip to the Internet will be more useful than this book. It is missing a lot of practical things. Plus, to understand the book, you would already have the rudimentary knowledge it provides. Pass on this one and go to your local home store for help."
4,Just one thing wrong with this...,"Yes. This masterpiece of a collection is everything you could expect and more, what with all of the greatest S-P songs put together on one disk, plus a bonus of other rare gemities. Just one problem though. Does anyone remember the soundtrack from the movie 'Singles'? That's where you can find the original version of 'Drown' and it's much, much, much better there. On 'Rotten Apples' they have cut off several minutes of jamming, wailing and droning instrumentals from this song. I found that to be very disappointing. Maybe I'm being a little too harsh. Maybe not. For that mis-step, 4 stars instead of five. Otherwise, this is a must have."
2,ko..//,"Another pointless compilation. I like the Pumpkins early stuff like ""Gish"" or ""Siamese Dream"", but after ""Mellon Collie.."" they didnt make anything special. ""Adore"" wasnt a bad album but it wasnt a very good album either, and ""Machina..."" I wish they had never released. This compilation only includes two songs from Gish, which is a shame. The songs ""Rhinoceros"" and ""Drown"" has been shortened which I dont like. ""Disarm"" which is, in my opinion, the most aweful song on ""Siamese Dream"" is included while other great songs from that album are absent. There are no songs from ""Pisces Iscariot"" either. I dont see what ""Eye"" and that ""previously unreleased"" song are doing on a best of compilation, none of them is exactly ""best of"" material."
1,GREATIST HITS???????????,"I guess being over played on radio would justify the title 'Hits', but Great? Gimme a break. If these were paintings instead of songs, you'd either find them in the hallways of Doctor's offices or at the swapmeet. This band is very forgettable."
4,One of best greatest hits yet,"Smashing Pumpkins greatest hits is just that their hits from every album. Only thing is I didn't get into them until songs like bullet with butterfly wings, and zero. Which are on here. Their is also their orginal version of Landside. Which everyone knows Dixie Chicks covered not so long ago. For me their are 9 songs I listen to over and over again. It also have disarm which is the killer in me is the killer in you song. Buy this album if you like the band."
1,GREATIST HITS???????????,"I guess being over played on radio would justify the title 'Hits', but Great? Gimme a break. If these were paintings instead of songs, you'd either find them in the hallways of Doctor's offices or at the swapmeet."
4,Buy It While Judas O is still available,"I find myself listening to their actual albums or the Judas O bonus CD far more than this CD. That isn't a knock at Billy Corgan's songwriting ability; he's one of the top few songwriters I've ever heard. Perhaps that's why I find the albums more satisfying, where you can move from the more overtly catchy songs to a hidden gem at the push of a button. Listening to this album makes me wish the Pumpkins had made slightly different choices about what to release as singles. ""By Starlight"" would've been more successful than ""33"". ""I of the Mourning"" from Machina should've definitly been a single. I also don't really like ""Perfect"", maybe ""Tear"" would've been better. . . though alot of people seem to like the former. ""The End is the Beginning is the End"" would have been on here if it weren't for a record label issue w/Warner.Bottom Line: Billy Corgan is an incredible songwriter who's songs never lose their interest. ANYTHING by the Pumpkins is a good buy."
4,fite my terrarium,this thing fits my odd sized terrarium and my ninja snake hasnt escaped yet . i have no complaints about this thing except i guess itd be nice if it had a hinge so i didnt have to take the whole thing off to get to my snake.
5,fits perfectly,"I went to pet shops without luck, finally I decided to go online, I saw a couple that looked like this one but no other vendor in amazon could beat the suppliers price. I did standard shipping and received it in 2 days! Packeging was very neat, secured but yet easy to get out and dispose of. I loved it, it fits just right for my terranium. The lead sorts of locks itself on the rim of the terranium. The only downside is that I must take the heating lamp off the lid to feed my turtles, since it sort of locks itself (has a little of preasure per say) Overall, it was worth getting, useful and a really good material so far! No rust, pain is still on, I have had it for about 4 months now"
4,"""Look What Love"" Is definetly worth the Look!","This compilation album is absolutely awesome! The singers that come together on this do a wonderful job. Jaci Velasquez, Russ Taff, Sixpence, and so many more sing songs that will keep you going for a long time! Michael W. Smith could have made a few contributions to it with some of his wonderful songs, but all in all, this is worth the money!"
4,head flexpoint squash racquet,I was very happy with my purchase of the squash racquet. It was delivered quickly and the packaging protected the racquet. The price was very affordable.
4,Decent,"This album is decent. i would rather listen to 2003 of Wow, since there is way more music. This is a beginning set into the world, yet there is much rock music to be notice."
1,Almost impossible to read,"The author is so mind-numbingly self-absorbed that I find it impossible to identify with her. From the first moment, late in the pregnancy, that they suspect something might not be perfect about their unborn baby, the Stinsons agonize about being deprived of what they want. There is no sense at all, at any point, that they recognize Andrew as a person. It's all about them -- about being in control, about being deferred to, about wanting *their* lives to be as they planned them to be. Andrew, by virtue of his prematurity, throws a monkey wrench into their plans and as such is an obstacle to be overcome, not a child to be loved.Yes, it's frightening and confusing and bewildering to have a baby in a NICU. Only sacrificial love for the child can make the ordeal bearable for a parent. Lacking that capacity, all the author can do is feel sorry for herself. And pity parties make poor reading."
3,Bad Girls of Pulp,"This book is small but amusing. Can fit in a purse orpocket. Illustrations are naughty. The beautiful girls areof the Pin-Up type, all scantily-clad and act like fantasysluts, all promiscuous, all tempting.--- As illustrations,an interesting study of their time era.---- But I think thesmall size of the book works against it. A bigger book wouldhave been better if the people involved wanted it takenseriously. Bigger illustrations are better than smallerillustrations. But I don't regret having bought it. I cansee the effort put into making it. It is a colorful hardcover little book.---- Luisa Felix Review"
3,"Good job on the content, editing and flow need a little work",I am using this book currently in my torts class. The content is solid however the editing is poor. Grammatical errors can be found throughout the text.
1,Jumbo Teacher Stamps,"The stamps were not what I expected. About half of the stamps do not stamp well. One broke the first time I used it (cracked). They do not seem to pick up the ink from the ink pad. I have to re-ink every stamp, annoying when I am stamping student papers 150 at a time."
3,Misprints,"My only complaint about these stamps is that two of them were switched. The label on top said ""Please Do Over"" and the actual stamp said ""Incomplete"" and vice versa. It wasn't a huge deal but kind of annoying after I had already stamped it on a students paper and then had to scribble it out."
2,"Lots of information, but badly presented. Don't bother.","Held obviously knows his stuff -- this book contains a lot of detail on various networking technologies. However, he seems to have a hard time presenting the information in a readable and coherent way. In many sections, if you didn't already know the stuff then reading the book wouldn't make you much wiser. Protocols are discussed in bits scattered over different chapters, making it hard to follow.The book also suffers from terrible graphics, which look like they came out of a dot-matrix printer.In general, the book won't be useful to as a learning tool -- consider it only as a reference."
4,Very nice,This is a great idea. The only disapointment is that it is too short (in content). The photos and scents are lovely and my daughter loves it. They could easily add more content that would allow for disscussion with one's child and more pictures.
5,My son likes it (still),"I bought this book out of curiosity, and I am glad that I did, because my son liked it at first sight, and he still likes it even after a year. The book is really well made - sturdy, not heavy, safe, and of course smells nice. I was worried about the smell being a little bit toxic for a small child, but it did not bother my little one (he was 9 months old). He doesn;t particularly use the book for its smell, but he loves opening each page (I don't know why). The book is so well made that it must be fun for him to try to open and flip the pages. But I only bought this particular one, and I don't plan to buy any other ones... since my son doesn't seem interested in smelling the book."
5,Fun to read out loud!,This is a great book if you have small children. They love it because it's fun to read out loud and it isn't so long that you get out of breath. This is a must have that I enjoy reading over and over again and my little ones never get tired of it.
4,Great story for teaching diversity,This book gave me incredible insight into teaching others what you have not personally experienced. Seeing through the eyes of others. Awesome book!
5,"Vendor excellent, book outstanding","This is a very cute book that very cleaverly brings home the point that a persons experiences color their interpretation of things. The vendor shipped quickly, the product was as advertised"
5,BRAVO,"A MUST see! Single or coupled....you will relate. Brilliant documentary for our times. Not surprisingly, the film captures the challenges of the 'unattached' and the many choices we now have. Something we have long been waiting to see. Great music too..an extra bonus. Once again, BRAVO!"
5,Watch and Learn,"I am a fan of the documentary and this film is both entertaining and enlightening. The film deals with aspects of the single life style here and in the U.K., but gives facts and figures of all relationships. I originally learned of the film watching a morning television show called Mike and Juliette, I am surprised Oprah has not picked up on this theme. I thought the film was really well done, and I loved the sound track, I was particularly impressed with several of the artist; Elza, and Sera BurasI have researched the producers and have not found any other films, was this there first project together, if so I can't wait for more."
5,Raw and dirty,"The ultimate proof The Spice Girls can sing.Before any kind of Photoshop retouch, any diet, make-up or digital voice improvers, this DVD prooves they could already do it back in the early 90's.Live, acapella, harmonies, adlibs, you name it.Even Miss VB proves she's a really good lead-singer...Dirty catfights, lame showcases and shallow lyrics. You gonna LOVE it."
3,flow not slow enough for breast fed baby,"We love the Born Free bottles and have used them since we started supplementing with formula when our daughter was 3 and a half weeks. However, we have found that the flow rate on the level one Born Free nipple is a little too fast for her. They allow her to gulp down a bottle much to quickly and also make her fussy at the breast. She also started spitting up as soon as we started her on bottles even with the Born Free colic inserts. We started using the Avent level one newborn nipples on the Born Free bottles. The Avent nipples are a little stiffer and have a much slower flow rate. She's doing quite well with this combination and tends to take longer to finish up a bottle and she also spits up less now. We're saving the level one nipples that came with the Born Free bottles until she's a little older and completely weaned from breastfeeding."
1,Very bad,These silicone nipples are very bad! do not purchase born free bottles! the bottles and their system are good but the problem is these nipples they are too long so that makes it difficult for the baby to suck.
1,Stay away from M-1 DVDs,"These DVDs are absolutely rip offs. M-1 had some great fights, however you only see the action that was on broadcast TV. Each of these only come with 5 fights and many cut out rounds 1 and 2. The DVD's only hold about 50 minutes of action. I am a big time MMA Fan and these DVDs are just not worth it. HDNET should have bundled the fights together and made compilation DVDs"
1,Terrible!,"As someone lightly versed in harder-edged music, I can say without hyperbole that Winter's Wake by Elvenking is possibly the wrist-limpest attempt as 'extreme' metal this reviewer has ever heard. From the frankly dull vocals to the tepid instrumentation, this album will both bore and embarass anyone with a measure of taste. On the upside, this geekish fairy-legend influenced 'music' will at least serve as preemptive birth control."
3,Add it to the collection if your a fan,"As everyone knows Big Country (BC) broke up in 2000 and as I said previously they are pulling BC albums out from everywhere. This album is no exception, it has the usual favourites like ""In A Big Country"", ""Fields Of Fire"", ""Wonderland"", ""Look Away"", ""One Great Thing"" and a few other minor songs like ""East Of Eden"", ""Just a Shadow"", ""Save Me"". It's a collection of 11 songs, which I really think they could have put a better collection on. My favourite on the album is the ""The Teacher"". This album, if your not a fan, I would give it a miss, but if your like me get it to add to your collection. I really believe that the record companies should let BC RIP and get on with other things."
5,Mighty Bright XtraFlex,We use this product as a reading light at night. I provides plenty of light for the book's pages yet it does not disturb my spouse's sleep while I am reading. It does exactly what I hoped it would do.
4,lovely folk,"great stuff, my wife loved this band and after listening i was also pulled in- great for relaxing with friends and enjoying a few drinks."
1,THIS IS A BAD MOVIE,jennifer Lopez should stick to singing because this movie she directed is aweful and boring the previews make you think its all about dancing but its not there is like maybe 3 parts of dancing in it it is a waste of time to even watch it
5,Family Favorite,"I bought this book several years ago after seeing it featured in a magazine. At the time, we had 8 children at home....now, my older children who are out on their own, ask me to copy the recipes for them! We found things that were easy to make, even for the kids on their own, cost little, and tasted great."
2,Baked potatoes and oatmeal?,"I thought that the amount of information given in this book did not justify the price. I found the Tightwad Gazette books and especially Miserly Moms to be better values. I was disappointed to see recipes for baked potatoes, oatmeal and french toast. These recipes are so fundamental, I couldn't believe that they were included (you can always read the directions on the oatmeal container).In addition, if the type on the introduction wasn't so large, the intro probably would have taken up only 10 pages. It seemed as though they were trying to take up space to generate more pages.I use many of the recipes in this book and they are very good. If this book cost closer to $10, I would give it 3 or 4 stars, I simply think it is overpriced for the info you get. Considering that the book was written for an audience that is trying to save money, it is a shame that it doesn't deliver more."
4,SmartFrench decent for listening comprehension,"I had French in high school and wanted to brush up for a trip to France. The conversations are good for trying to bring you up to speed on listening comprehension, but they are probably only useful for someone who has had some French before. I was hoping for authentic speed and pronunciation and this is definitely it. Most people will also need an additional grammar book or introductory text."
4,Modern melodic rock!,"Great album from Waltham. Very well-produced pop-rock music with nice vocals over a solid wall of guitars. The vocals are catchy and the song-writing is cool although not revolutionary. These guys sound alot like Rick Sprinfield. Each song has a happy groove with lyrics basically about a guy's tragic love life revolving around a girl. In fact most of the songs are named after the girl in the song!! Overall, Waltham are a good sounding tight outfit that will appeal to fans of quality melodic rock."
5,...Actually 6 Stars If I Could...,"Short and sweet, Waltham is a rare mix of melodic rock, power pop and crunchy guitars all with more hooks than a tackle box. The ultimate air guitar and/or road trip disc. Awesome."
2,Yawn...,"I tried to like this book, but it was just so boring. There was no...life in it. No passion. It was just so flat."
3,Well Written But Really Boring.,I usually can read a book in 1 or 2 days getting so caught up in the story but it took me a week to read this book. It was so boring. Finally toward the end I just started skipping sections. I am much more into fast paced fun reads - that make me stay up all night - not wanting to put the book down. This one bored me to sleep.
2,not worth it,"I enjoyed Chase's ""The English Witch"", but ""Miss Wonderful"" isn't. Too crude and not enough character development. Glad I got it from the library instead of wasting money."
3,Blandurama,"Like a previous poster, I was waiting with bated breath for this album. After Boatman's Call and No More Shall We Part, I had great expectations for Cave and his deeply meaningful lyrics. What's missing in this offering are the deeply meaningful lyrics.Musically, this piece is a step back towards Murder Ballads instead of a progression forward. Some of the songs, like ""There is a Town"" and ""Still in Love"" are gorgeous, musically, but lack the lyrical resiliance of other songs like ""Love Letter"", ""Are You the One..."", and ""Gates to the Garden.""They lyrics in Nocturama simply aren't as passionate or meaningufl. Songs from both Boatman's and NMSWP stick with me in class and work but from this album, not so.New and long-time Cave fans will enjoy this album, but not in the same highly rewarding way you likely enjoyed his last two."
3,i dont know maybe i wanted more,"ok im not a super huge Nich Cave fan ive really only listented to him since Red Right Hand was in Dumb and Dumber but i loved boatmans call and no more shall we part, so i was really looking forward to this album. i dont know i dont really like any of the songs although im sure a few may grow on me <unlike No more shall we part which i loved from track one> the only thing that i can see making Nick extremly famous is the DVD 9 minutes or so into babe im on fire the lines ""the nervous stewardess"" and the ""hijacker""..with an image on the DVD of a plane taking a nose dive. i can see this getting a lot of PC freaks on the phones pulling the dvd off the market. maybe just maybe im reading to much into this (i doubt it) but with the dvd having some strange images anyway it really sticks out in the terror world we live in but on a whole its a decent album and dvd."
2,Oh Dear,"I've been a Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds fan since I first heard Tender Prey about 12 years ago and have seen them play all over the world, I've loved everything they've done. Up till now. This is the worst album Cave has ever realsed. With the exception of the first four songs everything else sounds lazy, half-assed and (dare I say it) dull. Tired lyrics, all of which I've heard before on previous albums, and a complete lack of heart and conviction too, which is almost criminal."
4,Smoothly pummeled,"Nick Cave and friends play with so much passion and raw energy, spinning edgy, heartful tales that profoundly move moods and often get the feet tapping, as well.The heart, mind and soul are delightfully pummeled then soothed by the wondrous music of this gaunt white duke. He always strikes an overall balance between mysteriously dark and brooding WHILE beautiful and hopeful.That unmistakable rich baritone matches such deep lyrical content. I'm perplexed by the genius of one who moves so smoothly between tales of ultimate love and the romance of death and even murder. It's like a vicarious trip into a variety of delectable and despicable vices with an often safe return.Though his stance of drunkenness and obsession with murder fantasies make me want to push him over, I'll still be listening as he falls...He's still such a force to be reckoned with; that's for sure."
5,I'm on Fire!,"I discovered Nick Cave in highschool through his appearance in ""Wings of Desire"". Now, eleven years later I am still hopelessly in love with his music. ""Nocturama"" is incredible. A little more ""rock'n'roll"" than ""No More Shall We Part"", a little less somber than ""Boatman's Call"". This album is full of everything I love about Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, sweet ballads, chaotic rants, wry humor and of course, deeply moving, heartfelt love songs.""Bring it On"" and ""Babe I'm On Fire"" were my favorite tracks but the whole CD is poetry, a perfect blending of Cave's old and new styles.All and all ""Nocturama"" is amazing, absolutely not to be missed."
2,One of his weaker albums,"This is Nick Cave treading water. Yes, there are some beautiful ballads and a few rocking numbers, but there's nothing here he hasn't done better before. ""Babe I'm on Fire"" is a blast, but other than that there isn't anything on this album that stays with me. This one is for obsessives only, everyone else is better off with ""Henry's Dream"", ""Let Love In"", or ""Your Funeral My Trial""."
2,A real disappointment!,"Nick Cave had some of the greatest albums of the last ten years. Then this. Wonderful Life is quite good and He Wants You is fine. However, my problems come with the ""rock"" songs. Bring It On is completely uninspired as is Right Out of Your Hand. My biggest qualm is with the (and I can't believe I'm saying this for any Nick Cave song) truly horrible ""Babe, I'm on Fire"". 17 minutes of the same verses. This is the only 17 minute song that probably took 17 minutes to write. My feeling on this CD is that someone told him to try and mix the new sound of his prior, truly wonderful recordings with his old sound. This mixture leads to a bunch of poorly written songs that seem quite forced. However, every artist has a bad album here and there. Note: The DVD video of ""Babe I'm on Fire"" is kind of silly and fun but the song is just so so bad."
2,Similes,"All my adult life, I've studied Emily Dickinson and also tracked the career of our poet here. Sometimes cryptic, casual, and terse, often without personal boundaries and in the readers face with name-dropping liaisons and hippie-style peace and love and brotherhood, slightly entertaining with her free verse within Cold Comfort, Lyn Lifshin is no Emily Dickinson."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this for my grandson for a small ""congratulations for making the district band."" From the picture I assumed he would get one of the great colors. Wrong! All it is is a white piece that glows in the Dark - absolutely no color. Very very disappointed."
5,Very good movie!,"This is truely a great movie, especially if you love horses! But even my daughter's grandparents enjoyed watching this one! I think that the price right now is too much but if you can be patient and wait for the price to come down....definately get this one for your video library!!"
5,Mountain Consumer,"I really miss this mascara as Clinique isn't carrying it anymore and their replacement mascara doesn't seem to give you the longer, separated lashes."
2,Completely Disappointed,"I had to choose a book to review for a conservation class, since none of them were in stock in any bookstore I took an random chance ordering this one. I realize now that I made a bad decision. Pyne jumps all over the place in his writing, there is no clear linear track to the chapters while discussions jump from prehistoric people to European colonization. I understand the basics of what he is trying to say, that fire has been an integral part of the world for the past 500 million years but he does it in such a convoluted way that I honestly can't recommend this book to anyone."
3,ok camera,some amazing pictures! Others not so good. I could not see the picture I was taking when in the sun or underwater. For the price it takes good pictures. Keep in mind though it does NOT come with a memory card which I bought one on sale for 14.00. That is an additional cost. The camera is small and compact. For my need it worked well and took some on land and underwater photos on our trip. P.S. stock up on triple a batteries. It sure beats a disposable underwater camera.
4,Not bad at all,"This camera isn't top notch, but it certainly isn't bad. It doesn't have many features like a good lens or good pictures while moving, but if you can stay still enough, it'll be a great photo to share with family and friends. Also, most people don't change the settings on it. Mine took crappy pics at first, but when I changed certain setting on it, the pics now look amazing. I also filmed under water with it, both at the beach and in a pool. You need to get really close if the water isn't very clear, but you can definitely get good pics for a small price. If you're broke, but want a fun camera to carry around to all your favorite places (especially the outdoors) then go ahead and purchase this one. Also, I had no leaks or anything with the case; it's great and sturdy. AND IT FLOATS, so you won't lose it underwater. It's a tough cam."
3,Lynch Mob Live Revolution,"I've been a George Lynch fan since the Dokken days of the mid 80s. The CD recording is great on this, but on the DVD the vocal and guitar tracks are dubbed in. It sounds like the same recording for the CD so what you're really getting is a live CD and DVD where the vocals and guitar were recorded in a studio. The lighting is bad on the DVD, so there are no real good shots of George's guitar solos. And the brief ones that you can catch actually display the fact that his fingers are playing something different than what you are hearing. So if you're looking for a great live DVD, you're not going to get it here. If you want some great re-recorded studio versions of these songs, you will like this."
5,For Love of Wendy,"I love this book because every character introduced to the reader is explored. Melody Hunter and Jason Wakefield know each other very, possibly too, well. Melody comes into her own when her brother asks her to dee-jay for him one night and she uses the pseudonym Wendy Wyoming. Jason finally notices her while trying to discover who Wendy Wyoming is."
4,Studies in Flood Geology,"This book consists of a compilation of Woodmorappe's papers published in various journals during the past couple of decades. They may be some of the most important papers published in geology during that period. While most geologists have been forced to abandon doctrinaire uniformitarianism, few have questioned the underlying assumptions of such matters as fossil succession and the geologic column, for example, at least to the extent of Woodmorappe's penetrating analysis. Both evolutionists and creationists need to be cognizant of the issues Woodmorappe raises."
5,Intrigue and espionage,This book was great! The character reminded me of James Bond and Dirk Pitt rolled into one-lots of excitement and intrigue. But what I also liked was the history-it was interesting reading the background to events that took place in WWII. I plan to read it again!
1,Unprofessional spy novel,"I cannot believe the author is a professional writer. Trite, oversimplified action, childlike dialog. I seldom don't give up on a book, but did so on this one after 1 - 2 chapters."
5,Easy reading but profound,"This book is one I really want to recommend. It reads easy, yet it's profound. It is NOT one of those books that tell you that forgiving is easy, loving is easy, truthfulness is easy, even DYING is easy -- that kind of thing. The stories in this book are about people who forgave after tremendous struggles. It makes a lot of sense and gives me lots to think about. Arnold writes that forgiveness could change the world, and I think he's right."
2,Distinctively Susan Grant,"If you're a fan of Susan Grant, you'll enjoy this stand-alone novel; if you are not already a fan, however, you may find it lacking. It has many elements that are distinctive to her work (the heroine is a single mother and a pilot, the hero is a battle scarred soldier). I thought some of the characterization was lacking, and some of the plot developments needed more fleshing. I found this story so-so, and not as good as the Borderlands and the Star series by Grant--were it a series, I would not continue reading it. I will, however, continue reading this author."
5,The PERFECT pop punk soundtrack,"In 16 songs ALLISTER have created the perfect pop-punk album of the year. Somewhere (perhaps on Fullerton?) while criss-crossing the country over the last few years on their relentless touring schedule Allister have learned to write great songs, sing the ferocious hooks and play their instruments like bona fide hitmakers. The second song Radio Player has got to be the catchiest single not (yet) on radio. Other gems are ""overrated"" (apparently about a record company), the one that got away (about a girl -- surprise, surprise -- after all this is an Allister album), and supercatchy ""flypaper"". This album is superb from the first listen and keeps growing. I play it for friends and they say ""WOW"" how come I haven't heard of these guys this is GREAT! For better or worse, this is the next big thing. If you like Blink, NFG, Good Charlotte, YOU'LL LOVE ALLISTER. listen to the samples and judge for yourself and then pick up a copy and start singing along with the rest of us."
5,glorious,"This is the stuff. I always had thought that no-one could touch Leontyne Price - until I heard this. It's different of course but Gencer conveys such frailty and her 4th act is epic. This is a studio recording of the RAI film 1957. Del Monaco is his usual self - explosive and unsubtle - but great. Barbieri demonstrates why she is still considered to ""the"" Azucena and Bastianini is broody and delivers. There is a libretto but no english translation and the added bonus are highlights from La Forza in Koln of the same year - again incredible! Gencer really is the star here."
4,Not as Strong as the First Season,"The first season was more compelling. It had a greater degree of realism (relative to this one), a greater sense of urgency, and it was new. Here, the same characters go through the same kind of motions we're used to, including a strong factor of shock value being written into most episodes.It'll still hold your interest, and the cast are again excellent. But the show starts to move at this point towards being a strange soap opera full of sadism, rather then being something like the first season where you really sensed that anything could happen. And whereas the first season ended brilliantly, it really whimpers here."
5,Amazing,Every season gets better and better with more actors that we all know and love. This is an amazing show!!
4,Realistic depiction of Brazilian life,"Having spent my ""formative"" years in Brazil, I have to say this movie tugs at my ""coracao""(heart).I would LOVE to see more work (movies) from this talented director. I hope ""Macabea"" has finally attained her ""felicidade"" that was denied her for so long. Truely ""um grande cultivar"" (a great work)! Muito obrigado!"
4,Good introduction to items in a Catholic Church,"The author very accurately describes the items in the Church as well as their relevance to worship. Very good for young children. There is one glaring error however, near the end the children are pictured genuflecting; unfortunately it has them on the left knee instead of the right. Otherwise an excellent resource."
1,"A revision to ""Oh My God""","Having discovered this on the Apple Store while searching for a favorite song of mine, ""Someone Else's Story"", I originally slapped a bad review on this album. I was unaware that this track was NOT recorded by Ms. Milano, but one of her younger students. Therefore, while I still maintain that this track should be buried deep in the cold ground where it won't hurt anyone anymore, the rest of the album is undeserving of a one star review. She has a fine voice. My appologies to Ms. Milano, with the caveat to better label and title material with your name on it, and be more selective about which students you showcase.And let me guess WHICH two people didn't find my original review ""helpful""... I thought she was grateful for having this error pointed out."
1,Memenographed,For those you that remember life before laser copiers will like this book. (Nor really). It is unreadable. The typeface is awful and the ink on paper is blotchy. You can download the PDF for free from Eastern Carolina University. Download is free and condition excellent.
5,Excellent Approach,Excellent Approach. A practical book to grasp the nuances of American Pronunciation. Very intersting too. I wish the publisher provides a CD instead of tape.
5,Must read for independent investors!,"I love this book. It is simple and straightforward. If you would have used this book in the past few years you would have done very well in your investing. Believe me I know. Who was talking about gold five years ago? This guy is the real deal with the pedigree to prove it and he shares his knowledge with the little guy. I picked his book up many years ago in a thrift store and I have been following it ever since. I wish he would print a new edition, I would like to here his opinion on ETFs and diversification."
3,rowenta Pressure Iron and Steamer,"I like the steam that the iron puts out, but if not careful, you will get lots of water marks. I also think that for the price of this iron it should have included a water level so that you can see with the water gets low. I also do not like the amount of time you have to wait for the iron to be ready (7 minutes or more). Not having to fill the tank so much is a plus when you have a lot of ironing to do. When using the right amount of steam it does a great job."
1,Don't Buy It!,"We have owned this iron for about a year; bought it from Amazon. When it worked, it was great, especially for doing lots of ironing at once. But, it has had a chronic leaking problem, with water seeming to end up on the floor right under where I am ironing so I invariably dragged a just ironed sleeve through a puddle of water. Lack of tank gauge window was not a big deal, and you needed to keep it full for good results. However, today the switch went out and it is dead. Horrible product!"
4,"Great iron, only gripe is the auto-off switch","The iron does a great job, easy to use, reliable. After about two years of extensive use, I have not encountered the problems about which others have written. the auto-off switch is a nuisance and I am going to hard wire the switch. The iron is never left on when not in use, so the auto off has not value to me.I would not hesitate to recommend the iron to others."
5,"Intense, Memorable","Intense, memorable soundtrack. I had no idea this common tune had originated from a contemporary film. In specific regards to ""Lara's Theme"", it's instantly memorable. Really stuck in my mind after I finished viewing the film.Classic scores, classic alumn."
5,I bought a signed edition of this book,"The author is clear, concise and detailed in his writing of this book.His Hung Gar knowledge is excellent. He explains the Lineage, Hung Gar Basics, Application of movement and concepts of Forms. He also briefly reviews treating training injuries with Dit Da Jow and massage.I have trained in Hung Gar for 3 years and his videotapes are good also."
3,"If it were not for the original theme, I would have fallen asleep.","It will remind you of Big (Tom Hanks) but I'm sure they don't want people thinking that so they switch up the storyline a bit, move it back 50 + years which allows for wardrobe that can Robert Redfordize Brad Pitt...I'm sure Hollywood wants to do that whenever they get the chance.More along the lines of a chic flick, it was not as entertaining as it could have been if Benjamin was a bit more mischievious as he's been known to be in other movies. It's one of those movies where the dialog drops to faint whispers so you have to crank up the volume all the way and get blown out of your seat when the scene changes to blasting music. Okay Netflix, it's time to take down the pop-up ads for this movie that somehow creeps it's way past the pop-up blocker on every single website we've visited for the past 6 months!"
1,Where to start with how bad this movie is?,Here are bullets of why it is bad:* Way too long* Boring characters* Horrible acting* Did not adequately develop the aging backwards thing
3,Curious choice of filming in Shadows,"This is an adapted screen play, not a faithful following of the original F.Scott Fitzgerald, but that is not the criticism. The story line is true, simply updated to contemporary times. Pitt and Blanchett are both quite good in their roles. The criticism I have with the film is in the directing. Several of the scenes are shot in shadows or half light which make it difficult to see all the details. Certainly this was a conscious choice by the director - but why? Same criticism with the dialogue - too much of it was spoken in soft tones and mumbling, which made it difficult for me to understand. I don't believe that the problem I've noted is me, as my eyesight is 20/20, I don't wear glasses and I have no problem with my hearing. It seems to be the way the director chose to make the film."
4,Interesting... 3.5 stars,"Brad Pitt plays Benjamin Button, a man born old who ages backwards as the years pass, so that when he dies, he's an infant. Cate Blanchett is his love interest but there didn't seem to be much chemistry between the two. I also didn't like her character - she seemed too self-absorbed. I guess I thought this would be along the lines of Forest Gump, showing historical events that coincided with Button's life, and it does this only in a minor way. Pitt does a good job with the role and his narrative adds dimension. Tilda Swinton is fabulous and carries this movie. The ending is, of course, a sad one, so beware."
2,MORK FROM ORK,"Mork was from a planet where people were born old and got younger as they aged. This tv series,starring Robin Williams, was basically the story line for this movie. It's sort of like watching a Burger King commercial and then rushing out to buy the lucious burger pictured on tv. The disappointment with both is palpable."
1,Terrible,"The worst movie I have seen in a long time, it was painfully bad. After investing 45 minutes of my life on this movie I continued to watch just in hope of something worthwhile happening but it never did."
3,ok not great,"This is a paradox: great actors, beautiful cinematography, original stroryline but somehow it does not gel and become a great movie. Indeed the central premise of the movie, a man aging backwards simply makes the whole thing too weird with its realistic tone. It is also extremely slow moving in an unnecessary way. Simply because time is limitless does not mean that a movie can go on forever. It is still beautiful to watch but kind of boring, which was maybe the idea also."
2,Ehhhhh.,"One of Fincher's most disappointing films by far. Not nearly as bad as the vacant and horribly acted Panic Room but it's not much more interesting. I don't know what to say. Bored out of my mind. This film has nothing to say. I wouldn't call it completely awful but there is simply not much here to see that has not been done before and much better at that. Confusing themes, direction, and most of all a script that goes nowhere. Near the end I was about to turn the thing off."
2,Bored to tears!,"I am sorry Brad Pitt, but this was wholy dissapointing. I guess if you look at the acting, I woudl say it was a good movie, but when you look at everything, it just bored. The story was interesting and worth-while, BUT there was no climax and no excitement. I guess nto every movie needs a giagntic fireworks and bombs climax, but really? I felt like I was watchign a doctor try to revive a dead patient....it just wasn't happening. All in all this movie realllllly failed to impress me."
2,She ruins it,"This is not the typical movie I like to watch, but a friend of mine said it reminded him of Forrest Gump so I decided to check it out. The storyline is about a man being born as an old man who ages backwards as people around him get older. I did see a few similarities with Gump, like when Benjamin goes off adventuring and major events are happening around him. There is a good cast of characters and Pitt delivers his normal better than average performance, but what kills this movie is the female lead actress. She comes across as cold, selfish, and unloving and she wasn't the best thing to look at either which might of made her tolerable. Since this movie is, at the bottom of it all, a love story, it's hard to like it if you don't like the girl."
4,Good Movie!,"I like this movie very much. It's such a different kind of story about a man aging backwards and the special effects are fabulous. Brad Pitt does a really good job as Benjamin Button and Kate Blanchet is wonderful in her role as well. This movie will (at least it did with me) remind you a little along the line of Forrest Grump. It's funny, sad, and tender."
3,I was bored . . .,"I bought this movie at my wifes urging. She told me about the concept (someone born old and getting younger over a lifetime and dying as a baby) and said, from the parts of the movie shes seen, she thought it was a wonderful movie. I found it mind numbingly boring. Somehow, they managed to turn a short story (as originally written) into a slow, plodding movie that drones on for about three hours. I understand that it was up for a bizillion awards and so on. . . good for them. I thought the second dvd with the ""how they did stuff"" was FAR more interesting than the movie. I think most guys would feel the same way I do about it - a real cure for insomnia. The wife LOVED it though. By the way . . . I gave it 3 stars BECAUSE the wife loved it. Had it been only MY opinion, it would have gotten less than one (if that were possible)."
2,man y,If you are a gorehound like me do not get this movie if you want it for a plot then it is different but each person the clown kills you dont get to see him do it right when the clown goes to kill someone it goes right to another part so this movie suck man I have ordered so many horror movies and I still can not find a good horror movie that does not use the comp for all the blood and guts the last good movie I have found is carver and if you want a good clown movies with awesome gore watch 100 tears thanks Mandy Ps if your ganna make a killer horror movie show the kill and use someimagination da da du du
3,kansas mom,"Didn't like the way the manufacturer just put the sticker on every item. I'm expecting better quality from disney product. For $20, it's not worth it!"
5,practical and useful for any course with written work,"This thin volume has been my trusty companion through many courses over the last few years. I bought it originally to help with writing assignments for an evening class, and have referred back to it for every essay-assessed course since.It is full of clearly-expressed advice on topics such as research and background reading, note-taking, planning, drafting and re-drafting, and editing your work. It also has plenty of examples of written work, with comments and suggestions for improvements. The book seems to be aimed mainly at university students, but is still extremely useful in a school or college context, as more and more qualifications use assessed written work rather than an exam at the end of the course.This book certainly helped improve my writing, and I'm pretty sure it has improved my grades. Best of all, it will still be useful if you take another course."
2,Too tough,"I hardly got anything out of this book. Understanding pointers was difficult, and the brief explanations weren't helpful. I can't imagine how someone else would learn C.If you want to learn C with good programming practise, skill and techniques, get Teach youself C in 21 days. You'll have a better time."
4,Does its job... but no more,"I am a seasoned VB programmer who was thinking of learning some other, more low level languages for my personal interest. I purchased this book since I wanted to quickly get an introduction to C before exploring it more thouroughly. I am about halfway through this book and am quite pleased. It clearly explains the concepts covered and has very demonstrative examples. I found the excercises at the end to be a little too easy unfortunatly. The answers were generally only 10-20 lines long. They each seemed to cover one point and one point only. This is what I believe is the main problem with the book. It does not tie concepts together very well.On the whole a good book, teaches the syntax but much more is needed to gain more than a rudamentary understanding of the language."
4,Educators must read,"This book shares important information in a warm and personal, yet very professional style about the importance of the movement of the hand and the development of the human brain. It would be good for every educator and everyone who legislates about education to be required to read this book."
5,AFRICANS IN AMERICA!,"Originally produced for PBS in 1998, this DVD includes all four installments of this POWERFUL DOCUMENTARY! The focus here is on SLAVERY IN AMERICA, starting with JAMESTOWN in 1607 and ending with the start of the CIVIL WAR in 1861! This documentary combines FIRST-PERSON ACCOUNTS and HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS with INTERVIEWS with not only historians but the descendants of those slaves! This might be the FINEST look at America's PECULIAR INSTITUTION available on DVD!"
2,Disappointed,"I thought Callas was supposed to be a great singer. I found her performance, boring, and acting unconvincing, her voice unattractive, and her appearance homely.Another disappointment is Sutherland in the Lucia item. She was out of tune and looked bored.All is not lost however. Corelli is sublime is his two selection, and may I say handsome as anyone I've ever seen.Price's Vissi D'arte far better than Callas's.That's my opionion, take it or leave it."
4,Ed Sullivan Show 2: Great Moments in Opera [VHS],"Great Moments in Opera: Treasures From Ed Sullivan [VHS]The audio and the video are excellent for that vintage. Much better than the ""Voice of Firestone"" similars. Unlike them, also, these are in color.The VHS is an excellent alternative to the terribly high-priced dvds."
1,"TOO MUCH LOVE, IT'S SICKENING!","I watched this movie just to see what it was about and I felt that it took too long to get to the point. There are many other JHorror filmz that out beat this trilogy, like wise. The beginning of it took 30 mins or so to pin point the wedded couple's relationship. I mean, they were so lovie dovie that it made me want to vomit...which is sad! It's sad because usually a viewer would want to puke after watching a grousome/blood slashing scene. Indeed it has only one spellbounding-death scene that caught my eye (The part where the con-man gets chopped in half by a falling sheet of window glass for a newly constructed office building w/in the city) and that's it. I'm sorry, but I just hated the storyline of the whole feature all together."
1,buy if for less,I bought this book and paid a premium because I was under the impression it was a rare book - I got a white covered paperback book - that was of average construction and found elsewhere for [cheap] - do not - I repeat - do not get ripped off paying more for this book
1,The 9's? More Like 0's,"It's shockingly bad, and I liked the promise of earlier works of John August. Don't keep waiting for it to get better. It gets much worse. ""0"" should be a review rating, so folks are warned not to waste precious minutes from their lives....."
1,Swan Lake (Matthew Bourne),"Please, save yourself the money and bother. This is a very misguided production. I can only blame myself because I didn't read the description carefully. It appears that Mr(?)Bourne is hoping to normalize some abnormal behavior by blaming it on abnormal behavior, which he must consider normal. Follow that? Is this an autobiographical piece? If my only gripe were the ridiculous content I would keep quiet, assuming that maybe I'm just a prude. But fluffy pantaloons on sweaty bare-chested BIRDS! Oh, please. And the choreography looked like a lame effort at West Side Story meets Swan Lake. My adult children and I sat and laughed until we cried--skipping ahead when we were completely disgusted, of course. Stick to playing gigs at pubs, Mr. Bourne. I ordered another version."
3,Good-but not the best,"I was instantly attracted by this camera: nice size, look and what the heck 160 dollars for a 6 million pixel camera! Like most I read reviews on it and realised that most weren't happy with it at all, but I bought it anyways. And guess what? I have very few regrets about my choice. There are a lot a different ''tools'': turn of flash, change the quality of the picture, video... only problem: the pace ! You can't be in a hurry to take a picture or get your ''kodak moment'' because you're gonna have to wait about 10 seconds after you turn it on to be able to use it and 5 seconds between each shot.Bottom line: good for small events or parties but don't take this to a wedding: you're gonna miss every opportunity to take a picture because you'll be waiting for the darn thing to turn on"
5,Good story -- rather politically incorrect,"Others have covered the plot, the setting and so forth. What I thought noteworthy was the extent of ""political incorrectness."" Muslim terrorits are routinely referred to as ""ragheads"" Black terrorist supporters in Phila are referred to as ""AAL"" which is short for ""Afro American Lunatics"" There is one section that expounds on the history of the Koran and makes a case for the Mullahs having set back civilization in the Muslim world by about 500 years. More importantly that the Mullahs don't want to take any responsibilty so they blame the Western World which is at the root of terrorism.I was surprised to read all this stuff from Griffin. I've read everthing of his and this is the first time I can remember this sort of writing style. Quite refreshing..."
3,My First Book By Griffin,"While I enjoyed the story of this book, the lack of action and constant long flashback scenes kind of make this book drag along. I only got this one because I wanted to read The Hostage and this is the first book in the series."
2,Glad I only bought the paperback,"I seem to recall reading one of Griffin's books years ago and enjoying it. Not so with this one- the numerous flashbacks laboriously detailing the hero's childhood just wear you out. Griffin supposedly is plugged in to the military community; I work with military folks every day and they just don't talk like these characters. The references to ""ragheads"" are more like the Gulf War-era Army. And a Special Forces major who speaks seven languages ? And is checked out on Hueys ? And can fly a Cessna ? Puh-leeze !"
1,Continuously Offensive Dialogue,"It was very difficult to enjoy because of the offensive dialogue. Don't get me wrong...I'm an adult man who hears plenty of vulgarities.But Mr. Griffin has an obsession with having virtually every character repeatedly say ""Jesus!"", or ""Jesus Christ!"", or ""God damn.."". And he tries to make a preemptive attack at anyone who objects to this by having one character respond to such an outburst with an effeminate lispy ""are you going to stand there blaspheming..."". Mr. Griffin tries to paint anyone who may take offense and complain as weak or weak wristed.Mr. Griffin clearly knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is grossly offensive to Christians, but he deliberately repeats such dialogue over and over and over and over. Every character does it repeatedly (probably over 100 times in the book), to the point where it is obvious Mr. Griffin isn't using it for individual characterization. It is clear he wants it to be ""in your face"" to any Christian who may read his book."
1,Weak,"I found this very dull.The main issues I had were that the plot is weak and the characters are not compelling enough to let you forgive this.We are told how impressive the hero, Charley Castillo, is, but we don't see any evidence.He is supposed to be a Special Forces/ Delta Force major in his mid-30's, in the top 5% of officers but seems to act like an immature 20 year old, with no nous whatsoever.He doesn't seem very tough or bright and demonstates extremely poor judgment (getting drunk repeatedly, including when he knows he is about to enter a very dangerous situation. Not drinking from angst, just stupidity)The plot meanders through various petty bureaucratic encounters, with no excitement until the end. It just had no visceral appeal at all.I guess I was spoiled by shows like ""The Unit"" in which the characters are impressive, but this left me cold. One would be better off reading ""Point of Impact"" by Stephen Hunter which has a much better plot and hero."
5,Peaceful yet inspiring piano music.,Jon Dahlander's piano music is some of the best I have ever heard. It is peaceful. It is complex. It is worth every penny you will pay for it.
1,DO NOT buy a Whisperkool,"I currently have a 4200 Whisperkool unit manufactured by Vinotheque. Please let me assist you in your purchase decision... DO NOT BUY this company's products. The Whisperkool units are not reliable, the design of the product requires that any servicing of the unit necessitates completely removing the unit from the wall that it has been installed in.There is no easy access for repair, ultimately requiring your contractor to come and remove it prior to a technician being able to work on it.Further, the company's customer support is non existent. ""Leave a message and we'll call you back""! Do yourself a favor, buy something else. When I had a serious problem with this product, the company passed the buck and said it wasn't their concern. If your cellar design/contractor is recommending this product... I'd seriously question whether you have the right contractor for your job!"
1,2 year lifespan,"I have had a whisperkool unit for 2 years and it just died. All of my other units, made by various manufacturers have lasted for 5 -7 years. I won't buy another."
4,A must read for any Chase fan,"One of her better books, this is a must read. If you like Chase then you will love this book. And if you have not read anything By Loretta Chase before, hen this is a great book to start with. I have read just about everything Chase has written, and those that I have not yet read, I ahve on my bookshelf waiting for me."
4,Two thumbs up!,"Oh, that Rupert Carsington! I could just eat him up with a spoon. He is by no means the all brawn/no brain brother that the rest of his family deems him. He's big-hearted and fun-loving and a perfect match for the heroine, Daphne, who is cerebral and serious (without being one of those shrill and preachy bluestocking characters). They really complement eachother. I would have loved to have seen more of their romance, too, as another reviewer noted. But what we did see was very well-done."
5,It's been a long time since I couldn't put a book down.,"This is the third book I've read from Loretta Chase and it was really fabulous. I read it into the night because I simply had to know the ending. I loved thus book. It's sexy, exciting and full of fun. I laughed out loud and enjoyed each page"
5,REVENGE THE SERIES,This is a fantastic mystery/action show. Can't wait to see what mischief the characters get into next week! Let me bow to Queen Victoria!
1,Revenge season 2,"We like to watch, Revenge, the Amazon direct streaming is TOTALLY INFERIOR AND SUBSTANDARD. The sound is so low that I need to buy an amplifier just to hear it. We have 1320 Kbts way more than most people. Your streaming is very bad. Sometimes we loose picture as your streaming KBTS goes down whem more people log on. YOU NEED TO FIX YOUR SITE. WE HAVE NET FLIX which is totally perfect and work flawlessly. Whoever is incharge of your steaming needs to go back to school and learn the trade YOU RATE A VERY VERY VERY POOR"
5,Amazing plot or shall I say plotting.,This show has been nicely put together. Just when you think it's going to be okay something else happens. We love watching the season unfold. There is so much betrayal; it's hard to even see half of it coming. The plot is about a young woman who wants revenge for the atrocities that were made against her father. She wants nothing more than revenge. Sometimes she has a heart but that just gets in the way. The other characters are mostly just awful people getting what they deserve. She is good! Her best friend is quirky and has a great character as well.
5,Good show!,This show was awesome! It was so convenient to purchase the episodes I needed and the quality was amazing! I will definitely use amazon again to watch my favorite shows!
5,Great SHOW!!!,Enjoy the twists and turns!!! Fun show to watch!! Got addicted last season and had to continue to this season!!
5,Love this show,Only way to watch a show is without commercials! Hooked on this show and did not want to miss out on any of the action.
4,Awesome TV series,this show is by far one of the best with all of its twists and turns. Love all of the drama and backstabbing that goes on!
4,affordable ecommerce,"i ordered the software last month and so far i'm happy with my purchase. i didn't need a high-tech ecommerce solution, just something that was easy to use and affordable and i have no major complaints about the software. my product line changes often so its very convenient to be able to change my products with a few clicks. the templates are nice looking. i'd reccommend this software to any body who needs a quality shopping cart and does not have enough money to get a custom solution. its a good price for anyone who wants to sell on line."
4,YES WE CAN,This man should be up there with Najee and Meadows . Find it and buy it quick before it disappears for good.
3,The green tint is annoying,"While the film benefits greatly from the high-definition video, the green tint annoys me constantly. True, the film makers intended to have green as the dominant color, but it should not have come at the cost of natural skin tone. I wish the technicians had dialed down the hue."
5,Fantastic,"Excellent - works on UK Xbox 360 - picture quality is amazing , commentary is good and it make 2 and 3 actually worth watching again!"
3,Buyer Beware,Please be aware that this box set is HD DVD. You need a special player that is no longer on the market. I love the Matrix movies and would normally give this set a 5 star rating but Amazon should place a warning that these HD DVDs will not play on a regular DVD player. BUYER BEWARE.
4,"Bravo, Jose Cura!","I can't wait to see a Jose Cura opera performance on DVD. If an Easter concert is this enthralling, just imagine how electrifying his opera performances are.His performance on this DVD is so focused, so dynamic it is exhilirating to watch. His voice is so powerful yet exquisitely beautiful.This DVD would have received 5 stars if the audio quality would be better. The recording is in 5.1 dolby digital however, there is an odd microphone buzz evident in some of the quieter moments. Why can't opera and concerts like this have the same excellent audio quality as the One Night Only Bee Gees DTS DVD? However, despite some audio quality qualms, it is a very realistic sounding DVD, it really sounds as if you are in the church audience.I highly recommend this DVD, Jose Cura is an exceptional artist."
3,Not as successful as Funny Papers,"I enjoyed Tom De Haven's Derby Dugan, but not to the same extent as his Funny Papers. There is more of a dark cloud over the characters in this novel. Yet, although he's no Runyon or P.G. Wodehouse, De Haven creates living characters that you don't mind spending time with."
2,Only buy this if you have linoleum or tile floors!,"I really hoped this would be a good thing for my dog, because he is double coated and really gets hot. But it is wet, and so I could only put it out in the kitchen where I have linoleum. My dog refused to have anything to do with it. Even with encouragement and treats he avoided it. He'd lie down near it, but not on it. If I'd been able to put it in a room he ordinarily likes to hang out in, maybe he would have given it a try. But he doesn't hang out in the kitchen, and he wasn't about to start. So this didn't work for our setup."
4,Good early thriller,"Baron Kurt Von Sepper (Richard Burton) has just married wife # 7, Anne (Raquel Welch) and invites her to live in his secluded castle. While puttering about, Anne finds a mysterious golden key and a secret passage that leads into evidence of the Baron's murderous past."
4,Brilliant,"Brilliant story of how love stuggles to grow in harsh and blistering conditions. The tale is not one told in a straightforward manner. This is what alleviates any boredom that may seemingly occur due to the somewhat slow pace. Yet Zhang Ziyi shines in all the chaos....quite a different character from the one she played in ""Road Home"". If the viewer is not accustomed to asian cinema then they may not get this movie."
5,Give this movie a chance!,"This is such a great movie. Zhang Ziyi does marvelous as always. The plot to this movie is very interesting and it was a really great war love story movie. The cinematography and music were great. I really recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for a love story, a war movie, or just wants to see Zhang Ziyi :)"
5,It was an inspiration !,My son has 6 years old and he is starting to learn the best knowledge in life : to read.Every week he brings a book from his school's library and it is a very special moment for us when we sit together and I read for him. I really enjoy it but this last week was more than special because this book had an important message and it was an inspiration for both of us.
2,Andrew Jackson,"Time Books presidency series,edited by Arthur Schlesinger. Abundantly found but not worth the time. definitely find another read."
4,Populist Andrew Jackson leads the country.,"Another interesting read in the American Presidents series. For the most part, these books are insightful on how we view our past Presidents. Jackson was a populist with some views on how the country should be run. Unfortunately he was also a slave owner and drove the Indians past the Mississippi River. Present day views on both actions are negative. However, Jackson combated the elistist element in American society and opened up politics to the more common man.This is a nice read about Jackson. Some present books are even better, but this short read will bring the basics on Jackson to a reader."
3,Nice costume jewelry.,"Adequate quality for what it is. Didn't have it long before our home was burglarized, though. They took everything! (Knuckleheads, what are they going to do with this pin?)"
3,Not the same colors as picture,"Bought this as a gift. The picture shown is not exactly what I got. The bird with the green head, on the left, has a blue body. The middle bird has a red head and green body. The bird on the right has a blue head with an orange body. It was cheap, and I'm sure the person who I bought this for will still like it (she's a bird lover). It is a small pin, but I like that quality."
5,WHO AMONG US DOESN'T LOVE A STIR FRY?,"In this day and age with so much to do and so little time left to spare, who does not love a good stir fry? A well-prepared stir fry is quick, easy to prepare, nutritious and tasty. Chicken, beef, fish, entirely veggie - the choice is yours. With a little creativity and by varying the ingredients, one can have a whole new meal; the variations are endless. One originally associated the wok with strictly Chinese cooking, and this book quickly enlightens us on that thought. If you think one stir fry is the same as the next, wait until you read this book; it is one I would not want to be without. It is truly a cook's best friend. The recipes are quite different and each one I have tried has been absolutely flavourful and delicious. This book is a ""must-have"" for anyone who does not have the time, energy or desire to spend hours slaving over a hot stove!"
3,PRETTY GOOD BOOK,"When I first viewed the drawing on the cover of this book, I thought most of the photos inside would be of individual Afrika Korps soldiers and their uniforms, weapons, and individual equipment. That's the reason I ordered it. But after receiving the book, I was a bit disappointed to find that almost all the photos were of vehicles and artillery pieces, albeit with some attending troops included in most of them. There were very few closeup photos of individual soldiers, although there is an excellent section of detailed color drawings that highlight troops and their uniform components. Still, the photographs of vehicles and artillery pieces that make up most of the book are impressive and informative. Readers who are mainly interested in Afrika Korps tanks, artillery pieces, scout cars, halftracks, motorcycles, and other vehicles will not be disappointed."
2,STILL seeking her voice,"I positively anticipated the insights that Diane Rehm might have for me regarding the speech disorder, Spasmodic Dysphonia, one I share with her and which frustrates me every day.The beginning of her life's story is mildly engaging; only ""mildly"" because her telling of it lacks the insight and perspective necessary to create a truly compelling memoir. I continued reading, hoping that all this set-up may be leading to something enlightening.As her life progresses on the pages, it becomes less and less intriguing, and I began to wonder when she was going to address Spasmodic Dysphonia (the apparent ""hook"" of the book, according to the dust jacket). Well, all you get is a skimpy relating of her condition near the end of the book, with a startling lack of examination from the author as to how the events leading up to this climax are related to the disorder itself.Very disappointing. Little more than celebrity autobiography, and not outstanding in that context, either."
3,Three stars for the Kindle version,"...and you should read that as four stars for the content, and minus-one star for the format. This book just isn't well suited to the Kindle. First, you have to click on the footnotes to read them, which means you have to use that tiny little touchpad and go line by line, word by word until you land on just the right spot to click. It's an irritating process compared to the paper edition, where you can just glance down and see that oddball DFW digression before popping back into the narrative.Also, there are scan errors and typos -- not a lot, and for all I know they were in the original, but enough to be annoying.Anyway, good book, some interesting essays, but don't get it on Kindle. I can't imagine how Infinite Jest must read on one."
4,Highly Imaginative and Persuasive,"Wallace again amazes with his powers of observation and wit. The title essay is worth the price of admission, although the others are thought provoking as well. I find he can exhaust any topic with his Seinfeld-ian power of dissecting the most mundane minutiae of any experience, and documenting it with annotated footnotes. The catch however is this: his sarcasm and self-deprecation make his near-condescending style contagious and affective.The essays lack congruity though, this may have been planned, but made the volume lose a little luster. Over all, a rare find."
5,"All I can say is, don't read it in public...","That is, unless you're someone who doesn't embarrass easily, or doesn't mind people staring at you and wondering why you're laughing so hard.Seriously, this is one of only two books that has made me laugh so uncontrollably hard that I had to keep putting it down because I couldn't physically control myself (the other being ""Me Talk Pretty One Day""). The last essay, which was the main culprit (and from which this book gets its title), is all about DFW's error-filled romp aboard a Carribean cruise. Just as good, if not quite as funny, are the essays in which he describes a trip to the Illinois state fair, and one in which he describes being on the set of David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"".Highly, highly recommended."
2,A supposedly good book I won't recommend.,"Every page of this book includes about one sentence of lucid, vibrant observation. The rest is decidedly repetitious (he often re-uses/repeats quirky, distinctive thoughts and words within a few pages to little effect) and seems to make the author a candidate for a long lesson on 'sometimes less is more.'"
3,Indulgent Virtuosity?,"Let me come clean, I read most of these essays at publication, and I know they've been changed some for this book, so I really haven't read this book. But still. I have questions. Why all the footnotes? They strike me as gimmicky. Do any other readers find a ""look ma, no hands"" quality to the prose, how it befriends then puts off? Is the point of superintelligence the showing off of superintelligence? These, my questions for other readers"
5,Tracy Lawrence,"Tracy Lawrence is just classic, great voice, great performances, i hope he gets back on top, great music."
3,Interesting but maybe too narrow,"This book has interesting examples of abuse of science and intelectlual sloppiness which alone makes it worth reading. However, its effectiveness is probably somewhat limited as the authors define their scope rather narrowly and consider only examples from their own fields. As such, they explicitly leave out the broader questions of whether postmodernism contributes anything of value to the social sciences or the hummanities as the authors criticized (presumably) would claim. Sometime I wonder whether the analogies to mathematics and science are actually worth taking as seriously as the authors do."
3,Ponderous,"They make their case about the pseudo-scientifc bafflegab of the pomos, but the book is marred by a few irritating things. First they disclaim everything, over and over. ""Do not assume we mean to criticize all of X .."" etc, over and over. They lack wit and sparkle; this could be a lot more fun! And the last part of the book has a lot of tendentious political soap-boxing.Sokal deserves praise for his hoax though."
5,Excellent service,"I found a topic I wanted to write on which I thought this book would be an excellent resource, the only concern I had was not receiving it in time and from the time I ordered this book til now I've got plenty of time to give it a good read, maybe even a second read, and then write my paper. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this topic, from what I've read thus far it's an excellent read. It's tragic what's transpired for our Native people and without authors such as this telling their stories I wouldn't have the same comprehension of this matter."
2,Boring movie !!!!,This is a boring movie !A lost oppurtunity of a great pairing between Rita Hayworth and Robert Mitchum !In the middle of the movie the director Parrish must have losthis interest in it. After the story begins quite original ithangs for half an hour in a terribly long scene featuring Lemmonby himself. Incredible that noone in the cutting rooms saw that this mistaken long scene ruined the film and Rita's comeback in 1957.
5,Top Priority Message,"What If Zebras Lost Their Stripes gives you a perfect occasion to open young minds to how adults of different colors and nationalities -- and kids -- should think about their diversity. With just a little thought, kids will get this top priority message instantly. A great contribution."
4,Beautifuly done,"This is one of my favorite goth albums. I especially enjoy the vocals on this one. They are magnificantly sung, much different from their early stuff like Lost Paradise and Gothic. Although i love the screaming vocals of those albums.I would definently recommend this one to fans of goth/doom stuff. If you are a hardcore fan of their earlier works, then i might shy away from this one."
1,Defective By Design Product,"For those of you who care about their freedom don't buy this album. Not because of the artistic content of the disk, which is at the top (thank you Paradise Lost and Rhys Fulber) but because of the copy protection mechanism. Not only the disk may not play in your car cd-player, but you can play it on your computer only with the poor quality software ""included"" in the disk.express yourself, defend your freedom, don't buy protected-content CDs."
5,Amazing Job,"What an amazing job by Charlize Theron, one of the best performance by any actress i ever seen in my life, she did an amazing job."
3,I don't think it's as good as it's hype.,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie. But from all the hype this movie has been getting, I thought it would've been better. The acting was awesome. The transformation in appearance Charlize made for this movie is just gruesome compared to her everyday look. The plot seemed kinda thin at times and dragged on. I was intrigued by this story and was somewhat disappointed though after watching the movie. I guess I expected more than a drama film, but I would recommend checking it out anyways."
3,not really sorprised,"I do seriously think the movie need more action but maybe the scrip was folloew to closed. Well I liked, but could be better.Ruben Ruix"
1,DISTURBING! UPSETTING!!,"Honestly, I have NEVER seen a movie that has disturbed me this much! Since I have viewed this movie, I have not been able to sleep. I walked out of the theatre, as did everyone else that paid to see it. I would not suggest this title. This film also gives this relationship a sadistic over-tone. The world is bad enough as it is, why waste more of our energy emmercing in past negatvity? This movie is right-out, horrific. I could not stand it, nor could anyone else that was present. Others felt that this films depicited homosexual reltationships in a negatvie light. I have to agree. This was a horrific tale, that should have been left to a documentary. THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE!"
2,"Charlize was good, too bad the movie wasn't","I rented this yesterday being super excited because this movie was supposed to be one of the best films of last year. Some parts were good, but at alot of times I just wanted to hit stop on my remote. Charlize and Christina were great,but the movie just seemed to drag on and on and on."
2,Theron 's acting..only good thing,"I found this movie to be one of the most awful films I've ever seen. It's vile, crude, and profane. Aileen Wuornos starting ""hooking"" by the time she was 13...I've seen many doumentaries and read many to attest to this. How Patty Jenkins can turn someone like that into a victim, is beyond me. Charlize Theron's preformance is brillant, it's the one saving point of the film. If you're going to tell the world about someone's life...be objective...don't put your own personal thoughts and feelings into the mix. Don't base the storytelling on your personal thoughts and feelings. Patty Jenkins should have been more objective...she shouldn't have tried to get the audience to feel sorry for Aileen. She should have portrayed the Aileen for what she was..a sick twisted, human being who refused to be accountable for her actions and tried to paint herself as a victim in a pathetic attempt not to have to pay for her crimes."
3,"Wow, did the Lifetime Network make this?","The movie is alright, but it's not exactly amazing. Charlize Theron is pretty good, but not ""Best Actress"" good -- really, her makeup artist should get that award for the job she did of making Charlize hideous beyond recognition. Christina Ricci is alright, too, but it doesn't take much to whine for a couple of hours. The story isn't exactly going to evoke much empathy, either; no one in a right state of mind would ever empathize with a prostitute that goes on a killing spree. In the end, I had to suspect that it was made for people who watch the Oh! or Lifetime channels (men are evil, women are victims, blah blah blah). Good rental, though, despite the fact that it can't live up to the hype."
3,Hard to Swallow,"Charlize Theron, a very beautiful woman plays the ""John Killer"" as a gawky, tall retard. She wins an Academy Award for being consistently foul, goofy, and murderous. I'm assuming there's a certain amount of sympathy here for an abused from cradle female, but her victims were run of the mill lonely-hearts except for an occasional sadist, but hell why get angry when occupational hazard strikes. Get yourself a lawyer like any worker's occupation case plaintiffChristina Ricci, not in Ghost World, but close, plays Charlize's lover. She's rather retarded too. I can't quite place the blue collar Florida malaise that the audience is supposed to understand instinctively. Well, ah, why didn't lonely Ricci go to beautician school and meet some gals of the same persuasion on line. The whole idea that a down-and-out boozer could even interest this young mixed up girl is hard to swallow. Oh, but this is a true-life story. Never mind."
4,"Gritty, gut wrenching film","Monster's content was difficult to digest. However, if you focus on the performace of Charlize, you will be amazed. Most of the time, you will not recognize her. Only once or twice for a second, I detected a hint of Charlize Theron. Unbelievable gritty performance by a top notch actor who took on this incredibly brave role."
1,Can I have my money back?,"I rented this movie thinking it would be a great suspense film as I had heard. To my dismay... the movie was like an independent film. Although there is some great acting, it was as difficult to sit through as the Blair Witch Project. Basically I asked for my money back."
4,A new twist on a Journey song,"I got a kick out seeing Charlize and Christine roller skating to Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" That scene alone makes the movie pretty cool."
5,"If you&#65533;d lived her life, you&#65533;d be her too","A brilliant portrayal of what we'd rather not know. It's a story of the betrayal of one woman. Raped, abused, falling into a world of fantasy and prostitution, she fights for her single chance at a happy life in the only way she knows. This is one of those wonderful films that show us our own judgmentalism. How many are of us are so content to look at the unfortunates around us and feel a buzz of moral superiority because we aren't there? The film pointedly shows us how unfortunates become unfortunates. I was deeply moved."
3,One of Glass' Less Successful Scores,"I did not have an opportunity to see the film, so I am only able to judge the score in isolation from the film. Let me say at the outset that I believe Glass is one of the most important composers of the latter half of the 20th century. That said, I was disappointed with the score for Naqoyquatsi, and it does not reach the sublime heights of the scores for Koyannisqatsi or even Powaquatsi. The score for _The Hours_ is vastly superior, and I was very disappointed it did not win an Oscar. The Naqoyqatsi score is not a complete waste of time, as it does have its moments. Yo-yo Ma's cello work is particularly good; I would have liked to have heard more. I especially appreciated the use of acoustic instruments rather than the banks of synthesizers Glass often uses. Still, this is not among Glass' best work."
5,Dreamy...,"It took me some time to get used to this soundtrack. I kept expecting the driving beats like those found on the previous two soundtracks of the Qatsi trilogy. But I learned that was really me imposing my expectations onto the music. There is definitely a similar 'feel' comparable to the other two but the music on this one is much more dreamy, ethereal if you wish.Obviously it has a more 'classical' feel due to Yo Yo Ma's cello playing but it also stretches, even transcends, the classical genre and is much more atmospheric. It also carries you away. Just like the previous two soundtracks, over time it begins to dawn on you that another masterpiece has been created."
2,A One Trick Pony,Only marginally shaggy. But a script waiting for the end to be what it is. Totally derivative from other slasher movies. What hadn't they done? OK: that's our ending.
3,Such a different film...,"The only thing you have to consider when deciding to watch this video is: COMEDY. There is nothing so scary about the movie to classify it under horror. If I had a choice, I'd put it under comedy. It's great to make fun of. Some movies are great because of their actors or cinematography. This one is great because it's easy to make fun of. I loved it! Absolutely loved it!"
5,A different summer camp movie,"A good story of how parents change their children's idea of who they are, and why they are pressed into certain roles. Fun, scary, curios and memorable."
2,really really bad,i remeber seeing this flick with my sister her friend at the time let her borrow it the story is wierd the characters are stupid but i wont spoil the story just incase you actually want to watch this movie i believe there are two sequels that are even worse than this one watch if you dare
4,Another great Bush CD,"This is a really great Bush CD. I still think that Sixteen Stone is their best album, but Golden State definatly has some of those qualities: guitars that scream w/ talent, deep lyrics, and that sometimes eeire ""Bush"" emotion to it. Some of the tracks that have stood out to me are ""Solutions"", ""Headful of Ghosts"", ""The People We Love"", ""Superman"",""Fugitive"",and ""Land of the Living"". These a lot like Bush's earlier stuff, the other songs are really good too. As always, they threw in some slow mellow ones, so don't be suprised, just enjoy them. If your a Bush fan, check out the CD, i think you'll enjoy it."
2,I Feel Let Down...,"Well the new Bush CD came out, and I decided to go and buy it. Sometimes if you follow a band for a long time, whether or not you think you'll like the CD, you feel obligated to buy it. Well I did, and I was really looking forward to it on the drive there. When I got home though, my enthusiasm faded. I was wanting to hear something new, but deep down i wanted to hear their Brit-grunge all over. The first few songs are good, and about two more throughout the CD. The rest, while not being BAD songs, have nothing special. They sound complacite, cliched, and predictable: exactly what I don't want in a new CD. When a breakdown was coming (a very nice Bush signature move) you could tell way before time, and a big crescendo/build-up was coming you could tell. And, something that i really don't like, the single ""The People That We Love,"" is the best song on the CD. So in short, this CD is good for a Bush fan, but if you're borederline pick up ""Razorblade Suitcase"" or ""Sixteen Stone."""
5,Golden State is truly a Golden album,"This album expresses what Bush is all about. From the hard rocking guitars, to the smooth soulful voice of Gavin Rossdale this is Bush at its utmost best. Not since Sixteen Stone have they mastered their craft so skillfully. If anyone fell in love with Sixteen Stone then this is the next step that comes the most close to it."
2,Unsanitary nipples,"My son could drink out of it fine, but it won't seem to clean properly after using pediasure strawberry flavor. It just sucks up the smell and who knows what else I bought the glass bottle yesterday, put the pediasure in it an hour ago, he drank it, I washed it, boiled it washed it again, and I simply cannot get the aroma out of this very very soft nipple."
2,Discontinued product,"I don't want to buy a discontinued product,the factory abandon this for a better line,I can not get full options and I dont have support because it is old and have many problems reason of discontinued."
2,Ready to stop reading after the 2nd chapter!,"I had high hopes for this book after reading the reviews and description here. By the time I got through the 2nd chapter, I didn't want to read anymore. Who in their right mind would think it's ""romantic"" and ""sexy"" to have a guy coming on to you like that after a near rape? Come on! And then to have him tell her he wants to share her with his buddies??? If you want romance, especially military based romance, read Stephanie Tyler I loved her books--not so much erotica but great sex and romance. This was the first book I read by Lora Leigh and I'm not sure I want to try another if this is the demented way her characters act.One more beef with this book--it is TOTALLY unbelievable. I like fantasy as much as the next girl, but really, if the bad guy was just about to take her ""in the rear"" do you really think that her scream would have stopped him long enough to wait for the neighbor to come running and break down the door?Sorry--not impressed."
4,A Sexy read,"Rowdy Mackay has been in love with Kelly Benton long before he should be. So to advoid problems Rowdy joins the Marines and leaves for eight years. Right before he comes home Kelly is attacked,which make her afraid of a man's touch even Rowdy's. But now Rowdy is home but the danger is still near.""Nauti Boy"" is the lastest book by Lora Leigh and I really liked it. Ms. Leigh gives the reader a real plot line and not just mindless sex and while some say it is not as good as her ""August Books"" I really liked it and can't wait for the next book in the series."
2,Dissatisfaction,The recent order that I received is not up to your ususl high standards. Some of the NuStevia White Stevia Powder packets were empty and some have only a few grains of stevia in them. I am very displeased with this shipment. I have been ordering from your company for quiet awhile and have not had this problem.
5,This Soundtrack is Da Bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Buy it, listen to it, love it. That's all I have to say and that's all you need to hear. This soundtrack is awesome!"
3,it's NOT floyd,"As a Pink Floyd fan, I can say that I am sorely dissapointed in Class of 99's cover of Pink Floyd's most popular song ""Another Brick in the wall (part 2)"" While the instrumentals are good, the singing is just pittiful, they sound like stupid stoned teenagers. Pink Floyd had passion when they sang the song, and so did the chorous of Brittish children. Before I get some crude remarks from my peers (I'm 16), let me just say that all the other songs on the soundtrack are pretty good, but I cannot, with a clear consience, recommend Class of 99's version of ""Another Brick in the wall (Part 2)"" if you buy this CD, skip over the first track, then the rest is very good. But if you would like to hear a good version of ""ABitW (2)"" I recommend buying ""A Collection of Great Dance Songs"" by Pink Floyd, I even think that buying that would be cheaper than buying this CD."
5,Great party soundtrack!,"This is one of the greatest rock soundtracks I've ever heard. I love all songs on it and that's very unusual for soundtracks. It's great party music. When you like one of the bands on this soundtrack, you will love all the songs on it, I guarantee it. My favourite tracks are both parts of ""Another Brick in the Wall"", it's a great cover version of the original by Pink Floyd, and ""School's Out"" by Soul Asylum, also a cover version. All songs are great! I bought it last year in February and well I hear it over and over again."
4,Operator/biker,This wrks good lips hurt first time you get used to it you just do a buzzing with lips on it slowly and try a lil light then harder a difrent sound if your bird likes it hell cme in mine did seventy yds 31/2 mag got em thx and a bad day hunting beats a good day at wrk thx im bat have a good day a diffrent sound loud
5,Study good looking glasses,We like glasses made of thick glass that kind of resemble the crackle glass styles of old. I think the price is reasonable: $5 apiece. We had another set of the amber color that have been our everyday glasses for over five years. They still look out of the box new. This glass doesn't seem to scuff like the cheap thin glass does.
3,Beautiful but crafting quality doesn't seem right.,"For the price and with such a rough appearance I expected these to be very thick and heavy duty, but as stunning to look at as these are they aren't the type of sturdy glassware you expect at $10+ per piece. The ""bubble grain"" look is interesting but doesn't appear professionally done, and when you wash them they feel fragile. Overall, because of the price and lack of obvious quality (even compared to ""lesser"" glassware) I would not buy these again."
5,Greatest Glasses ever.,These glasses are amazing and well worth the money. Sturdy and beautiful. I have purchased them in several colors. My sister in law saw these in my kitchen and immediately ordered them for herself!
5,heavy duty,I was so tired of glasses braking that I decided to try this style. These are great! No more falling over in the sink or opening the dishwasher to find a broken glass. The color is more slate than cobalt which I desired. They were correctly listed so I can't complain.
1,I could write a better algebra book!,"I bought this because I've never been great at math, and wanted to refresh myself before I go back to school. It's the WORST book I've ever bought! The answers in the back don't match the questions you're supposed to be answering! What's up with that!? How are you supposed to know if you are doing this right if they give you wrong answers??"
1,a forgery,"This book is without a doubt a forgery. It was sold by the notorius forger John Laflin who later tried to sell letters and documents by Andrew Jackson and David Crockett. The famous handwriting expert, Charles Hamilton discovered the Laflin forgeries. It is also quite well known that the Lafitte Journal and the de la Pena diary were both written by the same person. Both are fakes and were probably commissioned by a group of forgers and frauds operationg out of Houston and Austin Texas in the 1950's and 1960's."
5,Another Great Bogart,"There is a reason the AFI ranked Bogart as the #1 actor in the history of film, The Enforcer was a great movie and one that I own."
4,Bogart in Post-War Japan,"TOKYO JOE (1949) may not be one of Humphrey Bogart's classic films, but it is certainly an entertaining thriller that features Bogie playing the kind of hard-boiled character that pleased his audiences.Set in post-war Japan, the Stuart Heisler-directed picture has Bogart cast as an ex-serviceman, returning to Tokyo, his home before the attack on Pearl Harbor. He is surprised to learn that his wife (Florence Marly), who he thought was dead, has divorced him and is now married to attorney Alexander Knox. He also learns that he has a child.To stay in Japan, Bogart forms an alliance with ex-Secret Service head Sessue Hayakawa. They start an air-freight business together, which Bogie soon learns is just a front to smuggle Japanese war criminals back into the country. Events come to a head when Hayakawa kidnaps Bogart's child to insure his silence.If you like Bogart, this one is worth a look.Michael B. Druxman"
3,Humphy Dumphy,"Bogart never made a bad flick and this film is not bad either, but its not on top of Bogart's best work ? For those that want to view all of Bogies work, this is reasonable entertainment, but don't expect Key Largo or Casablanca and you won't be disappointed."
3,great bra except the straps are too short,"I actually love all my miracle bras and ordered two more online here but the straps are too short. I realized now that the bra's I had are 38C and the bras i ordered are 38B, but i am surprised that the main difference was in strap length! These bras do last."
5,The Only Bra,This is the only bra for me! I've tried so many and I keep coming back to this one. No lines and very comfortable!
4,Good Book,"Never had heard Smerconish on the radio. Wasn't real sure who he was. He has did a lot of research on this book. Has very short chapters dealing with a topic and gives his views on it. Such as giving trophies now to kids for anything and everything including just participating or the intellectual design theory. It's a mostly conversative view book just warning you, but it's interesting. I enjoy the different topics and it got me thinking about how I felt about them."
1,"Not shocking stories at all, and poorly written to boot","Anyone from a corporate environment will not find these stories shocking at all. Sure, we all wish these examples of the world-gone-overly-PC weren't true, but in today's environment each of these stories ended up exactly as one would expect.If that weren't all, the book is poorly written, taking stories that should be a page or two long and making them five or more pages by adding an unnecessary amount of pontification and parenthesis."
3,Decent Top Coat (but not the best base coat),"The top coat is everything a top coast is expected to be. It dries pretty quickly and with a shine that lasts. The base coat, on the other hand, doesn't create the smooth foundation that other base coats do."
3,DIDN't LIKE!!,I don't personally think this does what it says.. The Sephore star to finish just doesn't start so it definitely doesn't finish.. Went back to my Perfect Formula base coat and PF top coat SORRY SEPHORA I love OPI but Not you
5,Great Product,This is a great bottom/top coat. Gives your polish a longer life and help from those dark colored stains when you remove it.
4,1st class rhythms and rhymes,"I'd heard things here and there by and about Large Pro, but I still hadn't gotten a clear idea of his ability until I heard this album. The man obviously knows how to lay a beat, not sound too repetetive, and his rhymes--while not on a groundbreaking level--are still crisp and easily to listen to, not boring, corny, they sound sincere..simple as that, Large Pro is one of the most underrated artists around and for the most part this LP says so."
4,Large Professor is Hip Hop History,"Large Professor is a legend in the rap game. His reign of terror was from 1990-1995, and I could never figure out why he dissappeared for so long. But alas, the master is back with the ill beats and... hey, where are the rhymes? The Mad Scientist has some pretty good hooks in his tracks, but the lyrics are lacking. Then again, I didn't buy this album for the lyrics! It's all about the crazy ill beats; the hooks were a total bonus. This CD is totally worth having in your collection."
4,"Long awaited, Anticipated!","At last L.P. hits us off with an LP! Large Pro has been rocking it with other emcees for many years but never dropped an album until this. The album is near perfect, except that Hip Hop heads had to wait so long! A Must BUY!"
4,Looks great.,"It is just right and matches my other trees, The ornaments don't drag on the table. That is important when they are crystal."
2,Soft Core Asian Exotica,"If your expecting a hard core S&M film starring lots of gorgeous Asian Babes, look elsewhere. While the women in this movie are definatly pretty, you won't so much as see a genuine slap. Although there are amusing scenes of gentlemen beating couches behind babes in bondage. There isn't even that much nudity. I rate this at '2' Stars because those attracted to the premise are likely to be somewhat dissapointed. Overall production is on the level of ""Spice"", perhaps a bit lower."
3,A decent attempt at being clever,"While I was watching this, I suspected there'd be a plot twist at the end. And there was...it just wasn't the one I was expecting. For being able to surprise me like that, I give this a midrange rating. I appreciate the effort at a clever ending.However, as far as horror movies go, this one is just okay. It didn't scare me at all...but it was suspenseful enough to hold my interest.The acting was mediocre. The lead actress's performance was too underdone...she didn't respond with the appropriate level of fear a normal person would have if they saw the things she saw in this movie.And I thought the acting by the blonde nurse was just the opposite...too overdone. So, you've got the lead not trying hard enough and the evil nurse villain trying too hard. The rest of the actors, however, gave decent performances.Overall, a decent effort, but not exactly original. I've seen this plot twist before...though I won't say where or you'll know exactly what that plot twist is."
3,Visual bubblegum,"Other than the two young leading ladies there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. They are eye candy but the movie is stale bread. This theme has been done more often than our President lies....many, many times.Worth a rental? Good question....could have made a much better choice but there was the eye candy factor that cannot be overlooked!!"
2,Dreadful remake of a great movie,"This movie probably wouldn't seem so dreadful if you hadn't already seen Tale of Two Sisters, the Korean film from which it was adapted, and a excellent film. The plots are quite similar, some scenes even stolen completely from the original in staging, acting, and mood. But the Guard boys missed the point of the original movie, and as a result have made a boring, unscary and pointless film out of a terrifying, bittersweet one. The basic problem is the stepmother--the stepmother in Two Sisters is insane; she has to be insane in order to make the plot work. They seem not to have realized that. Add uninspired acting, a bunch of pawns playing out a logic puzzle as the girls try to figure out who their father's girlfriend really is, and none of the symbolism that the Korean film had. It's just a mediocre remake of a movie that shouldn't have been touched."
4,POIGNANT SUSPENSE/HORROR,"I very much enjoyed this movie. I always love a twist ending, one that I don't see until the last few minutes or the film, and this movie delivered that beautifully.Thinking people who enjoy total misdirection of their emotions and perceptions right up to the climax will love this one."
4,Great product,Useful for crafting work and for mounting terrain features onto metal bases for my projects. Easy to use and quick to dry.
5,"Global Community and Respect for Others Labor,","Thought provoking! I recommend this book for everyone interested in a lesson on community, labor rights and respect. Sadly, Fink is able to highlight how we Americans take so many things for granted and focus on differences and not similarities. So common that we want to take advantage of individuals who don't speak the same language, wear they same type of clothes and are are willing to do jobs we believe are beneath us. This goes for people in our immediate communities and communities of the world. The Guatemalan taught the Morganton's some valuable lessons we should all aspire to learn and practice. Makes you want to act!"
3,Zombies in Heat,"Considering this film was made in the 70's it is pretty well done. One gets a claustrophobic feel due to the constriction of the apartment dwelling in which this movie is set. ""Parasites with a Purpose"" or ""Lust for a Zombie"" might have been alternate titles due to the zombie feel and topic of this not so scary horror flic. The sound quality is sub par at best although the picture quality is acceptable. Barbara Steele making out with another cutie was the high point in this rather weak attempt. Not as bad as other 70's drive-in fodder but not as good as it could have been."
1,Liberal interpretation of the hippocratic oath,"Mr Cronenberg a thief? Well, I thought he might have 'borrowed' some ideas from Pasolini's SALO, but it appears they were released around the same time. If anyone's been light with their fingers over this movie then it's George A Romero.Reprehensible use of minors in this picture cannot make this anything other than a one star, but see it for Paul Hampton as doctor Roger St Luc. His performance rocks!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A movie that showcases better than any other David Cronenberg's love of all things carnal, Shivers suffers from the fact that it can't hide its influences (Invasion of the Body Snatchers being chief among them) but offers an entertaining horror film that will appeal to fans of the genre looking for something new."
4,The Day I Found David,"I knew Cronenberg had a great future the day I walked into SHIVERS in 1976. Friends thought I was bats, but it was so obvious this director had a unique take on human behavior and some issues about life, death and biology that were eating, ha, away at him (actually he had watched his dear father die a horrible death from cancer). SHIVERS is serious and wack at once, contains some wonderfully subversive imagery, some camp moments (Barbara Steele cooing ""kiss me, kiss me, kiss me""), and a very haunting score cobbled together from library cues(!). It's one of those treasures that stands up to many 'readings', and can be viewed as a psychic precurser to the AIDS tragedy, and/or the persistent quest of the yuppie to find the perfect home only to have his id come-a-knockin'."
5,Polar Express rules!,"Polar Express is a wonderful movie! My grandson who is 3 yrs. old loves it! I got 2 of them and sent one to him, along with a bell. He loved that!"
5,fast shipment,"We already own this movie, but not on Blu-Ray. I got a great deal on this movie and with my Prime membership, it came the very next day!"
5,My son's Favorite Holiday Movie,My 3 year old son loves the movie Polar express. I had saved it on our DVR and we watched it so much but had to fast forward all the commericals. Great Movie for all ages!
5,Great fun,I purchased this DVD as a Christmas gift for my Granddaughter. It is wonderful fun and a true delight.
1,In A Nutshell... Creepy,"Well, to start with let me say that I have the highest regard for both Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis. In fact, I will go out of my way to see movies that these two are involved. So when I started hearing bad press about this movie I ignored it and went and saw this with an open mind.Here's my verdict in a nutshell... creepy.The animation is a huge let down. The characters look like fuzzy zombies from a video game intro (many have even referred to this movie as the Resident Evil of Christmas cartoons).I can't believe the studios (and theres a heck of a lot of them) decided to put their money on the line and release this highly disturbing movie."
1,DUD,I attempted to play this DVD for my grandson and got the error message that my player could not read the DVD. I'd give it no stars but the system won't let me leave that blank.
1,"Movie is Fabulous, 3-D is HORRIBLE!!","Do not bother purchasing this in 3D version, the quality is horrible. We were so excited about the possibility of this movie being in 3D because we absolutely LOVE this movie. But the picture was just as bad with the glasses on as they are without the glasses. Just very poorly done and EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. . . But please purchase this in 2D version! The story is wonderful and it makes you feel like you're on this magical journey through christmas, mesmerizing and fantastical!"
1,The Worst Movie of all time!,Um u got 2 be gidding right? yeh this movie waz awful worst then you and ur mom!
4,"Good Movie for Kids,Better for the Adults","Polar Express is one of those movies that just helps you to get away from it all,It will take you away to once you were a kid and believed in christmas.It has excellent details and the Dolby 5.1 sound blows you away.I could watch this movie over and over thinking about my younger days.The only drawback for me was the elves..(they looked a bit creepy and mean)..The rest of it was fantastic..So,take your mind off Reality for once and just go back to the fantasy days.."
5,great in 3D,I love the 3D start off slow to be expected but was a big improve meant since the first one I read review on. If you read any horrible review under this movie keep in mind a lot of the bad ones post were intended for the old 3D version. You won't regret it :).
4,Took some adjustment,"After reading all of the other positive ratings we could not wait for this to arrive. It is one of our favorite holiday movies! Our family had mixed reviews on the 3D effects. The red /blue glasses are really hard to adjust to. We had to really work with the brightness, contrast and sharpness settings on our TV. In the end my youngest daughter and I adjusted to the glasses and the 3D was wonderful! For my husband and oldest daughter, the 3D never worked quite right and was very disappointing. A 3D version made for a 3D TV with regular glasses would be so much better. I am not usually a huge 3D fan but the effects in this movie are worth it!"
3,Polar Express 3D Blu-ray not IMAX quality,"This is a great holiday film. I saw the original 3D at the IMAX theater and it was stunning to say the least. I did have my hopes high for this Blu-ray release. After all, Blu-ray is high quality and with an HD TV, it has to be good, correct? Well, the quality is not nearly as good as the IMAX showing. It's not perfectly aligned while watching it. The color is somewhat subtle because of the Red/Cyan glasses and how it is viewed. If you do buy this 3D copy, the disc also has the regular 2D film on it. I wasn't impressed at all, but with all of that said, I do feel people will still enjoy it. It does show some depth, but if you loved IMAX, don't expect the same effect here."
2,One of my favorite Christmas stories,"The info on the page said it was 2 disc, but there was only 1 disc, that made me a little grumpy. Other wise great movi."
4,Polar Express,Great movie! Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside about the anticipation of Christmas. Great kids movie. My kids and I all watch this movie every year.
1,I wasted my $$$ on this garbage?,"The answer is yes. The story itself is wonderful. The 3D version has to be the biggest piece of 3D junk ever produced. No matter how I tried, move the glasses closer to my eyes, further from my eyes, whatever, there were obvious ghosting of images still visible. The 3D should stand for 3 ""D""oses of Excedrin because that is what you'll need for your headache after trying to watch this train wreck (yes the pun is intended)."
1,Great movie but the 3-D sucks,"We bought this for our kids thinking that watching it in 3-D would be AWESOME but were sorely disappointed. Barely any of the movie actually showed up as being 3-D. We darkened the room to see if that would help and we adjusted the contrast as suggested but it still didn't help. Thankfully, there was a regular version in the box as well so we stopped the 3-D one and popped in the original. Much better.Do yourself a favor and stick to the non-3-D version!"
1,polar express video vhs,"ordered this item on December 22nd. Never received it, so I canceled the order."
2,This train doesn't seem to know where its going...,"Chris Van Alsberg's beloved Christmas classic is brought to the screen in this sickeningly self indulgent, outrageously overblown animated film. The characters are bland,and their movements are creepy and mechanical, both of which make them feel more like robots than humans. The film's biggest problem is that it dosen't seem to know whether to treat itself like a horror movie, a children's Christmas cartoon, or a slapstick comedy. The film overflows with half-baked ideas,for instance,there is a mysterious hobo-zombie who makes his homeon the train's roof and a room filled with abandoned toys. It is NOT an exaggeration to describe the film as creepy, as many other reviewers have. While not quite the ''cat''astrophe of the Seuess films,THE POLAR EXPRESS is still something of a train wreck.SCORE:4/10"
3,(Full Screen Edition) is for old school TV! NOT HDTV :(,"Well, my 3 year old daughter and I love this movie. Who doesn't? We were able to view the movie though Amazon streaming digital service for 48hrs. Well I supose that version was letter box edition because nothing was cut off. When I got the DVD was awful. Eveything was closeup and cut off. I am disappoined. I payed $8bucks so could be worse. I will give this to a family member who has a old school TV. Hope this helps out other in making a decision on future purchase of DVD's. I learned something."
5,Instant Classic,"This movie is an instant Christmas Classic. It belongs on the shelf with A Christmas Story, Christmas Vacation, Miracle on 34th street and the rest. Great movie for adults that have become Scrooges over time.And to the person who said ""I expected it to be bad, but it was worse"", you are officially the first person I have ever heard of that saw a movie that they expected to be bad. Why spend the money? And if you dont like feel good movies, DONT GO SEE THEM! Leave them to us people that do like that kind of thing!"
2,3D is Horrible,"While I like the movie and think it is a good reflection of the book and its art, the 3D on this disc is AWFUL. It was one of the first titles I bought for my new blu ray player and at first I thought that there was something wrong with my eyes, but my wife confirmed that she couldn't stand the 3D either. I then checked here and saw other threads with the same complaint. Shame on the manufacturer for this! I would rate it 1 star, but since the 2D version is great, I gave it 2 stars. The movie itself deserves 4-5 stars."
5,Polar Express Rocks,This is the movie for Christmas holidays. Sitting down with your child or children will warm your heart and truly make them 'Believe'. Tom Hanks was great with his many different characters.
5,Polar Express,We looked all over for this movie an could not find it anywhere. Got on Amazin and there it was! We are so happy!
2,not what i expected!!,The movie is spectacular. it is everything i expected. but the dvd kept skipping and pausing. it had a lot of glitches in it. the kids even commented on how often it paused and didn't run smoothly!
1,"Creepy, creepy, creepy!!!!!","I have never written a review, but I have to warn you all about this one. What a horrible, creepy movie!!!! I thought this was going to be some warm, feel-good Christmas classic, but instead I felt like I was watching a children's episode of Resident Evil at the North Pole. The creepy echoes, desolate villages, and scary elves are sure to give me nightmares tonight - and I'm 36 years old! And what was with the Steve Tyler (Aerosmith) elf singing at the end? Oh, brother. If I could give this a ZERO, I would."
3,POLAR EXPRESS,"GOOD MOVIE LOVE WATCHING IT AT CHRISTMAS AND ANYOTHER TIME , MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN HAS GREAT VISUAL"
5,wow,Arrived quickly and will be enjoyed for years to come. Its a great movie that the whole family enjoies. Love this movie
5,The CRITIC!!,"I'm supposed to criticize movies, but there is so much AWESOMENESS about this one that I won't even bother!! If you love incredible things likeChristmas Excitement and Baby Deer and Love and Life and even some wonder and fantasy, then this movie needs to be on the top of your list! I rented it, then bought it as fast as I could find a copy. I especially liked the train ride scene where the Dancer/Chefs exited the kitchen galley area and served the children Hot Chocolate!! Absolutely amazing. See this movie with someone you truly love... Cheers ---"
5,Instant classic,"I absolutely love this movie, ever since it premiered in theathers I have watched it every Christmas! This is a wonderful story of simply believing."
5,WOW!,"This is an outstanding movie for children and adults alike. It is both entertaining and thought provoking. The animation and cinematography is supurb. The music is beautiful, and its' choreography is awesome. I'm not usually a fan of Tom Hanks, but his multiple performances are memorable, and captivating!"
1,Polar Express,The DVD was flawed and did not play in my player. I tried it in other players as well and it did not play.
2,Not good,This is a red/blue glasses movie that is not stereoscopic and it is not very good. There is a HD disc that is included and can be viewed in 2D to 3D which is the same as viewing the red/cyan disc.
3,Just okay,"It was an excellent in the animated sense, but as I was watching with our 5 year old grandson, and 9 year old granddaughter, we discovered the train ride antics were quite a bit scary, especially for the 5 year old. Actually, we were a little bit surprised that they had to include such parts, especially knowing young ones would be watching."
1,3D was awful,"This 3D version came with ""3d"" glasses & the quality was awful. We have a 3D TV & all of the movies we have watched have been great but this one was not. The 2D blu-ray was good. The glasses don't fit kids well at all, so we watched it in 2D. I imagine that is why the price of this movie was so cheap."
3,Polar express 3d,"I was very disappointed that this was not a real d 3d movie, it came with red and green 3d glasses. I expected good quality 3d and this was not it!"
3,3-D Imagery leaves much to be desired,"The red/blue 3-D system used here leaves much to be desired. There's a lot of ghosting (double imaging), particularly through the red filter, and few of the 3D images really ""pop."" All red/blue systems have their problems, but they seems worse on this DVD. Those snow flakes that ought to be so real you can almost catch them on your tongue are a blur. The magenta/blue system used recently on the home 3-D edition of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is much better and has much less ghosting. In all, ""Polar Express 3-D"" is a disappointment, especially if you saw ""Polar Express"" in IMAX 3-D a few years back or in several annual reissues."
4,"DVD is good, but This Movie is best on IMAX","Excellent children's movie, with techno-geek special effects that reach to your ""inner nerd"". As a story, it's OK but too predictable. That's why it's an excellent kid's movie though.But like classic cinema, this is something best experienced in a ""state of the art"" (or is it now ""state of the technology""?) viewing and listening environment. The scenes here are not scaled for TV (which, despite the 'big screen' hype, still means less than 1 meter across for most viewers); they're scaled for larger-than-life viewing. The detail and richness of the computer graphics are not maintained when the resolution is only 1050 scan lines (HDTV) and almost completely lost at normal TV resolution levels.You can still enjoy the DVD, but to get the full ""movie magic"" experience you will have to go to the nearest IMAX (or equivalent) to see this film."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","I sat down to watch this on DVD with my five-year-old granddaughter, not expecting very much because of the general poverty (in my opinion) of most kid's animated films. On the other hand, I'm a librarian and I'm aware of the high regard in which Chris Van Allsburg's book is held by children's librarians. And I confess I was impressed -- mostly -- with how well the film carried out the art and action of the book. It's not a ""straight"" animation, in that it uses 3D motion-capture techniques to give the characters lifelike movements. Tom Hanks does a surprisingly good job voicing the conductor and Santa and all the other adult males, even if he can't sing worth a damn. And, having grown up around railroaders, I loved the details of the train itself. On the other hand, my granddaughter was very uneasy during the vertiginous runaway-train scenes. I know a lot of animated-film fans hated this movie, but it wasn't bad."
1,Polar Express HD DVD,I can't give an opinion. We don't have a HD player. SO can't watch it on our set!We were given a regular DVD. The movie is GREAT.
1,Creepy....And Boring..... Pass,"I watched the Polar Express waiting to be blown away by the stellar computer animation and special effects. Instead I found the Polar Express to be an eerily creepy animated film wherein CGI characters replace human beings with a mannequin-like unnatural quality I found unsettling. The worst animated character was Santa who didn't look very jolly at all, and seemed to scowl and frown for most of his appearance in a stern manner I found unpleasant.At times the computerized nonsense reached a new height of frenzy (such as the hot chocolate scene) which might appeal to children but made me want to reach for the fast-forward button.The only character which I thought seemed natural was the black girl, whose personality and character stole the show.1 star. Huge disappointment. Creepy moppet-like characters, frenzied animation and no plot to speak of. May appeal to really young kids."
2,not for younger kids!,"I got this movie because we take our daughter to the Polar Express train ride (in Boston, MA area) for two years now, and she loves the experience. The movie clips I saw were very child friendly even though the animated characters are a bit weird... When we started watching the movie we only made it to the point where the boy goes to the top of the train to look for the conductor and the girl.. The scary guy made us turn off the move! This is NOT for a 4 year old for sure!"
5,Very enjoyable.,It's a classic!! What more can I say. Tom Hanks does it all. He plays a bunch of characters. Great.
5,Incredible.,I bought this for my neice and her sons. I had a tough time letting it go because I ended up watching it and loved it so much. I couldn't part with it so I bought her another copy! Egads. This is good for kids and big kids(like way). Really genius stuff.
1,3D Polar Express bad glasses?,"I'm not sure if it is the glasses or the film, but no matter where we sat the picture was badly distorted. We were seeing double!"
1,Dancing Waiters not Appreciated!,"I got up and left after 15 minuites of this. The computer animation is awful, and the story is lame. All the carachters look like they are puppets, not real pepole. I could not stand the accent Tom Hanks put on for the part of the conductor. It made the movie even worse. The Hot Choclate scene inspired me to get up and flee the theater. Maybe a 3 year old will find some pleasure in this, but a 12 year old certainly dosn't.!!!!"
4,The Polar Express,"The Polar Express heralded a brave new world of all-digital filmmaking. Critics and audiences were divided between those who hailed it as an instant classic that captures the visual splendor and evocative innocence of Chris Van Allsburg's popular children's book, and those who felt that the innovative use of ""performance capture""--to accurately translate live performances into all-digital characters--was an eerie and not-quite-lifelike distraction from the story's epic-scale North Pole adventure. In any case it's a kind-hearted celebration of the yuletide spirit, especially for kids who have almost grown out of their need to believe in Santa Claus. Tom Hanks is the nominal ""star"" who performs five different computer-generated characters, but it's the visuals that steal this show, as director Robert Zemeckis indulges his tireless pursuit of technological innovation."
2,The Polar Express,The Polar Express (Full Screen Edition)The DVD is skipping again. I sent the first one back for that reason but haven't had a chance to send this one back yet. Is there a reason why they are skipping when I am asking for new not used? Other then that the movie is amazing. My grandson loves it and always asks for the kid and the train.Diane
1,dvd The Polar Express,This dvd quality is really bad in terms of Good like new as i found on the web-site.It pops so much time and doesn't play well. The seller must explain the truth.
1,BEWARE and WATCHFUL,I ordered the movie and never received it. I was never notified that the movie was returned to them. I was only offered a refund after contacting them.
3,"Train Conductor, LittleBoy & Santa",I Thought The Movie was 105 Minutes Snata Could Of Pick him for the last 6 Minutes But Santa Did a good Choice Alllaboard!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Definately a 5 star film!!!,"This movie is one of the most endearing, mezmerizing films I have ever seen. This story is just excellent, and the animation is WONDERFUL!! My son and his best friend (who went with us) were both engrossed in this film!!! There is not enough that I can say about this film!! EXCELLENT!!!! EXCELLENT!!! GO see this movie today!!! You owe to yourself to just....BELIEVE!!"
5,Magical!!,"A fantastic new ""classic"" to add to your traditional Christmas viewing. Heartwarming and beautifully done. It's a must see for the season."
4,"Not similar to the picture, but very nice.","I like this pendant a lot. It's about the size of a dime, but the star in the picture is not like the star on the pendant. The star on the pendant doesn't have the overlapping of the lines like the picture, but instead just a star with the pentagon in the middle. I didn't think that it was that small, but it's still nice and i like it. :) i didn't think that it would come with a cord(black), but it did and its very short. I ended up taking it off and using a chain from one of my older necklaces. I was also worried it might leave green lines like cheap jewelry does, but it does not do that. overall very pleasing, but not quite what i was expecting."
5,This is pleasure and pain,"I never realize that Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful or on the other word ""clever, sexy and mysterious"" not after I watch this movie on HBO... I saw Batman Returns, I saw her other movies, but this is the movie that shows her as a talented and almost perfect girl... yep, girl !!! and I am a fan of Bruce Willis too... He's funny and almost wise...See this movie, it is good for building up your broken relationship again, I hope...."
3,Good Movie - 3 and a half stars,"Immediately upon watching this movie, I thought the formula Rob Reiner used was familiar to me. It was, Story of Us has similar type of flashbacks as the way When Harry Met Sally Did. The major difference is WHMS was about the beginning of a relationship, Story of Us is about the end of one. Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer both give excellent performances in their role as husband and wife. Rob Reiner was very good in his supporting role. This is one of those movies that will make you think about your own relationship. You will wonder if you are giving 100% or trying hard enough in your own to make things work (and from my standpoint, thats a good thing! ). Bottomline...this is a good movie, If you are pursuing a good drama, pick this up."
4,You're not alone...a good movie,"If you like this genre of movie---romantic comedy, family drama type [Grand Canyon, One Fine Day, Parenthood etc.]...than you will enjoy this movie. It is a favorite of mine. I'd rate it 4.5 stars. I've read some reviews that were critical of the performances. I don't agree. The stars and the cast did a terrific job.My favorite part is the end...I can watch it over and over.Marriage isn't easy...and you don't get nominated for Best Marriage of the Year...unlike BEST COUPLE at your senior prom. But it is beautiful too. I love the moments highlights...those shared points the two of you cherish.And to love your kids..and want what's best for them...demands the best you can offer them in your marriage. Maybe you can't make it...but this movie makes the point: Don't give up easily...cause there's a lot to lose.Standtall"
4,Very Realistic; Funny in Parts!,"This movie explores a ""floundering"" marriage; a typical Hollywood cliche, but always popular, nonethless. The main argument between the couple is that Pfeiffer's character is too controlling, and has lost her sense of ""fun,"" whereas Willis's character is too irresponsible, (thereby rendering his over-taxed wife the ""designated driver"" in their marriage). There are many flashbacks throughout the film, spotlighting the couple's ""history"" - like their wedding, birth of their two children, moments of passion, various other fights, (yes, there are lOTS of fights in this movie!), etc... All in all, I'd say this is a good ""dialogue"" type film; very watchable, (if a bit ""sappy"" at the end). Definitely will be more interesting to those who have been married a while, with kids!"
4,Real life,"If you're about to divorce, watch this movie!If you're about to divorce, don't watch this movie!"
3,Typical 90's Marriage,"The Story of Us is a movie about Ben (Willis) and Katie (Pfeiffer) Jordan's failing marriage. Ben is still irresponsible and Katie too self-absorbed, after 15 years' of marriage. Throughout the movie Ben and Katie talk about the problems and reasons why their marriage is falling apart. The movie consisted of subplots and flashbacks of their marriage, children, marriage counselor's, fights, and conversations with friends. Ben wants the marriage to work; however he feels Katie blames him for all the problems and Katie's stubborness doesn't help.I had mixed feelings about this movie. Me and wife felt some connection with the characters. Some parts of the movie are very emotional and real. The movie is typical of today's marriage woes: too much work and not enough time. I found both characters at times annoying and self-centered. The ending was sappy and predictable. Rent before you buy....."
1,What a waste of money!,"I thought this movie would've been really good because of the caliber of the stars involved (Pfeiffer & Willis). But I was sadly mistaken. The movie was awful. Not only was it long and boring - but extremely profain! There was no need for the profanity used in this film! It was a great disappointment. Don't waste your time seeing this movie, folks!"
4,"Purple, not pink..","This duvet cover is very nice, especially for the price. My only disappointment was I thought it would be pink and white - but that's the sheet set (in the picture). That little strip of purple with penguins is what this looks like, and it's not a very pretty purple. Had I realized, I would have purchased the blue penguin set,Pike Street 135-Gram Printed Flannel Twin Duvet Cover, Peter Penguin, since that is more wintery looking. But, overall the quality is good."
5,Powerful,"I enjoyed this book immensely. The Dark Beyond The Stars made me think about what it means to have LIFE. This is a beautiful book whose ending brought tears to my eyes. It is a book not just about life, but also about death. I enjoyed the first person narration as well as the author's pacing and resolution. I love books that make you think and this was one whose primary question I will think about perhaps for the rest of my life. The Dark Beyond The Stars made an impact on me and I think that any authors greatest achievement. Simply a powerful novel. It is ashame that works like this share the same genre with campy sciece fiction ""thrillers"". Robinson's Sparrow was as good for me as Zelazny's Corwin (Amber) or Wolfe's Severian (Shadow). The story stays with Sparrow and never drifts so you can latch onto Sparrow and enjoy the read."
2,Personally don't care for ...,The scrolls are not as well made as I had hoped for and are very difficult to work with when inserting fabric. Much prefer the scrolls that use Velcro.
1,These Are Terrible!,"The rails do not fit the side bars! Either the holes in the side bars, where the rails are supposed to go into, are too big or too small. Don't buy these. They are junk."
5,Sub.Bionic Entertains!,"I love this disc. I recently made a 60-disc purchase from Amazon, and over 4 months of digestion of the material, I have come to appreciate this CD as the single greatest stand-out. The song-writing and production are the highlights, but there really is no weakness in this package. A worthy addition to my best-of collection."
1,Picking and choosing from cultures,"Originally published in 1960, this book is not particularly about Cuna mythology or cosmology. Instead, the author gathers bits and pieces of information from various cultures to support the theory that there is a universal story: creation, the flood, and onward, in all cultures. Although he visited with Cuna over 7 years, he repeatedly talks about ""primitive cultures"" as opposed to ""civilized cultures"". A paragraph may cite 3 or 4 disparate cultures. Descriptions of creation myths repeatedly refer to ""onamism"". Keeler's method of inquiry was to think of a feature from some other culture's mytholgy, and ask a shaman if there was anything similar in Cuna beliefs - not a method to provoke an unbiased result."
4,An excellent Rainbow best of,"This is another best of covering all the periods of one of the greatest bands ever. But in contrast to the previous (two) similar records; this one covers mostly the first period of the band the one when vocalist of the band was R. J. Dio. 6 of the tracks are from that period, including a Deep Purple song, mistreated, as was played in the record ""On Stage"". The rest 5 songs are the latest period of the band with R. Glover and L. Turner as vocalists. I really felt that the first period of the band was its greatest one; but you can't stop wondering that some songs such as ""Spotlight kid"", ""Eyes of the world"" are missing. Overall this record is for the band fans and collectors, such as myself, and to anyone who hasn't the faintest idea about Rainbow. I suggest you buy the following albums:i)Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, ii)Rainbow Rising iii)Long Live Rock'n'Roll iv)Down to Earth v)Difficult to Cure"
3,Rainbow is Rainbow,"OK, may be some regular albums by Rainbow are better than this selection, but it's still a pretty decent one. It's definitely a good piece of music that may be recommended for getting familiarized with the band. For those who know Rainbow's music well, it may be of less value and interest. However, it's no doubt that Rainbow is a great band whose musical efforts are still to be appreciated by true rock music fans."
1,Irrelevant and ad hominem attacks,"Rossing engages in irrelevant and ad hominem attacks. She has not interacted with, or even significantly referenced, serious dispensational scholarship. The author is entitled to her views but that entitlement does not give her a license to be less than accurate, painting an incomplete and unbalanced picture of dispensationalism. And it certainly does not give her the right to be dismissive, derisive, harsh, or censorious in her unfair criticism of dispensational theology. As one dispensational scholar once wrote: ""Normative dispensationalism is a legitimate, worthy, and conservative viewpoint. Other Christians do not have to agree with it, but they should represent it fairly and treat its contributions with respect. This is simply a matter of Christian integrity and courtesy."" Unfortunately, Rossing misses the mark completely regarding both integrity and scholarship in this book."
1,I wouldn't read this book,"If you want to be deceived and left hopeless, then listen to this author and read her book. If you are looking forward to meeting your creator and going to be with Jesus ""in the air' then, study the bible for yourself. You can use Tim LaHaye's book ""understanding the last days""... decide for yourself and what the WORD of GOD says."
1,Trust the Bible not man's word.,"The pre-tribulation rapture can easily be boiled down to one easy to understand argument: There just simple cannot be a rapture surprise if you know it's coming at the mid point, pre-wrath, or end of the tribulation. ""For this reason you be ready too; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will"" (Matthew 24:44).In order for it to be a surprise, the rapture must take place before the tribulation starts. It would absolutely silly to apply this to any other view. During the final hour of the tribulation, 2/3 of mankind will be dead from the various judgments and the Church will be under constant threat from the Antichrist. In all this carnage, I can not imagine believers being oblivious to the nearness of the Lord's return. This is why a pre-trib rapture is the only position that makes sense.The author of this book tries to lead us down a conspiracy bunnytail."
4,Good Record,"First of all, for those of you taking the liner notes so seriously. Did you ever think that maybe they were written ""tounge in Cheek"".Every RFTC record has been different so it is very tough to compare one to another. I feel that this record is good, but I do agree with some of the other reviews that it seems short and maybe a bit rushed. I also can see an influence from the Sultans. I happen to think that is a good thing. I like the way the record flows and sounds. I think that Speedos voice sound excellent on this recording as well as the horn section.I hope this record does well."
3,Not as bad as they say...,"After B.R. the survivers set up an army against all adults. The next B.R. game is for a class to go kill them. Who do you root for? Justice, or the people who had no choice? Tough one eh? well be sure it's set to make for some good viewing. Not as good as number one but better than the reviews from other places say it is. Some great gun fights and some great scenes with the old exploding necklaces. So, in my opinion, rent, if you can, before you buy. Enjoy!"
3,BURY THE COFFEE ;-(,EVEN THOUGH CRANBERRIES IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS I MUST SAY THIS: THE MUSIC IS GOOD BUT LYRICS ARE ANNOYING AND SHALLOW. BURY THE HATCHET IS FAR MORE SUBSTANTIAL. IT SEEMS THIS CD IS FOCUS ON TEENAGERS...SORRY...
3,Comes WITHOUT a bulb.,"I'd guess it is to make this light appear cheaper than it actually is. The bulb cost an extra $ 22.00 with shipping so this is SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive that it appears. But even the added cost is not what gets me the most. It is that after anxiously waiting to use the light I had to find, order and wait another week to use it. AND after looking over the description I found no statement that this was sold WITHOUT a bulb.I like the light but do not like the way it is sold.Crappy thing to do to first time customers."
2,A Disappointing Monitor,"My Samsung SyncMaster 940BX computer monitor is about 3 years old. It was repaired twice under warranty and now it has failed for the third time. Unfortunately, the warranty expired in January and the cost to repair it is about $80, which doesn't seem worth it given the history of this monitor. For a cost of $240, I expected a high quality, reliable product, but instead it turned out to be low quality and unreliable. I just wanted to let you know what a disappointment this monitor was, especially given that it was well reviewed by Consumer Reports and customers at newegg.com."
5,Fifteen Songs About Rain,"The Gary Allan Greatest Hits CD is excellent! This 15-track compilation includes wonderful music from Gary's impressive 12-year career. The songs artfully capture the highest highs and the lowest lows in the life of one of country music's most beloved singers. In addition, Gary has included two new songs, A Feelin' Like That & As The Crow Flies, giving us a glimpse of the powerful music that is still to come. Once you purchase this outstanding CD, you'll find that Gary's body of work is made up of a heart that is pure country without ever being hokey and bones that are no-nonsense rock & roll. Buy the record and attend a Gary Allan concert and you'll immediately be a part of Gary's everlasting legion of fans."
2,Not the best choice,"This phrasebook lacks basic information about China and overall is not the best one. Lonely Planet China book is fantastic and gives you a guide to travel with but forget this phrasebook. I found it to have many obscure phrases and not much actual Chinese. I recommend getting a phrasebook with the written Chinese characters because pinyin can sometimes be difficult for Chinese people to read and having the characters will definitely help when asking for directions, help, and ordering food. In my opinion get Barron's mandarin phrasebook by Wu and Hoss and don't waste your time on the Lonely Planet Phrasebook."
1,Warning: No Pinyin,"I've always been a fan of Lonely Planet Phrasebooks, and had planned to buy this book as well. But I discovered (just in time, fortunately) that this book substitutes a poorly thought out phonetic system for Pinyin, the standard method for transliterating Mandarin Chinese into the Roman alphabet. Thanks Lonely Planet - you've figured out a way to make learning the hardest language in the world even more confusing and difficult!So if you need a phrasebook for Mandarin, either buy the previous edition of this book or wait till the next edition, when hopefully the editors of Lonely Planet will replace this ill-informed author and rescue what had been, up to now, a really great series."
1,silly pronunciation system,"Lonely Planet books usually deserve rave reviews. Their Mandarin Phrasebook, however, uses a system of pronunciation that is much more confusing than helpful. The tragedy is that Mandarin already has a very workable western-script pronunciation system called ""pinyin."" Pinyin doesn't take long to learn and is very standard in Mandarin Chinese dictionaries and textbooks. A traveler looking to buy a useful phrasebook will be much happier with a standard pinyin phrasebook. ."
3,Scary Toy!!,"My daughter is terrafied of this toy.The only thing I can figure is that the head moves up and down and it looks like the head is going inside of the body .She will not come near it.In my opinion they are sort of cute but are just another take on the telletubies,which I don't like.I prefer more educational toys and in their shows they all use ""baby talk"" and I cannot see how this helps children at all.I have always been told that you shouldn't use baby talk around small children unless you want them to talk like a baby.I would not reccomend this toy,unless your child is a die hard fan,and I know if it is something that your kids really want you will probably end up buying it so as not to dissapoint them.I have done this lots of times myself and it is usually worth it to see the look of joy on their face(even if it dosen't last)."
1,Book filled with lies and outrageous histroical distortions,"Islam is what muslims believe to be so, what do you expect from non muslim and well known hater and Islamophone !This book is simply a pathetic attempt from a person filled with hate and anger to defame Islam.I advice all readers to get hold of the quran and read it for themselves, and then and only then they can judge for themselves.P.S. THE WORD SWORD WAS NEVER EVER MENTIOND IN THE QURAN, WHILE IT WAS MENTIONED MORE THAN 475 TIME IN THE BIBLE !!"
1,BUNCH OF LIES AND MISINFORMATION,"FIRST OF ALL YOU CAN NOT MAKE ANY CLAIMS ABOUT ISLAM ,QURAN AND MUHAMMAD PBUH IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SCHOLARLY KNOWLEDGE OF ARABIC BEAUSE EVEN THE WRONG RECITATION WRONG INTERPRETATION OF ARABIC WORDS CAN SIMPLY CHANGE THE ENTIRE MEANING AND THIS IS WHAT THESE HATEMONGER AND BIASED WRITERS HAVE DONE TO GIVE THEIR OWN MEANINGS TO THESE VERSES TO SUIT AND FIT INTO THEIR AGENDA OF SMEARING A PEACEFUL RELIGION WHICH IS PRACTISED BY ONE THIRD OF THE WORLD POPULATION. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH READ THE BOOK ""THE LIES ABOUT MUHAMMAD BY MOUSTAFA ZAYED"" WHO HAVE EXPOSED THE LIES TOLD BY ROBERT SPENCER ....maY GOD GUIDE ROBERT SPENCER TO TRUTH AMEN"
4,Apologies,"Sirs/Ma'ams, I've just returned from some travel, and have not yet been able to start reading this book. However, all of the reviews that I've previously read - and which were the primary reason for my purchasing this book - were very much positive."
3,Politically Incorrect Guilde,"Another insite in the Crusades.and the war with Islam. I did not understand about it being politically incorrect, if the author was accurate in his writings."
5,Muslims are the true enemy of all gays and lesbians,"The books is frightful. You know why most gays and lesbians support Muslims. We have this stupid logic that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Basically, Muslims don't like Christians and we gays support muslims who dislike gays.We are stupid. Gays will be destroyed by the Muslims. That is a fact. The Taliban celebrated when gays were killed when a wall was pushed down on them.If America was smart they would pass an ammendment allowing the Federal Government to deport the followers of Islam and their teachers. If we don't do this then in 20 years this nation will be under a Muslim dictatorship."
1,an offensive book for all Muslims including myself,"who does the author think he is? How dare he accuse my religion and my Prophet? How would he have liked a similar book written about Christianity? Shame on you, Robert Spencer!!!!"
1,Garbage,"This book is pure rubbish. It generalizes and stereotypes Muslims based on the extreme minority of Muslim extremists. Unfortunately, the author is as much of a hate mongerer as the very people he ends up condemning."
1,"""non believers"" does not mean christians or jews or buddists","As it has been mentioned in several previous reviews and in encyclopedia, the term non believers refers to the Arabic word in Quran, Kafirs. Kafir litearlly means to cover/hide something.Furthermore, to fully understand Quran you must read the entire Holy Book, not just one chapter or one verse and then you will understand its context and time."
4,Must Read,This book is a definite must read if you want to understand what is going on inside Islam.
4,Important Insites,I found the book to be very entertaining and informative. I particularly enjoyed the insights of such intellects such as Churchill and de Tocqueville.
4,Deus Vult,Very informative presentation which seeks to unmask Islam and to show that radical Islam and Islam are the same.The moderate muslims are the heretics
5,the politically incorrect guide to islam,excellent book for all to read. what we should know about islam is in this book with pages that are well documentated. should be read by every american who cares about their freedom.
1,Not accurate,"This book obviously has an agenda. The ""facts"" that it represents are absolutely incorrect. He takes quotes out of context, gets stories completely wrong, makes up quotes and plays upon the fears of certain people. If you would like to read a great book about Islam, try Understanding Islam by CTR HewerUnderstanding Islam: An Introduction. He is an American and a Christian and uses real facts and quotations."
1,Mr. Kaleem's Review says everything.,"After reading Kaleem's review about this book, it is clear it is rubbish and only crazy will buy this book.There is one star at default, I would not even give one star to this book."
5,For Islamic apologist..get a brain,Hii can't believe the negative reviews...one idiot{yes idiot} actually claims that Islam is more tolerant that christianity.. even talks about how tolerant Islamic spain was..thats and out and out lie. i guess Mohammed raping 9 year old girls is Islamic Law at it's finest........the religion is totally evil and satanic in every way..and yes i am a christian ..but not a fundlementalist so don't gripe about that.....Islam's history of persecution says it all..
4,Why We Fight,This book reveals the agenda of Islam to subjugate the entire world. The point is that there is no radical Islam. All true believers intend to enslave all who are not followers. The picture painted is very dark and leaves one with the feeling that we must defeat all Moslems except those who sunscribe to a reformed Islamic faith. I really liked the book and felt that I have a better understanding of why someone would blow themsleves up along with many innocent people. I now see the need to fight our war on terrorism to the end.
4,Lots of quotes from the Koran,This book is based on history and on dozens of quotes from the Koran. I was surprised at the number of Koran passages that encourage murder and torture and hatred. The book also shows that Islam has been spread from the very beginning by waging war. The book also shows that the Crusades were a reaction to a war against Europe that had been going on for hundreds of years. It is well written and provides a fascinating look into Islam.
5,Tells it like it is...,"Great book....Buy it, read it, tell your friends about it. If more liberals read this book, they might start supporting our troops and the war we are in against these religious fanatics."
1,Not worth the paper it's written on,"Robert Spencer is clearly against everything Islamic. You can look up his earlier books and websites where his fellow follower are calling for the killing of Muslims and desecration and abolition of the Holy Quran. If you are looking for the real and balance view on Islam, you won't find it here. He's cherry-picking random versers from the Quran to prove his point. Using his methods you could make mother Mother Teresa like an agent of the devil. Trying to portray the crusaders as peaceful and purely defensive force is absurd especially since even Christian historians speak of their unspeakable crimes. The only reason this book was written is to incite hatred and to prevent any dialog between the faiths."
1,Anyone can write a book,This book proves that anyone can write a book and get it published. I bought this book for a book group that discusses timely topics with an emphasis on Jewish or related matters. Some of what the author relates is true but his writing style is so slanted and sarcastic that every person in the group disliked it. The editing of the book was also poor. There are errors throughout. One example that could easily have been checked is the Temple Mount not Mound as was stated a few times in the book. This was a waste of time to read and discuss. We could have read other books (and will) that would have given us the information in a better and more concise manner without the radical right rhetoric.
1,Pull no punches,"Let's be perfectly honest.If you read this book and gave it 5 stars, there are only 1 of 3 options1) You are a bigot, your bigotry institutionalized by the hyper-right wing over the the last decade, and this book merely confirms all you believe2) You are ignorant and do not care enough to vet the author for obvious bias3) You know no Muslims.There are MANY MANY things wrong with Islamic doctrine, especially today, and the quality of religious instruction in the Muslim world. This book does not address those, instead it simplifies and demeans an entire religion.One last point. If Spencer was right, believe me you wouldn't have the luxury of typing from your keyboard. There are 1 billion Muslims and if they all went to war as per the Crusades......"
1,Historical revisionism.,"On the cover, this text states, ""the crusades were a defensive conflict"". The information in the text does not sufficiently back up this claim. If you do not want to pay alot for this book, buy ""the Myth of Islamic Tollorence"" as it is the same book in a different format. jay."
1,Propaganda written in a hateful tone,"As I read through the book, it became clear that this was much more of an opinion piece (someone's opinion) than an academic book of fact. Through-out the book there were extreme emotional opinions such as ""he lied"", ""his insatiable lusts"", ""licentiousness, cruelty, and ruthless ambition"", ""much-ballyhooed (and grossly exaggerated)"". Much of the content (as exemplified by these 'extreme' words appears to be written by someone with hatred toward Islam. This book therefore, appears to be nothing more than propaganda against Islam."
2,Pullllleze.,"Sure, the OC soundtrack has mostly good songs by many, many renowned indie artists and bands, but what do they REALLY have to do with the OC? If you think about it, this is just another ploy to strip people of money by linking actual cool music that has been around for years to a new and ""hip"" TV show. They have nothing to do with each other."
1,"this ""O.C."" isn't looking good","Hey, I am a really big fan of the show ""THE O.C"" and when I watched the final episode of the first season I knew I was going to miss it. I decided to purchase the CD, and when I did...well, to be honest...I hated it. The only good song on the whole soundtrack is ""California"", which most people know by the theme song. As much as I love the show and can't wait until the next season don't bother buying this CD. It is a waste."
4,This CD is awesome!,"OK...First of all, E.Royal needs to chill. I'm embarassed to say that I'm also from Memphis. Trust me- not everyone here is that stuck-up. Now to the CD- This CD was bought out of impulse and proved to be worth the small price. I was a bit discouraged because it didn't have as many songs as I wanted it to, but it was still a great CD. I have to say that the last song ""California"" by Phantom Planet is definately addictive. Everytime I watch The OC, I hear that song, and it's great to finally have it on CD! By the way...did everyone catch the season finale tonight? WOW...I'm definately looking forward to next season! Hope this review helped a bit! :o)"
5,Peppy songs for the whole family,"This CD is chock full of easy to learn songs with great beats. My 2-yr old grandson requests it when driving in the car. I have my favorites too! Great variety of fast, slow, soft, loud."
2,the movie will be great but I can't reccomend this book,"Let me start by saying I am an art student and I only buy these ""Art of"" books to learn to learn from them. The Art of the Incredibles was a INCREDIBLE let down. This has to be some of ther worse preproduction art I have ever seen. Of the 3 ""Art of"" Pixar books, this is definitely the worse."
2,Great method. Poor content.,"The method is great. Listening, then speaking, but for someone like myself with absolutely no French (ie a beginner)the content was inappropriate. I am planning a trip to France later this year. I still don't know any basic vocabulary, how to introduce myself. How to ask for directions, the bank, everyday stuff like that.On a positive note, I thought , hey, this is what I need for Spanish. I did very well in high school Spanish but have never been comfortable trying to speak. This method actually gets you speaking right away. So with a solid vocabulary in Spanish and a knowledge of grammer, I expect Smart Spanish to get me speaking."
3,Depends on what you want if for,"I believe this item is ok if you already know good French reasonably well, especially the accent. I believe that anyone studying any language should first learn quality language before learning street language. For example, if one is from China, it is best to study good English first, such as is spoken by the educated class, such as people at ivy leage schools, before learning English as spoken by common people is southern GA or TX. This French course is for people who already know French as spoken by cultured or educated people, and want to better understand French as spoken on the street in fast conversation."
3,OK,"Since the only time that I can study is when I drive, this CD was not for me... because it was necessary to sometimes look at the book so I could understant the words that was said in french accent."
2,Not so easy,"I am studying French language at the local college and based on what other reviewers stated I thought this would be very good.I did learn to count to 100 very quickly, however, I thought this would teach me the french words along with the english meaning. Instead it goes into conversations in French and hardly any translations,they focus on pronunciation, which really is no help to me at this stage. I need to learn the french word and then the english meaning.If you have basic high school French then this would probably be the method for you, however, if your like me and have no idea then this I would have to say is not the method."
2,Not so smart,"If all you want is a CD that makes you repeat over & over again words & phrases then this is for you - otherwise it is not a good starter course. I already know 5 languages and thought this would help out, but it is pretty much a waste of time & money. Sorry"
1,A big disappointment,"Like the other reviewers, I picked this up because I really, really liked the Company. October Circle, however, was written a quarter century earlier, and Littell definitely used the time between to improve his writing style. The first half of the book drags miserably, and the collection of oddball characters - the Racer, the Magician, the Dwarf, the Flag Holder - do not make the book more interesting. I rarely don't finish a book, but it was all I could do to keep myself reading in this case."
2,Lack of moral standpoint disgusting,"What turned me off this book was that not only did it fail to portray the horror of Communist tyrrany, as I thought it would ,but it glorifies a bunch of degenerates without a hint of dissaproval by the author of their intellectual dishonesty, or even of the cruel exploitation of children by the hateful dwarf.The style of writing was however good and that is why I will give it two stars instead of one"
4,Fun to do!,"This book has a lot of good ideas on things to do with your child. I had a number of books that were for older kids and the stuff just wasn't applicable to the age group I was dealing with. When I first read this, a lot of the stuff was still a little past my sons abilities, but as he's gotten older and -MUCH- more mobile, these ideas are perfect.If you're struggling trying to find things to do with your child(ren) grab a copy and have a blast!"
4,What a great book!,"Baby Days is a wonderful book.This book is packed full of activities,games,crafts and make your own toys I never would have thought of!And so easy. The book is broken up into sections to carry you through the day: morning,noon and night.There is even a ""parent's only"" section for baby's naptime. I loved this book and use ideas from it on a daily basis!"
5,Loving the Little Box,I love the Little Box of Scraves and Hats. It came quickly and that patterns are easy to follow. I recommend this to anyone who is a newer crocheter!
3,Remember as a kid....ok,"Brings back some memories, interesting show. Unfortunately the Olympic theme is great for a show or two but after that it is a lot of the same which gets a little old. Kids liked but had same feeling. Who is this for...the scooby fanatic that wants them all. Who's it not for....someone who wants good entertainment cartoons"
2,Online Companion Service Unavailable for Anything Over Grade 5,"A good part of my purchase of this book was the fact that there was supposed to be an online site with help and activities to go along with the assignments in the workbook. However, AFTER the purchase of the book I tried to register for that service. I was told that they no longer offer online services for any of their workbooks that go beyond the 5Th grade.I give stars for the work pages themselves, but with little to no help in the actual activity book for a student that is having trouble with the assignments, and the elimination of the online help feature, the usefulness of this book is in serious question."
1,Not stable and sturdy at all!,"This thing was difficult to put together and the wood split. It doesn't hold, it is really flimsy and falling apart. You cannot take the fabric off to wash it unless to unscrew everything and take it completely apart. I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,facial brush,The brush is pretty and has a nice handle but the bristles are a little to soft to slough off even the loosest of dead skin.
5,Very effective!!!,I've been doing Taebo dvds since 2003. i finally decided to try this dvd. best $20 i invested. her workout is very effective. No offense to taebo but she doesnt spend alot of time talking. she gives excellent instructions very you move on to the next move. its at a comfortable pace and her reps are even. im getting ready to order her other Dvd. im an advanced exercise workout 5x a week and 2 of the days i use her dvd. each time i be sweating like i came out of a pool. 5 stars.......
4,"Interesting, but....","I say interesting because it is, Ilaria's bodystrikes dvd it's very hardcore and can wore a person out because of the reps you have to do. Though it will help tone and reshape your body, I have a couple of issues with this dvd. For one, the warm up is a tad too long, if you didn't know any better you thought the warm-up was the exercise till later on when she cues you for the ""official"" workout, the second problem is that she does make you do a lot of squats and side kicks. Which for the most part i have no problem with, except that the hip flexors and quads takes a beating. If you not good with technique and doing it fast but in control movements this dvd is definitely not for you. And in all do honesty, no beginner should ever use any of ilaria's exercises. You end up hurting you self more than actually helping yourself. But regardless of these factors, this was a superb exercise dvd. Definitely recommended."
4,"Rubbermaid, can't go wrong",As usual you can't go wrong with Rubbermaid. Items are long lasting and attractive.
3,Opens your eyes to the trees around you,"Another handy reference for amateur naturalists, this pocket book facilitates the identification and exploration of trees of all sorts.There is some introductory information in the beginning that brings the reader up to speed on how trees work, and also suggests some strategies and uses for tree identification.Some of the pictures are the soft colors that we have come to expect, but many of the pictures of leaves and nuts are more starkly drawn, perhaps because identification can be so difficult.Trees are arranged by group (spruces, oaks, etc.), and each species has a picture, short description, and map depicting its natural range.This is an invaluable book for amateurs, and has the Golden Guide trademark of being accessible to young naturalists without talking down to them."
5,Great Book,"I read this book a long time ago, and consider it one of the best I've ever read. Maybe it's not absolutely historically accurate (it's not supposed to be), but it evokes for me an era long before I existed, and the spirit of what those times must have been like. There are at least two other books out there that are historically researched and accurate, but leave the emotion out. You need to read them together to get the true picture.Does anyone know anything more about Ralph Berton, who, without intending it, is really the most interesting character in the book?"
5,Read this book!!,"What a great portrait of a great age in AMerica. Ralph Berton was a fabulous aurthur. I read this book in four days, couldn't put it down, I dreamt about Bix's music for weeks on end."
3,A Lesser Sellers Effort,"An entertaining cops and robbers yarn, however, if you are looking for Peter Sellers in his full comic range don't look here. It appears that he is passing the time until ""Dr. Strangelove came his way. That said, Sellers fans who are familiar with his greater work will be entertained by this lesser endeavor."
5,Enjoyed,"Yes I am a Ryan Reynolds fan, but I also enjoyed the plot, it fit the bill for entertainment purposes."
2,No surprises,"If you've seen any quality heist movies, then this will seem extremely predictable. But keep in mind that it's free. The acting is okay to not so good. The lack of quality only helps in making apparent what the plot twists will be. There are a few moments that will leave you shaking your head, ut it is a movie and not real life. This is on the order of quality of made for TV fare like leverage and Hustle. It won't win any Academy Awards (or even Golden Globes for that matter), but as a free film, it's not the worst way to spend some time."
4,Surprisingly Interesting and Enjoyable.,"We like to watch thinking movies; that is, something you can logically follow and try to resolve on your own. This movie opened rather slowly, but soon picked up the pace.Three people who like to solve logistical puzzles plan a theoretical heist of a jewelry wholesaler. Things go terribly awry when someone steals their plans and executes the robbery. From there, their lives go into turmoil.I won't go too much into the story as it is very twisted and has a very surprising end; one which we didn't see coming and which was very satisfying.Rather along the lines of ""Inside Man"", although not quite as well done.Very enjoyable."
3,Enjoyable,"Foolproof was fun to watch. The plot concerns three would-be thieves enjoying a type of masquerade game creating heists that are Foolproof! Ha. Well, until a real master thief blackmails them into helping him with a real theft of bearer bonds. Then there is the planning, the practice, the double cross, the double double cross. It was fun. I'm surprised this movie was not better known. Though it was somewhat predictable, it might still hold a surprise or two depending on which scenario a viewer is inclined to expect."
4,A bit on the predictable side .. but entertaining ..,"The most appealing part of the movie (unlike) other heist movies, is the characters are not professional crooks, but just simulate their plans to perfection (a.k.a) foolproof .. That leads the movie into a bit of a grey area, where there is apparently no intention to commit the crime, but yet the method and plan is perfected. Interesting!!The plot however unwinds as it goes on, and starts becoming a bit predictable. But good performances delivered all around.Would recommend for a one time watch."
2,Amateur Hour,"I didn't make it very far into this movie. This is a true B movie - paper thin characters, marginal acting & a ridiculous plot. If you can watch it for free via amazon prime it might be worth it, but I certainly wouldn't pay to watch."
2,Cheap Plastic that simply isnt worth the price.,"I really thought that people were overstating just how bad this thing is. I wish I would have listened. It really is just a piece of cheap plastic with some black and chrome paint, the double sided tape used to affix it to the car is kind of small was not placed in the middle so the left noodles are visibly apart from the car and I'm worried will pose a tempting target for someone bored and/or stupid enough to rip it off."
2,spaghetti monster,This is expensive for a piece of plastic with a little sticky stuff on the back. I got a response from the seller asking what they could do to let me know just exactly what the product was composed of. They told me that bad reviews hurt their ratings. The product was described accurately -- but I think adding that it's an overpriced but cute piece of junk that would work better stuck on a refridgerator might help.
2,"Great device, pathetic wi-fi reception","I was very excited to get this for X-mas last year, but instantly became disappointed when I was unable to get a wireless wi-fi connection outside of the room with my router. All of the other wi-fi devices in our house connect well, especially with the Linksys booster in the kitchen, but not the Soundbridge. I have given up on wireless, and am now trying to figure out how to directly link it to our stereo, which is currently far away from the router. On the plus side, the configuration and controls are great when it does connect, but this unfortunately doesn't help me. Beware of this device if your goal is a wireless connection across any distance."
2,I see dead Rokus,"My M1000 had been a reliable music streamer for several years, until we came home from vacation last week to find the display dark and the SoundBridge completely unresponsive. Checking in on Roku's online forum, I found that many, many other SoundBridge owners have had ""dead"" Rokus. Looks like the consensus is that the SoundBridges were engineered with inadequate ventilation and/or that they used underrated capacitors that overheated and failed.Roku has not reponded to my request for advice on how to repair my SoundBridge, despite their customer service page pledge to respond within 48 hours. Looks like I'm out of luck.After this experience - poor quality and poor support - I'm very disinclined to purchase another Roku product of any kind. The Roku HD movie player looks like an attractive option for accessing video, but having been burned once, I'm just not willing to give this company another chance."
1,double feature garbage here...,"not very entertaining; both shows are dumb. not enough action on either film. the pod movie was weird & ill in addition to above analysis. the other film-also bad were the giant mantis' or grasshoppers, i cant remember currently what they were, were fake metal props. i got rid of this dvd since it makes one feel depressed."
4,I hear you and I understand you!,"I have studied french grammar and memorized french vocabulary. But until SmartFrench, I often found carrying on a conversation with french people difficult and understanding french movies and TV, almost impossible. Then I discovered SmartFrench. This CD program focuses on two important, but often ignored aspects of learning the french language: pronunciation and aural comprehension. On these two areas, SmartFrench is outstanding. It begins by discussing the alphabet and french sounds and then painstakingly walks you through interviews with real french people. You hear the interviews read, you pronounce the words, you pay attention to the rhythm of the language and the patterns of speech. You read the text and then you hear the actual interview. As the program progresses, your ability to listen, to hear and to understand improves. I highly recommend this program to people who want to challenge themselves to actually speak and understand the french language."
5,Supberb album,"It a classic Beatles album that sounds great, I am glad that the records are available again, kinda cool listening to vinyl records again, love it and recommend to all Beatle enthusiast,"
2,Why Did I Finish This?,"Author Jack Dubrul, who penned an endorsement on the front of this book, should be thumped for comparing this book to Dan Brown's work. The premise is interesting: a four-hundred year old journal that may lead to a long-lost holy relic. The problem is that the story drags. Do not wait for it to get better, it doesn't. Run from this one."
3,"Exciting enough, but a total let down as a whole",There was a lot of research and history that went into the novel and I enjoyed how the story was told through the journal of the young boy. That made things exciting and kept me turning the pages. Other than that the plot is lacking and kind of confusing. Honestly a lot of things didn't add up and I was left with too many questions...
3,Fun Read But Terrible Ending,"This book was really interesting with all the information about ships, astronomy and religious icons. It starts off really well but the ending seems a bit shallow and boring. Gee...now that we've survived all these horrible things, lets rush out and buy stuff! It would have been a better read if the main characters had developed more depth by the end of the book."
1,Ablaze,"I actually have been doing a continous report on spontaneous human combustion and came across this book while looking for information. Do you seriously think a school bus driver will have any scientific information? His facts were either made up to his liking or none existant. If you want to believe in something you will do everything you can to make it true. In this book, that is what Larry E. Arnold did. If you're looking for simple entertainment this book will work fine but if you want the truth or something vaguely similar this book is not worth your time."
5,chapter 12 is unbelieveable,Rhodes Scholar Scott Hershovitz really hits home with his essay. He is brilliant.
2,"starts with a bang, but fizzles . . .","I thought Bodyguard had a dynamite beginning, but it never really lived up to it. The heroine didn't engage my sympathy or my empathy. She seemed much more of a caricature than other heroines by the same author. I liked the hero, but the rumpled suit bit kept reminding me of Peter Falk, and I just couldn't drum up much interest. All in all the plot moved very slowly and I got bored."
2,"Uninspired, Unpleasant, and Downright Dull","I usually enjoy Suzanne Brockmann, but I'm afraid this book was a chore to get through. Disfunctional characters, mediocre plot, and boring dialogue-- who wants to read about such things when we experience them every day in real life?The two main characters were flat and never seemed to come alive, though the Harry was marginally better-drawn than Allie. (The sub-plot with George and his women was outright distasteful. I hope that Ms. Brockmann is not intending to write a spin-off with this crew-- they are very unattractive.)I was actually relieved whenever the main storyline was interrupted and we had a glimpse of the teenager Shaun: he was the most appealing of the bunch.Anyway, I'm sorry to say that this is the worst Suzanne Brockmann I've ever read. Try one of her other books if you want something at all engaging."
1,Waste of Money,"I found this book dull, and had no familar elements of romance (perhaps is wasn't suppose to be a romance?). If I want to reads a mystery I would go to the mystery section and get a mystery book. The book was slow paced, next time I will check it out of the library before spending money on a book like this."
4,Excellent TV and Price,This is a excellent buy. I received the TV in 5 days. Everything was in mint condition. I am very pleased with this TV. It is wonderful in my room and compliments my taste. Phillips Magnavox does live up to its reputation. Looking for a good TV at a good price. My advice is buy this one and be as pleased as I am. Enjoy...
4,A great TV at a great price,"I bought this television to use in my study. While this model may not have all the bells and whistles others have, it has proven to be a great product and at such a great price it is a rare find. It is very easy to use and projects a very clear and crisp picture. I would reccomend this TV to anyone looking for a quality product at a fair price."
5,"Nothing is all things to all people, but this is close!","This is a combination of lovely presentation, beautiful models (using both male and female verifies the true artistic intent), and great user interface.... There are lots of reviews listed - many people seem to want it to be a replacement for a live human and it can never be. It IS an inspiration, a motivator, a help, and a lovely, soothing method for practice on your own terms. Bravo to the author, photographer, and models..."
3,The fabulous Barbara Stanwyck steals the show!,"The movie seems to be trying to shock us with its portrayal of a New Orleans whorehouse (and maybe it *was* shocking back then). But, viewed now, there isn't much of interest here. The acting is generally only just passable (and sometimes downright embarrassing--get a load of Anne Baxter as the Mexican woman!). HOWEVER, Barbara Stanwyck's terrific portrayal of the madam makes up for a lot of that. As usual, she steals every scene that she's in, giving such a forceful and convincing performance that you can't take your eyes off of her. She makes the picture worth at least a rental."
5,"""The Greatness Of Hayley Mills""","""Summer Magic"" is another classic for all you Hayley Millsfans! This time she plays Nancy Carey in this tale of greatness andcourage. When the Careys don't have any money to stay in Boston, theirteenage daughter Nancy finds a way. They move into The Yellow House inBeullah,Maine where they meet Osh Popham (Burl Ives). Things couldn'tget any worse until Julia (Deborah Walley) comes for a visit. Richardand Robert Sherman helps Miss Mills again with delightful songs. Thisis a great movie for anybody!"
3,"Good movie, bad musical","Hayley Mills shows her charm once again in this young-adult classic, and if you're looking for family entertainment, this is a delightful story. The problem is that it's presented as a musical with songs that really add nothing to the story and are, quite frankly, dumb, especially ""Pink of Perfection"". The story itself is not as good as ""Pollyanna"" or ""The Parent Trap"" but entertaining nonetheless."
3,Works sometimes,This DVD will not work in my normal DVD player. It will only work in our portable player...weird. The movie is darling.
1,Corny,"This movie is very corny. It is also annoying. It is a little unrealistic that everything would work out so well for this family. It is horribly corny. It is unbelieveable because Hayley Mills has a British accent and her family does not. Burl Ives's role is also cheesy (what else is new), and the name of the dude who owns the house's name is stolen from the bass player is Aerosmith, Tom Hamilton. The movie glorifies old ideals, such as country being better than the city. U should stay away from this one. It is not worth a stinking penny."
5,The Science of Being,"Nowhere have I come across such a clear and accessible exposition of the fundamental principles of The Fourth Way as in the lectures and accompanying dialogues on this DVD. William Patrick Patterson explains the key practices of the teaching, self-remembering and self-observation, in a detailed manner that is not available in any Fourth Way book I have read, and I have read widely. Patterson actually leads the audience into an experience of themselves as they are and not as they imagine themselves to be, and then deeper into an experience of Consciousness itself. The third lecture, entitled The Science of Being, is a primer for anyone seriously interested in understanding the origins of Gurdjieff's Fourth Way, its relationship to world religions, and the uniqueness of its core teachings. I strongly recommend this video to anyone who wishes to experience the depth and richness of The Fourth Way."
2,Good reading but poor history.,"Horne who always makes history readable misses a little here with superficial analogies: Napoleon to Hitler and outstanding factual errors: storming of the Bastille in 1790, see pg. 37, which tend to make this a rather wobbly history. The battle descriptions, his forte, are excellent."
2,Not The Item Pictured,The product I received was not the same terminals shown in the description. The items pictured in the ad had better insulation which is why I ordered them. Be aware of this if you purchase this item.
3,Nice but weak,Have had this for For some time now it does a great job with whole chickens and prime ribs. Motor mount is a bit weak I have had placed a block of wood under the motor to keep the rod from falling out.
5,great brushes for the price.,"This pack of 3 brushes is a great deal. The brushes are decent quality and it was nice to get 3 in a pack so my son can leave one at school, home, and to carry around. Fast shipping too!"
2,over rated,"I expected much of this movie casue is in every List I have seen, but is kind of poorly acted, to make the exception of the rule, the mother of the alder makes a great performance, but C hris, need somethig else to convence"
3,Could have been a bit more realistic,"I geniunely wanted to love this film. The story line was intriguing, but the acting was mediocre and a lot of the dialogue was forced and artificial. A couple of scenes which were supposed draw you in emotionally were like bad high school plays. There was a nice, happy (albeit contrived) ending, but the movie just never convinced me that any of it was real. I'm not even interested in seeing the extras on this DVD."
5,Just a good movie,This is just a really good movie. I wouldn't recommend it to your conservative christian or anything but for anyone with an open mind and a love for good stories I highly recommend it!!
3,"Latter Days, latter video","This film was a pleasant and enjoyable entertainment made in the current video mode - balanced lighting, designed-and-decorated spaces, new-age characters in well resolved conflicts. It's not Brokeback Mountain, but it was enjoyable and satisfying"
2,A sticky wad of gay bubble gum,"Religious persecution by radical sects against gay people is a serious topic so I wish it had been covered by serious people. The script writers and the cast should have been used on a movie with a more shallow theme that needed less thought and concern put into it. I hope some day a competent and talented director revisits this topic and does a better job of handling it.Latter Days is a chick flick, except that in the place of overly hormonal young valley girls we have two gay kids, one of whom is totally hot, by the way. The only decent member of the cast was the actress who played the Mormon kid's mother. All the rest of the actors and actresses were horrible. The screen play was contrived - at times laughable and at times cringe-inducing. Most of the movie's attempts to create humor fall completely flat."
2,"A completely OK movie, nothing more","While it's nice to see that this movie affected some people, I found it to be predictable and disappointing. The main flaws: 1) I totally did not buy the relationship between the 'party boy' and the Mormon, and certainly didn't buy that they were in love, considering that they had probably only 4 scenes together before they professed their love for one another. 2) The characterization is inconsistent, especially with the Mormon. 3)The subplot with Jacqueline Bisset, while kind-of interesting, is handled awkwardly and ties in with the two characters in an eye-roll inducing manner. 4) I left the movie early, but I was able to predict the ending, which my friend confirmed for me. But this is just my opinion, my friend LOVED this movie."
5,Best Movie of the Year,"Forget classifying this as the best ""gay themed"" movie of the year. This truly is the best movie I have seen this year, and it being about 2 gay men has nothing to do with it. It is a beautiful love story about gorgeous party boy Christian and shy Mormon boy Aaron who fall in love. The 2 lead actors Steve Sandvoss and Wes Ramsey turn in two of the most compelling and honest performances of the year. Supporting performances are also wonderful, especially by Amber Benson, Jaquline Bissett, and Mary Kay Place. This film is funny, intense, heartbreaking, and romantic all at the same time. It had me in tears by the end. I absolutely loved this movie."
5,Must Reading If We are to Re Establish Leadership,"Lee Iacocca has hit the nail on the head. He has a true concept of what is wrong with America. There are a lot of great leaders out there. They are bogged down in government interfernce, apathy, and citizens who have lost their perspective on what is important. We have come to accept 2nd best in everthing including our leaders. Read the book and then communicate your displeasure with the current state of affairs. Most important question your leaders and VOTE!"
2,throw this bum out!,"Lee Iacocca (LI) was the product manager for the Ford Pinto. Somehow he dodged that disaster. Then, he went to Chrysler wherein 1978 he and the auto workers' union accepted billions from the US government. Chrysler today really doesn't exist even though Mercedes and then Cerebrus thought they could do something with it. The US government (again!) gave it ten billion dollars. Instead of the US auto union being part of the deal, it's the Italian auto union that has this ""dead horse."" Hmmm ... isn't Iacocca an Italian name? :-)Googling on Chrysler took me to [...] where you can see more information."
5,One of the greatest books from one of the greatest men,This book is a call to action. It provides a definition of a great leader from one of the greatest leader of all time. So rarely is there someone like Lee Iacocca and we need to treasure his words of wisdom. I would buy this book 10 times over.
3,Still passionate about America,"Iacocca's book tends to ramble across various issues of interest to him as he looks back over his life in business. The first chapter, however, is focused and to the point...our current administration is suffering from a complete lack of leadership and is causing great harm to our country and its prospects for the future.This is an easy and quick read that leaves you hopeful that leaders of the future can meet the challenges they will face IF they will face the challenges and not deficit spend them farther yet into the future."
5,Great Book!!!!,"Didn't close the book until it was finished. At his seasoned age, Iacocca is still sharp and spot on with the problems in the world Today"
3,Not what I expected.,I probably made the mistake thinking this was all about his years with Chrysler. I did not know he would get into political issues. Someone on the left might like it a lot.
5,Sucked me in.,"First off, if you are a blind Bush loyalist than this is not the book you are looking for. Lee takes no prisoners here and describes his anger and frustration with the previous presidential administration. He makes his opinions on hot topics very clear and provide alternate ways to handle each, all backed by his years of business leadership. If you have followed Lee through the years, then a lot of what you read will not be too new. Lee has always been the type to speak his mind and this book continues that trend.While this book is about a different administration, a lot of it's core remains relevant. I just reread my copy a couple weeks ago and many of the ideals and thought provoking questions he brings up will apply to the next presidential election, and for each successive one after it. If you allow yourself to look at the whole picture and not a tilted one-sided snapshot, then this book should provide you with plenty to think about."
5,Where Have All the Leaders Gone,"This book at first made me loose interest, but as I read on it made me laugh a lot in the first chapter as his truths just kept coming on stronger and stronger to where he (Lee Iacocca) just proved his rash statements about President Bush and how dumb Bush isAs a conservative its Ironic how this book is a great laugh with so many truths included. READ IT!! Bush as president has taken more vacations than any past president and shows how calious he is to the welfare of the nation!!"
1,Rantings of an Old Man...,"I find it hard to believe that this long time hero of mine has gone completely senile. Just how can you bash the government when they were the ones that guaranteed your loans and bought you time in order to turn around Chrysler? You became a hero because of them and the American public and this is how you pay them back? I thought a true leader was someone who not only fixed the problems but made the company a strong future as well? When a good leader leaves, the company should continue to grow? You can't blame him for selling to Daimler because you gave him nothing to work with. How can you only use political examples to show bad leadership when they abound in current day business? It appears that my hero, like Reagan and other heros I've cherished over the years, has prepared himself for the pasture. Please, Lee, go out in style. Not with these venomous ravings of a mad-man!"
3,Challenging to say the least,"Is it possible to like this trilogy in the traditional sense? I suppose if you are interested in war stories and warlike personalities, you may find more to like here than I did. True, Bakker's universe is rich and complicated and chock full of characters, many of which are incidental to the plot. So we can give him credit for creativity, originality and excellent descriptions. But I wonder if some readers' admiration for these books might not be because they managed to get through them at all. I found the third one to be more difficult than the first two. The last few chapters were too long and the ending was confusing and inconclusive. None of the characters is very likeable. I certainly didn't find myself thinking about the story after I'd finished reading it. I will read Bakker's future work just to see if things are clarified, but I may never be a fan."
2,What was everyone else reading?,"A little more then surprised that so many raving reviews were written for the last book in this series.I could not wait to get my hands on the last installment, and I am nothing short of stunned at the predictabilty and mundane dialog of this book.Also very dissappointed in how the book left off. I feel I invested much time in this series and was entilted to find out about the BIRDS secret (did not want to give anything away).Hopefully there will be another series telling the story of consult the NO-GOD and ACHAMIAN. Because frankly there needs to be way more payoff in book three. I actually started to wonder if BAKKER was just getting tired."
3,"Good, BUT",This Swivel Sweeper is great but it has two problems.1. The handle latch breaks fairly early in the game and a handyman can fix this.2. The main drive gear when it is gone there is no replacement available.That is why we ordered two machines at this time.
1,Battery lasted 5 minutes,The product itself is a great one because I was replacing it for one that I have had 3 years. The battery was charged for 8 hours just as recommended but it will not hold a charge so I must return it.
1,bearspet,"I agree with the majority of the reviews - the battery life is horrible. It worked great when the battery was charged, but after a bit the battery would no longer charge no matter how long I kept it plugged in. I finally trashed the whole thing."
1,Same thing - worked initially and now doesn't,"I don't know if it is the sweeper or the battery, probably the battery, but after a short period of use it does not work at all. The brushes were cleaned. There is no logical reason for it to not work. I am very disappointed in this product."
2,cheaply made,"I was so excited when I first used this product. However, shortly after I started using it, I noticed that the batter pack would not stay in place and the sweeper would stop running quite often during use. The battery/power base has since stopped charging. (I have had this product for 5 months.) I do not recommend this product to anyone who wants it to last more than a few months."
1,Do not buy this!,This sweeper didn't work from the get go and forget about getting a replacement without paying for it big time. It will be cheaper for us to buy a new one then to get a replacement from them. The customer service is horrible. Why should I have to pay for replacement parts when the product didn't work in the first place. This is ridiculous. Save your money and buy a better one.
1,scunci swivel sweeper,Purchased a defective item. Battery did not charge. Contacted company and I returned item per their direction. I returned item in March since then their marketing company has gone under and scunci hair has purchased. They will not honor my return.I am now out a vacuum cleaner.
1,DO NOT BUY !!,"This product has a very poor battery. The lowest price battery replacement that I could found online is about $22 including shipping, or about 63% of the cost a new one on Amazon. I believe the manufacture had designed the product to make money mainly on sale of battery replacement since the battery failed to function more than 5 minutes after only 4 charges over about a 6-week period.It had never sweep for 45 minutes on a single charge as it advertized. It's more like 30 minutes. It production works OK when the battery provided the charge. I had decided not to invest another $22 for every 6 weeks of use."
1,Piece of junk,"I had to sweep at least 3 or 4 times to pick up everything on the floor. After charging about 10 times, the battery no longer charged. Lousy quality. I threw it in the trash can last week. My vacuum cleaner does a much better job on both carpet and hardwood floor. It's very light, but most vacuum cleaners have wheels, it's really not that bad. Don't trust what you see in the TV commercials."
1,A Waste of $30!,"I can't believe I wasted $30 of my hard-earned money on this thing! Not only does it not pick up much of anything, but the batteries only lasted a few days. And now I find out that I can't replace them with regular batteries. I have to buy a battery pack for $20 more! I'm throwing this trash in the trash!"
4,my third one,"I am on my third Swivel Sweeper over the last 9 years. I tried to go without one for a while, but missed the ease of it. Totally hated using a broom and dustpan."
4,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,I really enjoy this product. It is light weight; goes from tile to carpet without having to change from one position to another; it holds it's charge well; it goes around chair legs and under tables easily; it picks up most anything I've ever had on the floor.It was easy to assemble also.
4,"Wow, it really works!!","I am always skeptical when I see claims about gadgets on TV. I saw this thing demonstrated on The View and decided to try it. It is very well made and has some very convenient features. The rechargeable battery provides good power and lasts a good 30 minutes before requiring a charge. The sweeper picks up just about anything but sometimes spits items back out. The segmented handle stays together well and is strong enough for the job. I would have liked to have seen a feature on the battery charger that lets you know when the battery is fully charged. All-in-all, a great gadget at a fair price that really works!"
3,Great sweeper - terrible battery,The swivel sweeper does what they say and more BUT the battery does not last. Mine worked great to start with but the battery progressively had less and less charge and now is down to a minute or so. I wish I could get a good battery for it as it really works very well (when the battery charges).
3,"Great at first, but worthless after 6 months",When I first received this as a Christmas present it had a broken slider tab so I exchanged it for a new one. I used the new one daily for 6 months and loved it. The best thing is that the kids love it so they vacuum for me! But now the battery is weak which makes it not worth using. If they could get a high-powered battery this vacuum would be one of my favorite cleaning tools.
4,No Major Complaints,I have no major complaints about the swivel sweeper. I use my in place of my broom on the kitchen floor. I have had no problems from the battery. I have had the swivel sweeper for over a year. I also got my sister one and she still uses hers. I just do not like having the clean the sweepers. That takes a lot of time and makes a mess. Other than that I have no complaints about the product. I would buy again.
5,Love Mine,"I've seen a lot of bad reviews about this product not lasting. It may be a fluke, but mine is 3 years old and still going strong. I use it all the time (ceramic kitchen floor only- never used on carpet) and never have had a problem. And, here is the crazy thing, I leave the battery in the charging base for DAYS at a time (which you are NOT supposed to do). My mother is a teacher and owns two Swivel Sweepers so she can have one at school and home. She too LOVES hers and they've lasted a couple of years so far.The product is a bit loud, but that has never bothered me."
4,great,This is the lightest and handiest sweeper i have had.it picks up better than the electric broom i had.At first it did not hold charge for more than 10 minutes but after charging again it is much better.love it
1,Battery Killer,"I've had my swivel sweeper for about 8 months. At this point, a fully charged battery lasts about 30 seconds -- no kidding -- before it runs out of juice. I won't buy another swivel sweeper."
1,Don't bother,"Bought this as a Christmas present to replace an older model whose battery was shot. Also bought a replacement battery for the older unit. The new unit doesn't have the same speed/power of the older one with the new battery. And the battery is about dead after 5 minutes of use. And a fully charged battery is so weak after a week of sitting in the closet the unit won't even run. However, the older model with the new battery works better than ever. I wasted money buying a new sweeper. And the new sweeper won't accept the new battery I bought for the older sweeper."
3,Blink and the battery is dead!,"And you wonder why I even bother giving it a 3 star rating. It actually works great and guess what? This original does a much better job than the newer red version, G2 is it? I have bought 4 of these including the red one and while this one does a better cleaning job and has a better battery life than the red, they both die way too young! None of the 4 have lasted more than a year. That's enough money down the drain. Their lifespan is anywhere from 1 month to 9 months and this is with light use! Right now I am using a rubber broom on my wood floors. I am hoping to find a quality electric sweeper that works great, is affordable and lasts more than a year."
4,Cool tool!,"The Swivel Sweeper is a great product, but you have to take care of it. This is my second purchase in less than a year. It was my mistake that caused the first one to go bad, though. I overcharged the battery, because I just forgot to unplug the charger, or take the battery out. I was going to buy just a new battery, but they are almost as much as a whole new unit, so I opted for the whole unit. It's OK though, because now I have the old one for spare parts. It works great. It goes under beds, and the coffee table, and around corners...really does everything it says on TV."
4,very handy,"I had the Eureka cordless vac, but every time I went to use it the battery was dead, also I could not keep it in the kitchen where I needed it. This little sweeper does what I need and stays charged for a long time. Keep in mind that it does not have suction, it is just a rotary brush sweeper, but it does a great job. And I love how easy it swivels."
2,Works good at first,"After a few months of using the sweeper, it no longer works for more than 30 seconds because the battery no longer charges properly. I used this on mainly hardwood and on some rug. After a while it's very troublesome to clean because hair easily gets tangled in the vac which in turn breaks the vac down. It is also very flimsy and plastic and so if you push it hard it overturns and all that you vacuumed -dirt, crumbs, etc. flies out, and you're left with an even greater mess to clean up. Rip-off.

1,VERY Disappointed,"I received this product as a Christmas gift. It worked great after the initial battery charge and I really loved it. But, after the 2nd charge it started stopping after less than 1 minute of use. Took it apart, cleaned all the bristles, recharged the battery, it still would not work for longer than about 30 seconds. I sent it back. Waited 3 weeks for a new one. After the first charge it worked great. But now after the 2nd charge this one won't work either! Please do not waste your money, this product is defective."
2,It is only good for light housekeeping. Not major messes like I make at times.,This product is for light housekeeping. It is not for the major messes that I make regularly. It is truely a light and flexible piece of equipmnet. It is not designed to clean the entire house in on shot. It is ideal for touch up cleaning.
2,Enjoy it while it lasts!,"I have purchased this item 3 times now. Shame on me! When it works it does the job quite well. The problem is it doesn't work for very long. Either it breaks or the battery dies. Either way, you spend more money on something that has a life expectancy of something less than 6 months with any type of steady use. I would actually pay a little more for it if it was built to last. Look elsewhere or plan to replace 2X a year or more."
1,"Original, Old Model Swivel Sweeper","Sorry I bought 2 of these but I went with the original, old model because the shaft is stronger than the newer G2 model. Ours snapped right in half.What I forgot about was with the original, old model it is a pain to dump the waste because you have to take the bottom tray off and dump it into the garbage can, hoping you don't spill it all over the place.This doesn't happen with the newer G2 model. With it, one presses a button, the bottom opens and the waste dumps out.And another thing the original, old model does is that it can easily flip itself over when vacuuming dumping the contents all over the floor that you just vacuumed up! This flipping does not happen with the newer G2 model either.Swivel Sweepers are handy for quick vacuuming, nothing heavy duty."
4,"Not a vacuum cleaner, but..","I only use my Swivel Sweeper to clean around the cat litter box and for small clean ups. It's not like a heavy vacuum, but I didn't expect it to be. As for the battery, I've had one for four or five months and have only had to recharge the battery once. I just gave one to my daughter for her dorm room. She couldn't use a vacuum because she's physically handicapped-they're just too heavy. She loves it. As for the price and shipping, I bought mine at Bed Bath & Beyond for about $30, with no shipping."
4,Very practical but low quality,The sweeper is very practical and does the work as they promises on TV.But (and this is big significant but) the charger and battery are made with low quality electric materials.My charger was burned after one use and seems that the butteries will not keep much longer.It is very sad and pity because the idea is brilliant.So my suggestion is wait for a better model.
4,"SWIVEL 'SWEEPER"" IS JUST THAT","After seeing the swivel sweeper infomercial on TV I thought I would give it a whirl. I have a fairly large home with many pets and a wonderful central vacuum to clean it with on a 2 to 3 times a week basis. What I needed was something small to use for quick clean ups in between serious vacuuming. I charged the sweeper the full 8 hours and gave it a whirl. What I noticed at first was that the sweeper seems to operate with no suction whatsoever. Yet it ""swept"" all surface dirt up with ease. It is in no way, however, to be considered a vacuum cleaner. It will NOT deep clean your carpets. It does do a wonderful job of cleaning even fairly large items off the surface of the carpets and floors though. If you are looking for a sweeper for light but thorough ""quick"" cleaning the swivel sweeper delivers."
5,mark elf,a must for jazz guitar players who understand the heritage of true improv bebop. coltrane wes and bird would buy this.
5,"Strong characters, great story",What can I say... Read this book. It is full of surprises and the characters are well written - you can feel the passion from each one as the words leap of the page.
2,Really annoying hum.,"We got this TV for the size (or lack thereof), but the low hum it emits was very irritating. It is particularly noticeable with the volume down and in a small room, which was how it was mainly used. I had to return it."
5,Finejewelers,"I was very pleased with the communication with the people at Finejewlers. I ordered the earrings just before Christmas, but not as a gift. They asked if it would be alright to send them when the Jewelers returned after January 1st. I had no problem with this. The earrings arrived, as promised, packaged in a gift box, and are much nicer than they looked in the picture. It wa a pleasure doing business with them."
2,Fragile,"Light output is very good, nice beam pattern. However the plastic lens is fragile. I have had them installed for a year and have twice been taken out by highway pebbles. I am about to yank them out and look for something mOre solid."
3,Baby care set.,"The set pictured isn't the set I recieved. A bit skeptical after reading others' reviews saying the same. I bought it anyway. I recieved it in a timely manner. It comes in a cute travel case. Some of the items are a bit cheap looking, but my daughter loves the sterier bottles that come with it."
4,Good product,I ordered this product because I just had a new Mohawk laminate floor installed in my kitchen and I didn't really know how to take care of it. I used a dry microfiber mop and a light misting of the floor cleaner and it did a fantastic job and took just minutes. The floor was dry enough to walk on almost immediately. I'll probably stay with this product.
5,This is one of our favorite books,"The close relationship of the sisters is carefully written, and it always tears me up at the end when Kyla copies her baby sister instead of the other way around. And I love the natural, unforced language - your child will emulate *your* speech, not the speech of book characters."
4,Seems to Work Well,"BioFreeze was recommended by the nurse at work when I strained my shoulder, so I ordered these for home use. I'm not sure they have a lasting benefit, but they do make it feel better, and it drys non-greasy. The packet was slightly more than I required at once, so sometimes I only squeezed out half, leaving the other half for the next time. I figured that's better than over-application."
1,I love ColPac but the ones i received were bad,"I love the blue Colpacs and i thought i would try the black Colpac but when we received them they were old. When these sit on the shelf too long they get old and hard and crack. While ours was in the original box, they were old and are not usable. Sad."
3,Great Television for Movies & DVD's,"This television also replaced a Zenith 27"" color television that was put to rest after a houseguest watered my hanging plant over the back of the television-you can guess what happened. Anyway this Philips television plays dvd movies and cable tv movies with a great picture and sound. But it seems the reds are more like pinks, and the color does not stay the same from channel to channel. But I can live with it."
3,Obviously I must read it again...,"...because I just didn't get where the fuzz's about.It's an okay book and very well written, but the title alone just promises you more then you get.If you are a read-everything-there-is-about-gambling kind of person, then it's a ""must buy"".But if you are not...well, then buy it if you like autobio's, this one being about 6 separate guys from between the 30's and 70's living of different kinds of gambling and there stories."
5,For anyone struggling with the shocks or loss,"In Rainbow Remedies For Life's Stormy Times, author Joanne Hill shares self-help remedies for surviving and thriving after emotional shocks and hard times. She gained this invaluable insights when twelve members of her family died within a four year span. Readers will find her seven remedies to survive crisis and go on to live a ""rainbow"" life; a potent formula to heal loss and painful relationships; seven ways to help others without exhausting yourself; a powerful treatment to ease fear and anxiety; and eighteen questions to empower the choices you make. Articulate, inspiring, practical, and totally accessible, Rainbow Remedies For Life's Stormy Times is strongly recommended reading for anyone struggling with the shocks, loss, and disappointments that any of us are at risk for."
4,inside donnellascloset -deal breakers found out!,"SR SQUARED by Sondra Roberts Black Point Trapunto ToteThis is one of the better ""self-help"" books I've read.Its an easy read, yes, but I think its direct wording makes it easier for you to self reflect and think on the points that may be relevant to you.My mother took my copy and I read part of it to my friend while she was down in Utah! I say read it on the bus or train and think about how easy it is to pin-point the negative elements but also admit what makes you happy or not, when looking for a partner."
2,Just not what I was looking for,"This book just didn't seem to say anything significantly important. There was never a moment when I thought ""Wow, this is what I'm going through, I can totally relate."" Therefore, I didn't learn anything. Not a horrible book, just not for me. I am now reading ""Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay"" by Mira Kirchenbaum. It is excellent, I cannot put it down. It's more a step by step guide that I needed, with questions you answer pertaining to your own relationship, and what your answers reveal is just so eye-opening, it's amazing."
2,"In retrospect, a hype job","The book was published about seven years ago. If the work that Levy described was so cutting edge, so on the verge of the breakthrough to sentient life (as one reviewer below put it), then why has virtually nothing new come out of this Alife field in the last seven years?"
4,Zyu Review,"I was a fan of the original Power Rangers in the USA and made the leap to a fan of Zyuranger. I enjoy the CD. The booklet shows six previously released CDs, but since I don't own those I can't tell you how they compare. Complete Song Collection sounds very clear. I can't speak or read Japanese so I can't really say anything about the insert. If you watched the show you'll be familiar with most if not all the songs. I was very pleased to see Dolla![Track 2](Bandora's song)on the list. Tracks 1-10 are vocal performances with Tracks 11-19 being music and background singing of Tracks 1-8 & 10 probably for karaoke."
4,The Thomas McGuane segment,"Thomas McGuane comes to speak with Charlie Rose about a new novel, 'The Cadence of Grass'. The interview takes place a few months after 9/11 and McGuane speaks about how isolated folks of Montana were moved by it to greater connection with the U.S. as a whole. McGuane and Rose exchange cliches on the U.S. as special country but not superior one. McGuane speaks of his childhood interest in the Western. I do not know the work of McGuane and did not truly get a strong feeling of what it is from this conversation. But as Rose mentions he is a much - praised novelist with a considerable track - record. I suspect this conversation will be of real interest primarily to his readers."
4,A labor of love...,"Within this well done, low budget biopic, we are treated to director Nico B's wonderful, highly detailed recreations of several of the famous Irving Klaw bondage vignettes featuring Bettie Page. So, essentially, this movie offers a series of films within a film. While the acting might be considered a bit stiff in places, the video looks great and the costuming, sets and music are dead-on. Ultra-cute fetish model Paige Richards does a respectable job as Bettie Page. Normally, I would relegate a disc like this to die-hard Bettie fans only, but in today's ""retro-craze"" atmosphere, others may find it appealing as well. This movie has an innocent charm all its own, very much like the woman to which it is dedicated."
3,AN OK VERSION,"IT'S A GOOD MOVIE, BUT COULD BE MUCH BETTER. IT IS A MOVIE ABOUT NUDE PHOTOGRAPHY, BUT WITHOUT ANY NUDE PHOTOGRAPHY, SORT OF LIKE A CAR MOVIE WITHOUT ANY CARS. LEAVES YOU UNSATISFIED."
3,Vintage Brookner,"A book by Anita Brookner is always depressing. I can't read more than one at a time. But why read them at all? A friend asked me this question and after pondering it I thought: Because when you open a Brookner, you know what world you're in. It's a discreet world of well-educated, upper middle class people (mainly women) living in comfortable circumstances. Yes, they're also desperate and blighted people. Someone is usually dying but meanwhile sitting up in bed in a very perky peignoir. Once that elderly mother dies, though, things get much worse for the unmarried daughter or son left behind. ""Fraud"" follows all of Brookner's usual conventions yet it resolves itself strangely quickly, without a firm foundation, after an intriguing beginning suggesting a mystery. If you like Brookner, you'll like ""Fraud."""
2,Large hands only!,"Well constructed and works well. However, anyone with small to medium-sized hands will not find this stapler easy to use. A small-handed person may not be able to use it at all. Curiously, in the one-page ""manual,"" the high-low feature gets a one-sentence uninformative description in English, but a lengthy, detailed explanation in Spanish and French. Try before purchasing if possible."
3,A preachy if offbeat autobiography,"John Harland tells of he and his girlfriendsetting out to try different alternative lifestylesuntil they found the one that suited them.While the philisophical discussion here can beinteresting, overall the book tends toward thepreachy side."
1,Really boring,"This book was so slow and introspective I scanned the last 200 pages. There were two interesting characters: Gena and Ollie--and they were secondary characters. Nothing happens--girl gets pregnant, parents break couple up, they find each other at the end after a great deal of soul searching and worry and crying. I have my doubts that an ex-con with five ex-wives was the best choice for a husband and means a happy ending.I grew up in Kansas City about the same time the author did. I enjoyed the names of familiar roads but some of the geography was off, which threw me. However, this is fiction, so I accept that."
4,This Music Box is sweet music to mystery lovers,"A wise cracking medical doctor who's enchanted, enamored and nearly obsessed with music boxes find himself involved in the middle of a murder mystery he can't possibly resist. What a delightful way for author Karp to introduce us to a cast of colorful characters and introduce readers to an appreciation of antique music boxes.There's three Thomas Purdue mysteries out now with more on the way and Karp starts his series out in fine form. This one reads fast, is packed with wit, dry humor, delightful twists, some risque' developments and delivers a delightfully choreographed Agatha Christie kind of ending.There's a self confidence to Larry Karp's prose and his dialogue crackles with a brightness that's refreshing, funny and clear.If you like who-done-it mysteries you'll want to get a copy of this delightful book right away.Christopher J. Jarmick is the co-Author of the mystery-thriller, The Glass Cocoon (with Serena F. Holder)."
2,Not for P2P applications,"If you use P2P (file sharing) applications, then this modem is not for you. It has a maximum of 192 simlutaneous connections, and it can't be increased using telnet. Even when I set my P2P application to a max of 80 connections, I couldn't visit any webpages because they wouldn't load up. Furthermore, when compared to my previous modem (Westell 327W), it was about 100kb/s slower on the upload, but the download speed was the same.However, if you don't use P2P applications, and all you do is surf the web, then I would consider this to be an excellent modem."
1,This Modem has the worst UI I've seen in years!,"This modenm is a piece of junk.I spent several hours trying to comprehend it's obscenely obscure user interface (UI) and then, when i finally got it working, it lost all the settings. Four times!(I am a 30+ year pro, so this isn't a newbie mistake.)Absolutely the worst product interface and usability i've seen in years.Don't buy this modem!"
3,History of Music,"This CD contains a lot of good information and music. The only difficulty I found was getting it to play on various computers. There was a compatability issue, I think."
3,Cat Mysteries,Very slow moving story. The author provided a lot more character development and detail of life in the small town than I care for.
2,Confusing,"I was very exited to try Teach Me Guitar. However I was quickly dissapointed. First off, it crashed my computer. After several calls into the company,I got it working but the lessons were confusing because they skipped around a lot. I learned very little for the program over all."
5,A MUST FOR MAC CD BURNERS,"This is by far the best cd burning program I have used. It takes care of everything Mp3, Disc copy, and is very easy to use. You can even hook up turntables & tape deck and convert that to CD format. And the cable to do it with is included. If you have a burner and dont have Toast 4 Deluxe, BUY IT!"
1,Not for everyone,"Don't read this book if you don't practice ""Attachment Parenting"". It has no help for you if you don't subscribe to the Sears way. I also prefer ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" by Dr. Harvey Karp. The methods in Dr. Karp's book worked WONDERS!"
1,Science or religion?,"""Attachment parenting"" is a religion with many followers, and Dr Sears is making a lot of money publishing the same information under different titles: ""The attachment parenting book"", ""The fussy baby book"", ""The fussy book how to bring the best in your high need child""... Save yourself a lot of money, go to your public library, browse through one of his books and decide for yourself. Don't even bother if you are not breastfeeding or are going back to work after having the baby (This book will make you feel guilty!).Instead read ""Your fussy baby"" by Dr Weissbluth. He provides a scientific explanation for fussiness and gives advises and suggestions on how to deal with it. Furthermore, you'll realize that fussiness is just a phase babies go through (so, you don't have to keep buying books that promise the perfect and only solution)"
5,Jordan Feedback,"I appreciated everything you did for me, especially how you handle getting me another game. I had no problem with you all because when I got in contact with you all I heard from you all every time and you all made sure I got my game. Once again thank you all and I will be doing business with you all again."
3,UMM....um....okay,"It's hard to make a football handheld. We found that out from Nintendo. But NCAA 07 Graphics wise is good. From the Madden 06 title, I knew Football games for handhelds finally had potential. But this game didnt really take the cake if you understand where I coming from. This game feels kinda dead. The game modes are deep, but they can get so damn boring. And I am always constantly being raped on 3rd/4th and short situations. This game at least tells you how much refs SUCK!!! Good First try for NCAA on the PSP though. It just needs a little work."
3,Something Lacking,This is an interesting read. It is a fairly decent survey of the involvement of the Hitler Jugend in the fighting in the closing months of combat during World War II in Europe. Where it is lacking is in setting up the background of the HJ. It doesn't explain what the HJ was or its basic organization. Nor does it say anything about the Waffen SS Hitler Jugend division that had its baptism of fire in Normandy. This division was organized by Artur Axmann and presented to Hitler as a birthday gift in April 1944. It was composed of primarily eighteen year olds who were recruited from the HJ.
3,"THREE Stars, but only based on sound quality","I can't disagree with any of the comments left by my peers about this recording, except to add that the sound quality can detract from the listening enjoyment somewhat. While not nearly as bad as some, and not as good in some respects as Wham!, it's nonetheless not a FIVE STAR recording in the strictest sense (neither is Wham!, though). From an archival standpoint, however, the recordings offered in this release should be in your library, if for no other reason than to hear a joyous, loose and swinging version of Norwegian Wood, or for the steroidal version of So What (I wonder if Miles ever heard this). Issued in much the same format as a typical nights set, in some respects I prefer this over Wham! Channel One Suite has the distinction, for me, of being one of the most interesting, albeit one of the longest, versions available. Buddy's snare work is clear and distinct throughout."
2,Niceties and generalities,A good book for managers and other would be nomenklaturist that need to know the general view from the sky about what is and what can you do with SGML.Almost useless for the techie interested in the internal workings/practicalities of SGML
1,BEWARE!,"AV channels appear with verticle grey bars on many of these sets. This means when you watch DVDs you will see grey bars appear over the picture. This is an ongoing problem it seems with Philips larger sets. I was told by the Philips repair person that this has something to do with the power source not being shielded well enough on quite a few of there sets, though not enough to demand a recall(?!) Have been dealing with Philips for weeks now trying to get this sorted out, with much difficulty. Otherwise picture and sound has been fine on other channels. If you have or may have in the future any interest in watching DVDs on your tv, go with another brand."
4,Excellent value,"The price for this tv is a real bargin, but the quality is excellent. It has all the features that most people would want. The sound and picture are very good, and the remote is easy to operate. I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Hard to explain to some kids,"My daughter had a hard time understanding why Amelia could not do things correctly. I think she is too young for these books, she is 4."
2,Unrealistic,This book is pretty dumb. The quality of writing is low and the jokes aren't funny. It also is a very unrealistic description of Mormon teenage life. The two stars are for the enjoyment me and my family had making fun of it and for the fact that we did not get bored enough to stop listening.
2,lyme disease book sexist,"I have had Lyme for over thirty years and I am considered uncurable,so I looked forward to reading this book. It was amazing she had a chapter on young people, teens, women, elderly and animals. Where was a chapter on men? Or are we considered to be part of the animal section? Other than this glaring sexist blind spot the book did have some good points, especially to people who have just contracted the Lyme Disease.Sincerely,Chesley Farrell"
4,good show,good characters in general although some are a bit over the top ... a bit fuzzy on how long I'd watch it
1,Why spend time with such people?,"I gave up half-way into the second episode. Watching just made me feel dirty. The main character is despicable. Nor do I care for any character. They are either pasties, or loathsome.Why would I want these people in my living room?SPOILER ALERT:I cringe when writers kill an animal to make a plot device.I also hated that there were no English sub-titles, the many murky scenes, and just the whole way the series was photographed/edited.The writing was also DUMB. The whole thing hinges on if the Ted Danson character meet with his broker on X day to place a sell order? Had the writers never heard of a new-fangled invention called a disposable cell phone? The character might have called in the sell order!"
2,Not great - why all the hype?,"We are watching this on Netflix now, and I know the only reason we have gotten so far into it is because there is no wait between episodes. They are all supposed to be these brilliant minds, yet there is NO brilliance! The incredibly naive main character is supposed to have this fantasic legal mind, but she seems to have trouble figuring out whats for lunch; no way she could make it out of law school. The attorneys from Law and Order are more interesting.Most annoying the obvious manipulation is really over the top; its like watching with a bunch of 6th grade girls. Insults followed by flattery, then more insults. Golly is Patty really my friend?Something to watch if you are bored, buti really don't see how this show could confuse or thril anyone."
3,cute but slippery,"Purchased these shoes through a different retailer and found them on clearance. These are adorable, but I wouldn't pay $84 for them. They are a bit slippery on the bottom before getting some scuffing(i have other shoes with much better traction). I am either a 9 1/2 or a 10, depending on the shoe and opted for the 9 1/2 in these. The first few days were a little rough stretching out the peep toe, but once they formed to my foot it was a perfect fit. As i said, they are adorable."
5,Entertaining beyond belief,"Whether you're pot head or an anti-drug conservative (like me), this movie will appeal to you. The music ranges from all-out rock to swing, and the dozen or so songs hit the spot about 95% of the time. The acting is so over-the-top great, with solid performances from everyone.The lyrics are a total hoot. Not since Tom Lehrer has anyone written a song where lyrics rhyme the word transubstantiation.If you are wary of seeing it because of the subject matter - don't worry. The movie is like an extended South Park episode, with both sides of the drug issue represented with equal absurdity. It is 100% entertainment....and, hey, it's got zombies. What's not to love?I could easily sit through this one a couple of more times, but imagine the pot heads out there would love it even after 100 viewings, simply because their drug-ridden minds are incapable of retaining 90 minutes of anything."
2,"the movie rocks, the dvd sucks",it doesnt even have english subtitles....hope they get a new version soon (even the 1936' movie by that name has at least 5 version of the dvd)plus main didnt work so well
3,Just what I thought.,"this DVD was okay. Given the title, i didn't expect much, but there were some surprisingly great vocal performances despite the really lame plot. Not a bad film to watch, but probably only once!"
1,Capvie vedio capture device,I tried to install this device in win98. It just disabled other USB devices and yet it did not work. It waisted lots of my time and efforts but no result.Next I tried to install it with my P4 laptop with winxp.This time the problem was greater and the result was NO HOPeI think this device is not worh to buy at all.
5,Boppin' Til I Drop!,"I first heard ""Bop 'til You Drop"" on an NPR show in the eighties, and I just had to run out and get the album. It was an album on vinyl! I was thinking about them the other day, no longer have a record player, and decided to look around Amazon. They had this one and Seamless, two wonderful albums.The song ""Bop 'til You Drop"" is here, and is definitely a fun time, dancin' classic. They also do justice a couple of 50's and 60's classics, ""Silhouettes"" and ""Town Without Pity"". Maybe it's the Irish in me, I do sometimes go for the sentimental and romantic stuff. ""Up the Ladder to the Roof (so we can see heaven much better)"" and ""Please (Don't Go)"" are truly things of beauty! If you want to get the definitive of this group, grab this one and Seamless. The only drawback is that back in the 80's, they were still doing only 45 minute albums."
4,Not bad,"These measuring spoons are pretty nice. I'm not too thrilled about the fact that their handles are slightly curved. It would also be nice to have a 1/8 tspn included. Minor complaints aside, they look nice and they do what they are supposed to do."
1,bad spoones,"i wantd spoones becase my pet ferret needes to be spoone fed, but then my ferret eat the spoone and had to go to the haspital. i dont recomend because if eaten thees spoones are dangerus"
2,handle bar,"The bar is nice because its wider but its true its easy to bend, so its not for any extreme thing. Best for cruising bikes etc."
2,Terrible Quality,"OK if you are an extremely leisurely rider. aka avoid all bumps, etc. They WILL bend on you fast if you ride any sort of rough terrain."
1,Bodyblade,"As a personal trainer, I bought this product after a client used one in physical therapy, and she thought it was a great core workout. I exchanged the first one I purchased called the ""Light"", which was very small and very light resistance, for the ""Classic"", after speaking to the seller on the phone. I watched the video which features two models, a female Barbie look-alike and a male Ken look-alike, demonstrating the different exercices you can do. I just wasn't that impressed with the exercise's effectiveness and thought it would take too much getting used to for clients. After trying it out with a couple of clients, I decided to return the product, feeling that for the expensive price tag,it just wasn't suitable for my clientele."
4,"Liked it, BUT","Like it , but two (2) things it could have. one is an adjustable tube (the part the hose connects to) and the cord should recoil. It would be worth it to pay a little more for these additions!!!"
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought the Eureka 3670G Boss Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum Cleaner for my son (he is in college and lives in a house with other students). The vacuum cleaner does it basic job well, which is all I expected given the price. The biggest negative for me is the very loud noise it makes. It doesn't come with any bells and whistles - but again, I cannot really complain given the price. I wish there were more canister vacuums that don't have expensive electronic brush attachments meant for carpeting. Now the choice seems to be between a very expensive (and excellent) Miele model and the basic stripped down version like this one."
4,Great Product and Lightweight,"I was looking for a powerful, lightweight vacuum cleaner. I saw the great reviews on Amazon and bought it. I was very impressed with this little machine. It's so light but still very powerful, I even vacuumed the car!!One drawback is the noise, it's not deafening, but loud. Still for this price a GREAT BUY!"
3,"good, but....","The vacuum itself is great...good suction, nice size, etc. But...the floor attachment seems to have a mind of its own, perhaps because of the small fixed wheels at each side. To guide it, you need to use a lot of wrist action and that gets tiring. I've taken to using the floor attachment left over from my old vacuum. Change this feature and you'd have a truly mighty vacuum."
3,"Mighty-Mite, the next generation","I bought this vacuum to replace its predecessor, a 20 year old Mighty Mite, which is falling to pieces but still works. The floor head on this new one is much easier to use- swivels very conveniently. It is higher-power, (better suction, but it blew a circuit the first time I used it), and the noise it makes is MUCH louder than the old one. The brush and fabric attachments have been combined into one very small one, whose shape does not allow it to get into crevasses in furniture. I'm using the attachments from the old one instead."
3,Almost good,"I do not know what is wrong with the makers of this vacuum. It has modest suction, but it is very light. But the attachments are terrible. The ""bypass"" opening which you use to vacuum drapes etc. when you want reduced suction, is placed right where you hand goes, so you constantly open it accidently. The brush attachment is terribly designed; the brush is too short and it is made so that it cannot reach the edge or corner of anything like a shelf. The floor attachment has only a few brushes on it, in such a way that you vacuum over things without disturbing them enough for the modest suction."
3,Good on Hard floors,Very loud and should not be used on carpeting. No longer use since I am now at an Independent Living Faciluity where they do the housecleaning weekly. Keep on hand in case of spills inbetween cleanings.
5,GREAT VALUE,good service quality and price just what I was looking for. I always shop for good value and name brands
3,Inexpensive vacuum,"I bought this vacuum because of the price and ratings. The good news is it does work efficiently. However, it is best for wood and ceramic floors. For a tiny vacuum; the cord is long, the bag is big enough for multiple vacuum events. However, for carpet, you need to apply extra effort to really get the carpet clean. Not disappointed, but not amazed either."
2,Hot,"The canister gets burning hot during even the briefest of use. Even the handle is too hot to hold. I worry my daughter will get burned. I spoke to Eureka, they were unconcerned. I would not reccomend this product."
2,one of the worst vacuum cleaners I've ever had,This vacuum cleaner gets clogged constantly. I have a dog and vacuuming up the dog hair clogs it most of the time. When I use the blower it takes a long time to get the hair out. I wouldn't recommend this vacuum cleaner at all. I wish I had bought something else!
2,Useless attachments,"Just received this vacuum and wonder why they designed the small corner/duster the way they did. Because it is so bulky, it won't fit into corners - which makes it useless to me. And because it's black it leaves marks on walls. I will be using an old attachment from my white handheld oreck instead. Suction is ok, but we purchased it primarily for corners, spiderwebs, crevice cleanup, so small attachments are a big dissappointment.PW"
1,Loud and useless,After reading all the reviews I selected this canister vacuum. After just 3 uses it is useless. It very loud when it runs but does not have any suction. We are very disappointed and feel we waisted our money and our time. We would not recommend it to anyone.
3,"compact, but not very powerful","I would like to write this review for the benefit of other consumers like myself. When I started looking for a new vacuum, I knew I wanted something as small as possible. I had had an upright for a while that I was pretty happy with, but it started falling apart. I like the size of the mighty mite, but not the power. It's a bit weak. It simply does not have anywhere near the suction power of my previous vacuum. I am not too satisfied at all."
4,great for the price vacuum,"I bought this vacuum because I wanted something I could use on my hardwood floors, stairs, and clean furniture. This is easy to carry and pull around. I worked for a house cleaning company and this is the same type of vacuum we use only difference is the handle if you want that one order the commercial Eureka has a metal handle that telescopes up and down with a push of a button. The only problem I have with this one is if I use it on carpet it is a little harder to push because of the sucking power. It is a great vacuum cleaner for the price and just right for what I need it for."
5,Surprised and delighted,"Best back up or main vacuum ever. Great suction,made well and gets the job done. I highly recommend this product. Purchased this for garage/storage area maintenance but have used it all over. Great for car also. I have always liked Eureka and this does not disappoint."
3,Special needs vacuum,"We have several high-end vacuum cleaners and brooms. We needed something light to vacuum high up and in the cars. Wall sconces, foot wells, etc. The housekeeper uses this Eureka for the hard-surface floors in our home and she thought it was OK for her uses so we bought one too. It seems a little light weight but then it didn't cost $400 and the bags are readily available on line."
