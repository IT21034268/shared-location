4,Excellent Restaurant + Cookbook,"We love to eat at Cafe Flora, and the cookbook allows us to try out some of our favorite recipes at home. We recently bought a copy for a relative, and she enjoyed it for the diverse approach to vegetarian cuisine."
2,To complex,"Absalom Absalom it a very complex book..It's very difficult to understand because Faulkner switches narrators so many times in the book. I had to flip back numerous times so i could remember who said what..If your up to a challenge then this is the pefect book for you however it wasn't for me..If you do choose to read this book, keep a dictionary handy.."
1,Like medicine,"Faulkner has to be the most overrated writer in literary history. This book is aimless, uninteresting and tedious to levels unheard of. But ""literary"" people see it as their duty to enjoy this novel at all costs, for Faulkner has been championed as our answer to Joyce, Woolf, Proust, who all, alas! soar above him. Nobody enjoys reading Faulkner but it is ""good for you"" somehow, and thus this book will be painfully read for a long time to come."
1,Not good!,"I wished I had read the previous reviews before I jumped to buy this book. Unless you really know about gift baskets before you read this book, it's not very helpful or clear."
1,Not what I expected.,"When I bought this book, I thought that I would be getting info on how to assemble gift baskets. I was very disappointed. This book merely offers suggestions on what to put in the basket. It offered no thoughts on basket arranging, types of baskets to use. If you are a novice at gift baskets, this is not the book to buy because it does not tell you anything you don't already know. On a positive note, the recipes in the book sound delicious."
4,yes...KISS fans are this fanatical,"KISS fans will all agree that they would go through just about anything to see their masked heroes. For someone like me, the challenge was wishing KISS would get back in make-up and go back on the road. So, I know the elation I felt when I finally saw KISS in person-in full make-up.Even if you are not a KISS fan, I think you would agree that this movies has it's share of laughs. The 70's were sure an interesting time."
4,Entertaining,"I really enoyed this film. I am a Kiss fan and was part of the extras for it. That aside though, it reminded me of Rock And Roll High School meets Dazed and Confused. It really brought me back to that era. It's just a very fun movie."
3,Worth A Look As It Is Pretty Funny - 3.5 Stars,"I really thought I would hate this flick. From a non-kiss fan's perspective though, I have to say I did laugh throughout. I was exactly the age of these guys in 1978 and hated KISS then and hate 'em more now. Really the film has little to do with KISS. It could have been any band. Fortunately the movie focuses on four guys' journey to the show and not the show itself (only the last five minutes of the movie). Sure it is crass, lude, and obscene but so was 1978! Even if you hate KISS like me it is still worth a watch."
4,if and only if you're in the mood for stupid,It's a really funny movie if your in the mood for slapstick and stupidity. An appreciation of KISS is also helpful. There is a lot of gross out and sexual humor so definately inappropriate for younger viewers
1,EXTREMELY SILLY,"Of course it will be getting great reviews because most of the people who are giving five-star rating are KISS fan who will buy anything they release. THe movie has a good concept, but its conduction is cold, impersonal and uninspired from beginning to end. Furlong is awful, also."
4,I want to rock and roll all night and party every day...yeah,"KISS rocks, thats what the 4 band loving boys go to the concert with some disapprovales from some KISS hating parents. along the way they trash a disco loving fan group, they pick up a prostitute. when they arrive at the concert one of their mothers is there, they get beaten up and their tickets stolen but eventually they cleaverly get them back and they see KISS rock the hizouse. of course the main title based on KISS' song ""Detroit Rock City"" we get Gene Simmons sprouting his tounge out from the tounges point of view. Shannon Tweed, Simmons wife appears also. its a rockin and a rollin, fun, fun, fun."
2,not as good as I thought....,This works in theory but the latch to lock it in place is ill-conceived - a person could break a finger trying to get in on and off. maybe the Four paws one is the one I was thinking of...
2,I didn't get any real health benefits from this item,I didn't seem to get the health benefits that are mentioned you receive from green tea extract. I don't think I will buy this item again.
2,Good eraser...but,"I have been using this pencil and these erasers for years and I love them-sudoku means lots of erasing, but the shipping charges are ridiculous! If I didn't live 2 hrs from the nearest office supply store I would never order this item from Amazon!"
1,A romance novel this isn't!,"Parker is an exceptionally good author but this is by far his worst work. At the very least, this novel is his pathetic attempt at emulating the day time soap operas and he fails miserably."
1,misleading title,"I bought this book thinking the parallels would be helpful, and they might have been if I could have seen any parallel between the 2 texts. I just didn't ""get it."" The connection wasn't there for me.I'm a pastor and we were doing a book study on Lao Tzu's writings. As pastor I felt compelled to find similarities between the 2 teachers.I found a few but not with the help of this book.Everyone enjoyed the book discussion anyway."
5,Rings True,"his is the first fiction book I've ever read that has accurately portrayed what it is like to cope with fertility problems. The descriptions of the tests, drugs, procedures and emotions are dead-on. Because it is fiction, the main character has some behavior that is a bit nutsy. For example, the woman who will go to her husband's office and rip his shirt off when he refuses to have sex with her when she is ovulating is probably few and far between. However, once you've taking your temp every morning for a year, peed on sticks for half of every month, and taken drugs that make you crazy, you can certainly see how someone might entertain such behavior. And I very much appreciated reading a book that did not tie everything up in a neat pink or blue bow at the end."
3,Good but not Great. Very Slow Reading,"Randall Price is an excellent prophecy teacher but I did not find this book to be his best. (I read his book - The Coming Last Days Temple and found it to be far better.) It's true he does give you information not covered in the news media and he has a wealth of knowledge. But I found the details difficult to follow. As a result, I found the reading to be slow and it took me longer than usual to finish reading the book. It didn't keep my interest."
3,i just got this,"i went to best buy, and picked this up. well, the thing is its the best fitting headphone i've ever worn. but i use a Motorolla E398 (the motorolla version, before ROKR E1) and the answer button on the headset doesnt work. Its nice that it fits perfect for my mp3 player but i payed 40.00 i think i would like just the answer button to work on the headset.its up to you, this is one of the best head fitting phone that i've worn. so if your buying soley on mp3 player this is a great buy. but becareful if your buying it for your cell phone to answer calls. you just gotta answer the phone call manually on your phone and click the green answer button.yes i'm lazy."
3,A Stark Tale,"Horseman, Pass By is about Lonnie, a teenager who yearns to leave home, the ranch that his 80 year-old grandfather has built from nothing. He lives on that ranch with his forceful but deteriorating grandpa, an African-American servant Halmea (whom he has the hots for), a couple of kindly ranch hands, and Hud, his grandfather's hedonistic and downright mean stepson. The novel recounts the tale of one summer, in which Lonnie's safe world seems to deteriorate around him, tossing him out into that world he so longs to visit.The novel, to me, is one of those hard-to-judge books because I do respect the author and what he accomplished here. This is a grim, anti-western, even anti-coming-of-age story, and McMurtry certainly pulled off his stark, unsentimental, and desperate vision. But that said, I didn't particularly enjoy reading it, as it provided nobody really to root for (except, perhaps, side characters--Lonnie's passivity bothered me too much) and nothing to root for anyway."
3,No Lonesome Dove...,This book starts off good. You get to know all the charachters and feel like you are sitting down for meals with them. Then things start to spin out of control. Too much violence and grief and no clear reason or explanation for any of it. Not one of this author's best books.
2,"Horsemen, Pass By","I did not care for this book at all. Very disapointed. Such a sad story. I have read other novels by this author and have enjoyed his books but not this one. Kind of boring, I kept expecting it to get better but it did not."
1,"Hey, what happened to Diesel Boy the DnB producer?","What's up with this, is there another Diesel Boy? I was expecting to hear some kick ass drum and bass tracks from Diesel Boy, but instead I get this punk rock crap? Or maybe he used to be in a punk band????"
5,Forget the SweetTart candy and give me some SweetTart Traverse Bay Cherries!,"These are the best dried cherries I've found and the best price on top of that! The cherries are moist, sweet, tart and good in everything from oatmeal to salads or just plain for snacking.I love Traverse Bay's dried fruits. Their quality and consistency are much appreciated."
4,They were pretty good.,"They were pretty good but I can't rave about them. I have had better, but they were good. Nothing else really to say, I bought them because they got so many great reviews, but they were just okay (average)."
5,Great Cherries,Great cherries! I eat them plain or in cereal. They're also good for baking. I keep small container of them in the pantry and freeze the rest until I need them.
2,hard cherries,"THIS IS THE 3RD SHIPPMENT OF TRAVERSE BAY DRIED CHERRIES I'VE PURCHASED FROM AMAZON. THIS TIME THE CHERRIES WERE HARDER THEN THOSE IN THE PAST AND THUS HARDER TO CHEW. THIS MAY BE DUE TO LACK OF ADQUATE MOISTURE BEFORE PACKING OR THEY WERE STORED TO LONG AND BECAME DRIED OUT,PRIOR TO SALE. WHAT EVER THE CAUSE THEY WERE NOT AN ENJOYABLE ADDITION TO THE MORNING CEREAL AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST. WILL I BUY AGAIN? I'M NOT SURE AT THIS POINT IN TIME."
4,"Delicious, Preservative-Free and Grown in the USA","These dried cherries are grown in the USA and are delicious to eat plain or to use as a topping on cereal or as part of a trail mix.Another plus--they don't have any preservatives or sulfites added.There are two reasons that I gave these cherries four stars instead of five.1. They have a lot of sugar added, and they are a little on the sweet side for my taste. I prefer to limit my sugar intake and add sugar to food sparingly, but that's not an option with these cherries.2. These cherries, all four pounds of them, are packaged in a single plastic bag which is not resealable. I would have preferred them to ship in several separate bags, or at least a big resealable bag in order to make storing them more convenient.I ended up repackaging the cherries into several heavy-duty Ziploc bags to store them."
3,2nd shipment so different than the first,"Loved the first shipment, big flavorful cherries very sweet and slightly tart. Second shipment cherries were considerably smaller, much drier and not nearly as much flavor."
2,"Used to be great, now awful!","I've ordered about 2 boxes a month of these cherries over the past few years and up until the last shipment (a few weeks ago), they have been excellent. Now, the latest shipments have lacked the quality that they once had. They are now smaller and the taste has changed for the worse. As I eat the dried cherries as a standalone snack, the taste is extremely important! It's very unfortunate that Traverse Bay has changed this and I will no longer be ordering them if this wasn't just a one time difference!"
1,Quality has fallen dramatically,"The quality of the cherries from this company used to be very high, but they appear to be using cherries from another location now. The cherries used to be plump and sweet. Now they are dried out and almost tasteless. Think twice about this purchase if you have purchased cherries from this company in the past. They are not the same cherries that you know and love..."
5,The best cherries come from Michigan!,"I bought a box of these in Michigan last year. When I was close to running out, I started an internet search & found them on Amazon. Cherry Chicken Salad is my absolute favorite lunch. Just top any salad greens with cold, diced grilled chicken breast. Then sprinkle chopped dried cherries and either chopped walnuts or almonds over the greens. Top with Ken's Honey Mustard dressing. Yumm!!! Michigan fruited oatmeal is another favorite. Mix chopped cherries, 1/2 cup applesauce a little brown sugar, chopped nuts of choice with 1C. old-fashioned oats and 2 C. of milk. Bake, uncovered, for 45 min. at 350 degrees. Serve hot or chill. I prefer it cold. Sweet cherries dry too sweet for my taste, but these tart cherries are perfect when dried. They make a great, healthful snack any time. Any fruit from Michigan is excellent in taste and texture."
1,Rancid Tasting,The cherries tasted rancid - DO NO BUY!!!!! We have purchase dried cherries in the past from other companies (Shoreline Foods) and have been extremely happy. Travers Bay Fruit Co. cherries are nasty!!!
3,good for health,"I ordered them after reading an article about the benefits of tart cherries. These cherries are wonderful by themselves, in cookies, or with a nut mixture. It has a very similar taste to prunes with a little more cherry tangy kiss. However, i did get bored of it after going through half of the box."
2,$7.37 price increase in 3 months ?!?,"The last time I bought this item was exactly 3 months ago on April 12, 2012. The price was $28.62, it is now $35.99. That's a sharp increase of $7.37 in 3 months, which is a price increase of nearly $2.00 per lb. - and when you consider that this product is 61% sugar, that's quite a price hike.At this price, Traverse Bay Dried Cherries costs MORE PER LB. than the Trader Joe brand of Montmorency dried Sour Cherries which are delicious and come in smaller bags. The whole point of buying bulk 4 lbs. is that you get a price break over buying smaller bags in grocery stores. Not anymore.I'm gonna go to Trader Joe instead and buy their excellent dried sour cherries which are not as oily , and have a nice tartness.***UPDATE - Aug. 17, 2012 I just bought from Trader Joe their Tart Montmorency Cherries 8 oz. bag for $4.29 yummy!"
3,NOT THAT BAD OF A MOVIE,"The first time I saw this movie was on HBO last week. I checked out the program guide on screen, and it sounded like a decent movie. I recorded it on my dvr. Although it isn't a 4-5 star movie, it doesn't deserve the 1-2 star rating. Sure there isn't the bloodshed, violence, gore, and action that most people are looking for. Just how many movies out there are that believable anyway? Although it lacks all of the elements that I listed, it is a decent movie. It pales to many of the newer releases with action, and special effects. I feel that it is a decent, but not good drama. Whats missing in this movie is the usual foul language, violence, and gore that most people are so used to seeing in a movie. Could this be the main reason this movie is raked over the coals by the reviewers? Do they consider the movie ""boring""? Sure the movie lacks the excitement, suspense, and has a plot that may not appeal to most. It is still a decent movie."
2,TJ's Review,"The Album was FAIR !!!The two songs ""White Rabbit""and Don't you want somebody to love. Was the bomb, took me back. The other songs ok. But I will wear out those two tracks......"
2,"It's not the toy that's bad, I just didn't pay attention","Okay, the palm tree thingy itself isn't bad, I just didn't pay attention to the description/size/measurements. I got excited because it was cute, went ahead and ordered, couldn't believe it was only knee-high when it arrived. Again, that's my fault for not reading the description thoroughly.However, my daughter liked it better in the living room than in the water. She likes to sit in it and watch Sponge Bob (she just turned one on Nov. 19, that's her idea of chilling). She's outgrowing it quickly though, the seat is small."
3,"cute plaything, not that functional","this is more a plaything than something functional as the ""palm tree"" doesn't shade very well..."
5,This was a winner!,I purchased this based on the recommendations of others on this website. It was a winner! My six month old son was in the water for the first time and loved it. The palm tree did a pretty good job of shading him and he did not tip over like some of the other floaties were doing. This was a great find! Thank you! I almost bought a different one until I read the ratings and found out everyone hated it. The suggestions brought me to this one and I was thrilled. We spent over an hour in the kiddie pool just hanging out! That was amazing to me for an infant!
1,Not Sam's best by any means.,"I know a lot of people will disagree with me, but this film is not for a true Peckinpaw admirer. There was nothing I really could get into. The plot was one that has been filmed more times than you can count. Even good actors couldn't save it for me. It was a far cry from the normal western or late 1800 type film Peckinpaw is noted for. This film was for a generation a lot younger than me. You old timers, get one of Sam's other movies, I liked them all with the Wild Bunch & Cable Houge the best."
3,Straw dogs.,I had never seen or heard of this movie before. I heard them talking about it on a documentary about A Clockwork Orange. They were saying how this was another controversial movie that came out at the same time. It is a good movie and I think it is worth owning. Not nearly as crazy as A clockwork Orange but still pretty racy for the early 70's.
4,Not an animal.,"Given the multiple reviews, I really only wish to comment on one aspect of the film, but one that is at it's heart. In the real world there really are people like the town bullies/thugs. Wherever found, their existence needs to be ended. In this film, after multiple points where this termination of existence should have occured, it finally does. D. goes from nothing to warrior. Not an animal in any way. A dangerous, thinking exterminator of evil. A good and honorable function. A necessary function."
3,Needs your complete attention.,This Hoffman movie is not his typical fare. It needs your complete attention to get all the nuances of his performance. It is a good movie for a rainy day.
3,Straw Dogs review,"Couple rent house in English countryside. Pet cat is killed, then the wife is raped while husband is duck shooting. Ends with extremely violent scene. Dustin Hoffman and Susan George star."
2,One Big Flaw-The Binder Ring opens at the top,I bought this folder to avoid having two thinner folders in order to hold all of my boss's emergency cards. This folder would have been great if it had a tab at the top as well as the bottom to keep the tension from top to bottom. The problem with not having a tab at the top is there is no tension to keep the binder ring from opening . Hence the papers slip through the top ring as you are flipping through pages and it's just one big hassle to deal with when you're trying to keep things organized and you end up with a different kind of mess.
3,9/16 pedal extenders,"I purchased these pedal extenders hoping to mitigate the affects of femoral/patellar syndrome on my left knee. I was a bit concerned that the radical (one full inch) extension would do more damage than good. I adjusted my cleat (I use the product on the left pedal only) outward reducing the effective extension to perhaps 5/8 inch - still fairly radical I feel. After about 350 miles I can't say for sure if the product is helping or not. My knee pain (actually more like an aggravating irritation) is still there though it doesn't seem to be getting worse, thus I intend to continue to use the product.These extenders are solid steel - should last just about forever. Delivery was fast and the price was right - less than $20 with shipping."
2,I've scouted that location myself.,"I thought that my knowledge of the rural Missouri/Illinois area near St. Louis would add to the interest of this book. Unfortunately, that's just about all of the plot that peaked any interest at all. The premise of a movie location scout becoming accidentally involved in a murder investigation had promise, but the story was very slow in developing. I kept putting the book down because I just got tired of reading. The real killer (pun intended) was that I just don't like Pellham, and when I don't like the main character, I have a very difficult time liking the story."
3,all you ever wanted to know about the work-up to WWI,"Even though this book was written over thirty years ago and the period has probably been subject to many revised histories, I found this book interesting because it gives the in-depth reasoning behind the actions of the various players. It includes lots of intrigues and gives a glimpse of flawed personalities. My only complaint is the writer uses personal pronouns when he should name the person and it's confusing to whom he's referring at times. It seems unbiased, but it's difficult to know if it really is without reading dozens of other books for the period. It is not a good book to go to sleep by, but is excellent when you feel the need to make yourself smarter."
2,does not cover the whole field,"The size of this book and the subtitle give the impression that this book covers the whole field. It doesn't. This hodgepodge of Ordinary Language and other approaches to the philosophy of literature is not the whole picture. See ""A Book Worth Reading"" for a different and systematic approach to this new branch of philosophy.The articles in this anthology are almost all by philosophers who have only a passing knowledge of literature. The results are sophistic and at time sophomoric.Missing also are some famous contributions to the field, such as Sartre's What is Literature? a book which raises some serious problems for literature. Also, the work of John M. Ellis.If you can afford it, buy all four books. If not, you're better off with A Book Worth Reading."
2,"Great book for all men, and the women who love them","I am a mental health professional and have required my male patients to read this work for many years. The best section is the ""myths"" about male sexuality. Highly recommend this book."
2,Dry and pedestrian,"Simon Tolkien might be a grandson of the famous author, but he didn't inherit much of his immense talent. This legal thriller is a pretty dry and pedestrian affair. It's cardboard characters, and contrived plot are matched with longwinded dialogue and luckluster ending. Good courtroom drama can bring oodles of suspense, but the bad and boring one can be nothing short of torture. Mr. Tolkin bemoans the trials and tribulations of an author who is related to a famous writer. My impression is that well known last name is the only reason that this book was published at all."
1,Worthless - don't waste your money.,"Does the above reviewer work for the software company??? Thank god for the 90 day return policy from Punch! because I am sending it back ASAP. I purchased this program because it supposedly has a feature where you can load a scan of your floor plan. This did not work at all and I tried various file configurations. Out of desperation to start with SOME sort of design plan, I tried to load one of their floor plans (they only have 20 plans to select from by the way-- very dissappointing), the software wouldn't load it because ""it could not read image."" I can't believe that the software wouldn't even load their own designs. Finally, I tried to draw my own plan from scratch and the whole screen started flashing/flipping out before I could get the lot lines drawn. Too bad. I really wanted this software to work -- I'm going to try Better Homes and Gardens in hope that I may be able to at least get started with my house plan."
3,A cool live album.,"This is a pretty enjoyable live album from Lizzy Borden. Their energy is just as good live as it is in the studio. My favorite songs from this collection are ""Give 'Em the Axe"" and ""American Metal."" The two songs that they recorded in the studio, ""Dead Serious (Wake Up)"" and ""Time to Die,"" are okay. The rest of the live songs aren't bad either. Worth a listen."
3,save your pennies,"I wholeheartedly agree with the gentleman from India. If you are nuts about Roxie Music, get the Streetlife CD. It is a truly great compilation. I was lucky enough to find it in a small record shop in New Orleans. It is truly excellent!"
2,Just a brief introduction to PhotoShop,"The book is very good as a brief introduction to PhotoShop, however if you are seriously involved into graphic design, you will need a lot more information. You could ""breeze"" through the book in five days, so if you buy it,prepare your wallets to spend money for the next one. If you create images as a hobby, the book might be just enough for you."
4,A Good Read,"This book is not exactly what I would call easy going. I've managed to get through half of it in 7 months. However, I can say, with absolute confidence, that if you do the problems you will learn.Most everything I've seen on category theory is a confusing mixture of different notations with seemingly identical meanings (but in fact the meanings are totally different). This book is no exception. Often, I have resorted to IRC to sort things out when some notation is simply impenetrable to me. My mathematical training stopped at complex calculus, so this may not apply to you if you've had abstract algebra or something a little more 'meta'.There seems to be one typographical error, but I am not sure. In the example on the adjunction between products and exponentiation, the right adjoint is listed as ""(_)^A x A"" but in the diagrams it ends up as ""(_)^A"". This may be a sensible ellision, but it is not explained anywhere in the text and of it's not easy to find these things on the internet."
4,What you have come to expect from Lonestar...,"I just purchased this cd after reading the reviews by other fans. I have not heard the whole album in its entirety but I did notice right away that that have consistantly produced the same kind of ear catchey music that keeps you listening and wanting more.I am eagerly also waiting for Sugarland and Keith Urbans new albums to be relased on November 7th.Oh, Lonestar has not released this album to be downloaded. I dont know why this is but I guess it is because they want the public to buy their music and not get it for free. I am glad I bought the cd. Now to listen, record and pass it on to another fan.....A die hard fan in St Louis - GO CARDINALS!!!!"
5,A new twist on an old classic,"I think this is a must have for the average metalhead. The musicianship is outstanding as always for Flotsam and Jetsam. A band that certainly didn't achieve the commercial success that they were very capable of. I have been a fan since the beginning. This, their first release, is fairly raw as far as recording quality, but awesome nonetheless. You can really hear their Sabbath, Judas Priest, and of course Iron Maiden influences in this one. Lots of dueling guitars and harmonys. And Eric ""A.K."" Knutson's wailing vocals are rivaled by only a few in my humble opinion. The bonus tracks and unreleased material in this re-release are a blast from the past also. They are raw, no doubt, but it is refreshing to hear the beginnings of a band that is still releasing albums as recent as last year's ""Dreams of Death"". This is an excellent buy, no doubt about it. Bonus DVD also."
3,"Good Exersizes, But There are Two Many","This was the first of five OBE books that I have read. I found the book helpfull in learning the fundementals i.e. relaxation. Yet, they have you go through too many tasks in the thirty days, and I don't beleive they talk about the vibes clear enough. I found that if you stick with the relaxation teckneques and only one of their meditation methods consistantly every day, I have had better results."
4,Spectacular Great!!,I got this soundtrack in as a demo at my music store and i found it very stimulating. I am so glad that The Propellerheads tracks featuring Miss shirly Bassey is on this cd. This cd is truley enjoyable.
4,Great Quality,"Just what I was looking for. The red is a bit more maroon than fire engine red, but it's of high quality and was a wonderful gift."
4,Interesting Cd,"This Cd contains interesting lyrics and tunes.However , it is not for the true beginner as there is some colloquialism and complex sentences."
3,Read by one with no interest in Buddhism,"This book started very disappointingly, with what I felt was a lot of leading the reader to conclusions. However, the authors seemed to abandon that tendency after the first few chapters. Certainly, there is a lot of text that reads like a sales brochure for Buddhism. There are a number of areas where they run off on tangents about loving your fellow man and achieving enlightenment and nirvana.Ignoring all that, there are many really thought-provoking and interesting discussions within, on the nature of the universe and our place in it. These authors get much more philosophical than the typical science text would, and that presents a much different perspective that's worthwhile."
2,Check Engine Light Came on the First Day,"I had someone stealing my gasoline out of my two cars. I purchased two locking caps, designated for each vehicle specifically, both made by the same company. For both automobiles, the check engine light came on during the first day of use. I took one car over and had the codes checked, and it came back as a ""pressure"" error for the tank, which is indicative of not putting the cap on tight. I didn't even bother having the other car's codes cleared. I used both caps until we moved out of that neighborhood, then I put the factory caps back on and had the codes cleared. I never had a check engine light come back on. These caps, while locking as designed, did not ""fit"" properly and allowed for gasoline vapors (or whatever) to escape. If you don't NEED a locking cap, don't buy this. I wouldn't consider it an ""upgrade."""
3,um....,"the only death metal thing about this cd is the singer. no speed, no haunting riffs, no crazy anti-melodic solos. the guitarist is very slow and not that good at all.. but..it isnt bad at all. its just not death metal. i like this cd. to me its just another hardcore cd just with a death singer (kinda like candiria...candiria is a lot better though)i like cannibal corpse a lot more. before getting this listen to some stuff by CC. these guys are probably the slowest un death metal death metal band i know right now. hehe...if u want the feel of a death metal singer but dont want to break your neck head banging this is for you."
3,"Well, it IS Chris Barnes...","... but I don't care! Barnes was the man when he was back in Cannibal Corpse, but now he is a mere shadow of what he used to be. However, being a mere shadow of his former self, he's still pretty good. The rest of the band is a different story, the music is too slow, and is very uninspired. In fact, its kind of boring. Out of all the SFU CDs I have, Each have ONE GOOD SONG.All in all, a decent CD for people just getting into death metal, but for people familiar to the genre, SFU leaves something to be desired... Well, at least its not some G@Y nu-metal cd! (other Bands that make SFU look like a sunday school choir: ZYKLON, Necrophobic, Cannibal Corpse, Death, The Crown (ex Crown Of Thorns on The Burning and Eternal Death) Emperor Callenish Circle) The list could go on for days, but im too lazy to keep typing."
5,Identical replacement for my Escalade 2007 serpentine tensioner pulley,This pulley is a plastic molded pulley with grooves which on my Escalade is actually the pulley on the tensioner. Ive been noticing some light squeaking on cold mornings so went ahead and ordered this pulley. It was an identical replacment. Took me all but 5mins to replace this pulley and problem solved. Not to mention once again Amazon beats the local stores and even placed like Rock Auto. And its prime shipping? Man........ How can you go wrong with AMAZON!
1,Don't buy,"Tough, cold weather? Huh? Maybe if you live in southern California. I am surprised these gloves are marketed this way. Whatever happened to truth in advertising...and Dewalt should be ashamed."
3,Cold weather work gloves,"This is actually the best gloves on the market for cold weather. They are light weight and not restricting. However, they would be excelant if they could provide the finger tips (the most impotant item concerning warm weather work gloves) with more warmth."
2,The GL2 is an unreliable camera,After just one and a half years of use representing around 200 hours of filming the manual zoom function acquired a mind of its own. There is no true manual zoom on this cam so if the internal logic that interfaces the zoom buttons both top and side goes whacky you lose control of zoom. This camera also has a real and serious focus lag problem if you do any sports/action shooting.Optics and image quality are tops in its class but what difference does that make if you can't control the friggin zoom!
4,Used but very good,I purchased the camera used in a very good condition i received it very well nice working very good and seemed to be in a very good shape as the seller stated. The only thing it was a little dusty i guess from packaging and the shipment but anyway i cleaned it and its like new.You'll enjoy shooting with it very nice features for the camera :)
2,Add an extra thousand dollars to the cost,This camera is SPECTACULAR!!!! For about a year or two.Then the system tape rejection errors start (do your research). Once this happens it's to the canon repair shop you must go where they are currently charging $516 for the parts plus $400 for the labor plus taxes and shipping etc. I am now throwing my GL2 in the trash and saving up to buy a new one. Canon's repair costs are outrageous - especially when this problem has been complained about for YEARS. A Canon rep even told me to never use the camera to play or offload videos (why advertise it as a feature if its such a bad idea?). He advised that you should buy a cheaper video camera to do those types of tasks. Good advise.... but even if you do... remember to add that cost to the purchase price of the GL2- Disgruntled.
3,Better than Home video,"We needed a good camera for a worship service that we were adding out our church. I found this camera for a great price, and it has done what we needed it to. However, it does not video in HD, and therefore, we have a need for another camera now."
4,Monumental recording in the history of jazz,"Why only four stars ? Because,for a few more bucks, you can buy the complete sessions,a two cd-set including a complete cd of rehearsals; and these rehearsals are gems; so,if you're able to buy the 2 cd set, don't hesitate. BUt if you can't, this one will amaze you; Duke's piano playing has rarely been captured as on this day,and Louis is superlative.Each tune is a masterpiece,Louis' voice is outstanding all through the record,and Duke's piano is great : listen to ""I'm just a lucky so and so"" for example.I used to listen to this record for 25 years, as far as I can remember,but certainly more,because my parents owned it and played it frequently; I was a child,and it was a great shock to me,just as Louis' ""good book"" and ""hot five"" recordings.Personnaly, I'll treasure this reunion forever."
1,Don't read this if you're post-op!,"Due to a rare complication of my pregnancy I underwent a life-saving emergency hysterectomy. I thought I was having a great recovery until I read this book. Suddenly every little twinge reminded me of the horror stories I'd read about. This is not the book to read AFTER you've had the surgery! I feel the author's pain and suffering in her personal experience with this surgery, but for some of us it's not an elective. It's useless to agonize and 'what-if' after the fact."
1,"Mono splitter, not described as such","Be careful with this item. It splits the left and right channels instead of providing stereo through on both inputs. Fortunately I can find another use for it, but I imagine most people won't. If you're looking to bounce a signal out to two sets of headphones or another stereo application, look for something that is specifically described as a stereo splitter."
2,Eh...,"It does what it's supposed to...but it's very cheaply made. Wire's are THIN! Would not use this if you will be plugging and unplugging a lot. If you use it backwards for two sound inputs, the volume will be lower if you have both plugged in, unplug one and the sound volume should go up."
4,good for the price,"sometimes shakes and interrupts sound but for the price i paid, its a really good deal. would recommend to anyone looking for cheap but effeective"
1,It doesn't work,You can only hear mono audio from one earbud when using this don't get it. I tried it on my iPod touch I swear
1,"Terrible, don't waste your money.","My expectations were low for $4.00 but I was shocked to see how terrible this item really was, I have tried it on several devices with several sets of headphones and the sound quality is absolutely terrible. The sounds is barely audible at any level and when you can hear it the signal is poor, stay away."
1,Written in 1950s,"First of all, this program was written in the 50s and has a whole section on sending a telegraph.Secondly, if you are a beginner, this program is impossible to follow. Lesson 1 starts with: Hello; Hola. How are you? Como esta? I would like to make an appointment to speak with Mr. Gonzalez; ????? It continues in this vain mixing in simple words and then complete sentences that do not incorporate those words.My wife and I listened to the whole program once and will never use it again. A waste of money even at the $5 I spent."
1,Hated It,"This is a cd of english to spanish words, followed by phrases. I found it hard to follow and easy to ignore. I tried giving it away to a friend wanting to learn spanish and he gave it back! Possibly may be better for someone with a base understanding already?"
5,X-Cops awesome!,"GWAR is great, and these guys are just spawns, babies or misfits of GWAR... good stuff. too bad they do not do more or something. solid CD."
1,Hahahah,"To the person below me: Just because it's on MTV, it doesn't mean it's any good. The sorry state of mainstream music these days...."
3,somebody told me there where killers on the loose.,The Killers hot fuss is definately lead by somebody told me. This is quite a relaxed and slow album which you would expect could put a baby to sleep after it had been asleep all day. It surtanly dosn't represent rock as you would expect to be loud and heavy. it makes change. But if they are indie as 'glamorouse indie rock and roll' says then they should stick to the indie chart 'cause they won't be killin the top 40 to well.
1,Amazon never shipped my order,"Hard to review when I never received my order placed on February 24, 2007 from Amazon."
3,Fastfood music.,"Yes, they are immitating a style. And yes they are kinda fake (at least the accent is). And yes, they are hollow, silly, commercial etc, etc. I guess every negative remark about The Killers anywhere by anyone is justified in some way.But in the end they've written a good handfull of extremly catchy and clever songs. They may be the musical equivalent of fastfood, but I do crave some fastfood every once in a while."
3,Just don't expect too much,"Of course the ""Mr. Brightside"" hit is wonderful and the rest of the album is worth listening too. Don't expect too much and you won't be let down. The Killers just don't seem to go all the way. It seems like they are good for at least one song per CD but it would be interesting to hear them push all the way through to where they seem to be going."
3,More like 3.5 stars,"I am unashamed of the fact that I'm one of the biggest Cure fans walking the earth today. I heard ""Mr. Brightside"" in August while driving home at about 1am and thought, ""wow, they have something here."" The Killers then fell out of my mind for a couple of weeks unitl I saw their CD at Newbury Comics and figured I'd give it a shot. This band would be far better off if their singer (Brandon) didn't try to sound like Robert Smith or Richard Butler. His voice isn't confident, and it's too ""loungey"" for the music. The music is another problem... it's all very well done (too well done) and you can tell that Pro Tools was ABUSED during these studio sessions. There are absolutely no sonic nuances, the ""new-wave"" synths are buried in the mix, and the guitar & bass sound are perfect (ie no mistakes). Very few bands are lucky enough to get a major label contract right away, but if I were in The Killers, I would've been sure that my album wasn't filled with over-produced dribble."
5,Best Album of the Last Decade,"I think Hot Fuss might quite possibly be the best album of the last decade. EVERY song has a great hook. Back when I used a CD changer in my office, this is the album that stayed in it month after month while all of the others around it were replaced. Simply terrific."
5,The Killers,This cd was great i heard it at one of my friends house and i thought it sounded like The Cure (a good late 70's 80's band) just a little bit. i liked the rock mixed with techno and the drums are good if you just listen to them. i listen to this cd quite often about 3 months actually and it never has gotten old. so if you are looking for something new that sounds good get this.
4,Near Perfect Pop Music,"From some of the reviews below it would appear that pop music has become a dirty word - or two! The Killers may not have the sense of importance of Interpol (who actually steal quite liberally from Joy Division), and sure, they appear to be complete musical kleptomaniacs but in a sense it does not matter if the ideas are put together to create a new whole. So whilst the band wears its influences on it's collective sleeve there is no denying the rush of sheer, grin causing pleasure I experienced on hearing ""Mr. Brightside"" or ""Jenny"". The band does seem to run out of ideas by the end of the album though which is a shame. At least 5 of the tracks however are near perfect pop music, in all it's cheap, disposable glory, and although this album may not stay on your player for years to come I've found it to be the perfect summer companion."
2,"Derivative, painfull, obnoxious","Do you like listening to music that was made in the 80s. Do you want to be uber hip, have a trendy hair cut, and impress all your friends with your nostalgic love of an early simpler time. Do you feel that you some how missed out by never being able to see Duran Duran during their hayday. Are you 15 and need that special record to really please the girl of your dreams.Then look no further then this overhyped, no talent 80s revival rip off artist, the killers. Knowing that some dork Mormon( Brandon Flowers) from Vegas who loved Moz so much decided to make form a band based solely off of the fictional band from a New Order video is bad enough. Having to listen to this trite crap is worse.(...)"
2,Somebodys listened to the Strokes a little too much,"Yuck. Well maybe that's too strong a reaction. Rather more like: ........ zzzz. Heard it all before, nothing even remotely original or interesting about this band. I don't necessarily turn it off when I hear it on the radio, but for the most part it's just more top 40 overhyped mush, i.e. it's derivitive and dull. I kept hearing how these guys are the next big thing. If that's true then rock is surely dead. There are better bands out there folks, trust me.Oh yeah, the '80s were TWENTY f-ing years ago, get a clue. What will people say about the 2000s? What characterises this decade? I'll tell you what: it's the decade where bands imitated music of the past except without the wit or imagination that made the music interesting in the first place. Mindcandy for TV people. Go back to sleep junior, music is just entertainment: I keep forgetting that it shouldn't be something more. Trendy, trendy."
2,"So we're all up for nostalgia, are we?","The Killers are another one of these retro-revivalists who've made it big. They're here honing in on those who've always had a soft spot for new wave hits. Who have enjoyed The Cure and Depeche Mode, who like their songs a little darker but still upbeat. Are they any good? Not exactly but they do show signs of promise. Somebody Told Me is not bad as a song as it has the androgynous tongue-twister chorus that is an update of Blur's Girls And Boys. The rest however is a little sub-standard really. Tossed off in a rush and sounding a bit like the also-rans of Britpop ten years ago. The music is nothing exciting though. As with most retro-revival acts, it treads on thin ice. It's only a matter of time before it cracks and then we'll see whether they sink or swim."
5,Loveeee me some killlers,I will admit that i do like Sams Town better.But none the less this album is still absolutey fabolous.The Killers and Coldplay are the only 2 bands albums where i can listen to there albums without skipping songs.This band is just so fantasic in so many differnt ways and for all you people who think that they are just another average band i seriously think that is so false.Other than Franz Ferindad i really dont know any other band like The Killers.And even Franz doesn't really stand up to The Killers.Also these guys are mind blowing live.I've recentyl attended there concert in Atlanta and it was the best show i've been to.I will be a killers fan for a long long time and there cd's will never leave my car cd player lol
2,somewhat ok,"Take away 80% of the creativity, melody and uniqueness of the Talking Heads and the Pixies, throw in some mid 80's glam rock, and you're left with the Killers.Now it's not entirely a bad album- sometimes the vocals work, though more often than not the lead singer leaves me completely cold.If people seriously think the Killers are one of the best bands from the last several years, I have to strongly disagree. We need a band with a more original sound and definitely more creativity as far as vocal melodies and background arrangements go. This is basically commercial rock similar to Green Day but slightly better, that's all."
5,I've got soul but I'm not a soldier,"I first saw the killers when they opened for stellastarr* back in April. I can still remember the concert as people would turn to their friends and just say ""damn this is good."" The Killers put on an awesome show for that reason i counted the days down till the cd came out. This cd is AWESOME! With Jenny was a friend opening the cd hits the ground running, Mr. Brightide, Smile like you Mean it (a song that really grew on me).... There isnt a weak song in there. If you like the Killers look into Stellastarr and Elefant for great and unique rock just as the Killers have accomplished with Hot Fuss."
3,Good Debut,"Man the hook of that first single (Somebody Told Me), it's addictive, great song, the rest of the album? I'd say two other tracks that stand out to me are Mr. Brightside and Midnight Show. Other tracks just seem to be average, the album just came out so more songs might grow on me... The only point of reference I think of for this album is think of The Sounds, but replace Maja with a guy have a little harder/darker edged sound. Oh and if you're planning to see them live, I happened to catch them on Kimmel, and they were pretty good."
3,so much more could have been put on here...,"Come on. If you're going to rerelease this amazing album, give us MORE than just 3 bonus tracks. We should have gotten ALL the import single B-sides, including really hard to find tracks like Show You How, Get Trashed, and Who Let You Go. and with so much space on one disc, they should have thrown in some of the remixes of the 2 big hits to make this a really worthy ""limited edition"" for the fans. Fans looking for the Mylo mix of ""Somebody Told Me"", long out of print on import CD single, should check out the compilation ""Twisted"". It's on there in it's full length, along with a ton of other retro sounding alternative bands."
5,amazing album,"I bought this album in august and didn't stop playing it in my car till october. They have a unique sound, and the none of the songs sound the same. Very cool songs, e.g. Jenny was a friend of mine, Smile like you mean it, Andy you're a star.They also sound really good live."
1,overrated garbage,"this is utter trash. The Lyrics are terrible, his vocals are horrible, how can anyone like this crap? it's just another one of these trendy bands that think it's cool to sound ""retro""."
5,This CD freakin rocks,"I love this CD. Buy this CD (you probably already have). I was living under a rock in 2004 and totally missed the best album of the decade thus far. I cannot say enough about the Killers debut album, it is AMAZING."
4,Different in an odd way,"At first i liked the song ""somebody told me"" but not enough to buy the album. then when i heard ""mr. brightside"" i decided to give it a try. at first i was very dissapointed but it's grown on me.the only song on it similar to ""Mr. brightside"" is ""on top"" (one of my favorites) there are two songs with a gospel choir at the end and at first that bothered me but now i like it more.i think its good that we have a band as innovative and creative as the killers. if you liked the first two singles i'd say you will deffinietly like the cd. but it may take some time to grow on you."
3,Gets a bit lost,"I did like this cd, and it certainly does have its good points. The first 2 songs, Mr. Brightside and Jenny was a Friend of mine are amazing and leave you expecting more. Unfortunatly though I think that after this great start the album loses it a bit. The songs start to sound the same and this is not a CD you can listen to again and again and again. Indie Rock and Roll is really bad- it grates on me and I have to skip it (if I get that far into the album before finding something more interesting to listen to). I reckon you'd be better of downloading the two aforementioned tracks (And maybe Somebody Told Me) and giving the rest a miss."
4,Solid effort,"I know I like an album when I can listen to most of the songs without having the impulse to skip to the next song (or the one or two after that [or another album]). With one or two exceptions, everything on this collection is enjoyable to listen to and reflects a 21st-century band with more than a little talent. I bought the album because I'd heard the band's ""Boots"" song (which isn't on ""Hot Fuss,"" mind you) and was pleasantly surprised. Bush'sGolden Stateis similar. No outstanding commercial hits, necessarily, but consistent quality in every song."
4,Something Different,"I saw the band performing on Pepsi Smash, and liked their sound so much I took a chance and bought the cd. Thank God for luck, because the cd is nothing short of great. It had a certain 80's vibe to it, and it's something different from what's already out there. Some of the songs do sound the same, but for the most part, it's a great cd.Stand out songs include ""Mr. Brightside"", ""Somebody Told Me"", ""On Top"", and ""Midnight Show"". I might skip one song on the entire cd, but all of the songs are good, so I could deal without skipping any.If you're looking for a new band to listen to and you're not sure who, I recommend that you look into the Killers. You will not be disappointed.. or at least I hope not concidering how I've been raving about this cd for the last few lines.."
5,Remarkable,"This is the most beautiful book ever written on the Holy Mother. I've worn out two copies of the book - it can never be read enough. It has continued to inspire, lead and comfort me for over forty years. Together with my Bible there is no book I hold more dear or more precious. I am not Catholic, yet I love Mary. Sip at this sweet nectar and it will only get sweeter with each sip and more, it will nourish your soul with the deepest love of Our Lady."
4,A Journey Well Worth The Effort,"If you are familiar with the characters Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb, there is really no mystery here. But, as they say, it's not the destination that is important, but the journey itself. Connelly's writing is fast paced and streamlined. We are not given large doses of non-essential information just to prolong the story, as happens with quite a few other authors these days. We learn a little more about Harry but he remains a mystery, and that is the hook. A journey well worth the effort."
4,"One of the ""best"" offered by this fantastic author.","This book brings the best out of Michael Connelly. He has brought great characters from past works and interjects them into this book. I am very impressed. One who may be considering reading ""A Darkness More Than Night"" should read some of Michael Connelly's earlier books so that these characters will be more familiar in relationship to Detective 3 Harry Bosch. ""A Darkness More Than Night"" is a must read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A Fun Read,"It was very interesting to have 2 of Connelly's character interacting in this book. However,I did not find the plot as credible as his usual plots...not his best but a fun read anyway."
2,more is definitively less,"I am a big Connelly fan , but this one is dissapointing. the pairing of his two strongest characters, far from improving the novel, weakens it, as Mc Caleb's assumptions are not believable for anyone who has read the previous Bosch novels, and this makes the ending obvious quite early in the book. I Agree with the reviews which pointed out mostly the same objections; the only true Connelly touch is the revelation about Bosch's REAL part in Gunn's crime. Mc caleb has no dimension as a character and comes accross weak, linear and his domestic troubles are predictable and boring. Bosch should stand alone in the future, he's a fascinating character who can sustain a book in his own right"
4,Intelligent entertainment,"Having read the book just 3 weeks after visiting Avalon, Catalina, I found myself enjoying the book more than I would have otherwise. The book is overall very entertaining, intelligent, and very easy to read. The ending might be predictable but the way the story comes together is quite good. Except for a few minor character/plot points that were never quite explained (spoiler; i.e., why did the apartment manager take the owl to the other building?) and a somewhat over imaginative ""profiling"", this is definitely worth the read."
5,"Connell, the master","As always, Michael Connelly provides an interesting, accurate, and tight story. After reading so many of his works, I feel that I know Harry Bosch. It is a pleasure watching how the man works."
3,Harry vs Terry,"After getting to know Terry McCaleb in Blood Work, I'd hoped his second outing would come out better than this. He enters into Darkness having shed several IQ points. That he was dumb enough to conclude that Harry Bosch was a brand new serial killer on the rise is a huge liability to McCaleb's reputation.I like learning about Heironymous Bosch, the artist. These details give the faithful readers of the series (who haven't gone out and research the subject) an even deeper look into Det. Bosch's psyche. Like layers on the proverbial onion, Harry is peeled down to the core, giving readers an exceptional character on multiple levels.The undisputed winner in the throwdown between these two sleuths is Harry, by far and away. The more pages Terry filled, the more it seemed like he needed to just stay home with his wife and family.A Darkness More than Night is a pretty good read, especially for Connelly lovers, as it ties up some loose ends left over from previous novels."
5,ANOTHER GREAT ONE!!!!,"Connelly has done it again. Another very, very good book. This one is as much about Terry McCaleb as Harry Bosch. Terry is asked to come help find the killer of Eddie Gunn. Even though Terry is supposed to be retired he agrees to help. Guess who all the evidence points to? Yes, Harry Bosch, did Harry really kill Gunn? To prove he did not, Harry only has a few days to find the true killer. The book will hold your attention. You will not want to put it down until the end. I could gladly slap the face of Jack McEvoy, the reporter, but Connely can write so you feel that way about a character. If you like a good mystery you will enjoy this one."
3,NOT Mr CONNELLY'S BEST WORK!,"Enjoy the Harry Bosch stories a lot, always interesting and exciting, full of fully fleshed characters, have enjoyed the McCaleb stories as well, but not quite as much.This story, having both Bosch AND McCaleb together, didn't quite work for me - maybe because the case/s were too predictable.Not Michael's best work."
5,As different as day and night.,"I did not know what to expect I had never read a Connelly novel before. The person who had recommended the book to me told me that the author had drawn characters into the story from his past books. I feared something akin to a bad high school class reunion. McCaleb and Bosch. Knowing that the author had written about two these guys in the past I worried about the back-story that I did not have. ""You like fast paced mysteries,"" my friend said. ""I like Nelson DeMille,"" was my reply. ""I don't like class reunions. I don't like jumping into the middle of something."" So with some reluctance I read A Darkness More Than Night. The book was good. Good plot, good writing, good characterizations, killer ending, go buy it"
4,A different view of Bosch,"A Bosch yarn that has Bosch as a victim, rather than as a hero. The hero is an unlikely heart-transplant recipient, so there's some interesting aspects of what such a man experiences."
5,Bosch & McCaleb team up,"Harry Bosch is usually chasing killers, but this time he might be the killer. In this installment of the Harry Bosch series, Connelly turns the tables on Bosch for a little bit. But don't worry, Bosch is determined to find out who set him up to take the fall in a brutal murder. Fans of Bosch and Connelly won't be disappointed. And Connelly's pairing of Bosch and Terry McCaleb(Blood Work) is a winning combination!"
4,Another good Harry Bosch novel,"What can I say, I just found Michael Connolly this year and have already read the first 7 Harry Bosch novels. I know I will finish them all this year."
1,do not waste your money and time,"One word,skip it.It s not worth it.People are tired of reading the everlasting fight of good vs evil.The emotional drainage the heroes(good guys) go through to fight evil and bring it to justice.I regretted buying the book.IT is highly unrealistic(not neccessarily a bad point for a fiction book) but worse of all it is boring with a capital B.Bosch and Mc Caleb can not cut the mustard anyway you look at it.Better luck next time Mr. Conelly."
4,Two stories in One,"Like many of Michael Connelly's novels, the early character development cuases the story to drag somewhat but stick with it as the last half is worth the wait."
4,Vile is awesome,"I love this band, period and have heard almost all their stuff. Vile is a GREAT CC album. If you like them you will love it. Forget anyone saying different. Prepare for a sore neck though. This stuff ROCKS.Devoured By Vermin is probably my #1 CC song ever made."
4,Fifth CD of horrific slaughter and murderous lust,"After the release of Chris Barnes as vocalist and the gaining of George ""Corpsegrider"" Fischer, CC has come out with another amazing Technical Death CD. The sound isn't as defined as on ""The Bleeding"", but they fit George's harsh vocals perfectly. The lyrics have taken on the same sort of diversity CC had in the days of ""Eaten Back To Life"", from ""Puncture Wound Massacre""- a song of pure violence and bloodshed, to ""Bloodlands""- a song with an almost quasi-Epic feel. One new twist, the one rape song on the CD tells the raping of a man, intersting after the long years of CC's brutalizing of women. A little different from their others, still a great Death Metal CD. Censored version does NOT contain the lyrics or the full album cover, as it is with all CC albums. END"
1,horrible as always!,"THis band doesn't improve. Incredible! THey always play the same stuff, what means: nothing."
5,Cannibal Corpes Rules,The Best death metal EVER! All you little wusses that are disgusted by this can shut the Hell up! If you don't like them then just don't buy their CD.
4,PSA?,"I guess when this film was made, it was intended to be some sort of cautionary tale or public service announcement. Looking at it today it just seems silly and hysterical. But as always, if you bought the Rifftrax version you knew this when you bought it. The guys do a great job with their comments, and you'll be laughing from start to finish. If you're an MST3K/Rifftrax fan, you won't be disappointed."
4,Reefer Madness Riff Tracks,This was a gift for Christmas so I cannot vouch for the quality of the dvd. I can say it arrived in excellent condition and considerably faster than I expected. The recipient was very happy upon opening his gift.
2,"Mostly Filler, Very Little Killer","Maybe I'm biased against this book because I was required to read it for school, but most of the other books we have read I have loved. This one just annoyed me. It seemed like when you read it there were always certain parts in the book that just didn't need to be there. Filler. If I had taken out all the filler in this book, it would have been at least half as thick. Maybe I'm just not into these kinds of books (although I like most books no matter what they're about), but I found it hard to focus on because of all the unnecessary information, and kind of boring. I personally do not recommend this book."
1,jaimelire,"This is no Lord of the Rings!!!! Where do people got this idea??? Lost interest in the poorly written story after 25% reading into it, mostly because I hoped the story would get off the ground. The conflict between Jasper and Ged is unfounded... totally weak plot.Not worth time and money"
2,Overrated,"So often it seems like an adequate book is well loved just because it appears in an ""unusual"" genre. If this book was about anything but wizards, it would be considered mildly entertaining, but not much else. I found it neither very intellectually stimulating, nor focused around an incredible plot. Of course, people can like what they like, but I feel like this book was a real let down."
4,A Fantasy Great,"Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle has found its place among the great fantasy series of the time. With a vast, colorful, and incredibley original world, readers can't help but feel drawn in. In this first book, we meet Ged, and follow his early adventures. The plot is intriguing, if feeling a bit rushed at times, though a pleasure to read all the same. This quick read leaves you wanting more, which you get if you continue reading the series."
3,A great introduction to the genre for child/teenage readers,"I picked up this book for my love of fantasy and the reputation of Le Guin. I found the story to be very simple and standard fare for fantasy. The young hero sets out on a quest to save himself/the world. During the quest, he increases his skills and matures emotionally. There are many similarities between this book and The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss (one of my favorites). La Guin does break the mold a bit by subtly including non-white lead characters and strong female characters which were tough to find in the genre at the time this book was written."
4,A Wizard of Earthsea review,"The book, A Wizard of Earthsea, was a good book, but it is kind of hard to understand at first, but as you get farther into the book, it is easier to understand. I like the part where he sets the evil shadow into the world, and when he finally captures it by a clever plan. He also has a very nice friend, Estarriol, who helps him after he releases the evil shadow into the world, and he went with him when he went to capture it, even though Ged didn't want him to go with him."
5,Relevant to adult ages as well as younger ages,"Read LeGuin's Earthsea Trilogy over 25 yrs. ago in college, and re-read them recently. Just as thought-provoking as ever and picked up on small details which I'd missed on first reading yrs. ago.Never fails to amaze me how LeGuin's depth of character portrayal (Ged in Wizard of Earthsea) and her depiction of life/death and beyond issues in simple profound terms, are endless delight to read and re-read for fresh insights. All of the Earthsea books can stand alone - a great writer is one whose books endings' always come too quickly! Recommend these books to adults who seek the ""true Names of all things""."
4,Very Cool Book,"This book is so cool. He holds power of wizard, slays a dragon, and even finds out the name of the dark shadow that which haunts him. I like the series of Earthsea and wish to finsh the 4 books of Earthsea."
2,Harry Potter? More like Beowulf.,"I have been hearing about this book for years and years and never got around to reading it. I finally did, and totally hated it. The prose was very lyrical, but there was hardly any characterization to speak of, and the plot can be summed up as ""wizard chases his shadow"". It was a very boring, albeit poetically written, story. It reads like an epic poem, flowing writing, but hard to connect with.Whoever recommended this as an ""if you liked Harry Potter, then..."" is totally off the mark. J.K. Rowling may have been inspired by the wizard school and coming of age story in this book, but the resemblence stops there. This book is completely devoid of the warmth, humor, and delightful reading experience found in Rowling's books. It is 100% exposition. It is more like a modern-day Beowulf than an old-school Harry Potter."
4,"Pretty Good Book, Different From Others I've Read","I thought A Wizard of Earthsea was a pretty good book. Because it isn't modern, it wasn't very humorous, but sometimes books don't have to be funny to be enjoyable. Ged (Sparrowhawk) travels through some pretty interesting adventures, and he learns about courage, wisdom, friendship, and masters the art of wizardry along the way. The mysterious and evil magic he encounters almost takes him in, but with the help of his friend Erastarriol (Vetch), he overcomes it and learns that their is nothing better in life than friendship. This book wasn't your typical Harry Potter or other type of magical book, it felt much more ancient as I was reading it, and to me that made it more mythical and enchanting. I've rated this book 4 stars out of 5, but maybe the next book in the cycle will be even better."
5,WOW! can I say more?,"The earthsea quartet was wonderful. I've read it many times. It takes you on ups, and downs. You see suspence, fear, humor, love, anything you could ask fore. Ged is my hero! These were such great books, and I think everyone should read them!"
5,"PC Hodegell, PE Zimmer, D Gemmell are her only peers.","An almost unparalleled piece of fanatsy writing, beautifully rendered world in so few pages, many of todays supposedly great fantasy writers could take a few hints from Ursula. Her mythos is complete, the way magic works logical and the duality of that exsists in all life and death brilliantly written. The book is about Ged and his rite of passage from boy to powerful wizard. A journey of one facing his fears, of accepting them as part of who is....literally! A great read for young peaple and adults alike. Enjoy a truly magical piece of litreature."
5,What an interesting book!,"This was a lovely book. It is quite thoughtful,creative, dramatic, and even kind of bonechilling in some parts (such as when the boy first discovers the spell for calling up the dead). Le Guin also did well at creating a mood for this darkish story, which takes place in a fascinating land known as the Archipelago. My only complaint is the lack of strong female charachters, and the confusing balance of magic. However, this only slighty takes away from the story. My favorite part in the book was probably when the boy was being taught at Roke.Followed by three sequals"
1,This book sucked big!!!!!!,"I hated this book. It had a boring plot, it was hard to understand. It is one of the worst fantasynovels I have ever read."
2,"I know, I must be a heritic, but did not care for it.","I saw the TV show made, so I wanted to check out the full story.It was a disappointment, but my wife loved it. So there you are one against, one for it."
3,Just to help you figure this out,"umm... a couple of ppl don't get how ged knew the shadow's name in the end. The reason is because the shadow is part of him so in the end, ged just says his own name to the shadow and everything is happy again. thats why i rated only three because after all that suspense, i didn't get it in the ned and a friend had to explain it.Who knows? I could be a ditz and im the only one who didn't get it???? Neway, it's an alright book but the descriptions are really, really boring so i just skipped them, heehee!worth reading if u can be bothered"
3,This book was ok,This book was kind of hard to follow. I thought it was a little too much fiction for me. I like books that are right on the edge of fiction and nonfiction.
1,Unreadable; just drivel,"I should have paid heed to the 30 reviewers who dunked the book. It is absolutely unreadable, unbelievable story-line and those maps, as if 100 countries/islands are jammed together.Book flies to the bin, I am not going to spare a single second thinking of this garbage."
4,Excellent movie with realistic negotiation tactics,"I had seen this movie many times over the past few years, but decided to buy it to incorporate into a presentation I recently did on Crisis/Hostage Negotiation. It was the first time that I watched the movie with the intent of evaluating the accuracy of the movie's portrayal of actual negotiations. I was surprised how accurate the negotiation processes were portrayed in the movie...it matched many of the conflict communication theories I studied.On the entertainment side, getting Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson together in the movie surely didn't hurt. Good cast, decent story line, well put together and enjoyable to watch."
3,Pretty Darn good flick - 3.5 Stars.,"I reserve the 4 and 5 Stars for the really, really, exceptional movies.This was, however, a very good action flick. I wouldn't watch this one again, but it was good for one shot! The scenario is pretty typical, hostages, stand-off on the high floor of an office building, swat teams, sharp-shooters, bad cops, good cops, no real gory stuff and not a lot of blow-em apart scenes, no overdone sex stuff either. Excellent performances by the leads. Worth watching... albeit once."
4,Good Cast; Intense Story,"The movie sports an interesting cast, actors who usually entertain, such as Kevin Spacey, Samuel L. Jackson, J.T. Walsh, David Morse and Paul Giamatti. Spacey, as ""The Negotiator,"" has the best role.The story is interesting and very intense in spots and keeps you involved without the need for a lot of violence. There is just the right amount in here and the film looks very good on DVD.At 138 minutes, the film would have been better being trimmed 10-15 minutes. It could also been less profane. Over 70 f-words is too many. I get tired of seeing cops portrayed as dirty most of the time or just trigger-happy. It ain't so, at least as often as Hollywood likes to show you. Finally, the end stretches credibility just a little too much.Overall, however, this is definitely worth seeing but with a big caution light with the language. for those wondering about family viewing."
1,Too much drama,A friend told me alot about this movie and I happened to buy this movie from Wal-Mart and I watched it and it doesnt sound the same as what my friend told me about. This movie is about drama and crime and she knows I am not into drama and crime so I made her buy the DVD from me. I am not too interested in this movie.
3,"SPACEY GOOD, JACKSON BAD","A predictable but entertaining movie with a great performance by Kevin Spacey in a conventional and cliched thriller. The first half is awful, but once Sam Jackson takes Internal Affairs office hostage and Spacey enters the film, it takes flight. Samuel L. Jackson gives a horrible performance, though (watch him cry at the funeral and his ""I'm off that bus"" speech). The commentary given in the Amazon reiview is false; the DVD wasn't released with it."
5,Seersucker loungert,This lounger is really light weight- perfect for warmer weather. This is the second one like this that I got since the first one in size M was actually too big.
4,Grey Owl,"There's no denying that Grey Owl is not the best movie ever made, but it is a good, inspirational tribute to a remarkable and unique Canadian who was an early and almost lone voice in advocating the protection of Canada's wilderness, which by the 1930s was already being despoiled by over-exploitation of game and natural resources."
4,Some of the better info out there,"This book is over 80 years old, but its subject is many centuries old- so that is not really an issue. The descriptions can be a bit esoteric at times. It's fairly short. It is not exactly a page turner, the some parts can seem repetitive if you are reading big chunks without listening to the music as well. However, I think it is one of the best books on Indian music I've found in English. If you are looking for a good guide to assist in listening to and understanding great classical Indian music, this book serves that purpose very well. If you are looking for a book that includes contemptorary Indian musicians and has pictures of George Harrison, there are other books out there that can offer that kind of thing."
4,Zeus,"Only caution, this is the British version so it doesn't integrate with American updates/addons. My Poseidon adventure will not work with this Zeus master."
5,ZEUS REVIEW,"The game is amazing I had lost my old copy and needed to find a new one and amazon is where I found it. I ordered it on a Friday and I had it within 2 weeks, which is the time period I was told. I would for sure buy more games from amazon."
1,Homophobia Revived,"In the early 1970's I first read the first edition of this book. In particular, the chapter on gay male sexuality was appalling. Filled with stereotypes and ignorance and treating bathroom sex as typical of how gay men relate sexually, I will never forget it. In his latest edition there is almost no improvement in his treatment of male-male sexuality. To him, gay men are still denizens of bathrooms and bathhouses. He does not seem to conceive of the idea that two men could manifest physical love to each other. From a mechanical standpoint he is also laughingly and hopelessly mis-informed. Why did the publisher revive this homophobic work?"
2,Lots of Good Information -- Still has misinformation,"This book still is an intriguing read. I read this when it was first published and did not have enough knowledge to know what was inaccurate and what was opinion and what was fact. However, I did feel quite naughty and knowledgeable reading it at the time. It's scary to think how close I came to having an unwanted baby because of the birth control method mentioned in the original: shaken coca cola. (Imagine a cheap motel, a broken condom, and a scared young man running for bottled cola.) It's not forbidden to talk about sex any more, so you don't get the added status the original one gave to teenagers."
3,Iffy,this play covers the main parts and plots of the book but misses more then its worth. i have done the play and read the book after words and wow. theres a diffrence there.
5,Great personal study,"this series is great for individuals or a group. Some questions are a bit personal, and sharing in a group may not be what one would want to do, but we just skip over those questions and carry on. The use of looking up Scripture and applying it personally is one thing that my group likes about these studies."
4,Warn,"This items fits very well and it warm. I wore it on a recent trip to the Arctic, and I could not complain, but the sizes do tend to run small (a Helly Hansen thing I think), so keep that in mind when purchasing."
4,comfortable long underwear,"These long underwear are form fitting, warm and lightweight. Fits well under all garments, even dress pants. I recommend them."
2,NOT UP TO PAR,CONSCIOUS by Julie Dexter was a very big dissappointment. It was my first CD by this artist and might just be the last. This is one of the CD's you buy and listen to it and then set it aside for your next yard sale. There is just nothing special here.
2,hasnt aged well,"i bought season 1-3 of SNL. although we used to think it was funny back then, it hasnt aged wellthe jokes are very old. we are all very disappointed in that fact. it started to get funny mid 2nd season.shame. not recommended, at least not for that price."
4,The founding fathers of awesome sketch comedy!,"Bill Murray, along with other Greats make you feel good, and laugh hard as hell!!"
2,Come apart and no wrench to put it back together,"The back of this cone center is a threaded disk with two holes for a two pin spanner wrench. So far, I haven't found a wrench to fit, which is too bad, because the back comes loose frequently. With no wrench, I end up trying to tighten it up with my fingertips pressed against the plate.I don't trust this center not to come apart in the middle of a project and kill me, so I end up not using it. If I could find a wrench to fit, I'd try a little thread lock on it."
4,A Fun Read,"A lighthearted book, great fun to read. The author has a gift for weaving a plot that is fun to follow and makes it difficult to put the book down."
2,don't buy,the answer key doesn't match up with the questions can't trust this book. I would try a different study book .
3,Good basic book on wireless internet,This is a good basic book on going wireless on the Internet. Maybe a bit dated but it's good to see history updating itself and go back and use a reference book like this to see how things change.
2,Hypnotic poison,The product was fine. The perfume did not come in a box. Why was there no box when the product was sold as new
1,Very late arrival,"The item arrived in very good condition; however, instead of promised 3-4 business days, the item arrived after one month which was very disappointing."
2,Most of the book are fillers,"Most of the contents of this books are fillers. It is obvious the publisher (Osborne) demanded the author to write a 500 page book in order to justify the exorbitant cost of this book.The real information on backup and recovery does not start until page 331!!!!! The author is a good writer and obviously had lot of IT experience. He does his best to make the book as informative as possible. But it is apparent that backup and recovery information is not worth 500 pages of text.I think the book could have been salvaged quite well if the last chapter on case studies of backup and recovery scenario was better written, but this is where the author REALLY bombed. His recovery steps can all be summarized as recovering the full, then incremental, then transaction logs. Anyone who knows ANYTHING about SQL recovery knows THAT."
1,Horrible cd,"My friend bought this and lent it to me, I was really annoyed with how every song sounded the same, I couldn't tell them apart! And another thing, who could understand what the heck the lead singer was saying? And what horrible lyrics, not every band that is ""goth"" or whatever has lyrics saying slit my wrists or cut my throat etc.What a good message to give to people, I know teenagers are smarter to understand not to cut themselves when they hear music like this, but when I was walking down the street and spotted a girl wearing a Murderdolls t-shirt and her arms were all cut up and carved with swears and upside down crosses, I thought: ""o brother, if she's doing that for attention obviously, well it's not working, If she loved suicide so much, she'd be dead""I couldn't listen to the cd, it wasn't the lyrics actually, it was just that bad"
5,Glam Rock 2003,"These guys are great, sounds like Pretty Boy Floyd or Faster Pussycat with violent guitars and one powerfull voice.Bloody, heavy, fast,it could be the future."
5,The Wait Is Over,"This Album is awesome. And For Years I Thought There Would Never Be Another Murderdolls Album. But Now, I've Got FOUR WORDS FOR YOU:WOMEN AND CHILDREN LAST!!!!!!!"
3,OK for the price...,"We have been using this sheet as our ""back-up"" for about a month now and I consider it serviceable for that purpose. I like that it fits snugly, but not too tightly and that it seems to be sewn well. What I don't like it is that it is thin (not a big deal) and the ""rectangle top part"" (it is three-piece construction, and I am not sure how to describe the part of the sheet that is on the top as opposed to on the sides) is smaller than the actual top of the crib mattress, so you see seam lines about 1/4 to 1/2 inch in from the edges. I have a standard mattress, so that shouldn't be the problem (Colgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress). Again, not a huge deal but it does look ugly with all those lines showing."
3,Decent crib sheet,"I got this crib sheet because it is the only one I can find in royal blue, which is the color I wanted. I've been pleased with how easy it is to put on while still staying snug, and the sheets are pleasantly soft. My only complaint is that my baby's spit-up leaves greasy looking spots that don't come out in the wash. I'm unsure if that's a reflection on the sheets themselves or if it's just a problem with spit-up, but since spit-up comes out of clothes, I'm assuming it's the sheet."
1,Colour not the same as stated,I ordered the turquoise colour and it is absolutely not the same as shown above. It's much lighter and slightly green rather than the rich blueish as seen here.
5,Charming and original,"I've read several other books by this author, and though she is a good writer, I was turned off by their setting (the early American colonies).But in this book she has put her story in London and Scotland in 1747, and I LOVED it. The hero and heroine are engaging and believable, and the kitten that brings them together is sure to engage every catlover's heart. The plot is very fresh and original too, bringing a new angle on the Scottish tragedy at Culloden, and the author did a beautiful job of bringing this long-ago world to life again.This was a very emotional, very romantic and original story that fans of historical romance won't want to miss."
3,Additional item description from separate listing,"""Remember peeking into an automat window at Horn & Hardart ? (as pictured on the front cover) Or watching a ballgame at Connie Mack Stadium ? (pictured on rear of carton). Or riding a gondola at Willow Grove Park? Revisit some of the Delaware Valley's favorite landmarks in THINGS THAT AREN'T THERE ANYMORE, a WHYY production. Narrated by longtime Philadelphia sports announcer Bill Campbell, THINGS THAT AREN'T THERE ANYMORE recalls such long-lost local sites as Horn and Harart automats, Bimbels and Lit Brothers Department Stores, Connie Mack Stadium, Atlantic City's Steel pier, record hops at Wagner's Ballroom, the ferry boats on the Delaware River and much more. This one-hour special uses interviews, home movies, news footage, rare photos, popular music and old jingles to awaken memories of the Delaware Valley's past. ""(description from separate Amazon listing for same product)"
4,Great book but Kindle edition is full of typos,"An excellent book - a very intelligent person describes two psychotic episodes. Unfortunately the kindle edition is riddled with typographical errors (literally hundreds of them). We're all used to the occasional odd hyphenation in kindle books or a mis-scanned word, but this was serious enough to detract from reading the book. Buy a used paperback instead."
4,A great book on collaging elements...,"Many inspirational pieces...Also, some technical info that proved helpful. I recommend this book to all types of artists. Find happiness creating in the new year."
3,A+ product with an F for shipping,"My brother asked for these binders for his birthday gift. They were very well-priced, so I ordered a dozen for him. The only issue I had is that the shipping was insanely high: shipping costs doubled the price. These are not heavy, just oversized, so I thought the shipping costs were out of line. Other than that, the product is great, the vendor shipped quickly, and the whole transaction was smooth and as expected."
2,Mediocre black metal,"This is about as raw as black metal gets. The good things about this CD is that this is also about as ""evil""-sounding as black metal (and therefore any other kind of music) gets, and it is rather unique in that regard. The downside, however, is that the music music is very monotonous and most of the songs aren't even worth listening to. It takes a little getting used to for those not already acquainted with this style of black metal, so don't buy this unless you're really looking to expand your existing black metal collection (in other words, you should already have one)."
3,"Evil, but needs more melody","This CD surely captures the ""evil"" aspect to music, but it is not as melodic as Dimmu Borgir, Emperor, Cradle of Filth, or any of those other bands. It also lacks the use of keyboards. Another dissapointment was that the lyrics weren't included. I've always like the lyrics to black metal songs because the satanic concepts are much more profound than by any wannabe like Anton LaVey. Dimmu Borgir actually has a message, Anton LaVey just wanted money. I'm sure that Dark Funeral has a message, too, but I can't understand what they're saying and the lyrics weren't included in the booklet. It is, however, very good ""background"" music... and I don't mean for martinis, either."
1,laughable,"to all heathens, satanists,Odinists, whatever, please stop with all this Kiss paint, inverted crosses and pentagrams. it is very childish. as Anton LaVey would say, ""The black metallers might as well be Christians"" he says this because even though they are ""evil"" their satanism is the Christian-defined satanism, which really makes it hard for people to take them seriously. But besides that, the music here is boring, redundant, and not ""evil"" in the least bit. Better luck next time."
5,Some Twists and Turns in the Desert,"Almost anything said about the plot of this movie would ruin the experience for anyone who hasn't already seen it, but anyone who likes a great ride at the fair will love it. I mean, right out of the shute, imagine Kris Kristofferson as one seriously bad S.O.B. and then imagine that he pulls it off beautifully. Riding the razor edge of almost but just not quite overplaying it, he winds up being perfect. The rest of the cast is made up of (aside from Matthew McConaughey, who actually made this movie just prior to his breakout) good character actors, people you've seen in any number of movies but who's names just won't come to your lips. But, to be honest, the scene seques are the real treat of this movie, which, again, to explain would ruin the effect of. All in all, a really satisfying film and, for the real videophile, a must see and, no doubt, must have movie."
1,fallen from grace,"the once mighty swedish death metal band DESULTORY have been kicked out of hell for making this album. Great demos and even their death-n-roll Into Eternity and Bitterness albums had solid, heavy and catchy METAL. Swallow the Snake is just an embarassment or a way to cash in to become more mainstream. When will real metal bands realize that isn't what metal is about?"
1,Author,"As much as I am interested in purchasing his book, I am so turned off by how unprofessional Mr. Randall is. While I was looking through the various books for window treatments on Amazon.com, I noted several times that he had commented on a customers' book review stating that their thoughts were a ""joke"", etc. I would think that a professional designer and author would have much better and more constructive things to be doing with his time."
1,Mediocre,"I honestly don't understand what other reviewers find appealing about this trite, forced, thoroughly pedestrian romantic comedy. I suppose it could be said that the concept of 3 possible love scenarios being played against one another is unique enough, but the execution is annoyingly mediocre. The writing is dull and predictable and the characters are like cardboard cutouts. I agree with the only other reviewer who was unimpressed with the film when he described it as a boring ""soap opera"" - it has an air of television melodrama that I found uninspiring and completely forgettable."
4,Byrd a believable Tracy,"Ralph Byrd and the supporting cast do a fine job of bringing Dick Tracy to the screen. There's plenty of action, of course, and the well-known ""stealth bomber"" plane that is indeed worth seeing. Lee van Atta does a fine job as the kid (equally good in Crash Corrigan's Undersea Kingdom serial too) helping Tracy, while the villains are smart and sinister. John Piccori, as a mad scientist assisting the ringleader hams it up splendidly, and Carleton Young, as Tracy's brother who is turned into a villain by the mad doctor, is wonderfully cold and unscrupulous. Personally, I like the Dick Tracy vs Crime, Inc. serial that came a little later better. It has a more intimate story with a more convoluted mystery as the suspects are eliminated one by one by the real killer. That is the only reason I rate this a 4 instead of a 5. I hope the other Tracy serials turn up on DVD soon."
1,Not widescreen?!?!?,"This is one of the greatest, classic movies of all time. As a movie I would rate if 5 stars. As a DVD production, I give it 1 star...until a widescreen version is available."
5,WIDE SCREEN-ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I remember seeing this film when it was released when I was a kid.I have always really enjoyed this film.I remember purchasing the wide screen/letter box version of the film on VHS in the 1990's.What TOOK SO LONG FOR THE WIDE SCREEN ON DVD?A family member & myself had been waiting and waiting & waiting for it.Universal should be shamed of themselves for keeping fans waiting for so long.BUT, I AM GLAD IT HAS FINALLY ARRIVED!!"
5,One of the all-time greats,"If you've seen it, then you know why. If you haven't, you will. That's all you need to know. Buy it today!"
5,Two Great Actors,I love the pairing of Robert Redford and Paul Newman. I enjoyed Butch Cassidy until the end when they end up dead in Bolivia. The beauty of this movie is they both walk away alive at the end.
3,Ain't what it's cracked up to be,"I was a bit disappointed at ""The Sting."" One hears often that it's a classic, but I found the story convoluted, the characters half-baked and the action...well, missing.Newmann and Redford both do well with their parts, but everyone else seems to be a tertiary adjunct to them. Even Robert Shaw as the villainous racketeer Doyle Lonnigan is not given much to do. In the end, I was left wondering, to use a cliche, what all the hype is about. And the surprise ending? I wasn't even sure what it was intended to be. Not a bad movie by any stretch, but not Newmann's or Shaw's finest."
5,Great movie!,This is one of my favorite movies ever. The plot and the acting is second to none. I'm a huge fan of both Robert Redford and Paul Newman.
5,Good Movie,It was a very good movie The Sting it was about two con men goin for there big con after one of their own dies. I would tell anyone i know to go see it.
1,useless,I am unable to view the CD. I have an HD tv and a computer that does not recognize the disk. Have tried the disk on several friends equipment with the same result. This CD was a waste of money.
5,One of the best all-time con game films ever,"Hooker (Redford) is a small-time confidence man working with his mentor and partner, Luther (Jones). By accident, they sting a runner for Irish crime boss Doyle Lonnegan (Shaw). Luther's killed just after he tells his protege he's getting out of the game and to head for the big-time with Henry Gondorff (Newman).The rest of the film is an elaborate and often hilarious confidence game on the part of Hooker and Gondorff to 'sting' Lonnegan in revenge for Luther's death. The soundtrack's ragtime from the incomparable Scott Joplin.Director George Roy Hill did an excellent job bringing this cast together and creating a masterfully acted and timed film. ""The Sting"" won 7 Academy Awards in 1973 and is still very much worth watching. We just recently bought the film on DVD so we could get rid of the VHS and it was very much worth the investment.Rebecca Kyle, August 2009"
1,How could they do this to such a great movie?,"This is not a review of the film ""The Sting"" by any means. This film is, in my opinion, one of the best ever, certainly one of the best of its time. I am disappointed in the dvd transfer...the video is okay, not great, but why a full-screen presentation? If they were going to present the film in full-screen, it should have been a choice along with widescreen, not forced upon the viewers. I bought this dvd because I love the movie so much, but now I can't stand the dvd. Hopefully they'll release a proper dvd for this film someday."
1,5 Star Movie on 1 Star DVD,One star for the DVD and five stars for the movie.C'mon Universal just release the 30th anniversary widescreen early already! (You ARE working on this right??)
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting more of a ""how to."" This DVD is not for you if you are looking at learning how to scratch, mix or DJ. This DVD is more a history of DJing. It does go into minor detail of what the DJs interviewed did to become popular. Although they don't teach you how to do juggle or battle, it was pretty cool to watch the DJs do their thing.The main (and only) thing I found useful on this dvd was this bit of advice: Get a feel for the crowd. If every body is dancing to a song of a certain speed, don't change the type of song being played (i.e. If everyone is dancing to a Lil Jon track, don't make the next song be Weezer - My Name is Jonas, it'll kill the mood). Keeping people happy is the main lesson to be learned. Now that I've told you that, you don't have to watch this DVD.Final note - my negative reaction to this DVD was mainly because I was expecting a tutorial on how to DJ, and I got a lesson in who influenced today's DJs."
4,unholy fun,"Missed this one on broadcast TV because it was opposite ""House"", so I was glad for a chance to catch it now. Sam's soul has been sold to the devil, so now he must spend each episode returning an escaped soul to Hell. The Devil is played by Laura Palmer's murderin' dad, and the actor really seems to be having a good time. The rest of the cast is fine. At first I was put off by ""Sock's"" blatant Jack Black imitation, but got used to it over time. This whole season was alot of fun. More humor than horror. There is some sex talk, but I let my 11 and 14 year olds watch it and they did not seem to be warped by the experience. The future of the series seems to be up in the air, so the last episode will leave you hanging."
2,Rip off metal,"Okay, first off, I'm not going to simply say ""This album sucks"" or ""This album rules"", because in some ways it is good but in others bad. For the good, it is heavy, headbangable, and Chris Barnes has developed a (somewhat) less monotone growl. However, if you listen, 90 percent of the riffs are near direct rip-offs of Obituary riffs, possibly due to Allen West being in the band. Even if the guitars were original, they are still boring, as most songs consist of 3 or 4 downtuned power chords, and are simple enough to learn after hearing the song 1 time. Also, there are few time changes, or other twists and turns to make the songs interesting; most songs simply have the same rythm and riffs for most of the song. When listening to it for the first time, I had to change each song after 2 minutes because it just got so damn boring. The only good songs are ""War is Coming"", and ""Revenge of the Zombie"""
1,Terrible attempt at death metal,"Oh man. Haunted was bad. This is just complete garbage. How can Barnes go from a great band like Cannibal Corpse to a band with such a complete lack of skill? There is no originality here, every song uses the same THREE power chords, which, oddly, are the exact same three chords used in almost every Obituary song. Now that I think about it, every song on this album and Haunted sounds like an Obituary song. The drumming is boring. Bass is non-existent. Same verse/chorus song structure in every song. No interesting time changes. No breakdowns or memorable solos. I can't understand why so many people think this band is so great. This is the Korn/Limp Bizkit fans death metal. If you want TRUE, original death metal, with members that can actually PLAY their instruments, check out Cannibal Corpse, Cryptopsy, Suffocation, Incantation, Morbid Angel, Angelcorpse, actually, check out ANY band other than this one."
4,The Essential Ginsberg,"This book of Ginsberg's poems are an essential for the Ginsberg reader.This has ""America"" and ""Howl"", 2 of Ginsberg's best poems. This little book of poems was also on a list of banned literature for the contemplation it makes one ponder."
4,straight from the sixties,A must read for those who have an interest in the sixties. Ginsberg is able to express much of what this time period was all about. The growing pains of a generation and the struggle for identity in poetic verse.RD McManes
3,A mixed bag.,"Ginsberg is perhaps an ""important"" poet, and I admit that ""Howl"" has a certain frothy energy. But aside from the oceanic rhetoric, there's not much in these poems; it's the kind of poetry that no doubt sounds great when recited before a crowd, but doesn't really bear much scrutiny. I was tired of hearing about the best minds of Allen Ginsberg's generation long before the bombastic, repetitive verses of the title poem came to a close. A few of the additional poems included, though, are decent enough, and manage to communicate a sense of the transcendent in the stuff of everyday life."
5,The Artist's Daughter,"Amazingly, this is the author's first book! Very well written, captivating in suspense and character development. Such a unique plot, that even as pieces of the puzzle are revealed, there is no way to fully guess the outcome. Included from start to finish is an overwhelming, yet unacknowledged, attraction that is very subdued between the two main characters, with no lusty sex, but becomes a major underlying thread that pulls the reader to turn page after page well into the night! A great read if you are looking for an escape or just a great beach book!"
2,"Speak English, please.","Fairly deadly. Text so tortured and pompous it interfered with the subject. I got seriously tired of it after a chapter and have not resumed reading it. Maybe some other time, but I am not hopeful."
1,Just as I expected nothing moe,"I knew when I even saw the first show of this that this album/band would suck beyond belief, and now listening to this lame pop crap I was proven right. AVOID. The guys vocals were passable on the show but they blow on this album But again what did you expect look who's in the band......"
1,How was this allowed to even happen?,"Note to all rock stars: Just because you might've been in a band with a big name, dosen't *neccissarily* mean that the new band you're in will be any good.And so with a band formed from a music reality competition show, Lukas Rossi, with The former four-stringer from Metallica and other famous rock stars like Dave Navarro and people washed out, this album poorly accoplishes it's goal. Instead of sounding like they were concentrating on quality, it sounds as if they were just trying to get the recording/producing part done and overwith so as if they didn't have to concentrate on it. and the worst part: Lukas Rossi, who dosen't even help by contributing some whiny emo on ""Headspin"", should have been replaced.Sorry, Supernova, but this just dosen't work for any of us."
1,Pure crap,"Quite possibly the worst rock album I've ever heard. It's amazing how age can effect someone's talent because everyone in this band has lost what little they had over the years. How can they listen to this and think it's good, I'd be ashamed to have my name associated with this garbage. Luckily no one will buy this and they'll fade back to nothing and never make another album because there's already enough of this low-level rock being made daily. Don't waste a second of time listening to this as you'll regret it, as I do, but curiosity got the best of me."
4,a wonderful read,"I enjoyed this book very much. To my surprise the hunchback was not the main focus of the story. There are various stories all woven together. Skip some of the very long tedious descriptions, particularly of the view of Paris from the top of the Notre Dame bell tower. Altogether a fabulous read and I could hardly put it down."
2,Dissappointed,"The story by Victor Hugo is a classic that has been presented on film a few times in one of which Quasimodo was played by the late great Charles Lawton. I therefor felt that I would appreciate reading the original by the author. My experience with other book/film connections has always left me preferring the greater content available in the book. Robinson Crusoe, Treasure Island, Gulivers Travels etc. The same cannot be said of this Victor Hugo classic. I managed to read three or four chapters before finally giving up on it. It runs into interminable descriptive dissertations about the city of Paris at the time of the story setting and Quasimodo is hardly mentioned."
4,Toppik Dark Brown review.,"This is an excellent product for people with thinning hair. It takes a while to learn how to apply it, and it can get messy sometimes, but the end results are great."
5,Great Product and Great Transaction,This is by far the best product I've used. You can't compare it to any other hair building fiber out there!
5,"Another satisfied customer,","I have used Toppik for several years now - just gone from darker to lighter as time goes by! Great product, easy to use and covers the thinning areas vry nicely."
4,Really like this,Product is easy to use and gives good coverage. This was a much better price than I had gotten locally.
2,Not really working,"Maybe it's me but, it just doesn't look like hair. More like powder on my head.Save your money and go elsewhere."
4,Good product.,This helps camouflage hair loss. I would recommend it for slight thinning of the hair. I've used it in past after illness caused thinning.
5,"My ""Wouldn't Be Without It"" Product","This product is a beauty ""life saver"" for those of us with thin hair. My hint is to be sure & use hair spray after applying it; that being said, it then stays in place...doesn't flake or run at all. The price from this vendor was awesome!"
1,Not for me,I didn't like this product at ALL. It clumped when I put it on. I will never buy it again.
5,great,The fibers look very realistic. I recommend this size. The color looks good with dark brown hair. Don't forget the fiber holding spray. It makes your head not itch.
5,Great product!,This product does what they say it does! My thinning areas are covered and my hair appears thicker! Love it!
1,"If you like the ""Spray Paint "" look, this is your product!","Got this From AMSG enterprises on amazon, and man, what a dissappointment.It looks like you have a coat of spray paint or dust on your head. I could see if you are thinning, and your scalp doesnt show, it may work, but if your scalp shows at all, this stuff does not work. Unlike the claim of being undetectable, can see this from 10+ feet away."
4,Toppik,"I look younger, all my friends and family say. That's good enough to say about this product. It makes you look and feel younger."
3,color cover up,"the value of the product for me was to color my bald scalp so it is less obvious. the powder is not hair, it offers color to the ""white"" area where you have no hair. it will get on your clothes and pillow case, but I found no permanent discoloration from it."
3,Not impressed; I don't get all the good reviews for this stuff......,"I was looking for some volume on my fine hair. This works no better than a dry spray shampoo, so if you want to save money and boost your hair volume a little, I suggest trying a dry spray shampoo (there are many brands). I suppose maybe this is a product more for people with very, very thin hair and maybe some bald spots? Maybe they would have better luck with this, not sure."
1,Not right,"I order these tools for my husband, but the tools had 2 of the mm tools in it, now i have to buy more tools to replace the extra tools I got, waste of money."
2,"Disappointing, Slow, Clumsy","South by Java Head features fundamentals I find so promising: a nautical adventure set in Southeast Asia during World War II, written by a prominent screenwriter. Nonetheless, the story falls flat and I found it just barely compelling enough to finish; the plot moves slowly, punctuated by one clumsily executed plot twist after another, the descriptions of action are confusing, and the characters mere outlines devoid of development. I hoped this book would be as good as a 1950's nautical adventure i highly recommend, The Wreck of the Mary Deare, but unfortunately Java Head is just disappointment. For other SE Asia World War II fiction, Clavell's King Rat is also a good place to start."
1,Disappointing,"The clothing and cars on view in much of the footage reveal that these scenes were shot in the 1960s (maybe even earlier). The impression is that this was cobbled together out of old travelogues and stock footage. While some of the information on art, culture, and history is still valid, this is not an up to date look at Italy, and it is not attractive or informative enough to view for either entertainment or education."
5,Wow! A Definite 5 Star Plus!,"Stryker's Bride kept me interested from the first page to the last! I will be keeping this and enjoying it again and again! It's fun, fun, fun! I look forward to reading more of Ms. Adams books."
2,"More recipe, not enough food science","I gave two stars because I was looking for a book filled with food science and basics that can be embellished. I found less than half of what I wanted. The recipes are good, but very simple and much of the book is just variations on these recipes. An example might be a salad with walnuts and gorgonzola...on the next page it might say, ""rather than using walnuts, try pecans and bleu cheese"" (I don't have the book in front of me so I can't give an example straight from the text; I've already given the book away). I was hoping for explanations of food science (e.g. it is difficult for meat to brown in an acidic environment) and techniques such as reducing and deglazing. I would have liked to see an explanation of the four different classifications of french sauces as well. In any event, the book is clearly written, but I would not recommend it to anyone who had any previous cooking knowledge/skill."
4,Amazing,"This cookbook is not about the recipes, it's about teaching you how to cook. She gives you a handful of templates, which you can then take in a million different directions. For instance, she gives about 30 different kinds of tomato sauce, but the important one is the template at the beginning. With that one in hand, you can create your own sauces with what you have in the kitchen."
3,"Decent, simple","Nothing incredibly earth shattering from this book, but hey, it's supposed to be full of simple recipes. Grab a copy of this if you're looking for some quickie weeknight meals that don't require you turning the kitchen into a disaster area to make the meals. Oh, and the best part of all, after you make the meal you really can wing it without the book the next time and hopefully get something to the table before you starve yourself."
5,Best cook book ever,This is the best cookbook ever. I never learned to cook at home and when I moved out and got married I did what I could with what I could figure out. I was however missing fundamentals and how to do anything without a recipie. I now have learned basics of cooking and how to vary them to enjoy endless possiblities. I also would spend so much time the the store buying things for each individual meal and never knowing what to do with what I had I had at home(or what stuff to have stocked on hand). I think everyone should read this cookbook.
1,this thing is a pos,"the cable is short and cheaply made.the stand is cheap and plastic...i thought they were gnna make it so the cable fits in the stand..stand its like 3 inches wide...and weak,,CANT SUPPORT THE WEIGHT of the @#$%ing psp! its worthless...dont buy it."
3,TU Y LAS NUBES,"Dear Sir:Pleased to hear you are asking for my comment re my recent purchase fromAmazon. Wish to let you know that one of your DVDs which is a double sided DVD had LOS CHARROS DE ORO and also TU Y LAS NUBES.LOS CAHRROS DE ORO had Miguel Aceves Mejia and Jorge Negrete, sorry to say Miguel Aceves Mejia does appear in this DVD, only Jorge Negrete. On the flipside of this same DVD is TU Y LAS NUBES, starring Miguel Aceves Mejia. It would have been alright if I did not include TU Y LAS NUBES in this purchase. What has happened now, I have got two (2) DVDs of TU Y LAS NUBES. Please check my list.Would you be able rectify this error? Kindly let me know.My comments re the reproduction of the film is more than satisfactory jugding from age of the film.Best regards,Jess de Sequera"
2,Disappointing,"I found this entire WWI series from Anne Perry to be very disappointing. The WWI setting was interesting but done much better in many other novels. The plot was somewhat incredible and the actions of characters at times outrageous. By the end of the books I felt I had wasted my time with repeated themes, one dimensional characters, and motives with no foundation. The potential for a meaningful work set during the Great War was completely lost and ended up being simply irritating and shallow."
5,Best for the money and combat sports,"This is my favorite supportive knee brace for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which requires a lot of contact between sparring partners. Because it is guaranteed to rub against the other person a lot, the rounded plastic hinges are really key for not having your training partner hate you. The metal squared hinges just don't work well for grappling and end up tearing through your gi anyway. This brace also stays in place better than most. This is the one I use when my knee is tweaked and it NEEDS support. The neoprene sleeves with no metal supports are good for keeping the knee heated up, but I find do nothing for allowing injuries to heal while still training."
5,Be a Participant in the Earth's Cycles,"The first edition of the Humanure Handbook was instrumental in helping Washington State Department of Health's Composting Toilet Task Force to develop and approve the State's new generic composting toilet guidelines that now allow the permitted use of toilets such as those described by the author. Furthermore, as an individual who has used a sawdust toilet a la Jenkins for 5 years among a community of other humanure composters, I can personally say that the Humanure Handbook is comprehensive, thorough, and moving. One aspect of the latest edition that is particularly useful is the inclusion of a more comprehensive list of suppliers and designers of home systems (Definitely check out designs for the SCAT: solar composting advanced toilet)."
3,"A good, informative book.","Jenkins book is very good from the standpoint of understanding what is possible. Whether or not you wish to be this up-front in the handling of human waste is another question. His most important contribution however, is his analytical approach to the composting process. He explodes some myths about mixing compost to make it work, and shows how to create good compost quickly. He readily admits that he repeats himself in the book. This is true. The essence of this 195 page book could have easily been done in 75 pages. A useful book, and one that will give you the courage to do your own composting, even if you don't compost human waste."
4,The two C.D.s are top notch . Not what I expected.,"Sea Shanties 1 & 2 Cat # PS 65150 and PS 65014, are rarely found in the local music stores, here in Baltimore. No one seems to know what a sea shanty is and Baltimore is a large and very old sea port! What surprised me right off is that all songs are sung in ENGLISH by Aussies from down under. The songs are sung excellently. You can understand all of the dialog....Good Show and all of that. Jim Carl-Oberstlt@bcpl.net"
2,Not that pleased,"I was looking for evening bedside music. This certainly was not what I anticipated it to be. It gets annoying, in my opiniion, really quickly. Wish I had not purcased it."
3,DeBussy musical biography on CD,"No this album does not give a proper biographical background of DeBussy, but it shows little slices of him throughout the album. It is a beautiful album to listen to. In an Art of Noise fashion it works as a concept album with reoccuring themes through melodies. Though I am bored with Drum and Bass, the D&B inspired songs are tolerable. Rakim also makes a cameo apearance. Don't expect to find the Trevor Horn ""noise"" Beat Box-esque material, it's a more mature AON. Plus there is a bonus CD with remixes. This album is worthy of a listen."
3,Audiophiles will like pushing the envelope of expression.,"I was suprised and disappointed. I couldn't believe the sound track on Greg Stump's newest ski movie by Art of Noise could be improved, but it was. Electric. The ""Narrator"" in this CD has GOT TO GO! The music stands on it's own. Re cut the CD and get rid of the voice. It's so distracting it's offensivie."
1,In heaven's name why?,"""The Seduction of Claude Debussy"" owes more to the work of Malcolm McLaren, in particular ""Fans"", than to anything the band did previously. I thought ""Opera House"" went out of fashion in the Eighties. ""Into Battle"", the band's debut, sounds less dated than ""The Seduction of Claude Debussy"" which should be clogging cutout bins in short-order. A soapbox aside to any Eighties band contemplating a comeback: leave rap out of the equation. It didn't work for Blondie, it doesn't work here, it can't work period."
5,Beautiful instrumental work,Art of Noise really turned me on with this album. The intense instrumental and choral work makes the tracks of SoCD full of a classical air and a modern sound. Brilliantly composed and brilliantly executed. A must-have.
5,Amazing!!!,"Since the day I purchased this album, I have continuously spoken highly of it to both friends and acquaintances. I'm still left speechless listening to the raw beauty of this work. It's a wonderfully warm and comforting womb-like refuge after a hard day's work or travel.This is not like *any* other Art of Noise album you've heard. I would best relate it to an incrediblly sophisticated hyrid of Andreas Vollendweider + William Orbit + Enigma + John Hurt(spoken word)! AON has managed to blend the smoothness of Claude Debussy's influences with modern electronica, snippets of opera, world music influences, r&b; tinges, hip hop, and much, much more into a kaliedoscopic soundtrack for the new millenium!Don't miss it!!!"
2,Canon EFS 18-135mm len,"This filter will not properly thread to my Canon EFS 18-135mm lens. In addition, I bought a B+W KSM Polarized Circular filter and threaded to this UV filter and then couldn't get them apart."
4,"good quality, but easy to catch dust","this product has very good quality. i didn't realize any improvement or reduction of the quality of my pictures when using it. but it really protect the lense well.only one thing that is not very good is: this filter is easy to catch dust, and so hard to clean. when i got this new filter, i realize there's a little dust on it, so i tried to clean it use camera cleaning cloth. however, i made it worse. i spent 15mins cleaning it, and there're more and more dust on it when the cleaning cloth touch the filter. maybe because this filter's material easy to catch dust."
4,Great product.,"Feels great, with quality build and finish.This should last for years to come. I can't find any fault with this unit, the only thing is that it's a bit pricier than other MRC UV filters."
5,great product. fast shipping.,great filter for my canon 70-200mm f4 L. bought a tiffen wide-angle uv by mistake and the cap never clicked on. now everything is perfect after replacing with this b+w.
4,Makes a difference,"I'm new to this so I bought a $10 filter and this one, no comparison. Better color, less glare, Beautiful skies, looks like in photography you get what you pay for, it's good to know. I am not sure I am qualified to give 5 stars as I know little about filters."
5,Very high quality,Much better construction than the Hoya (other than Pro 1) and Tiffen filters I've owned. Image quality seems identical with or without the filter.
5,Awesome filter,"Works well at keeping dirt and dust out while not effecting image quality. Clean glass, easy to wipe off without big streaks, and the threads were nice and tight. Perfect for my stock lens Canon T3i."
5,"Protects lens, causes no additional flaring or distortion","Comparison tested this lens filter for the same shots with a bare lens on a Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 lens. Did not appear to have any added flare, distortion, and did not lose contrast or saturation as compared to shooting without a filter. I've tried out Tiffen filters, and they are junk. Lots of flaring, contrast loss and more. I'd never put one on a lens.Bottom line: the filter glass is at least as good as my lens glass. I only allow a filter on my lens if the quality of the filter is high enough where it doesn't interfere with the optics of the lens. In this case, I've got a $50 filter on a $500 lens, and it works out.Minor scratches on lens glass don't tend to affect your picture much unless you use an ultra-wide lens. However, when you want to sell a lens in order to upgrade, your buyer may be skeptical of minor lens glass abrasions. This is where your filter comes in handy, IMO, and is the main reason I would use a filter."
4,Uv haze,"This tool is very handy, I like how it blocks the uv rays from the lens and takes thevpicture better."
2,New Package - old material!,"I am really sorry Mr. Levi but you can't mix your 2 previous albums and claim It's a brand new stuff.I guess I'll have to wait for your next album.I hope that you will understand that people do expect brand new songs, each time they buy one of your records."
3,Material is good - but very short,"This is a good starting place to have conversations with my boys about what God expects of them, but each chapter is so very short. The pictures are adorable. I just wish it had a little bit more meat to it. More of a ""gift"" type book to give to new parent."
1,"Poorly Written, Bad Information","Sooner or later, this fad will die out, mercifully. Dogs are not dolphins, to train them requires an understanding of who they are, not who we'd like them to be. I am a professional trainer and much of my practice is devoted to fixing problems caused by this book."
1,"Dopey, Misleading Book Relying on Discredited Theories","Although behaviorism has largely fallen out of favor because of the very limited picture it presents of the psyche, nonetheless people like Pryor persist with the idea that operant conditioning is the solution to all of our problems. This book has very few insights about dogs (indeed, her advice is sometimes dangerously misleading because she doesn't pay attention to the way dogs are hard-wired to behave). And the advice she gives about modifying human behavior are often unintentionally hilarious. (For instance, she recounts that in order to give herself incentive to get out of bed for an early class, she would feed herself small squares of chocolate.) There is much more to the mental life of dogs than this book would suggest. For a book that does them justice, try the Monks of New Skete."
5,Don't stop with your dog! Train people too.,"This easy to digest book will of course help you be a better dog handler, but the ideas will also help you communicate better with people. Train you kids to pick up after themselves. Train your boss. By the time you finish reading you can train your dog to use the 1-click ordering on Amazon.com"
5,The best all-around primer for positive training,"This is an easy-to-read, detailed translation of various rather sophisticated behavioral principles into everyday language. The examples are clear, fun, and easy to understand. The how-to suggestions are easy to try and provide some very clear strategies for improving the behavior of yourself, other people, and animals. I use it with the toddlers and it has helped me change the ""Terrible Two's"" into the ""Terrific Two's."" While the kids are screaming and resisting the requests of others, they smile and cooperate with me. The knowledge contained in this book can change your life -- for the better! I've read it many times and heartily recommend it."
5,A life changing book!,"An amazing, informative read, Karen Pryor's book gives the reader behavioral theory rather than step by step instruction, allowing the reader to come up with training solutions for themselves. This book has changed the way I interact with my family, my friends, business associates, and last but not least, my dog."
5,Best yet! Buy it!,"I have been a G. Love fan for years but sometimes the music can be a little hard to get into. The songs on Lemonade are perfectly crafted, every one! The run a range of styles and are very lyrical. They may be a bit more 'pop' than other offerings from G. Love but still showcase his roots and talents."
4,A Real Hoot,"This movie is just a blast. Its definately a bit chaotic at times, but ultimately it has so many memorable scenes, so much chemistry and so many sexual ineundos, it's just too much fun to care.Besides, its Humphry Bogart.The story overall isnt all that thrilling, and while I ve only seen it once as of now, there is so much other good stuff going on that it definately warrants a viewing. Its a classic like they should be. A clear nod to the times it was filmed in but with so many basics that we still look for in a good entertaining film these days, it still works just as well as I m sure it originally did it '46.The DVD is a great print too. Nice quality picture. Good sound, while a bit quiet on the dialogue at times and the bullets are LOUD!Definately worth checking out."
2,"the rock, the fifth element",sence sensibility good will hunting city of angel legend of the fall leaving las vegas singles little sister far and away the other sister
5,Truly a classic,"Watching this movie is paradoxically a breath of fresh air compared to most movies today. Outstanding performances by Bogart and Bacall (along with the rest of the cast), coupled with an intelligent, tense plot, and heavy atmosphere make The Big Sleep a great movie. The plot is intricate, and has been criticized by some people. While it can be hrd to follow, it is enjoyable. Unintelligent viewers need not apply. I've not yet seen this DVD; hopefully it's better than other classics on DVD (in terms of video/audio quality)."
5,Definative Phillip Marlowe,"Despite the newer DVD release from TCM---this is the best bet regarding the ""Big Sleep"" which includes both versions of the film. Actually, the 1945 pre-release version on this disc is the superior movie---at least the plot line is more coherent. The changes made in the 1946 release version were made to feature more of the chemistry between Bacall and Bogart--but at the cost of deleting several key scenes from the original which kept the plot line in tact. But in either one, Bogart was the definitive Phillip Marlowe--better than Dick Powell, Robert Montgomery or Robert Mitchum (who starred in the vastly inferior 1970's version).If you've read the original Raymond Chandler novel, you know that the plot line was complicated enough---as originally written."
1,Design Arrogance,"Very dissapointing book overall. Although creative, it doesn't do what is suppose to do -- communicate. It shows off the the designer's trendy style, but does no justice to all the winning participants. If my work were shown in this book in little distorted details, I would have asked for my money back."
1,And they call themselves designers?,"I've never had such a violent reaction to a book before. They call this a book yet it bears little resemblance to me. They show samples of great design by showing several photos all cropped differently. Not one showing the full page. Then there is the text, sometimes repeated 3 times on a page adding to the visual confusion the rest of the design creates.I couldn't get through the whole book, I returned my copy."
5,The coolest design book in my library...,"As a designer, I've come to rely on each year's annual as a benchmark for great design in America. But unlike previous years, 365 provides the insightful details that have previously been missing. For instance, was it the great illustration or the striking photograph that helped get a piece selected. 365 takes these things into consideration, rather than just showing a cover and one spread. I also like 365's index, which resembles the navigation of a website. The bottom line is this book is extraordinary."
4,"Well known by his generation, but not as anAmerican hero","Campy was one of my boyhood heroes. I was devestated when I heard of the crash that cut short a great career for this quiet man. As much as he was a star in baseball, he was more so as a human being. Still aqlive when he had no chance to live, he was an inspiration to so many. No longer possessing the great physical ability that carried him to baseball stardom, he rose to stardom as a role-model, something blatantly missing in many celebrities today.Join Campy in the struggles as a youth of mixed parantage, as a star in the Negro Leagues, a pioneer in organized baseball, but even more so as an unsung hero to manypersons with and without physical limitations"
3,Not all of season One,"Not bad for the price, but do not be convinced that this is the entire first season. The dvd only comes with one disc and only includes the first five episodes."
1,Should have been on a different network,I don't see why Nick ever put Invader Zim on. I mean it should have been on a network where Jhonen had more freedom to be his Morbid self XD like Adult Swim or something.
2,Not my cup of tea.,"I love the invader zim drawings. They crack me up, but watching an entire show, is not my cup of tea."
5,Zim is here! It's a good thing I exist!,"Zim is possibly the stupidest alien alive. But it doesn't matter as long as he has the cool gadgets, right? Zim is about as annoying on Earth as he was on his home planet, Irk. So, his leader sent him to a ""super secret planet"". In fact, it is so secret, it's not even shown on the map! Aided by his stupid SIR unit(robot), GIR, he travels to Earth and attempts to blend in, even though their disguises are horrible. But luckily, everyone on Earth is too stupid to notice. That is, besides Dib. This is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. It has it all, an idiot sidekick, crazy rival, and twisted story line. Think Billy and Mandy, but not as popular. Wah."
5,Must obey the taco man!,"Nickleodeon was insane to cancel this series. Now days if you can't make a killing in merchandise, they kill the series no matter how good it is. Finally someone came to their senses and made a DVD of this incredible show. The humor works on so many levels. For fans of JTHM, you see references to that series in Invader Zim. Praise the tallest, I am getting this DVD as soon as it is released."
3,"Somethings Old, Somethings New","Seven of the 10 tracks are re-recordings of her most famous hits from the 70's and 80's. There are three new tunes which are good tunes. The old songs sound fresher with some new arrangements. My favorite is ""The Sweetest Thing"", the last track. It shows that Juice's voice is still as powerful as ever. The CD is just a little too short - only ten 3-4 minute tracks! In the 90's, I'm used to getting a good 60 minutes of music on a disk. This one's a little too short."
4,Family Entertainment,"So far the kids are now spending less time watching TV and in Video Games. They share with family and friends.The game choice (Pool/Air Hockey) is a great alternative to boredom with one kind of game. It is easy to flip for them. It would be a great idea if they include a DVD (or booklet) with, different games, rules and tips on how to play or improve their skills. The package is very heavy and bulky and the delivery -unless specifically requested - is ""threshold."" This means you will need to recruit adult help to place the table where you want it. Once you have it in place it is easy to set up. You will need help again to set the table on the base. Leveling is key."
2,A faithful fan must admit a failure,"I have been a Local H fan since the release of As Good As Dead, when I was but 13 years old. Their first three albums are always in constant rotation in my collection. They produce the perfect music for me in almost any situation of my life. However, this album has none of the qualities of Local H that I enjoy. I purchased this album, and tried my best to listen to it as much as the other albums, but I find myself drawn back to the earlier work. If this is your first Local H album, I highly suggest you purchase HamFisted, As Good As Dead, or Pack up the Cats ... all of which have songs that make life worth living."
1,Broadway Prog,"I tried!I'm sorry, but the ""concept"" is juvenile at its best: Full of clichés and stereotypes.I couldn't stop thinking how much this album sounds like a cheesy Broadway musical."
5,Absolutely phenomenal!!!,"I truly don't know where to begin. 'Robbing Peter' was a phenomenal read. The way every character intertwined peaked my curiosity and interest to continue to turn the pages. My book club hosted Ms. Dupree and each one of us rated the book 5 bookmarks. If you read only one more book this year, 'Robbing Peter' is the one. You are sure to enjoy the way the author meshes everything together and details the lessons that each character experiences."
4,A pleasure to read...,"Not knowing what to expect, I started reading this book while on vacation. I figured, I'm vacationing in the mountains for 3 days...why not? To my surprise, I loved it. The author does an excellent job of connecting you with the characters. The story is well written and offers a refreshing alternative to the classic ""Baby Mama Drama"" story lines. I am very much looking forward to more works by Ms. DuPree."
5,Environmental Microbiology,"This is one of the most detailed, interesting, well illustrated books in microbiology that I have ever read. It gets right to the information that someone working in the environmental field needs, all in one place. No more digging around through multiple sources and hunting the internet for the latest information - its all here."
2,OMG,"I haven't bought this yet, but I'm planning to.. I just want to give it 2 stars because the PRICE, are you effing kidding me?.. I will update this to FIVE STARS... When it is.... at least,, less than 100 dollars... Until then... OMG is all I gotta say."
2,See this review for the movies by Wayne you ought to see.,"Basically a popcorn film and a waste of Wayne's talents. Starts out good but devolves into a trite plot of revenge to make one a man. It's been done to death. If you want to see 5 star Wayne, watch THE SEARCHERS, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, RED RIVER, THE SHOOTIST, and STAGECOACH. All are Wayne at his best and more Oscar worthy than his admittedly fine performance in TRUE GRIT. I am a fan of The Duke, who was vastly underrated as an actor, and made many fine films beside the ones I mentioned."
5,FAVORITE WAYNE,"I watched this movie when I was about 5 years old for the first time and loved it! I really wouldn't suggest that parents let their kids watch it at 5 though. Its a good movie, actually showing John Wayne's age and some lines that my dad still uses today, ""We're burning daylight"" along with my favorite responses, ""day light? The sun isn't even out!"""
1,horrible movie,"This movie is an incredible let down, I do not want to spoil it, but I do not know how any John Wayne fan can put up with anything besides the Duke himself in this movie."
4,One of his best!,I feel this was one of John's best; though I love all his movies. This was a gift purchase this time for our son.
3,Simple fun,"Simple fun, but not plastic. Some honesty about the prejudice of the time. Believable story line. Good family movie if the children are not too young."
5,The Cowboys DVD,This movie is a great movie that really speaks a lot about the changing times of that era--made in 1971. John Wayne stars--but it highlights so many other characters very well. I enjoyed it.
5,Surprise!!!!,I found this DVD at Wal-Mart. It was only $5.00. It starred John Wayne. I had never heard of it. I bought it. It's a DAMN GOOD movie!!!!!!!!!!
4,good flick,"Always enjoyed this movie, now I can watch it whenever. John Wayne and Roscoe Brown are excellent in their roles."
5,Kno Your Rhythms,"I have been drumming for a long time and have been called on to do all kinds of playing from polkas to avant garde. However, I wanted to be certain that I played each Latin rhythm basically correctly underneath my own stuff. ""Latin Ryhthms"" spells it all out. Thank you, ""Latin Rhythms""!"
4,2 player game,"THis game is hard and not a lot of people fell in love with this game , they thought it would be funny and not so lame , but it is not a 1 person game with skateborders trying to kill you and more i found it very hard. But me and my friend tryed it and we got pretty far , even though i gave it a 4 star i wouldn't recommend it to you."
3,Too much of a mixed bag,"I gave this CD only 3 stars because it contains tracks that, for me at least, are too variable in style. A little variety is fine, but I usually want to hear either ""authentic"" polynesian music or the more recent, quasi-Hawaiian style, depending on my mood. This CD starts out fine, in the quasi-Hawaiian mode, but then goes through a few tracks that sound like a night-club band (heavy on the piano and electric bass!), then switches to more authentic music, and ends with primitive sounds (music?) from Samoa and the Solomons. If you're looking for the broadest possible range of polynesian music, from primitive to contemporary, on a single CD, this would fit that need. But if you want a CD that fits a particular mood or conjures up images of paradise, you could do a lot better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FLAG!!!!!!!,"I bought this flag from ""The Fan Nut"" and it wasn't even the right flag it doesn't look like the pic so DON""T BUY IT if you are wanting it to look like this one! I contacted the seller and he said that the one he sent me was different because his supplier must have changed the design and didn't let them know so the one he sent me is all they have. The quality of the flag is very poor. It looks very CHEAP and very old. The one they send you is a bright red, white, and gold it looks like their old school colors. I'm all for throw backs but I don't like this one like I said before it looks Cheap! If it was up to me I wouldn't have gave them any stars but that wasn't even a option so that is why they got 1star. However they were good on sending it I recieved it fast just not the one I purchased. I would not recommend this product to anyone and if you do purchase it then you will see exactly what I'm talking about and wish that you didn't buy it so save your money!!!!"
3,Dry markers,"The markers that aren't dried out are great. However, 2-3 were bone dry and worthless. I had to throw them out."
4,"Great movie, so-so DVD","The digital transfer is good, but I was dissapointed how few ""extras"" were on the disk.The movie itself speaks for itself. One of my favorite comedies with Cary Grant in it. I love this movie."
5,! YOU GO BOY!,WHAT'S UP SAMMIE YOU ARE REALLY TALENTED.I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH I PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL IT IS HOT .ALL I HAVE TO SAY TO YOU IS THAT YOU ARE SO CUTE AND YOU GO BOY! I HOPE HE COMES TO CHARLOTTE BECAUSE WE ALL LOVE HIM
4,Kermit Smokes!!,"I've had the pleasure of seeing Kermit & the BBQ Swingers live more than once, & I think that this CD really does a good job of capturing their sound. Also, as a frequent visitor to NOLA, this disc evokes the whole feeling of the city every time I put it on. Do yourself a favor, and pick up a copy of this CD. Better yet, take a trip to New Orleans and check Kermit out live @ Vaughn's!!"
5,Must have for New Orleans music fans & modern jazz fans,Logan put me on to this guy- what a favor! This makes the list of the ten CD's that I will take into the bomb shelter when WWIII happens...
2,hefty but not so theft proof,"I purchased one of these for my enclosed quad trailer. While at the dunes, I absent mindedly locked my keys inside the trailer. Two hits with a standard sized claw hammer and the lock-clench mechanism broke and the lock fell to the sand. TWO claw hammer hits from a thief taking whats in my trailer.... thats about $25000 worth of UTV's and quads. If I still owned this lock, I would grab a claw hammer and re-prove to myself that I need something better."
5,great,great product and great service on changing size after purchase. highly recomend this coat. wears good and is warm in windy conditions.
2,Needs a Beefier Index,"Perhaps this book is meant for laughs or just for fun. If that's that case it might deserve a higher rating. For people like myself who are very challenged in spelling, punctuation, and grammar it just isn't helpful.I purchased this book in hopes that it would give me a fun way to learn writing mechanics. I expected illustrations to guide me through the stickier spots in my work. This book does not have that. The pictures are cute (in a vampirey, gothic way) but they do not add much to the explanations.The index is really not usefully at all to someone who is clueless in grammar. Terms such as Past Perfect Progressive Tense and Subjective Complements mean nothing to me. After reading these sections - they still mean nothing to me. It would have been nice to see index entries such as: Who's vs. Whose or Past vs. Passed. These are not listed. I took some time to try and find these sections in the handbook, but couldn't.If you are grammar challenged like I am, skip this book."
5,The Deluxe Transitive Vampire,"Absolutely wonderful, fun book. I used it recently to teach adults in my classes on Memoir. They needed help in understanding verbs and basic sentence structure--very helpful and a great teaching tool!"
2,Confusing,"Though the silly humor and snide asides are apparently intended to illustrate various grammar rules, for me they were just confusing. I found myself having to read sentences over and over, breaking out the jokes to find the rules. The book covers only the most basic principles of the English language -- another disappointment for someone who went to school to learn the basics, but might want more from a book like this. Even the clip-art was badly placed and only added to the general feeling that the book was tossed together quickly, cheaply, and without the focus necessary to be informative. Serious students of the language, keep going."
4,Half-Life Universe,"My GOD!!! this game is all you need to play, the gameplay is fantastic, the graphics awesome, the sound terrific, and the best: the continued relasing of hundreds of mods over the internet.The only complain is that doesn't include Condition Zero (2 disc) that's why I give it 4 stras to the overall, maybe Valve should make a DVD edition of this pack, yeah! the PLAT. COLL. 3rd EDITIONBut this game is best of the bests!!!"
5,"Very Good, 5 Games for the price of 1!!!","I don't know what the person is talking about who said Counterstrike is free...counter-strike was free...like 2-3 years ago...but it was bought out by seirra...I bought this, and i would most definitly recomend this.These games are all fun, addiciting, and just down right good.I love this pack, and i reccomend this to everyone who likes a good first person shooter.I also recommend buying this before buying Half-Life 2 (if you never played half life or Counter Strike before)very good great christmas present"
5,GREAT Belarusian author,"Please, note, original language is BELARUSIAN, not Russian.Vasil Bykau - belarusian patriot, who wrote his books in Belarusian language."
4,Video Production I,This is a good book according to our very experienced professor. I hope to learn a lot in this class.
3,A decent gasp of the then dying gangster cycle.,"Without much interaction between the two contrasting personalities inevitably thrown together at the stormswept hotel--Bogie's reluctant hero, and Robinson's menacing bully--this ultimately all seems a rather empty and synthetic gangster picture. And anyone who has seen the original, un-released version of ""The Big Sleep"" can see what the chemistry problem is between Bacall and Bogie here. But at least all actors pull their weight, and Huston's trademark style is evident. Not in the same league, though, with Huston's ""The Maltese Falcon,"" ""The Big Sleep,"" or ""The Killers."""
3,"1/2 good, 1/2 not","This book is put into lots and lots of short stories. I love many of the authors that contributed stories. Some of the stories were very good, such as:""The Secret of Life, According to Aunt Gladys"" by Bruce Coville""Waiting for Sebastian"" by Richard Peck""Passport"" by Laurie Halse AndersonThese were the ones I would have liked for them to be real books. But not an amazing book in a whole. If you're into the whole family traditions, family secrets thing, then I might recommend it. And also if you'd just read the good stories (above), then go for this book, but this one isn't a winner.~Atalanta"
5,Also remarkable,"Julia's book was very well written, entertaining and poignant. It reaches above and beyond infertility and into the general art of healing. She showed that getting well doesn't begin and end with western medicine. I was touched by her chapters on soul searching, which illustrates that when it comes to wellness, every part of our life counts."
1,Don't waste your time on this one....,"The author already has a healthy child. All she does in the book is whine and moan about how she needs another child. As a woman who cannot even give birth to one child, I found this insulting. I also couldn't believe that she spent all her time and money going to hocus-pocus quacks. Sorry, but eating strange fruits, drinking shots of wheatgrass and doing yoga doesn't necessarily give you a baby. This author is not a doctor, so I wouldn't feel comfortable following her advice. Ugh, what a waste of time this book was for me. That's four hours of my life that I'll never get back."
5,This book changed my life,"I cannot express how much of an effect this book had on my life. After two miscarriages, I was in a very dark, desperate place. Julia's story helped me realize that my health is NOT out of my control, and NOT just in the hands of doctors.It gave me the courage to change my diet, my lifestyle and my frame of mind before trying to conceive again. Instead of looking for problems, I now look for answers.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for ways to take control of their reproductive health in a natural way."
1,Helped me beat myself up more,"First, let me say that I'm glad that the author had a success story.But, let's face it. The reality is that not all of us will be so lucky. It is almost unfair to suggest that by doing all the things that she did, we can have a baby too. It's not that simple. My husband and I have been trying for **nine** years. No live births yet. I read the book and just started beating myself up for working full-time, for not doing yoga, for not taking herbs, not relaxing enough, whatever. I am sorry to say that regretted this purchase and am giving my copy away."
3,Nice robe,"I love the color, but I am less excited about the nap of the fabric flowing upward instead of down. This makes the material feel rough as you smooth it down with your hand. The workmanship is fine and the price is really good."
2,flimsy material,"I was excited when I saw this robe for sale. I've been looking for one similar to this for ages. The last robe I had like this was purchased quite a few years ago. Unfortunately is very worn. I ordered this new robe, thinking it was the same quality of my old robe. When it arrived, it was in a very small package, not what I was looking for. The material was very thin and not of a good quality. I live in San Francisco and need a warm robe daily. This robe looks nice, but it will not keep you warm."
4,very pretty,"Despite the wrong address this robe finally made its way to me-the company ""national"" did try to rectify the situation promptly(to no fault to National-amazon provided the wrong address). The robe is not warm or thick but does look very pretty on! I am petite and this fit very well-if you are larger you may have difficulty getting this on since the zipper does not extend the full length of the robe."
3,OK,"Robe was just OK. The material was much lighter weight than I had expected. Not the best in quality, but I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,National Long Velour Lounger,"Material was very flimsy & thin. It would definitely keep me warm on these cold nights we get here in the north. Also, check on return policy before ordering & returning."
1,Am I Crazy?,"With 264 Five Stars, I was expecting an incredible movie.I seriously don't know what people see in this movie.It was totally hokey and offensive, and the acting was horrible.It is beyond me why this movie is rated so highly.I guess I cannot trust the Amazon rating system."
2,"Mediocre western, typical Wayne fare!","Passable western, if you do not mind the racist portrayal of Native Americans, combined with the simplistic and turgid dialogue. A rather unbelievable film, I can think of many other westerns, new and old that fit the western bill better. I would recommend ""The Wild Bunch"", ""Unforgiven"",even Wayne's ""rio bravo"" are superior to this junk. Oh yes, an Italian named Sergio Leone made better westerns than mr. Ford and Mr. Wayne.Takes all the western stereotypes and mixes in bad acting, what a sorry stew!"
3,The Searchers,Did not order this movie. Ordered a different John Wayne - Rio Bravo. Kept it any way because the receiver loves John Wayne.
1,The Searchers,"poor color,skips..I will return movie. product arrived in a timely manner,fair price,etc ect ect ect ect ect.........................then screw it too much trouble garbage can is closer and i shall not reorder............."
5,majestic,"One of my favourite films.This is a magnificent movie from director John Ford which I've seen so many times yet I never get tired of.John Wayne is superb in possibly his finest role as Ethan Edwards.Wonderful cinematography,a stirring score and fine performances all round make this film a joy to watch."
2,John Ford--too many moral tags,"Best western!! I think not. Not in comparison to High Noon, Eastwood's The Unforgiven--the dialogue in Searchers is sophomoric, embarassing and Natalie Wood--that eye makeup is not Native American. Even the Magnificent Seven is better."
4,Great Product at a fair price.,These mirrors solved my trailer towing problem. I had experimented with the slide-on type towing mirrors but they scratched the paint on my factory mirror. I also tried the suction cup type mirrors but they were constantly falling off. The only thing that would make these mirrors perfect would be the enhanced mirrored glass on the passenger side mirror.
4,Nice Mirrors,The only complaint I have with the mirrors is they have a slight vibration when traveling down the road.
3,Ok,"I am always happy to add a book to my library. This one made me glaze over, I guess I would enjoy more illistrations/photos. None the less, it gave me info."
3,More needed for Novices,"I am jsut getting into learning about medicinal herbs and such and felt this book had much info but feel that pictures are REALLY helpful for identifying the plants. This book only had a few so just reading descriptions of the plants didn't make me feel comfortable enough to go out and try to find and use them on my own. If you're a beginner at the herbal thing find a book with pictures, this is pretty much just a big dictionary."
1,Thermally and chemically durable. But very bad mechanical design.,"iitala offers a porous but glassed ceramic. This material withstands all culinary oven types, and dishwashers. It is supposed to be durable.Well the material is quite durable.Unfortunately, the design of these plates makes the sides very vulnerable to hits.Mine got dented in a few days, during routine use.Too expensive for the poor mechanical resistance. Avoid this model."
4,Archetypal story of a wagon train heading west in the mid-1840s,"I rated Guthrie's The Big Sky five stars and gave this book four stars. One character, the mountain man Dick Summers, is carried over from the previous book. I don't wish to give away the story so will just say that the story was well-written, well developed and just about fully realistic. If ever a case could be made for reincarnation, then Guthrie would be the poster child. Hard to believe he could write these books without having experienced the people and places firsthand. That's high praise. Next up in the trilogy of Dick Summers is Fair Land, Fair Land. I will be reading that one shortly. As for the first two, they are highly recommended."
3,The Way West,"I thought the story mediocre at best. Why this won the Putlizer instead of The Big Sky is beyond me. Gutherie is a obviously a passionate writer about his beloved west but when it comes to telling an action story, he does not hold a candle to Harry Combs who wrote Brules or The Scout. I thoroughly enjoyed The Big Sky but found The Way West somewhat tedious. Towards the end, I was scaning instead of reading. Give me more action."
3,a pale echo,"Take some of the greatest, harmonically sophisticated pop music of the twentieth century, and add a handful of the best jazz/funk guitarists around,a nd what do you get?Well, not much, really. Becker and Fagen's carefully crafted songs had just enough guitar or sax solo in each to compliment the body of the song; they knew that it's the right mix of lyrics with a catchy melodic hook that really makes a great song.What we have hear is a band vamping on the changes along with solos that really aren't anything special, and in most cases fall far short of the brief and intense solos that accompnaied the originals. Certainly Steve Morse' attempt at ""Bodhisattiva"" doesn't come close to the intensity found in the Denny Dias original, and even where the same guitarist who played on the original track is playing, it's just not as interesting as the original.Tribute albums seldom live up to the originals, and the more distinctive the original, the harder it is to improve on it."
4,Lovely Mint Green Color,"I just received these lovely earrings for Christmas from my son, and I love them. These earrings have been on my Amazon Wish List for almost two years, but my kids always overlooked them in favor of DVDs or books. I was thrilled to finally receive them!Having only seen them on Amazon's website, I was very pleased to finally see these in real life. They are beautiful! The crystals are much lighter than the photo suggests...almost a mint green, but I love the color.I was a bit surprised that Silver Speck charged $5.95 S&H;, since these earrings barely weigh one ounce. Must've been very cheap to mail. That's my only complaint, I guess: the S&H; cost almost as much as the earrings!! In fact, I've removed one star from my rating for that very reason (i.e., S&H; way too high)."
5,Love it!,I bought this item for my husband. He loves it! He said the handles are long enough so he doesn't feel the heat from the grill and the spatula lets him easily get the burgers off the grill to flip.
4,calling this book illustrated is misleading,"it is not illustrated, it is more like an outline with a diagram every 5 pages or so but it is a good study tool, not totaly dissapointed."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY FOR BLU-RAY,"The 1-star is not for the movie as this is one of the best classics ever. The 1-star is for the blu-ray version. If you already own the regular DVD, do not waste your money replacing it with the blu-ray version. It is 16/9 compressed image, so essentially it looks like full screen format and I do not notice any significant improvement in the picture quality over that of my regular DVD version."
1,too much to wade through to get to the film,"This is a great movie! Leave it to Turner to fill 1/4 of the tape with stuff to fast forward through to get to the film. They treat a series of trailers like that's why I bought the tape.My advice: buy DVD that you can program to get you straight to the film. My advice to Turner (and the Star Wars folks, who also do the same thing): put the extra stuff at the end of the tape for those who want it. Most people want to see the film, not the hype or history."
2,Greatly Overhyped Film Noir,"I've seen this movie several times over the years and it has not gotten better with age. In fact, I really do not understand how it has acquired such iconic stature. The plot is serpentine but somehow not very involving, the acting is way overdone (except for Astor, who is just downright bad), the characters are without exception slimy or at least not very admirable, and the whole thing creaky. To its credit, it is not long and the direction is pretty taut but I certainly think that I have watched it for the last time."
4,Film Noir's beginnings,"This film was required viewing years ago when I took a class on film noir. It was excellent then and through the years, I reflect back on it, so much so, that I just had to buy my own copy. Humphrey Bogart makes such a great icon. He creates this image of man afraid of nothing, willing to bow to no one and paying homage only to his own rather unique set of moral code. He will not even bow to love -- the great power in American. His character MUST do what is right, even when all around him have failed to hold their own standards. He is a cinematic inspiration."
3,media impact review,"this book came in a timely fashion, in superb condition. Unfortunately I ordered it too hastily and it was a bit too outdated for my daughter's use in her current Mass Media class (my fault)."
4,good solid media book,"This is a good media textbook. Shirley Biagi does a nice job of updating this text regularly. Students will find it interesting and informative. Lots of photos and sidebars add to the information. Covers all the media as well as social isues, ethics, global conglomerates and more."
2,Wasn't what I was looking for,"I was trying to find an encyclopedia of interesting phrases like, ""Fell by the way side."" This book doesn't have most of that kind of phrases and includes unknown or rarely used stuff that did not interest me."
1,Garbage - Zero stars - Had to give it one star to post a review.,"Anybody who has been a fan since Kill 'em All or Ride the Lightning will be disgusted to hear what has happened to Metallica. What's next, a polka album? Maybe a country album? I betcha Lemmy thinks it sucks."
4,Intresting,"Metallica does it again, but this time with a symphony. I must admit that I was skeptical when I first bought this cd, thinking that Metallica would tone down their songs for this event, but I was very wrong. I can't imagine how the symphony could keep up with the band on such songs as ""Battery"" and ""Master of Puppets"", but they do plus they add another dimension to the songs. My personal favorites are ""One"" and ""Battery"". This cd is perfect for a long time fan of Metallica's or a new fan. Pick this one up along with the cd ""and justice for all""."
4,Musically Superior.,"I have long regarded Metallica as the most 'musical' rock band I have ever heard. This album proves this without a doubt. Anyone who doesn't like this album either doens't expand their musical horizons often, or is not listening carefully. It is an absolutley fantastic album! Every song is beautifully mixed with the top notch San Fransisco symphony orchestra. You would think that such a wierd combination wouldn't work, but it does more than just work! It flows with musical life like I have never heard. Almost every single one of these metallica songs are played better than ever before. This, my friends, is what music is all about. No question that this is the best live album out there. Please, buy this. You will enjoy it, unless you are one of the closed minded individuals who do not listen to music unless it is a certain type. This is a musical experience not to be missed! it gets a 97 percent! I would do anything to have been in that orchestra..."
2,"not really good, but you might like it","There are two major problems with this album:1.James vocals/singing have been shot to hell over the years. Do not judge his singing from ""Ride the Lightning"", ""Master of Puppets"", ""...And Justice For All"" based on this album. His voice was ok from those albums (but then it got much worse).2.Symphony music only goes well for I'd say half of the tracks; it sounds really out of place on the others.I recommend you listen before you buy, otherwise try getting those three albums I mentioned above :)"
1,HORRIBLE !!!!,"This album is without question, the most insulting and humiliating disgrace to Metallica ever known. I mean really... all the orchestra stuff extremely clashes with the greatest band in the world.. I mean Metallica is my favorite band,but I listened to this, and i couldnt believe it was finally over. I will NEVER listen to it again. During the complete process of listening, i was thinking like WOW HOW COOL it would ACTUALLY be if the horrible sound of that stuff in the background would like DISAPPEAR :-) !!! but if you want a cd with with some major clashing music this is perfect for you, and I seriously hope they're new one, St. Anger DOES NOT HAVE little extra background remixes, if ya know whati mean :-)If so,imean if this is in the future the new metallica, im divorcing them."
5,That Was a Balst!,"this is a perfect tribute to the greatest and most evergreen bands of all time.... throughout thier career, Metallica have made music that they love, not bothering about the current market likes and dislikes....... this is another example of just that. They have a happy knack doing something that's refreshing. This is pretty much he ultimate album for all Metallica faithfulls and a starting block for those who're not too much into heavy metal."
5,This is an album for everyone,"There has never been an album quite like this one before. Not many rock bands with solid titles behind them have stuck their necks out by playing with a symphony. Metallica plays with the symphony with style and flair. They do not sacrifice any of the hardness, metal, and beat of their other albums, but the symphony makes the songs flow, rather than simply thrashing it out. Neither is the symphony drowned out by all the electrical instruments. The songs sound as though they were written with the symphony in mind. This is Metallica's best album ever, it has the greatest music, the greatest songs, and the intensity that comes with a live record. If you want to buy just one Metallica CD, this is it."
5,Awsome...,"this cd is awsome...i'm both a fan of metallica as well as classical music, and to hear them together is spectacular...although some songs like battery, sandman, sad and one don't work well with the orchestra, it really adds another demension to classics like ktulu, puppetz, bleedin', nothin' and especially, for whom the bell tolls. there are two new songs, no leaf clover and minus human, and clover is probobly the cd's best. the only proboblem was the abscence of tracks like fade to black and the unforgiven to name a few. I would love for Metallica to make an S and M 2 after their next album.S and M 2Disc 11 the ecstasy of gold2 the unforgiven3 creeping death4 welcome home (sanitarium)5 where the wild things are6 disposable heroes7 don't tread on me8 ride the lightning9 the god that failed10 st. anger11 orionDisc 21 turn the page2 to live is to die3 harvester of sorrow4 am i evil?5 four horsemen6 leper messiah7 the unforgiven 28 ...and justice for all9 the unnamed feeling10 dyers' eve"
1,a sinking ship,this disc is another run of the mill from metallica who have lost there edge.they seem to be happy just getting over without taking any kind of chance's.lars&crew have had better days.strings can't hide lack of creativity.stick with justice for all and the lunch box.
5,smooth move,"i don't normally give a five star review. but nor do i normally come across a recording quite like this. metallica has opened a brilliant new alternative to their traditional albums. on s & m, experience metallica's legendary music accompanied by a haunting but beautiful San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. so enjoy this enchanting album. pick it up today."
1,Here they go again!,"These guys must be desperate for dollars. Ever since the ""Black"" album, these guys have really gone downhill. They used to be awesome, now I expect to hear their music in an elevator."
4,"May be a lot of noise, but it's all good noise, great cd","These guys can rock. Their guitars are awesome and they have awesome songwriting and beats, The parental advisory turned me off at first, but they're really not that bad. This may be one of the best rock cd's i've ever heard. I reccomend it if you like creed or any hard rock or rock, not if you like that new n'sync stuff. BUY IT!"
5,"SELL OUT, NOT!!!!!","First of all, let me say that i'm a big metallica fan ever since I listenend to this album. It is truyly a great album, but the fact is that a lot of people criticize Metallica for ""selling out."" Now , I can kinda see why people may see that in relation to Load or Re-load, but the fact is there not. There showing signs of a great band that likes to experiment, NOT SELL OUT!All the greats did it, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep purple, but some people just can't seem to handle the fact that Metallica is greater then Slayer or Exodus. Even Metallica's alter ego ,Megadeth, experimented with risk,"" (They're new album is great by the way.) Anyway, i'm rambling, let me just say buy this record, it's great and original and actualy takes chances unlike other metal bands."
1,It just doesn't work.,"I love Metallica and have since Kill 'em All. So I figured anything they put out would be worth listening to. Well, I was wrong. The concept of a Metal band and an Symphony Orchestra is an intriguing idea, but it just doesn't work here. Although I think it could work with Metallica, their song choices with the symphony could have been better. I mean, c'mon M of P or Battery with violins? WHO thought THAT was a good idea?Metallica's music, by it's very nature, has a lot of energy, but the Orchestra seems to steal this energy.That's my opinion, take it or leave it...."
1,"A must , if your intestines are seriously constipated","I bought this record because of a *feral* advice from a friend of mine, that now I realize needs badly some rest, some clean air and healthy food. This record is a miracle. At least, I deem a prodigiuos event to compress such a huge amount of tediousness on a so small plastic surface. A lot of wasted energy and a pompous monument to entropy in its most menacing and distressing notion. Buy it anyway, beacuse those poor boys needs badly both your money and a small sign of benevolence in order to be happy and keep on living. That doesn't mean that you have to play it and harass you and your friends. If yu wanna play some music on your hifi try with something else, let's say 'Pavement' or 'Eels' or 'Nine Inch Nails' or...."
2,What happens when you mix oil with water?,"Answer: You got this album.I have been into heavy metal for about 18 years. I have been into classical music for about 4 years. When you mix them you basically have ""The Thing That Should Not Be"".Metallica should have never mixed the classics from ""Ride the Lightning"", ""Masters of Puppets"", etc. with an orchestra. This creates an ugly mesh, where you hear the thunder of a guitar followed by the gentleness of a violin.They should have wrote the entire album based on new music, like ""No Leaf Clover"" (the reason for the two stars and not just one).I know that the Moody Blues were able to mix their hits with orchestra, but their music was more mellow and it blended well. Old Metallica songs border with what was called in the '80s thrash metal.What happens with this album is that with many of the songs the electric guitars overpower the orchestra. It sounds as if it is more of a competition, than a composition."
1,Latest is not the greatest. Save your money for a box set.,I'm a collector with most of Metallic's music and have been listening for years. This CD is not one I recommended for the general fan or even casual collector. This CD like many other musical experiments is on the fast track to the bargain bin. If you absolutely must have it be forewarned most of the songs are repeats and if you've ever heard someone spoof heavy metal by playing it classically (with violins and stuff) -- that's what this entire CD sounds like.
5,Sparking my interest,"I was never a big Metallica fan before these two discs came out. I bought ""Load"" whe it came out but never really got into their whole thing. ""No Leaf Clover"" is a truly excellent track. When I used to listen to rock more, I'm finding myself listening to hip-hop more. But this CD keeps rock fresh and alive."
5,S&M is simply the best!,Combining Metallica with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra was the greatest move in history. This album is a must for all Metallica fans. I enjoyed No Leaf Clover and my all time favorite Wherever I May Roam and Enter Sandman. Metallica will live forever.
5,One of Metallica's best albums ever!,"Metallica has done it again! Another great album to make any fan coming back for more in the months to come. Joining Metallica is the San Francisco orchestra that not only makes the sound unique, but the composing but Micheal Kamen is exceptional. This album is live from California and you will notice that the fans get into the music from beginning to end. By far, one of my favorites from Metallica. Great work!"
2,Don't waste your money ..,"... and don't waste your time.Metallica are lost. They don't have new ideas to offer and this is a MISTAKE. They should never get together with a Symphony Orchestra, it makes no sense.Hetfield has a big problem."
4,Well Done,"The shipping was handled very well and in the time they said it would be here, the product was also really great, the cd case was a little tough to open but all in all i was really happy with what i got."
4,some great some not so great,"The only reason i like this album is because of the blend of metallicas legendary 80's and Black album songs mixed with the orchestra. these blended well in my ears opinion to creative a suprisingly innovative sound. hero of the day even sounded good on this album with the mix, what i didn't like is the mix of Metallicas newer songs mixed with the orchastra, which of course i don't like anyways , like Devils dance and songs like that i could live without them for sure. IF you like innovation and like the older pre 1996 songs metallica mastered and made great mixed with the orchestra to form a unique but good sound then i would recommend this album. The Call to Ktulu (1984 ride the lightning) song sounds amazingly good with the ochestra."
1,What a terrible rip off and poorly executed to boot,This is a joke right? I mean not only do they try to take credit for doing some thing new(which is a complete lie) but they did it poorly. They have no idea how to make classical and metal combine. This band is a joke and James vocals are way too loud considering he cant sing at all anyway. If you want good classical/metal please go buy Therion or newer Rage. These bands know what they are doing.
1,AMAZING...,"Metallica has merits. They achieved an outstanding position in rock, one achieved by mega stars like Stones, Madonna and Michael Jackson. THat position is being capable of releasing garbage after garbage and still sell millions, thanks to their fans loyalty (or blindness, call it what you want.) Congratulations, Hetfield and Ulrich. Thanks God Newsted left this false metal band forever."
1,hYPED,I am very disappointed in this CD. It contains stuff which I personaly heard to too many times performed live. Same old and not very exciting stuff. The even had the nerve to put Devils Dance on it and the memory remains. Why did they even think of those? I really hate those tracks. Reload is the only album I don't have. The singing is not very strong either. James leaves the burden of singing to the audience. (geez!) The should have used tracks which are better suited for an orchestra. The band is playing their same old while the orchestra is constantly trying to show their presence which I don't feel is adding value to it all. Why did they even allow audience to the set? Which leads to the question why didn't tape it in the studio. I suspect the guys where a bit too lazy for that. If they did there wasn't a excuse left for producing a overbloated album.
3,"Good concept, bad effect","I'll admit that I couldn't wait to hear this album, I am one who looks for something different in music. Although the concept was good, the quality is bad. I would have liked to see this album around 1988/89 time frame when Metallica was still ""metal"". I think the effect that they were trying would have been much better. But with Metallica's slower tempo and lacking vocals it leaves alot to be desired."
4,Good,"It's good. Seven Brides for Seven Brothers is a great family movie. I'd recommend it to anyone, particularly if they like musical theater."
5,A Unique Combination of Casting and Choreography,"A dazzling performance by Jane Powell and Howard Keel, unique all round casting, and enjoyable music all add to an enjoyable glimpse back into another era of American life, as well the era of the MGM Musicales.I enjoyed the lyrics, the delivery, the dialog and the choreography. All in all delightful entertainment."
5,Quality VHS,Fast shipping. Good packaging. Very good quality VHS. Sound clear and crisp. Color good. No problems with tape while playing. Rewinds good. Very pleased with this purchase. Thanks!
5,Great Old Movie,Great movie for all ages. I showed it to my grandchildren and they really enjoyed it as much as I did.
5,A fabulous oldie but goodie.,"A movie delight full of music and wonderful choreography, I happily sing along and enjoy the fun of watching a family favorite."
5,I Didn't Know Countrymen and Women Could Dance Like That,I was amazed at the town barn-raising scene. The dancing was unbelieveable and the music is incredible. The casting was great. An excellent musical. Jane Powell does an outstanding job.
5,Seven Brides For Seven Brothers,Seven Brides for Seven Brothers for those of you that don't know is basically about six brother who decide they want to get married after the oldest brings home a wife. Oh ya it's a musical
5,seven brides,love love love this movie and so happy to have it in DVD. I love to watch this over and over.
5,A classic!,My all-time favorite movie! Loved it when I was 8 and still love it at 67. Even my granddaughters love it. Songs and dances are wonderful.
5,It was a very sentimental in a way movie.,I thought the movie was very sentimental and I enjoyed seeing it. The music was excellent and so were the actors and the actresses as well. 2 thumbs way up for Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
3,"Seven Brides, Seven Brothers","Good story, good cast with some fine gymnastics. My disapointment with this DVD, I did not remember reading it was not a full screen version. Also the sound was not consistent, too loud at times, then needed to turn up volume. The songs slow it down, I would enjoy better without the singing. I would recomend this but get the full screen version."
1,Raging sexism set to music,"The seven ""brides"" are actually seven women from the nearby vilage who are kidnapped from their homes and held against their will through the winter by the seven brothers. By the time the snow melts and their families are able to come rescue them they've all fallen in love with their kidnappers(!!!) and pretend to be pregnant so their parents will consent to them marrying the men who carried them off by force.When I first saw this as a kid I was shocked at just how screwed up this plot line is and the intervening years haven't made it any less terrible."
3,"Good quality glass, hate the slim mount","My photos through the filter are clean and sharp. I hate that their slim mount means no front threads to attach my Canon lens cap. They included a cheap plastic cap, but that always falls off so I don't trust it.By comparison, the slim mount Nikon circular polarizing filter I got does include front threads.I have these filters on a 17-40mm lens so I thought I needed the slim mount. But next time I wouldn't bother with that, or would check that it includes a front thread."
5,Everything cool,"I bought this on a whim for my husband. He loves Santanas music and I thought he might like to try his colonge as well.The ingredients seemed right on the money for his taste. He is in love! It smells hippy,classy,earthy yet still complex.Masculine but a little sweet. The color and bottle are cool. Will purchase again.Also 10% goes toward his childrens charity!"
2,"Too sweet, not masculine","Being a huge fan of Carlos Santana, I had to try the cologne. The fragrance is much too sweet and blossom like. This is not a light cologne, so the strong statement is not a good one for me. It has a nice hint of musk and if the sweet smell was backed way off, I think it would be very nice. Sorry Carlos, I wish I could support you on this one."
3,Old West Action Plus...,"Don't read this book....unless you're prepared to read the ton of otherbooks in the ""Smoke Jensen and Preacher"" series. This author writes a bookbefore breakfast and another just before dinner. They're plentiful andhighly addictive. Suspend belief and enjoy.Smoke Jensen, in particular, shoots or fist fights around a hundredhard cases per book and they all highly deserve the mayhem he delivers.In spite of this high fiction (most famous old West gunfighters onlykilled 3 or 4 men in their entire lives) you'll soldier on with theseries because Smoke Jensen is the stuff heros are made of and thewriting is crisp and moving.Just don't say you weren't warned when you find that you spent your wholesummer (or winter) in a comfy chair with 50 or so of these read booksstrewn around you."
2,BAP Has Become Old,"BAP is a German band singing in Kölsch which is the dialect spoken in Cologne (yes, where your eau de cologne was invented).'Aff Un Zo' might be better than its highly disappointing predecessor... but it remains clear that BAP's best times are past times.The album has nothing particular to show. OK, there is hearworthy uncomplicated rock'n'roll on 'Eddie's Radio Show' and 'Die Moritat Vun Jan Un Griet', and simple BAP pop on 'Souvenirs' - but originality is only heard on 'Mau Mau' with its cruchy guitar.The instrumentation of 'Istanbul' is really beautiful but lead singer and band boss Wolfgang Niedecken sounds old, and even though the album's title song is quite OK, it gives the impression of grandparent party. 'Noh Zahle Mohle' is directly bad.All in all there's little to recommend about 'Aff Un Zo', from some (irjenden) rock'n'roll band which surely has put its best days behind."
2,Accuracy?????,Bought 5 ovualtion tests. Tested on three days- used 3 of the tests. On the second day the control mark was present but nothing regarding the test window. Indicating marks did appear on days 1 & 3. Not sure how accurate these ovulation sticks are. We have been trying to conceive for 19 months- I have used several different brands.
5,Just was I needed,I owned this stock and made a penny or two from it. TEXTRON is a good company and it is not surprising that their tools are subsequently of fine caliber.
5,Great for a DIYer,Received the set with all pieces and have been using them often for the past several months. The tools are well made and it's one of the most complete wrench sets available in terms of the range of sizes. I've been using them primarily for car repairs and they've been holding out very well so far.
2,You get what you pay for...,"This product didn't come to me complete. I was missing a 5/16"" and a 15/16"" wrench from this set. I searched all in the packaging and throughout the box, and sure enough, these wrenches were missing. As far as practicality, they work, but don't be surprised if they swindle you out of a couple of wrenches"
5,Does the job,"As a Electrician and in the industrial field you get an idea of quality,for instance what to look for in a tool and taking this into account and how often i would use these spanners made the ideal choice ,Dont get me wrong if I were using theses spanners every day Im not sure how long they would last but im not and for the price top marks"
4,Pretty good wrench set,"This wrench set is pretty good, but not great. The price is right and they do work.A couple cons:-Almost all of the wrenches looked dirty and not brand new.-The 11 mm wrench had no marking whatsoever to tell me that it was 11 mm (every other wrench was engraved with the size).-The roll-up case smells and needs to air out for a couple days.Overall I am happy with the product. It is a good starter set and has a good variety of standard and metric sizes to do what I need to do."
3,decent,"For the price it's a decent set for basic use. I work as an electrician fixing industrial machinery, and i don't use them often, but they are there in case i do."
5,Absolutely essential for all theologians and seminarians,"In this continuation of Systematic Theology, Tillich reveals the deepest inner secrets of God, Christ and the Spirit. Very enlightening on the subject of The Spirit and the Trinity, and very important for those wishing to connect Christ with the preservation of consciousness. Tillich is brilliant in describing how the Trinity reaches out into the world to create and preserve all conscious life. Fantastic work - I cannot say enough positive things about Tillich. For an easier intro to Tillich, see such works as The Eternal Now, The New Being, and the Shaking of the Foundations. See also the works of Jurgen Moltmann."
5,"No taste, definite benefits","This stuff is great... you really can't tell it's in your drink. There's no change in color or consistency, and absolutely no taste.But the benefits are unquestionable... I'll spare you those details."
5,"All the fiber, none of the gas!","I've been using Fiber One cereal, and Fiber One bars in order to add fiber to my diet. Unfortunately, they gave me quite a lot of gas that was embarrassing. I decided to try the Benefiber powder in order to cut down on calories. Strangely, it works great and has none of the gas side effects of the cereals and bars!!"
1,Dead in a month,"I bought the 525 for Valentine. It worked out of the box, surfed the web with my internet connection but could not use the bluetooth to download songs from my laptop (the FTP service is not enabled, or maybe i didn't know how). Never tried the Infrared.The GPS worked fairly well. I am a new user, so low expectations. But the lady kept telling me to take a left well after the left had gone.None of which matters since the unit just died. It only works if it is plugged in to the wall. I am hoping the store takes a return since I really dont want to gamble $600 that it is just a bad battery."
2,Cliffhanger with no resolution,"This dvd is pretty funny. I didn't realize when I bought it that it would not be a self-contained story. It is separated into four episodes, and the fourth episode leaves you no closer to a conclusion than the first.I love the way the final episode on this dvd ends. The girl gets captured by a bad guy, and she screams. Next thing you know, they are showing you ads for other videos. Funniest damn thing.The stories are actually pretty interesting, though extremely silly and amateurish. John Wayne plays a guy named Tom Wayne. What a coincidence. He knocks people out by giving them a little hug.This is a really dumb dvd, but it may make you laugh."
2,Stretches Credulity,"This story is solid and dramatic enough but the characters felt shallow to me at times, and inconsistent at times .Sadly, I sped through almost half of the book."
5,Great read!,This is a page-turner from beginning to end. Good plot and pace populated with an interesting assortment of characters. Loved it.
3,A fun read,"Fast Track is a really good first novel. The author is clearly very comfortable with action, and the sections where the book is moving along the plot line are terrific. The book takes a little bit to get into, but once the story is developed, the pace is great. The plot builds to a really exciting conclusion that makes you want to read more about these characters."
4,Satisfied Owner,"This Samsung 860 Camcorder seemingly does everything that I expect it to do. Sure, I'd prefer a camera of this quality and ability without the tape....a completely digital camcorder. But I knew the Samsung was not that and thus, have not been disappointed. I like it a lot."
4,"Good ,Easy to use camcorder","Got a great 22x optical zoom.Its a good basic camcorder and easy to use. Tough I find using of digital special effect a bit difficult. It has a good battery life as long as you dont touch that zoom. Had good playback , comes with charger and AV cables."
4,I Want More,"So much of what we see on the classic TZ episodes has been redone to death these days. These are some of the ORIGINAL stories from a classic age of sci-fi suspense. This volumes includes three of the classic, iconic episodes. Kind of a hodge-podge mix of good stories on this disc. Probably the weakest in the collection, but still worth watching. Recommended."
1,AWFUL SOUND,"I am a fan of Lucias, and bought this CD as well.This CD has terrible sound. Its only worth 2.99. I saw this same CD at two swapmeet only going for $2.99!Don't buy this CD. The seller should specify the condition of the sound. Come on lets be honest to the buyers seller!!!Fans of lucia, DO NOT buy this CD!Sound is no good."
5,a great collection,"for fans who wish there were another Huck Finn or Tom Sawyer, you will find Mark Twain's 'joan of arc' just as beautifully written as his more famous 'prince an the pauper' and 'connecticut yankee'. for catholics, 'joan of arc' is even more of a must read, a stunning proof how this great saint has captured the hearts of so many, regardless of their skepticism or creed. Library of America editions are beautifully bound, lightweight, and readable. here they contain the two most famous of his non-mississippi writings with a gem most of us never knew existed. a keepsake for the decades."
5,Great soap!,"This is a fantastic lavender soap. I bought it as a gift, but kept one. It has bits of lavender in it that act as a light scrub and need to be rinsed off, but it smells fantastic and leaves skin feeling smooth and fresh. The bar lasts a long time."
5,Very helpful to me,"I bought this book because I wanted to enter the world of editing videos for my business. I found it very helpful. It compares several different editing software on the market, focusing on the simplest and most popular. I have since been able to edit several videos and feel I got adequate training to get started and also save money in the process. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a cursory overview of how to edit video and what software to get."
1,Waste of money,Sadly this purchase is a waste of money because the prograammes and equipment bear no relationship to what I already purchased prior to getting the book.
3,It really is for dummies.,"This book is good if you're an absolute beginner, but I was hoping for alot more info. It mainly teaches you how to use Windows moviemaker."
3,Susan's story,"Although I would have been interested in hearing more about her relationship with Ralph after the accident (their conversations, their ways of creating intimacy of a non-sexual way), I did appreciate Susan's honesty in telling HER story. There are obviously many paths to handling this kind of loss. I found her way to be beautiful and inspired. I wish her well now that Ralph has passed."
1,Absolute Junk!,"If you are a computer expert, enjoy constant crashes and unavailable servers and your child has patience beyond belief then this is the product for you. This product does not work! We spent a week trying to log on to the server which was down, then when we finally got on and registered the games and activites (which are no very good at all) take about 10 minutes to come up before you can play them. If you are hoping that you will be able to let your child play independently with this product, you better think again. You will be the one trying to navigate the instructions and reading the rules. Your child will be able to click every once in a while when you tell them to click on a certain item, but that is about it. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!"
5,satisfied,"Book was delivered quickly and in good condition, Got a great deal and more than i expected would definitely order again"
4,The nicest plastic bag with a straw I ever bought,"Yes, the CamelBak Omega HydroTanium Replacement Reservoir is a bit expensive if you consider it's just a plastic bag with a straw that you can drink from. But it has an excellent design and it won't let you down."
3,Not the same as pictured !,"The one pictured is not the one I received. The one I received has detachable tube. Hopefully it does NOT leak.UPDATE, No leaks so far !"
5,History that comes alive,"Too often history is written by people that were not there. This is a first hand account of what it was like to live in Soviet Russia under the horrendous government of Stalin. World War II is not just about the battles but about the horrible suffering of everyone. While this book writes about atrocities, it also gives hope by showing good people among the hatefull. I wish I knew what ultimately happened to Nina Markovna and her family."
3,A Guilty Pleasure-I LIke this Poorly Made Film,"This film, directed by Mike Post (Magnum Force) was Chuck Norris' second lead-starring role. It starts out as a movie of politcal intrigue put sputters on the direction. In the scene wear the plane blows up, one can see that right before the explosion, the plane is not even there. Just a small example of poor editing.I do, however, love this movie. The few fights scenes in this pitcure are fun (airport and parking lot) and it is one of Norris' better acting performance. The ""jumping into the car scene"" is actually Chuck's brother Arren. The other acting performances are also very good (Ann Archer, Lloyd Hayes, and Dana Andrews to name a few). The Chuck Norris fan may want to add this film to your collection."
2,A Early And Lesser Norris Effort,"Good Guys Wear Black was the first major film starring Chuck Norris, who came to fame as Bruce Lee's deadly opponent in Return of The Dragon. Norris began his starring career in a ripoff of the CB radio crzae called Breaker, Breaker.But Good Guys Wear Black is his first major effort, and while it's not the worst he's made, it's not the best. This tale of an ex- Special Ops commander whose Vietnam unit members are being killed off is okay in places, and laughably bad in others. The dialogue in some spots is bad enough to make you pause and rewind just to make sure you heard it correctly. The highlight of the movie is the great stunt where Norris jumps through a windshield to get at a would-be assassin, but that alone is not worth the effort to see this film."
3,WHOS NEXT????,"GOLDBERG WHAT CAN I SAY,2 MINUTE MATCHES...100-0 RECORD,HE WAS THE MAN.HIS STRENGTH ,ABILITY, WRESTLING SKILL SHOWS IT ALL.THELL NEVER BE ANOTHER GOLDBERG.THE FANS LIKED HIM.THE NWO HATED HIM.THAT WAS A GOOD RIVALRY..IT WAS GOOD TIMES BACK THEN.GET THIS BECAUSE GOLDBERG .WITH ALL MUSCLE SHOWING IS AWESOME."
1,CONSIDER THIS VIDEO SPEARED!!!!!!,WHY WOULD ANYBODY IN THERE RIGHT MIND BUY THIS....GOLDBERG HAS'NT EVEN BEEN WRESTLING FOR 2 YEARS...NOT MUCH TO SEE HERE YOU WCW HILLBILLIES!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Great product, not company",I have used this product for a few years now and I love the product but the company is what I have a problem with. Shipping took forever to get here and the shipping cost was outrageous. They were on clearance so I got 5 boxes and was charged $5 per box in shipping but when they got to my house all the condoms had been removed from their original packaging and place in one box and i was still charged $25 for shipping even though it cost the company less than $2. The S&H for this company rips you off!!!
1,Kindle version is 5 pages long; don't bother,"As much as it pains me to give a Wilde play one star, it had to be done. The version I downloaded (and I tried twice) is only 5 pages long, and ends immediately after the cast of characters."
3,Flat and Uninspired,"I purchased this one because I've been a big Leslie fan for years and the reviews were unanimous five stars. I hate to be the sole dissenter, but I found this CD pretty mediocre and uninspired. It sounds workman-like to me. That Leslie tone is there and there are hints of Duane Allman on the first cut, ZZ Top blues and Govt Mule at times on other cuts. Leslie's voice throughout is that sort of monotone huskiness with no variation. The guitar work is of course competent and has its moments, but there's nothing jaw-dropping here at all and little reason to go back to this CD for repeated listening. It's pretty generic blues and as there are so many technically proficient blues guitarists out there that can do this, I can only give it 3 stars."
3,Good Monitor...For the Price,"I bought this monitor to replace a small CRT model. Prior to this purchase, I bought an Optiquest for my computer at the office. That one was not a widescreen model. I bought this Acer because of its price, not because of the widescreen aspect.I don't like the Acer as well as the Optiquest. As others have pointed out, the colors seem washed out compared to the Optiquest, and there is a very annoying shimmer at the edges of all of the windows you open up.It's certainly an improvement over the CRT machine, but I really think you can do better with a different brand/model. I bought this machine online. Monitors may be something best checked out in person before one makes the decision whether to buy it or not.Mildly recommended, mainly based on price."
2,Good for a year,"I got this monitor at Walmart and it was fantastic for my needs.The monitor only lasted just over a year. That is unacceptable.About a week ago the monitor would not wake up. It powered on but would not come on.Several cable and monitor swaps later I narrowed it down to a bad monitor.I replaced it recently with a 23"" HP monitor for about the same price."
1,Missing Items,I ordered this last week and upon arrival was very annoyed to learn that it does NOT come with instruction manuals. As well as this the box contained only four of the promised five games (cleopatra was missing). If anyone has any idea what I can do to get a refund etc. please post a replythank you(don't buy this unless you have access to the manuals!)
3,Nipples Different,"One set is the ones I use and the next are totally different. The ones I don't like are Birth-12 months ones, My 2 y/o has a hard time sucking. The ones i use are the all stage, Like I thought I was purchasing. I didn't return them too much of a hassle."
5,The indiscribability of Afrika,Two thousand seasons does what few prior to it or after it can do. It exposes the magical intricacies and the aura's that exsit and exsited amongst first worlds people. Few do it as wonderfully as Ayi Kwei Armah. I was moved emotionally.
5,Excellent! This book is a must,I found this book to be truly entertaining and a must read for all people of African descent. This is definitely a novel that should rank among the ten best in African literature.
3,Below Another Sky,"The book Below Another Sky by Rick Ridgeway is a book about a man (Rick) and his friends going to various countries and climbing various mountains. Rick is a man who loves to climb and his best friend, Jonathan is a photographer going on a trip to this mountain to get pictures of the mountain. Later, Jonathans dauter, Asia, and Rick set out on their own trip to other mountains. I thought that this book was okay, but it wasn't all that great. I didn't like why he did not mention why he and Asia set off on their journey because that set me off track a little, although, I like hiking and climbing mountainous areas, so it was kind of interesting for me. I would especially recomend this book to people who like adventuresome books and movies."
4,As advertised,"If I recall, other reviews noted that this item is a little on the flimsy side, but it does the job fine for me. I have it mounted at the top of my stairs to keep my dog from going down. My dog is extremely well-behaved, so any barrier will do, as he is not the type to push through. With persistence, a more aggressive pet or child might be able to get past this.I like the mounting brackets for the gate, as it actually allows for the gate to swing open and closed like a regular door, but plan to use your own fasteners to install the brackets. The gate also collapses, accordion style, but it's just a tad stiff, which will probably ease up with use.Another review noted the latch on the gate is a little difficult to open and close and it isn't the best, but for the price this gate is still a good value."
3,100 Flowers book,"I was a little dissapointed with this book. It was a lot smaller in size than I was expecting, and the illustrations are just black and white outlines, not color photos of each flower like I was expecting. They should call it ""How 100 flowers got their names"" instead."
2,too big,I had to return this product right away. It was way bigger than what I expected. It takes a lot of space on the counter.
3,Most of the songs are okay...,"I bought this CD after listning to the latest in the series, ""Cable Ready."" I found that some of the songs, such as ""The Patty Duke Show"" were not remastered as well as they should have been. It has a shrill, sometimes static-type noise. Otherwise, it was a perfectly good album."
5,Excellent collection!,This is one of the best collections of Television Movie themes that I have listened to. You can't find most of these songs anywhere else. Excellent buy!
3,EHHH! Ok.,The scissors are ok. Look as pictured. They were recommended by an occupational therapist for our son to help fine motor skills. They help get the motion of squeezing the scissors down without getting caught up in the handles that have holes. They work well for right of lefties. Overall no real complaints just not spectacular.
3,Good Buy,I would have given it a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the crack in the case. But the music itself is great.
4,Exactly what I expected.,The product arrived earlier than expected and in good condition. The product was as advetised and enjoyed by all. I am an Activity Director at a Long Term Care Facility with residents ranging in age from 28-98. The CD had something for everyone. Very pleased.
1,THIS WILL RUIN YOUR FURNITURE!!!!!,If I could I would give this product no stars. I put this on my coffee table and tv stand to protect my child from the corners. As it says in the manual you can easily take it off and just wipe the leftovers with a wet cloth...That is not true at all. I tried to take them off my coffee table and it took off half of my table. same happened on the tv stand. This is the worse stuff ever. DO NOT BUY THIS! IT WILL RUIN YOUR FURNITURE!!!!!
1,More work than it is worth.,I liked the edge guard at first. After awhile it started to move and crumbs from my son started to accumalte. It would move and all sorts of stuff would stick to the edge. After a couple months i couldn't stand it and took it off. That is when all my grief began. It was next to impossible to get the adhesive off my table. They told me it would rub right off. I tried to use every method in the book. After a lot of elbow grease and Lots of goo gone i finally got it off. I do not recommend buying this product. It is more work than it is worth.
2,Would work if the bumpers stayed on,Not worth the hassle of cutting up the pieces to fit your table and sticking it on....eventually falls right off anyway which doesn't do any good when it comes to a curious and active child.
2,Good in theory,"I guess these served their purpose for protecting the edges of our glass coffee table from our toddler. However, I just spent the last hour trying to take this off. I had to use goo-gone and a razor. Would have ruined my table if it was made of wood. Will not buy again."
2,A Waste of Money,"We purchased this item, thinking it would be great for our large wooden coffee table. Our son just started walking & we wanted to protect him. It took a long time to cut the cushion to fit the table. Then, the adhesive that comes with the product is horrible. Eventually, our son was able to get the strips of cushion off that had not fallen off on their own. We are now seeking a new product (as well as a new coffee table since the wood finish was stripped off)."
4,Soft and protective,So far I love this product - very soft and cushiony and wraps smartly around corners. I haven't had problems with my baby trying to detach it yet.
3,Too short,"I ordered 2 packages in order to cover the appropriate circumference of 1 coffee table and the front edges of two end tables. When the package arrived the length of edging was 7'6"", not 12' as advertised. That means I was completely short and could not complete my project. Aside from the lack of length, the product works well and seems secure. I would have ordered more had I known about the length. It's quite a disparity between 7' and 12', so purchase appropriately."
2,Not too thrilled. . .,I was pretty happy with this product at first. My son suffered stitches a few weeks ago after a run-in with our coffee table so I thought we'd try this. Only problem is he wants to rip it off & it comes off sooooo easily. The tape that is provided doesn't take much to un-stick it. I am pretty unhappy with this purchase as a result.
4,Good Book But Heavy On Book And Journal Making; All Work Very Time Consuming,"If you want some inspiration for art work you can do in a reasonable period of time, I doubt this is for you. Collage, journals, art books and altered imagery can be some of the most time consuming projects in the art world and the ones in this book are no exception. Frankly, I want to produce my art images and projects faster than this. Also, the imagery in this book has a tendency to all look the same. Look at the cover. You are looking at the stylistic range. All this said, I do not think this is a bad book at all. It is a very good book for the right person. If you have your heart set on making your own art book or art journal using altered images, including photo transfers, and you have the time to make a very detail oriented, full project, then this book will probably guide you the whole way. Also, if your personal style is more in the folk art way, all to the good."
3,"The show was great, the game...ok","I like the game. It is somewhat challenging, and I like that. The only real problem I have with the game is the fact that you I have the freedom that I have in other similar games. You have to choose a chasis (you cannot design one), and everything goes into predetermined places. What I mean is, although there are a wide variety of weapons, you can only place them in one of two places.But it is a challenging game, and a fun one to play. Even with the almost pre-fab feel, I do enjoy playing it. I only regret that I cannot build a replica of my bots from the other game. I would love to attempt to rip the plating off of the house bots with it."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I couldn't be more disappointed in this product. I knew the description said ""out of box""...which would have been fine. What I received was a dried up, used tube of mascara clearly labeled ""TESTER"". What? Is that even legal to sell? I WILL NOT be using this product-really don't wish to get a raging case of conjuctuvitis. I have always been happy with my Amazon purchases but this is beyond ridiculous."
1,"Pathetically Biased, Useless Disinformation","Guess what people? The U.S. is not a democracy and was never intended to be one. This book presumes that the second tenet of communism, democracy, is supposed to be inherent in the American political system. The U.S. utilizes a constitutional republic form of government -- with some democratic processes -- for many reasons, but Dahl ignores and defames the cornerstone beliefs of the Founding Fathers simply because of his socialist agenda.Don't pay a dime... You can get almost as much information from the evening news. You know what I mean ; )"
3,"Thought provoking, but certainly biased.","This book was fascinating, but written from what I perceived to be a left wing bias. (Which is fine, freedom of thought is a cherished American belief.)Professor Dahl makes several good points. Personally, I think the Electoral College is long overdue for abolition, and I'm not hostile to the idea of abolishing the Senate and establishing a unicameral legislature. However, I'm not convinced the US should adopt proportional representation. (Although perhaps the first-past-the-post system could be modified. For example, a run off election if no candidate garners more than 50% of the vote.) Professor Dahl has little use for our Presidential system, but doesn't adequately explain to me why we should have both a President and Prime Minister. I liked this book. It is what it was intended to be....thought provoking. However I tend to disagree with some of his prescriptions."
3,Sticky tape,Works but has trouble sticking to the edge of a 1/2 in thick glass table. Needs extra sticky tape for glass.
4,How far will you go to protect a friend?,"When Aaron reacts with violence to his father's domestic abuse, his friends are faced with the question ""How far will you go to protect a friend"". The boys make their decisions but through ill-chance and bad-decisions events quickly spiral out of control and no-ones life is going to be as it was.Overall this film was watchable and the plot moved along well. The script is adequate but in no way great. All of the main characters were believable and you could easily empathize with the boys, however it suffered in that none of the characters was fully developed and the ending was, at best, ambiguous. I found the situation compelling but I had the feeling throughout that this could have been MUCH better with a stronger script."
4,Creepy and compelling...but won't give you nightmares!,"Creepy and compelling. This is a story about two sisters, their uncle, the mysterious deaths of the rest of their family, and a cousin who suddenly comes to visit.The younger sister `Merricat' is the narrator. Her voice is unusual and at times disturbing, which adds to the creepy, dramatic tone of the story. The reader gradually learns the story of their past.If you like gothic, mysterious, old fashioned books, I highly recommend this."
1,Why is this called horror?,"I was all excited about reading this famous ""horror"" book, with its weird sisters and witchcraft. Boy, was I disappointed! The plot of the family being poisoned, and the surviving family living alone in the big house had great potential, but too much time was spent inside Merricat's crazy head, instead of explaining all the other characters and the story. What we have in this book is a tale of a young woman with obsessive-compulsive disorder (and who knows what other mental illnesses) and her sister-who seems to have co-dependency problems. The only thing scary about this book is that so many people ""identify"" with the characters."
1,Awful!,The description of this book was better than the actual book by far. The only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping that it would get better. It never did.
5,Can I rate it any higher?,"This bone-chilling story revolves around a teenage girl, Mary-Kat, and her family; the town outcasts. They are outcasts for good reason, though. Mary-Kat is demonic, evil, and maybe a little bit crazy, as are her living family members. Murder, poison, spiteful cat-calling all add to the character of this book. But also, much goes unsaid, which is why many people fail to understand its true meaning. Enjoy, because it doesn't get any better than this."
4,"A bit gothic, very sad...","Shirley jackson, famous for ""The Haunting of Hill House"" delivers another winner, albeit a more restrained one. This time, no haunted house, no paranormal activities. Just small town pettiness and a creeping sense of paranoia. Well written, eloquent, this would make a fascinating on-secreen psychological drama. The book is not dated at all, but on the contrary acts as a still relevant and poignant indicment of intolerance and meanness. What emerges in the end is the utter alienation of the main protagonists. There is a pervading sense of loneliness in Miss Jackson's writing that is absolutely compelling. I won't reveal the ending, but rest assured: this book is a wonderful addition to any booklover library. This Penguin edition cover is also nicely designed and features a very enlightening foreword penned by Jonathan Lethem, author of ""The Fortress of Solitude"". A true gem!"
2,Not Clear and Not Early,"I tested on days 24, 28 and 31 of my cycle, and the results were negative. By this time I was already experiencing uncontrollable bouts of hunger and fatigue. On day 32 I bought a High Street brand and within a couple seconds a faint positive line appeared and within a couple minutes the line was distinct! For the purpose of this review I tried these tests again... After a good five minutes with only a negative line showing, a barely discernable positive line appeared. Probably the test I had tried on day 31 beared the same results, but I didn't wait long enough - or look hard enough. Conclusion: If you're looking for a clear, simple and speedy result - go with a High Street brand."
1,Pay-Per-View News,"Fox is great! However, I can see the new trend: Pay for your ""cable news"" TWICE! $2 for local daily $8 for national daily, andjust $19.99 for documentary style news programs...YIKES!"
3,Not your standard David Morrell,"I'm such a David Morrell fan that I was eager to read another of his masterpieces. This wasn't it. Last Reveille is more of an historical musing - a departure from his usual action/adventure novels, but still interesting to someone like me, who never read much about this time period."
3,OK,"I remember watching this as a kid and really liking it, but as an adult I think it has lost some of its appeal. I do still like to watch it and reminisce, but it isn't quite the same feeling."
2,When will we get to see a classic Muppet special UNEDITED?!?!?!,"I have fond memories of this special, and when I saw the DVD release I had to get a copy. The first thing I noticed with dissapointment was the missing opening with Kermit.On instinct I searched for the final chapter and alas, Kermits gone there too and the closing song as well.As far as the story goes, it appears untouched, but its a realy big let down to see yet another special edited for no apparent reason. Something just seems to be missing for me from this special, and thankfully I still have my VHS copy."
3,In-depth on theory,"If you're already at a high level, this is the book for you. I found it a little deep for someone relatively new to the subject."
4,Edge Guards,"Served the purpose they were purchased for. Stone hearth on fireplace was posing danger to out new walker. Look good, great adhesive, but they don't cut easily to length."
1,Two-Sided Tape Table Bumper,We found this product to be ineffective as our baby would pretty easily pull the rubber bumpers right off our coffee table over and over again even though we used as much of the two-sided tape as we could.
3,Yechh!!,"This is one of the few films where I keenly felt the director's contempt for the audience. It's as if Fancher was saying, ""Everything about this film, about sitting in your seat watching it, about your existence - I throw scum and defilement on."" There's no secret thrill to be had here, although I was convinced by the grittiness, the oppressive atmosphere, and the gloom that permeated everything and everyone. Not a very easy film to watch, especially if you like thought-provoking work. ""Seven"" doesn't reach beyond a visceral level, as clever as it is by the end."
1,Repellant violence and shoddy scriptwriting,"I am amazed at the cast of fine actors who were willing to be involved in this gratuitous gore-fest. The scenes between Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are meandering, meaningless filler as the director waits, slavering, to spring another disgusting image on the viewer.What truly disturbs me is the positive response this primer for murder and degradation elicited from the public. Now, that's scary."
1,avoid this version - GET THE 2 DVD SPECIAL EDITION,"SE7EN is one of the greatest movies ever made. The fact that this single disc edition is still available is ""ridiculous to the point of being offensive."" Get the 2 DVD version. That one looks amazing, has great commentary, and contains a bunch of cool special features."
1,"Great movie, BAD DVD","I loved this movie! The amazing cast delivered an eerily awesome performance. However, the people at New Line Home Vieo decided that they wanted to put half the movie on each side of the DVD, even though the movie is only about 2 hours long. The result is, halfway through the movie, you have to flip the DVD over. I thought they invented DVDs so that it was unnecessary to flip them like laserdiscs. Ahh, well. Good movie. If the flipping doesn't bug you, buy it!"
4,Something's missing....,"As a film overall, Seven has all the key elements -- great acting (Freeman,Spacey and Pitt are all excellent), super photography, a creepy and compelling plot, and just enough gory visuals to keep it interesting. But it does have its flaws. First off, Tracy is a little strange from the git-go. ""Nough said without giving away anything. Second, while I totally understood the ending (yes, every aspect of it), it just wasn't fulfilling. Not in any way. The viewer feels cheated, not completed. This is a major problem with Seven and what holds it back from being a Silence-type classic. There's such a thing as being too artistic."
1,Release from Alliance Canada has the wrong Aspect Ratio,"The original AR for Seven is 2.35:1, this release is 1.85:1Not recommended, wait for a US release."
2,a lot of rain and bad acting,all the tortures inflicted by the serial killer in this film pale next to having to watch brad pitt's horrible acting. and brad pitt's acting is better than the script.
2,"Ambitious, but falls short","Others have already summarized the film, so I'll just make the comment that Se7evn's seemingly brilliant plot completely falls apart at the end. The screenwriter apparently got muddled towards the grand finale and just did whatever sorta worked. Also, if you're even moderately squeamish, you won't appreciate the gruesome violence, especially when you realize that you followed it all that way only to find a crippled ending."
3,A crime shocker that falls short,"""Seven"" is contrived and predictable, with none of ""Silence of the Lambs'"" suspense or narrative urgency. It tries to be artistic and cerebral, but ends up seeming pedestrian, even when trying to shock. Good acting by all the principals can't redeem the plot's artificiality. If you want to see Fincher's best by far, get ""Fight Club."""
2,Like a 2 hour Tool video,"I love most things dark, opressive, disturbing and stark, but this predictable-from-the-start investigation into the underbelly of human depravity failed to hold me past the thrid deadly sin. Creepy and sickening, I enjoyed the dirty feeling this movie left me with, but when the credits hold a higher artistic value than what's between them, it's hard to recommend a purchase."
5,13 year old girl,"When I bought Seven I thought it was going to be something really frightening, but it wasn't. This doesn't mean I didn't like it. At the beginning, it looks a bit boring, but slowly you get more interested. To people who are a bit overweight : just looking at the victim of ""gluttony"", it will make you want to start a diet. There's nothing in the movie that's not suitable for minors (for me, anyway). The best part was at the end... Wait and see..."
1,Invalid Disc,"My one star rating is for the Blu-ray disc, not the film. The film is great, I love it. Unfortunately the Blu-ray disc will not play on my Blu-ray player. I receive the same ""Invalid Disc"" error that many others have seen. I updated the firmware on my player and it still doesn't work. I have a decent Philips Blu-ray player. This is the only BRD I've ever had not work in my player. I'm now sad because I really wanted to watch this movie."
4,Wait for Re-Release,"Seven is a great film, but there is going to be a re-release that is a 2 disc set full of extras and it will be on one side."
1,ehh.... not bad,"""Seven"" deals with two police officers (played by thespians Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman) who are trying to track down and bring to justice a killer, except this is no ordinary killer. It is belief of the killer that he was sent through divine inspiration to put to death anyone in violation of the seven deadly sins."
1,Its a flipper,I wouldnt bother know matter how good a film is this DVD is a flipper. Nothing more annoying than having to turn a DVD half way through a film just because a film producer is to tight to pay for dual layer disks.
3,Movie should be seen but is still a movie,"This movie is still a movie...it is not a prophesy! You cannot say man is becoming worse, and this movie signifies it. Desensitization is not anymore apparent today then it was before. John Doe throughly deserved what he got, the 'reasonable person' in the end would probably have done the same. The filmmakers were wrong to talk of people in the way they did.... this wasn't really as intelligent or as insightful as it thought it was. It is not 'disgustingly beautiful'? How can oxymorons exist? Kevin Spacey's acting saved it..."
2,Pitt and Freeman in So- So Thriller,"I think this movie is way, way overrated. The film is shot nicely and everything, but there just isn't a very strong entertaining quality to it. It's dark and dingey. Normally, I like that sort of thing if it's done right. This is just too cold. The two stars are good. (spoiler) This movie isn't scary at all, nor is it very exciting. A pretty bland, mediocre offering that could've(and should've) been ten times better."
3,great actors don't make up for a so-so movie,"Seven was a bit of a disappointment to me. While the actors are, of course, top notch (who actually dislikes Morgan Freeman? You're a liar!) the actual storytelling in this movie left me feeling pretty bored and uninterested.I would have liked more in the way of atmosphere, instead of one storyline bit carefully moving along at a pace that almost put me to sleep a couple times.I understand most people like this movie, and that's perfectly fine with me, but it just wasn't good enough for me. Maybe if I give the movie a second chance I'll like it more. That's always a possibility. Sometimes the second time finally makes something click. Or maybe I'm just not smart enough to get it :)"
2,pointlessly unpleasant,"Fincher's a good director, and the film is visually impressive. It very successfully shocks and upsets the audience. Problem is, it is totally meaningless, totally devoid of substance. After the perfectly predictable but nonetheless disturbing finish, you realize that you have allowed yourself to get worked up about nothing at all.The film has plenty of stuff in it that could earn it 3 stars instead of 2, but the net effect of watching the film is negative. (I have nothing against upsetting films, but if they have no real reason to upset you, I'd rather steer clear. I was better off before I rented this thing than I am now.)"
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought these because they were so inexpensive - and you get what you pay for. First of all, the instructions say to test between 10am and 6pm. But after getting no positive results in 2 months, a friend of mine said to test after dinner (between 6pm and 10pm), and voila - a positive test appeared! However, the bad part was that I got the positive result only after my temp had spiked that morning (which says that I ovulated that day). So it did not predict the hormone surge 2-3 days before ovulation, like its supposed to. So buy these with that in mind. Maybe buy extra strips and test once after lunch and once after dinner. Good luck!"
4,Shipping to Canada,"These strips were a great bargain over the ones available in Canada(which cost about $55 CAN for 5-9 strips). I bought 10 OPK strips and 2 pregnancy test strips for $21 CAN. Just be aware that it took about 3 weeks for them to arrive, so if you're in a hurry buy the horribly overpriced ones at Shoppers Drug Mart or pick up a copy of ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" by Toni Wechsler--it's a great resource on natural signals of fertility (ovulation)."
3,A Unique Mystery,"I bought this book becauae 1. I enjoy detective novels and 2. Becauae it was mentioned in a recent book entitled 'Bad Twin' ""written"" by a passenger on the doomed Oceanic flight 815.If you're looking for a good yarn check this out. It's a fast read and it's fairly inexpensive. If you're looking for a LOST tie-in it's not here.The novelty of this story is that the case is solved before the book is two-thirds of the way through. I won't go on and spoil it but anyone who likes to solve mysteries or figure out the twist in stories should enjoy this one."
3,Ok for a beginner,"Book is detailed for the do it yourselfer with little or no prior experience. If your looking for more, such as performance applications, this book does not have much. I am an ASE certified mechanic, and I am disappointed in this book. Nice general information, but not much more. For example, almost no info on improving Magnum RT cylinder head port flow."
1,no good,this book sucks-no practical info that applies to only magnum's-mostly general info about engines and machining-not what I was hoping for
2,Terrible BD PQ quality,"Sorry, but I have to speak up regarding the picture quality of this BD release. It is, honestly, a shambles. Never have I seen so much dirt and so many specks. At the very minimum please remove the dust particles from the print. Also, as an older film I understand that there will be grain but c'mon: many scenes looked like it was snowing black snowflakes. The fact that some of the outdoor scenes were a marginable improvement over the DVD keeps this from receiving a bottom-barrel one star. Overall, I was shocked and disappointed at the sloppiness in this release. Buy at your own risk."
3,Fast delivery!!,"My item was shipped out two days after the order was placed and arrived the following day. I was very impressed. My one complaint would be the product (a DVD) was labeled ""like new"" and it was closer to ""good"" condition. The box doesn't close as properly as it should and the plastic on the box had ripples that could have been caused by the sun. The disk itself seems to be in good condition though I have not watched it yet. My complaints about these cosmetic details are because I ordered this as a gift and had I known the condition of the box I would have purchased a new copy.Hang 'Em High"
3,"A solid western, Clint's first after the Leone films","Hang 'em High is a good, entertaining western featuring a good performance by Clint and superior work by fine character actors in the supporting cast, including Pat Hingle. In this movie, Clint takes on once again the persona of an avenging angel, though this time he is on the side of the law (working for Hingle's hanging judge). There are shades of the upcoming Dirty Harry Callahan in this character when, after completing his mission and taking vengeance on the men who erroneously near-lynched him, Clint quits the employ of hanging judge Hingle as he cannot stand the hypocrisy of the judge's legalized killing.A very nifty tale of morality and vengeance that presages the great themes of director Eastwood's career."
4,Awesome Eastwood,"Not the best Eastwood film I've seen, but it still is a pleasure to watch. Eastwood is the best western actor that I've seen and he doesn't disappoint here."
5,Western Classic,"This film dosent get the praise of the ""Dollars"" trilogy,but it is one of Eastwoods best westerns. Action galore,great filming, and a good revenge plot. Western fans needthis."
3,"Fairly good, but not great","Is this film really PG13 in USA? In Finland it is not allowed below 15 years, which is as it should be. Of course, films are getting more and more violent, but more than this I do not care. There were a couple of things that were good in this film. One of them was Eastwood himself. The other actors were good, too. Ben Johnson is always great, but his part was very small. This is a typical revenge story. That's a main motive in westerns. Is it enough to get a man to risk his life until the rest of his life in order to finalize his evenge? In real life one hopefully would give up. Eventhough he was almost hanged. There were some loose ends in the story. Perhaps this was meant to be so. Inger Stevens is looking men who rape her, but does not find them. Eastwood is feeling pangs of mercy, but the film requires revenge. Was it really necessary to have the long hanging celebration? It took a great part of the film."
2,HANG'UM HIGH,"Ordered used,but advertised as like new. Came to me scratched and after I cleaned and polished one side (had two playing sides), it ran through my machine fine. I have a high end player that will play a disc that most will reject, so I may have been lucky to be able to make this movie run without problems."
2,Good but disapointing end!,"I didn't understand the ending of this book, I thought maybe my book was missing a page, I reread the ending and still didnot get it and was disapointed. Throughout the book I kept thinking there is something about these boys I couldn't put my finger on that they were special in some ethereal way. Some gratuitous sex scenes in this novel that took away from the story in some respects. Overall I was enjoying the story but the ending seemed to deminish the experience for me. I don't know what I expected but the end of this is definitely not it!"
3,A good read.....,"This was a good story. I gave it three stars because it starts out strong and close to the end, it fizzles out. Maybe too many characters and also the ending was weak."
1,Just recycled this awful book!,"First ever Amazon review here, written to spare people the thoroughly unsatisfying experience of trying to finish this unbelievably bad novel. Despite the glowing praise which persuaded me to purchase the book, it's poorly written, completely flat and one-dimensional, alternately sickly sweet and falsely gritty. It gets one star for a well-written public relations campaign that claims ""a modern-day parable"" -- driving the eye-ball-rolling reader to persist to the end in a desperate (and unfulfilled) need to know why this book was ever allowed to be published in the first place. Some editor failed to do his/her job!!"
3,Like Easy More.,"I love Walter Mosley. I think he's a gifted and brilliant writer. But for those coming to him for the first time, this wouldn't be the book I'd recommend.I remember reading early publisher reviews of this book and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. This modern day fable takes two boys: a charmed perfect blonde Adonis, and his African American 'brother' whose luck runs from bad to worse. Yet together their karma creates a perfect Ying and Yang that harmonizes both their lives. It's beautifully written, with Mosley writing the kind of searing and insightful passages I'm sure many writers can only aspire to. That said,for some reason I was left cold by the end, which is ironic because everything leading up to it said I should've been completely invested. If you've never read him before, I'd suggest cracking open the first Easy Rawlings mystery, 'Devil In A Blue Dress' which in my mind redefines the mystery genre."
5,"Great product, great price","I have a doby who had to live outside for four years. As a result, she lost her hair and was not in the best of health. We adopted her and research showed an enzyme product, good quality food, and patience would help her recover. Prozyme and Nutro Large Breed Adult took about 2-3 months but she looks like a different dog! Such a small easy way to turn a dog around by letting the good nutrients be absorbed by just sprinkling some Prozyme on their food each time you feed them. The price from this company is excellent, service outstanding, and delivered to my home. Now I have my White German Shepherd and a Golden mix on Prozyme and will continue to do what has worked so well. If it hadn't been for the great price, I would not have been able to do this for all three of my dogs. Thank you times three!"
1,Waste of money,"This product does not work. I've had tinnitus for about a year now, and all the books I read about it said that pills don't work to help reduce or eliminate tinnitus. But, I was desperate to try anything after other treatments had failed. I tried Ring Stop, taking 2 capsules twice a day for two months, as they recommended. It had absolutely no impact on my tinnitus. There was no reduction in the noise in my ears. This product does not work, it does not reduce one's tinnitus (at least in my experience) and I would strongly encourage you not to waste your money on it, as I did. I wish it would have worked, believe me, but as all the books say--and which I now must disappointingly admit--taking pills will not eliminate tinnitus. My experience with Ring Stop certainly proved that."
3,non-stop ringing,"It hasn't stopped the ringing, but the ringing is much lower. This is the second bottle I have tried. I will give it one more time."
1,Part Discontinued.,"They discontinued the ""Blade Gasket"" part that was on early models. It is common that they break then it is useless. I will never own another product made by Waring Pro."
1,Waste of money,"I replaced my cheap $20.00 electric slicer with this one, and I am sorry that I did. The cheap plastic electric one sliced better than this one, and clean up was a snap, unfortunaly the gears wore out. This one ""tears"" the meat and I cannot get a thin uniform deli slice on lunchmeat. It is ok on a roast except that you cannot clean the machine completely. The slide bar hangs up because food gets stuck in the slide wheel, bad bad design. I would not recommend this to anyone...keep looking."
3,"Very nice, but a bit too modern","This is a very nice, large format, book full of quality illustrations. My only complaint is that the latter half of the book is devoted almost exclusively to modern (futurists, surrealists, abstractionist, etc.) arts. If the entire book had been devoted to real artists - those who paint recognizable subjects and do it well - then this book would merit 5 stars."
4,great toning workout,get ready for bikini season with this dvd set! it is a bit cheesy but it works! will have you sore and feeling more toned the first week.
5,Awesome!!!!!!,"Sooooo, I just received this today. I'm latina, 5'11, 147 lbs and somewhat athletically built. I decided to give the bum bum and high and tight workout a try. WOW!!! I can barely walk and I worked out muscles in my abductor and adductor I thought i never had. I thought my gym leg workout was hard, but this is just as difficult and I""m only using a band and my body weight. I'm not much for words but if you have to spend money on something to target the saddle bags and inner/outer thighs then this is definitely it and the cardio portion is incredible and fun :)"
1,"""High and Tight"" Disc does not work properly","They (Beach Body) have replaced this disc for us 6 times and none of the discs have played properly. They claim it must be a problem with our DVD player. Really?! All 7 DVD/blue-ray/Playstation players in our house play the disc the same way, ie it works for two workouts then automatically skips to an advertising loop. Pain in the arse!!!"
2,Good workout--but commercials!?!?,"The Brazil Butt Lift - WorkoutBrazil Butt Lift - Workout DVD (English and Spanish), is challenging and is definitely a good workout. However I will never buy a workout DVD from the Beachbody company again. It is extremely annoying that before and after a workout (in between the workouts)--commercials play to feature other Beachbody workouts or to talk about their website. When I am ready to watch a workout dvd I want to get right into the workout and do not want to be disrupted with commercials (needing to stop and fast-forward through them)--in my opinion Beachbody created a poor customer experience. While the workout is good and I am feeling the results, the annoyance of the DVDs makes me not want to use them, instead I may do the exercises on my own."
5,Great for women,These videos are hard and my wife is losing weight in her thighs and hips. I did it and I was tired and I work out on a regular doing cardio and heavy weights. I recommend it to anyone but its primarily for women.
5,IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!!,"I love it! It is one of the best workout DVD's that I have purchased. I was a little sore after the first couple of days, but now I am getting use to it."
5,Brazil Butt Kick!,I love workout DVD's and am pretty fit. I usually use Jillian Michaels and Jari Love. I get bored from time to time and like to mix it up. I was looking for something for my lower body since I'm pear shaped but I was also looking for something fun. I got both in this program. I've just completed week one and my lower body feels like it's already more toned. The Bum Bum workout is only 30 minutes and I have to pause a few times to catch my breath! I'm sure after another week or two I'll make it through but it's a great lower body toning and cardio all in one. Can't wait to continue and see the results I will get. The girls bodies in the video which are great (but not too skinny!) are inspiring and the beach scenes liven things up. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to get a great workout and have fun at the same time!
2,Not crazy about this product,"The order arrived on time, however two of the disks won't play when you first load them . You have to keep fiddling with them to get them to work. I don't know if they were copied or what, can't remember exactly the message it gives, but I remember when reading it, I wondered if it meant the disk had been copied."
4,Truth Be Told,"Ok, so I purchased the DVD. I'm 30 and I want to ensure my butt gradually falls not drop like a flat pancake. LOLBut seriously, this tape is a LITTLE FAST PACED. Its wonderful having a motivated instructor but they should really put the level of the individuals listed somewhere. I have to bascially build my self up and still am not near with completing one session. The moves take TIME to do correctly. They are advanced and require balance. The instructor is a ballet professional but I don't believe he really took into account the women or men that were buying this. I haven't done ballet since I was a child and probably spent a few months due to my attention span became bored.But I believe if you continue with the program you will be able to complete the series and receive effective results.So good luck to the buyers.P.S. Be patient and stop when you feel pain - Its not worth hurting yourself."
2,disappointed,"I'm not disappointed with the aactual workout because I haven't gotten to even try it yet. When I put the dvd in it lets you choose english or spanish, I continued to hit english and its not programming. I contacted beachbody directly and told them the problem. They asked me numberous times for my order number then after keeping me on hold for fifteen mins the man told me they'd have to call me back within 48 hours...It's been TWO weeks and I've heard NOTHING! WOW I'm actually shocked considering I always thought beachbody was supposed to be a great company with good service! BUMMED"
4,short and sweet,"This plan is a lot of work, but I'm enjoying it. It's fun and kind of silly and that makes it easier for me to stick to. As for the 6-day slim down; I'm a vegetarian, so I used substitutions, but I lost 8 pounds in 5 days. I wasn't expecting it to work at all, but it's worked better than anything else at keeping me exercising. I don't think this plan is for everyone - I didn't have much weight to loose when I started (15 lbs), I really just wanted a work out that I liked and could do at home."
4,Southern Cross Vs North Star,"In the last book published in the Fist series, the ultimate battle is unleashed and the two leading experts in their styles, Kenshiro and Ray are forced to do battle for the sake of the people they love. The villain gets his comuppence and Ken turns his attention to the man who kidnapped Ray's sister, his own brother Jagi, who has been impersonating Ken out of jealousy. Jagi harbors deep hatred for Kenshiro because he was chosen to become the Fist of the North Star and he wasn't. The book ends with a scene the movie goers will remember from the anime and we're in for a shock that I won't reveal. But, it's a shock that is highly irritating as Viz hasn't released a fifth Fist book and we're left hanging. Still, a worthy addition to any martial arts of anime/manga fan's shelf."
3,NOT Wheat or Gluten Free,"Contrary to what Amazon description says (as of day I'm writing this anyway) these are not Wheat/Gluten free, one of the ingredients is Wheat sprout and rainbow light website does not state they're wheat/ gluten free either.My kids are allergic to gluten and my 2 year old was getting very moody...I suspect it was these because as soon as I realized they have wheat and threw them away he's back to his happy self.If my kids did not have allergy I'd probably still be using them."
4,"Good Text, but difficult translations","I enjoyed using this book in school, but found some of the translations difficult do. The subject material and grammar is very easy to follow and learn!"
5,Brilliant!,"Robert Beer's book is a feast, a master work. I will turn to it time and time again. No practicing Tibetan Buddhist should be without this in her library. Thank you so much, Mr. Beer for what you have given us. As I was reading your book, I was looking at my thankgas more closely than I ever have before, understanding them in ways I never could before."
1,Load saved game,I got this 4/12 and played around with it. I did a save game and continued play. When I was caught in the shire by the blackrider I reloaded the game and got nothing but static for sound. Load saved game sound quality is absolutely horrible.I kept getting caught by the black rider and could not get past the first level. It seems like a fun game but I will be returning it in trade for something playable with better sound quality.
2,Not Enough Freedom,"With the simply massive world of Middle-Earth, one would expect that any games based in that world would give you at least SOME freedom or nonlinear gameplay opportunities. Unfortunately, this game goes against such expectations. There are quite literally only 1-2 paths for every segment of the game. Sometimes you can not even climb some hills or walk beyond a certain point in a grass field, the boundaries are so restrictive. The content remains fairly weak as well. Graphics are decent, but nowhere near jaw-dropping. Sound is not even worth noting. Fighting with Frodo grows dull, and fighting with Gandalf's magic is too gimped. The various fights while playing Aragorn are, in my opinion, the only pluses of the entire game. Nontheless, that bumps my rating to a 2."
3,Short-lived Fun,"While this game offers spectacular graphics (and the graphics are the reason I gave this game 3 stars instead of 2), it falls short in the gameplay department. First off, if you haven't read the book and have only seen the movie, there are parts of the game that you won't recognize. The game is wonderful the first time through, and very addictive. Although once you finish the game, there isn't much left to do. There isn't any varying difficulty levels. I finished the game withing 2 days of buying it, perhaps with a max of 5 hours of gameplay. Again, while the first time through is a blast, the game just isn't worth this price. Its a one-shot game, so I'd wait until the price goes down."
3,Can We Say Overrated!,"I was thouroughly impressed with the cutscenes and thats about it. The gameplay was difficult: it was very hard to move around esp as Frodo and the game itself was short. And also the puzzles.....cmon Ive had harder things to solve as a toddler puttin the square peg in the round hole. Overall, I was very dissappointed."
1,They should be ashamed.,"My wife bought this game with a rebate, so that the net cost to us was nothing, and I still feel like we were taken. The game is entirely linear, and you're given five stupid tasks even before you leave the Shire.The controls are poor, and not intuitive. The game moves slowly. And if you run into a dark rider, you don't fight him, the game just ends.The one positive is that the graphics are well done.If this were a different title, no one would ever buy it. It's a crime to give this game the same title as Tolkien's books."
2,.. replay value... online multiplayer?........,"Even though Lord of the Rings will be an awesome game, once you beat it, there will be nothing more to do. It seems like one of those games with absoultely no replay value..... One way to fix taht would be to support online gaming, however this game does not do so.... therefore its one of thsoe games taht u beat in about 2-3 weeks... and then it gets to collect dust on ur shelf.... anyway, it still looks like an awesome game, for the amount of time it will last!"
5,Marco Polo - Spanish Edition,"I ordered this book after my year experience in China. I expected an English version, but it actually is Spanish.The book is beautiful, but unfortunately I cannot read it. Helpdesk did not offered money back. A pitty."
3,Best???,This began to read like a lengthy advertisement for TM classes (available from a teacher near you) backed up with anecdotal evidence and anonymous medical studies (or studies done by TM-friendly physicians) Caveat emptor.
4,It did what its supposed to do: lightup the road,"If you're looking to improve your visibility with high beams, no matter the output color, these are the bulbs for you...Amber/white color, and better road illumination you will get with these high beam bulbs. Nothing more to say.DON'T buy them if you're looking for super white or bluish color."
2,Older iMacs can't do both OS X and 9,"Some features of OS X 10.2 are definitely better, faster on OS X 10.2 than on OS 9.1, but there are several anomalies when interfacing with a Windows dominated world, more than with OS 9.1, such as setting up email (Outlook doesn't seem to work with OS X 10.2), scrolling the sddress book, etc.The main problem is that on my iMac DV+ (bought late summer 2000), I can't run both Classic and OS X 10.2 - the OS X 10.2 install discs told me I had to do a complete memory wipe of all my Classic documents and applications (I bought an external hard drive to store these but can't start up on it). When I called Apple to see about options to run both Classic and OS X, the technician told me that they no longer supported the older iMac's and that help was $49/question!"
1,Nearly bottom of the Christmas Movie Pile,I did not think that this movie was all that great. I bought it about 7 years ago and I have only watched it once (if that). There are much better Christmas Movies out there for your time and money.
5,One of the Best Books of the Year,"Cecilia Ahern has a knack for writing books that deal with subjects otherwise left alone in Chick Lit. A big fan of her work, I was skeptical about this book because of the vague descriptions on the jacket. After reading the book, I now know why the description was written the way it was- you would not want the book given away to you before you had a chance to read it.This is an endearing, well-written and emotional book full of funny moments as well as touching moments. A great book to sit down with that fully engulfs you and bring you into the story."
2,"It's nice, that's about it","I am almost done reading this book, and I found that for the size of the book, not very much has happened. Although some lovely moments, so much of it was predictable and had me rolling my eyes! I found the characters to be really annoying, especially Ivan, the invisible friend. I just couldn't warm to him, and found him to be sappy. The writing is @'ok' if that, and it seems to ramble on and on in so many areas."
1,Totally different from her last 2 books - not in a good way!,I was so excited to read this book but what a huge disappointment it turned out to be. I LOVED Cecelia Ahern's Love Rosie and P.S. I Love You and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. I had to force myself to finish it. Huge let down.
1,Disappointing read,I was very disappointed with this book and barely got through it. The characters didn't catch my interest and found the relationship with Ivan strange. I like fantasy but this wasn't my type of book. Don't think I'll be reading this author again.
5,One of the greatest albums ever made,"Lots of folks don't like this album. It is fundamentally different than the Connells other albums, but it just flat out rocks. I highly recommend you pick this up and take a listen to it."
1,Got my hopes up only to dash them.,"I used these tests as directed. I was quite excited to get a faint line for the first time after months of ttc. I was quite disappointed when that line couldn't be duplicated on any store brand test. The lines kept coming, even some darker than others but af showed on time. I then tried the test about a week into my next cycle and got the same faint line. These tests are duds and heart breaking. I am very sorry I wasted my money on them."
2,Fair but not their best.,"This is a fair if not rushed effort from 3EB. I loved their self titled album and New Girl from the American Pie soundtrack. My high hopes were quickly dashed after the pretty good, if not short Anything. Deep Inside of You is really the only other outsanding song on this CD. The rest are hard to understand brecause of a overly heavy use of echos, midi, and other uneeded audio effects. My question is why ohhh why! Third Blind has always had great music, vocals, and lyrics. Why do you cover them up by these ugly sounding effects? Please, 3EB, next time stick to what made you such an outstanding band, great sounding, hard rocking, heart felt music!"
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,If you loved their first album like I did and still do you will be disappointed with this mess. Yes there are a FEW decent songs on here but they stray so far from their first album its almost annoying. I have tried to give this album many listens and I still cant get fully into it. Thank god I didnt pay for it(I got it as a promo)
5,"Not as good as debut album, but still amazing!!! Must Have!!","I don't understand why they had to edit Slow Motion, but other than that they kick every critic who said their 1st album was too whiny, and too pop right in the ass!! They start with a hard, fast ""Anything"", followed by the best song, lyrically and musically in ""Wounded"" ""10 Days Late"" ""Never Let You Go, and Deep Inside of You"" speak for themselves, as does the great story in ""1,000 Julys"" Camoflauge is the only real question mark on the album, besides ""Slow Motion"", which is available on Napster unedited!!! I don't hear any real crisp lyrics, save for the chorus in Camoflauge, but Arion, Tony and Brad do their shit on all tracks, they never quit, and all the songs are a musical trip!! GET THIS CD!!!"
4,Good--but not as good as the first one,"I bought this cd because I have their debut album, and I loved it. This cd is pretty good. It's got diverse and original music. This cd is more dance music than the last. It's got a lot more parts that are just symphonic. This cd is good to listen to in the car. Not exactly all the hits as the last one, it has ""Anything"" which clocks in at exactly 2 minutes, none of the other songs on the cd quite compare to that one. This is kind of a relaxing cd, with nice tunes. Oh, and do forget, there's a bonus* track about 18 minutes after the last song."
4,Blue: Kinda cheerful,"I was excited to buy the new Third Eye Blind CD after enjoying their previous album, Semi Charmed Life. Although similiar in most aspects, it shows that 3EB has more talent, and diversity. The CD wrapping only mentioned the first song, ""Anything"", as a hit. However, most of these songs are all hits. For 3EB fans it's a must buy. P.S. Enjoy the secret track 19 minutes after the last song ends."
4,be patient,"after the first week i stopped comparing this album to their first release, which is a favorite of mine. the sound is great and so are the lyrics. this album is very addicting and there is no need to skip any songs."
5,Original Music,"Third Eye Blinds Music has always appealed to me, but I could never figure out why. However I think I finaly figured it out. You have your rap, and you have your punk, and you have your pop (i.e. Backsteet Boys, and Nsync) where once you've heard one song all the others sound that same. So when you get tired of one group, you loose intrest in others. But when it comes to thrid eye blind, there is no other group like them, therefor you never get tired of listing to them.This CD, though a little strange at times, is just great music. When they made the CD they weren't set in any boundrys on what type of music to make....They just wanted to make great music that people would listen to...and I think they succeded."
3,Not bad for an alternative band...,"The opening cut ""Anything"" is a fantastic way to kick off 3EB's ""Blue,"" however it's unfortunately the best cut on the album. ""Wounded"" and ""An Ode to Maybe"" are two other standouts, but to be honest the rest of the CD sounded like the rest of the vanilla ""alternative"" bands out there. Alternative just ain't ""alternative"" any more - it's now pop music. That being said, 3EB is a pretty good pop band."
2,Prepare to be disappointed,"Although Blue has a few worthwhile songs (Wounded, 1000 Julys), it is best described as a vomit-inducing decaying pile of ... . (To put it lightly) The poetic lyrics and mellow instrumentals that defined Third Eye Blind as more than just another mainstream rock band have been traded in for empty babblings that have relatively no artistic value. In fact, many of these songs made me doubt Jenkins' sanity. Does he really feel that strongly about basketballs, or did he simply need a cheap rhyme? Although this album may appeal to a larger group of people, it is defintely a step down from the lyrical genius that was Third Eye Blind pre-Blue."
2,troubled,"I like 3eb. But as i browsed the lyrics of the new album, I couldnt help but feel that the band was pushing what they had so that they could get an album out before christmas. Its still 3eb but songs like "" 10 days late "" are horrible. imagine sitting down and writing a song like that. there has been alot of conversation about the edited track "" slow motion "". The morons at the record company strike again, keeping meaningful music out of the ears of America. Everyone needs to hear this song, personally I can live without the album."
5,Still good...,"I'd have to agree with many reviews I've read in the past: while 3EB's debut album contained all good songs, 'Blue' contains some very good ones (including some of my favorite 3EB songs), but some good songs, but not as likeable as the rest of their work.The album has 2 types of songs: 'pop' songs (such as 'Never Let You Go', '10 Days Late'), and 'rockier' songs (such as 'Darkness'). Most people either like one or the other. Sophomore albums usually have that trait of not knowing where to go, and whether to publish something that has more radio apppeal or to go on with the style they've tried setting with their first album. 3EB has made a good effort of combining the two, and even though I can't say I love all the songs on this album, I still find them a lot better than a lot of other stuff..."
1,pretty poppy music,sweet songs if u like that trendy bs. if u like that blinky dinky 182 cheese then u would also like this pop corn sheeeat.
5,3eb - amazingly talented and unique,"This band has changed my outlook on life and everything. So many bands out today sound like each other, but Third Eye Blind's new CD ""Blue"", along their debut CD, shine with talent. The band's four members sing with feeling, play with passion, and shake floors. Songs like ""10 Days late"" and ""An Ode to Maybe"" are heartfelt. Every song has a different beat, the guitars are amazing; I can't go a day without listening to it or I feel like I've missed something. If you want to fall into some enthralling music, try it out."
5,Can't wait for the next one...,"When I heard the first single off of ""Blue"" (Anything) I was expecting a great punk album. After giving it a spin, I was sadly disappointed in this. But then I listened closer. Inside this wicked packaging is a very solid sophomore effort, granted that there are some filler, but then so did their original (See ""Burning Man""). A few of the songs on this album are experimental, but most of them pay off. If there was one thing I could change in this album it would be that the full version of ""Slow Motion"" made it to the cd instead of the Elektra-approved chorus-only version. All in all, a worthy effort and worth the money."
5,Just music...,"WEll their music's usually called alternative rock i guess,but i do not agree with that,coz i think it's really difficult to name the genre they perform.. Whatever kind it is,they sure do it in the best way.About the album;well it really does not try to stand under the 'shade' of the success of their last release.This one is a masterpiece,and it's obvious that they got into the studio without any concerns about any genre or any financial problems.They just played,and they did it in the best way possible.Openning with a short but fast 'Anything', Blue strikes directly at your heart and brain.The upcoming tracks cool down and they're much stronger that the first track. Especially 'Slow Motion','Deep Inside Of You' and 'Never Let You Go' are just GREAT!Go get this CD,you won't regret it.We did not!"
2,Third Eye Blues,"I bought it for my husband who likes the band and he really didn't like the cd at all. He found a song or two that he didn't mind, but really didn't like it. It could just be us, but we weren't entertained at all."
3,Slow Motion Where are you?,"I LOVE this new album, but the best song is the unsensored version of Slow Motion. If you havent heard it, you are missing out. I was very dissapointed that it wasnt on the CD. My fav track is anything for you. Go buy it now :)"
4,Better and more serious then 3EB,"This is a CD that anyone that loves rock music should buy. I am a big music fan, who buys CD's left and right, and so i always try to make the most of my cds, and try to like all the songs. Sometimes that is hard to do though, but that was not the case on Blue. After one listen through the CD, i liked every song, and then with every additional listen, i liked the songs more and more. Most notably are the songs ""Wounded"", ""10 Days Late"", and ""The red summer sun"". If you can, just listen to one of those songs, and you will be hooked. This is a magnificant CD that combines amazing music and seriousness."
5,Childhood remembered,It really takes you back to your memories of these shows. Only problem is you will want to watch them after hearing the theme song.
2,beware of color,I expected ecru to be off white maybe lite tan. The color of the sheet I recieved was a true dull yellow.
1,finish doesn't match Mac!,"I was so disappointed to receive this. It functioned fine, and the design was definitely phoned in (which I recognized ahead of time but I ordered anyway), but despite the photos, the metal finish doesn't look anything like the anodized metal finish that comes on Mac laptops or monitors. Instead, it's sort of a cheap-knockoff-looking kind of finish that really cheapens the whole awesome-desk aesthetic I was going for! So I returned it -- and got hit with their 25% restocking fee! I can't say I'm a huge fan of Macessity at the moment...."
5,Still got 'sauce' ...,"i was dragged to a concert back in the early 90's in a small bar in DC, and this guy gets up and starts wailing on his harmonica. there must have been less than 100 of us in this place, and he hooked all of us from his first note. i've been a g-love believer ever since (and admitting a minor slip with ""electric mile"", but he had enough behind him to overlook it), and this album does not stray. we played it through the first time and can honestly say that i didn't want it to end. the production is top-rate, and every song on this album shows why he has such staying power. he refuses to slide into the mainstream while staying true to his unique sound and style, and this album can count as one of his best."
5,Enjoying My Empty Nest,"Not only does this book have wonderful recipies that I turn to time and again for taste, elegance, and simplicity, but the essays touch my heart, reminding me of the importance of building relationships and how they change and evolve over time. The nest is never empty for long; we're always cooking for someone and this book makes it easy!"
4,.Mac is Fantastic!,"Apple's suite of online tools is an incredible way to extend your digital hub, and as Apple keeps adding features and services, the value keeps going up!If you'd like to see examples of what others are doing with their .Mac accounts, check out [the website].Check it out, then buy a .Mac subscription! You won't be disappointed!"
1,cups unnatural,"I had high hopes for this bra as it has received awards, but I found the cups to make me look very unnatural. They seem to actually ""point"" out and to the right. Not like Madonna, but not what I expected either."
1,This is Rubbish,I have a Diploma in Color therapy and I was looking forward to receiving this based on the reviews. What a waste of money and time. It is a movie of colors and has no color to illness programs at all. I do think you will get some benifit out of it but not what you would from a true color therapy treatment.Don't waste your money
4,"Colorized, SP speed","Republic chose this title and ZOMBIES OF THE STRATOSPHERE to condense into a shorter feature, and it was a wise move. Both have much slower spots that can be removed without any harm to the story. Every chapter in both is there, including the cliffhangers. There's just a little cut out in between. I love both of these serials and recommend the colorized VHS over the black and white full length version."
5,The Stooges rock. Hard.,"I'm unfamiliar with the David Bowie mix of Raw Power, but I can safely say that this album is awesome. I mean that literally. You will be in awe after listening to first few minutes of this music. Yes it's loud, but it's supposed to be loud! It is not unlistenable to at normal volume levels. If anything, it's unlistenable to at low volumes. The Stooges MUST be loud! That's the whole f***ing punk ethos! After listening to just the first three tracks of this, I fell in love with The Stooges, as I'm sure any of you will, if you have any appreciation for some hard rock. Even if you usually don't dig punk, this is somewhat of a far cry from what would be considered punk by the late 70s. It is very guitar-oriented."
2,"Best unreleased tracks not on this, live sound is mediocre","The best unreleased tracks will be on the 3 CD ""Deluxe Edition"" which will retail at over $60! That's a rip off and a good reason to pass this up. All you really get here is the Atlanta show, but the sound quality isn't fantastic - the piano is louder than either guitar!"
2,Overrated,"This CD is not as good as you may have heard. It's not what I would call revolutionary--terrible lyrics, inept playing, and an overall muddy sound make this nearly unlistenable. A few good moments but too much crap to slog through."
1,"Unlistenable, literally","I think iggy is playing a bit of a joke on us with this one. The volume is all the way down on this recording, so you have to crank your speakers up all the way. The treble is all the way up, and the bass is all the way down. Some of the guitar solos also seem to have a drastic increase in the already jacked up treble, making for a harsh squeeking noise that actually hurts your ears. It's like listening to AM radio on a small transistor radio with a 2 inch speaker. It really sounds like an awful quality live bootleg, and I'm not talking about the bonus live disc it comes with. The volume of the vocals also fluctuates wildly, and most of ""Gimmie Danger"" has no drums, just a hi-hat and cymbals. This is a drastically different mix from the original 1973 bowie mix. At times this recording resembles the screeching sounds heard on albums by Throbbing Gristle. Either listen to the original or the 1997 remastered/remixed version."
4,"Very Good Product, hard to find","I've never seen this product in the stores, but I saw it on line and bought it. I like wet look gels and this is one of the better brands I've tried. I plan to order more."
1,"Poor Construction, Terrible Design","I have no idea who left these other reviews but the product I received was a cheaply made import that would not even hold up my 7'10"" Tuflite without ripping two holes in my wall (not to mention my surfboard falling off). There are two bolts connecting the base of the rack to the ""hook"" and those bolts have a substantial convex head that prevent the rack from aligning flush against the wall. Additionally, there is only one small bolt hole to mount each rack to the wall. Even with a Molly Bolt, the racks ripped right out of the wall. This product is poorly constructed and, in my opinion, dangerous. Do not risk damaging your board and your walls with this product."
5,new to japanese review,"I just finished japanese 1 at my college and my instructor suggested this dictionary for japanese 2. so as a beginner knowing very few kanji, i found this dictionary a breeze to use.i have been using this for translating some of my manga and the biggest difficulty is probably counting the number of strokes in the kanji i was looking up; which was a problem with the manga, not the dictionary. even if that is a problem, you can look up the kanji by pronounciation in the back.there are also a lot of cool features in the back: counters, kanji known by certain grade levels, and even history.worth the money."
5,work gloves,"Great price, great gloves. These are amongst the best on the market. Rugged, yet comfortable.I purchased an entire case because they are great."
1,not so good,"It worked great for a month and a half, and then it just snapped where the tether attached to the latch. It's supposed to hold a dog up to 110 lbs, and ours is only around 70 lbs. Of course, it broke just after I could get a refund."
5,Works great,The leash works smoothly and is sturdy enough for my 70 pound lab. Other leashes have raveled but so far so good with this one.
5,"Fast, Melodic, its the f*ckin' Hate Crew!","Children Of Bodom have been around since 1997. They are a great band that deserves alot of credit. They, imo, are the leaders of melodic death metal. Hate Crew Deathroll is one of the bands best work. From the melo-thrash anthem 'Needled 24/7' to the end riff of 'hate crew deathroll' this album is perfect. The riffs, the basslines, the drum fills, the black metal vocals, its all here. I cannot stress enough how good this band is. The only problem with this album is that after the song 'hate crew deathroll', there is still 3 minutes of silence. I'm stuck there thinking, wtf? but its all okay because its the end of the album so you can just stop it after the song is over.Best songs in order1. Angels Don't Kill2. Six Pounder3. Triple Corpse Hammerblow4. Needled 24/75. You're better off dead6. Bodom Beach Terror7. Hate Crew Deathroll8. Lil' Blood red riding hood9. Chokehold (cocked n' loaded)Best album of 2004. No doubt."
4,The road leading to perfection,"True - this is not Tristania's best CD.True - this one only had four tracks.But if I told you you still get value for your money - wouldn't that say something about the quality of the music? Buy this - listen to it, and I'm quite sure you'll search everywhere to get a hold of their full-length album, ""Widow's Weeds"". Hopefully, it too will be available here soon, but to make things easier for you - try Napalm Records, or Napalm Records America.Get the CD - it's unbelievable."
5,Great widescreen TV. version,"Good movie, you see this movie on widescreen television, it will give the feeling that you are in the movie. It is srounded sound and a good picture qualty."
1,Looks can be deceiving!,"When I first looked at the song titles, I thought that this CD would be great. Great songs, great artists. But what I didn't know is that EVERY song is remade by someone else, and only a couple songs (Tearin' Up my Heart--yeesh!, Bawitdaba, and Last Kiss) sound the same. Do NOT buy this CD if you want the real deal."
4,A nice little compendium of the occult,"While Wheatley's ""right-handed"" moralizing gets tiresome, this book is a useful introduction to each avenue of the occult. His particular blend of history with parapsychology makes it less tedious a read. I feel generous giving this book 4 stars, but I cannot justify 3 since the author is so very thorough in his research. This book provides whets the appetite for further study of ""world of the unseen"" for the beginning occultist, or for a philosopher in general. Read this for an overview, though be prepared to ignore some heavyhanded opinions."
4,A Twist on Christmas music,Twisted Sister is not normally my genre of musicTwisted Christmas. I heard it at work and loved it. The 12 Days of Christmas is my favorite. The lyrics are hilarious! I was surprised at how tame many of the song arrangements turned out to be.
3,Not awful,"I'll say that Twisted Sister's renditions of classic Christmas songs are actually pretty decent. It's probably an okay album to put on at a Christmas party, nothing particulary atrocious and some people might even get a kick out of it.That said, I will remind you that these are all 'classic' Christmas songs. Nothing original save for the obligatory 12-days parody at the end of the album. They are nice renditions, but come on really? Are most Christmas songs in the public domain now? I can understand doing a few but if you're going to do ONE parody, do more than one. Or, crazy idea, an original composition?"
5,Twisted Christmas for everyone!,Dee & the Boys did a fantastic job on this hair band rock style of the Christmas classics plus the Heavy Metal Christmas slams! So many rock stars old and new doing the same old usual dribble of Christmas tunes that make me sick to hear over and over again on the radio but Twisted Christmas deserve air play. Play it loud and have some holiday spirits and sing along. Thanks TS
4,A Christmas album like no other...,"I'm not a big Twisted Sister fan but I had heard some buzz about this CD just after it's release and was intrigued enough to buy it. I'm not disappointed! Dee Snider and the boys take some great heavy metal songs (including a few of their own hits) and melded them with some classic Christmas tunes. The result is a Christmas album that is far from cheesy. Lita Ford duets with Dee on ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"", which uses TS's ""The Price"" for the music. If you listen closely, you'll find songs from Judas Priest, AC/DC and Black Sabbath cozying up to the holiday classics. There is one original song on the disc, a heavy metal version of ""The 12 Days of Christmas"". Do yourself a favor...get this CD!"
3,good mystery; boring people,"The bad guys were the most interesting characters in this story. The good guys are pretty boring. This puts me in position of deciding whether to continue reading this series as I don't expect the O'Conners to get very interesting but the stories are very well written with no idiotic endings. The main characters are Cork O'Conner, the ex-sheriff of small norhern Minnesota town who is part Ashinnabe (sp?) and his wife Jo, a lawyer who represents the local tribe.This mystery evolves around the arson of a logging company and arson-related death of a tribal leader. Was it murder or an accident? Was he the arsonist or innocent? The story leads to the kidnapping of the logging company's owner's family and the kidnapping of Cork's wife and son."
1,Memorex have a high rate errors,I have used many brands of DVD+R/DVD-R. Memorex seems to have a high rate of unsuccessful burns. I would recommend another brand. TDK seems to be my favorite. Never any problems and more affordable.
1,COASTERS!,"I purchased this item and was excited to get them, but burning my first DVDs.. they're all coasters! ARG.. pass Memorex and go for a more expensive media, like Verbatim."
5,Excellent guidebook for house music...,"I take this little book with me everytime I go record shopping. Concise and accurate histories of all the DJ's and record labels that make house music what it is. If you're a house DJ, buy it! I guarantee you'll learn a thing or two, even if you've been a DJ forever."
3,Not as it appears,"At the risk of sounding petty, the ax is slathered in blue paint. The manufacturer responded to my concern by stating that is the brand color and now their axes will conform to the company color.I would rather have had the product as it appeared as I will now have to buff off the color.The blade is also quite dull so a good sharpening is required.Overall, it appears to be a good product.Time to change the marketing pictures, lads."
4,very cute,"The novel kept me amused the whole way through - I liked the fad basis. I think Willis went overboard when creating some of the slacker-girl characters, but it all works out."
3,"An entertaining, well written compendium of fads.","A compilation of well researched fad history woven with Ms. Willis' understanding of scientific corporate behavior. Unfortunately for corporate America, her understanding is fairly accurate for most organizations, which makes the description of corporate management's behavior identifiable to a large readership, scientific and non-scientific.The Author's ability to link fads with corporate social behavior is somewhat superficial but effective. But then the entire book is light reading for groupies against corporate bureaucracy, i.e., the cartoon character ""Dilbert"", et. al.Categorizing the book as ""Science Fiction"", however, is somewhat of a stretch even if the author is touted by the Denver Post as ""One of Science Fiction's Best Writers."""
5,Screwball Comedy,"I love this book to death! It's marketed as science fiction -- mainly because Connie Willis is a science-fiction author -- but I don't think it really is. It's a novel about science and scientists. It's also a wacky, screwball romantic comedy. It's a great deal of fun! Lighthearted and funny, but it also deals with some deeper issues -- specifically, the nature of scientific discovery. It was a joy to read."
1,One of the worst movies ever made.....,"Bad acting, writing, directing, camera angles, color, voice overs and editing. Not even the boy candy can hold your interest until the end of this mess."
4,Where is the mystery ?,"Though the 5th book keeps the charm of the series intact, I feel the book is too heavy with character development (of already well-developed characters) and very, very short on plot. The one case Precious has never develops into more than a shrug of the shoulders. The depth of the previous four books is lacking in this one. Still if you're a fan, as I am, you probably won't be more than slightly let down and still wait in breathless anticipation of the next (hopefully more plot-heavy)book in the series."
3,May be better for coach or parent than a player,"I watched this dvd with my two sons ages 14 and 21 after the younger one announced he wanted to concentrate on getting better at basketball during the off season. They liked it, but they watched it the one time and not again so far. They were impressed it was made by Steve Nash. They prefer to be out on the court playing or getting direct instruction or drill rather than watching a dvd. This may be better suited for a coach or a parent looking for tips to help younger players."
5,The Jew Store,"This book came quickly and was in excellent shape, as promised. I have just begun it but the topic is interesting. I know that already since this family was a pioneering Jewish family in the US South who I am sure had a lot of prejudice to overcome. I am reading it for a book group-good book for book group discussions."
5,A wonderful read,"I did not know of the history of 'jew stores', and though not quantifiable, it seems that it was a common thing. The need to have a community with others of the same religion and cultures can be very strong. This book showed this need in sometimes sad circumstances but it was a rich story of family. I would recommend it without qualification."
2,Halloween,"I was disappointed in this CD. I'm a follower of figure skating, having been in competition myself at the time when dinosaurs were still around. But this movie has some tremendous skating, but for the most part the costume and make up of he skaters are so dark that it's really a distraction. And Nancy Kerrigan does too much talking between scenes, and she's not a very good 'public speaker."
1,Poor quality graphic,"I bought this t-shirt for my son on impulse, and I am sorry I did. The graphic is not only fuzzy, but the black on the smile actually ran into the yellow, like a bad magic marker drawing. I could have made the same shirt at home with an iron and ink jet iron on transfer material and it would have looked nicer. Save your money!"
4,Buy This CD!,"I have to echo the words of the previous reviewers. This is a very good album. I bought it in '93, didn't like it. I hauled it out again perhaps 5 years later and gave it another listen. Wow! I was blown away. There are no fewer than 5 great tracks, capped by the infectious 'Doin' You'. I agree with the previous reviewer, how did this group miss mainstream success?The only place I ever heard of The Connells (and this remains true to this day ) was a late-night MTV Video I recorded...that was enough to convince me to buy the album. You should too."
2,An Equal Voice to Each Side?,"I found this book to be biased toward the worst experiences. I couldn't finish reading it because some of the letters were so depressing. I did read about 80%. My feeling is the author received more ""worst experience"" letters because she received a greater response from those is support groups. I personally believe that one belongs to a support group because they are in distress and need others in their situation to offer support.It didn't change my mind about surgery BUT it did help me to come up with questions for my doctor."
4,This is a great book for beginners.,"I am 12 years old. I am reading this book and think it is just great. Get the Cd-book package. It teaches you how to make several different kinds of applications and programs. For each day you make one program.It is missing several lines of code, but you can figure them out. It teaches you to create things dealing with web browsers, paint programs, and much more."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this one,"The best word to describe this book is WEAK. I have muddled through this one and have been frustrated by the lack of clear example this selection contains. What little example that is provided is vague at best. I would give this title a negative rating if I could. This selection comes with an offering of the source code on CD that is supposedly used in this book. I wouldn't know because the the CD that was included with piece of work was damaged and the publisher's technical support department needed an absolute volume of information in order to even process my request to get a replacement CD. Once I complied, they responded with ""we're sorry but this title is out of print and we can't help you, but thank you for choosing Sams"". Thank you? Thank you for what? Good luck to you Sams, your technical support dept. has a long way to go."
1,Should not have been published in the first place!,"This book is intended for beginners, or so it seems - but it doesn't explain things with sufficient clarity. Examples are given sparingly. When they are offered, they are not explained thoroughly. So this book fails miserably as a beginners' text. By chapter 3 or 4, you'd be screaming for help.If this book is intended for more advanced users, it covers too much of beginners' stuff. It won't appeal to this group of users either.So for whom is this book written? I don't know. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,"Come on, what can I avoid?","It seems have a good start, but it losts me soon. It seems step by step, but leaves a few steps alone.It seems helpful with VC, but looks much like a C++ clone..."
2,Not that great,"Looks alright at the start but like others seem to have found, once you get to hour 8 it suddenly becomes unclear."
1,For Beginners - Yea Right...,Chapters 4 and up would be a good review for those very familiar with MFC and Visual C++ programming. For the beginners - good luck and think about the great dinner you could have had w/the money you just wasted...
5,Great intro to Visual C++ 6.,"I found this book to be a great introduction to Visual C++. You must have a basic understanding of C++ and OO to appreciate the book. I found it a quick way to jump into VC++, but it requires effort from the reader, the programming language is not handed to you on a platter, but that is how we learn best."
5,One of the best books on the battle,"Although published ""way back"" in 1974, Wiley Sword's Shiloh: Bloody April still proves to be one of the best books on the subject. The book proves to be well written and narrative of the battle provides interesting insights and perceptions. The book remains relatively unbias in nature. The author writes critically about leaders of both armies while understanding that sometimes, mistakes happens! The author provides good background material to the battle before and after.I am not sure what the previous reviewer wrote when complaining about lacks of maps. I thought 18 maps provided in the book was more then enough.This book belong in Civil War library of anyone who have such an interest."
3,how far can a student think of his teacher?,I think that this book is a comedy about a boy who wants his teacher to die when the school year biggins and he thinks thats good because they will miss school for problably a month or even more because all techers will go to her funeral and the students will have to stay home until a new teacher arrives
5,Great book,"This book was so funny, my son and I had a wonderful time reading it. I would read aloud, and could hear my husband in the next room laughing. It was great."
3,Better than average Trek,"Perhaps those who gave Imbalance only one star didn't stick around to finish it. It does start slowly, painfully slowly. However, it picks up soon and has some fine scenes. Riker, Worf, Keiko, and Crusher each find themselves alone and trapped on an alien world, with the former three in particular undergoing interesting, tension building adventures. In the end, the only major complaints to be had are a too petty O'Brien and a deus ex machina via transporter.There are no deep revelations or insights here, just a pleasant read with some fun images that will linger - like that of Riker becoming a human toboggan."
1,In the UK HELP,"Bought this toy in Times Square NY yesterday on holiday from UK. Despite telling them that they told me it simply needed batteries, and failed to point out that it had a rechargable plug in bit. With 240 V over here, even if we can get a plug adaptor this toy will not work for us. Very cross with staff for not pointing that out, and one very sad 9 year old having lovingly carried the toy home. Any suggestions anyone???"
1,Wont leave the ground -- bought 3 of them,"Bought three of these from the NYC store last week for my cousins. They all worked great for the first 2-3 minutes. After recharging, all spun but did not take off.Very cool idea, but an extremely bad product. I wonder how they made it work in the demo.Keep your receipts and the packaging."
1,Not worth the money.,"It's an intriguing concept...a hover copter you control by remote and can use to play games, do stunts, and race against other hover copters. But you can't really do any of that with this hover copter. The remote controller only allows you to control its speed....it doesn't allow you to control the direction of the hover copter. So it goes up and down without a problem or you can make it hover in mid-air at a slower speed...but as far as moving it left or right, it doesn't do that. I don't know what kinds of games or stunts you could do with it. A neat concept, but poor functionality overall, and the blade isn't the safest for any kid...at full speed, a hand in the plastic blade hurts quite a bit. I do not recommend this item at all."
3,Buy TDK instead,"For those who worry about the quality of Memorex DVD+Rs, buy TDK. I recently bought a 25-pack 4X and two 20-pack 4X TDK DVD+Rs. They are all made by Ricoh (based on DVD Identifier), and they are very good (no coasters so far). By the way, I had owned some Memorex CD-RW discs and they were bad too."
2,Once were wonderful,"...but as another reviewer pointed out, Memorex dumped Ricoh and went to CMC. The Ricoh discs had been top-shelf stuff, I only hope that I have enough of them left to hold me over until the dual-layer and 16x drives come out this summer!"
4,Not perfect but work for my combination,"I recently acquired a LiteOn 411S DVD+-R/+-RW. After reading a lot of reviews, I concluded that Memorex is one of the +R disks that should simply ""work"". I have backed up 3 DVD videos at 4X so far and no coasters. All play fine on my Toshiba SD-2805 and Sony PS2. But I have to say that the disks do look somewhat cheap. When you looke at the corners of the DVD, the plastic are just rugged.Buttom line, it works on my Liteon 411S. MAKE SURE YOU UPGRADE TO THE LATEST FIRMWARE!"
1,"Man, these were great media, and then...","I used to buy these all the time from Amazon, these Memorex discs were originally made by Richoh, which made top notch discs. Now, not so much. The original dozen or so spindles I bought back in the day got 5 stars with no problem, the new ones that Memorex sells, sadly, are junk. I'd stay away."
1,BAD Experience,I tried burning 4 DVDs. During the wirting process I got no errors and while playing (DVD player & computer) I see the scrambled picture and no audio. I'm going to return these.My DVD writer: HI-VAL/IO Magic Dual format (+-R/RW) Internal drive.Software Used: Nero Burning Room
5,Great foundation for today's confusion,"This book is an excellent compilation of the words of the prophets regarding a variety of topics important to our ongoing liberty. This book was recommended in the LDS General Conference by Ezra T Benson in April 1965. If you want a compilation of what the Prophets have said regarding liberty, this is a great primer and will give you the tools to discern between the many opinions in today's society."
2,Edelbrock Rear Shocks,"I purchased the front(33216) and rear(34216) sets for my 99 Ford F250 Super Duty. I have to admit to myself that I've had better at less of a price. The rear shocks seem to be ok. The front I'm not sure how to describe. The spring back is good for the big bumps, but they don't perform well for your average drive. I'm kind of regret buying and I am a bit disappointed. I would have thought better from Edelbrock."
3,Not made for Women!,"Look, for most guys or girls with big muscles, this works. However, if you don't have an arm that fits this description, it won't fit. Ladies, I advise you to buy something else. I sewed more velcro on and have a long tail sticking off of it. Which is really annoying. Thought I would put it out there."
5,A Collector's Classic,"This is Tyler & Jim's first ""boot book"" and it has turned more people into boot collectors and bootmakers than any other.I think it's because of the great personal stories it tells ...and the portrait Jim took of each maker. This book has the look and feel of a treasure map.Originally printed in 1992, it's remarkable that it's still in print. Get it while you can."
5,A must have!,"This is a must have CD for any Christian that likes R&B and some Hip Hop Rap. It is a great CD gift to give someone that is coming to the Lord so to help them transition themselves from secular music to Godly music that can strengthen their walk with Christ, especially for today's youth."
5,Tremendous Hellraiser Chapter!,"One thing I will say is that the longevity of the Hellraiser series is second to none in the horror genre. All the other long running series of horror flicks have become a distant reflection of what they once were. Hellraiser on the other hand has not succumbed to the recent trend of ridiculous sequels. Hellseeker is a great return of Kirsty, and the ending you will not believe. I sat there wondering wtf? And the brilliant ending tied it all together wonderfully. I would rate this right up there with 1 and 2, and as long as they keep churning out sequels of this caliber, I will buy every single damn Hellraiser movie that comes out. Oh yes and after you watch, whether it was your favorite Hellraiser or not, try to name a horror movie in the last few years that was better."
1,how many hellraiser movies is there??,None of the films are good they all suck. Bad acting bad special effects and only lots of pointless gore. Who needs like 10 movies with that??? only idiots who like violence in films. Avoid it at all costs.
3,This is Hellraiser.....again anew,"This story is mainly about betrayl. Though we've seen quite a bit about that in previous Hellraisers. Kirsty has a cameo appearnce in here. I just wish she was in there longer. Her husband is the main focus in this one, as you see him on a journey after a car accident with Kirsty.Apparently Kirsty is dead from the car wreck. But the police cannot find his wife. While he's being investigated by police, a lot of oddoties happen at his work place and his apartment. Some of the way people that he knew, treat him very differently than he thought previously before the accident.There are a few more Cynobite scenes than Inferno, which is basicaly the same amount of time they were in Hellraiser 1. I still didn't find this character as interesting as the one from Inferno, so I care a lot less about anyway that this guy can redeem himeslf in anyway. I wish Kristy was in the movie a little more, but with Pinhead being more of a punisher again it's closer to the 1st one."
4,The Dark Mystery Returns To This Franchise At Last.......,"This movie, like the previous entry in the series (Inferno), continues the series' return to form. Both movies loosely resemble the first two films rather than the middle two. For this, we should be utterly grateful. Hellraiser three and four were shameless ""bean counter"" flicks that ultimately disgraced this fine series. At first glance, Hellseeker to closely resembles Inferno. While it is true the plots are incredibly similar, make no mistake-Hellseeker is the better movie. Only by a small margin, though. While not completely up to par with the first two films, this is a good continuation of the Hellraiser mythos. I like the direction they are taking, going back to mindset that Pinhead is a major character, but not the basis of the movie itself. That's a major fault of the middle two films. Luckily, the last two have corrected this and have put the series back on track. All in all, another fine chapter in this ongoing series. Enjoy!"
1,Hotel Decadence DVD,I could not get this DVD to perform according to the movie. I would click on a option and nothing would happen. Save your money......
5,A bargain,"You get more than you pay for here, which isn't easy these days. I send these to my daughters by snail mail, but I could see them as art or periodic motivators too."
5,Great Single!,"This is a great single! Martina is growing and evolving into a one-of-a-kind! ""I Love You"" proves this so!"
3,Wish I had got the 8 inch,"It is realistic; but I didn't like the size. The vibration wasn't really that strong. Maybe next time, will order larger size."
1,no DVI listed wrong,"neither this model nor any 27"" samsung has a DVI port! A transcoder from DVI to componet jack is about $150.00."
2,Maxtor One Touch II Fried Like Other Users,"Like other users my 250GB One Touch II fried after not so much use. After reading many online reviews I realized there was no use contacting Maxtor. I found out several things on my own while trying to save the data. One, the drive inside the box is an ATA 133 hard drive formatted with NTFS. Two, the components that fried were not on the drive itself. Three, you can pick up a new board for the drive (if needed/fried) online if you look not-so-hard for a few bucks. I slapped the drive into my PC and was able to not only save the data but to reuse the hard drive."
4,Good backup drive,"Easy to install, as long as you do it exactly per the directions. If you don't, XP will complain to the point where the OS won't even start up! If that happens, just turn off the drive, de-install the software and start over.Great for backing up directories and individual files, and also great for full system backups - except that the backup software that ships with the product is Dantz Retrospect Backup V1, which gives you very very few options. To get a ""real"" backup system, you will need to upgrade to Dantz V7 (I paid $85 for it) but after doing that, incremental backups of full system data, and retrieving folders and files from those backups, has been (and is) a pleasure. It's so easy to backup, and it takes so little time (incremental), that there is no reason not to backup your entire system and all data every night."
1,Breaks after two weeks,"Mine stopped working after two weeks. Maxtor customer service doesn't help, either. First, the one-touch software stopped working, and now the whole package seems to have stopped working. I have reinstalled the drivers and software but to no avail at this time. I bought mine in spite of critical reviews, but this was a mistake.I will update this review if I can get it fixed, but for now a big thumbs down."
5,a legend to all who played it!!!!!!!!!!,alundra was one of the first ps1 games I played and I think it changed the way we think about adventure games forever. who would have thought that sutch a compexed colourfull game could be so perfect. many people I know & knew thought this games a game from heaven and it was...
1,Really Bad Historical Fiction,"Extremely detailed descriptions of people, places and things that are not very interesting. And by the way, this is NOT Science Fiction. It is historical fiction. And it is not very good historical fiction. The Hugo Award began its descent into irrelevancy with this selection and has since lost its credibility as the guarantor of great sci-fi."
5,Excellent,"I've been reading this book every year at Christmas since it first came out. I'm a huge fan of time travel fiction, but this book, combined with the human elements, and the lovely humour, is really everything I look for in a story. It completely engrosses me, each time I read it. And I find myself utterly moved, no matter that I already know what's going to happen. An amazingly touching, wonderful story."
5,"A very powerful book mixing history, humor and sci-fi.","I've been reading Connie Willis for a few years, mostly her wonderful, humorous short stories. When I finally read Doomsday Book, I was very impressed with her ability to develop her characters so that I cared. The book mixes some great middle-ages plague history, not normally a very interesting time, with some modern English time travel. The result is a most powerful novel. When I finished the book I was exhausted. I would definitely recommend it and list it on the top ten books I have read. It still haunts me."
5,Haunting and lyrical,"How do you gauge the success of a book... Try reading it years ago, packing it up in a box, stumbling across it unexpectedly years later, and recalling the haunting beauty of it immediately.Doomsday is not a standard novel. It does not fit into a standard genre, but it does tell a marvellous story that is moving, thought provoking, and ultimately truly memorable. The medieval people are particularly good - I agree with the reviewer who said that for once these were not 20th century people in fancy dress, but you really got a glimpse of how humans from a different time may have thought. What imagination and what a gift it is to read it!Not only is this a wonderful book, it improves on rereading. for a few dollars and you get a new way of looking at the world - what more could you ask for...read and enjoy,amf"
3,OK But Overrated,"I probably would have enjoyed this book more if it had not won the Hugo and Nebula awards. As it was, my expectations were far too high. The future characters are stupid and tend to pass out before they can reveal important information. This would have been a stronger book at 300 pages. The character development for the past was pretty good, but be ready for tragedy. Not the ""feel good"" book of the nineties."
1,First Impressions,"First impressions are so important. I'd seen this book on a list of Hugo winners and was looking for something new to read. If this is an good example of Willis' writing, I certainly won't be bothering to read anything else by her. Without going into too much detail, I'll just echo what some others have said: boring, repetitive and with many irrelevant details that did nothing to further the story line. How in the world did this win a Hugo??"
4,Doomsday Book,"This book is recommended for anyone who enjoys time travel books. I loved the time era that it takes you to, back to the 1300's during the Black Plague. It's entertaining as well as a learning experience. This is my second time of reading this book. Hope that it comes out on E-Reader soon!"
4,Longer than necessary but very interesting (& scary),I'd have to say that this is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. I felt like I was actually taking a trip back in time. The book was engrossing before it got creepy. I had a nightmare about catching the black plague the night after I finished the book. My entire family came down with the disease and it was horrifying. I was actually able to see the effects of the plague as it killed my family members as Connie Willis described in her book. Now I feel that I've had an actual experience of the past and not just from reading the book. Doomsday Book made me think about the aspects of human nature and how it plays into our history. I would have found the book even more interest had it not been so long. Connie Willis wasted a lot of time talking about things that are irrelevant (to me). I would have preferred a movie or the abridged version instead.
5,Heart wrenching!,"I had not read any of Willis' other books but discovered this one when doing a search for books about time travel. I found this book at once compelling and frustrating. It was written in 1992 and I am surprised that while Ms. Willis forsaw quite a few changes by 2048, she nevertheless has her one of the main character forever waiting around for the phone to ring. I kept wanting to say ""where is your cell phone?"".I genuinely cared about the characters and loved the bits of humor is a hugely tragic story."
2,A 600 Page Novella,"This book would be twice as good if it were half as long. Three times as good if it were a third as long. Some characters we can care about, some compelling conflicts and situations, some moments of lovely writing: all of these were ground to dust under the enormous tedium of words, words, words.My best guess is that this novel won major awards based on its brilliant perspective on the time paradox. Trying not to give too much away here - but by the end of the novel we see that Kivrin has spent her entire adventure working well within the strictures of the time paradox. In one brief moment, Kivrin even sees the paradox as a form of fate and even perhaps as a form of a benevolent god. And Ms Willis makes this point in ways that are smart, devastating, and deeply humane. But, good lord (pardon the pun), she took the long way around getting there. It wasn't worth the effort. This book is boring."
2,Over-rated,"This book won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, so obviously I'm in the minority in not liking it. When reading for pleasure I'm generally hoping for at least one of the four following things:1. A fast paced page turner that keeps me breathless with anticipation.2. New, interesting ideas or insights about people, society, or nature.3. A world of wonder. New places, people, beasts, magic, technology, etc.4. Masterful writing. An author with the ability to make me smile simply through their use of language.Great books give me three or four of the above. This book gave me none."
2,Great Concept But Falls Flat,"After reading all the wonderful recommendations for this book, I decided to give it a try. What a dissapointment! Granted, perhaps at the time this book was written, the idea was rather original but the author was so long-winded that it made it a frustrating read. The reader has to get to halfway through the book before the plot finally got interesting, but by that time, I found most of the characters so irritating that I skipped several pages at a time to get to the end of it!I would recommend you check this out from your local library before spending precious $$ on this book."
3,SciFi Time Travel,"I will say that I almost didn't keep reading the book after the first 50 pages. Getting to the time travel was excruciatingly boring and complicated....And it was done on purpose. Some smidgeon of interest would be sparked by the author, who would then change the chapter and emerge a new scene, leaving the reader to wait until later to find out what happened (TIME and TIME again).BUT, I must say that once the time travel actually got to medieval times, I was quite interested in the story. The characters were interesting and the depth of the author's research in medieval times was evident.I would recommend this book -- but only to those who have the patience to wait for the good parts."
2,Save your time,"Could Willis foreshadow a little more? The first 200 pages read something to the affect of ""does she have the black plague?"" I wonder what's wrong with her, she had been syptoms similar to the plague, yet it is unconclusive....and so on and so on...Willis's characters have little depth and a central character, Dunsworthy, is an enitre yawn. This story could have been told in 200 pages opposed to 600. Save your time and your money.Get Micheal Creatines 'Timeline' instead if you like sci-fi."
3,"Overlong and repetitious, but still worthwhile","This book would have been twice as good if it had been half as long. There is far too much repetition of the same points - as if Connie Willis had not done the five years of research she actually did and was forced to stretch a limited store of material.There - that's the bad news out of the way. Other reviewers have pointed out how unconvincing Willis' 21st Century Oxford is - and their points are valid - but this deficiency is counterbalanced by her description of life in the mediaeval village that Kivrin, the time-travelling student - finds herself in.The story rests on the two main characters and their response to the terrible circumstances they find themselves in, and here it comes up trumps, especially where it deals with Kivrin's courageous fight against an inexorable tide of disease and death. Recommended, then, but only if you have the patience not to throw the book at the wall at the nth repetition of the lavatory paper joke."
5,A fascinating tour de force,"One can know the numbers and even various details of the Black Death, but Connie Willis makes her reader feel it in personal, human terms. The book is a world (or two worlds, since it is half in the 21st century and half in the 14th) of its own which catches the reader so that you cannot let go until the last page. Willis breathes wonderful new life into the old SF trope, the time machine. Typical of Willis' stories, characters are constantly ensnared in a mass of little problems that make it almost impossible for them to deal with the big problems-- a crummy phone system, an absent administrator, fogged up glasses, etc. (today's readers will notice the notice the lack of cell phones, now ubiquitous in Britain as elsewhere, but not extant when Willis wrote the book). Willis' 14th century episodes have the virtues of the fine historical novel: meticulous accuracy in terms of what is known, plus vividly imagined characters and situations."
4,Excellent time travel adventure,"I love time travel books and this is a good one. It's beautifully written with characters that really come alive. It starts slow, however, and drags a bit in the middle, but sooner or later you will get totally hooked. My only complaint would be with the ending. Not to give anything away, but the book ends with a thud instead of a bang. I was expecting a time travel twist at the end, a subtle Rod Serling epilogue, but it never came. Despite those warnings, I would say don't miss it, it's a goodie."
4,Enjoyable but not without its problems.,"As others have already written, this book can often feel ""slow"" -- sometimes frustratingly so. Various hurdles are placed in the paths of our protagonists, and by the third or fourth time they've encountered such troubles they begin to wear on the reader.Once the book hits its stride, however, there's no stopping it, and the latter half is a truly enjoyable (not to mention often emotional) run. Time travel is used as a device to enhance characterization and progress the story, not particularly as an in-depth look at the potential science behind it, so don't expect a ""techy"" novel. This is character-driven storytelling, and many of the characters are endearing, and easy to connect with. If by the end you are not feeling for Kivrin and cheering Mr. Dunworthy on, then you may, in fact, be without a soul. The trick is getting to ""the good stuff"" and slogging it through some of the less enjoyable chapters earlier on."
3,As advertised,"Three main features of this book have been mentioned in a large number of the reviews on Amazon: (1) The story is interesting, and at times moving, especially the parts set in the time of the Black Death. (2) The world of 2054 is very poorly drawn, missing even such things as cell phones, and really looking like the 1970s + time travel. (3) The editing is awful, with tremendous amounts of duplication and padding.Having just finished the book, I can confidently assert that all three comments/criticisms are spot on. This is a pretty good book, which would have been a very good book with a more imaginative future England, and a great book if it had both had the more imaginative future, and been 250 pages shorter."
2,This won the Hugo and Nebula?,"As science fiction, this is a terrible book. As historical fiction, it's serviceable. However, this book's plot is paper thin, its characters are cardboard, and its extremely UN-exciting. The book drags on forever with no direction. I recommend other Hugo and Nebula winners, but stay away from this one, unless you want the history of the Black Death pounded into you over and over..."
2,A slow ride,"This is quite different from most science fiction. Unfortunately, it did not work for me. The author emphasizes dialogue and developing characters at the expense of plot or action. Nothing really happens. We go back and forth between a health crisis in the 21st century and one in the 14th century, where people keep dying and the characters cannot do much to affect it, so we are forced to endure their grim fate along with them. For those who prefer characterization to action, this book may be enjoyable, but to someone like me (who admittedly tilts to escapist space opera when reading science fiction) it was simply a slow-moving story about dealing with death."
2,How did this win the Hugo and Nebula?,"The mental movie running in my mind while reading this was produced by the BBC in the 70's; the characters uninteresting and cliched, the colors washed out and the picture grainy. Am I becoming bitter and cynical about awards? Are they now given to the works that are the least imaginative and most user-friendly? If I find any answers I will probably also discover how Braveheart won an Oscar and the blandest top 40'ish musical groups win Grammies. Hugo and Nebula award winners are are not necessarily the vanguard of the genre, but they are usually sure bets for good reading. Read something that did not win an award for that year"
2,dooms day really is doom,"sorry to say ,i cant see why half people rate this a ten and others rate this low , the story as i see had potentail and some interesting aspects ,like the relationship between kirvin and agnes ,but in the end the two story lines never crossed in time ,or should i say the people in the 20th century never made it time to help kirvin , perhaps if connie really merged the two storylines sooner --more story could have come about .kirvin should have interacted more with colin -more to save something in this novel , who wants to read a book with rich charecters only to find in the end they all die helplessly ,if this is anyones cup of tea drink it Well my friend :-("
3,Original story,"Original story, well written, but SLOW. The plot suffers from the absences of all the advancements in communication and science that have occurred since it was written in 1996, ,but,ignoring those issues, it's really entertaining. The characters are also very likeable."
3,"Fun story, but frightening future","The story is great, but the vision of our future is so sad in that the people are motivated by self interest totally lacking in intelligence, logic, and common sense. Impulsivity drives all action. In the future, I would like to think we have developed a greater sense of working together on common goals for the greater good."
1,Yawn.,"This book proves the case that some reads are far better abridged, than unabridged. Repetitious, boring, tedious, rambling and, did I mention, repetitious and rambling? In the end, too many unanswered questions to situations mentioned over and over in the book, but never explained. Also, time travel can be a tricky thing, but at the very end of the book, the use of a ""locator"" has to be the icing on the cake. They didn't have satellites back in 1348 to my knowledge. Two stars would be too generous."
1,"Good sound, very poor quality.","My first set after a fair amount of use gave up. Because the sound quality and sound isolation is good I bought a second set. After very little use they quit working. They can't be fixed, even by the manufacturer, and the warranty is useless. Replacing the filters is also a hassle and expensive. Not recommended when there are so many other choices out there. I feel like I wasted $80.00."
4,"Great Sound, Finicky Fit","When I first put these in after I listened to the new iPod phones I was horribly disappointed! Where was the great sound I had paid for? What I had was tinny and terrible. I went back to the reviews I had looked at and read them anew. I had overlooked the part about making sure that you had a proper fit. I had also disregarded the manual's own warning to the same effect. The standard cushions did not fit my ear well so the sound was absolute crap. After I changed the cushions, the sound was every bit as lovely as all the reviews claim it should be."
2,Poor bass.,"This is my first Etymotic. I have 2 others in ear headphones that , for me , sounds better than this ER6i, one is a Creative that came with my Zen X-Fi and other is a Razer M100. Was sincerely expecting more from this specialy considering the price..."
5,Great once you get used to them.,"These earphones are everything I was looking for. I should preface my praise by saying that you must wiggle the earphones deep into your ear before you really experience these earphones at their best. Once you get them deep in your ear you will hear crystal clear sound reproduction, with notible bass tones. As far as isolation is concerned, I can listen to music with my earphones in my car with another song on the car stereo playing at full volume, and not hear any sound at all from the car stereo. One reviewer said he moved his lawn without hearing the lawn mower. I believe it.A great product for someone who wants high quality sound but doesn't want to pay 200-300 dollars for sure headphones."
3,People looking for any bass - move on. Otherwise keep reading.,"I was super excited to give these earbuds a try per many stellar reviews from different websites. I tested these out on my iPod and my computer with many different EQ settings to try to find some happiness. --- this is what I found.PROS:-SUPERB Isolation-EXCELLENT Clarity (you will hear things you never heard and sometimes do not want to hear!)-The ear plug although looks like it will kill your ear, is actually fairly pleasant. It will take some practice to get the right fit and placement (deep) into the ear, but once there you're good.CONS:-Bass. Bass. Bass. These things offer almost 0 bass. If you push them to far they get extremely distorted on the low end.And that is the reason they were returned. If you a fan of little bass these are definitely worth checking out. However for the majority of normal listeners the stock iPod headphones will offer more balanced sound than these...but NO WHERE NEAR the clarity of these."
3,Disappointing,"I tried all the ear pieces but found the sound underwhelming with all of them. Base was rather weak; listening to Bach organ music the pedal notes were very weak. The sound was not noticeably better than the in-ear phones that came with my Sony-Ericsson W810i, in fact the base was a bit stronger with these. From the reviews I was expecting more, though I know that no earphone will reproduce the full body experience of listening to the organ live in York Cathedral. I returned them, finding that my relatively inexpensive over the ear phones are more satisfying."
2,"good sound, VERY flimsy wire",I live in nyc so I am constantly doing something with my IPod - the problems that I noticed in the 30 minutes that it took me to get from JR to my apt I noticed these problems:The input plug goes straight in so it can catch on anything in your pocket;The wires feel very fragile;The soft case has a small zip open at the top so I guess you are supposed to carefully wind them then carefully place them in the case - that just doesn't happen in a busy city.Requests to improve product - place plug at right angle;Stronger wires and a HARD case that is easy to use on the fly.
2,Stopped working after a month!,"The iPod earbuds do not fit my ears at all, so I was looking forward to receiving my ER6i's for the airtight fit and comfortable looking earpieces. The flanged ends never worked for me at all -- I constantly felt like I had a head cold and could hear more inner ear pressurization noise than music. I primarily use my iPod at the gym and every time I'd bend over to pick up a weight, my ears would pop. Not fun.The foam tips are much better, but I was still uncomfortable with the seal (but willing to live with it). I don't actually have to worry about it any longer, because as of this morning, the left one just quit working. I played with the wires, switched buds, tested the iPod, etc. So, as soon as I got home from the gym, I returned them.For this kind of money, I want a pair of ear buds that feel good and last until I'm ready to try something new. Very dissappointing. :-("
2,Very Disappointing,"I ordered these for my Ipod (as, I'd assume most people who order these do). I was looking forward to more detailed sound reproduction and extended, better controlled bass. Well, as soon as I put these in my ears and fired them up (and yes, I was sure to follow the istructions to the letter about ear insertion, etc.) I was incredibly disappointed. Overall a very ""thin"" sound...screetchy sounding with almost no bass. I thought it was my imagination so I reinserted them in my ears and played through another 3-4 songs. Nothing changed. The only plus I could see was that they fit more comfortably in the ear than the stock earbuds which don't really fit snuggly and always feel as if they're about to fall out.Sonically these things are just awful. I returned them the next day. Save your money."
3,High end sound,Sounds great but hard to get used to deep insertion. Don't plan on hearing too much outside noise in fact pretty much cuts out the whole world. Would be good if you did running or activities that other buds would fall out. Cord does get tangled in the pocket but no big deal. If you want to up grade your sound on your Ipod this is the way to go.
5,Great little buds,"I've had a pair of these little wonders for a while now, and must say they deliver as promised. The sound quality is good, if not great, and the noise canceling feature helps tremendously. The cords are a bit thin, but even with the abuse from pulling my full face motorcycle helmet on and off over them, they lasted over 2 years. Recently one side stopped working, I replaced the filter, but that wasn't it. I can't see any damage to the cord but I expect my usage stressed the cord too much, and a connection was broken.I've wasted a lot of money on cheaper, ""throw away"" Wally world specials to get mashed up underneath my helmet since then, but can't find any that are small enough to fit, and/or still stay in place while I'm riding, let alone sound good on top of it.I will be buying another pair of these ER6i's, and will probably add some epoxy (or something) to the cords where they exit the bud, to try to provide some extra support."
4,"Great sound, but ...","About 5-6 years ago, I purchased a similar product from Etymotics. Although the wires were a bit fragile (I got warranty repair once), the sound and sound-isolation was so good that it made up for the deficiency. Then, I purchased an iPhone and of course the headphone jack wouldn't seat properly. That's a well-known fact about (at least first-generation) iPhones. So imagine my surprise when I get this new model and the jack STILL doesn't fit into my iPhone! I just purchased an adapter, but that's a pain. I've purchased earbuds from other manufacturers recently, and they fit my iPhone just fine. Why not the ER6i?"
1,Poor Value,"I hope that I can get a refund. These ear buds have almost no bass response. Very tinny sounding. I tried everything; different flange tips, adjusting the fit, even adjusting the eq on the iPod. Nothing worked. I compared the sound of these to two other ear buds and they sounded less than half as good but were twice the price. I had to stop using them because the sound was so irritating. Those engineers love their fancy-pants graphs but they must not test these things on human ears."
1,Shoddy construction,"I've had these earphones less than 5 months and I had to return them today. The clip snapped off about a month ago, and then a few days ago the earphone cable-cover slipped out of the plug housing, exposing the raw wires.Oh, and another real annoyance -- though not one that would've made me return them -- was that the buds don't attach firmly to their mounts, so after a while, when I'd pull the earphones out of my ears, one or the other of the buds would remain jammed in an ear. I had to keep a pair of tweezers in my locker, in case this happened while I was at the gym.I bought the equivalent pair of Etymotic's 5-6 years ago, and they were MUCH better quality back then. (None of the three problems I described occurred, they're obviously not making them as well as they used to.)"
5,FANTASTIC sound quality & human factors design! Brilliant!,"Excellent sound, fit, function, and myriad choices for ear bud tip is absolutely amazing. These people are totally squared-away. Everything I have purchased from them has been on-time (usually ahead of promised delivery date - both via Amazon or direct), and they just deliver excellence.You cannot go wrong with Etymotic ear buds. Extreme excellence in sound for a very reasonable price.Bravo Zulu, Etymotic!Tim"
4,LOVE EM,"these are the best for me. I use them on runs and in the gym. This blocks out traffic and noise so I can hear what I am listening to. They are also great on planes and double as earplugs and people repellent. I would also recommend as a musicians' in-ear monitor. They're that good.My only gripe is that the wire is far worse than the drivers/ plugs. The wire will wear out, and the maker will tell you that they're not repairable. I know this is not true, because I put the drivers on a different wire with a wire splicer and a soldering iron. that's one good use for the earbuds that came with my ipod."
3,Noise-reduction earphones,"The earphone quality is mediocre - the sound is a bit tinny; to improve it, the earphones need to be completely immersed in the ear, which can be a bit unconfortable. However, when fully in the ear, the outside sound is almost fully suppressed."
2,tin can alley,"The reviews here sound so wonderful, if only the earphones matched!I simply don't get what everyone else is talking about. These are just wretched; clear, I suppose, but no bass at all. (zero!)I much prefer the originals that came with the iPod. Buy 4 of those instead.They were a gift at christmas and so the return window timed out. Thtat's a whole LOT of cash to be wasting.2.5 stars for sound quality, 1 for service."
3,Etymotic Research ER6i tested....,"I purchased the ER 6i's to wear on a recent motorcycle trip and on short Saturday morning rides. I'm aware of the damage extended exposure to the decibel levels experienced while riding that can occur and want to avoid it with full plugs rather than ear buds. These plugs, while effective at diminishing ambient noise to a safe level, give only a partial spectrum of frequencies found in music. That which is missing, is the bass. Many tunes with bass solos, seem absolutely quiet during the solos. it's like it isn't on the track. Listening to these plugs while on an airline flight is adequate. Therefore, high ambient noise levels experienced while motorcycling (and probably other noisy activities) seem to over tax the ER's ability to reveal a full musical spectrum."
5,"Subway commuting, excellent customer service","I've owned a pair of these er6i's for the past 10 months. I've been very pleased- Great sound, excellent isolation. I dont get to work tired from the subway noise.2 weeks ago, I noticed that the right channel was working intermittently - something was loose near the 1/8"" plug end. I contacted etymotic, they had me send the phones back for a warranty repair. 5 days later, I had a brand new pair waiting for me in the mail. Confidence in their product? You bet!"
3,"Sounds great, comfortable... brittle and fragile","I got these a few years ago and was initially very happy with them. I was coming over to them from a pair of Shure e3cs that had given up the ghost. In both cases I used the foam ear buds to ensure a tight seal, good noise suppression, and a good fit. The ER6i foam buds fit very well and were very comfortable.The sound was likewise excellent.One problem is that the wires are exceedingly thin. This makes them get very stiff in the cold, and one of the earbuds stopped working within a span of probably 3 months. Customer service could do nothing for me, so my headphones are now in the trash.Be wary of these - maybe these would be much more durable than a place like Maine, but just as a point of comparison, the Shures these replaced had lasted longer than 2 years in the same environment. Again, the biggest difference I saw between them was a much thicker wire in the Shure's case."
4,"Sounds great--cord ""Clingy""","I have now used this product for about a month. I really like the quality of the sound, and I always use the cover it came with to store them, but the type of rubber used in the cord is sort of ""Clingy"" and can ""Stick"" to itself.I like the clip that is on the cord and if you roll the cord and clip it in a spool, that helps. Also the colors for the left and right are almost invisible.I would give this product a 5 if the cord was on a yo-yo."
2,sound good but be careful,"I have had these for about six months, once they are seated correctly the sound quality is phenomenal. Outside noise is isolated as good as it can be for an in-ear model, bass is clear and distinct, mids are there, highs aren't too brightBe careful with how far in you put them. In order to get the best sound they need to go in FAR. The problem is if you have larger ear canals, and they go in too far, the rubber tip can become stuck in your ear canal. In my case the seal was too tight and when I removed the earbud by pulling on it (not the wire) the rubber tip was still lodged in my ear canal. I had to go to the hospital and have it removed by a specialist!"
2,Good sound but lousy construction!,"I had these less than a month, and while happy with the sound, they constantly, like other reviewers, forced my Ipod into pause mode. Also the right headphones gave out completely due to a short in the jack. Less than a month! Come on!"
4,Quality ER6i Isolator Earphones are in the ears of the beholder,"The ER6i earphones gave clear separation of the high notes & pitches so that I was able to enjoy a few of my cd's; for me, though, I really prefer being able to hear a fuller and deeper bass, something that I felt lacking in the ER6i. They did a good job cancelling out outside noise."
2,Generally Disapponting,"I was expecting great things from this set of rather expensive earphones.Their high end performance is quite good.The bass performance is somewhere between very bad to non-exitant even when adding equalizer boost,STAY AWAY FROM THIS MODEL!!"
4,fabulous separation,My husband is hard of hearing and has issues with most earphones. He could not get over the quality of sound and separation. External noise is also significantly reduced.
2,"Clean mids and highs, but no bass","If you like the sound of good quality bookshelf speakers - with the woofers removed - you'll love the ER6i's. There's a whole ritual involved in getting them inserted correctly (the casual observer might think you're having a seizure) and even the slightest difference in the way they're inserted causes significant changes in the sound, which goes from thin to thinner. Etymotic claims audiophile pleasing accuracy, but I don't consider it accurate when you completely chop off the whole lower end of the audio spectrum.The wires russling against your clothing cause an distractingly loud noise in your ears as well.I bought the Ultimate Ears SuperFi 5 earphones a few weeks after giving up on the Etymotics and, even though the price of the UE's is somewhat higher, the quality and extended range of their sound (full, deep, balanced bass, warm mids and clean highs) made it well worth it to me."
1,Dissappointed,"These earphones were a dissappointment. I did my research on earphones and read that these earphones would be a great replacement for the ones that come with the iPod. I found they lacked bass and mids. I only heard the highs. I liked the fact they had earbuds that fit snugly in your ear. This was supposed to help block out all the surrounding noise, giving you a cleaner experience. The iPod earphones sounded better. Who knows they may have been defective for all I know, either way I wouldn't buy them again."
2,No bass(unless you shove them into your hypothalamus),"Seriously. I had to shove these little things so far into my ear to get any sort of bass response out of them that I thought I would lose them. Fortunately the wires held and I was able to get them out. Despite the vertigo after removing them, they worked great as Q-Tips. I've decided to return them as I don't need a $70 pair of Q-Tips."
5,Incredible Sound and True Bass,"Etymotic Research ER6 Isolator Earphones (Black)I originally bought a pair for myself a year ago. They were so wonderful that I bought them for a friend. His reaction was the same as mine, ""Wow"" listen to all the music I was missing!It is VERY important to follow the instructions to insert them fully; and it takes some practice (at least with the foam tips, which I prefer) to get them inserted just right. And when you do, everything but the music disappears.Great product that lives up to its advertising promise. I use them with an IPod Nano"
1,ER6i Earphones for i pod,"I bought a pair of these a few weeks ago to replace the pair I purchased a year ago and they are not the same. Last years earphones were great, better comfort, super audio quality, I use them with a i pod nano for motorcycling and running, The new ones are terrible in comparison. A little less comfortable (there is a difference in the quality of the rubber tips) and the sound on the new replacement pair is what I would expect from a pair of $10.00 earbuds from Wallmart. No low frequency sound like the old pair had. I just wish I would have checked for some reviews before buying the replacements, but thought I was buying the same product as the year before and I was wrong. I would send these back but I waited to long to try them out."
3,Nothing special,"When i first recieved these headphones i was quite excited, these were my first pair of headphones over 30$ so I looking forward to testing them out. Most of the times i used them was at the gym working out, I found the noise isolation to be very effective and made it possible to really get into the music...Although the noise isolation is the source of the headphones biggest downfall which is the discomfort they cause while wearing them. To get the full effect of the noise isolation you have to push the earbud deep into you ear which causes serious discomfort after a very short time. Then you take them out to find the are all bunged up with earwax, gross. I also found over time that the volume gradually died.After using them for about six months i shelfed them and instead used my 30$ philips i got at walmart..."
3,"NOT for exercising, HORRIBLE customer service!!!","I bought these from Amazon in April, 2009. I used them for jogging and exercising in general. Working out 3-4x a week they lasted until Jan. 2010. Wow. GREAT quality there. Oh, and the kicker? I emailed Ety to get a warranty return and was told they wouldn't honor their warranty. Nice, huh? For this price I expected Ety to at least take care of their paying customers. Needless to say I'm not stopping at Amazon.com with my story. The email I got from Patsy at Ety listed a ton of exclusions to their warranty return policy...none of which are on the website when you are researching for an order. The website makes it seem like they'll warranty the product from an authorized reseller (amazon) for 1 year. So I was sold. I guess I should say I was TAKEN. ETY will NOT get my money again. They are a good product but the after-sale-service is what makes the Internet so frustrating, no help at all. BUYER BEWARE!!J"
2,Prepare to buy another pair after a year,My pair of etymotic stopped functioning after 13 months. Coincidentally Etymotics warranty period is for 1 year after purchase....Why is this the case when companies such as Monster provide a 3 year warranty? I contacted Etymotic hoping they would at least repair my earphones and they suggested I buy a new pair...I'm not going to buy another pair and I am staying away from Etymotic.
3,Etymotic Research ER6i earphones,I purchased these due to dissatisfaction with std ipod earphones - reviewed ilounge and these were highly recommended. I am very happy with sound quality and fitment comfort - but lead is too long ~ 50 inches - difficult to store
3,Not bad...,"These earphones are work great for noise isolation and are definitely better than the standard iPod buds. That said, the lack of bass response isn't quite what I expected for a set of $80 earphones. In hindsight, I should have purchased the V-Moda in-ear buds."
3,Great sound but they didn't last long,"Purchased the headphones in December 2009. Used on weekdays during commutes to/from work. By June 2010, the connection between the wire and the ear bud was split / fraying. There is a 90 day warranty, but unfortunately the damage was not noticeable until after the warranty expired. Too expensive for six months of use."
3,Nice noise-cancelling feature,"I bought it to replace my iPod earphone. the bass is very weak but the main feature, noise cancelling, is adequate. since they go quite deep in the ears, need to pay special attentions to keep both earphone tips clean."
4,It's Great...,I got it one month ago. It's great....Sound was clear and base was quite acceptable....I felt it was so worthy to buy it.
4,good in-ear earphones,"Nice sound.... only draw back is their tiny size... which makes for a good fit, but you need to avoid the temptation to pull them out by the wire. Always grab the speaker part. But great sound, light weight."
3,Crystal Clear - Limited Bass Response,"The ER6i's are very small and light. There is plenty of length to the earphone cords and there are four different types of bud adapters to use to try to get a tight and comfortable seal. Unfortunately, even pressing them into your head so far that it feels like they are going to touch, the bass response is very limited. They are super clear and the highs are sharp and crisp. But, the limited bass is a serious drawback."
2,Flimsy wires result in product failure,"These are decent from an audio perspective and have very good passive noise reduction. Unfortunately, they do not stand up to normal wear and tear so I simply cannot recommend them (unless you can be incredibly careful in your use of them). After about 8 months of regular use, the left earphone started going in and out, requiring me to fiddle with the wire position to get sound in both ears. By 9 months, both earphones were doing this, rendering the product effectively useless. I attribute the problem primarily to flimsy wires, which are significantly thinner in diameter than any other earphones that I've owned in the past. I think the act of taking them out of my pocket and/or bag over time just wore the wire connection to the jack out. I've contacted ER customer service about the issue and I assume they will honor their warrantee (which is one year, so mine are still covered). I will update the review if/when I get a resolution."
4,etymotic headphones,"Good product. Bass isn't as skull-rattling as I'd like, but the overall sound is great. They are excellent at blocking out ambient noise, they'd work great as earplugs if you needed them to."
1,"Small in size, small in sound.","I wanted to use these earphones to replace the uncomfortable ones that came with my iPod. I was so disappointed with how the ER6i earphones sounded that I returned them. ""Small"" is the best way to describe it. Little or no bass at all and a very ""pinched"" mid range. One look at the responce curve tells the whole story...there is simply very little bass that comes out of these, only an overly pronounced midrange. These things just sound...bad."
2,Was hoping for better...,"The reviews I read prior to purchasing the earphones gave me the impression that the product was of exceptional quality. However, my experience was less than satisfactory. The quality and volume level was very inconsistent. Without adjusting the volume controls, the volume would range from loud to soft for no apparent reason."
2,Way bright,"Bought this a few weeks ago on the advice of a friend to replace the stock ipod earphones which frayed on me (literally).These earphones are quite overated. My main objection is that they are extremely bright --any audiophile reading this will know what I mean by this term. If you are listen to and like the sound of tube gear, this earphone is definitely not for you. I can't stand more than a few minutes of it at a time without turning the volume way down--it sounds like someone put the treble on maximum permanently. Tremendous inherent distortion. I read with amusement some of the reviews here where the reviewers laud this earphone for 'clarity'. No accounting for taste, I guess."
4,Awesome,"These are the best in ear headphones you can buy under 200 dollars. Scratch that, the best head phones you can buy under 200 bones. Great for sound, noise isolation, and activity such and working out and running. They stay in place and for me are quite comfortable. This is my 2nd pair since I lost my first ones. My first pair were 150 dollars and I thought they were worth every penny, so obviously I think these are great. Only the Bose QC2's get more stars."
4,GOOD JOB OF DOCUMENTING MICK'S HOMERS,"MR. NUTTALL DOES A FINE JOB OF DESCRIBING IN DETAIL MANY OF THE MICK'S HOMERS AMD OTHER BIG HITS IN HIS CAREER. THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR ALL MICK AND FANS OF MONSTER HOMERUNS. MICKEY HIT MANY, MANY ""TAPE MEASURE"" SHOTS. THIS BOOK IS VERY INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING. KUDOS FOR THE RESEARCH AND EFFORT IN THIS MUST READ. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,Hangtime ALL THe WAY,Hangtime is by far the greatest game in N64 history. I play it night and day. Nonstop. This game has amazing technology. And great gameplay. This game is at its best deal for $$$ bucks. I bought a whole truck load.
2,get NBA Jam TE instead,"Like it or not, NBA Hang Time is basically NBA Jam with a new name. And NBA Jam TE is actually better. Get NBA Jam TE instead."
3,My least favorite of the series so far,"I'm a big fan of Kinsey Millhone but this is my least favorite book of the series so far. The mystery is interesting and it took a while to figure out but Kinsey's attitude through the whole book was disturbing. She seems very contemptuous of anyone with physical disabilities, a family, any religious feelings or anyone that's out of shape. Her rude comments about people in these categories really distract from the story and I'm guessing that a lot of her readers fall in at least one of these categories. The cast of characters are not very likeable either.I'll keep reading the series because they are well-written, interesting mysteries but I'm hoping for better things from ""G."""
1,F is for Fugitive,I gave this book only a one star becouseit would not play. I bouhgt it in theCD format and found it would not play
4,A No-Nonsense Novel Which Stays on Target,"Ms. Grafton's 6th Kinsey Millhone novel is her typical fast read. The book wastes no time on unnecessary dialogue. 32 year old PI Millhone is a very well developed character by this time. There is no mid-story lull and nearly no time spent on her personal trials & tribulations. That part of her has been been developed & is not addressed in this book.She finds herself in a very small town in California. Hired by a man's dying father she's needed to find & prove his son is not guilty of a seventeen year old murder of a promiscuous young girl.Kinsey finds herself in a community surrounded by some people who are quite strange in their own right. Some readers have figured out the protagonist, I'm one who didn't. Not until close to the ending. It's a very good read, as are Sue Grafton's other alphabet books. Better read in series, they can be read out of order. I actually started with ""S"" & ""T"", then went back to the beginning"
2,Biased,I do not think this gives a unbiased opinion of the true beliefs of the Mormons. It would seem to be one sided.
1,Some people need to grow up.,"I do not agree or believe in Mormonism myself, but this book is total and utter immaturity. It is like Jack Chick's badly-drawn anti-Catholic propaganda, only prettier looking.PEOPLE, LIVE AND LET LIVE. So WHAT if Mormons believe what they do? They can believe God is the Easter Bunny for all I care! As long as they aren't hurting anyone, what does it matter? If you all claim to be TRUE followers of Christ, then go and do what he commanded: be kind, loving, charitable and so forth. NOT sit around and write hate literature and make yourselves richer by demeaning people whose only crime is having different views from you."
2,"Not sharp, and rusted quickly","I was so excited about this knife because it looked like it would serve as an all-purpose knife, and the fact that it was pink really helped. I usually love the KitchenAid branded items so it was promising. The knife was pretty dull. I had to 'saw' a lot with it. It rusted quite a bit within the first two weeks that I had to end up throwing it out which was very sad. Definitely not worth purchasing."
5,Great game,Probably the best over head shooter for its time (overhead not side/etc) for it's time. With amazing effects you wouldn't really expect for PSOne that still look pretty good today. It's pretty hard and an awesome challenge
4,"mostly acoustic, unique bootleg","This is one of the more unique bootlegs that PJ has put out. It is a mostly acoustic set, with some plugged in guitar for solo purposes. Being an acoustic set, the set list is a little different than the setlists on the regular tour bootleg series. Definitely a good performance. Some interesting covers including a Johnny Cash song. I would mostly recommend this to true PJ fans, or anyone who enjoys just good musicianship."
2,Don't waste your money,"This feeder seems to be well made and really sticks securely to the window. However, only two birds at a time can eat from it. I bought good seed to attract cardinals and other colorful song birds. For several days, no birds came at all. Nothing but some kind of brown birds ever came around and then only lit on it and flew off without eating."
4,A real help to us!,"We used these connectors with our two umbrella strollers at Disney World. It was a godsend! We were able to split up and each take a child or if one adult went somewhere, the other could still push the two strollers.They are easy to take apart and pack nicely."
5,It works for doubles too!,"I have an infant in-home daycare and needed a quad stoller for my four babies. When I first found these connectors, no one could tell me if they would connect two tandem double strollers together. I asked every store in town almost (some didn't even know what they were!). I just decided to buy them and hoped that they would work. So I went out and bought two Kolcraft Lil' Limo strollers, not knowing, of course, if it would work or not. I'm happy to say that they seem to work really well! I did have to buy a second set, though, so I have five connectors on mine(couldn't find room for the sixth one). Just lock the two inner front wheels so they can't turn and you're off! It is a little hard to turn corners(just take them at a wide angle), but otherwise it works great! I ended up spending just under [price] for the total cost of it, much less buying an actual quad stroller. I hope this info will be helpful to someone else also. Good luck!"
3,What you pay for is what you get,"I actually saw this product at Babies R' Us and purchased it for $10. I figured I have nothing to loose by spending $10 for the convenience and option of creating a double stroller if needed since I'm expecting baby #2 in the fall. I own 2 Maclaren umbrella strollers (the Quest and Volo). This product fit well on both the strollers. HOWEVER, when the strollers are connected they are VERY wide and would not fit through my apartment door. I checked out a few double strollers and they tend to be both heavy and bulky. And if you're like me and own a small sedan then fitting in 2 small umbrella strollers in the trunk is a lot less stressful and cheaper. I think it's great for running errands in large stores or malls with wide entrances and using it locally. But if someone plans to do a lot of walking as exercise in the park or just walking around on a daily basis then I'd probably say go with the double stroller."
4,Excellent Product for mom with twins,"This is a life saver for a spare set of umbrella strollers I keep in my car. When I am out by myself, I keep these in the car, and I have a double stroller when needed. Great product, and much more inexpensive than a double umbrella stroller."
1,This product is a sham.,"I don't know how this has as good of reviews as it does because it was a total disaster. Going over a bump in the sidewalk or making a simple turn and the connectors popped off. The rubber pads also fell out--one wasn't even in place when I took it out of the package. Hard to explain if you haven't seen the product, but basically if one connector came off there were up to 6 parts to collect. And this wasn't an occasional event. We walked one block and one connector fell off. We turned around then and by the time we were almost back the other two had come off as well so I ended up leaving one kid and walking them back individually. It took a lot of carefulness over each bump and they still fell off. Plus it required both hands at all times when pushing. Waste of money. Waste of time. Big disappointment. I'm not usually one to write reviews but this was bad enough I felt the need to warn others. This doesn't work!!!"
3,Life Expectency: About 2 Years,"I bought this for my son about 2 years ago. It definately is the most comfortable booster you'll find, but over time the foam will split and break off. My son's booster has two huge chunks missing on each side just from normal every day use. Like another person stated in their post, it is still functional, but very unattractive if you leave it sitting on chair at all times like we do. The advantages are comfort, light weight (for portability), so easy to clean, and stays put on chair without straps. Like others, I too have some minor damage to the finish of my wood chairs, but all in all, I think I will purchase another one for my daughter. We are about to retire her highchair. Dispite the wear over time, I still think it's the best available."
5,Great Booster,We love it and most important our 2 yr old loves sitting in it. Soft and comfy. A must have!!!
3,Good but not perfect,"I have purchased three of these in the past and am now about to purchase my fourth. I am buying it because it is the best thing on the market for toddlers to preschoolers who aren't quite big enough to reach the kitchen table yet. It is comfortable, sits securely on the chair and is about the right height for kids 18-24 months and up.That being said, it does have a few flaws. The first is that the sides tend to break and rip causing a big mess (and an ugly booster) over time. It's still functional, but rather unsightly. I'm buying a new one now simply because I can't stand looking at it any more.The second flaw is that the foam used seems to react with the finish of my wooden kitchen chairs. Over time it has stripped the finish off all the areas that it sits on. For that reason, I would not recommend it for frequent use on fine wooden furniture..."
4,good purchase for toddler,"I really like this booster seat. It works well for my two year old. She's comfortable in it, it doesn't slide off or scratch the chair. Very easy to clean as well. The only downfall that I can see is that there is nothing keeping her in the seat (no strap), so she gets up when she wants to, rather than when I want her to!"
2,didn't last long,"I purchased this booster initially because of the positive reviews and the fact that it looked so comfortable. It also was in one piece without any cracks or crevices for food to hide. However, at 8 months, it has fallen apart. I realize it is only foam, but I would think it would hold up a little better for $30.00 purchase price. There have to be other better ones out there."
3,"Comfortable, but...","Between the two of us my sister and I have purchased 4 of these. We both have wood chairs and haven't had any problems with the finish. However, the material seems to dry out a bit and eventually the sides will fall off in large chunks (happened with all of ours). They're still functional but not real attractive. They are definitely the most comfortable boosters for the kids we have found. Not very durable, however the missing sides don't seem to bother the kids any."
3,It ruined my chair,"I bought this booster after owning one of the hard plastic types that strap on to your chair. That type caused scratches and nicks in my chairs. I figured this one would be great because it was soft. My son loves it, and it's easy to get in and out of, but it has ruined my chair! I have solid oak chairs, and this seat has caused the finish on my chair to ""melt"" somehow. I'm not sure if there is heat created when sitting on it, or how it has happened exactly, but the finish on my chair looks terrible. I will have to buy seat covers for my chair after I'm finished using this booster.This cusion does not slip at all, and my 4 year old has enjoyed sitting in it for over a year now. It has held up, without any damage or signs of wear and tear. It wipes clean very easily, and it's very portable.I think it's a great booster, except for the fact that the suction has ruined the finish of my wooden chairs....."
4,My boys love it!,"Love this booster! We've had ours since it was first introducted in the stores in 2003; it is still in great condition and expect it to last as long as my boys need to use it (and possibably more). It works great with our corner knook table (we even take it in it's handy case when we eat out), but don't recommend its use on the bench or on a seat without a backing. We had to buy a second to keep my 2 and 3 year old from fighting over who was going to sit in it during meals."
1,Very Boring,this film has-been done already countless times.you would think with Denzel Washington The Best Actor of his Time&Angelina Jolie the Hottest Name Going Around Right now that there would be Something More Interesting? think again one big Formula Copy-Cat Film.
4,A Credit To Jeffery Deaver's Book - It Did Not Disappoint,"I saw this movie in the UK shortly after release, and was immediately compulsed to go out and buy the book. While I consider the book to be a thousand times better, there are good reasons for this - firstly, the book contains a lot of description and the way in which the NYPD forensics team worked, which would not have worked in film - and I enjoyed it immensely.This has a classic double-double-whammy ending. With a great cast and script, this was surely deserving of an Oscar nomination, which, unfortunately, was not forthcoming.I would not advise everyone to watch it. It shows the element of the unsub's - The Bone Collector's - work in graphic detail. Great movie, but most definietly not for the faint of heart."
5,Awesome!,"The Bone Collector was one of the greatest movies I've seen this year. It's suspenseful and full of action and surprises. The cast was fabulous! Queen Latifah, Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie were awesome. One of Angelina's best movies! Denzel and the rest of the cast made this movie a great movie! Awesome movie, a Must see!"
2,"Great performances from Washington, O'Neill, and Latifah . . . and that's about it","This movie could have been so much better, but they just had to ruin it, didn't they? With the exception of very fine performances from Denzel Washington, Ed O'Neill, and Queen Latifah, the rest of the film just falls flat. The plot seems so ridiculous that I can't help but look away. Angelina Jolie's acting is below average, but she did her best. The twist ending wasn't very disappointing, but it did fall flat because of its exaggerated (or lack of) suspense. I didn't really enjoy watching this thriller. There are better ones like Se7en, and The Usual Suspects. Watch those two, and you'll see how a real thriller should be.Grade: D+"
1,Ridiculously Non-Believable,"This movie is just so tragically non-believable, that it irritates the viewer and you have to quit on it.Good cast, but what stupidity in the script. Are they serious letting us believe that a serial killer is re-enacting crimes from an almost 100-year old novel.And so Angelina Jolie goes to a decades abandoned meatpacking storehouse and can still smell the manure??????Duhhh --- the place has been abandoned for decades. More non-believably, you mean to tell me a real estate developer hasn't snatched up the property and razed the building. That it has sat undisturbed so that even the manure is intact decades later?I'm sorry -- when movies use plot devices so amateursishly like this, I bail on the whole project."
2,NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED,"This movie was not what we expected. It had great actors, and an okay story line, but not scary at all, which was oh-so-disappionting to me and my husband. We were hoping it was as good as the previews."
2,"SORRY.. .THIS ""THRILLER"" backfired...","It's a shame. This thriller is so unconvincing that you end not believing that Washington is in it. THe plot is a shame, nobody even gets a little bit scared. THere is a coward attempt to mislead the public to believe that every character may be the killer. IN the end, the ridiculous cliche scene that shows the killer ready to kill the heroe, but then our female heroe (Jolie) appears out of the blue delivering fatal shots into the grotesqly stylized villain. Sad.."
2,Dissappointed,"I expected quite much more when I rented this film... First of all, I found Angelina Jolie isn't anything more than another Catherine Zeta-Jones! No significant acting, face solid as a rock. Even Denzel Washington acted more and better than she did! The story was very common, and the clue-gathering rather boring. And of course, the ending reminded me of about a gazillion other movies, where the bad guy gets killed before he can kill the good guy, by the good guy's partner! In all, very dissapointing!"
3,The Bone Collector,I thought it was an interesting approach to a thriller. Denzel Washington portrays a paralyzed ex-cop who helps catch a serial killer from his bed. Angelina Jolie plays a rookie cop who follows his directions to find clues to the killer's identity. There was really nothing unexpected in this film but it's a decent thriller.
4,Fit just right.,This was bought for our truck camper and works great. Price is not a great deal but it is the going rate none the less.
3,Functional Yet Confusing,"The basket works well and it is spacious enough; however, Wald provides so many screws/nuts/bolts but no instructions, I put it on and it's secure, but I do have extra parts left over? Did I install it right, I may never know...."
3,it's a bike basket,"I got this to replace a rear-rack-milk-crate assembly. My original ""basket"" weighed 4 lbs, and I measured the Wald 18"" Basket at 6 lbs. I did notice the weight difference, but quickly got used to it.As another reviewer mentioned, my feet sometimes hit the basket. I remounted the basket higher and further back - as high and far as it could go on my bike. My feet still hit the basket occasionally, but it is workable.The basket worked with my tire mount points, but I had to create my own attachment method under my seat. Working with some longer screws, rubber tape, and flexible connector I got a very secure and rattle-free attachment.I've only had it for a few months, and it seems like a reliable piece of bike hardware."
4,Where's the clamp?,"This basket looks super cool on my 21 speed bike and I plan to put it to much use. However, when I received the package order I noticed the metal clamp which connects the basket to the bike frame was missing. No, problem. I went to the bike shop and they supplied me with one free of charge when they mounted my basket onto my bike. It would have been nice to have gotten the one that normally comes with the basket though. Thus, 4 stars."
5,Made-for-video movie has all the works of a mystery movie,"Made-for-video mystery flick is outstanding. You never know who the murderer is until the very end. Alicia Silverstone is HOT! The best made-for-video flick I've seen so far. I saw this movie two summers ago on USA and kinda liked it. I saw it the second time and felt that it was an awesome mystery movie. I'd reccomend this for everybody who likes a good mystery movie. Some may like it and some may not. Outstanding acting and original storyline works like something came out of a ""Nancy Drew"" mystery novel.Suspensful and plenty of action."
2,Stop not so FAST!,"First of all as a big Alicia Silverstone fan, I thought she played horrible.For Kevin Dillon he looks like a mutant and he cannot act.Second,the theme was very good but the way they put it made it ""not-watchable"".Alicia Silverstone deffinetely wasn't the beautiful girl in Clueless .I did not appreciate that also.Therefore, I do not recommend you to buy this movie."
5,Head Like A Hole!,This has the original song and remixes. It is a classic because it is one of the first CD's made by NIN.
3,Not a complete disappointment...,"I'm keeping this one short and to the point. I find alot of the HLAH remixes to sound somewhat similar, but there's enough variety to make this a pretty good cd, yet you won't want to listen to it all the way through or over and over without getting bored.The Terrible Lie remixes are also fairly good, but I think I still like the PHM version better.The Down In It remixes are good as well, yet they could be found on Halo 1. I wish they remixed Ringfinger or Sanctified instead.The Down In It demo is pretty cool, and interesting.Besides that, there's not much else for me to say. If you like HLAH, get it. If not...think about it, listen to some samples first."
4,One of the best NIN songs,Head like a hole in my opinion is one of the best NIN songs that was heard in mainstream music radio and with a whole bunch of different versions in the CD it makes it impossible to not hear them all and like them all....
2,Not what i expected,One CD with several variations of the same song. I only like one version of the CD. Would be better of to purchase the one song as a MP3 from I Tunes.
2,Be aware,This is a good looking shoe. But be aware that it's not made of leather. My son wore it for a few days and his feet were always sweaty and started peeling very bad.
5,Mase is definantly BACKKKK,Mase has really come back in this album all his songs are great..about 5 or 6 of the songs were really good and/or standed out... but all the songs were great...dere was about 3 songs that had his old Ma$e in him thats the good part overall i would give this album 5 stars Welcome Back Ma$e
3,My Man Is Back!!!!,Im so glad that Ma$e put out a new cd. I've missed him soooo much. I like pretty much all the songs. The beats are REAL good!!!
3,NEW BEATS,MASE U NEED NEW BEATS...TAKE A LESSON FROM AFROMAN. BUCKAW. JOIN THE STREETTEAM ON HIS WEBSITE. NEW DISC OUT NOV 2
3,Okay,after i heard Welcome Back i thaught this album was gonna be OFF da CHAIN. but sadly its just okay. some songs are HOTTTT. but others are BORING. if like mase get this. if uve only heard Welcome Back and like it then get a single or downlaod it.Hot Tracks:Welcome BackBreath Streatch Shake (F/P.Diddy)Keep It OnMoney Comes and GoesDo You Remember (F/Cardan)
5,A MA$E FAN,"Dont expect the old Ma$e!! He's back and getting love from airplay. From Much to MTV to BET to Radio, its whatever. The songs are radio friendly. I went to the store and this thing is selling very well. His lyrics are real and for everyone. I think this might hit platinium(1 Million million records sold). PICK UP THIS ALBUM TODAY!!!!!"
2,Just ain't the same,"His flow is undoubtly as grand as it was back in '96. However, the hooks and the chorus for each song are poor at best(except for Tracks 1 and 2). I don't want to hear Mase singing period. His adlibs are awful. He tries to adlib like P.Diddy and it's just bad. As for the lyrics...how many times is he going to rhyme to ""it's hot?"" Bring back the old mase and puffy team!"
3,Not that great,I was never a Ma$e fan but I bought this cd to see what his comeback would be like. I liked Welcome Back the song so I figured I'd give it a try. The cd isn't bad but it's nothing great. It doesn't make my ears bleed to listen to it so that's a plus. It's just not about much. I thought he would have more to talk about. He talks alot about how much money he has and that's about it. I thought someone so richly blessed by God could have a few more topics. I suggest listening to a friends copy but don't buy unless you are a die hard Ma$e fan.
2,"Interesting, but not all that I had expected.","In reading this novel it comes across as more about the Merrimack and some about the Monitor. It seemed that the author was sympathetic to the South and anti North. Even more so, it seemed to be anti Lincoln in that over and over again Lincoln was referred to in various deragatory manners by people of the south as presented by the author. I came away with the feeling that the author was presenting the South as noble and in a favorable light while the North in a less than favorable light in that they were usurping the free men of the South the right to keep people in slavery. Furthermore, the wife on one Southern naval officer being held by the North is raped by another Southern naval officer and totally gets away with this. Maybe there is another book that will follow that will redress this incident, but I do not think I will waste my time."
1,Expected More,"The story is excellent. When I buy a book for my shelf, I expect quality. This appeared to be public domain open-source material plopped into a cover. Spelling errors, typographical errors, and lack of punctuation throughout. The closing quote on the back cover is actually translated differently than inside the book. Seemed like a free ebook product with a cover."
4,An Examination of a Soul.,"An excellent, soulful book in the vein of The Trial, and Crime and Punishment. Vladimir Nabokov sums my views of this Novella quite well.In his lectures on Russian Literature Russian born Novelist and critic Vladimir Nabokov argues that, for Tolstoy, a sinful life is (such as Ivan's was), moral death. Therefore death, the return of the soul to God is, for Tolstoy, moral life . To quote Nabokov: ""The Tolstoyan formula is: Ivan lived a bad life and since the bad life is nothing but the death of the soul, then Ivan lived a living death; and since beyond death is God's living light, then Ivan died into a new life- Life with a capital L.""(Nabokov, Vladimir Vladimirovich: Lectures On Russain Literature pg.237: Harcourt Edition)"
5,Very Fascinating,"I was fairly young when I first read the Death of Ivan Ilyich, and the man's story fascinated me. It is a book in itself, not a siderunner to Tolstoy's enormous (and more than a little tedious) and more famous works such as War and Peace. The way Ivan Ilyich's thoughts swing from hopeful to despondent is interesting and reflects fundamental human psychology. Tolstoy is indeed a great author."
3,A man who life is meaningless dies.,"A magistrate becomes sick after hurting himself while hanging curtains. The mans life has no meaning nor value and no one cares that his is dying. Those around him jockey for his position or concern themselves with securing a larger pension. A short book, perhaps three hours long. Tolstoy's books are engrossing because the reader sees himself in one of the characters. I look at Ivan Ilyich and see nothing of myself in him and so it is difficult to appreciate the death of a worthless person."
4,Crazy Leo at it again,I believe this book was one of the greatest books dealing with death and one's ability to cope with it ever written by anyone.
1,"Great story but don't buy this version (typos, etc)",I love the story but agree with the other reviewers that this version seems to be some strange open-access version created with autocorrect and plopped between two covers. Typos and lack of periods make the book hard to read and distract from the reading experience (they make you want to laugh in exasperation instead of getting immersed in the story). I was swayed by the cheap price but wish I had gotten a copy from the library instead.
3,A good Universal serial from the forties.,"Adventures of Smilin' Jack is that rarity of rarities--a good forties Universal serial. Along with Gang Busters (also 1942) this represents Universal's best serial effort for the 1940-46 time period. A thoughtful script that helps convey a good action-adventure romp; minimal use of stock shots; good musical background that relates to the action going on; and good casting bolster this serial considerably. Rose Hobart is very good as a coldly efficient and ruthless Axis agent. Also very good is the ultra suave, Turhan Bey as her Japanese counterpart. And Tom Brown is well cast as the hero. Oh sure, it's Rover Boy stuff but its well done and very entertaining. If you collect serials this will be a very nice addition."
3,"very sweet, but lacks excitement and plot complexity","I loved Jacquie's last few books (the dialogue, characters, wit, and plot development) and was surprised when this book was all sweetness and everything was 1 dimensional. Then I realized that this is a republication of a book written back in 2000? because I 'm reading reviews for this book from 2000. Whew!This was not a bad book. The hero is a real hunk and the heroine is nice. It's about 2 people who were not expecting to fall in love, but do, instantaneously. Guy pursues girl, but girl was burned by an ex-fiance and has trust issues. Sorry, but I lost interest in several parts of this book since there was no plot twist. I would say, go read her recent Historical romances which are much better."
4,Sweet love story,I always enjoy Jacquie D'Alessandro as an author. I am a big fan of her period pieces. I was interested to see how I would like a contemporary fiction of hers and was not disappointed. It was a sweet love story and just what I was in the mood for.
2,not what I had hoped for,"I purchased this after buying the artist's album of Elton John music, which I found great background music. I was looking for something in the same vein, but found this distracting and unenjoyable to listen to."
5,Dreams Come True,This teaches little ones that if you follow your passion dreams can come true. Lovely story.
4,A must own for any loyal Barsuk lover,"I am a loyal patron of the Barsuk label, and this album is truly one of my current faves. It is a little Death Cab mixed with a hint of Goo Goo Dolls. Best song by far on the album is of course ""Always Love."" For anyone who is considering purchasing this album I do recommend it. However, if you are not really into mellow indie then it may not be for you."
4,Pure Pop Pleasure,"Not as familiar w/ their older stuff, but am enjoying this album a lot. I tip my hat to anyone who can craft songs as musically interesting and catchy as these. 'The Weight is a Gift' is the perfect antedote to the misanthropic blues."
1,Not worth the money,I didn't realize that the pack has only four pieces .. it is not mentioned anywhere. It is not worth the money.
2,"Soft and effective, but didn't last long","They don't seem to stick very well. Also, once they did start to come off, I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table."
3,"Nice looking, OK in effectiveness","These are nice jumbo corners that didn't make our table look too hideous, but at some point your baby's going to learn to pull them off! This didn't happen for us for a while and I really think any other brands would have the same problem, so this one's the best in the market. My daughter fell and hit her face on the corner guard and her mouth still bled, though the damage would have been much worse without the corner guard. It's definitely better to have these than nothing at all."
2,"Eh, not so much...","We put these on our entertainment center and figured it would keep our nine month old safe from hitting her head. Surprise, she figured out how to pull them off the second day. They have turned into a chew toy. Although, the adhesive stuck well to the entertainment center, sadly, not to the corners."
4,"great product, not true grey",This is a wonderful product. Advertized as the color grey ... but is actually taupe (brown/grey)or tan. I wish it came in true grey.
1,Not worth the money,"We installed the corner protectors on our coffee table when my daughter was 7 months old. She didn't pay attention to them for a few weeks. Then she realized that she could peel them off in no time. We no longer have the corner protectors on our coffee table because it has become a ""game"" to pull them off. She more likely to fall and hit her head while pulling them off the table."
2,"Sticky, not what I expected","I was eager to try the Olay Definity line. I had gotten a free sample in the mail of their cream and it was wonderful.However, when I got the Foaming Moisturizer (it comes out like shaving cream does), it has a different texture. It feels sticky after you put it on. Then later when I am putting on my makeup, in places it looks like my skin is peeling because it leaves a residue that when brushed with powder, kind of comes off like peeling skin. Yukk! I am NOT going to buy any more that's for sure. I looked for just the regular cream version at Walgreens and they don't have it. I hope they still make it - it was the best."
1,NV does not work.,Three fourths of the way through the bottle and absolutely nothing is happening. I have not lost one pound yet and don't feel a thing. May as well be taking sugar pills.
2,Didnt do much for me,I have been taking NV for a few weeks now. I have noticed a decrease in my appetite. So much so that the people around me are noticing i eat less. As far as weight loss - nothing! So i have to say i am a little frustrated but maybe this just wasn't the product for me.
2,Not Impressed,"If you really need to buy a duty belt or accessories, you really only have two options:1. Spend a lot of money for Safariland, Gould & Goodrich, etc. At least the quality is top-notch, if overpriced.2. Go for the lower-end, like Galls, Uncle Mike's. The quality is much, much lower.You'd think that a high-end supplier like Bianchi could make a lower-priced line without sacrificing too much quality.Wrong..The new ""Patroltek"" line is very, very low end. No polymer stiffener inside, the belt itself is weak and overly limp.Caveat Emptor....."
3,Telephoto lens for Canon A540,"It doesn't change the magnification nearly enough to be worth the cost. It's a good quality lens, but the inconvenience of the size of it and the lack of adequate magnification make it not worth the cost."
5,Total Woman,I read and used the principals in this book when it was first published YEARS ago! My son is 26 now and at the time he was only 2..the book is really good and if you use the guidelines (based on the Bible) you not only are a total woman but you make your man feel like a TOTAL Man! I try to buy every copy I can find to give to younger friends or newly wed friends! Really good book! If you liked this one try the second one Total Joy....
1,Christian???,"Marabel Morgan assumes that a marriage can be ""turned around"" with the effort of only one person-this is false. No relationship relies of the efforts of just one person-two people must be actively involved. The fact that Mrs. Morgan portrays this book as Christian is false as well. Since when did Jesus ever tell a person to reduce themselves to mere sex kittens (not to mention lying to your husband about his sex appeal!). Mrs. Morgan reduces men to helpless, pathetic victims who should be manipulted. I wasn't aware that manipulation and lying are Christian virtues. Mrs. Morgan needs to give a little more credit to both genders and more importantly to the institution of marriage itself."
4,The Untold Story .......,"The author has created a much reveered book of the much covered, but not completely truthfully told, 1906 event.Almost as soon as the dust began to settle, the facts were ""ammended"" to create a more publicly acceptable slant on the day: The number of people killed is still contested today, over 100 years since the event. The author puts forward her view, ably supported, as to why the figures of the day were inaccurate, and the effects that had.Great book, one I'd recommend."
1,disappointing,"I thought since this was ""custom fit"" I would be satisfied. After about a month of daily use in the vehicle they started to bunch up and have become more trouble than they are worth. I felt like they were a total waste of money."
3,Never used a camera? Buy this book.,"This book seems to be aimed at people who only get their cameras out on the weekends for trips to the beach or major events...people who hardly use their cameras. If you're in this position and want to know how to get good shots of your kids school plays and things like that, this is a good book for you."
3,Be Aware - This Book Is For Point and Shoot Cameras Only!,"I have recently purchased an SLR camera, which can be a somewhat complicated device. I purchased this book to get some hints on making the most of this camera. However, this book does not address SLR cameras at all and is designed for people who use point and shoot cameras. The author states in his introduction that he wrote this book for this type of camera because very few books address point and shoots and that these cameras outnumber SLRs by a large margin. I skimmed through the rest of the book before I returned it and found that it does appear to hit all aspects on how to more effectively use your point and shoot camera."
2,used once,"I don't know if this brand it effective against fleas since my cat keeps scratching and it is hard to see fleas on black cat. The one thing I hate about this product that my cat licks himself after being powdered, and then vomits the powder. When I tried to powder his bed, he refused to sleep in it. Generally, the product smells nice, and it is natural, but I don't have much use of it."
5,The best compact flashlight I've ever used,"I am absolutely enthralled with this flashlight. I went camping a couple of years ago with this guy buried in my bookbag as a last resort emergency light (I had gotten it for free along with a Swiss pocket knife I'd purchased). After realizing that the Coleman MicroPacker lantern was absolutely useless, and upon recognizing that my old flashlight was fairly dim, I panicked and pulled this guy out in hopes of a miracle. And, of course, it delivered in spades. This is the brightest beam I've been able to find on a budget, and it cuts through the dark like a hot blade cuts through butter.On my annual camping trip the next season, my girlfriend, remembering how awesome this light was on our previous trip, never let this light out of her grip. It's the choice of champions, and I will never be without it again."
4,Nifty Little Package That Travels Well,"I am very happy with this printer. It's put together well, is light, has a light detachable battery and separate inks for color and black and white. It also looks pretty cool!"
2,Shipping is a Killer.,"Shipping a little steep, you may as well get this at Staples to save yourself. I hate that when online dealers give a really cheap item, then profit so much off of ""handling"" charges."
2,"What A Deal ""BABY""","As I said ""What A Deal"". Not only does this printer get those resumes out quickly, but it is also a super chick magnet. I place this beauty on the seat of my 1989 Yugo subcompact chick mobile and BOY they come running. It just screams "" I Know How To Treat A Lady ""."
3,Too expensive,"The product works very well and prints very clearly, but at $50 million, it's a little bit too overpriced."
5,Love this seat!!,"I love to take my Chihuahua with me on my days off. He is my lil' companion! He used to sit on the seat next to me, he couldn't see anything and because the seat slopes back, it was only comfortable for him to lay down. I bought this Snoozer seat. I bought the medium because I wanted him to have the option of sitting or laying. This is the perfect size for that. He weighs 16.2 lbs, so he is a big Chihuahua! This seat is sturdy, it is just the right height for seeing out and it stays put! I love this seat, it was a worthy purchase!!!"
5,Love it!,My dog lives it! Both in the car and she sleeps in it every night. I bought a dog bed that she would never use but for some reason she took right to the car seat as a bed!
5,Great Buy,"I bought this for my two pomchis. One of them especially,, always had car sickness and anxiety. Once they were able to sit together, high up to look out the window they travel much better and haven't gotten sick in the car since. It's a sturdy product. I bring it in the house for them when not using in the car, and they love to sleep and play on it. Would def recommend it! The strap clamps are a little clumsy to open would be my only complaint."
2,Disappointing,"I have loved this musical for so long, and was so horrifically disappointed to find out I had missed its release in theatres. So, I rented it. SO MUCH was changed from what made the musical so amazing and vulnerable. If you had seen the musical, I can't see how you would consider this anything akin to it apart from ""similar"", and if you haven't seen the musical, I'm not sure you would fully understand what the hell was going on.Big fat no on this one."
1,BORING.........,"I was SO BORED during this movie!!! I thought with the spectacular cast there would be no chance of that, but I was sure wrong. I was BORED, BORED, BORED."
3,"OK for fans of ""8"" and the music on CD","I have the OBC Raul Julia and the 2003 Revival Jane Krakowski recordings, but have never see ""Nine"" on stage, so I can not compare the movie to the play. I prefer the 2 disc Raul Julia Recording, although I like Jane Krakowski very much. I liked the movie but think it would be [more?] confusing if one hadn't seen Fellini's ""8""."
3,The soundtrack is much better than the film.,"I just rented this video over the weekend and fell absolutely head-over-heels in LOVE... with the music. The movie was only so-so for me, but the soundtrack is mesmorizing. I immediately went out and purchased the music CD and its all I've been listening to for the last couple of days. Who knew that the likes of Kate Hudson, Fergie and Marion Cotillard had such great pipes!"
1,Minus Nine,"Well, lighting did not strike twice with Rob Marshall's direction of the screen adaptation of""Nine."" Yes, ""Chicago"" was an immensely great achievement. Was it luck? That is arguable. Anyway, what we have here is a bastardized version of the brilliant stage show. Yes, the screen is a completely different medium and adjustments have to be made. However 3/4 of the wonderful Maury Yeston score is gone and the addeded numbers are atrocious. Without going into morbid detail, I believe when you have a piece that is so theatrical, transfering to the screen is a losing battle. The thrill of ""Nine"" on the stage was Tommy Tune's masterful direction and choreography and the perfect cast. The plot took a back seat. In the screen version, most are miscast and use of star power obviously did not work. The most beautiful song in the show, ""Unusual Way"" is destroyed by Nicole Kidman. The film is a mess from beginning to end and my guess is Rob Marshall's reign as a film director is over."
2,No bubbles in this champagne,"This film reminds me of an old saying: ""a triumph of never-mind over doesn't matter."" A very unmusical musical - there is literally not a single memorable song in its 2 hour running time - this film wastes the considerable talents of its all-star cast (best is Marion Cotillard, who generates considerable warmth in an otherwise cold, synthetic film) with a story so indifferent and a leading man so completely devoid of sympathy or interest, I was reduced to fast-forwarding my way through the second hour, which I almost never do. There wasn't even any good dancing to rouse interest, as it was all done in chop-chop MTV style - very disturbing in a musical that boasts a director who is a Tony-nominated choreographer. I'm glad I was dissuaded from paying to see this in the theaters last winter - I would've been forced to regard it in an even more negative light. *1/2 out of *****"
2,Cinematic Dullsville,"""Nine"" features an impressive star-studded cast with all the technical elements up to par. So why is director Rob Marshall's rendering of the overrated Broadway hit astonishingly dull? Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that Fellini's ""8"" does not lend itself to musical treatment. The songs and characterizations remain stunningly forgettable. Kate Hudson's ""Cinema Italiano"" number, in particular, looks like a self-contained music video that belongs on MTV. Oscar winners Daniel Day-Lewis, Judi Dench, Penélope Cruz and Marion Cotillard valiantly attempt to breathe life into a lifeless story. In stark contrast, Nicole Kidman, Fergie and the eternally glamorous Sophia Loren are badly misused in glorified cameos. Judging by the spectacular box-office failure, it's easy to see why moviegoers stayed away in droves."
2,You don't need it-- it's on something else!,"I'm not giving this two stars because the music is bad. Quite the contrary, this is wonderful stuff. However, one mix is the same as the album, and the other two are on the American version of the Head Like a Hole single. And you want HLAH. You NEED HLAH, if you're a fan of the good ol' days when NIN were THE groundbreaking rock and roll band. So forget this, and immediately go get that."
3,The beginning,"Halo 1; the beginning. Released before ""Pretty Hate Machine"", this single contains three versions of ""Down in It"". The first track: ""Down in It (Skin)"" is actually the song found on ""Pretty Hate Machine"", while ""Down in It (Shred)"" and ""Down in It (Singe)"" can both be found on the ""Head Like a Hole"" CD single. All in all, if you own ""Pretty Hate Machine"" and the ""Head Like a Hole"" CD single, you already own this disc, and you should only pick this up if your a Halo collector (and you all know who you are)."
3,Not enough,"This album is pretty much a collector's item for those of you fans that want to own all of the Halos. Your money would be better spent on Halo Three (the 10 track domestic ""Head Like a Hole"" Maxi-Single) that includes all the tracks from this album. Interestingly enough I actually like the demo of ""Down In It"" to the finished product."
3,It Sticks and Protects But !!!,"I will keep it simple and direct. This product is easy to installand sticks well without adhesive. The problem with this product aswith similar products, is that where the protector, which is clear, comes in contact with the LCD you lose clarity. No matter how you clean the LCD the result is the same. I have a Canon Powershot S50 that I'm trying to protect without that film appearing at the contact point. I don't know if I'm allowed to suggest another product but I have ordered a product that has a small frame around the protector so that the protector doesn't touch the LCD screen. (...)"
5,An important book appreciated!,"Tom Wolfe's Painted Word is an important book! People should be reading it in college. I was delighted with the copy that I purchased. It came to me, swiftly and in good condition! Thank you so much!"
4,"""You need a theory to understand Modern Art...""","He's not just joking around.He's got some point which we can realize that it's true !!Joking is just the way he represent his idea, he's not a fool !"
5,Pure Black Metal,"If you're a fan of true Black Metal, than this is a band you should know of by not, and if you haven't heard of them you should really do your research on the genre.Not Saved is my favorite mood setting song. Perfect to have playing in the background while strolling through a snow covered forest/park."
1,Awful Product!!!,"This suit gave me a bad rash around my neck. It looked like a hickie. It didn't go away for about two weeks. When it healed it scarred my neck. If that's not enough, water seeps in through the seams of the suit and in from the zipper in the back. I eventually got a better suit that was twice as expensive and I love it. As the old adage says, you get what you pay for. I encourage anyone looking around for a wetsuit to really consider how important it is that a product (that you spent hard earned money on) does what it is supposed to do, in this case protect me from the elements. Instead I had to protect myself from it."
3,Dudu Nobre Ao Vivo,"Lively record, but a lot of the songs sound the same, with call-and-response choruses. A nice samba sound, however, suitable for mornings when you want something peppy to get you up."
5,Comfort,"This book should be read by anyone whatever the personal situation is. It helps particularly when you are about to loose or if you have lost a loved one.We know nothing about death and we are never prepared to face it. Reading this book gives comfort, helps to ease the pain, and also teaches us to respect and honour all the living as well as the importance of living fully and consciously the time we have."
2,It breaks if you put a book on it,"It works well for paper, but I put a 5 pound book on it, and the weak plastic bit that holds it up in the back immediately broke in half."
5,better than it looks,I thought it was going to be one of those flimsy license frames but it was made of metal and thick...worth the price because unlike those plastic ones it won't crack
5,You will find the kernels,"I think a book is great if it gives me at least one kernel of truth - one piece of advice that I can carry with me, perhaps for decades to come. Few books actually do that. But this one does. It, in fact, gives a couple of them. And here is the thing: you are almost guranteed to find at least a couple of kernels yourself. The stories in this book cover a range of issues, some of them will speak directly to you.An excellent book!"
2,Freezes When Watching Brand New DVD's and Blu Rays,"I bought this Blu Ray player last November. It has always had problems freezing while watching a movie, even if the disc is clean or brand new. This problem has steadily gotten worse over the last year. After the latest firmware upgrade the picture would not only freeze, but would also scramble the picture."
5,Great Network Blu Ray player!,"I bought this mainly to receive Netflix movies, but it is a great player for Blu Ray as well as standard definbition DVDs. It is mated with a 50"" Samsung plasma and I am very happy with both products."
4,Works easy with Samsung TV,Installation was great. worked find out of the box with Netflix. Hardest thing was running the internet cable. BlueRay movies are unbelievable.
1,Did you know ?,Hey Blue Ray shoppers.Please be aware that this Blue Ray will not play a lot of dvd's (1/4 of my collection) . After I bought my first Blue Ray disc I found out that I need to update it and I need to wait 7-14 business days before Samsung will send me the disc.Costumer support was horrible and mostly useless.Most of electronics I own are high end Samsung but looks like I will be considering all other brands after this expierience.
1,regret ever buying a samsung blueray player,"We have had nothing but problems with samsung blueray player. Slow load times, very poor connectiving issues such as when using Netflix(and we have ultra high speed cable Internet service running with a high quality CISCO router). We updated the software for the player and it still won't play many blueray movies such as Rise of planet of the apes, it will not even play some regular DVDs such as Van Helsing. I really regret buying it. I will not purchase any samsung products again."
1,Worked Great.... for a year.,"Had this blu ray player for a little over a year. It was hooked up to my router through an ethernet cable and everything worked great. I was able to stream netflix and pandora with no problem, until a few days ago...For no apparent reason it stopped connecting to the internet, giving me a ""Ping Gateway error"". I am pretty tech savvy and have tried every type of troubleshooting available with no luck. I have read quite a few similar complaints about this unit and have wasted many hours trying to fix it. I finally gave up and invested in a PS3 for my blu ray and streaming.Whether I ever get this thing working properly again or not, no device should be this difficult to manage."
2,Rebuffering...,"Decent player, but a major flaw in what should be it's nicest feature: Netflix streaming. We've been trying to watch a TV series using Netflix on this device, but every episode stops to 'rebuffer' about four minutes from the end. At this point the player freezes up, and can only be recovered by a hard restart. I've done some research, and the problem is something with the player's software. I've tried numerous workarounds, but everything just leaves me screaming at my Samsung device at the climax of the episode.In short, I would NOT recommend this device to ANYONE!!!"
3,OK except for one flaw,"Everything was OK except for one flaw which I consider rather glaring. It does not restart where you left off if you turn it off in the middle of a movie. You better make sure to write down the chapter and scene or you'll have to do some hunting to get back to where you left off. Hopefully, Samsung will come out with a firmware upgrade to address this issue. The only other minor issue is the amount of noise the heads make when a disc is first inserted. It's a lot noisier then my old DVD player but once the movie gets going it quiets down."
1,Poor picture quality,"Removed from box and connected to my Samsung HDTV using an HDMI input. I noticed during the setup that the picture was flashing intermittently. After updating the firmware, I tried playing a DVD. Picture quality was poor (not sharp and somewhat jittery). The intermittent flashes continued during DVD playback.I reconnected my old DVD HDTV 1080i player and tested with the same DVD and everything was fine. I'm writing this review and sending this Samsung DVD player back to Amazon."
3,"Really? ""Wi-Fi Ready"".......?","Okay...I really like this Blu-ray, but the product says ""Wi-Fi Ready"" as if it were...well, wi-fi ready. That's only partially correct. I'm afraid I didn't know this when the salesperson pitched the product to me. So, after trying for about 30 minutes to figure out how to connect to my wireless internet, I gave up & searched the net for help. Well...I found out it wasn't my inability to work a TV, but a rather sly move by Samsung -- you see, this ""wi-fi ready"" product requires a LAN adaptor (so add another $80/90 to the price you're paying for the Blu-ray). THAT...is a bit frustrating..."
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO SAMSUNG?,"Samsung used to be a quality name, now Samsung seems to have fallen behind many other ""mid-range"" electronics in terms of quality and reliability.Bought this player for Christmas , worked well for a week or so , then freezes and glitches started to occur. Hasn't worked right since, I strongly suggest you do not buy this player, and do your homework if you are buying ANY Samsung products."
4,Great Picture - Temperamental Operation,"The picture quality is excellent, and I really like the features of being able to stream video through the device. I am happy with the product for the most part. My only complaint is that it does not always operate properly. Sometimes the DVDs will get hung up (won't play, FWD, REW, stop, or allow me to get to the main menu). The only way I have found to get past this is to open and close the DVD tray, then it usually works fine. It's a bit of an inconvenience, but other than that, it seems to be a good product."
2,Dissapointed,"I am disappointed with my Samsung player. It was very easy to setup, has an intuitive interface, and fantastic video. I have had a number of problems however.1. Blu-Ray DVDs pause and skip (Avatar wouldn't play at all)2. Audio doesn't always play from Netflix. The work-around is to first go to the Samsung channel and play one of their ""how-to"" videos for a few seconds THEN launch Netflix3. I can't add Amazon instant TV or Hulu Plus to my apps. I'm stuck with the few they provide or have agreements withOther than that the Samsung is an okay device. The company is diligent with firmware upgrades but my original problems remain. I am not sure if I will buy another."
1,wi fi ready hah!,"the wifi ready only takes specific samsung usb adapter, 70$!if you direct wire i am sure it is fine...but factor in 70$ or buy one that has wifi built in...not ""wifi capable""...i returned this item because it was not clearly marked, lost 8$ shipping! so beware!"
2,Misleading and disingenuous box info,"The large print giveth - the small print taketh away.The information on the box proudly proclaims: Connect to the internet with a USB wireless adapter (not included)!Not so fast, sparky, whats also not included, (You wont discover until after you buy this), is the information that not just any USB adapter will do, no matter how modern (I have one that supports wirelss n, the latest.)No, only after you read the manual will you discover that only the Samsung's very own adapter will work! And at a price of $75 for this adapter that can only be used for this one purpose, it seems that perhaps for good reason, this nugget of info was ""accidentally"" omitted.The first BluRay player I've ever bought, is now the first BluRay player I've returned to the store.I'm in no hurry, I can wait until someone gets it right, for under $200. When they do, they get my business."
2,dvd not very good,"As a blu ray player no problems .DVDs are the problem.Almost everytime I load a dvd it wont load or get's to the FBI warning screen and just sits there until I open it again and then reload.DVD quality is great. Also the manual open close button is sporadic. Had this problem with a previous Samsung DVD player,Not happy with Samsung ,,, quality is going down accdring to recent periodicals.Will not buy another Samsung player, go Sony or LG."
1,I'm taking this back tomorrow!,"One of the worst products I've ever purchased. It only plays some of my Blu-Ray DVDs, but not all of them. On the newer DVDs, it tells me I need a software update. My computer-savvy son and wife followed the directions explicitly, but the update didn't work. When I called Samsung, the customer service representative told me two ways to fix it. Neither worked. She stated that sometimes it takes up to two minutes to get it to work, and then she refused to stay on the line with me for those two minutes to see if it would fix the problem. She told me I would have to call back if it didn't work. This is some of the worst customer service I had ever received. Guess what? It did NOT work! I don't know if this has something to do with the fact that I bought it at Costco, but this Blu-Ray player is going back tomorrow. It's worth the extra money to get something that actually works."
1,Avoid!,"Hands down, the buggiest electronic component I've owned. Thank goodness Amazon returns are easy. Just hooked up Sony and far superior performance."
1,Remote didn't work out of the box!,The remote didn't work right out of the box. After spending some time with Samsung Customer support I was told it's their policy to wait 1 to 2 weeks before replacing a non-functional remote! WHY???? It's pretty hard to use the Blu-ray player without a remote. They have my money and I'm left waiting with a useless player...thanks a lot Samsung! I should have spent the extra $20 and bought a Sony. I will never buy a Samsung product again.
5,blu ray,"I was very happy with this product,I only had to buy an ethernet cord to get it to work. IT CAME WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS PROMISED AND LOOKS NEW."
2,bogus -- can't resume play,"Th performance of this unit seems to be fine. But when I pause long enough for the unit to power down, the disc will freeze. I can turn the unit back on, the on-screen display indicates that it is playing, but the image doesn't change. It stays frozen at the point where I paused it.The only fix I've found is to eject the disc, which takes me back to the beginning menu and previews.Incredibly annoying. I've never had any other dvd player with this problem."
2,Bl-Ray Internet player,"The menu is a bit confusing BUT that may be because I am a novice to media streaming. I am a bit disappointed in the movies and TV programs offered. I have only tried Net-Flex and Amazon Prime does not have an application to view their offerings. As I am using only an old 32"" LED Computer/TV monitor; I have just a composite connection. The results are very acceptable. I will add to this review when I get the Sony 46"" TV connected. I have just a small network and need to extend it to the TV room. I DO NOT like wireless connections and this unit needs an adapter to connect wireless.30DEC11, I have tried other DVD movies but few of of my older DVDs will play. That means that I will need another DVD player. However Blu-Ray disks play fine. I had to change my ratting from a 4 to a 2 because of it not being able to play my other DVDs."
5,Marvelous sourcebook for healing with flowers,"This book is very comprehensive, covering herbal remedies, essential oils, flower essences and homeopathy. The pictures of the flowers are beautiful and interesting to meditate on as one works with a remedy. It's very well written, appealing to both novices and experienced healers. I've learned so much from this book, and I continually turn to it for guidance and information."
1,Truly disgusting film!,"This has to be one of the more offensive movies that I have seen. It includes a highly improbable plot with gratuitous violence interspersed with some extremely boring scenes. As a depiction of Vietnamese society, it is feeding from the bottom of the garbage heap. So, if you enjoy a nice masochistic, nauseating flick, this one is for you. Otherwise don't waste your money on this piece of trash. What a great dissapointment after the Director's previous opus, ""The Scent of Green Papaya""."
1,Abysmal.,"This album is unlike any other ME, and that is not a good thing. If you want a far superior later outing, buy ""Everything is Mad"" instead. Overly glossy production. Like the other reviewers, I can't even make it through this album. Truly not good."
2,Contrary to popular belief...,"This album was NOT a tribute to actress Barbara Hershey, who got collagen-inflated lips for her role in the chick-flick of all chick-flicks, ""Beaches."""
2,Work Well; Not Much Brighter then Stock Bulbs,"These work well, but I only noticed a slight difference from my stock bulbs, so they're a little disappointing..."
4,Very Good Overall,"These bulbs are a bit brighter than stock, not as bright as many, but they last much longer. High wattage equals brightness and heat. Heat shortens bulb life. I use the headlights in the rain, fog and dark. I know bulbs that are incredibly bright but last around three weeks with only night use. My last roadtrip was over 10,000 miles I didn't want to replace the bulbs on a trip like that. Being a motorhead I am using the GE bulbs and plan on buying Hella 550 amber fog lights with clear lens guards with plastic covers over those. Remember to aim your lights correctly after polishing the plastic light covers.-Pete"
4,A GREAT BOOK ON GRIEF IF YOU ARE A WOMAN - NOT FOR MEN,"This is still one of the best books on grief written even despite my concerns - and please know that up front. But I could not believe the wording in the book and how many times SHE is used (what about us guys who have lost a wife) and she says it is for widowers but the language throughout is for women, and says nothing about the unique ways that men grieve. I think if you are a woman - buy this book it is a great book but if you are a guy you will be very disappointed as I was. It identifies with women. Did it talk about any of the things men experience after the death of their spouse - usually their ONLY FRIEND IN THE WORLD? did it deal with betrayal?? Did it deal with MALE SEXUALITY? The entire book is from the FEMALE PERSPECTIVE ONLY. Not a bit for men. It was a waste for me. I wasn't helped by it at all"
5,Being a young widow...,"is different than being an older one. This book basically explains that any way you approach it, being widowed is difficult...and any way you can find helpful to cope is ""okay"" and within normal limits. It also addresses delayed grief responses, which I found particularily helpful. Most things that I have gone through, angry feelings etc. are somehow brought up. The anectdotes are good. The book does give ideas, for those that want them, on how to have outside influences help you deal with grieving. Although some parts of the book are not always relevant, one can pick and choose which sections to read without loosing continuity.KT"
4,Excelente,Muy buen producto. Lo que esperaba.Lo recibi a tiempo. Ahora mi hija esta contenta.Lo que recibi fue lo mismo que vi en la PC.
4,Hi-Tops,My son wanted these for basketball and it was hard finding them. Ordered them - got them in great time and he really enjoys wearing them.
3,so-so,i bought these shoes for my 2-year-old son. But about two weeks after i recieved them i found pretty much the exact same thing in a national super-store for half of what i paid for these. i was disappointed. And i'm not sure how much my son likes the shoe going up on his ankle. Anyone looking to buy these shoes online should try some local stores first. i'm betting you'll find a better price.
4,competent Giallo-esque thriller,"Suprisingly entertaining Giallo-esque modern phsychothriller. Considering the peanut-size budget and mediocre but willing performances, this manages to hold the attention in this everything-but-the-kitchen-sink twist on the slasher film. There were more ""surprises"", false endings, and red-herrings that I could probably count; I'm not sure that's a good or bad thing (for me it's a GREAT thing). I was impressed by the complexity, character archs, score, and presence of mood and some splashes of style here and there. I enjoyed the film thoroughly, a very nice suprise. This movie deserves to find an audience!!"
3,Some glaring mistakes,"I think this book is good, since there are few other books about the subject of drum and bass, there are some glaring mistakes. For some reason they put Air (the French duo) in the drum and bass section and not the Trip-hop, Lounge, Big Beat area. Air clearly falls into the downtempo catagory. Second, in one review they noted that the Exploited wrote the song ""City Baby Attacked by Rats"" (it's an old hardcore punk rock tune) but it was GBH who did that tune. Bad mistake for a music historian. It also mimics Simon Reynolds book ""Ecstasy Generation"" too much. The opinions seem to be the same and the way Rough Guide is written also shadows Reynold's book. In addition, there aren't any keys to the symbols for CD or vinyl. I had to figure it out myself. And...some of the recommendations aren't the best samples of the artists' work. Kinda poor way to guide someone through a genre many find confusing. But, like I said, there aren't many more books about D&B out there."
3,Odd CD for Doctor Who fans,"This CD is commonly seen at Conventions at Dealers tables. I myself owned one over 5 years ago. But it was swiped by a fan of the KLF, not Doctor Who. Luckily the replacement copy is priced just right here at Amazon.com. If you are a Doctor Who fan, this CD is a must."
1,"Why Trent, why?","By far the worst of the Pretty Hate Machine era remix albums, the Sin single is basically three bad versions of the best song on Pretty Hate Machine with a mediocre cover of the Queen song ""Get Down Make Love"" for good measure. These remixes are horrible and extremely redundant. Imagine Sin. Okay, now image Sin if it were really bad. Okay, now imagine Sin if it were really bad being remixed by Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine. That about sums up what this release sounds like. Avoid at all costs."
5,Amazing - just one CON (read below),"This is easily one of the finest fragrances around for ladies.Got this for my sister, she loved it. That is the only Con. She keeps asking me to get her more when she runs out. Haha."
3,Just okay,"Dior J'adore is an okay fragrance, but isn't anything super special. It does have decent staying power, but I was expecting a primarily orchid-based fragrance, and this smells very fruity to me for some reason."
3,Final book of a series,"I read this book not knowing that it was the final of a series about a wealthy Jewish family in America.Theo is one of the US's top plastic surgeons when he loses the use of one of his hands in a tragic accident, caused by his wife Iris who is (unknown to her) the daughter of Paul Werner, a handsome, aristocratic millionaire who watches over Iris and his grandchildren from a distance.When Iris's son Steve Stern falls under the influence of Paul's cousin Tim, Steve is drawn into a circle of violent protestors against the Vietnam war and his very life and freedom are threatened. Paul decides to step in to protect his secret family from a chain of events which would threaten the peace and security of all of them.One would have to have read all of the preceding books in this series to fully appreciate this one and, as it flowed well, enough was filled in to understand where the characters were coming from. It was written in 1990 but read more like a 60's style novel."
4,A very good way to play music from computer,"The discussion below relates only to audio, not to connecting a printer, and working with a router cum wireless access port.Pro:1. This really works, and works well, from my PC computers.2. The control over what music is played, volume, etc. resides in your computer, not in the computer and the Airport. This can make life simpler, much simpler, especially if anything does go wrong.Cons:1. Pricey, especially when you factor in the cable kit which you are going to need if you want to run sound from the Airport into your sound system via a digital (optical) cable (this requires a proprietary cable), or will probably want if you don't want to (1) scrounge for your own cables, or (2) plug directly into a wall outlet and run stereo (L and R only) into your amplifier.2. They don't tell you this in the manual, but you'll be better off assigning the Airport(s) to static IP addresses, and selecting improved robustness against interference."
4,Coals That Smolder,"Into a community in the Pennsylvania valleys that set itself apart from this world by religion, customs, and language, the world intrudes. It enters with frightening echoes of the great horror of the century, the Holocaust. A rich texture of folklore, imagery, and language marks the lively dialogue and description. The seed of mystery, authentic and powerful, growa and makes for a tale full of surprises right to the last page. For goodness sake don't peek!"
4,Spice on the world stage,"About half way into this book, the tsunami of December 2004 hit the Indian ocean region bringing destruction to many of the places I had been reading of. Jack Turner has taken on a big topic, not merely a culinary treatise, but an overview of colonialism, folklore, religious dogma and cultural evolution. This is a feast of a book, rich with quotes from obscure (and not so obscure) sources.Turner's ability to follow the path of spices from their earliest known beginnings to today's trendy eating is apparent from the first pages to the last.Turner also writes with a sense of humor, something not always included in scholarly works.For any cook, any lover of history, student of colonial power and politics and anyone just interested in the evolving perceptions of culture, this book is a must read."
2,The not so tempting history of spices,"Jack Turner's book has been showered with unusual advance praise ('a brilliant, original history of the spice trade'), but its content is of rather mixed quality. The Introduction alone contains numerous errors, beginning with a reference to cloves in Syria 3,700 years (briefly published 20 years ago, but never substantiated) and an incorrect description of a nutmeg (the author failed to notice that nutmeg is not 'surrounded' by the mace, but sits inside a shell). For all the hard work the author put into this, too often he falls for the spectacular and exaggerated in a 'sex-sells' history of spices. While it makes for entertaining reading, it cannot be relied on as a balanced or scholarly piece of work. In contrast, I would recommend Andrew Dalby's 'Dangerous Tastes - The history of spices' - maybe a trifle less thrilling, but written with far greater competence."
3,75 pages of interesting material in a 334 page book,"This would have made a truly incredible long article in the New Yorker. Fascinating material, well researched, poorly edited.Far too long for even a determined reader like myself, I found myself skimming pages, then chapters, then putting the book into the pile for the used book store. The cover and end pages are covered with glowing reviews, but frankly I doubt most of the commercial reviewers (NY Times, SF Chronicle) read more than half the book."
2,Idiots doing stupid things,"Idiots doing stupid things, there is no real content in this movie, gets boring after 20 mins. Definitely not for a theater movie, just a time pass at home when your mind is stupid."
1,Patriots Steering Wheel Cover,Within a week the Patirots emblems were completely worn off. The seller did issue a refund promptly and was very concerned with my needs. Excellant customer service and much appreciated
4,Vision in a Blind Eye.,At first seems to be working too hard for amusement but as the mystery gains momentum the humor and story hold true.
1,Consider other product,"Be aware!! The First Accounting 2004 version is not backward compatible with the older version. Whatever information you built in the previous version can not be transferred to 2004 unless you upgrade to premium version, which means you have to pay a lot more for something you don't need and for just getting the conversion support."
4,Excellent hard case,This case is great for the TZ5 Lumix camera. It fits nice and snug in the case. There's room for a spare battery and memoryc card as well as a USB cable.
4,This is good Softs,"This is a good Soft Machine record. The most notable piece is Chloe and the Pirates. Really a triumph for 1973. Michael Ratledge's best piece ever. The album is a mixed bag really, with the last cuts being some of the best Softs and the earlier cuts being some of the most boring. Buy it for Chloe and the Pirates. You will not be disappointed! Decent spin!"
1,I don't believe this product is from Nine West...,"The picture show like it could be comfortable. I was so disappointed it when I tried it on. It was so comfortble and so stiff that I couldn't last more than few steps. I don't need shoes that hurt, I have hundred of them already. Shoe companies need to test their shoes before they release it to the public. I would never trust Nine West without try on."
2,disappointed....,"I cannot but rise my voice and join it to those who critically reviewed this album.I strongly loved the first solo album and when reading a new one was going to be released in the late 2006 I was really expecting such a mix of good songs following the success of LAMB.So disappointed. When I firstly heard the Wordi it Up single (with some friends) we all remained astonished!! What is that?!??! The new Heide cartoon soundtrack or what??? I said to myself, listen to the album more than a couple of times and give it more chances. Well, at the end I can say I only like Wonderful Life. No way out for the other tracks. What is that? a mix of beats and R&B...but; no melodies, no disco sound as in LAMB. What a delusion.Consider I am a DJ her ein Rome and I loooove to play Gwen during the dancing parties but....I am not gonna use any of the tracks of the last album...who'd dance it???Such a shame. A missed chance.Enrico"
2,Bad - just bad,"I was seriously disappointed by Gwen Stefani's new album, I who had been a hude fan of ""Love.Angel.Music.Baby"". To me, she just took all the (few) bad things about her first solo album and just developped and focused on them. Songs like ""Harajuku Girls"" or ""Hollaback Girl"" weren't my favorites but the rest of the album was so good they just seem to enhance the other songs. Here I counted only three good songs: ""The Sweet Escape"", ""Early Winter"" and ""Wonderful Life"". All the others are only moderate rip-offs of ""Hollaback Girls"", they focuse on the beat and Gwen's rapping (or more talking) makes me want to gag. The whole album just basically gives me a headache (I absolutely LOATHE ""Yummy"" - how ridiculous is Pharell?). Download those three songs if you want the best from her but I do not recomend buying this album for yourself or offering it to any die-hard Gwen Stefani fan."
2,The *Sweet* Escape - **Baff,"Gwen Stefani opened up as an artist with huge talent on LAMB, but here she wastes it all and loses all credibility.The terrible opening single ""Wind It Up"" is terrible; a combonation of erotic rap, The Sound Of Music and yodelling...GROSS!!! The rest isn't any better; like the vanilla-Kelis of ""Yummy"", the lame J.Lo wanna-be ""Orange County Girl"" and ""Don't Get It Twisted"".This disc does have someredeming moments but they don't save the record; the Madonna-esque ""The Sweet Escape"", ""4 In The Morning"" which sounds like a Kylie Minogue or Madonna down-tempo moment, ""Fluorescent"" which reminds me of Nelly Furtado's ""Glow"", the indie-rock-ish ""Early Winter"" & ""Breakin' Up"" the only good club single.This album is a massive step down from LAMB and has no appeal to any of her No Doubt fans and only some of her most loyal fans would mildly enjoy this. Gwen, next time, don't release your leftovers.xOxo"
1,Ugh..Not AGAIN,"Gwen has yet again FAILED to make something worth listening to. I am thoroughly disgusted especially about the fact that she's making this sort of crap when she's in her mid 30s'. This ""music"" she's been making sounds a lot like poser hip hop, and if she calls this fun, she's seriously wrong. Obviously, she doesn't comprehend that it IS possible to make a record that's mature AND fun. No Doubt goes way beyond this junk. This is definitley not for anyone over 13."
3,what happened gwen?,What the hell happened gwen? Gwen Stafani has gone loopy I bought this cd after listening to the sweet escape and wind it up. Awesome gwen songs. Those are the first two songs then song three comes on and it's like your transported to another world. Hip hop? RAP? what the hell is this. Gwen What happened. Do you even remember the no dought days? What a major disapointmet this cd was. We liked you the way you were. Try again gwen.
5,the best!,"i love her music and this is by far her best yet! ""don't get it twisted"" and ""now that you got it"" are my fav! i play this cd over and over."
2,For Real???,I downloaded this album thinking it would be as good as her last album. I'm quite disappointed. Yummy is absolutely annoying as well as a lot of other songs on it. What happened to her funk and creativity? I know she could do better than this. I'm starting to think about taking this album off my MP3 but maybe my 7 year old will like it. I'll just stick with her older albums and I don't recommend this to anyone over 20 - seems like a teen album.
2,A Disappointing Lack of Mature Artistry,"Two stars are awarded for the three most listenable trackson the disc (Sweet Escape, 4 in the Morning, Early WInter).The rest is immature, non-melodic, syntho-pop/rap garbage.This is not a mature album, nor is it much of a stretch for GwenStefani, who, now being a 35 year-old mother of two, can't seemto harness the power or maturity of her chronological age andapply it to her work as an ""artist."" Note to Gwen: the bubblegumrap/pop/syntho gunk about boyfriends and cell phones that youradoring 12-18 year fan base swoons over isn't broad or appealingenough to keep you singing much longer. This stuff ain't gonna flywhen your 40, girrrrrl. Find a new way to represent."
2,Boring,I was very disappointed in this CD. I was expecting a much better compilation than this music provided. Definately not one of her best cd's.
3,The Sweet Escape,"My favorite song on there is ""don't get it twisted."" I like the CD it's good, but I it's not one of her greatest. She did better music when she was with No Doubt. She's prettier now than she was back then, but her compilation of music on this Cd wasn't my favorite."
1,Gwen jumps the shark,"Either Gwen has started to believe her own hype or she surrounded herself with the wrong people. THis CD is a horrible mess; while i appreciate pop artists that try to be hip and stylish, gwen just doesnt pull it off; her aspirations dont match her talent. -And Gwen is now giving off a stanky self important diva vibe that kills her charisma. too bad, her last CD seemed to be a step in a good direction."
1,An assult on my ears!!!!,"This CD was an abomination!! Gwen needs to get back to her roots. Many of the tracks felt like they were just thrown together. The songs were also aimed specifically at dance clubs, which leaves her old fans hanging out to dry. Only 3 tracks were tolerable, ""Sweet Escape,"" ""4 AM,"" and ""Wonderful Life."" I think it is wonderful Gwen is trying to find new sounds, however, it should not be at the cost of alienating the fans who have been with her from the beginning. Maybe the next CD should go through a focus group before hitting the store shelves."
1,Bargin Bin Trash!,"This is another Gwen Stefani album that I had to somewhat sit through. She has never impressed me over the years. Her vocals are bad as well as the production. When she was in the group No Doubt, she was awesome, but she mailed in her career last year with that ""Love, Angel, Music, Baby"" album. A lot of these songs are completely pointless, and make absolutely no sense. One of my friends burned this album for me, incase anyone is wondering how I obtained it. Do yourself a favor and save yourself an hour and some change, or like me nineteen minutes skimming through the tracks and end up throwing the CD out your window while driving. If you really want this album, it will be in the bargin bin at your local record store for $6.99 somewhere in late Januaury. Oh how the great have fallen. Avoid if possible. 0 stars."
4,Great Product,"This product makes cutting mats a pleasure even when using 40"" stock, and with the optional glass cutter, solves the problem of adding a glass covering to the frame. Everything works just as advertised, and the included video tutorials are well done.The only addition I would have liked would have been a longer addition to the stop to keep the mat at right angle while cutting. This is really only a slight inconvenience when cutting glass."
5,The Beauty and Lore of Coins,"The Beauty and Lore of CoinsThis book has been my side kick since it was published in 1974.The photographs are great.It covers the entire numismatic range from primitive and ancient coinage to modern era artistic trend.The narrative is a refreshing adjunct to the main attraction of the book, the photography.I recommend this book.Read it once to understand it's scope and then refer to it periodically for a refresher on the art of the mint master.See also:Historic Gold Coins of the World"
3,Accounting background recommended,I don't want to rate the product as such (3 means neutral) but I would advise anyone thinking of using Peachtree to either have an understanding of accounting or an accountant nearby. It is a very good program but it does demand some accounting kowledge or technical skill.
4,"the actual eiffel tower is pretty great, too","this album is fun and very nice to listen to. if you like d-plan or postal service you would really enjoy this album, it has that kind of sound. but not ""popular"" yet so you indie rawk elitist mofos might still be able to enjoy it in front of your friends."
2,"Great to watch Lange and Nicholson, but, the film was lame","Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson are worth the watch..heck, i would watch a toothpaste commercial if they were in it. But this film is just not good. Bad writing, and the ending was a bit ridiculous. But, as i said, if you are a fan of these actors, it's interesting to see film."
4,Lost opportunity!,"Ok Tackhead are one of these groups that were probably better live than on record. They had actually supported Mark stewart and Gary Clail on some really great stuff but the records they released as a group never really seemed to gel in some way. The playing is great, the production fantastic but somehow it is too cerebral since they basically also want to be a funk group. The ideas would be plundered by many people later on but somehow I am not really sure why it sounds so cold."
5,Truly Inspired Satire,"These guys work in the same style as bands like Negativland, taking samples from radio and TV news, commercials, and movies, and seamlessly mixing them into tracks that you can really get down and dance to. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!If you like this CD, definitely check out their VHS tape, ""Commercial Entertainment Product"", which you can find on amazon.com if you search for ""Commercial Entertainment"" (the ""Product"" is chopped, so if you search for the full name you won't find it!)."
1,Completely Worthless,"I bought these for my epson stylus C62. After following instructions of cleaning the printer heads, I was able to print exactly 2 sheets and no more. This was true for each of the 4 cartridges. A complete waste of money. I then bought the authentic epson cartridge which is presently printing perfectly."
5,Tia's reveiw,"I think the book is a shock! I never suspected who the killer was. Cory, Miles, Fred, and Frank were just trying to play a faternity prank and Fred fell off the roof of a old house when they were trying to steal a bell. The hooded man blamed Cory, Miles, and Frank for Fred's death, but did they stop the hooded man befroe he stopped their lives? Read the book and you will find out!!"
5,Pretty earrings!,"I was surprised when I received these earrings. They're such a nice size. They were a birthday gift for my 10 year old grand daughter. I think they were a perfect size and fit, with wonderful sparkle. A very nice product."
5,This is like three books in one,"This book includes all of Bobby Fischer's games from 1955, to the 1992 rematch with GM Boris Spassky. Not annotated, but well worth it. Has opening index, ending index, and eco code index. Highly recommended."
1,Worst WDW Book Out There,"This book has very little information and could have been written by Disney employees (maybe?). I found the Unofficial Guide to have much clearer, truthful information that was useful during our trip. Save your money...no book is better than this one."
4,for fans only,"I originally saw this film on a late-night channel perhaps twenty years ago. It took me at least fifteen years to obtain a copy, which was subsequently damaged, so this is my second copy. As a Michael Moorcock fan it is a must, although apparently Moorcock himself hated the film. In many ways I can undestand why - as with many adaptations it captures the gist of the book but fails to understand the subtleties inherent in the written version. Thus satire becomes rather strange sci-fi. Still for all that I like it, though I can't say why.In summary, a good attempt at adapting a surreal book. It may fall short of the mark, but there is still some merit in what was a low budget production."
5,Planet Weird,This film is based on the original Michael Moorcock story of the same name. I have read the Moorcock version and I genuinely have to say that the film seems to be better. It is an existential romp through conscienceness. It takes you to a weird alternate reality of planet earth. In the end it leaves you with more questions than it answers (what can be better than that). You get to sit back and decide. A film that really makes you think.
3,A DVD ZONE LSD,"Wow ! Look at these colours : green, blue, yellow all over the screen. And look at Mrs. Brunner's hair : deep red. We're in the beginning of the 70's for sure. With a zest of English humour, a little sex (we know now that Jenny Runacre and Sandy Ratcliffe are real red-headed women), with interesting guest stars as Patrick Magee, Sterling Hayden or Harry Andrews and a little gore (after all, director Robert FUEST was responsible for the Dr. Phibes movies), THE FINAL PROGRAMME, also known as ""The Last Days of Man on Earth"", is a curiosity that deserves at least a rental."
4,"Fire, bad. Light, good.",These are headlight bulbs. They light up real good. They have inspired me to write the following haiku:GE Nighthawk bulbs for cheapAmazon ships fastIllumination is mine.Thank you.
1,"Wont Fit 2003 Ford Focus SVT, Fog Light Assembly.","The title says it all, this light bulbs wont Fit 2003 Ford Focus SVT, Fog Light Assembly. I ordered the light bulbs, I got the package, I was about to open it when I saw the electrical contacts were different to those used in the original ford light assembly. I even entered my vehicle info. and it said that ""this product will fit your 2003 Ford Focus SVT"" I am giving 1 star rating, not to the light bulbs themselves, but rather to Amazon's system that told me it would fit. Now I have to return 'em and Amazon is charging me for it."
5,Considerably brighter,"Some reviewers have questioned these bulbs' increased brightness. To put those claims to rest, I have replaced only one of these bulbs, and turned my headlights on. There is definitely a noticeable increase in brightness and color. These bulbs are whiter and I'd say 10-15% brighter on my 2009 Jetta. Definitely an improvement over stock bulbs. I've used Sylvania SilverStar Ultra before and had them burn out time and time again after just 3-4 months of use. These are a welcome change!"
3,They are just headlights,"Nothing special about them. They say 50% brighter, but they look the same as my stock bulbs. 3 stars for the product, 2 stars for the price."
3,lights are ok,"I have had a couple dozen light kits in my vehicles over the years and these lights are just ok. Their light color is probably around 3k. I have a set of HID 6K's in a truck and they are way on the blue side of the spectrum. These are yellow compared to them. Brightness wise, they are ok too. Nothing impressive. Hopefully they last for a while, that's all I'm banking on."
2,Lot brighter circumference. depth not so much,"While these bulbs are brighter than the stock Hyundai Elantra bulbs, the depth is not better. I was hoping these bulbs would shine deeper down the road."
4,"Doesn't seem brighter, but the price was good.","One bulb was burned out on my 2003 Golf. The other bulb was purchased from [...] After replacing the burned out bulb with the GE Nighthawk, the two bulbs seem about the same brightness. So I don't know what the GE bulb is 30% brighter than, but the bulbs were cheaper than the ones I've been using, so they still seem like good bulbs."
5,"1415 was not a ""good year"" for Constantinople",The author writes with knowledge and panash. Nothing boring. History comes alive in his writings. You actually feel that you are living in the time period. His books are not to be missed.
4,"Dated a little but a ""must have""","Because the book is now somewhat dated I would not use this as my sole source on this subject. HOWEVER, this is one of those books that plowed the field early on, and as such, has made a large impact. Great place to start, look for other sources, and it is readable!"
3,Bouncy,"Well, as fall-off albums go, this is miles better than Plain Rap, Love Movement, AOI Bionix...etc. This strays dangerously close to Westwood territory throughout, but somehow NBN keep it together. Not even orbiting the same planet as Poverty's Paradise, but still an engaging listen, with track 14 Family Tree bringing some of the original NBN flavour back."
2,definitely not their best stuff,"Two songs saved this CD from total disaster, Iicons and Wild Mo***** with Lil Jon. Other than that, the rest of the songs are average at best. It's definitely not like their older material. They changed their style I think, and not for the better either.I wouldnt recommend this to fans of their old stuff, but- take a listen for yourself first of course and see what ya think... I wasnt too happy myself. (The song IIcons rules though!!!!)"
1,sucks like all their stuff,no kay gee minus 20 pointsoutdatedplayed outtreach and pepa divorcedrap was moving towards the midwest and southyeah this group's datys were numbered.
4,Bars were much smaller than I thought they would be,"Love the soap, but the bars were not full size bars, as I have purchased in the past, but nearly the same price. Bummer"
2,Disappointed,"With all of the talent involved with this project, this CD should have been much better. Let's see how the next one is. Skip this one."
3,Good but not great.,"I find that the M.T. Choir sounds better on their Christmas music cds than they do on this DVD. And why WILL they change the words? It's written: ""And heaven and nature sing"" and they have changed it to: ""And saints and nature sing"". The production values are acceptable. And the Vienna Choir Boys portion is pleasant, but presented in the form of a ""story"" which I found silly and unnecessary. Just to hear them sing the carols is enough. The production values are fine.Overall: three stars. It could have been a lot better."
1,Hallelujah! Christmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir,"The audio is fine, great music. The video for the Vienna Boy's Choir portion seemed silly and takes away from the music. This might work best just to hear the audio and turn off the video."
4,Relaxing.,"Neat little book. Combines meditation with guitar. Great for acoustic and classical guitars, but I doubt it would help a metal head. Calms you down, chills you out, helps you see how beautiful the guitar's resonance is. Very deep and thought provoking. Great job!-Dr. Kenneth"
1,A weak attempt at applying Zen Philosophy to Guitar Playing,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I was very dissappointed in this book. The fact that many of the topics were covered with only one paragraph shows that the author is merely tacking on Zen quotes and ""soundbytes"" to the art of playing guitar, without any serious or in depth discussion of playing guitar. I have read several Zen texts and believe that others that also have, can draw their own metaphors and conections to not only guitar but everything. Sorry I thought this was really lame."
2,This book is a joke.,"Honestly, this book is the biggest waste of $6 I've ever spent. I didn't expect a book of scales or guitar theory, but literally every page is a bunch of worn out ""Zen"" cliches which don't have anything to do with playing guitar and therefore don't actually help you become a better guitarist.If anyone truly become a better musician, mentally or physically after reading this book, I do not understand it and would love to hear why."
5,excellent,"Finished this book in about two days and loved it! It presents a beautiful philosophy for music and life. As a begginning classical guitar student ( age 52) this book was just what I needed to help me relax and just play or as the author says.. just pickup[the guitar, tune, play.[ASIN:068483877X Zen Guitar]]"
5,Not for those seeking guitar lessons,"This is a wonderful book, but it is not used to teach guitar, as some reviewers have tried to convince you. It is meant to find the song within yourself, which will make playing the guitar more worthwhile and enjoyable.The premis is simple enough, that everyone has a song within them that makes them human. This book is meant to be a tool to come closer to that song. The path goes through a complete circle (white belt, black belt, and white belt again).To go through the full circle, you must work for it. With the work, your belt will become soiled and turn black. After it's black, the work will wear off any color, returning the belt to white.This is an excelent tool to be used, but it is meant for people who are serious about their guitar playing. Trust me, I play guitar, and it was a great help to enjoy guitar playing even more."
3,It's not what I expected.,"I thought the book would be a story where pooh learned about manners, like excusing your self before you leave the dinner table, but it's not. On one page there is one to two etiquette tips about two sentences long. On the next page there is a quick little skit with pooh and his friends, that in my opinion could have been written a little better to explain the tip on the opposite page."
2,Disappointed,"So many wonderful things in this hymnal, but the Kindle version is a disappointment. It's difficult to navigate, and there's no music. If you want to savor the richness of this hymnal, get the hardcopy book not the Kindle version."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I started reading this book hoping to learn some cool tricks and tips in CSS. So far I've read through the first four chapters and nearly everything relates to OLD versions of all the browsers. I looked at the published date which is 2007 so in computer terms, this is ancient history. If an updated version comes out it might be worth it but don't waste your money on this book."
1,0.5 STARS: YaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwN,"""The Hearse"" is a slow-paced, predictable and boring movie with some very bad acting. Joseph Cotton is pretty good, Trish Vandevere is fairly adequate although her character is stupid, but the actors who played Tom and the Hearse driver are nothing short of terrible...I mean they look like a couple of dorks! The ending makes no sense whatsoever and the movie ends with a thud. Quite frankly, I was bored out of my mind but decided to sit through the entire movie just to see how it ended. All things considered, this is a poor excuse for a horror movie."
2,IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EVIL VEHICLE MOVIES ...KEEP LOOKING,"Did you LOVE ""The Car"" ""Christine"" ""Maximum Overdrive and ""Duel?"" So did I ...But ""The Hearse"" was a lemon...."
3,Not the original album or band,"This uses the title of the original 1963 album but is not that album or anything near an original lineup of the group, but rather a newer lineup doing different songs."
1,Not the same,It isn't the same as the new cartridge. Cost less and does a lot less printing. It also leaks toner so my printer doesn't print a very clean copy. You get what you pay for.
1,Trash...,(...) I thought it was flash cards for studying. Don't buy it.It's a laminated piece of paper. Don't buy it.It is a yellow 8.5x11 paper with a barocde and holes in the side for putting in a binder. It has some grammar rules that can be had from the internet for free.
1,No Way!!!!!,"I am a 12 year old girl named Jamie Laliberte. We have been reading ""Banner In The Sky"" as a class and I think this is a very boring book. Most of my friends and classmates agree with me. This is the most boring book I have ever read!!!!!!!"
4,No Surprises,"As expected, the book turned up in great shape.Being an instructor, this helps to know original, published copies can be obtained without any negative surprises. In fact, the surprise was delightful. Thanks for giving an honest product description."
5,you should have a dream to tutch the sky !,"I love this book ! I've read it five times,three by my self , and once with my dad , and once with my classmates ! SO read it !"
4,Banner in the Sky,"The Disney movie, Third Man on the Mountain, was based on this book, so I had to read it. Excellent read. While the movie had extra plot line, characters--the book goes into the thoughts and feelings of this young man who is going to climb the mountain that his father died on. The memorable moments for me were when he took shelter in the cave his father died in while heroically trying to keep his friend from freezing. And the prayer of course that drove away the terrors of the mountain. The local climbers believed that demons ruled that mountain."
1,Madonna attempts to act part 10,I'd give this movie two stars if it weren't for Madonnas poor acting ability. She tends to drag this silly movie down even further with a forced and one dimensional performance.
5,Madonna's best performance....,"Dangerous Game is a movie which contains Madonna's most honest and natural performance. The unfortunate part is that the movie is so bad and hard to watch that not many people have seen it, mostly maybe hardcore Madonna fans like myself. She saves the movie from being a complete waste and just to watch her scenes alone is a treat and fast forward the rest . It's unfortunate that Madonna's good performances get lost in small movies what not many people see."
1,Not an Arabian Halter,"Product is described as an ""Arabian Horse halter Track, 3/4 inch"" Brown"" Everything is accurate except for the Arabian part... this thing is huge. have to return it...what a hassle."
4,"Great, but missing a great recipe","I'm on the Atkins diet, and I'd gotten this book in the hopes that it would contain a recipe for Lemon Basil Salmon. I'd been dying for dish this since I'd tasted it at Pizzeria Uno (I know -- you'd think it's just a pizza joint, but it's really got a lot of stuff). It's on their low-carb menu (7 net carbs!) and it's fantastic -- just grilled salmon with some lemon, basil and thyme served with broccoli and tasty low-carb smashed! Unfortunately, it was missing this recipe.Don't get me wrong, Atkins folks -- there are plenty of fantastic and easy-to-make recipes here for healthy salmon dishes. But for the perfect Lemon Basil Salmon, looks like I'll have to head back to Pizzeria Uno."
5,Superb!!!5++stars for battleflag...,"BEST~ of the rest!i love this song since the 1st time i heard it from the MTV.....It's a song that shout out its anger, desire and power ... its rythm and beat make u feel so high while concentrate to the song with both eyes closed .....i've been looking for its mp3 for nights.....now i've got it..... :).. Absolutely wild !!! its mtv was simple but real.....almost every night i turn on MTV channel and hoping for the song.....i really crazy for this song after led zeppelin.....whom i've collected their albums and t'shirts too....."
2,GO WITH THE COOL MIST,"i had always used a typical vaporizer with my children, especially when they would get stuffy noses or colds. i was always under the impression that this was the best way to help with that congestion. until, with my second child, his ped. told me not to use these. she explained how the added steam and warmth to the air will actually make congestion worse. i was skeptical but i tried it, and switched to a cool mist unit. WHAT A DIFFERENCE! the cool mist gives the added moisture needed without adding the warmth to the air that can cause for greater congestion. i mean really, think about it. in the warm of summer when the humidity is high, it is harder to breathe, right?"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this for my two year old with a cold. I bought and put the vicks liquid into it and hardly no steam came out. Also, I couldn't even smell the vicks stronger enough for her to breath it in, so she breath better. I figure for the price it would of been good, but I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Beautiful Music,Buena Vista Social Club is Fantastic.The Music&Vibe are So Incredible.It's very Educational.It Has Such a Rich Quality About it.ALOT OF PROPS TOO RY COODER&THE MANY GREAT ARTISTS FEATURED HERE Telling THeir Stories&Sharing Their Visions.A Must See&Have.It's TImeless History.
3,A bit dull...,"I only watched part of this, as it seemed to be mostly about the recordings. It is a piece of history, and some of the musicians in the film have died. I want to watch it again when I am more in the mood for this kind of music; all I have in my head these days is Black Sabbath, and the two don't blend. But the idea of discovering a Cuban Nat King Cole is just incredible to me, and you can see and hear it right there. Amazing. The scenes of the city are just great. I want to go to Cuba some day. The intro with the photographer showing off some of his best pictures (Fidel Castro at the Lincoln Memorial, which was called ""David and Goliath"" is just great propaganda) is just fantastic documentary-making."
3,Great filming of Cuban Musicians,I recommend this documentary. Sensational musicians and timeless music contrasts with Cuban social conditions. The film's perspectives give a true natural sense of the country and it's musical roots. * Try to purchase the DVD separately (1 disc) because the music CD does not reflect all of the music from the film and contains only 5 songs. Best to purchase individual music CD's featuring artists from the film.
1,Que Lástima!!,"Que Lástima ver a los maestros de la música cubana teniendo que aguantar a un músico tan mediocre como Ry Cooder, a quien se le ocurrió que una guitarra electrica (pobremente tocada con slide de blues además) va bien con el mas puro son de Cuba?. Es muy triste ver lo que músicos tan consagrados y legendarios tienen que hacer, aceptar y soportar por un poco de difusión fuera de la isla.Si busca un verdadero documental sobre la musica afro cubana busque ""Calle 54"", es en verdad excelente !!"
3,Good... not great..,"After getting through the ""novelty"" of being a document about Cuban musicians-- me, being an American, who has been cut off from Cuban culture and music, by the American government's economic and social embargoes, I couldn't help thinking that every single town in the world has a handfull of bands like this-- bands that played in a small neighborhood bar on Saturday night.. Well, bands like those have their time, then they break up, like this band."
3,Beautiful Music.,"Enjoy the ""just-okay"" audio of this DVD, and buy the CD for the better journey through some very moving music. The subtitles are cheap and sometimes difficult to read. The story is engaging.Briefly, this DVD is a gripping documentary of the condition of Cuba. The faded pastels on crumbling buildings...beautiful ocean waves crashing over seawalls...streets with huge potholes filled with water, the skyline obscured with laundry lines. The real story here is what bad shape that country appears to be in...."
5,Great documentary,"This is an outstanding and very enjoyable documentary about a number of elderly Cuban musicians who have been brought together again after having been retired for many years. They show they indeed still have their stuff, and can still give lively performances of their music, despite being 80 or even 91 years old (in the case of the guitar player). The piano player's virtuosity was especially amazing. The movie alternates between musical scenes and interviews with the performers. Although I don't know much about Cuban music, I found this to be a engaging look at a perhaps forgotten era of Cuban music, recreated by some of its greatest performers."
4,An excellent documentary of the history of Cuba's music-,"An excellent doumentary of the history of Cuba's typical music. As a child, my mother introduced me to this cultural delicacy, from the times when she used to be a flamenco dancer and singer in Spain and later in Cuba b.c. (before castro). These typical salsa/island rythems and the quality of the documentary in the style of Wim Wenders and Ry Cooder are no surprise that the music won a Grammy. The local shots of Havana in 1998 make you wonder how our neighbors to the south can live in such terrible conditions and still play such happy music.The economic conditions typified in in the film depict present-day Cuba and give creedence to the saying that only the good die young- reason for why castro is still in power and still alive after so many years of his nonsense and dictatorship.Definitely worth 101 minutes of your time!"
4,"Very nice designs, light on the detail","The designs in this book are great. However, the threads used are mostly Appleton and Paternayan and the book contains a conversion chart between DMC and Anchor.... Also, no information is given for differing lengths of thread for each brand. This makes conversion into a different thread brand extremely difficult.Another weakness is that the charts are simply colored, without additional markings to differentiate between similar tones.Just a little more attention to these editorial details would have made this book truly excellent."
4,"Unique, to be sure","While from a literary perspective, this is no masterpiece, it nonetheless captures a unique portrait of early twentieth-century Italian immigrant life. My great-grandfather, Nicolo, worked with tile in Philadelphia around the same time of the setting in this book. Many of the stories I've heard growing up make more sense now having read di Donato's novel.The writing is stilted at times (di Donato's attempt to make the English sound Italian), and he allows his characters to go on angst-ridden rants for far too long. But there are numerous gems in this piece. I wholeheartedly recommend it -- to Italian-Americans to learn a little more about their heritage and to all others to catch a glimpse of early Italian immigrant life in America."
2,This Album...,This album is awful! This is by far the worst excuse for an album. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the song I Do (Wanna Get Close to You) is very good. The rest of the album is ....
3,dont know if it works yet...,"ordered 2 bottles. almost done with the 2nd bottle and will have sperm recount afterwards and see if there is an improvement. if you take the capsules with an empty stomach, the pills do have a bad ""reflux"" taste to it so have some food before you take it."
4,I can't say for sure that they work but.....,"After trying for over a year, my wife was pregnant within 3 weeks after using. Could be a coincidence, but for the price it was worth the piece of mind."
4,forthegirls,"This video I can recommend to all women who enjoy watching men exploring each others naked bodies. It's not first rate porn, but gives good insights to gay male sex any girl would find well worth watching. And the guys in it look fairly O.K, too."
2,A text book rather than a reference guide,"Having read this book I feel that the author has over emphasised certain aspects, e.g. the theory at the expense of applications. The impression is that the series editors have encouraged the writing of a text book, filling many pages with information that is not readily useful to the researcher or industrial scientist"
4,Outsmarting the MidLife Fat Cell,Really good book. I went from a size 2 (my entire life) to a size 8 in a matter of 2 years. For the life of me I could not figure out what was going on. I have always been an active person and I eat pretty good. This book gave me a lot of insight into my own body. My mother had finished menopause at 42 and at the age of 38 I was at a loss. I would recommend this book to all women between 35 and 50.
4,Calling all Street Fighter buffs...,I must have movie for anyone dedicated to the Street Fighter series. This movie is my personal favorite. I recommend anyone with a thirst for action purchase this movie.
4,Street Fighter II: Animated for your viewing pleasure.,"What can I say? I've been a Street Fighter fan since it first appeared. I found the live-action version nauseatingly dissappointing and expected to find the same for both this version and the Alpha movie.I was wrongThis movie follows the overall plot of the Street Fighter II game, with Ken Masters and Ryu having to confront Bison and his Shadowlaw syndicate. The fight scenes range from short and fast through to prolonged duels of will. The opening scene showing the famous fight between Sagat and Ryu that gave Sagat his scar. Masterfully done.What lets it down is the bad script...alot of it doesn't seem to really fit...but just ignore it and revel in the Hadoken effects hehe."
3,Would like it to be uncut,"The film is quiet good,the only thing that was annoying was that it is not uncut like the jap version which includes the chug lee shower scene"
3,Great artwork and fighting scenes. But.........,"This is probably the best anime ever created, based on a video game title. But the sad thing about this DVD version is the lack of the original japanese dialogs, soundtrack and cut scenes (Like the entire Chun Li shower scene). I would not recommend you to get this DVD version unless you can't find the original japanese version with english subtitles. But I hope that they will rerelease this title with an addition of the original jap. soundtrack and cut scenes."
3,NOT SF MOVIE,"Why does this (Soul Power), and SF II: The Animated Movie have the same reviews? They are two different things. All the reviews here are for the animated movie. SOUL POWER IS NOT THE MOVIE!!!! It is simply season 2 of the American animated Street Fighter series shown on the USA network in the 90's. C'mon, people.Anyway, this series isn't nearly as good as any of the Japanese anime, even Street Fighter II: V. But hey, if you're an SF fan, and you want some change or even just to see what it's like, go ahead and pick this, up. But don't forget to pick up Season 1 first! It's called Code of Honor."
4,If your a fan of Anime this movie is for you.,"This movie is Great! It has a plot, follows the video game closely, and has great action scenes."
2,Not Widescreen and Not Remastered,"The uncut version of the movie gets about 3.5 stars. The 2 star rating is for this DVD. My biggest gripe with this DVD is that it is not truly widescreen. It looks ""widescreen"" but signal output is in 4:3 ratio, meaning the black bars are part of the image and you can never get rid of it, even on a 16x9 TV. This DVD is designed for those still watching on SD TV sets. The picture also does not look remastered, IMO. About the same as the old DVD that came out back in the 90s.Other than that, it has the uncut Chun Li shower scene on the Japanese side, and this is the first time an official US release included a Japanese language track (to my knowledge). These are probably the biggest reasons to get this version over the others. If you don't own this movie in any other format, by all means pick up this one.I'm hoping there will be a bluray later, that is truly widescreen, remastered, and completely un-cut."
4,Insightful & enjoyable mix of travel & cultural reportage.,"This book truly brings the world of Latin baseball to life. Mixing history, travel writing, sports enthusiasm & politics, Krich documents the (declining) importance of baseball in the Latin American countries closest to the US & its influence. He struggles on occasion because he alternately refutes & repeats stereotypes about Latinos, players & nonplayers alike. Some reference material (e.g. a reading list, maps, etc.) would make the book more useful, but overall it is both amusing & insightful, notably on the politics of baseball in US-Nicaraguan relations. Students in my Latin American history class have shown a keen interest in it. It should be brought back into print!"
4,Only In Texas,"Truly a spellbinding well told tale of an incredible series of mysterious deaths among the rich horsey set in Houston during the late 60's, early 70's. The Blood of the title is not about gore but about the strange family goings on, with venomous old coots, cool as can be madams, drug addicts, liars, and gossips. Money is all over the place in this, impacting family relationships and infecting the court system in ways so bizarre you find yourself saying ""They couldn't have!"" like some shocked old Victorian. Very, very good."
3,Photos missing,The original version of this best seller had had photos relating to the characters and locations. These photos gave the book interest and a sense that this was a real crime. The photos were an important part of the reading experience.The current publisher does not include any photos except for the cover photo which is of very minor interest.This omission is disappointing.
1,Don't bother,"I had high hopes when starting this book. The reviews were so favorable. I received this and ""Serpentine"" as gifts. I gave up after about 200 pages. It was bogged down by an extended history of the victims family for 3 or 4 generations, and it was slow moving. If you value your time, read something else."
4,"Not the best, but pretty good.","I bought a 10 pack of these when they fist hit the shelves, and I must say, I was really impressed with how they sped up my CD listening in the ol' stereo! BUt I decided to try them with my PC CD-Roms, and it was less than special. It actually seemed to slow me down. But that's probably because my desk is such a wreck!"
1,Waste of Money,This is by far the worst DVD I have ever seen. Do not buy this so called movie we all hated it and want our time back as well as cash. Horrid.
3,Only for avid fans,"I love Gil Scott Heron. His ""the revolution will not be televised"" and ""man on the moon"" made a great impression on me. But this album lacks any thrills. GSH is not a great singer. He has a nice soft voice and a good ear, but he is not a singer. He is at his best when he recites poetry - and this has been his way of giving us something worthy. His gift for words is still there, although he is much more mature and relaxed. Maybe a middle aged family man just can't sound like a 20 year old ! Anyway, I don't regret having this CD as it teaches something, but I recommend his early CD's to start with."
1,Poor support from Symmantec,"I've owned Ghost, and a number of other Symmantec products. Unfortunately, I have found their support to be AWFUL. If you can't find your question in ""Commonly Asked Questions"" on their website, you're out of luck. If you email a question to their tech support, they simply refer you back to their commonly asked questions (FAQ's) on their website. After becoming thoroughly disguisted with their products, I tried to uninstall them from my computer. That too, is next to impossible as it often requires going into the system registry. If you want to upgrade a Symmantec product, you must completely uninstall and remove any previous version(s). Therefore, you aren't doing an upgrade, rather, you're deleting all your previous saved data and then installing completely new headaches for yourself. Symmantec products, in my opinion, are really BAD news."
5,Faithful service for almost 5 years,"Bought in late 2002 after using previous versions, this is still the most reliable and fastest version ever. From win 95, 98 to winXP SP2, its a workhorse and does it job flawlessly.I would like to upgrade to a newer version of Ghost and am investigating the pros and cons of doing so."
3,Helpful so long as you're patient,"I've used this product for four years. While I've been displeased with it at least a half a dozen times, I eventually got used to its being ""moody"" and it behaves like it should when I need backups onto CD's. However, if(as another reviewer wrote), Symantec no longer offers tech support, I couldn't enthusiastically endorse it."
1,Not for average users,I also bought the Norton to back up to my external Maxtor Harddrive (which I found out it doesn't do). Not only was the help menu complex but it required more than just an average knowledge of computers and how to back up data. I bought it for an easy back up and it turned out to be too much for quick back up jobs.I'm sure it's a great product for more advanced people. But for those of us who want to push a few buttons and back up our files this is not the product to buy.Just my .02
4,Piano strings.,"Thaddeus Carhart writing of the rekindling of his affection for pianos and playing drew me into this memoir of his experience with a piano shoppe in Paris. I've sent it to two of my brothers, both of whom have a connection with either playing piano now or in the past. I learned much about the history of the piano while reflecting on the intangibles that playing an instrument adds to our lives. Enjoy!"
3,Don't bother if you're expecting a plot,"Perhaps I misunderstood that this was a memoir, and not a novel... In fact, it is a piano-lover's passionate (and true) tale of finding the perfect piano, bringing it home, and enjoying it. I'm sure it was quite a lovely instrument, and I learned quite a bit about the fine points of tuning and purchasing a piano-but it was NOT entertaining. If you're not a piano lover, don't waste your time."
2,"Interesting information, but no real story line","After about 2 chapters, I thought, ""Okay, I can't wait until I'm done reading this."" Carhart does include interesting information about the history of the piano, but other than that, the book is really boring.I feel I can best sum up my thoughts like this: The Piano Shop on the Left Bank could have been Joe's Mechanic Shop on the East Side. The story in this book seemed analogous to a story about a guy searching for his dream car and recalling personal and ""deep"" anecdotes along the way. Yes, a piano is unique in many ways, but I don't think Carhart writing 268 pages about this uniqueness was justified. It could have been rewritten as a short story, with all of the interesting facts about tuning, piano history, etc. in an appendix.Again, the entire time I was reading this, I was anxious to finish it because it was so boring."
3,Not terribly memorable,"While the author has an engaging style, this book seemed quite padded with extraneous material that leaves you with little to remember at the end. There are some childhood memories sprinkled in, some interesting history on the evolution and culture of the piano but the actual scenes in the atelier in Paris are lackluster. Such a book might be enjoyed by piano or classical music devotees or expats wanting to relive their time in France. But for the general reader, I would keep browsing..."
2,Interesting and informative...initially,"The book started out on an interesting premise: the mysterious piano workshop. The first chapters are quite charming and entertaining as we get to know the main characters and their appreciation for the piano and some of its history in Western Europe, which satisfies the piano enthusiast in me. The introduction of the piano's mechanism is adequate but not very engaging, as the nature of topic, perhaps. After the focus shifted essentially to the author's social life in Paris, however, the book becomes a tiresome series of journal entries and seeming existential profundities. The characters become progressively less interesting as they're examined, but not quite human enough to induce empathy. Overall, I'm disappointed by this book's failure to deliver on its promise (to me, at least), and resorting to the formula of let's examine the Europeans and their quaint ways..."
2,Not-exactly-a-kid review.....I am a freshman and an AVID reader.,"I really did not like this book, for the simple fact that it is very short, with too much happening. It never goes into much detail, just sort of skims over everything lightly touching on the main points. When I read it I felt like I was in a haze, nothing really stood out, so basically it is less than it's cracked up to be."
1,Very poor DVD quality,"This review concerns the DVD quality only, not the the movie.It is one the worst DVD I have purchased up to now. Very shoddy transfer, washed colours, trembling images.The sound seems to come from the adjacent room (with the door closed).Mya exploits the passion of many customers throughout the world. Alpha video quality at Criterion price.What a bargain!"
1,This DVD is a joke,"This is obviously a very bad VHS transfer: unbearably horrible video quality, superbad audio quality.All this at, more or less, the price of a Criterion DVD.This is the last time ever that I buy a DVD from Mya.Shame on you!"
5,Good book for all horse owners,"Wonderful, wonderful facts and such on ideas for tackroom, stalls, vet. and anything related on taking care of your horse. I also bought her Almanac, which is fun with lots of facts for the year on what to do and even what to see."
4,Angel and the Badman,"I got this in a two movie set on sale at a major retailer, the other movie was McLintock! These aren't actually ""official"" releases. The quality of the disc was pretty good on this movie mostly due to its being a b&w; film, I suppose.It's actually one of the Duke's best westerns. He's an outlaw, been wounded badly & is on the run. He passes out, falls off his horse & is brought home by a family of Quakers. Here is our conflict: we have a family that's adamant about non-violence & a man who lives by the gun. The film co-stars Gail Russell; she's the daughter of the Quaker parents & the love interest. She tries to convert the badman into a Quaker. Duke, for his part, makes a sincere effort. Of course, it's his past that comes back to haunt him & almost forces him to return to his violent ways. It's a stark western scenic-wise.There's a bonus feature here too but almost aa Duke fans will know this stuff anyway. Get the popcorn, baby, we watchin' the Duke tonight!"
3,Discuraged:(,"Either the battery is dying or the second hand button gets stuck, this was a christmas gift to a special man in my life and a die hard bronco fan, sadly he wore for most of the day and already we noticed a defect. I prurchased a month ago and now I may not be able to return.>:("
