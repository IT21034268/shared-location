5,hope for us yet,"Gives us all hope that love can come later in life. Sally Field & James Garner play wonderfully as lead characters. Definitely a chic flick, but a great way to spend a cool fall afternoon."
5,Best romantic movie ever,"If you never cared for Sally Field, you will love her in this movie. If you remember James Garner from Rockford Files or other things, you will love him for this role. Both were wonderful on the screen together, bringing old fashioned romance to a new height and enthusiasm.This movie is funny, sweet, tender and restful. No matter what your age, this movie will touch your heart in many ways from the old geezer in love with a young woman ""for the last time"", to her, in love finally ""for the first time"" to someone who really cares for her.Her X husband is in the mix making it more spicy and interesting but never vulgar. Their son is a normal boy raised by a single mom with all its ups and downs.This is a timeless movie. It will last."
5,Love it!,"Murphy's RomanceI saw this movie years back when it first came out. I loved it then and still do. It's one of those movies that stands the test of time. Sally Fields and James Garner make an unlikely but powerhouse romantic couple. You laugh and maybe even shed a few tears, but you're left with a 'feel-good' feeling long after watching. I would highly recommend it."
2,B&D Cordless Screwdriver,"I have a very mixed review of this item. I had a much older version which lasted me at least 10 years. This newer one worked fine when it worked - but it broke after about 1 year. I took it apart to see if it was fixable, but the internal gearing had broken beyond repair, so I threw it away. I suppose for the price you could consider it a disposable tool. But I would have liked it if it lasted longer. I will not be replacing it with another B&D, and I would NOT recommend this tool to anyone."
3,It holds CDs,"Works well, easy way to organize CD or DVD media. Comes with thumbtacks that are the perfect size to secure it to the wall. It's a little smaller than I expected (another row and column would be nice). It comes folded in the package and the creases from the folding don't really work themselves out. If they made it from a less brittle and stiff plastic it would work better."
4,A Fantasy,This deals with a common fantasy of neighbourhood watch meets high school discipline. It is well written if a little heavy in the content
1,one of my worst recent purchases,"I heard Radio 4 in a bakery in Manhattan, and thought I'd like them since the sound reminded me of Stooges. Just like with many film sountracks, the setting must have been crucial, because when I got this thing home I absolutely hated it. I had read a bad review on Amazon, ignored it in favor of my positive recollection from the bakery. Should have listened to the bad review.This music is painfully forced, like watching a group of your not-so-rockin buddies trying very very hard to rock. The lyrics are embarassing to anyone over 17. Some call this band political. Judging from this record, they are just naive, bratty, and irritable. Maybe other albums are better than this, but this album is completely awful, so that's not much of an achievement. I have nothing good to say about this album."
3,Something for everyone,"Doesn't matter how long you've been in sales, or whether you even consider yourself as in sales, you can learn from the experience of the master. The speakers style will keep you listening as you hone your craft and increase your income."
5,Music for your kids that you will love too!,"Hans Mayer does it well again with ""Good Morning!"" To give you a sense of his appeal, I was at one of his live shows recently where my 14-month-old, eighth-graders, and parents were all laughing and singing along. My 2-year-old son loves the train songs, too. This is solid family entertainment with good values to boot!"
2,"Great item, but blades break easily",I purchased this for my son for Chriustmas and he loved it. It is for the most part die cast except for the blades. Both tail rotor and main rotor are plastic. He took the item into school to show and two main blades broke. The connection to the shaft is to weak. Otherwise this is a nice item. Just be warned that the main blades can break very easily at the shaft.
2,"Important, I suppose, but almost unreadable","You can be a Linux enthusiast yet still find this book about as dull as the instruction booklet for your microwave oven. It's a combination of corporate cheerleading, meeting minutes, and open-source propagandizing. I approve of Young and his efforts, but this badly written, chaotically organized, and totally colorless book gives them a bad name. It has none of the atmospherics and vivid personality of, say, a book like BURN RATE. I cringe to say it, but even Bill Gates's THE ROAD AHEAD was more interesting..."
5,Lovely!,"Yes.. the first ten minutes are kind of silly, especially the knit picking short. But after that it's just lovely! The quality is very good for such vintage film. The women are beautiful and happy and often outdoors. No angry porn faces or fake tits, just lovely women having a good time. You can even see them giggling while they spank and whip each other :o) The music is irritating, but you can always turn it off- the films are silent."
2,Remanufactured?! Metalazer Tech?!,"Received shoes today and I am a bit disappointed. There were several details left out by Amazon on their features/details page for this item. First off they are not Pro Techstar as the picture would suggest. They are Metalazer Tech? Secondly they are not made in Canada nor are they new. It clearly states on the box - ""Made in China - Remanufactured by Satisfied Brakes/Ontario Canada. Knowing this ahead of time I would of not purchased these. Hopefully they install and perform properly. 2 star rating for poor advertising and misinformation."
1,"Counterfeit product, not what is pictured.","I purchased these, knowing that genuine maxell batteries come in the blue and silver hologrammed foil packaging as pictured, but what they delivered was a counterfeit in red, white, and black packaging. Stay away!!!"
3,Interesting Read,Bought this book to assist with my travels through the WW1 battle sites in northern France. Found it gave factual and detailed accounts of the major battles and did not express too much in the way of opinions about the conduct of the war or why it was fought - which I guess was the purpose of the book. Some background about the chief players and their competence in the conflict was given but not in any great detail. The accounts of the various battles were often a little confusing as reference to places were made which were not apparent to the reader and not backed up by rudimentary maps. Not a bad read however.
2,Wiseman Can Do Better,"The true melancholy flavor of the music was lost.Acoustics were poor. There was too much noise fromthe bar crowd. The performers were trying to betoo cute and jazzy for the crowd; instead of justplaying it straight. A good reason to not buy arecording made in a bar, especially a Texas bar."
5,another great book by I. Wyatt,"I have to admit, I don't think this writing is a interesting (at least to me and my daughter) as the Seven Year Old Wonder Book (one of the best books ever) simply because some of the wording is a bit difficult for my daugher and myself to figure out. Some of it is written in Irish brouge and you really have to be able to figure out the context clues which is ok, but when you are 6 and reading it by yourself then you may get a bit lost. So, this book we are reading together. So far it is very well written and I would suggest it as a wonderful book to be read."
3,For the money it works well,Great deal for the $199 I paid. Came in all original boxes like from the store. Maps may be 2006 but older roads are not in the system. A bit slow with reception but once you get the idea of how to type in addresses it is easy to use and has been pretty acurate. Works well for what I need.
5,Why would anyone NOT buy this!!,Great GPS. For the money--I dont know why you would not buy this. Works right out of the box--no problems. Hubby is a truck driver and saved him an hour finding a shorter route. Might buy more for gifts!
3,Pretty good product for price,"Overall, this is a good product for the price. There are some issues that I came across:- The system is a bit slow and freezes occasionally. One would then have to wait a while until it unfreezes. The screen refresh rate is quite slow when one is trying to Zoom In/Out quickly as well as scroll the map. This is quite annoying when one is trying to use unit in map mode to just lookup streets.This unit is a GREAT assistant in driving. However, I am hesitant to ""totally"" just rely of the unit's voice prompts while driving in unfamiliar areas.All in all, this is a great unit for such a low price. It was also fairly easy to setup."
1,Likes and Dislikes,"I have now owned the 360 for 3 weeks.I enjoy being able to put in an address and follow it. It has benefitted me and I have yet to use it to the maximum level possible. I must admit I have yet to read the book.The bad is that it does not accept all addresses. I use Yahoo to map out sometimes to compare. The address that Yahoo will map out will not necessarily input to the Magellan. The second bad point is the loss of signal at key times. Cloudy days and winter as we have now do not go well with the Magellan. Several times it has taken forever to pick up or reconnect to the signal. Third, don't always believe the 360 on what side of the street an address is located or a turn must be executed.Overall I would still buy at the price I paid. It is worth the price as a playtoy in the auto to assist in driving.The other bad point is the"
3,Magellan 360,"For a very inexpensive purchase, the 360 is nice. The 360 is for my daughter, but I have a Garmin Nuvi 350 for my own use in business travel. The 360 lacks a convenient Detour re-reroute, and because the street name choice is presented before you input the city name, it forces you to know if you want St, Dr, Ct, N S E W, etc. and presents you with a long list to choose from. Also, it sometimes is unable to find intersections if you put the wrong street in first. Compared to my Garmin 350 it can be a frustration, but it also cost me 3x to buy the Garmin!"
4,magellan,Very pleased with product. Only rethinking I have to do is to use townships in PA instead of the mailing city. Have used on multiple occasions and go where I was going easily even when I physically missed a turn
3,"Good GPS but calculations are slow, out-dated maps","This is a good GPS so far as the basic functionality goes but it takes a hit when it comes to Satellite Fix, Speed of calculations etc.Pros-*Large screen, easy to read even on a sunny day.*Loud voice prompts.Cons-*Slow calculations*takes long tim to get a Satellite fix if it was last used a couple of miles away from you current position.*Map data is a little out dated and free updates are not available.*No Battery.Garmin C330 is a similar product in the same price range. I think that's a lot better in almost every area."
1,so disappointed!!!,"Bought 3 for Christamas gifts. 2 bad so far( only 3 weeks ). One often freeze. One cannot be powered on at all. Ask magellan for exchange. They asked me for original reciept. There are no orignal reciept at all, since it's an online order. Don't buy it. Waste ur money & time!!!!!!"
1,Magellan 360,"It stopped working after using it about 10 times , can't find any help on their web-site, and no one answers their phone numbers in their manual. Except the one number to India and they say they don't handle this product anymore. At least that is what I think they said???!!Frank Malowski"
1,Overpriced junk - cant update the maps,"I have had this product a little over a year under the premise (as stated by magellan) that the maps could be updated. They even sent a data cable for connecting to a pc. Unfortunately, they have discontinued the product and there is no procedure to update the maps. I never would have bought this had I known the unit could not be updated. I don't believe I will ever buy another Magellan product."
2,Cute But Not What I Expected.....Mine Just Sits In The Box,I am sooo thankful for the speedy delivery this company gave me....The item is cute and practical and pretty easy to use. I am just used to the Navigators that work while being unplugged.... This one does not work that way and so I thought that it was broken or something....But when I emailed the company that sold em the navigator. They were polite and let me know that its not broken....It has no back-up battery...I was sooooo disappointed.... I didn't remember reading that anywhere.Its Cute but not what I expected..... Mine just sits in the box!
1,"Had potential, but didn't live up to it","I bought this unit a week ago, and put it right to the test. Overall design, look, and feel of the unit is nice. Unit began to have problems with freezing up during route navigation, and the only way to reset it is to unplug the power source. Often times, when powered back on, it will shut itself off 3-4 times before working again. This is generally not a good thing to do while you're driving on unfamiliar roads. I e-mailed tech support, but then decided that I shouldn't need to be e-mailing tech support about a product I've owned exactly one week.Good quality and engineering is something that should be an expectation that companies are held to. For my money, I'm giving Garmin a try. As a pilot, I often use their aircraft GPS units, and hopefully their vehicle navigation units will live up to the same reputation."
3,Good unit if you live in a place that does not change,"I have this unit for over a year now, and I find that over all it is doing what it suppose to do most of the time which is to bring me to the location I want. Unfortunatly, I leave in the Phoenix AZ area which is booming, and new addresses roads and highways are added daily. It seems that NAVTEQ which supply the maps to magellan, does not bother to distribute map updates to the roadmates. Not to the 300 and not to the 360. For over a year now, I am asking for an updated map and no responce. I guess my maps will be obsolete shortly ..."
2,No good!!!!!!!!!!,First of all it takes too long to acculy find a animal and then u have to trach it dow nand then on your first shock you have to shoot it in the right spot tot accually kill it and not just shoot it and then just let it go. I suggest dont buy it.
2,Too much information,"While this book is definitely thorough, it is far TOO thorough. The author seems to have been unable to engage in editing. While Kenton's life is interesting, the biographical information is buried in an avalanche of verbatim news reports, press releases, concert announcements, and reviews. Was it really necessary to include the complete text of some many concert announcements, including contact telephone numbers? Do we really need full text reviews of so many concerts?Although some of the quotes from fellow bandmembers are illuminating, it appears that William F. Lee merely wanted to talk to all former bandmembers- some of those quoted only appeared with Kenton a few times. In addition, many times Lee only lists information, providing little context; there are almost day-by-day accounts of various tours, listing personnel and pieces played. With all of this information, it is too difficult to follow the thread of the biography."
2,The Stategic Bond Investor - Disappointing,"Although this book contains good information on types of bonds, yield curves and things that affect the bond market and interest rates, I found it disappointing. To me, it was overly wordy and sometimes repetitive. At times, I felt that I was slogging through molasses. My biggest disappointment was that it did not get into the specific bond investing actions that an individual like myself would take using the information presented. There was nothing about things that I was interested in i.e., bond laddering, bond mutual funds, convertible bonds, when to buy or sell short, intermediate and long term bonds, etc."
4,"Boring, but useful","Reading this book was so boring it was like... Well it was like reading a book on strategic bond investing. That being said it had a wealth of information. The price I got it for used was well worth the Fed speak chapter, and the detailed explanation of the various monthly economic data (employment, housing starts etc). Also each chapter has a summary that is helpful if you are just scanning the book. For non bond investors it is quite good to have for reference."
5,Cute flip flops!,"These are really cute flip flops; they are well made and most importantly, very comfortable. The multi-color is great for summer and I would definitely buy a pair in another color too."
1,Disappointing,"This turner has a comfortable grip handle, a sturdy nylon surface, and a nicely angled edged. But all the design advantages are outweighed by one flaw: the nylon melts. And not only that, the nylon started peeling into my food! I would not recommend at all."
4,So good Indeed,Yes I ordered the Strawberry 24pack and it was very good indeed im thinking of ordering the Vanilla as well so I will either have 24 or the 48 to have as a meal replacement or if I wanna pack on some more pounds..Ensure will not disappoint cha!
2,Shipping stopped,"I ordered monthly shipments for my dad, for one year. Three months into the ""subscription"" I got an email from Amazon saying the product had been discontinued. No mention of whether it was all flavors or not, no suggested substitutions. If the product was for me I wouldn't have minded so much, but this was a gift subscription."
3,an ok trowel,"This trowel is better than a marshalltown, but it's no Rose. The metal for the blade is thinner and seems to be a better quality steel than most. It's balanced pretty good, and pretty light which is important when your laying 1500-2000 brick a day.I have two complaints with this trowel though. First, I bought the leather handle model and after a few weeks the handle split in half and basically fell apart in my hand. If you use some sort of butt bumper it might not do that. So I just bought a Rose leather handle and put it on and it was great after that.The other complaint is that it the blade is cracking where the shaft is welded to the blade... and so far it's still holding up, but it's soon going to fall off. I've had it about a year.All in all it's a decent trowel. But my next trowel will be a Rose, unless they make some changes."
2,Interesting book but WAY over my head,"I am an experienced Access developer. I was looking for insight into how Jet works, especially in aspects of replication where I was encountering corruption. The book was WAY over my head."
1,Burnt up,Burnt up in 2 months. About 2 weeks past the return window - Bummer. Thought Milwaukee built a quality tool. I have a Porter Cable that's 6 years old and still running...
5,as good as they say it is,"I am a one man cabinet making shop. I have gross revenues of 150,000.00 a year..I work long hours and enjoy my work..the Milwaukee 3 1/2 hp router is installed on a horizontal table..I use it to make moldings for my installs. Since I use all local hardwoods. It has plenty of power and runs very smooth. I also use it for making picture moldings. It is a great router and the price is right! I think it is a little big to use free hand..but it will work freehand on large areas very well. Like working solid tops. Thank you Milwaukee."
2,broke in 30 days,after very light use with small bits the router wouldnt turn on. Used it maybe 30 times building a table for it. Now after talking with milwaukee Im shipping it to them with tons of frusrtation to ship at their cost. The height adjustment is getting stiff to dont think it will last either or just clean it every time. Then whats the sense in using it. Im in the camp of wishing I bought a different brand
1,Waste of paper...,"Nothing in the book is new. It is full of old ideas, written with New Age babble and hype words plastered liberally throughout the pages to make the book and it's self-glorified author seem ""cool"".By the way - 15% of this small, 178pg book is made up of pictures - not ""software dynamics"" diagrams or charts, but eclectic pictures of the author's own creation - more-than-not, having nothing to do with the book."
5,The Secret Horse,"this book is the best!! I love how the author makes it feel like your there, with nikkie. she saves a horse saves proporty shes amazing ihave read this book at least 9 times i own it and highly recomend it"
1,Margarita hummingbird feeder,"Although very cute the hummingbirds could not figure out how to use this feeder. I have 15 or so feeders in my yard of all different kinds and shapes and once in a while, they do not like a certain kind.This is one of them. I tried painting the feed holes red but it still did not work. They were attracted but I think the nectar sits too low. Wish it worked as I really liked the idea of hanging a margarita glass for them to drink out of."
1,"Great looks, very poor performance","The hunter fan looks great, it provides a good stream of air, and it seems to have a very solid built. Unfortunately, it is just looks. After 3 months of owning it, using it two or three times per week, for about 3-4hrs each time, the highest speed started making a significant vibration noise in oscillating mode. A couple of months later the vibration extended to static mode for highest speed and at this point - 8 months after starting using it, every mode except static lowest speed vibrates. Very disappointing considering the price."
2,"Looks nice, but loud","I would not recommened this fan. Maybe because it's made of a metal it vibrates while oscillating. For the price, I would have expected a quieter fan."
1,blows... LOUD,This fan has lots of power and would be great for someone who is deaf. I cannot use this fan. Way too loud.
5,"Nickel-finish fans have issues, but black model is perfect",I bought a black and a nickel-finish fan at the same time. The black fan has been 100% great but the nickel-finish fan made a loud clicking noise when oscillating. I returned it to Amazon and was issued a replacement. The replacement has the same problem and now I have to return that one. I am gong to replace it with a black fan. I would not buy the nickel finish model.
1,GIVE A BREAK,LOOKS GREAT PLUG IT IN WOW WHAT A PEACE OF ____. DONT BUY IT !!AFTER RUNNING IT 6 HOURS OSCILLATING FAN MADE STRANGE NOISE SO ISHUT IT OFF WAITED A WHILE THEN TURNED IT ON NOTHING FAN DONT ROTATE HEAR BIZZ SOUND .DONT BUY IT A HEAVY PEACE OF JUNK AND A RIP OFFBUY SOMETHING ELSE TRUST ME OH TRUST ME ITS GOING IN THE GARBAGERIGHT NOW . I ORDERED A PLASTIC 16 INCH OSCILLATING FAN AT LEASTI KNOW I WILL HAVE YEARS OF SERVICE OUT OF IT !! I REALLY HAVENOTHING NICE TO SAY OR WRITE ABOUT THIS FAN DONT BUY IT .......
2,Marks up surfaces,"I bought this about 18 months ago. It works fine, but I discovered that its feet leave black marks on hard surfaces. I was unable to to remove them, short of refinishing the furniture."
1,My 3rd one just died...junk!,"I have had three of these desk fans that have lasted me, in total, three years. Once every year or so, they die. The low speed setting barely turns the blades (that was the first fan's fate). Then the gear (a cheap plastic disc) that controls the oscillation died (the fate of fan number two) which made it ratchet noisily at the terminal ends of each pass of the fan.This fan has the appearance of quality, but the reality of junk. Why build a fan that looks like a well-made machine, when they could have just as easily gone ahead and built a well-made machine?! Curious.Will NOT be buying another from Hunter. I've heard their quality control has gone steeply downhill over the last few years anyway."
2,Too Fast,"The construction, quality, and design are excellent. The fan is much louder than most fans... too loud. The fan runs smoothly, but it is loud due to the amount of air it is moving. It seems to have three speeds, the slowest speed being turbo-jet. At the slowest speed, the fan oscillates back-and-forth every six seconds. It is giving me motion sickness. It might be great for the corner of a bar, but it is no good for an office."
1,Not the 7th Gen product I'm used to buying retail,"This will teach me to ALWAYS read the reviews for even the simplest product. Turns out, this is not the same quality TP sold in 12-roll packages at the grocery store. This paper is ""unquilted"" and rough. Now I'm stuck with 48 rolls of abrasive toilet paper -- not the best situation after childbirth. Product description should be more specific to differentiate it from the other 2-ply TP offered by Seventh Gen. Very disappointed and won't be ordering again."
3,green TP,"It's 2-ply, so don't expect supper soft silk. It works fine though. My only gripe is how expensive it is, but I buy it because I'm manager of a Co-op and this is what the house wants unless I can find something cheaper that is still ""green"""
4,I've bought this toilet paper for a few years now,"This is a good product. It works well. The rolls last a long time and a lot of paper comes out on one roll. I love that I can buy it in bulk and that the paper is shipped in an eco-friendly manner. Their is not plastic used to ship, handle or wrap this toilet paper. The paper is a bit rough. I'd like it softer, but if that mean using harmful chemicals or not using recycled toilet paper than I'd rather live with this just fine."
2,Passable quality. Small rolls......,"I'd hoped these would be closer to what I've bought at Costco. They're not close to that quality. Pricing is decent on Subscribe and Save. I'll definitely use these but won't buy them again. For the same pricing Costco is better quality and larger rolls. This toilet paper is VERY crispy and reminds me of the paper towels a person finds in the gas station rest rooms (I kid you not). Unless you want to scrape your sensitive places with something akin to fine sand-paper, this isn't for you. I wish I hasn't bought it and shall suffer through it (and my husband's gripes) for about 40 more rolls!) Of course; someone I know may need TP for decorating purposes and then I will happily donate to that cause."
2,Not Soft Enough,"As much as I like to incorporate environmentally responsible choices into my household shopping, this toilet paper is not worth it. It's just not soft enough."
2,"Too thin, too rough for my body.","I like most of the Seventh Generation products, but I cannot use this toilet paper--it causes itching and irritation for some reason. I have had to go with something else. I also, like another reviewer, do not put out Seventh Generation when I have guests. It truly feels like you are in a gas station in the middle of nowhere. It is also too thin to do the job and that defeats the purpose of using less."
3,Environmentally friendly TP,"Although this TP isn't as soft as I would like, it does the job and does it without irritation. I am hoping that after using this product longer we will get more accustomed to the feel as it is better for the environment."
4,Great HD with depth of field,"I purchased this to help build up my 3d library. This is not a ""pop out at you"" 3d video for sure, but the vivid colors and high def image are enhanced with a depth of view that provides a more dynamic image. This DVD is filmed in HI so every camera shot is full of tropical scenery. I frequently describe my 3d TV as the difference between looking at a picture of a fish tank (2d), and looking into a real fish tank (3d). I almost forgot to mention that there are also some very attractive women in bikinis which made this purchase well worth the price."
2,It does not worth the price,"If you are looking for a 3D Blu-ray showing models in bikinis, this is not the one. The 3D seems to be a conversion and not native 3D. If you are interested on this product, just get the regular (non-3D) version. I got it to see how the sport illustrated models look in 3D but they look exactly as they will look in the non-3d version of the product. To ensure I leave an objective feedback about this 3D product; here are two examples of very good 3D Blu-rays: 1. Resident Evil: Afterlife [Blu-ray 3D] and 2. Step Up 3D. Please note I'm not saying the two movies previously mentioned are good movies; I'm just saying the 3D on these two movies is AWESOME."
3,A good Introduction to ABAP/4 but lack of Depth.,This book provides a good overview for someone who is a beginner.But the book doesn't treat ABAP/4 comprehensively. Many topics need to be explained in detail. --- Avinash Mulye. Price Waterhouse management Consulting.
3,A Good General Introduction but a bad reference book,This book is a very good general introduction to the basic ABAP concepts. However there appears to be a serious lack of depth to the book as well.( I now know how to generate a report but how do I change the Character pitch in the middle of the report ??? )A behind the scenes explination of what is happening while not strictly useful would have been more helpfull in provding a better understanding of the overall structure.(The architecture appendix being too limeted)CD examples were also very basic without any inherently useful programs being present.Very little mention was also made of implied standards in SAP.On the whole the book was quite disappointing.Maybe a 2 book pack with more depth would have been better.
5,Works great!,"Even for those younger people who are starting to need a little odor protection, this is a safe and effective product. My daughter has had it for three years and still has the same stone. She uses it after her baths and showers and it keeps the odor away. Definitely cheaper, and so much safer than other chemicals. Takes a while to get used to wetting a deodorant to put it on, but it dries really fast too, and then you have protection that works!"
1,Waste of money,Although this hose reel may look great it leaks. Tried to fix it with no luck. This item is useless and a mess.
1,Not durable,"This body of this item is solidly built.However a small round plastic pin about 1/8"" in diameter activates the spray when the handle is squeezed. This pin broke and the product is now garbage."
2,Eritrean Food?,It seemed puzzling that Eritrean food consisted of Ethiopian Spices and Italian recipies. Is there nothing original in this cook book. If I wanted Italian Food or Ethiopian Food then I would buy those cook books. The book is an excellent introduction of Eritrea.
2,Sorry,"The book was clearly thoroughly researched, but I found the plot and characterizations to be extraordinarily tedious. Each ""plot twist"" was practically accompanied by a blinking light alerting you to it. The relationships felt awkward -- I don't buy that the sisters were all that close -- and the voice shifts less than convincing. I don't want the characters to be 100% lovable, but I found few redeeming qualities in any of the main characters -- in fact, my favorite people were the ""whoremonger"" and his family. I definitely don't recommend this book."
5,The Story of Two Very Different Sisters,"I am still shaking my head at this one. It did not end the way I thought it would. Not to say that it was a bad ending, it wasn't. It was actually pretty ingenious! The twist in the story was not obvious to me at all. In fact, I was quite shocked by the outcome!This is the first book I have read by Mary Sharratt, but it won't be the last! Her writing is very simple, easy to follow and yet, very engrossing! I loved every minute of this story!I won't bore you with plot points, because obviously you can read that in the description section. But I will say that this novel was quite unique and very enchanting. I fell in love with the characters, and found myself very interested in where the story led them. If you like historical fiction, romance and mysteries, you will love this book!"
4,"Delightful and sinister, it's a fun read!","Toss this one into your beach bag, but remember to bring along some sunscreen! You will not be able to pack up and leave until you finish this intriguing and delicious book. The mystery is good, the characters are interesting and likable, and the love story is tingly!"
5,really love it,Had to find a way to get water to the birds because deer in our area monopolize the birdbaths. This is perfect. It it beautiful and has a sturdy hanger. That's great because we have lots of windy days here. I love the shape and the color and the solid copper. I can't wait for it to weather. I am veyr happy with this purchase and I recommend this product to others.
4,Alkaline Trio/Hot Water Music - Split,"How can 2 bands that are so great release a bad album? The answer: they can't. Some of the best new material from both of these bands can be found here. Alk3 and HWM each of 2 brand new tracks on here, plus they cover each others songs. Alk3 covers the HWM track ""Rooftops"", and they do a phenomenal job of it. More upbeat than the HWM version, the track loses nothing from the original while being adapted to Alk3's characteristic sound. HWM take on Alk3's hits ""Radio"" and ""Bleeder"". The HWM version of ""Radio"" is very similar to the Alk3 version, merely a bit rougher along the edges. Great job there. Now on the other hand, the HWM cover of ""Bleeder"" has been transformed from pop-punk, to a sullen, acoustic rock song - and its done to perfection. The only complaint I have is that its so short. These 7 songs will definitely leave you wanting more from both bands. 8.5/10For reviews like this and much more, visit bigtouchin.com"
4,Pretty Good. How good? Pretty Darn.,"This record has some of the best Alkaline Trio stuff to date in my opinion. The first two tracks are new and unreleased, and sound similar to their latest release on Vagrant records, ""From Here To Infirmary"". Their third track is an excellent cover of Hot Water Music's ""Rooftops"", from their Some Records release titled ""No Division"".As for Hot Water Music, they cover Alkaline Trio's ""Bleeder"" from their Asian Man Records release, ""I lied my face off"" CDEP, as well as ""Radio"" from another Asian Man Full Length release ""Maybe I'll Catch Fire"". Of their two previously unreleased tracks, ""God Deciding"" is pretty much one of the best hot water songs I have heard, but the other song, ""Russian Roulette"" in my opinion was a little weak.Overall, this record was great and I am looking forward to others in the Jade Tree split series."
3,Lacks a routine,"Though this book does contain a comprehensive list of stretches, it lacks a solid routine for their use. The author states that you can improve your game in 10 minutes a day, but it would take quite a bit longer than that to complete the 30+ exercises. The only routine offered does not incorporate the exercises into a daily routine."
4,"Good Value, but",Only problem is they leak a little each and when you have ten it can add up. What I do is point slide opening down and slicone edges to make a better seal. This helps stop dust build up in tracks. Amazon has a good price on these
5,Versatile Blades,"These PorterCable recip saw blades are good at cutting things other than metal. I have used them successfully with my cordless PC Tiger Saw to cut through very tough woods like oak and aged, time hardened rafters in the attic of my 1930's vintage home. The fine teeth produces smooth cuts in plywood and pressed board, too. They are great for cutting through nails on the ends of studs during demolition work. That way, you can remove the wood without ruining it and reuse it in the job later. I always carry a pack of these blades in my tool tote."
3,An odd but ultimately disappointing page-turner,"I kept this book on my wish list, and finally found it at a local bookstore, based on a recommendation in <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, but wound up with quite mixed feelings about it. It's like <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</i>, but as written by Douglas Adams and about toys instead of toons, but not quite as good.I had no trouble maintaining interest, and laughed out loud at several of the passages, but the mystery plot ultimately disappoints. It's not something you can deduce or follow, like a good mystery, but is something you must wait to see revealed. The twists are as surprising to you as to the main characters, because there are no clues as to what happened.I can pass the book along to friends and recommend they read it, but it doesn't leave me wanting to read more Rankin."
2,"After the title, it is all downhill.","The title is great, and there are intermittent moments of wonderful humor. But, on the whole, not worth your time."
1,Suitable for young nerds with no social life.,"After comparisons to Terry Pratchett and Douglas Adams, I was expecting great things. I was vastly disappointed. The humor was crude and probably only funny to pre-adolescent males. The plot is full of holes and the writing is wooden. I can't imagine how this book ever got published."
5,A detective story with a twist,"I admit that I bought this book based on the title alone, and was delighted to find it a very clever, funny, and unique novel. It reminded me of Christopher Moore's writing, except in Moore's books, there is an unusual creature in a usual world, where here it's the opposite.Great wordplay, interesting themes, and some laugh-out-loud passages. Once you accept the premise of a world where toys and nursery rhyme characters live (they prefer to be called Preadolescent Poetic Personalities) and have their own society and hierarchy, it's a fun ride to the unexpected ending. I highly recommend this book - it's as good as!"
5,Great Book!!!,"Ths is an ""outside the box"" hilarious book. Combined with the witty humor, it is a must read for anybody."
3,"Amusing, but not what I expected, exactly.","I'm a big fan of comic fantasy. I hadn't read anything by Robert Rankin before, so thought I'd give it a try. This title pulled me in immediatley. I mean, Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of The Apocolypse? I read it and while I was mildly entertained, it wasn't quite what I expected, even after reading the blurb. I did enjoy it. Why only 3 stars? Well, while there are parts that move slowly in any given book, I found myself plodding through a few chapters. The humour rescued it, in the end. It is worth reading once, at the least. And for all those fuddy duddy's out there who say, not for kids warning...sexual content...blah blah blah... It's rather miniscule compared to something as racy as say, that piece of junk titled 'Scarlett'.Have a care people... Read this book and enjoy..."
1,Not worth the money-- even if it's free,"I bought this book because I liked the sound of the premise and I liked the absurd title and book cover. It is difficult to put into words my feelings about this author's writing. It isn't horrible, or unimaginative, it's just very tired and tiring. He's not Douglas Adams, even though he seems to try desperately. He's not dry and witty like a Monty Python skit (his writing might be more tolerable if it were the length of a Monty Python skit).His writing reminds me of a high school sophomore's attempt to be cool.Based on the book blurb, I guess I was expecting something edgy and fun-- kind of a Hunter Thompson meets Chuck Palahniuk meets Warner Bros cartoon. The best thing about this book is the title."
1,Well-written but unlikeable,"I wanted to like this book. It is in a style and genre that I generally enjoy a great deal. But... there isn't one single character in it I liked. Eddie Bear is probably the nearest it comes, and he's sweet but one-dimensional. Actually ALL of the characters are, including Jack, the main character. Most of the characters in the book are toys and nursery rhyme personas, so it could be said that they ARE one-dimensional, but that doesn't make me like them any better. Language is used beautifully in this book and the style is unique and challengingly interesting. Unfortunately it cannot overcome the unlikeable and flat characters and rather gratuitous grossness that crops up from time to time."
4,Nursery is no place for kids,"Behind the mask of this hilarious book is a revelation known only to a few people in the past. Just as Toontown has its dark secrets and evil Toons, Toy City - where nursery rhyme characters reside - has its share of Looniness that would lead the Brothers to wish they'd written all the nursery rhymes, and not just the Grimmest ones. This book points fingers like no other brave soul has dared. (For example, despite a blatant attempt to make it look like an accident, it has always been well known among insiders that Humpty Dumpty was indeed murdered.) The Apocolype may be coming, as the title suggests, but I have advice for all my loyal Bunny-Eating friends: do all the wabbits a big favor and bite off their heads first so they don't see the rest of it coming!"
1,Unable to Read,"I suspect you need to already be a fan of Robert Rankin to read this book.The blurbs for this book indicated it was funny and had nursery rhyme characters. I'll grant that there were nursery rhyme characters in the part I was able to read - the first 5 chapters. Funny, amusing - very subjective words. I was not amused.This book did not draw me in with characters or plot. The pacing was too slow. The ""amusing"" writing style was repetious, dull and heavy-handed. The dialogue? Silly but not funny.I was looking for something more along the lines of the Jasper Fforde books - silly, witty, fast-paced. Alas, it was not to be.After 5 chapters, I just can't go on."
1,Not Impressed,"There are some decent exercises on the DVD, but the same information could have been presented more efficiently and in less time. It is not complex information, and I would rather have a book with simple diagrams instead of watching everything slowly unfold. Filming for the DVD seemed secondary to the running of the clinic. It seems that the 60 boys and girls are bored.I bought this video for my wife who is a high school lacrosse coach. I knew before purchasing that this item was likely overpriced, but after viewing... I would say it is worth maybe 1/4 what I paid, $59 I think. My wife does already use many of the concepts presented in the video. She is familiar with the phrase ""dynamic warmups,"" which make up a large portion of the video (different terminology). Buy a book instead that covers speed drills. It will save you some time."
3,Getting Back on Track,"This is more like it for Diana Palmer. The last couple of books have been, to me, a real wasted effort. I felt that Ms. Palmer was really selling her audience short by not lining up the story or building characters that you cared about. This was more like old style. Not all the way back, but a huge improvement. Also I did not notice any gaps in the story or minor contridications in editing that seemed to plague the last couple of books.I have read all of her books and the last few it has just been because I wanted to see what happens with the characters and I felt that she was just cranking out books without much thought. I guess after so many 187 page romance books, there is only so much you can do.I did enjoy this one though and did not feel short changed or confused at the end. And I am glad to see all the Hart boys married."
3,"Musically interesting, but .....","My personal benchmark for listening to ""The Execution of Stepan Razin"" is the 1967 Angel/Melodiya LP record, which exhibits a far more dramatic presentation of this powerful work. The conductor (Polyansky) on this CD seems to be in far too much of a hurry to get this finished; and the rapid tempo and frantic instrumentation detracts from the drama for me, despite the very excellent vocals. I would recommend that you listen to the sample provided here by Amazon. If you like the fast tempo, then you will be very happy with this performance. I also was a bit disappointed with this Chandos CD audio as it sounded on my B&W 802 speakers; maybe a different speaker selection would give the sound more color and fullness."
3,King Edward,"Product not able to be put on a flagpole outside in our part of the country. Nice to have around and drape over a couch. Edward III was an ancestor (like many others in this country) so it is nice to have something to remember him by. Price was right however, which should have given me a clue about it's potential durability."
1,Product not as shown,Flag I received had the head of the snake missing and the tail was colored green to match the grass. Poor quality and not as described or pictured. Would not recommend to anyone.
3,Flag,My husband enjoys flying this flag in our neighborhood. A way to make a political statement without being to conspicuous.
3,Thought it would have a Non-Slip base,"I really like the design lines of this soap dispenser so I ordered it. Unfortunately, this dispenser lacks an anti-slip base which is necessary for my bathrooms which have free-standing basins only (no counters - house was built in 1929). The melamime soap holder seems sturdy, but the pump part seems to me like it would break easily. Without a non-slip base, it will be broken within a week so I have to return it."
2,Broke first drop,Bought this items because it was supposedly unbreakable. First time it fell off sink it broke. The ceramic ones I've had have been more durable. Dissappointed.
1,Absolute Trash,"I got through about 50mins of this. I had to stop before I became physically ill over all the lies in this. I'm not sure who this guy is, but I really want to see him hung out to dry for the liblous crap in this.I actually cant wait to tell my friends about this. I want to know all about this supposed ""director"" and creator of this film that knows soooooo much. Then I will make it my personal mission to make sure he never produces this type of garbage again."
1,Unsubstantiated Slander,"So few facts. So much hyperbole. I'm saddened by the high rating. The producer/director imagines that some marginal left-wing poet/editorialist, Frank Marshall Davis ,is Obama's father and that this is somehow significant. He implies that Obama is a mole for a worldwide communist conspiracy. Possibly worth watching for the hilarity alone."
1,How desperate the GOP really is.,"We received not one, not two, but three copies of this dreck in our mail today. Don't be dumb enough to actually encourage this cynical garbage by paying the clods behind it, you can probably find it in any number of dumpsters around your neighborhood - for free!I seem to recall, not too long ago, if someone had produced this kind of slanderous crap about the President, the jingoistic right-wingers would've been crying for you to be strung up for treason. But now that it's not 'their' guy, they're all too eager to do everything they possibly can to defeat the man.Or at least drag his name through the mud in the worst possible, most patently false way imaginable. The minds behind this filth should be ashamed of themselves - but like everyone in the tea party, shame is a quality they lack entirely."
4,There is Enough in Here to Make me Question Obama's Real Motives,"Although I have to take what was presented in this video with a grain of salt, much of what was presented is interesting. There are enough shady facts to suggest that the story presented here, although perhaps not 100% accurate, may very well be plausible.Just the people with whom Obama has chosen to associate with and take mentor-ship from should be of concern for middle-class Americans who hope for economic stability and opportunity. I hope Americans are beginning to realize that hope is still FREE. You don't need to buy hope with your vote for Obama - he can't deliver hope for America (the last 4 years are proof)!""When the character of a man is not clear to you, look at his friends.""-- Japanese Proverb""The character of a man is known from his conversations.""-- Menander (342 BC - 292 BC)""the free market - it doesn't work, it has never worked.""-- Barack Hussein Obama II"
1,why is this on amazon at all,"Unsubstantiated, intelligence-insulting, and absurd. What a shame this is offered in amazon prime. You'd think someone was paying better attention over there than to offer this fantasist, paranoid rubbish up for 'entertainment,' let alone 'documentary,' which at least carries the implication of truth. There's no truth or authority here, just another desperate sideshow."
1,"Propaganda, pure and simple","This is false propaganda, pardon the redundancy, pure and simple. This is a fantasy of the most vile kind. I'm not surprised that it's been made available at no cost. I can't imagine anyone paying for this slander. The content cannot be verified because it is not true. It is false. Lies. Unbelievable!"
1,Unwatchable,"An employee sent me a link and I downloaded it. This kind of stuff makes me afraid for America. Not because people would have us believe we have a black communist Kenyan president who is hell bent on destroying America.Because we have more than a handful of people who believe this stuff. Truth, fact, science, rational thought, understanding, empathy, inclusiveness, compassion....all seem to be vanishing before my eyes.Because I am a firm believer in freedom of expression I will not criticize Amazon's decision to sell this rubbish. This is America and people have the right to express the most idiotic and hateful and dishonest things and even make money in the process.I am so afraid for those almost one hundred people who gave this vile and sophomoric drivel five stars. Shouldn't they be declared incompetent?"
1,I laugh at reviews like yours,"Pros -Great laughsHas the form of a documentary in a comedy, brilliantReally this is a terrible DVD and if you can't see that I have no hope for you at all.I recommend this ""documentary"" if you're one of or a combination of the following:CrazyIlliterateRacistXenophobicor a Birther (synonymous with the rest really.)"
1,Garbage,"I can't understand why people constantly look for pretend stuff to be scared of when there is enough in reality to fill my nightmares forever, like the growing number of people who believe this ridiculous crap."
4,Gina Jones,I thought this film was very interesting as Joel Gilbert states on his website that his publication is credible and truthful. He did a presentation to the National Press Club in Washington DC and swears by the oath of the Journalist's Creed. This is worth the time for other objective investigators to investigate and collaborate their findings with those findings portrayed by Joel Gilbert. Will their findings agree with his? We owe it to our country to find out.
1,Really bad.,The simple fact that they select a narrator that sounds something like the president made me distrust the film from the beginning. And I know from personal experience that a person can share a lot of features with someone unrelated to that person. I would have like more real evidence and less speculation.
1,Get REAL,"The so called documentary is so poorly done that anyone who is looking with an open eye..can see all the flaws and mistakes. Lets put a few facts, some name calling, racisim and a lot of supposition together and there you have it."
1,right wing propaganda and a fraud,this is typical paranoid insane giberish from the deluded right wing of US politics. sane people should avoid this at all costs. not suitable for watching without a tinfoil hat on.
1,swiftboat swill,"Zero stars - typical conservative rubbish, cut from the same mold of ignorant malcontents that brought you Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in 2004. They can't win legitimately so they invent and market fantasies based on idiotic, hysterical, delusional and depraved distortions that are an affront to an advanced society. What's so remarkable about it is the number of so called intelligent people this resonates with. God help us..."
3,"Interesting, Possibly Fictional","No one wants to see Obama on a fast train out of the White House more than I do, but much of what is presented here seems like it's as undocumented as the illegals the Marxists want to make citizens. I thought it was possible that Davis could be Obama's dad until I saw photos of Obama's Kenyan half-brother, who looks a lot like him. All-in-all, I'd have to say that much of this movie is interesting conjecture, at best."
1,The right is at it once more.,"This dvd is a right wing bag of horse s**t! The same thing was done on Bill Clinton. I give this dvd a one star, but it should get a -one star. You want to see a lot of books come out, put Mitt in office. But you will not have money to be able too aford them!"
1,This DVD will make a nice plant coaster on my patio.,Just more of the same idiotic birther blah blah blah.....One thing it does demonstrate is that there are some really deep pockets out there trying to defeat the President of the United States.
1,Racist crap,Complete crap. Underlining racist bull only a idiot would beleve this DVD . This DVDs twisted logic is the same stuff you see on concentration camp denial sites.
1,But I thought he was a Muslim from Kenya...,"Well, I've got to say. People do know how to throw their money away. I received this video in the mail and we watched it at work. Conservative to Liberal, we were on floor laughing at the poor production value, the re-used shots, and the horrible fake ""Obama"" who narrates. Get this, apparently when you put pictures of two african-americans next to each other, you can say ""oh look how his lips and nose are big, just like that guy, he must be his father"".This video should be filed under comedy. We were at least entertained... kind of like watching someone incompetent explain the existence of bigfoot.8 thumbs up!"
1,disgusting,"This is filthy, despicable stuff that Amazon should be embarrassed to have on its play list. This film isn't just inaccurate, it's intentionally and maliciously misleading material designed to defame the President of the United States."
1,Lots of laughs,Complete utter horse poo. Facts are few and in between while the story telling is not even beginner's level. Has the conservative movement fallen this low? Pity
4,Watch it before commenting,"If you watch this in it's entirety, it is hard to dispute much of the factual evidence submitted, of which there is much more than in any Michael Moore crockumentary I've seen. Just the information about the Ayers family, Michelle Obama, Valerie Jarret and CPUSA is very enlightening. Living in Chicago much of this was known already by me, but is likely unknown to most outside of Chicago.I would say watch it and you be the judge - don't rely on some one star review from someone that hasn't watched it stop you.Whether FMD is the father or not, which seems very plausible, isn't really as important as the information about Mr. Obama's associations with shady characters and what he actually did from leaving college to becoming president. Where else has that time period been covered in the media?Also, wouldn't one wonder why all his academic records have been sealed?Also available on Netflix streaming if you have that,"
1,Pure propaganda!!!!,"This movie is pure political propaganda plain and simple....Small movie for Small minded people!!!!It is another attempt to make it seem as though there was some big conspiracy dating back to the 60's about making some ""illegitimate"" baby the first Black President 50 years later...."
1,Junk and Garbage,"A fictional account of the current president's life being pawned off as truth. Told by Birthers. More like grifters. Why is this on Amazon? It should be in a garbage bin with all of the other Birther, conspiracy theory nonsense. Embarrassing.Maybe you guys could do a '2 Fer':Dreams From My Real Father: A Story of Reds and Deception/ Birth of a NationPackage deal of racist driven drivel. If I could give this swill negative marks, I would."
1,Election-Year Propaganda,This is the product of those who will say or do anything to win the election. The intention of the book is to provide those who want to hate Obama with new reasons to dislike him. And to cash in on a niche that no self respecting author would stoop to.
1,Wow...Really,"What I would like to know is where did they come up with the millions of dollars to send millions of copies of this propaganda to people all over the United States right before the election. I received one myself. After watching it, I jumped on line and started investigating... There is zero proof...just wild speculation. Mr. Gilbert should be ashamed of himself.Are people really that gullible? ... If this is true, I have some beautiful swamp land to sell you..."
4,"Documentary on Obama's formative years, twisted as those may have been","This is an interesting documentary that attempts to inform those interested in our current president's formative years as to how he got the way he is--what was his early background, his interests, etc.--and why he is a socialist and hater of all things British and American. Some aspects of the video were a little difficult to follow, but that may be my fault since I was a little fatigued when viewing it. The problem with this and all similar documentaries is that they are essentially preaching to the choir: those who buy it probably weren't going to vote for him anyway, and those who drank the Kool Aid and blindly follow would not even be aware there is any controversy, would not buy the video, and would vote for Obama. All just part of the ""dumbing down"" of America that resulted in Obama's re-election. God help us all."
5,"IT ""FITS""","I AM 82. BROUGHT UP AS A BELIEVER, NON-SUSPICIOUS, THOUGHT OSWALD KILLED KENNEDY, ON AND ON. AFTER 4 YEARS OF READING THE OBAMA IDYLL, I CLICK INTO THE FRANK MARSHALL DAVIS PATERNITY. IT ""FITS"". (I ACTUALLY BELIEVED OBAMA WROTE THE ""DREAMS"" BOOK AND WAS SEMI-ENTHRALLED ALL THE WHILE I WAS READING IT; HOW DUMB WAS I.......) WE NEED TO DNA OBAMA TO FIND OUT FOR SURE. BUT THIS F MARSHALL DAVIS SCENARIO CLICKS INTO OBAMA'S DISMISSAL OF HIS HALF BROTHER AND THE EMPTINESS BETWEEN STANLEY ANN DUNHAM AND ELDER OBAMA, AND THE EASE-OF-USE OF THE NAME ""BARRY OTERO"" AND SO MANY THINGS. BUT OF COURSE, THE ORIG ""DREAMS FROM MY FATHER"" IS A TOTAL WORK OF FICTION. GETTING AWAY FROM THE PATERNITY BIT, THOUGH, THE MORE IMPORTANT STORY FOR AMERICA IS THAT OBAMA IS A COMMUNIST. ALL OF US NEED TO PRAY AND WORK OUR WAY OUT OF THIS....AYE-AYE-AYE."
4,to much information to just pass off.,There are to many connections here to just write this film off as propaganda. It may very well be that Obama's real father is not from Nigeria. A simple genetic test can prove this film wrong. I bet that genetic test will never be done.... would be to revealing.
1,right wing lie during 2012 election,another weak and pathetic attempt to lead people into darkness of lies. Not worthy of viewing. Inaccurate and very easy to see contradictions. To prove that Obama Sr was not the father was weak and nothing more than high school gossip. Very much a propaganda tool aimed at low-information and low-intelligence voters.
1,This is purely constructionist propaganda,"There is little to no objectivity in this material... Just another ideologue fitting what little data they can find or make up to support their agenda. Bottom line is, they don't like Obama. This just proves desperation to me.Go to reputable and non-partisan fact check and debunking sites like factcheck.org, politifact.com, and snopes.com as the antidote to this type of nonsense. People, these story-spinners are wasting your precious time and energy. You only have one life, why waste a second on this type of refuse."
1,"""Malarkey""","I just read another review that said ""Wow! Really?"" That review pretty well sums up this steamy pile of cow dung. This is the documentary that one GOP congressman said was ""totally true?"" Peeyew. This documentary stinks. Just a ton of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that have no basis in fact. This movie should be listed under science fiction in your movie categories. I would love to know who dreamed up this drivel. My guess would be the Koch brothers but that would be an entirely different set of conspiracy theories. Don't waste your time on this movie. It will destroy your brain cells."
1,Seriously?,"Really? Well, at least they can't say he isn't an American citizen anymore. I guess they are just throwing everything against the wall until something sticks. I'm from Texas, and even the conservatives here would think you're an idiot for falling for this."
1,Partisan hatchet job,Utter rubbish. Not worthy of being used as toilet paper. Unfortunate that anyone would allow themselves to be rooked by this type of claptrap. Only people with swiss cheese for brains could not see through this flimsily argued pile of camel dung.
1,Ancient (political) Aliens,"If you like crazy conspiracy theories you might like this video. It's more or less the political version of ancient aliens. The CIA, communists, ties to the 9/11 hijackers, sub prime mortgages it's all here. I'm surprised he didn't get credit for faking the moon landing, alien abductions and the Kardashians. The main proof for his ""real father"" is they look more alike. Oh and the age spots by his eyes (watch out Morgan Freeman.) And supposedly nude pictures of his mom taken by the ""real father"" because no one has heard of Photoshop. Good for a laugh and a coaster."
4,hapless leader,must be a hoax. how would any vetting service miss obvious links not to mention clues that could have led to proving what hardnosed conservatives have thought from the outset of his rise
1,Garbage,"One star for this ""documentary"" is a generous appraisal. If zero were an option, that would still be generous. I pray the only reason this film is viewed is for entertainment purposes; even then, the shock value wears off rather quickly and this becomes a dull agony."
2,Interesting but not believable,I wanted to believe this story but it is quite a stretch to believe this account of BOs formation. I still am suspicious of him but this account is just too much to believe.
3,Fair to Mediocre,"I found the series of tapes to be a bit flat and not all that useful. However, Lerman and Turner have such thick accents that the series is worth a listen, if only for the humor of it all."
3,LONG...AND...ARDUOUS,It took me FOREVER to finish this book. There are other A+ manuals out there that boil the test topics down a little better. This book goes into so much detail that it is very difficult to rationalize going through a second time for review.
3,Great for Hitch fans,This is a great set for a fan of Hitch but don't expect it to be the greatest set of his films. I do have one question--why did they have intros by Tony Curtis? As far as I know he has nothing to do with Hitch. Still a great set.
5,GREAT TAPE DISPENSER,"This is the best tape dispenser I have ever used.For some reason the office supply companies don't want to stock or even offer this relativerly inexpensive tape dispenser.All they want to seel you is the really expensive and complicated ones that, honestly, don't work very well.The beauty of this dispenser is that your grip on the dispenser controls the friction on the roll and makes it realy easy to apply the tape - and especially, to grip the tape tightly when you want to cut it off.I bought a bunch of them."
5,Good group Bible Study,"Our Sunday School class is studying this book. The author puts the book of Luke into context with cultural and historical background. The book is well-organized, with an introductory chapter that lays out his plan of study. There is plenty of reference to other parts of the Bible. He has good questions throughout each chapter to stimulate discussion."
2,Not too bad,I bought this hoping that it would be a comfortable pair of shoes. Yes they are comfortable but not as comfortable as my generic 20 dollar skater shoes. Quality product no doubt and it is stylish too but not worth my money. If you have spare dollars to waste buy this. 63 dollars for this is ridicilous...
5,Amazing!,"I love this product! It is so incredibly easy to clean - it redefines the nonstick pan category. Everything I have baked in it so far comes out effortlessly, perfectly shaped, with no pre-greasing necessary. It works very well for creating frozen deserts too. The down side is that the wells are relatively small compared to a regular muffin pan. I was also concerned about a distinct plastic smell while baking but the pan was perfectly intact. Make sure you follow the manufacturer's usage guidelines as to maximum temperature and using a baking sheet underneath."
5,smart book,"This book is lifechanging. Its message is simple. See reality exactly as it is. Once you do that you become much smarter in different areas of your life. The majority of self help books are about ""positive thinking"" which is great skill to have. This book is a refreshing change and has allowed me to combine realistic and optimistic thinking. Just by reading this once you become a more genuine person. Must read for everybody."
1,O GOD why?,"First I want to say that this is the only season of the osbournes that I watched all the way through. (I tried to watch the second season but I hated it after watching the first episode.)So why the negative score? Well it was when I realized just how much money they were making by doing nothing! I wouldn't have a problem with that if they gave some it back in some way, but they kept it all!Anyway, its not that OZZY doesn't deserve it its just the rest of his family dosen't deserve it.Kelly is a brat, Jack should be dead right now(drug overdose), and Sharon is a money sucking leech of a wife.I'm not going to say the show wasn't funny. But I would feel better about it if I was laughing with them not at them!!!!!!!!!To finish of I'm glad that the show is mostlikely dead. And I hope it is never tried again!(HAS ANYONE ELSE NOTICED A PATTERN IN THERE LUCK LATELY? JACK ALMOST DIED, SHARON ALMOST DIED, AND OZZY ALMOST DIED!! SO STAY A WAY FROM KELLY. lol)"
5,THE OSBOURNES TAKE ON THE WORLD!!!!,"The Osbournes have been massivly popular over europe, north america, australia and evrywhere! i can't wait for this DVD to come out! It sounds so great and the special features sound awesome, and for the first time America will be able to see what the UK and Canada have been seeing and what America has been missing out on! The no beeps version! Thank you"
3,"Good information, but a little outdated","Good healthy info here, but the information should be updated to include the internet age!"
3,Crowded Together,"I have the 1976 spiral-bound version of this book. It appears to be mimeographed or possibly photocopied. Maybe printed from typewritten copy, but I'm not sure. The book is well organized into 30 lessons, starting with the easiest beginner techniques and progressing through intermediate to difficult. I like the thought that went into the lessons and into providing the user with a spiral binding, so that the book lies flat. However, I feel that the dark type, with very little white space on any page, creates forbidding-looking pages that a user might be reluctant to enter."
3,Good Reference Material,Material that was there was excellent. Approximately 40 pages were referenced but missing from one of the volumes. I was able to get a friends 1997 Deville up and running with it. Could not have done it without the information in the book. The missing pages cost me hours of extra work.
5,Historical amnesia,"I've been an avid reader of Hancock's work for some time. He used the term ""historical amnesia"" in a documentary. Underworld explores what should be fairly obvious, that when the ice age glaciers melted, sea levels rose, obliterating civilizations that lined the ocean shores. However, archeaologists for many reasons (including a lack of funding) have confined their research to mainland structures. There is still much to learn about unrecorded, ignored or misinterpreted human history.I am still reading the book. For newcomers to Hancock, be prepared for personal recollections and extremely detailed analysis and reporting on the cultures he encounters. Well worth your time."
3,Good Idea's but over written.,First I am a fan of Graham Hancock I really liked many of his books like Heaven's mirror and Fingerprints of the Gods. That being said this is a interesting book but could have been told in about 400-450 pages. I did gain insight and liked chapters on Malta but the book turned from enjoyment to work. I am a person who MUST finish a book when I start one and this book got a little tough twords the end. I would only buy this if your a Hancock fan. Try Fingerprints if you have never read his work.
3,"a little ""dated"" but still funny","An enjoyable collection of old TV skits. Most are still funny, although they do seem a little slow-paced compared to comedy programs today."
4,Fantastic! But...,"You really can't go wrong with this DVD. ""Not Only...But Also"" is one of those beautiful moments in time with pure comedy genius. Cook and Moore are just as perfect together as Martin and Lewis or Laurel and Hardy. My only complaint is that there is so much footage out there that is NOT on the DVD. I know that most of the series was recorded over, which was the BBC's policy at the time, however, I know that John Lennon was on the show several times. They do have ONE of his scenes on this DVD (the classic ""Deaf Ted, Danoota and Me""), but ""Dan the doorman"" is nowhere to be found, nor is ""Good Dog Nigel"" and several other poems of Johns that I believe were even on the same show that they featured him on the DVD. I know the footage wasn't recorded over because it's on YouTube, so why isn't it on this DVD? I think it's time to put together a new package. Other than that, this DVD rocks!"
5,"BUY THIS BOOK, You will not be disappointed!!!","I bought this book and read it over a two week period and passed my exam with flying colors. I can't begin to tell you how awesomely well this book prepared me for the exam. I scored almost 900 out of 1000 from reading this book and doing a couple of practice exams, nothing else just the book and practice exams. The chapter on monitoring and remote access is awesome. There is nothing wrong with this book. This book is a hole in one, a bulls eye, a pefect compliement to your experience and know how. Just make sure that you read it cover to cover. To pass this exam follow these simple steps.1. Read this book cover to cover2. Take a few practice exams. Make sure you get an 800 or higher on your practice exams, that will give you wiggle room just in case the test proves harder than you expected.3. Take your real test. That's it nothing else.If you want to pass your exam... Then use this book."
5,Much better than stock horn on 2007 Jeep Wrangler,Installed this on my Dad's 2007 Jeep Wrangler. Install goes smoothly once you decide on mounting locations for the 2 horns. Sound is much more substantial than the single stock horn.
3,"I liked this because of the dogs, not the gardens","""Dogs in the Gardens of the Rich and Famous"" is probably a more descriptive title for this little book, but that's a minor distraction; the dogs are the stars of this book. The photos are without exception excellent and the accompanying text is good, especially when it focuses on the dogs. It was comforting to see the odd mutt featured in these pages, many adopted from Humane Societies. The passages about the pleasures of being with dogs while in the garden, particularly the ones pertaining to a dog named ""May"", make this book special. The book is printed on quality stock in a pleasing layout."
1,Poor Product Representation from Sprout House,"The Sprout House Organic Sprouting Seeds - Oat Groats 1 PoundThe label & product info state that these are sprouting seeds. I kept wasting time trying to sprout them, but they only went bad. - I called the Sprout House, who DID acknowledge that they are not for sprouting,- despite their web site(at least-at that time), indicating otherwise. The person I got on the phone, basically - couldn't care less. She just said - to eat as is, or soak & eat. I might, if I enjoyed the taste of cardboard. Really appears to be a disreputable company who I would not trust to order from, in the future.I have found an ethical company with quality sprouting products. The name is ""Sprout People.""[...]Most of their products are organic. They provide a wonderful educational service, which also includes several instructional videos. Can't beat them!"
4,Outstanding!!,The portable dvd player is just outstanding. I use mine in my room to watch movies on. I have no problam seeing the screen and the sound is great. I would reccommend this product to anyone who is willing to buy it.
1,Horrible,"I wish I knew this warning before I bought this. Because the place I bought it from off amazon, won't get back to me about returning it. So Im stuck with it.WARNINGWILL NOT WORK WITH VERIZON PHONES!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This movie was BORING !,"This movie was a waste of time and money, poor acting and a boring plotcentered around a drunk and his wife."
1,The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd,"Very disapointed in the way this was shown...I love Colin Firth, but believe that this was a very depressing view of the story and didn't like it being played out like seeing it on a stage. Thought they could have done a better job. It is really a waste of time to watch."
3,Not for the hard of hearing,"If you have a hard time hearing then this movie is not for you. The sound as well as the photography itself are not the best by a long shot. I had to listen so hard to try and hear the dialogue that I lost interest in the movie. By the end of the movie it dawned on me...I just needed to turn on the subtitles and read as the movie went along! The bonus movie that went along with this story (Rainbow) was a little on the ""racey""side."
5,"A darned good book, if you pay attention.","Ian Anderson, whoever he really is, is a great story-teller. He's probably borrowed half his tales from floor gossip, but so what? The point is that casinos have become aggressive in going after people they think can win. You have to utilize psychology and human foibles to keep from being targeted.This book, and its predecessor, ""Turning the Table on Las Vegas"", will show you how. You won't use everything the author talks about. Don't try. Read what he is talking about, not what he is saying, if you get the drift. If you do, and you read Stanford Wong's book, you'll win in the shadows while the Ustonites get kicked out of casino after casino. I know. I do."
1,Single Str8 for #1.. at the cut-out and clearance bin,"its not to be mean and i was supportive back in the day in 2005 but you keep going as if you're this big mega superstar. Sing live and lets see if it sounds just like Single.. or are you another Britney Spears/Ashley Simpson? I'm sure you have other talents.. but jeesh its annoying when these bands and artists that suck act like they're big and that they're so loved.. like the PLASTICS from Mean Girls with L.Lohan. ""That's the thing about you plastics.. you think everyone is so in love with you but in reality... ""how many singles are u gonna release? I havent seen your singles chart anywhere in the world. It's like Mariah Carey's Charm bracelet album.. give it up and move on. This is why i don't like you..you've got an ego bigger the the Sears Tower..."
4,Good camera.........had trouble with xD card,"I bought this camera because of the large LCD. In general, I am pretty happy with the F650, and the price was right. It takes great pictures with very little lag between shots which is a big improvement from my last camera. I purchased an xD card at Circuit City, they only sold Olympus cards and I figured the brand didn't matter. I found that about 50% of the shots saved to the xD card were corrupted and garbled. So, while on vacation I bought another xD card, this time a Fuji brand, and it's been working fine ever since. I don't know if I just got a bad card or if you must use a Fuji card in a Fuji camera.The only other thing I don't care for is that it's not ergonomic and I always feel like I (or someone else holding it) will drop it. I use the wrist strap every time I pick it up."
5,Excellent camera,"Big 3"" screen. Menu selections not complicated. Screen scene modes really make the pictures. Not difficult to learn how to make professional-looking pictures. All buttons easy access while holding in your hand."
2,big and bulky,This camera is just OK....the size is too big (width) and bulky.I ended up buying another camera to replace it FUJIFILM - FinePix 10.0 Model: J250 BLACK SKU: 9283223 ---much better sleeker design and better resolution.
2,slow,"No viewfinder option which is handy in bright daylight.SLOW to take pix.My Fuji 4440 was far smaller, far faster and far easier to use."
1,save your money,This DVD is disappointing and condescending to children who are fairly robotic. Grogan makes side comments to adults and the music does not fit activity. There are much better options out there. The aerobic component is not well organized or sustained. I will not use this in PE classes or classrooms in my school.
3,Good for the first month,"The case definitely helped organize my wallet- there's a place for everything but the checkbook. However, if you have too many plastic cards for the cardholder, you might want to think twice. I've had this case for about 2 months, and a few weeks ago, the lining behing the cards started ripping, I'm assuming because of being so full.Now that's either a sign of thin lining fabric, or of too many credit cards- but my wallet shouldn't be the one punishing me for that."
1,Needs to increase the workload .................,"She is an OK songwriter and has a sweet voice, but it's not strong enough to justify recording yet. The only answer is much more singing than she's doing now."
1,Total disaster and outdated,"Terrible book. A dead end as far as theory or practice go. Like a chinese meal, it's ok while it lasts, but you will quickly need more. It doesn't help you make progress. The numerical methods are antique. Best books are Nefci and Wilmott. Nefci for probability theory and Wilmott for applied math. Don't buy this garbage, it impedes progress."
1,"Put Away Your Credit Cards, Girls","A huge disappointment! The quotations used in the editorial reviews compromise the bulk of the ""literature"" of the total book--this book is that useless! The introduction is the most informative part; the rest is one big ego-fest for the author. The drawings are cute, however, but do not compensate for the otherwise emptiness of the book."
4,"Not Bad, if You Like This Sort of Stuff","I have read about half (so far) of Mr. Paxton's 83 edition of this text (NTC Publishing Group). I plan to buy it as a reference to use in trying to learn Deutsch. Good coverage of the grammar rules. Well organized and easy to read. Some pronounciation information would improve it. Also, maybe a bigger glossary. Use with Berlitz and a dictionary."
4,Every Palm VII owner with a laptop needs one of these,"Don't travel with the cradle, and don't wait until you return from a trip to synch with your laptop. Just roll up one of these and stick it in your laptop case. This is especially useful for Palm VIIs, which can't use the version of PalmOS that supports synching through the IR port.This cable does not have a synchronize button. In order to use it, connect the cable, turn on your Palm, press the HotSynch icon, and press the LocalSynch icon.Remember that leaving your Palm in the cradle or leaving this cable connected to both your Palm and your computer will put an extra drain on your batteries, so you should unhook your Palm as soon as you finish synching."
4,a fine effort in what may be the last kinks album,"certainly not up to the level of their late 60's output up to the lola album which many consider the end of their classic period. this album rocks out with hard hitting riff based songs highlighting dave davie's underappreiated guitar skills. there are at least a couple of classic songs on this disc including scattered, and hatred (a duet). i remember this album being in my heavy rotation for several months after i bought it when it was released. i also remember hatred getting quite a bit of radio play. i know ray and dave have had some tough times recently with dave's stroke and ray getting stabbed in new orleans. i hope they get back together for at least one last hurrah. do they have another arthur or village green in them? i'm hoping they do."
5,Special vacuum tools for close cleaning.,I purchased the dustless 3 piece vacuum accessory package. These tools will help me to clean into small area's of my Pellet Stove. There are area's that these tools will really come in handy for proper cleaning in vital parts of operation of the pellet stove.
1,Wrong Accessory,"This is advertised on the page of a Ash Vac (Cleva EAT605S Ash Vacuum ). We purchased them together, but when they came, they would not fit the hose of the Cleva Ash Vac. Not sure how, but I got stuck paying return shipping to Amazon?I can't comment on the Accessory Package, but looks pretty good from what I could tell."
3,Hit and Miss,"Can't say I'm a die hard Ramones fan, but this CD is hit and miss. Some of these renditions are just painful to listen to, and others haven't changed a thing from the original song.I like the Zombie, Manson, and Metallica tracks, and the group that did ""Suzie is a punk rocker"" by speeding it up. I was really disappointed by the Offspring track."
2,Not Worth It,"When i first heard about this CD i thought it would be interesting, which can be good, but this CD is horrible. After listening to it once i hated it, there are truly only 2 good tracks on this entire CD. Joey is rolling over in his grave as people play this CD."
4,Kiss Fan Review,"This review is for the KISS fan's looking at this. If your a diehard Ramones fan, U2 fan etc then I'm not going to pretend to know if you'll like this. It's a proud moment for KISS. Their's is the best. You'll also like every song other than Manson's and Waite's which are just too dreary and dorky.It's a great intro to the Ramones if you are fairly unfamiliar with their work. Let's face it, radio never played them and still don't. How many tributes albums are comprised of so many artists who sold so many more records than the group they were tributing? If you like this, don't worry about splurging for the Ramones anthology, it's worth it."
4,Skeptical At First...But Surprised Me In The End!,I recieved this CD for Valentine's Day from my girlfriend. She knows I love the Ramones. When I first looked at the CD and examined the track listing..my heart sunk. I love the song Blitzkreig Bop...but would I like Rob Zombie's version??? But after listening to the whole CD...my opinion changed. This CD pays tribute to the greatest punk band of all time. Except for a few misses (Marilyn Manson & Pete Yorn)...the CD is pure gold. I would defnitly recomend this to anyone who likes the Ramones.
2,This is not a punk rock album,"The only good cover is made by Rancid, because is the only real punk rock group on this album. The Offsprings and Green Day's songs are a copy, not a cover; they doesn't put their own style, so they sucks!I think that the U2's cover is very good too"
4,"fun, fun, fun...","i bought this cd just because rooney was on it. they're gonna be big i tell you! big! keep an eye out for them in the future. they rock, and so does this cd."
1,THIS CD BLOWS,"This is by far the worst CD that i have ever heard, if you like the ramones at all, you would want to hurt almost every band on this cd with the exception of rancid, and the offspring very badly. the other bands on this cd murdered anything that ever was good of the ramones. i have no respect for any of those bands. marilyn manson ruined a great song. U2 did the same. if there was the option of giving 0 stars i would, even negative. this isnt a tribute disc, this is torture to the ramones, the ramones fans, and anything that is, ever was, and ever will be punk. this is a tragedy."
3,"Solid, creative, fun Tribute disc","Rob Zombie's enthusiasm definitely comes out in his cover of 'Blitzkrieg Bop'. U2 sounds good when they aren't making U2 music. I think KISS has the best cover of all them, sounding like a perfectly oiled rock music machine. Marilyn Manson provides a soft cover of 'KKK' and Shirley Manson slows things down with her beautiful voice effectively capturing boredom. Everyone else does a pretty good job as well. I can say this is one of the better tribute discs I've come across (is that saying much?)."
5,Great Tribute CD if you listen to it for what it is.,"You cannot listen to a tribute cd the same way you would a normal album. You cannot expect the songs to sound anything like the originals. The entitre point of a tribute cd is for other artists to put a twist on the original song. If you listen to this cd for what is it. (A tribute album) you will be happy. If you expect to hear the Ramones when you listen to this album, no you will not be happy. This album has great intentions with the proceeds benifiting the Lymphoma Reseach Foundation. It's a win win situation with this album. A great album to have around."
1,A Sad day for music,"... I only liked three songs on this cd(tracks 11-13).Come on people when The Offspring have one of the best songs on the cd you know something is wrong.You know Joey and Dee Dee must be rolling over in there graves first this and then Marky and the other guy sell the rights for Blizkrieg Bop to a cell phone company. This is a cd for kids that buy a ramones shirt from Hot Topic and think there punk, would like. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ... !"
4,Bueno,"Muy buenos featurings con otros artistas, Luis Fonsi, Hector El Father, El Gorila, Tony Dize y lamentabemente con Don Omar también.. El DVD está bueno también."
5,Great Vacuum,"Very powerful vacuum that removes ashes quickly,and cleanly,without any ash escaping into the air.The vacuum arrived quickly,and in perfect condition.Another great experience with an Amazon purchase"
5,"I love the MU405WS Courgar Ash Vacuum, Winter Scene","The Dustless Technologies MU405WS Cougar Ash Vacuum is such a nice vacuum to have! We love it, it sucks up all the ash inside the pellet stove, and makes work less of a hassle. Thank you Amazon for sending it to us!"
2,Tedious Bickering,"I don't have a problem with with occasional bad or outrageous behavior. It makes a story funny and interesting. But these books feature pages of tiresome, predictable, unimaginative bickering: between bully Max and classmate Chloe, between Freddy and his sister. I especially dislike the unidimensional characters: Bully, Rich Girl, Brain, etc. This book also had teasing about girlfriends and such - do we really need to get into that?"
1,Disappointing,"After reading the rest of the reader reviews/recommendations, I couldn't wait to pop this baby into the ol' VCR. What a disappointment! I kept checking the box to make sure I had the right video! I hated it! It went way too fast (I am a relatively fit woman! I do the Crunch and Tae-Bo videos without a problem)and some of these moves should not be done that quickly. His constant prattle was annoying beyond belief. i even thought of doing the video once more with the sound off just to be sure it was as bad as I thought it was. And, I paid 3 times more than I normally pay for my workout tapes, twice what i would pay for a dvd! that was the capper, of course. Sweatin' to the Oldies has got to be better than this."
3,Hints of Morrison To Come....,"An early Grant Morrison written arc from the Legends of the Dark Knight series. It's helped immensely by Janson's style of art, which fits the brooding dark world of Batman quite well, and shows early signs of Morrison's tendency to write everything as if he's high on drugs. Probably because he is."
4,Five stars except!!,"Five stars except!It was great items in term of heavy duty material used in it. Very well welded and bended, the picture is not the same of the item I was received I know that before I purchased the item so it was not surprising thing to me. It was shipped and sold by [....] they could not estimate the right price for the international shipping when I checked out so they sent me an email to add some money for the extra shipping cost to Saudi Arabia and I agreed. They were great with the time it got me with in 7-10 days with UPS.I will give the item curt 13220 five stars but because one of the fitting holes was not directly fit due to miss calculated measurements in the factory of Curt. So you need to force it in which I did, or have it filed or something...My car was VW Touareg 2005.Saleh"
5,Fantastic message for your children!,We absolutley LOVE this book. It sends a great message to children and especially young girls. You can do ANYTHING--and let nothing or no one stop you. Esther Morris was a hero and we appreciate her contribution to women's rights.
2,Random,"This DVD is very random and just kind of jumps from song to song with virtually no instruction at all. The only instruction is usually ""watch so & so and do what she/he does"". A lot of the times, the kids look confused and not happy.I was hoping for an instructional DVD that would teach dance, incorporate different steps and move progressively.If you only want your child to move randomly with no sense of direction, then this is probably more of what you're looking for."
2,Boring. They seem vaguely 1990s.,"Out of the 100 postcards, there are about 15-20 that I'm actually interested in. Many of them are just boring. Not as good as I had hoped."
2,Self justifying all the way through!,"I haven't finished; just can't muster the necessary enthusiasm. I'm so tired of the constant excuses and self glorification. When I finish ""Girls Like Us"", maybe, I'll dip back into it!"
1,A preview of some intriguing movies,"A sales preview film that is a synopsis of movies from Full Moon Entertainment. However the editors did a sloppy job of splicing the movies together to form ""nothing of value"". I am not sure it is even good for a shopping reference film as there is not enough meat to make a decision. They do refer to classics, such as ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death.""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"
4,A good reference,"I admit that I'm an information junkie and over the last 15 years have acquired quite a few aquarium plant books. Yes, this book is rather dry, but its strong point is giving you researched facts that will tell you why your tank may not be balanced and what to do about it. Although I don't agree that using a soil-based substrate is the best approach to an algae-free tank, Ms. Walstad has presented research data in an easy-to-understand format that isn't readily available in other aquarium plant books. If you want to be inspired by photos, get one of the coffee table aquarium picture books; if you want to figure out how to own one of those tanks, I'd recommend this book."
5,An excellent book for the low-tech beginner or enthusiast.,"I had heard a lot of buzz about this book online, in forums, articles, interviews and videos, so I decided to see what the fuss is all about. I read the book cover to cover in a day and I'll read it again soon as I'm sure there's information in there I'm yet to fully comprehend. Simple enough for someone seriously thinking about starting up a low-tech planted tank, but with enough detail for the serious enthusiast with a chemistry or biology background. This book will be my bible in setting up my next tank."
5,A GENTLE CHARMER,"As long as you have the proper expectations, you'll love this video. No flashy special effects; just a gentle story about appreciating nature from an artistic point of view, with a nice music soundtrack. Nothing to scare the little ones, which doesn't mean your older kids won't like it. Both of my kids (8 year old daughter and 11 year old son) and I enjoyed it."
3,Good but less,"An average hose, not as good as the old hose it replaced, when the old hose was new. Better than the one I bought a few months ago at the hardware store for approx. the same price."
3,"No kink hose , KINKS","Apex 8605-130 NeverKink 5/8-Inch-by-130-Foot Heavy Duty Reel HoseI got these two NO KINK HOSES as my other hoses drove me nuts with the kinks, the only thing i can say about these are, they are long and don't leak at the faucet but they do kink, not as bad as my other ones but for a NO Kink hose ( ha) i would expect no kinks at all."
2,Good product but too short,"This is a quality hose, it does what a hose should do. However, the 25 foot is too limiting to be a good product. If you want a hose, minimum size is 50 feet, and for some people that is too short as well."
1,SUCKS!,"i got this hose as a present to my children instead of a pool. they loved it. untill they used it. it kinks like crazy and there is a terrible paint job, also it has cracked so many times. we decided to get rid of it and got one for 9.99 called the ANEX REM.THIS HOSE SUCKS!JUST KIDDING! hose is great! works amazing! never kinks!"
2,Dissapointed,"The main reason I purchased this hose was to replace my old one after hearing about lead in hoses from Good Morning America. I thought this hose was safe for my kids to drink out of but once I placed the hose on my reel I saw in the inside of the cover ""not safe for drinking"". The hose is also too stiff that it is very difficult to unravel and wind back. I'll be looking for another replacement."
3,need heat,This hose comes tightly wrapped in a container. Until the hose is completely unraveled and subjected to summer heat it is not very flexible and does kink. Afterward it is less subject to kinking. Neverkink is a misnomer.
3,heavy hose and it kinks,bought hose because it is not supposed to kink which cuts off the water flow and requires backtracking to find and release the kink. it kinks especially in hot weather like any other hose. it is heavier than a plastic hose and harder to drag around the lot. more expensive than lighter weight hoses which never wore out so if this one dies not wear out it does not make it worth more money . the good points is it is longer and has solid brass fittings.Apex NeverKink 5/8-Inch-by-130-Foot Heavy Duty Reel Hose #8605-130
3,Apex JustOneKink,"I just used it for the first time today and it seems to be a good quality hose, but ironically, my NeverKink hose had a kink in it - right at the output end of it, the end *without* the black plastic cover - right out of the box before I even removed the packaging. Because of the hose's weight and because it still works, it's not worth shipping it back, but I'd never expect a hose called the NeverKink to arrive pre-kinked. Just a bit disappointed."
1,Unsatisfied,"I purchased this hose four months ago and use it every weekend for common household chores. I was very disappointed to discover last weekend that this hose has sprung a LEAK. Four months and I already need to replace it? I would hardly call this a heavy-duty product, I recommend you look elsewhere for your hose requirements--"
3,OK..,"I bought these shoes for my boyfriend. They look great at first, but they became scuffed very easily. It is very hard to get them looking how they were when I first got them. Love the style though,"
5,Great casual/business shoes,These shoes look and feel great. They are a bargain. They can be used for formal or casual events. They're great.
3,Structure isn't everything,"This book is only mildly amusing, and while the circularity of the plot resolves itself quite nicely, it seems the fragmentary nature of the book is structured to encompass the author's personal diatribes against animal testing (severe) and fat americans (actually amusing, and interesting given recent news). The home decorator in Hell is also amusing, and could perhaps be read as social or political commentary. While there are snippets of good writing, the justification for the main suicide is present but vague. And why the words in All CAPS?"
4,Straight and solid,As always Leecraft puts out a great product but if you use this insert on a TS2400 like I did expect to spend some time getting it to fit. You have to trim dowm the bottom side on one sid eso it fits flat and like most of them some rounding around the edges so it drops in. Worth the effort.
1,Customer Service from Leecraft,"I ordered this part and it doesn't fit the saw -- not Leecraft's fault -- mine, as I ordered the wrong item. Problem being that I called them three times and never received a return call. Returned the item and won't be ordering from Leecraft again."
4,"not his best, but still a great joint","This is a solid album, good lyricism, he's still all about Detroit, there's no annoying tracks you have to skip over, and hey, it's hard to go wrong with DJ Premiere. But it doesn't seem to have as much emotion in it as an album likeDeath Is CertainIf you're already a fan, buy this. If you've never bought a royce CD before, choose an older one.Fun fact! A little after Royce and Primo were working on this mixtape, Royce got sentenced to a year in jail for violating his parole. 3 or 4 months later, the judge agreed to give him a work release. Which is why this joint took so long to come out."
2,Magna Doodle is better,"I was surprised to find Doodle Pros everywhere and no Magna Doodles in stores, so I thought, why not, I'll get a Doodle Pro. I promptly returned it. Obviously they do not use high quality magnets in the Doodle Pro as they do in the Magna Doodle because the lines are not nearly as dark or as satisfying to make. The stamps are equally disappointing and leave only faint marks. The eraser bar is also very hard to drag across and does not fully erase unless you drag it back and forth. I love my Magna Doodle it is obviously a much higher quality of toy, dark rich lines, easy erasure. My only complaint is that the stamps fall out, but we always manage to find them. I would also mention that the age range seems too high to me. My two year old loves this and I love it because it is a good way to practice scribbling without mess."
5,What's not to like?,"I bought these for my daughters two years ago. They are now 3 & 5 and they still use it all the time. It's great to bring while traveling and for times when the kids want to draw in the living room. Very well made, no problems with it."
4,fun toy but screen not erased cleanly,"My 2-years-old son loves the toy. But the eraser doesn't work very well. After just one week's use, the screen can not be erased cleanly. A friend has one as well and the screen becomes quite dark after half a year."
1,Palm serial adaptor,"Be aware this will not work with newer Macs that utilize USB, even though they have an available printer or modem port."
1,Please let us have the HD Widescreen version,"I bought this from Germany, Region 2 in order to get an English version that was HD and Widescreen.The description on this one says narrow screen and standard definition.A huge shame since it was originally filmed in HD and was a very attractive movie to watch... saw it on the SciFi channel (oops I mean the ScyFy channel).Good picture, but standard / narrow would pretty much ruin it."
2,product not as advertised,"my garage door like all others takes two (2) springs to open the door. you advertise your product as: National Hardware 7690 Garage Door Extension Springs with Safety Cables, Black, 25-Inch by 150-Pound . you use the words extension springs (plural) and safety cables (plural). so i am expecting a set of two (2). when opening the box i only got one (1). is this false advertising or just a mis packing at the factory?????? i waited 4 days to repair my garage door and now i must still wait longer. please send me a second spring because it is owed to me or send me another and bill me for it. but please, send your customers what you advertise or change your advertisement. a very unhappy customer.Mr. Edward David Sr."
4,Good Peasant Food,"I must disagree with the reviewer from Amsterdam. I think this is quite a good cookbook. Though, if you're expecting Nouvelle Cuisine or modern fusion cooking, you will be disappointed. Slovak cooking is, at its heart, peasant food: hearty, filling, and unsophisticated...but good! Pirohy, dumplings, stuffed cabbages, pork dishes, poppy seed and nut rolls, and mushroom soup flavored with sauerkraut juice take me back to my Slovak grandfather's kitchen (my grandfather used dried wild mushrooms in his soup). My one criticism of the book is that, aside from the brief introduction, it contains no information on the cultural context of the recipes. Some personal anecdotes from the authors, and a bit more on the food traditions of Slovakia would be welcome."
3,buy a GPS with SIRF star III chip,"Pros:- It was the cheapest PocketPC with GPS in the market when I bought it a year ago.Cons:- no built-in Wi-Fi. Need to buy a SDIO Wi-Fi card for internet access.- the GPS signal reception is very poor.- The navigation software Navman SmartST doesn't have TTS (Text-To-Speech). For example, it only announces ""turn right in 0.1 mile"" rather than ""turn right on Main Street in 0.1 mile.""I would recommend a GPS with SIRF star III chip for much better signal reception."
5,One of the Best books on vedic astrology!!!,Five stars all the way! I initially got this book from the local library... I must have read it atleast 10 times before I knew I needed to add it to my permanent collection. This is perhaps the BEST book to have if you want to start learning the basics on vedic astrology. This book will not confuse you with technical stuff on astrology... I have read 10-12 books by now on hindu astrology and I know how tough this subject is to grasp. This book forms a good foundation on the 'whys' rather than the 'hows'. I highly recommend it.
3,Not the easiest to use,"Difficult to locate what you want to see. Maybe it's just the periscope thing, but this toy proved to be too much of a bother to be fun for my son. It's sitting in a toy box."
2,I am not sure,"I don't feel any difference when I rub it on my shoulder. the bottle is so drak, I thought it is full but in when I noticed it today it was almost gone."
2,chunk.,"so this thing is a nice idea, make a hard case for your palm pilot to keep it pretty. the bad thing is, the case is super chunky and mine cracked easily. it's better to go with a leather case for these, or just a plain old flipcover."
5,WE LOVE LIL' CRITTER,"A perfect book for reading just before tucking your toddler into bed. A great book for fathers and sons to read together and an absolutely heartwarming book that all kids and parents can relate. We give this book as a gift. It really encourages reading before bedtime. Our other favorite book is ""Going to Sleep on the Farm"" by Wendy Cheyette Lewison."
4,Just go to bed,the used book was in very good shape..and I received the book 5 days after i purchased it on amazon.com.
2,Not a Sleeper.,"There are other books on the subject that capture a child's interest better. Passable, but nothing to rush and buy."
5,Excellent,"Cute book, entertaining, hold's a child's interest.I recommend all Little Critter books--good stories, lots to look at on each page."
1,Not Worth It,"I have something similar to this - and my son played with it in total, maybe, 15 minutes. Invest your money into something else."
3,limited time use,"This was given to me. My son did used it at a very young age, and it did make him smile and keep him quite occupied. As others have mentioned, it has very little traction, so once a child starts kicking harder, it gets knocked across the floor. It doesn't play a wide variety of music, and the music it does play is quite irritating to a parent's ears after repeated usage. He lost interest in this toy as soon as he could turn over, etc. I recently passed it on to a younger baby. One plus-it folds up, so it's good for a house (such as mine) where there isn't a lot of room for baby things which tend to be large. Also transports easily."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"We bought this for our daughter and we regret it. It was a complete waste of our energy to put it together and a total waste of money. Our daughter loved to kick so we thought this would be perfect since it was easy to store and take with us. It is so light that she would kick it over. We tried putting a blanket over the legs and laying her on it, but it still came up under the blanket. Then we tried putting it against the wall, but we got nervous when it would hit the wall and start to fall forward. We were afraid that it was going to fall on her. We used it for about a week and only under strict supervision. Please don't waste your time or money on this."
2,Not thinking with his brain,"Clint should be embarrassed. He made this during his ""hot for Sondra Locke"" period, which pretty much dooms any movie.Never mind ""Go ahead, make my day"" - the big lines here include ""only with humans"", and Clint's definitive exposition on the proper condiments for a hot dog.The resolution of the killings (never mind the hilarious impalement) is completely out of character. It completely contradicts his character's beliefs from the earlier movies.At least ""The Dead Pool"", which is a parody, features the killing of Jim Carrey."
5,WHAT A GREAT READ,"I found this book facinating. First of all, I love New York and am sometimes sorry I relocated to the West Coast. But, back to the book. Who would have guessed that so many events occured in one city in one year? Mahler gives it his all from the Yankees, the mayor race, the blackout to the Son of Sam.It reads like a good novel. You hate to put it down. The book makes me want to subscribe to the New York Times.Whether you are a New Yorker or not, you'll enjoy this book. GO YANKEES."
2,Stay Away !!,"Don't get me wrong, this book have some good questions that might help you, but don't except to pass the test entirely from reading this book. First of all the editing is absolutely horrible, there are numerous mistakes, questions repeat themselves a lot and sometimes the same question have a different answer contradicting a previous similar question. I didn't have a lot of time to study for the exam so I bought this book, I passed the test but trust me there are tons of subjects that this book doesn't cover. You can go ahead and buy it but prepare to get very annoyed."
3,Much of Common Sense,I purchased this audio hopping to get some new ideas and new strategies but much of the information on the audio was common sense.This would be great for someone new to the music industry.
5,Improving and growing,"Numb3rs is a fabulous series. The characters are believable. The writing is excellent. The stories are appropriate, though sometimes incredibly so. I don't want to give away story lines. I want you to watch! Start with the first season, and watch them in order. You'll know exactly what I mean. Don't like so much gun play? Look away. It only lasts for a short minute. And yes, people die. Some good, but mostly bad. Suicides happen. Bad guys get caught. Good people smile at the end of the day."
4,Good choice for a little light reading,"This wasn't my typical choice of reading, but I really enjoyed it. Some folks say they couldn't find the humor in it, and people that don't have the occasional (or frequent) neurotic family member from their childhood probably won't find humor in it. Lapham is my hero. And the passive aggressive behavior of the main character reminded me of some of my family's elders and what could happen if we took their leashes off."
5,"Utter, complete excellence","What can I say? This has got to be one of Williams' finest scores ever. Although the CD has some of Leslie Bricusse's repulsive lyrics, similar to those on 'Home Alone' which have so far put me off buying another fine Williams score, the manufacturers of CD players thoughtfully included a 'track skip' button for just such instances, and the rest of the CD is absolutely excellent; the dips into slushiness can be forgiven thanks to the absolute magnitude of the excellence of the scores here. Honestly, even if you have never purchased a piece of film music before in your life, this would be an excellent start, and fans of Williams should be ashamed if they do not already have this fantastic score. Don't worry that the film was awful; just buy it. Now."
3,Not one of John Williams greatest scores,"Hook the movie is simply average, Hook the score is slightly above average. John Williams, who is among my favorite composers starts out promising on this Steven Speilberg film. His main theme is fun and perfect for the movie. However, as the cd goes on the music begins to get lost and themes start to fall apart. Perhaps this is due to the length, but by about midway through I was starting to get bored with this cd, and I'm a huge fan of long score cd's believe. Sometimes however they need to be shortened. Any sense of awe is lost, and by the conclusion, there is simply no childlike innocence and wonder like there was in ET. This is not a bad score, it's simply not one of John Williams best scores. I wanted to give it 3.5 but you can't so too bad. If you want a score that really fits with Peter Pan, go with james newton Howards recent score. Otherwise, there are many better John Williams scores out there, look one of those up."
5,Magic Flows Through This Music!,"I must start by saying that Hook really was a good movie. It not only lives up to J.M Barrie's vision, but added even more! Thanks to Mr. Speilberg.The music is nothing short of magic. John Williams packed this album with themes. A tinkerbell theme, a neverland theme, a hook theme, and a lost boys theme! He even does his orchestra ""swirly thing"" ""see tracks 5 and 6. :)This excellent album is a must have for any John Williams fan, or just a fan of good music."
4,too short,"A little short and the picture quality leaves something to be desired. To be fair however, it is an old movie short. I remember seeing it in theatres back when. It`s less than half an hour long and I felt a few other Nat King Cole shorts could have been included for the price. But for serious collectors it is a must."
4,Works fine,The blades work as expected with no problems or hang ups. It's nice to get something that you can trust.
3,Disappointing,"This is an okay book, but Lorna Tedder spends too much time writing about things that drift away from the subject, character histories and the like. Because of this the book moves slowly. I enjoy fast paced books so this did nothing for me. A decent read, however, if you enjoy this type of book."
4,A More Perfect Union,I have most of J.A. Jance's books. I read and re-read them. I like to follow the greater tale as well as each individual story. Finding a body in a movie set and the learning a bit about the movie industry as well as following the tale of the mystery was a very good book.
2,Tony 'not in' Touch,"The Reggaephony Album sounds old and doesn't even include today's great reggaeton artists. The cd isn't all bad but it will mislead people to think this is what qualify's as today's reggaeton. Let me say that I'm a big fan of Tony Touch but I paid full price for this New York style of reggeaton...which sucks. Reggeaton is from Puerto Rico and Tony Touch should go there for artists. Dude, you didn't get capicu you got stuck with the double zero!"
3,Too stiff for washing a car. Would survive WW III.,"It is true that this hose resists kinking like none other that I've used. But for ordinary home use, such as washing your car, this hose is so heavy and stiff, even when warm, that it is unmanageable. It is guaranteed for life, but I can't return it since it's not technically broken, so I'm giving it to a relative who needs a hose, any hose. I would only recommend this hose for heavy-duty commercial applications where flexibility is secondary to durability and non-kinking."
4,Wonderfully frustrating!,This was a powerful book that kept me intrigued and nervous as to what trials the travelers would next find. Such a magical atomosphere to this story. I too loved the French land owners and wished they could have been a larger part of the story. The end is frustrating but it is a chronicle of life in general. Not everything in life ends gracefully.
2,disappointing,"After reading the reviews for this book, I was expecting a Renaissance experience. No such luck. The character development was poor. The dialogue was every bit as bad, if not worse. And the plot? What plot? The book had much potential, but the author treated it much too casually, often violating the solemnity of the material with his tortuous lightness. The ""French plantation"" episode was poorly conceived and very unconvincing. The concept of this novel is one that could make it a classic, but due to the aforementioned, I am forced to give it a low rating."
1,Don't Buy This!,Microsoft no longer offers the code that is required in addition to this DVD. Your only option is a Windows 7 upgrade.
5,GT REVIEW,"GREAT FIT....QUALITY PRODUCT,THIS IS A GOOD APPERAENCE MOD.I WOULD RECCOMEND A ITEM LIKE THIS TO MY FRIENDS.GT STYLING ROCKS.Headlight Cover adds aerodynamic style and enhances the all-round appearance of the vehicle."
4,Another side of illegal human traffickinking,"When most people think about illegal immigration, they think of South American people crossing borders in order to assume low level jobs such as: migrant workers picking fruits and vegetables, house cleaning positions, kitchen work in the restaurants. But what many people seem to ignore or simple are not aware of is the fact that women and children are the most vulnerable beings in this process. The get traded as sex slaves all over the world. Without documents, language skills and awareness of how to contact authorities for help, their destinies are bleak. This film tackles some of those topics, but it leaves more questions unanswered. Film is an eye opener, but I must say one does not hear much about this talked about in public. In some respect, this topic is still very much a taboo."
4,The critics are dead wrong,"'Trade' is a deeply disturbing film that is very well done. The actors are all very believable in what are really difficult roles. Not easy to watch, but really gives you a feel for the creeps that inhabit this sick trade in human beings. Kate del Castillo plays one evil b---- to perfection."
3,Perfect if you're seeking a nice tame read,"I read this book directly following a novel with so many plot twists and character turmoil it left me emotionally exhausted. Compared to that, this book was pretty tame.It wasn't a bad read it just lacked a certain spark. In fact, it seemed a tad too ""prim"" since both characters believed they held secrets that weren't really as sordid as they made them out to be.I feel the writer took the safe route on this one. If you like dark family secrets and flawed characters I'm afraid this book is not for you. If you want a sweet, tame love story then that is what you will get."
2,JUST PLAIN DULL:(,"If you are looking for sensuality in a romance you won't find much in this book. The little you will find come very close to the end of the book. The book reads very slowly. There is nothing dramatic going on. No passion. Just waiting until the heroine trusts her patiently waiting husband enough to consumate their marriage. If 60% of the book was taken out, you wouldn't miss anything at all. The hero and heroine don't have chemistry at all. They remind me of an old couple who lives together/makes small talk/ and has comfortable silences. Like The Wilsons from Dennis the Menace. Admittedly, the 2 love scenes weren't bad, but you have to read 90% of the book before you get to them."
2,booooring...,"I had read the reviews that stated that this book was a little slow, but I hadn't expected for it to barely move at all. Forget the actual sensuality...this book has a teeny tiny story that is somehow (and at times painfully) spread out into a normal length book. I kept waiting for the scandals of his father and her father to come out, but when they did come to light it was just brushed over (and after so much build up too). I think this will be the first in a series. This is my first book by this author and was passed on to me by a friend. If she gives me the next in the series I will read it, but I am glad I didn't pay for this one and wouldn't pay for the sequel either."
2,Child's voice totally inappropriate. Be forewarned,"When I purchase music of this nature I expect it to be beautiful, soothing and instrumental. Certainly with no one saying anything. I have purchased many CDs over the years and this is the first one that I was not pleased with. I understand that music is a matter of personal taste, and of course, I like some CDs more than others. When I played this CD for the first time, and in the beginning and end of the first track heard a child's voice interrupt the music and say ""I love you mommy, I love you daddy"" I couldn't believe my ears. I know the track is called,""Innocent Child"", but I still see no reason for music that many of us use for contemplation, meditation, or just gently flowing background music, to have a child or any other voice saying anything. I love children and in many other types of music they add to the music content. Not true it this case. Had I known this beforehand I would have never ordered this CD."
5,Red Clogs,"These Clarks clogs are the same high quality - and good fit, that one expects from Clarks."
3,great but not the best secret seven.,This is a good read but very scaery compared to the other secret seven books.would recommend those first for 9-12 age group.
5,don't get sunburned,excellent device for preventing sunburn and other skin disorders. a must if you burn easily or go to an unfamiliar site.
5,Excellent!!!,"This CD came in within a week of being ordered and it's in fantastic shape! The sound is crisp and clear, there was no damage to the CD! I was really impressed with how well it works!The songs themselves are wonderful! My favorites being ""Two Dozen Roses,"" ""Next to You, Next to Me,"" and ""Moon Over Georgia"" It's wonderful to hear some fun old country classics! I'd recommend this for anyone and everyone who likes, loves, or is just getting interested in Country Music!"
1,A sad excuse for humor,"This is a movie about a brave person living a productive, responsible life. However, his customers, employees, and family treat him like dirt because of the nature of his work. I guess that is supposed to be funny, but I found it quite sad. I think you will only find this humorous if you enjoy laughing at others' debasement."
2,Not very good,"When it was new, the annoying features were:-The available ring tones are all piercing and obtrusive.-The answering machine is counter-intuitive, its automated voice is unnatural and unpleasant, and it's had to navigate from message to message.-The date/time is lost every time the electricity goes off, even if it is only for a fraction of a second.Now that I've had the phones for over a year, the jack for the headphones is not working in either of the two receptors.I wouldn't buy this model again."
1,hasnt worked right since 1 month...,"i have always heard how wonderful toshiba electronics are, but this vcr has been screwball since a few weeks after purchase. sometimes won't play, sometimes won't rewind, occasionally eats tapes."
2,Voracious VCR,"Well, I read the reviews, and ought to have listened a bit harder. No question that the VCR is a bargain and perhaps I and the other negative reviewers got duff machines, but this one ate a tape within the first hour of play. I am returning it today, sadly, and will check out other Amazon electronics. I have to say that I have never had a bad experience with Amazon with anything except one bad CD and don't blame them in the slightest. I think that perhaps one gets what one pays for?"
2,May be used as a parachute in case of emergency,"I completely agree with the other reviewer. This bag is massive. It looks nice in the picture - but no - it's huge. I decided to test it out and put my laptop in it - the bag was so big my 15"" laptop moved from side to side and up and down. I went to Target - found a lovely, smaller, tote bag for $25 - padded just as well as this one and holds my laptop better in place. Remember too if you're someone that does carry a lot of things this bag only has three compartments so you cannot use that extra space to a great benefit."
1,Half of the product missing!,I am not happy. I wish I had read some of the previous reviews. The order was not complete. The outer foam filter was missing. And then Amazon suggests I send back the part I did get and simply order it again. You think I'm ever going to order from this seller after leaving out half of my purchase?!?!? WRONG.Do not buy this product from this seller; buy it from someone else. You'll waste time and patience trying to get it from here.
3,Roget's Thesaurus of Phrases,I think it needed a little better cross-referencing capabilities. I had a specific word I was working with and needed phrases to go with that word. You can't look up most single words. There is no listing.
5,Real Taiwanese Dim Sum,"My wife studied Mandarin in Taiwan before the PRC opened up. She's had this book since it was published. The recipes are time consuming - that's how Taiwanese and Chinese cooking is . The chef does all the work , and the food is designed to be shared and eaten with chopsticks. That said , this book is a good choice given the pictures of the finished dishes and prep. The recipes are accurate . The Pork Chop Noodle , for example , is identical to what I've had in China -a little better in fact. In addition , its a cookbook designed for real cooking. That laminated cover doesn't get ruined when the oil spatters. Sure it's work , but if you live somewhere where the Dim Sum is dismal this is one way out."
5,Chinese Snacks (Wei quan shi pu),Speedy delivery. The book is excellent. It makes a great Christmas gift!
4,Could Have Been a 5 Star but ...........................,"Could have been a 5 star EXCEPT ................ there is that Shift key thing. On other keyboards the shift key is double wide, for some reason on these keyboards the shift key has been cut down and an * key added in. It's irritating to say the least. The ""everyday"" keyboard takes a little getting used to in that the space bar is split, other than that it is a great setup. I love being able to change layouts on the fly, and the USB ports are amazingly wonderful. BTW the layout for WoW is very well done. Thanks for a great product!"
3,Just ok,"Kinda dissapointed, this album is fair at best and could have been better. Im not sure who wrote the lyrics for these songs but they could have done much better, and thats whats lacking here. The music is rocking I especially love the sound of the drums and bass, very deep and driving. some good guitar here also. They could have put some better lyrics to these songs and knocked it outta the park, saying that twice, thats my biggest gripe."
5,Doesn't shrink and protects the pillow well,"A great addition to the boppy collection, the slipcover is cute and functions really well. I don't believe it's waterproof, but definitely has kept my Boppy from absorbing milk and spit up. Washed and dried many times and it still fits the pillow just fine. Zipper is well covered so it never gets caught on clothes or otherwise. Really easy to slide the pillow inside of the cover as well - no fighting to fit it in."
5,fantastic,"I got this as a wedding gift yesterday, and i'm already in love! the corn fully pops, fast! and nothing burns. there was not one unpopped kernel! i am excited to try some of the recipes that came with it! :)"
5,Will be buying more Bo Tully!,"Got this book on Friday afternoon, finished it on Sat morning. Have read McManus before, but hadn't tried the mysteries, just enough humor to keep me giggling, but the twists and turns kept me thinking, will definitely have to read the whole series."
1,So bad it's funny.,"My daughter bought this for me as a joke gift for Christmas... she only paid $0.99 for it which was about $0.99 too much. It only makes me wonder how low Leslie Nielsen sank in his career that he was compelled to make this movie. I gave it a one star rating only because I couldn't figure out how to give it zero stars.Having said that, if you ignore my warnings and buy the movie, try watching it with the sound turned down and make up your own dialogue... it's pretty funny that way."
2,"It's Okay, but why when you can have David B.'s Book?","I Bought this book at the store because it was cheaper and compact...Dumb Idea. I was mad at how it's name was Rollercoasters instead of ""Rollercoasters:Woodie's and More"". The only pictures I really liked were the big Cobra Roll of Alpengheist on the Back and the T2 picture on Page 8. I would tell everyone to buy David B's book instead because 1) It's a couple years ahead, 2) Beautiful Pictures of both Wood and Steel coasters, 3)It's Clear and Easy to understand, and 4) IT'S ACCURATE. Some of the things in this book are off by miles, from Opening Dates, to Height and Lenghth, Even Type!(i.e. Wood Out and Back Oval). The only reason I would tell you to buy this book is because it can fit through your door(David B's Book is kinda big!) and it's 6 to 8 Bucks cheaper! Or you may be a Woodie Lover. Otherwise buy David B's Book!"
2,An OK Book,"I thought the practice tests in this book were a lot easier than the actual test itself. I felt like it did not prepare me as well as it should have. I know they have to make the real test harder, but they really should update this book ASAP and put some harder math ?'s in this book as well."
3,"yup, works great at its own pace","I agree with other reviewers, it works pretty well, its pretty cheap, but when you are checking a lot of things, its pretty frustrating to wait so long for the measurement to settle."
2,Poor wheel bearings,"Bought 2 of these, loaded a single desk with both units and during the move the wheels began to wobble. Examining the wheel it looks like there is no wheel bearing and the wheel inner walls simply distorted leaving a fairly nonfunctional furniture dolly...."
5,Sango the Demon Slayer,"I'm a huge InuYasha fan and I have almost every action figure available. Sango is the coolest one yet! She comes with her hirakustu {sp?} Kirara, her katana and a little stand. If you love InuYasha like I do, I would highly recommend buying this figure!"
3,Cut up pages,"The book is in ok condition, however I'm curious as to why someone would take a pair of scissors to the Index page."
4,Great book!,"This book had all the information I needed for my class and in some topics surpassed my expectations. It was not specific for my professional area, but gave me all the hints I needed. Good choice!"
5,KYB Shocks,"I purchased these front shocks for my 2002 Jaguar XJ8 at a fair price and received very fast shipping.They were easy to install and work very well. My originals were starting to leak oil and these are brand new, although it has only been a couple of weeks,I feel they have improved the ride."
2,Singularly Unimpressed,"They are heavy, which is nice, but dreadfully overbalanced and way oversized. Worse, they look like they were stamped out instead of having any real design being less three dimensional than the pictures imply. They have all the style of prison uniforms.However, they are wonderfully shiny and the metal is very near perfect."
3,MURDER MOST ENGLISH,"GUESS WE HAVE BEEN SPOILED BY SUCH MYSTERIES AS CAMPION, INSPECTOR LYNLEY, ETC. WE FOUND THIS TO BE A BIT SLOW AND DATED."
1,Murder most English,"There are no words to describe this DVD!! The acting is awful, the plot non existent just talk all through it. We don't know what happened in the ending of the first part and the second part was entirely about another plot. This DVD should never have been released or at least had a warning label on it for ""boring"". Can't believe it was so expensive for such trash. Even had some intimate groping. Believe those other reviews that called it ""god awful"""
1,terrible--be warned!,"I could only watch 10 minutes of this boxed set--too wretched to waste further time on.I think potential buyers should be warned: this set is not remotely up to the ""standard"" British mysteries we Americans are used to from the many classic series on PBS and is nothing like its title (""Murder Most English""). I feel deeply cheated, having wasted my money on this expensive set. Disgusted and angry."
4,"NOT THE BEST IN THE SERIES!, BUT VERY GOOD!","This is one of my least favorites in the series. I rate this right behind ""The Dead Pool"" The third installment gives ""Harry"" yet another partner,this time it's Tyne Daly(Cagney & Lacy)(Judging Amy)and the movie has that 70's TV movie feel once again. I am a fan of the entire series and I do like this film, but it just seemed like it didn't have much new to add to the series. This is one of the shortest films in the ""Dirty Harry"" franchise, but it didn't seem like it. It is by all means a very good and worthy installment and should not be missed. The DVD transfer is very good and the disc has some extras."
2,The Weakest Harry of Them All,"Fans of Clint Eastwood's original ""Dirty Harry"" will find little to cheer about in this uninspired sequel. Despite good performances by Eastwood and co-star Tyne Daly, ""The Enforcer"" (1976) suffers from a poorly developed script and James Fargo's lackluster direction. The action highlights are rather sparse, with surprisingly few Clint one-liners to enliven the proceedings. Jerry Fielding's jazz-oriented score is a weak substitute for the pulsating rhythms of composer Lalo Schifrin. A definite low point in the Inspector Callahan series."
2,Slide copier,"Does copy the slide, but the image appears at the end of a tube and you have to play around with it before it is usable. The resulting image is not as good as it could be."
4,Works great with Windows ME. Needs Linux support.,"I plugged my PCMCIA smart media adaptor into my Windows ME box, and it worked perfectly with my 64MB smartmedia memory. My only complaint is that they don't have linux support for it."
4,#330 trap,"It is a well built machine. It does require the setting tool, at least for this old guy. But I will need to weld an extension on the handles to have full control when compressing the springs."
3,Same old stuff.,"I felt that this Cd could have been better. I loved Baila Esta Cumbia, Dreaming of you, and Don't cry mama because they were new or remixed. I went out and bought this Cd and I was so excited cause I thought it was gonna have all new songs but instead I get a bunch of the old ones. I love my Kumbia Kings though."
4,mam bottles,"I like the bottles a lot. Just got to make sure the bottom and top are screwed on right. I don't like the idea that you can only buy them online. I like to be able to pick things up at the store when I'm out and not have to wait for the mail, or pay outrageous charges for overnite shipping. You should sell them in stores like Walmart and Target. A lot of people would appreciate it!"
5,This is an excellent product Sony has here.,I like everything about it. It has great features and good accessories with it. The only problem I have with it is the cover just because it seems it'll easily break off. I recommend this product for anyone!
1,It sucked horribly,my thing broke in two weeks when I bought. I bought a koss and it worked so much better. If you read this deffinetly DON'T buy this product!!!!!!!
1,can't hear a thang,i just bought this from a store and it was 130.00 dollas and i can't hear a word coming out. i took it back but they said they couldn't fix. :(:(:(:(
4,good with few flaws-D-E446CK,"I like mine a lot, it never skips on the bus or in my pocket even with esp off (i almost never use esp) it has great features, but i dont have time to do a full review and list them all. It reads scratched cd's and cd-r's well. The lid is a bit loose and it skips for no reason at all every once in a while. These are my only complaints. I've had it for about 4 months, and the skipping problems has gone away a little bit, and the lid hasn't gotten any looser."
4,Adopting a chinese daughter prior to the CCCA,"Baby In A Box is the story of one missionary family's struggle to bring together an abandoned Chinese daughter and an American family. The union takes place in China prior to the establishment of the CCCA and centralization of China's international adoption procedures. While a story of adoption, revelations regarding Chinese culture are telling. Together, this family's experience will be interesting to those who have adopted and/or are planning to adopt, as well as those with interest in Christian missionaries' struggle in China."
2,doesn't work,I bought this from a local dealer. I tried drying two different things twice and both times I used five trays. The bottom one was crispy and the rest were still very wet. My local dealer is working with me to resolve this. I will not try another one like this again.
1,Terrible,"This was the second item I bought and like the first, it burst into flames on switching it on, and when I sent it back as I had sent the first one, i did not receive a refund when it was received back. I am very unhappy with this product and the company and I ended up buying a different make dehydrator.. Where is my refund???"
3,Heating Element Died after two uses,"I used this dehydrator twice before the heating element stopped working, causing 20 lbs of tomatoes to mold on my counter. The two times I used it, it didn't seem to dry very quickly - 1/4"" thick peach slices (with 5 trays full) took three full days to dry. I expected better to be honest.I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 because I'm hoping I just got a dud and they're normally better. I called customer service and someone picked up on the fourth ring. Major points for that. I told him what happened and that it was only a few months old and he said he'd send me a UPS label to return it for a replacement right away. That won't save my moldy tomatoes but it's pretty great customer service.If you get a dud of any appliance the key is calling QUICKLY before they can blame it on age. Anyway, I'll try to update this post once I get my new dehydrator replacement."
3,Takes too long to dry,"Filled all 6 trays (included with the dehydrator) with bananas. Time to dry (according to the manual) was 6-10 hours. After 19 hours, and up 3 X at nite to rotate trays, bananas still not dry. Finally threw them all out.Next day filled 6 trays with apples, cored (so had holes in middle), and not as close. Time (according to manual was 4-l0, took 15 hours to dry. Temp (according to manual) was at 125. Not hardly worth the time for so little return.Would not purchase again. Patricia"
4,Brill book especially if you are planning to visit Bolivia,"Didn`t know what to expect and having just visited Bolivia really enjoyed this book.Real page turner, sex, drugs, violence and thouroughly fascinating.Two minor criticisms though. Firstly Thomas does play the victim a bit - let`s get real, he was a drug trafficker and no matter how unfair his treatment, if you break the law in another country you should be prepared to accept the consequences, not that Thomas hides the fact he is guilty, but he does unwittingly gain sympathy.Secondly, it is a bit hippy, traveller, everybody loves everybody, which I guess is no criticism but if you are a cynic like me...I would find it hard not to take the piss more out of the people that came on his tours having met several crusty niaive travellers myself, but this would not stop me recomending this as a must for anyone visiting Bolivia!"
2,boring,"While you would think a book about such a bizarre South American prison couldn't help but be compelling Young and McFadden manage to turn out an absolute yawn. On top of that, my impression is that McFadden is a b.s. artist. Too bad."
5,Damn The Tumor...Full Speed Ahead,"It was after my first biopsy on the first night home from the hospital that I started reading this book. In the whirlwind of suddenly being diognosed with a brain tumor, having surgery and being sent home on medication without a clue what to think or how to handle it, reading Dick's book was very inspiring. With a combination of interesting stories and honest,unique and very humorous insights into the challenges he has met,this book will help anyone view their lives in a new and better light.Thank you, Mr. Schmelzkopf ... Into The Tiger's Mouth!!!"
5,Humor with Brain Damage,"The author is able to share his experience with the heartbreak of a brain injury entwined with a sense of humor as he recovers. His ability to write about both was obviously a large portion of the healing process for him. This gives the reader an insight to his never ending lesson in perserverance. Recommended reading, especially to appreciate the positive outcome Dick Schmelzkopf is experiencing to day."
3,"Too fragrant, too expensive","Despite trying this on in the store and liking it, when I put some on today, I noticed just how strong the scent is. I have trouble with some scents giving me headaches, and thought since I tried it on the store, I'd be safe. Not so. Within minutes of putting this on, I had a headache. I love the fragrance, but there's something in there that triggers a headache for me.Also, this is insanely expensive lotion! Though I received this as a gift, it was $24 and now feel bad since I won't be able to use it.The ceramic jar it comes in is really nice though. Very classy-looking."
1,Honest Doubt,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Having read all of the previous mysteries written by Amanda Cross, I was looking forward to enjoying her literate and witty style, a thought-provoking plot and interesting character development. This book fails miserably in all three areas. The style is turgid, the plot is almost non-existent with a cop-out ending and the characters are one-dimensional (although I'm sure that Woody would say that she had more dimensions that that--I really did get weary of all the references to her size). I can only hope that the author will go back to creating a well-crafted mystery next time around. But I will first check with other reviewers before buying another book by Cross so that I'm not burned again by purchasing another such boring and poorly written myster."
2,"Hello Woody, Goodbye Kate","As an avid mystery reader, I grabbed Amanda Cross' ""Honest Doubt"" hoping to find something literate and engaging. The Cover read 'A Kate Fansler Novel,"" whom I hoped to add to my list of must-read dectectives. What I found was Estelle ""Woody"" Woodhaven a fat female detective hired to solve the murder of a pretentious Professor of English Literature. Woody enlists Kate's help to solve the murder as she feels totally out of her league in Academia. While Woody's constant references to her size is annoying;it is her worship of Kate's intellect that eventually made this novel a real bore. One wonders how Woody made it through Law School. The characters are annoying and poorly drawn and the plot convoluted. I Would like to see Woody's Character in another novel sans Kate and with less reference to her size."
1,What happened to Amanda Cross?,"As soon as I found that another book by Amanda Cross was coming , I put my name on the library's request list and persued the bookstores for it. But when I started reading, it was so disappointing to find such a poorly written book.The character Woody was drawn with a sledge hammer. As I read where she put her helmet or that she obsessed about her weight for the nth time, I was sadden that Cross's past skills in character development had disappeared. Where was her sophisticated and literate writing Style?What happened to Amanda Cross?"
2,Shattered on Arrival,"Very disappointed! The lamp would have been a nice one, but it arrived with the base shattered and ceramic pieces in the bottom of the wrapping.I felt so bad since it was a Christmas present for my daughter & she really liked the lamp when she saw it online. Now we have to go thru the ordeal of repacking it & getting someone to help us bring it to post office, as it is a very big & heavy box. I surely hope Amazon will pay the postage for us to return the lamp!"
2,"It was ok, but I was dissapointed as well...","I agree that this dvd was a pretty big disappointment. I went to this tour twice, once in Atlanta and once in Denver. It was an amazing show and so I expected the DVD that I pre-ordered to be able to capture this. I too was appalled with most everything to do with this DVD. Particularly the song selection, and the lack of special features. I think for the price each band should have gotten more songs, especially Decapitated, whom is no longer together because of the tragedy. I would like to comment though on the fact of why Arsis is not on the DVD. For those of you who may know, Arsis had broken down while on this tour and missed quite a few shows (including the show that the dvd was filmed at). That is why they are not on the dvd, but they should have taken their name off of the cover. Altogether, I felt completely ripped off buying this dvd. It's a good thing the live shows were so unbelievable."
4,Summer Slaughter Tour dvd,All the bands had three songs each. That is ok for the bands I don't care for. I really wanted to see more music from the bands I like.
2,didn't fit,"I bought this specifically to go with a Hunter fan that I bought (that was supposed to be compatible) and the unit was too big to fit in the fixture. It has since been sitting somewhere, unused, in the garage. Bummer."
3,A little unpredictable,"Found out when we installed this remote with the ceiling fan that something has made the fan start up without us even being in the room or touching the remote. We have had the fan and remote installed for about one month now and for the first two weeks, had issues with the fan coming on by itself, but have had no problems since then."
3,"Good idea, but fall short on quality.","There are numerous typos, probably one every chapter. The idea behind this book is great, however the author has a very difficult way of explaining the concepts leaving you reading and re-reading sentences over and over again. There needs to be more depth, and a professional review to correct grammer, typo's, and perhaps write more coherently.The book is good, I would own it, but it really needs major improvments."
4,Incredible story...,"""Aphrodite: Desperate Mission. The incredible story - and even more incredible aftermath - of the top secret mission to save London, and possibly New York, from German rockets. The near-suicide mission resulted in supreme sacrifice (it cost the life of Joe Kennedy, Jr.) -and consequences no one could have forseen.""The incredible story of one of the most incredible missions of World War II, to stop the German V-1 rockets that were rained death and destruction on England. These missions were most dangerous and many Pilots lost their lives, one Pilot being Joseph Kennedy, Jr. Illustrated with photographs. Tipped in is a copy of a note from Dale ""Andy"" Anderson, Colonel U.S.A.F. Retired, Anderson was one of the Pilots flying these missions, and in the note is a comment about the death of Joseph Kennedy, who some question as being most suspicious.With photos, 328 pages."
4,SALBOAT BATTERY BOX,This large battery box enabled me to put 6 Trojan T105 Golf Cart batteries in one enclosure. This eliminated longer runs of oo cable.
3,Enjoyable,"Now I did give it a three star because overall it is predictable and drags a bit here and there. It kept my interest enough for me to continue on to book four. Hope it gets better though.Some of my favorite characters were the Dread Lords of Zhev'na. not sure why, maybe because they were so interesting."
5,EXCELLENT MUST READ,"This was the first book I have read from this author and I plan to read them all now. This book grabbed me, and I could not wait to see what was going to happen next. I was a little disappointed in the way things ended with Judy, but the book over all was great. I read this book in one day because I could not put it down. Everyone needs to read this book."
4,Small Town Girl,"I especially loved reading this book about the twists and turns of passions between Kenny and Tess. It really makes you feel that you should always keep your eyes open for love because you never really know where it is going to come about. It was great reading this book, quick read yet very detailed in what happens!!!"
1,Picture of 3 Cowbells You Receive only 1,The photograph advertising this product is deceptive and misleading. It lead me to believe I would receive 3 bells but you actually only get 1 for over $50 which is very much a ripoff.
1,NOT US MADE PRODUCT AS ADVERTISED!!,"The product is advertised as a US MADE item, however the received item (same part #, sold and shipped by Amazon) is made in CHINA. The ONLY reason I purchased the Shur-Line paint roller cleaner is due to it being US MADE. Does it work, yes. Is it what was advertised, no. The rating is based on the obvious false advertising, not the product itself."
1,Sucks for Planning a Trip to Mayan Ruins: AVOID,"I love Lonely Planet books, but this version for Central America on a Shoestring SUCKS BALLS for planning a trip to Mayan Ruins.Here are some quotes:p15 on planning itineraries lists ruins as a ""Side Trip"" and says of Chichen Itza ""If you've done Mexico, though, skip it.""p45 lists the top seven ruins to visit, of two of those, Tonina and Chinkultic, less than a paragraph is written on each, LESS THAN A PARAGRAPH, seriously, only 25 words on Chinkultic, and most of those are ""of, for, the,"" ect...p45 on Chichen Itza, there is no discussion of where to stayp34 to p73, only 40 pages, summarizes all of Mexico horribly leaving out tons of important information, while nearby Guatemala of lesser size and less ruins gets p74 to 214, 140 pages!AVOID THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO VISIT RUINS, I bet Let's Go does a better job."
2,where're my dvds?,the DVDs never did reach their destination... which I ordered almost a month ago...
3,color comes off and very painful,I like the shoes but the black around the ankles comes off onto my hands and feet. No matter what i did it just kept coming off. Then the zipper began to rip up the back of my legs after just a few minutes of wearing them. I would not buy shoes from this company again but loved their other items. would of lowered the stars but wouldnt let me. Throwing out the shoes.
3,Cuddle Ewe Under Quilt not up to the hype,"I had heard so much about this product that I finally decided to try it. I have fibromyalgia and even the Sleep Number bed I have is not very comfortable, so I decided to try the Cuddle Ewe quilt. It's better than a plain mattress, but it flattens out within one night and needs daily ""fluffing"", and halfway through the night it ""bottoms-out"" again. I definitely don't think it's worth the price and the ""free pillow"" that is included is very flat and covered with a material that borders on plastic. It's not conducive to a good night's sleep. Over all, it's better than nothing, but not up to the hype the advertisers give it."
4,Good tights/poor sizing description,"Product is great, the only thing is I would have liked to have better sizing written before I bought it. It just said ys,ym,yl etc with no guideline on each size. I bought the YL and my son wears a 12, the tights fit barely and won't be able to be worn next year."
3,only lasts a year,this worked great until the battery for the main unit crapped out. I swapped out the batteries (no corrosion or anything) but I can't get the thing to work again. I guess I'll have to ask Santa for a new indoor/outdoor(but a different brand this time!)
3,No audio?,"Doesnt look like this thing has audio capability, which is not good for me because I dont have seperate speakers to hook up to my PC directly. It would have been nice to point that out on the description."
1,cheated again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS THE ARMCHAIR DETECTIVE VOL 1, BUT ONLY INSIDE THE BOOK, IN VERY SMALL LETTERS, IS THE INFORMATION. NOW I HAVE THE SAME BOOK TWICE. ITS A SHAME THE PUBLISHER HAS TO USE THIS METHOD, AND THAT MR. WEBER ALLOWS IT."
1,"A Bilingual Guide to Hate - A Dangerous, Often Banned Book","Did you know that this book, created by the Czar's secret police, helped lead to the Russian pogroms that killed thousands of innocent Jews? It also ""inspired"" Hitler - and helped convince millions of ""decent"" Germans to participate in the mass murder of 6 million Jews. Did you know that this book is banned in many European countries?While you find this book valuable as a historical artifact of racial hatred, 19th century conspiracy thinking, or Holocaust studies, I'd suggest simply reading a short excerpt to limit the intake of mental poison.But I must confess my bias. My grandfather was murdered in a concentration camp, and my father raised in a Brooklyn orphanage. A proud veteran of the SS might have a different point of view."
5,perfect,"The lock was just as it was described. So far so good, the bike is still here. We have had 2 bikes stolen using other locks. This lock seems to deter the thieves."
2,Number 10 is more a 2,"Although filled with marvelous actors who do a very fine job of creating their roles, I found these productions lacking in writing skills and at times without a clear understanding of what was going on. It was a pleasure to see many actors in their beginning stages and I have no fault that these productions were dated. It was all about the story line or lack thereof. It almost seemed that the writer had a ""bone to pick"" with some of the former Prime Ministers and this was his opportunity to make his point.The entire series was a huge disappointment and after sharing it with some friends, whose opinions were the same as mine after viewing, I consider it to be the worse dvd purchase of the year."
2,Not Center,My daughter loves Dora. I bought this comforter for her third birthday and was alittle disapointed in the quality. It is very thin and Dora is not in the center. There's 1/2 of Dora on each side. I don't know if they are all like that or just how mine was cut.
4,'Get Yourself A College Girl' (MGM Records) Movie Soundtrack,"I've heard this hard-to-find lp (of the 1964 movie) and have occasionally seen it in old vinyl shops. Total of twelve tracks - by the likes of some great '60's bands such as the Animals with ""Around And Around"" and ""Blue Feeling"", the Dave Clark Five contributing ""Whenever You're Around"" and the catchy ""Thinking Of You, Baby"" as well as the Standells with ""Bony Moronie"" and one I just plain don't remember - ""The Swim"". Then there are a couple of acts I'm totally unfamiliar with - Stan Getz and the Jimmy Smith Trio. A TRUE collector's item."
2,"2 stars, but only for the concept","This book is filled with misinformation. My husband & I found several incorrect answers when going through it the first time. The concept is GREAT...a book dedicated to the pop culture of the 1980s! SUPER COOL! However, that's where the excitement ends. You'll have a better times looking online at different short trivia games. Incredibly disappointing!"
2,broke away too easily,I purchased this for my cat to use with a pet locator device. I purchased Loc8tor Pet device. I successfully attached the transmitter but the first item my cat went out the collar didn't make it back with him. Now I need to find a collar that doesn't break away so easily.
4,nice toy,"Gift for my Grandson, he likes it and it has held up just fine - even with abuse by his 18 month old brother."
5,strathwood market umbrella,This is a great buy. I received my umbrella in 2 days. The umbrella is very sturdy and the cloth is heavy. This appears to be a very expensive umbrella at a great price. i am actually ordering another one to add to my deck.
2,Distracting Narrative,"Twenty years after my only trig course, I thought this book would provide a good review. The word ""easy"" in the title was a big seller. Unfortunately the book uses a rather silly story to tie together the various chapters, and the number of fully-worked-out problems is minimal."
4,Extremely weird and quite sexy movie,"The subject pretty much says it all... this is an extremely weird and quite sexy movie.If you are looking for a typical vampire movie, this one is not it, but if you are in the mood to see some funky, weird and crazy immagination at work then this could be it."
4,Extended Usage,Most users lamented the fact that the ribbon only lasted long enough for 30 prints. I experimented by rewinding the ribbon and got reasonable prints. Worth a try.
5,The Real World,"Being a political operative seems like a glamorous profession. While there certainly are perks -- there are an equal number of disadvantages to this career choice. Rollins' depiction of what it's like to be a campaign manager is the truest I've read. It's not always a glamorous lifestyle. Even the best campaigns are full of fast food, headaches and heartaches (now there's a title)! Rollins does a great job of telling ""the real"" story of being a campaign manager...the good, the bad, and the ugly..."
1,Not so good,"The bees love it, but the orioles not so much. This attracted a bunch of bees to my feeders. The bees fit in the holes perfectly, unlike the hummingbird feeders. I recommend sticking to grape jelly for the orioles, at least in Iowa."
4,looks good,I am hesitant to write a review on this as I have not had the need to use it yet and I surely don't want to jinx myself. It looks well made and fits nicely in my under seat pouch.
2,Half of these patches failed on me. Do not buy.,"I bought two of these kits, one on amazon and another at my bike shop, and I have had way too many flats caused by the patches failing and I think I'll replace the tube and just use the glued patches instead. This is on my 29er mountain bike, 2.1"" knobby Maxxis Crossmark tire.Although, for the price, you can look at it this way: you get 3 tire levers and an unreliable patch kit thrown in, so 2 stars."
3,"Fast shipping, Works as expected, Slightly different than picture","Product arrived in time and the tire levers work well.BUT, the two levers are NOT AS PICTURED. The levers with the kit all have the hook that connects to the wheel spokes. The picture describes a lever with a hook for spokes, and another lever with a clip for spokes. This is not what arrives in the package. Still, the product works as needed.Shipping was fast. Still happy overall. I would recommend the levers. They work and they could not be cheaper."
2,"Two tips bent after about 20 uses, four out of four patches did leak air over a 2 month period.",The levers seemed strong but the tip does bend after several uses. Also the patch seems to hold air after several weeks and gradually leak over a 2 month period despite proper patching technique. I find rubber cement patch kit work better than this tape patch even though it's more convenient on trails.
2,Just more takes by Rodman,"This book was alright (it got me through jury duty). If you like Rodman and you want to hear his opinions about fellow players and what the NBA is really like, then check this out. If given the chance, I would not purchase this book again just because you can hear Rodman's opinions for free on the nightly news."
4,Way to go Dennis!!,"For all his outrageous behavior on the court, nobody really felt the need to see what goes on in the mind of Dennis Rodman. This book attempts to do just that and I can say that Dennis is just as human as we all are"
2,Good Price - Uncomfortable and Poor Sound Quality,"The price is good. Apparently the microphone works fine, but on my end it sounds like i'm listening to a muffled tin-can. It's also quite uncomfortable. Fortunately, it's cheap enough to throw it out and find one with better sound and variable sized earpieces."
4,Great product!,"I have used this for about a year now, off and on, when needed. Its worked really well, my only problem is I need to buy the capsules because the oregano is VERY hot! But it is very effective!"
4,"not his best, but still great","This book is probably better for those who already are immersed in Discworld rather than an newcomer, as there are many jokes that wouldn't make sense to a newbie. It is a wonderful complement to ""Thud!"""
5,10 years later DK's Animal is still breathtaking and amazing.,"DK's Animal has set the standard for future reference books which include Earth, Universe, Science, History, Prehistoric Life, Ocean, Art and Natural History, books that were published by DK and books that I own.10 years after it's first publication in 2001, this updated book gives a breathtaking and stunning visual look of ouranimal wildlife from huge mammals to tiny insects. With this updated version of DK's Animal one can look at the spectacular beauty of our wildlife with over 50 new species catalogued and represented. The stunning photography make this book a must have for zoologists, animal enthusiasts and for anyone who is fascinated by our animal kingdom. This is the visual story of our animal wildlife through stunning photography and illustrated graphics that bring the breadth and bizarreness that is our wildlife."
4,"Love the Thomas trains, this is my least favorite","In general I think the Thomas wooden trains are fantastic. My 3 year old loves them and plays for hours. He makes up stories or acts out the stories from the videos, he carries different trains around with him on outings. They're his toys & his security blanket. However, not crazy about Terrence, the rubber tires came off about 1/2 hour after opening the box. This is the only one that I have had trouble with. Fortunately Terrece can now be played with ont he train tracks instead of off-track but my son still asks for his ""wheels"" (which I threw away)."
5,So helpful!,"I have been figure skating for over ten years, but this book was incredibly helpful! It has on and off-ice exercises to help learn and/or improve jumps, spins, skating vocabulary, and overall skating strength. The book is full of helpful tips and pictures. I have already recommended this book to all of my skating friends, and I absolutely recommend it to everyone else!"
5,Excellent,The tutorials will have you using the software in no time and the user interface makes the editing process fun rather than tedious. By the way it can import and export MPEG-2. It can't import RealMedia but it can export it. I like this software and recommend it.
3,Navagation proves difficult.,"Ok I have this program & have installed it & uninstalled it a number of times on my computer. I love all the cool effects it has, but I have had problems actaully trying ot use them!! I LOVE WMM2 & have found that VERY easy to navigate, but it doesnt have nearly the amt of cool effects as this does! If someone could help me out, I'd appreciate it!I would love to continue making more BTVS videos, & hopefully get my $$'s worth out of this software!"
3,Cute for a two-year-old,"My two-year-old loves Dora, so this sheet set was perfect for her. We only have the sheets, not the comforter or accessories. The sheets are typical children's sheets (low thread count, a bit rough), but the design is exactly what any Dora fan would want."
5,Truman and the Human Fanily,"Here is a most readable and interesting first-hand account and association with one of America's great presidents. Frank Kelly's book reveals the integrity and strong character of this man. As one of his speech writers, he had personal contacts with Truman and tells much about his life which could only be told from the intimate contacts he had with the President. He participated in the day to day presidential campaign which led to one of the most surprising and stunning victories any president ever had.Kelly served as an assistant to the majority leader of the senate in 1949 and the early fifties and brings an accurate and authentic character study of Truman from inside the political realm. If you want to know close-up about this remarkable and able president from someone who was there, this book tells it all."
4,A Must Own Album! Up and Comers!,"These guys are amazing! Their catchy lyrics keep you singing along and also make you laugh in songs like ""Boys Lie."" The music itself will leave you humming or tapping your foot. This album is a good mix of solid rock songs like ""Hey You"" and ""On Saturday"" and slower ballads like, ""Love is What you Need"" and ""Inside You"". Can't tell you who they sound like because the Clarks have a sound all of their own! These guys are smart and very talented. The Clarks are a Pittsburgh favorite but have been kept relatively hidden from national fame. Tell your friends to take a listen and be the one who gets credit for discovering the next best thing."
3,So Far So Good,"This is my second Garelick stainless steel seat swivel in two years. I used it maybe three times a month. The nylon bearing gave up on the first one, and it had to be trashed since the bearing cannot be replaced. Such a waste of good stainless steel! Garelick should make it so it can be serviced. We will see how long the second one last."
5,OSTER POWER PRO CORDLESS CLIPPERS,Just about the best clippers for horse people. Takes a charge quickly and holds it long enough to do the job. Uses different brands of blades so finding blades is never a problem. Powerful motor. Blades are easy to change.
1,"Spend a little more, get something good...","I thought I'd take a chance on this filter for the price. I wanted to buy something a little nicer, and should have. The filter doesn't even come close to sealing with the included gasket. I spent my time to set up correctly, tried every remedy listed for this problem, and decided to return the filter today. Luckily Amazon has a great return policy, so I will be able to buy what I should have in the first place; something nicer. The filter leaked terribly no matter how the cover was installed. I might as well have just dumped all the water on my carpet. Cleaned up a big mess, then tried filling the canister with water in my sink. Put the cover on and it leaks from the gasket no matter what. Too bad."
4,Works great now for 3 months,"I purchased two of these filters for two fish tanks for a classroom project in which we are raising trout from eggs. The students and I found the video instructions to be clear and easy to follow. Both filters were up and running in no time. Some people have mentioned problems with the priming pumps, but although it took a little while to purge the air from the filter, we found that they worked as advertised.Filters have been working great thus far."
3,Just ok,"When we first got this train for my son's birthday we only had it and a Thomas train. By themselves they were just ok. You really do need some tracks or one of the sets to go with them. Even then my son is not really that into trains. But really that's more him than the toy. They are wooden so the paint does wear off, but there is something nice about having a wooden train and my son doesn't notice the missing paint at all."
5,THIS IS MY FAV BAND,i'm not really a kid....lol buti love this band and i have all their cds...yes konstantine is the best song ever and prob the longest...lol leaving threw the window is ok north is better and they just really rox....enjoy because i love them.
4,Between emo and elton john,"Something corporate is right up there among the few bands producing really good music right now. 'Leaving through the window' has a few songs you're going to want to skip over after a couple listens (particularly if you C jordan) but otherwise it is a great album, and worth getting if you can't download individual songs. My personal favorite is 'Hurricane', mostly because of the incredible power of the piano and drum bridge in the middle of the song. Try to get this song if you want a taste of the group. The piano sets Soco apart from most bands, but the other instruments hold their own. The style is between emo and elton john, and while the singing can get to be a touch whiny, overall the catchy melodies and instrumentals stand out to make this a great album. Check out their newer album 'north' if you like their stuff."
1,It's really bad,"There is not a single good song on the CD. I got this CD because I heard If U C Jordan and kinda liked it. I hate it now. It's not punk so i don't know why it got in this section. I don't know how it got five stars from other people. Don't buy it, it's a waste of your money"
2,nothing close to great,"I'm usually big into the pop-punk scene and emo bands, but these guys give pop punk a sour name. they're ok, but they're lyrics, with the exception of Konstantine, are mediocre at best. the piano does add a little bit to the music, but these guys can't come anywhere near competing with awesome bands like yellowcard, the starting line, or taking back sunday. work on the music guys, and good luck with the next cd, you don't have much of a chance at sucking more"
5,Ooo...I love this CD!,"Okay...Most of what I do listen to are Broadway things and such, but I do pay attention to rock. I'm rather aware that most people will not think me an accurate judge of this music, but who cares? It's nice.These songs are well-constructed musically and contain incitful lyrics that really stimulated my thought. Listening to the music, you can really understand what message is being conveyed through the song. This group is really going somewhere very good.I bought the Audioboxer EP on a whim since it was cheap ...and really enjoyed it, so I made sure I bought this one too...good decision. Though I'm really disappointed at the absense of ""Bad Day"" on this CD, which was my favorite on the EP, all of the songs on here are good, with my favorites being ""I Woke Up In A Car,"" ""The Astronaut,"" and ""Globes & Maps.""Buy this for some good piano/guitar-drive pop/rock."
1,Not 1 star... a ZERO! Poor Writing and Bad Ideas,"I cannot believe this man is selling books. His form of writing is aweful. Also, he refers to preschool children as ""the most selfish creatures God created."" Our sweet children are refered to as ""creatures."" Also, they are not selfish. At this stage in their lives they do not psychologically realise others also have feelings and needs. Lastly, to tell the readers that someone who wants to kill themselves should not seek help is terrible. This man needs to stop polluting the book shelves with his books."
3,Decent KVM for the money.,"We bought this KVM switch to run a server room with 12 computers in it. The price was very attractive, and it works pretty well. The keyboard and mouse work very well and it's easy to switch between computers via the front panel or keyboard shortcuts. However, we've noticed some interference in the video. Also, cables for this unit are very thick and dealing with excess length can be cumbersome, but once they're finally in place that's not an issue. Cables are sold separately in lengths of 15, 10, or 6 feet. We've only had this KVM installed for a couple of weeks, so we can't gauge it's reliability yet. All things considered, it's a decent unit for the price."
1,Where's the manufacturer?,Comfort Trend is not available to fix any problems you might have with these chairs. I've owned one for the past 10 years and still trying to get it to work. Good luck if you buy one of these and it breaks. The chase is on!
5,top of the line,I am proffesional drywall finisher and have been doing drywall finishing for 24 years I am very pleased with this bajo and believe it is the best that I have had.
5,This book is hilarious!,"......not for the narrow minded. Tom Robbins has such a creative, warped sense of humor. I love this book, because the underlying message is having self-esteem and maintaining it. It's amazing to me how Mr. Robbins, wrote this from a woman's perspective--the insecurities, naivete, challenges, and victories of women...and he is obviously a male. Great!"
1,"Skinny Legs beat Fat Thumbs, any day!","What were the publishers thinking? God, this is an awful thing.Mr/Dr Robbins has done to this work the same as his ""chink"" did to Sissy, the only problem being that the novel was not allowed the privilege of bathing in sunlight to relieve the abrasions.As Mr/Dr Robbins explains.....""...there is an explanation dying to catch the next bus downtown. The word cowgirls starts to form in your mouth, but it dissolves. Never mind. This is no time for explanations. Somebody had better call an ambulance.""Jeez, those sick publishers should have called an UNDERTAKER and buried this novel AND they should have interviewed EVERYONE on that bus for signs of trauma."
1,YUCK,"I did not know what to expect from this book, but it was just enough to get through this book. It was terrible! This book was far fetched, weird and just plain FREAKY!"
2,on and on and on and on,"I got this book because it was highly recommended by a college professor. I thought that it was entirely too wordy. I would skip through paragraphs because it was just too much. I thought the story plot was interesting and could have been fun to read, but Tom Robbins came off sounding pretentious because of his overuse of words. It could have been much better."
1,The Worst Book I Ever Read!,"This is by far the worst book I ever read. It was a selection of the book club to which my wife and I belong. Not surprisingly, others in our group were of the same opinion. If it weren't for our book club, I would not have finished the book. In fact, I would not have even read past the first 30 pages or so. Thumbs, thumbs, thumbs! Good God, is Mr. Robbins obsessed with thumbs? The story told in this book could have been written over 75 pages or so, not 364!Fortunately, our reading of this book prompted the adoption of a rule by our book club that future book selections be researched before we read them. Amen! I couldn't stand having to plow through another book like Cowgirls.Mr. Robbins seems like an intelligent man, but I would have to give this book 1 star. Give me a good novel like Cold Mountain any day!"
3,Not enough sparkle!!,"Sutton Foster is wonderful and she makes her numbers sound much better than they are.This is a stage adaptation of the hit 1967 film which was very thin and stretched to the breaking point by the bloated running time. The Broadway production tries hard...too hard in fact to inject energy into the proceedings. IT almost catches fire in a few numbers but the overall effect is pleasant. Just pleasant. Nothing more.RCA has done their usual high class job of recording and packaging the CD. The whole sore (and some welcome bits of dialogue) are laid out in show order. The booklet has background notes, a detailed synopsis, libretto and many pictures of the stage production."
5,EXCELLENT,"I saw this show opening night of previews back in April, and despite technical glitches and the typical transitional issues that naturally occur when putting a show together for the first time, I loved it. I wasn't thrilled with all of the casting choices, but Sutton Foster, Gavin Creel and Mark Kudish were amazing. This show had everything the movie didn't, not at all a satire of New York and the musical theatre scene, but instead a celebration of it. See it and buy the recording, no matter what you hear."
4,I guess the older propellers work better,I've noticed a bunch of complaints regarding the proplellers on Harold the Helicopter. My Harold is over eight years old and it still has his propellers in fine working order. My problem with Harold is the fact that there's not much to do with him. The new hospital track gives him a place to land but he gets boring quickly. Still a good buy though.
1,Tiny!,"I was expecting a decent sized toy but I received a tiny helicopter, very disappointed! I guess it's partly my fault as I should have done some research on the item, but the photo is very misleading."
1,Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway - Harold The Helicopter,"I was very dissapointed at the size, I thought it would of been alot bigger"
3,Mostly Plastic,"I'm not familiar with the Thomas the Train Wooden Railroad products, as my nephew has just discovered them and family is building him a collection, so these observations may be normal. First off, only the cabin of Harold is wooden, the rest is plastic. The tail boom is not a tight fit against the cabin. There is a serial number printed on his skids. I bought him b/c he wasn't a train and it seemed, from many reviews, that the children like him. I haven't opened the package, and I know a 2 year won't care, but my first glance was ""this seems too cheap even for China."" I was wrong, it's made in China. As an ironic note, there is a statement on the package that says ""Remove all plastic attachments before giving to child."" This would mean Harold would lose his tail, his face, his skids, his props, and his windows."
5,My son loves it!,"My son John LOVES to carry Harold around the house making jet noises (close enough, right?)This is a great little toy; the paint has held up well and the propellers have been durable so far. Nothing is cooler to a little boy than something that flies!"
1,"Junk, junk, junk!","It's amazing how that saying ""you get what you pay for"" rings so true to this product. It is total junk, and the reason I gave it one star (even though 0 stars is not an option) is because it kinda sounds like a goose...a sick, retarded, dying goose. And the ""double cluck"" feature means you can blow through and suck through while still producing a sound. You will probably never hear a professional caller say this is a viable and good concept.If you want a decent call for low $, try the Zink PC-1. Sorry to write such a negative review...in fact, I actually hope everyone buys and uses these calls...that way there will be more geese for me and my buddies!!!"
5,Best Book on Frassati,Best book on PG I've read so far. Both inspirational and informative. Other books have tended to be to biased and unbalanced. Very well worth the read.
5,LOVE this book!!!,"I love this book! So many great ideas!! I can't believe the other reviewers didn't like it as much as me................Ton of great ideas, I can't wait to use! I highly recommend!"
3,Page Ideas,"I didn't realize how old this idea book was. A lot of the layouts are very outdated, but I can always 'tweak' them to make them better. It won't be the first idea book I reach for, though."
3,Not the colors in the ad...,They work for what they are intended for but the colors shown are not the colors received. I got dish cloths with black and navy blue stripes on it. There was no yellow or green or light blue. This was the second order that the wrong color of the items has been rec'd.
4,"Good book, good service.",The book was delivered quickly and is a good read. I hope he writes another.
1,Embarrassingly Silly,"I watched the first Happy Feet and found it cute until the end when it just turned into ridiculous environmentalist preaching. This one didn't even have the plus of starting out well. I would give it a 0 if that option was available. Bad, jumbled storyline, horrible music even if you like that kind of music, characters with limp personalities. Not even Robin Williams' talent could pull this one out of the junk pile."
4,a film well worth viewing and owning,"This was a very enjoyable production. The animation was excellent and the story line appealing. It would be best to see this film on a large theater screen, but I still enjoyed it very much."
1,Horrifying! Don't bother - too boring for words,"Who knows what the writers were thinking with this one. the plot, the story, whatever is so convoluted, so packed with ""messages"" and such a downer to watch you'll want to jump off a cliff. I think Al Gore was a ghost writer. Mostly boring, a few amusing parts, WAY too heavy handed. There is no joy in this movie whatsoever. Don't bother. Your kids will be bored after 5 minutes and you'll be running for the shotgun if you are forced to watch the whole thing!"
1,Crap,Very disappointing movie. It was not entertaining in the least -- I feel like I wasted my money and time.
1,"Boring. boring, boring......",This movie didn't entertain anyone of any age for even minutes. It is a boring embarrassment to all penguins everywhere!
1,Stupidest movie ever,"i watched half an hour of his non sense and the only story in it was about penguins dancing, and expressing their feelings for each other. The story is boring, retarded and pathetic, and i remember when it came out so many people wanted to see it, and some asked me; hey did you see happy feet? and i reply Yeah that boring piece of trash... This is the dumbest movie ever it is long, boring, offensive, and wastes your time."
2,90 minute scarefest for kids,"Saw this with my daughter when she was four. Didn't go over well. Not to spoil the storyline, but being separated from your parents, being chased down by a penguin eating sea lion, Losing your will from being imprisoned in a zoo, all the while being treated as an ugly duckling character, talking the kid down(no we won't leave you, no there are no human eating sea lions...) took just as long...I can understand the whole overcoming challenges in life and coming of age stories, but very depressing for a movie made for kids..."
4,Great!,"Great family movie. If your kids love a good story and music, then you'll all love this movie."
3,"DVD is not read in format, only in HDDVD","DVD is not read in format, only in HDDVD and it I have tried it in several readers.??"
4,"Beautiful animation, lovely music, excellent family movie","Our whole family, 14 of us, went together to see Happy Feet on Thanksgiving eve, from the youngest, 5 years, to me, the 66 year-old-grandmother. We were all thrilled with its beauty, and came out singing the songs. The only weakness was the storyline but the visuals and the music were so magical they made up for that. Our youngest was enchanted and went into a penguin drawing frenzy for the rest of the weekend. Bravo to the artists, the director, and all who put Happpy Feet together. It is a masterpiece."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"I didn't hate this as much as some people did, but it was not that entertaining to me either. It was cute idea, but they really messed it up. The kids probably won't like it. I don't know what audience they were aiming for, but this movie fails for any audience. I didn't think the animation was all that wonderful when compared to many other current animated films.Skip this one and get: ""Ice Age, The Meltdown"" instead. It's a much better movie, a lot funnier, much more upbeat and everyone will love it."
4,Birthday gift for my daughter,"I cannot watch this whole movie without falling asleep.. I've tried a few times.. My kids however, they love it.. and I guess thats what counts, right?"
1,shame,"We took our kids to see this movie, assuming that it would a be cute and upbeat KIDS movie. The propaganda was so in your face that it puts Bambi to shame. If you want your children to be unecessarily scared by a number of animals with large teeth, then take them to see this movie. If you want your children to learn that their elders are out of touch and full of nonsense, take them to see this movie. If you want your children to cry because they eat fishsticks, take them to see this movie. If you want your children to carry guilt for going to the zoo, take them to see this movie. It's one thing to knowingly pay to see Farenheight 911, it's a whole 'nother thing to pay for propaganda unknowingly and to submit children to it.When we walked out of the theater, I asked our kids what the movie was about. ""Scary animals?"", ""Bad people who steal penguins food?"". The fluffy and cute main character didn't even stick out to them. What a waste of money and time."
2,The 2 Stars Are For Robin Williams...,"...because he was the only good thing about this movie. This movie had like, 6 plot changes! Mumble as the social misfit, Mumble and Gloria in love, but then things don't work out perfectly for some reason, Mumble being rejected by his people..... and several other little side things. It was really, really hard to follow.Robin Williams played like, 5 characters and they all were hilarious. It was the only part of the movie that was not in line with the stupid enviromentalist agenda that was being forced into the innocent minds of kids. Why would you have a movie(made for humans)about humans being the evil ones? Should we all go hug a tree and ask it to turn us into penguins?This movie is warped. Watch Surf's Up--it's funnier, keeps to the ONE plot from begining to end, and is much more worth your time and money than this brain-cell killing crud."
1,EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS,Dont order from this seller!! i ordered happy feet from him and never recieved it and to this day still trying to get my money back!
3,Happy Feet,"This was a alright movie, with all the hype I expected more, didn't keep my daughters attention."
2,Why the Oscars are irrelevant,"Beautiful animation. Some good music. A few funny and entertaining scenes. At times, beats the viewer about the head and shoulders with it's anit-religion and environmental messages. Not in the same league as 'Cars', which should have won the best animated movie Oscar. However, it had a message that the academy members found agreeable, so the better movie was ignored in the name of political correctness."
2,Real boring for adults,I normally like the animated movies that are coming out but this one just could not keep me awake. The music was fun yes but I could barely understand what they were saying when they were talking. Kids would probably be better off just having the soundtrack then sitting thru this snoozefest.
2,I'll give it an extra star for the cinematography...,"But the goofy ""Everyone hug a tree for Mother Gaia"" ending spoils this silly trip."
1,I wish I had never seen this movie,"Happy Feet was anything but happy for me. The social messages ruined the movie for me, along with the sexually suggestive scene. The big killer though is the zoo scene. The zoo scene bothered me so much that I decided not to renew my season pass to the local zoo.I wish I had never seen this movie. I walked out of this movie feeling very sad."
3,Thought it would be more for children.,"I purchased this DVD for my great-nephew for Christmas because he is into watching animated movied. While I watched this movie, one of which I purchased for my own viewing, I was horrified that I had bought this for a 2-year old. I had no idea there would be quite so much adult content. I wish there was a coding or grading setup so that unsuspecting people such as myself would know this up front."
4,Good Fun,"I adored this movie in the theaters. It's still good, and the scene selection is fairly precise which is also useful. The extras aren't overwhelming, but it's all very good fun."
1,A Shrill Leftist Screed,"A shrill, sometimes dark, traumatizing leftist screed involving nasty religious penguins, good nonreligious younger hip-hop penguins singing about nappy hair, penguins with harems, young penguins singing about wanting each others' bodies, overfishing, dementia ... this movie is not for kids.The style is semi-realistic, i.e. not very cartoonish, which was strange - not a good artistic choice. You've probably seen the plot summarized already. This is not a good movie night for the whole family, unless these are the values you want to instill."
1,Family Film? Yeah Right!,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. All my friends loved it so I said to myself, it's probaly a cute movie, let's go see it. Boy was I wrong. First off, it starts off weird. The songs are completely inappropriate for the kids who watch this. Every other second the penguins start singing. The seconds they're not, they talk about how hungry they are. (News flash: penguins aren't endagered.) But what really bothered me was how political it was. They get the parents in there with there kids and then they force this message on them that humans are destroying penguins! And I will admit, I'm a tree-hugger. But this movie was uncalled for."
1,Where is the button for -0- stars?!,"Thinly veiled attempt to push politically correctness down the throats of our children, sacrificing the faith and beliefs of their elders in the attempt. Aren't we so fortunate to have filmmakers to teach our children for us what their priorities and beliefs should be? Oh pleeeeze! I'm so glad I could watch this one with my daughter so I could point out the obvious attempts at manipulation. We discussed the issues, and thought for ourselves."
3,just okay,"My daughter loves Happy Feet 2, and we think it is much better than the first one. Not worth the $10."
1,not so great,"The cd I received does not have the ability to go to the menu. I don't know what is wrong with it, but it does not look like a real cd movie."
5,Excellent educational content,"One of the most inspirational animated films I have ever seen. Touching and profound in content, it brings about topics such as discrimination, xenophobia, tradition, family, and more important, love.With an entertaining environment, it lets us become a part of the story and have the opportunity to do something about it."
5,Thought-provoking and entertaining,"I watched this dvd with my 3 year old. I am very glad that I screened the movie previously and selected only age appropriate scenes for her. I was disturbed, but in a good way, about the destruction of the Antarctic ecosystem, melting ice, no food, etc. In all the movies I have seen, I have never seen a seal that looked so evil as the one in this movie. Seals do eat penguins, you know. It was depicted much like sharks are. My daughter loved what she saw of it. I would say to expect questions from older children though. There were also some comments that may not be appropriate for all children either, even though this is an animated movie. (Those of you who watch South Park will understand.) Viewing this movie as a family would be a good way to discuss the current ecological situation in the Arctic and Antarctic."
4,For older children,Wonderful animation. But environmental message lost on ages 3 & 5 children. The ending was confusing to them.
2,Not a fan,"Like the other posters I have to give this two stars simply for the animation. It is a beautiful looking movie. However, the plot is confusing and uninteresting. The political message is not subtle and takes away from the fun parts of the movie. I was also disgusted by the blatent sexual content. Why is that necessary in what is billed as a children's movie? Overall, I just was not impressed."
4,Thomas toy,"This item looked much larger in the picture than it actually was. I was surprised at the size, but I should have known by the price and if I had been more familiar with the product."
3,This is a bitty toy,"I bought this for my 2 year old nephew. I had stupidly not paid attention to the size of the toy. This is a bitty toy. About the size of a hot wheel car. Looking at the price and the picture, I was thinking it was a big toy, about 8 inches long or so. for a toy this small is a little high. I just wanted to warn any other potential buyers about the size."
4,good.,"my daughter whenever she goes to the barns & noble..loves to play with the train..it was on sale,,,so cheap...bought 2 of it.good..."
5,Thomas is wonderful,Thomas is ranked high for a reason. Children love him. If your children enjoy Thomas you should definitely buy this for them. Very cute & a perfect size to carry around.UPDATE: I thought it was important to note that only after a week of having Thomas the paint on the top corners have worn off. There hasn't been any rough play so definitely wasn't very happy about that. Just wanted to provide the feedback. Percy hasn't done this yet....fingers crossed he doesn't.
5,2 yr old son loves it,My son loves this toy. It is beautifully made and just the perfect size for a toddlers hands.
2,Very disappointing.,"I read and deeply enjoyed Robbin's first 5 books, so picked this one up with a sense of anticipation. The merciful thing is that I was quickly disappointed and not left lingering for hope. It was readable, barely, and there were some clever plot devices and ideas, but the whole thing didn't hang together, seemed very silly and contrived, and pretty insulting since it was 2nd person and 'you' are apparently a shallow stockbroker who dosen't know herself at all.Read his other books, skip this one. Even if you're a fan."
3,Hafl Asleep is What TR Was When He Wrote This,"Either TR is losing some punch or I am not as infatuated with his style as I once was. I found this an enteraining read with some thoughtful moments, but nothing spectacular."
4,A great read for the muddled mind!,"I really enjoyed this book, it was not only a highly entertaining story but it offers a wake-up call to the reader along the way. Great reading for anytime, anywhere and any place. Tom Robbins does a great job of exploring the female character in this novel and it's a thrill ride from start to finish in the novel. Mystery and mayhem at it's best.If you like to read something exciting that will make you laugh and offer you some real insight along the way, then you'll probably love this book.Also I think this is my favourite book title of all time."
4,Not For The Self-Righteous,"While I agree with others that perhaps this is not Mr. Robbins' best novel, I disagree with their assesment of why. A book written in the 2nd person (""you"") can only be offensive if you're not willing to find a part of the protagonist in yourself. True, she can be quite hateful at times, but her selfishness, guilt, desire for money and views on the world, when taken in their smallest aspects, can be found in all of us. This is what I found fascinating about the novel: it forced me to confront my own selfishness. Beyond all that soul searching, it's beautifully written and Gwen's struggle with her sexuality will elict many a giggle from those of us slightly more.. ahem.. experienced. If you are very proud of yourself or loathe the idea of identifying with a filipina stockbroker, go check out Oprah's book club. ""Frog Pajamas"" will not suit you."
1,A RIP OFF,"A good short SHORT story, but $11.99 for about a 45 minute read is a rip-off!I have learnt to check the page count carefully in future."
3,The Shepherd,A few technical discrepancies spoiled The Shepherd for me. A disappointment coming from such a producer of otherwise fine stories.
5,Very short novel... and very good!,"This is, simpy put, one of my favorite readings of all time.This very short novel is engaging, exciting and very well written. Forsyth showed that he's more than one of the best thriller writers of all time."
2,A Hot Mess,"The baby in the picture looks so adorable but our son looked like an adorable hot mess. This costume is 0-6 months but our almost 5 month old was swimming in it when we tried it on him around halloween. We bought it early and figured by Halloween he would fit in better. It was uncomfortable looking and a sea of leopard print, red, and nude materials. It was hard to make out exactly what it was. the baby hated it, he couldn't find his hands to get to his teething mouth with all the material. Needless to say, we nixed it. Perhaps if I cut out some room for legs, it will look food on him next year."
5,A bible for Sooner football fans,"This book is something to be revered by Sooner fans. Barry's recounts of the great games and great people around OU's glorious runs in the 70s and 80s bears reading. I just re-read the book after keeping it down for a few years, and it just gets better with time. If any of you out there need ammo for those Barry bashers, you need this book. Barry Switzer is a great man, and every Sooner fan should remember that.Barry covers his childhood, personal struggles, and his years at Arkansas. He then talks about those great 70s teams that we know get to see on ESPN Classic.Probably the most interesting part is his line item by line item response to every NCAA violation that OU was found guilty of. Barry pulls no punches and is not afraid to admit guilt where he saw it. His candidness is something special.You might find this book hard to find, but try your hardest and hit the auction sites, etc, you should be able to turn it up, and you won't be sorry."
1,Only good for full circles...,"I bought two of these from Amazon. After using them for a week, the collar rings which control how far left and right the sprinkler rotates started to move along with the sprinkler head. They are simple tensioned metal clips that are easily stripped/sprung after a couple of uses. They are not the clips/rings that are shown in the picture. The ones shown in the picture are similar to the one Rainbird puts on their sprinklers (which are much better quality). So in essence, they are falsely advertised here on the web. I contacted Nelson customer service for replacement collars or sprinklers and they said they could not help me! Very nice!! Oh, and these sprinklers also say MADE IN CHINA...this would explain the poor quality. Nelson is now off my list of manufacturers to buy from."
4,Great phone - could use a few little enhancements,Pros:- best pictures yet (3.2 mega pixels) on a cell phone that I have used- built in flash (rare for cell cameras)- cover over lens on camera- good music player- expandable memory with Sony M2 flash memory- fm radio- bluetooth works great- screen has great size and wonderful resolution- EDGE device makes internet data fairly quick and usable as PC modem (via bluetooth)Cons:- keys are small and difficult to press- camera lens cover needs a lock switch (mine opens just walking around and takes pictures of the lint in my pocket) - very annoying- sleep timer is a bit quick and should be adjustable- I shouldn't expect it thinner since it is the size of a very small digital camera but I'd still like it slimmer.P
4,supreme convinience,"yo0o0o wassup~ this phone is tight.. i mean, it's really well designed and has many functions in an attempt to be a ""all in one"" product. well, i believe sony ericsson delivered because it saves me the trouble of carrying any other devices to accommodate my needs ~ i recently purchased a 2gig M2 memory card and it's tight work, i'm satisfied. this phone is all i carry when i'm out in the real world."
5,Ignore the Negative Reviews!,The Joy Luck Club is not about Chinese people. It is about every one of us - you and me! It is an universal story PERIOD!
5,This is one of my favorite books....ever,"Words can't express how much I love this book. It is definitely a page turner. I read this for the first time 7 years ago, and I can't even remember how many times more after that. It is an easy read with a great story. Whenever I travel anywhere, have to wait for a meeting, or just have some time to kill, ""The Joy Luck"" club is book I always grab."
3,JOURNAL #6,"Even though i enjoyed reading the novel somewhat, I gave Joy Luck Club 3 stars because in the beginning of the book, it was very difficult to understand what was going on. It was also difficult to differentiate between who was who's mother/daughter. Also, at times, the story just seemed to drag. However, there were other parts in the novel that were very interesting. I would have liked it better all together if it would have put it together like the movie in the sense that the daughters' and mothers' stories were ""back-to-back"". This way, it was much easier to understand who is related to who and keeping the stories tied in together."
1,This book was too boring and did not interest me at all.,Amy did alright for this being her first book but she jumped around too much and I lost track of it. It was too boring and I actually got lost in parts of the book because I was just not interested. I had to a midterm paper on it and I couldn't really say anything good about it. I would definitely not recommend this book to anybody I know.
5,An amazing and rare peek into the powerful Chinese culture!,"I am a 12 year girl who read this book at ten, and have read it 4 times since! I find something more profound each time, such as humility, obedience, etc. It has given great interest in Chinese culture, and has inspired me to write my own story of a Chinese family. Absolutely Spellbinding! (Callie Collins)"
1,they were out of stock,"I ordered this book to replace a lost library book.It never arrived and I got an e-mail they were out of stock.With today's technology, why wasn't this info available when I placed the order?I would have ordered it somewhere else."
4,Fascinating but not profound,"I found this book to be highly readable and to stand as an important example of immigrant and post-immigrant fiction. The Chinese-American experience is different from the Jewish-American experience or the Irish-American experience, but they also have a great deal in common. Tan successfully portrays the younger generation's desire to conform to American ideals and the older generation's often stubborn resistance to acculturation. Somewhere in between lies a happy medium that is often not attained until a third or fourth generation.My only gripe is not with the book itself but with the notion that this is a profound work of literature that needs to be taught in high school or even college classes. I see it as excellent popular fiction, which is a major achievement, but not as a book for the ages."
3,Mothers and their daughters,"This book and The Kitchen God's Wife, also by Ms. Tan, are very similar in terms of theme and mood. There were multiple generations of women, each of whom didn't entirely understand the struggles the other went through. This was an interesting study of how we can interact with and communicate with another person, without ever understanding them completely."
1,Boring,I needed to read this for school.... I hated every second of it especially because the book requires you to really over think it to string everything together. By far the worst book I've read.
4,From a 17 year old's perspective...,"This was a great book. Although at times it may seem kind of random and challenging to follow, if you stick with it, it will all come together in the end. Amy Tan does a wonderful job of narration for all of the different characters in the book. From this book you learn many things about the Chinese culture that you cannot learn anywhere else. You also see how mothers from one country raising children in another cope with all of the changes. Overall this was a fantastic book."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was a bit disappointed in this book. Each chapter has a different narrator, and between 8 women, it is hard to remember which one was which. I found it a little difficult to keep up with who was who, even at the end. The stories didn't all come together like I was hoping. The book was good, but it wasn't something that I was anxious to get home to."
4,A great description of an Asian American's family lifestyle,"This book was enjoyable to read because the author used lots of simple dialogue to familiarize the reader, while ahe also used a lot of descriptive words to allow the reader to fully actually ""see"" the settings and scenes of the story. The novel had a lot of beautiful metaphors and at times also had a sort of poetic tone to it, but it also had simple dialogue to tone down the mood so the reader could relate to the different stories. Overall, I could relate to all the stories perfectly well as an Asian American myself, so I thought it was pretty accurate and it was beautifully and simply written. The only negative thing about the novel would be that sometimes you could get mixed up with all the different stories."
2,What's on Mr. Keneally's Mind?,"In the first hundred pages of this novel, which is lauded for its realistic portrayal of southeners during the Civil War, there are at least two dozen references to human excrement, and nearly that many to lice. The characters of this book squat behind bushes, discuss diarrhea, foul their water supply, have problems with what they step in, and pick lice. Sort of a scratch and squat version of the Civil War. A remarkable number of the characters are drunks, or thieves, or least liars. We are informed, repeatedly, that they smell bad. Spit dribbles down their chins. The women are loose, or mean. Get the picture? Reality equals ugliness, and this book is about reality."
2,Rodan/War of trhe Gargantuas,"It just wasn't worth the money. The special effects were terrible, even for the time frame this movie came from. I felt like I wasted my money."
5,"""The words get stuck in my throat"".","""War of"" is a great movie, the ""darkness' that everyone's talking about in the Japanese version is not a problem, it adds to the mood. And of course, ""Rodan"" is a classic..."
5,review,it was just as I remembered it.....a lot of fun!!! -dramatic music adds to the movie-you get 2 for the price of one- a must have for the sci-fi movie collector.
2,EXCELLENT however....,"The book itself is great! However the copy I received when purchasing is not. I received an Examination Copy.For those that do not know what an examination Copy is... An Examination Copy is a book that's sent out from the publisher for free to teachers and other people in an attempt to sell the book. Upon sending this book out to potential customers, it is suppose to be on a basic level of understanding that the book will not be sold. The reason being is because it takes away from well deserved royalties that belong to the author and publisher. Someone profited from the book I purchased where the publisher/author has not. This is slightly disappointing."
2,poorly written,"I had to use this book for a communications class. It is poorly written, there are probably twice as many typos as any other textbook. The definitions on the sides of the pages are never consistent: some may actually describe the word and some may pull a phrase out of context from a sentence that has the word in it--or some simply give you a link to a website. I wish my professor had used another book."
1,"This book is really, really bad for educationa purpose","I am using the tenth edition of this book and let me tell you something: It's the worst textbook I've ever come across. The writing is rudimentary, the formatting and grammar looks like it was outsourced to an unpaid high schooler. Finally, the author always uses his own ""point-of-view"" description to describe a situation. This book honestly feels like a coffee table conversation more than an educational piece."
2,don't buy.,These were a waste of money and I had to hide them from my 2 year old because they fustrated him so bad. Of course like everyone else said they don't fit in the tunnels but if you pull the cars empty they are too light and constantly tip over going up hills. If you have a flat track and no tunnels they would work.
5,fun with animal car,They are fun. I play with them a lot. I like the animals in the cicus trains and pushing them around the tracks.
2,"Fun but not well integrated with rest of ""Thomas"" stuff","Quality of animals is good except that some animals have a face on each side... toddlers notice and wonder why.The three cars, while cute, are much lighter than the other solid wood engines and cars... they do not stay on the track and de-rail on a regular basis... frustrates the careful toddler.The cars, when loaded with animals will not fit in tunnels, go over bridges or allow cars to enter the roundhouse... so, the animals usually just get left off the cars by the toddler."
4,Lots of fun... but size is a problem!,"My son recently received the Circus Train for his 2nd birthday. He was really excited to see the animals, and loves to put them in the cage cars and drive them around the track. He has been very frustrated, however, because his train can't fit through any tunnels or bridges when the animals are on board - the animals are just too tall. I think the Circus Train would be a great addition to your Thomas Wooden Railway IF you don't have the bridges or tunnels to worry about. If you do have these items in your layout, I'd suggest the Ivo Hugh zoo set instead, as it is made to fit through those low clearance areas."
2,??,"Car was ""very fun"" on the glossy flat mall floor we first saw them in.My kids really don't get it to work at all on the concrete sidewalk, street or driveway.We don't use it."
2,Forgot to say CANNOT USE ON HARDWOOD FLOORS!!,"Ordered this for my daughters ninth birthday. We received it and set-up was easy. As I read through the directions, at the BOTTOM of the page, there was a warning about using the car on hardwood floors. It said the car will scratch/and or damage the floors and should not be used! This important info was not included in any description or promotional materials or advertisements about the car. She was very upset and couldn't ride it outside-it is December! We had to send it back :("
1,Review About Amazon/MMP LLC,"I wish I was able to review the product, but unfortunately I received a USED product from Amazon/MMP LLC although I bought a plasma car that was clearly labeled ""NEW."" I received the package in a brown Amazon box, rather than the manufacturer's box. The car clearly looked like it had been put together before and taken apart. The body of the car was scuffed. The previous user also did a poor job of repackaging the parts and one of the bags was tied together by green curling ribbon. Ugh. I bought this for my daughter's birthday and now I need to send it back and I don't have time to receive another one in the mail. Very disappointed with Amazon and MMP LLC."
1,Book in terrible condition!,"I bought this book, along with another one, Noisy Day. This book, however came tattered, and with colored crayon marks on all of the pages. It was in terrible terrible condition, and I was so disappointed. It was in such bad condition that I had to just throw it away."
3,Not Bad,"There were a lot of songs in the movies that I hoped would be on this CD, but they weren't. For the most part, it is pretty good."
5,Great Grips.,"I replaced my standard plastic P-13 grips with these Hogue grips, and they are very nice. I wish that they were available when my gun was new. Perfect fit and a 5 minute job to put on."
3,"eh, good seller, but product doesn't work","There is not a thing wrong with the ring itself, it is exactly what I thought I was getting and showed up on time. But it doesn't serve it's purpose well. Because the plastic of the ring is so long (it slides around and catches on things a lot) and a little abrasive(like a thick gauge fishing wire) I ended up with an infection anyway that I didn't seem to be able to clear no matter what I used to clean it, without giving up and taking the ring out. I have had my piercing for 10 years and never an infection even though I have not always used rings made of appropriate metals or taken great care, but this ring irritated within hours. Possibly if you start using it soon enough the skin will toughen to it and you can avoid this, but because my belly was already pretty big when I switched to this one, the ring would rub and really had no hope of working."
2,"Too much violence, not enough love","This may turn out to be a brilliant multi-volume story, but I'm not going to read past the first volume, because I found it too violent. I have a hard time relating to characters (like Dai) who treat the people they love like crap. And I have a hard time understanding how his man could fall for him, considering how badly Dai treated him. Just because he is good-looking, and leads a gang, that makes Dai hot somehow? It's just not working for me. I wanted more sweetness and light, less torture scenes."
3,A Slight Disappointment,"After having read two or three great novels by Sidney Sheldon, Master of the Game was a slight disappointment. The story was too predictable. The last book of the novel was the best. The book is worth reading...but I wouldn't read it twice as I've done other books."
5,Master Storyteller,"I have to say that this is the best book I've read yet. This book has so many twists and turns and just keeps you wanting to read more. I love Sheldon's style of writing, cause I never get bored, EVER!!!! Sheldon's writing is unlike other authors, cause the one thing that Sheldon is able to do is keep the reader constantly interested in the book. There wasn't a moment in this book and his others that I got bored, felt was dull, or wanted to skip. What I'm saying isn't an exaggeration either. If you read this book and Sheldon's others, then you'll find out for yourself the truth."
5,Nobody Can Tell a Story Like S.Sheldon,I would recommend this book to anybody that likes to read and also those that don't.Once you turn the first page you can't put it down.
5,A Gripping Story,"I loved this book. I found Cat a very appealing character, and the story of her troubled childhood brought a lump to my throat. Right from the atmospheric opening, when carol singers arrive at Cat's house, the world of the story is vividly evoked. Margaret Leroy writes beautifully - the book is full of delicately described detail and sensitively observed relationships, and the love between mother and child is tenderly depicted. From the beginning, there is a sense of unease, with hints that this perfect world is going to fall apart. As the trap started to close around Cat, I found myself reading raptly, completely gripped by the story."
5,Great book!,I am a fan of Margaret Leroy and pass on the books to my sister when I finish them. I really enjoyed this one.
3,"great concept, not always great delivery 3.5 stars","I may be the only one to feel this way, but I have to say I was more impressed by what the author intended than by what he achieved. When the writing works (reflections on his meanderings across a physical and psychological landscape), it is wildly successful. Some sections had me gushing appreciation for the author's insights and masterly descriptions. Other sections, however, made me wish that a good editor had stepped in to remind the author that he was, ultimately, writing for an audience beyond the mirror."
3,Not for the beginer,"As someone who is new to C++ I found this book was hard to follow for an introduction book, even after learning the basics of C++. On the positive side the code examples in the book were all well written and complied without any trouble.Topics covered are Windows Programming, MFC, Database Access, ActiveX controls, Com and ATL. A lot of space is dedicated to showing how to use the wizards that come with C++.For an experienced C++ programmer moving onto windows programming it may be helpful but otherwise I would suggest an easier book."
5,"It's a memory card,...","Hahah, it works great as a memory card, has lasted well, but it's still just a memory card. Treat it well, it could outlast your camera."
2,Not a good value for the price,"Great product but completely overpriced. Can get 20 bands, rather than the 3 described here, for the same price elsewhere."
1,Terrible Picture,I have always wanted to see this movie. But I was really mad at the qulity of the the picture. It was the worst picture ever release to dvd. I had to get a refund because it was unwatchable. I agreed with the other review. Wild Eye Releasing should fix this problem because people who want to see rare tv movies should have the chance.
1,Truly appalling,"Whoever was in charge of releasing this to the buying public should be shot. I'm not referring to the standard of the film itself (which is bad enough) but the quality of the print. In mine, the color was bright orange, there were numerous video dropouts, and it was so blurry it could have been filmed through a bucket of vaseline. As for the shark sequences: were they filmed in someone's swimming pool? There is absolutely NO excuse for a disc of this atrocious quality being released for sale."
5,Greatest Show of All Time,"This is the greatest show ever!! A lot of people think since its an old show, old people like it.... totally not true.. i am 20, its the greast show in the world. I have bought every- half season... ya it stinks but in my opinion which is probably why its so spendy is because people like me will totally spend the outragouse amount of money on it.... but honestly i read someon's comment about older people dying before the last disk is realeased.. agree. im worried i wont be around long enough to watch em all!... their is like tons of seasons!.. and if they would come outa little faster that would sure be nice!... seems like every 6-9 months.. and then they had to have a reunion set come out in the middle so its taking forever to get to see new ones..."
2,Incomplete,"I agree, Five stars for the show. But until the studios release the entire collection I can't justify spending money on something that's not complete but advertised as such!? Enjoyed the show but come on what would Perry say?"
1,I'm reluctantly joining the Boycott,I've been waiting for years for the full release of this series. This insulting Third Season release will not get my money. All the valid points have been made in previous reviews. I'll wait and do without until the robber barons at Paramount change their ways or I die without having owned the full series
3,An Okay Book,"This is enjoyable, but not Tan's best work. I preferred both The Joy Luck Club and The Kitchen God's Wife. In The Hundred Secret Senses, the characters are sporadically uninteresting or hard to identify with--but then they will suddenly become compelling. I wouldn't recommend it very strongly, but I don't regret reading it."
2,The Hundred Secret Scenses,I did not care for the book. I found it confusing and could not get into the characters. I rarely do not finish a read but with this one I did.
2,Not like her other gems~,"I have read all Amy Tan's other books and she is really my favorite author, but I could not get into this book at all. It was almost like someone else had written it."
2,Not enough character description,"I didn't think the characters were described very well and I never felt like I really knew them. I also didn't like that sometimes Olivia, the main character, did not believe her sister and sometimes she did. It also annoyed me that she wasn't able to communicate what she was really feeling about her husband."
4,satisfactory for several audiences,I chose to read this book because I was going to visit San Francisco and wanted to read a book set there. It met that need pretty well but I was pleased to find that it had much more to recommend it. The relationship between the two sisters was unusual and wonderfully rendered. The surprising spiritual aspect at the end added an intriguing dimension. I do suspect that women will enjoy it more than men.
5,Like two extra hands,"These are great, I used them yesterday to put togeter some cabinets. They held the two parts together untill I had put in some brads. The springs are strong and hold the timber very solidly. Get yourself a pair !"
4,Potential weakness in design,"I bought 2 sets of these clamps. I've used these type before. To me they are an absolute necessity for anyone putting 2 pieces of wood together (3/4' or less).In my first use of these Jet clamps one of the clamps from each set broke. One clamp has red plastic, the other black. The black plastic broke on a line between the screws that hold it to the spring metal. And both black clamps broke.When I contacted the supplier they immediately called back and offered my money back or a replacement. I didn't think twice about accepting the replacement, because they are great tools., I was told if they broke again I could ge a refund. What's better than that?"
5,I can't put it back on the rack!,"I bought it about two years ago, and I have yet to put it back on the rack. It's always one of the ten I always carry in my car just in case I'm stranded along the freeway, or if aliens zap me and my car to the planet Zoltar. I have to have it with me at all times. I am shocked that Himmelman is not a huge star. All the same, I prefer knowing that he isn't. His lyrics are the perfect combination of truth, wit, and compassion. Buy this CD and you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this guy. Just tell a few friends, though. I'd hate to have the whole world know how incredibly original and refreshing he is."
4,Simple & Effective,"The LR Nelson 2311 Simple Soaker does the job for my 40 foot long border area. It was easy to install( took about 20 minutes ). One con is that the plastic stakes are a bit fragile, they will break if someone stepped on it & applied pressure, so you have to be careful. The sprinkler sprinkles about a 2 foot diameter. The system has ony 5 sprinkers, I wish they would add 1 or 2 more as 5 is not enough to do the job for me."
4,Amulet Obsession: A Review,"I have found this book to be invaluable. In fact, this is the second book I am buying because mine has disappeared and I can't be without it. The amulet bags are very interesting and detailed. I found her use of beads for fringes and straps to be the best I have seen anywhere. It has been a wonderful learning book for me, and helped me to grow in my beading skills and creative ideas."
4,Enjoy the sounds of silence with your children.,"A simple idea, to listen. But we forget the magic that there is in ""first times"". Do you remember the first time you heard a cricket sing? Probably not, but after you read this book, it won't matter - you will feel like every time you hear a cricket, and many other sounds in your world, its your first time again.An invaluable lesson for children growing up with MTV, the Internet, billboards, and multimedia lessons in school. This book helps you and your child to ""unplug"" and relax long enough to really hear the world around you."
5,Gene in '62,"Yes I jnow it may be a little commercial,but the musicians play very well,and seem to be enjoying thmeselves. The price was nice. Thanks, Amazon"
2,Campy of not quality copy,I heard about this musical as being very campy and a part of the free love era. Parts are funny but quality of the DVD is like an old movie that has never been remastered.
2,Not what I expected,"My DVD must have come from the same batch as the viewer in Alexandria (though mine isn't a screener, I actually purchased mine)! The DVD isn't all that.Let me start by saying that I've been a big fan of Bruce Kimmel's work since I purchased my first Spotlight Series CD. So of course I couldn't wait to purchase this DVD, and yes, now I (unfortunately) own it. Somehow, this wasn't what I was expecting. I have a sense of humor just as much as the next person, but didn't expect Mr. Kimmel's work to be quite so perverted. I mean, you have an idea of what to expect hence the title, but give me a break! It was disappointing to hear Mr. Kimmel's music, not what I'd expect of him, you'd think he would have so much talent, but obviously song writing isn't his strong suit. So beware when purchasing this DVD, it's not something I'd ever want to see again to tell you the truth. It's too bad, since I was really looking forward to it."
3,Cult musical comedy finally available and worth the wait,"As with the original Little Shop of Horrors, technical quality is not the issue here. This silly little film represents at least a minor landmark in cinema history and now that it's available on DVD, everyone can judge for themselves. Schlock doesn't begin to describe the technical aspects, but Cindy Williams is a delight as Rosie the Secretary, giving a performance alternately subtle and outrageous. Years of Laverne and Shirley may have done more harm than good to her overall reputation, but this film shows that she could have been the equal of Goldie Hawn in films.Lots of special features in the DVD (including several Easter Eggs), but grab one soon, as the bonus soundtrack CD will not be included in later pressings."
4,Apple Tree Christmas a beautiful tale for all seasons,"In Apple Tree Christmas, Trinka Hakes Noble gives us a glimpse into her own childhood, although the setting is a Midwestern farm in 1881. Katrina is a budding artist, whose favorite ""studio"" is the old apple tree. Here she gets her best ideas and dreams of the future. After a blizzard/ice storm, the apple tree is no longer standing. Katrina can't believe that Father and Mother are happy to use its old branches for firewood. Nothing seems right anymore, and even Christmas doesn't feel happy. But Christmas morning brings a surprise for our young artist. Mrs. Noble's illustrations are lovely, filled with much detail of life before the turn of the century -- life without all of our modern conveniences. Be sure to add this book to your collection!"
5,Excellent tires... best bang for the buck !!,These are excellent quality tires. I notice the difference in the ride immediately after putting them on but then again my older Dunlop tires were pretty worn out when I replaced them on my M109R.
4,Used Product not like the picture,"This used unit came WITHOUT the chuck key NOR the depth rod NOR the side handle...:(A couple of bucks later I had a new chuck key, etal...That said...it has operated flawlessly since I have received it...:)"
1,It Stinks,"This is the dumbest book I have read on Witchcraft so far. There is nothing in it about the spiritual aspects; all it talks about is how to dress for success at the office, how to impress your boss by wearing clothes you can't really afford, and how several of their anonymous ""students"" bought pig farms or invested in stocks because their spirit guides told them to. I know this book has been ""updated for the new millenium;"" this basically amounts to an introduction that tries to tie this old style mumbo jumbo stuff into the current pagan revival.I do think it deserves one star because it does have some historical value -- the ""non-millenium"" version was written 30 years ago so it shows you how far the Craft has come and how not all forms of witchcraft were intelligent and spiritual. Also, I appreciate some of their advice about how to have a positive mental attitude and achieve material success. But mainly this book is idiotic. Don't waste your time, unless you're a Craft historian."
2,Not the best beginner book,"The Frosts' original book was the impetus for many people who became Witches in past decades. As such, it is of interest to students of the growth of Wicca and Paganism.However, its reliance on hard-to-find ingredients such as ""raw linseed oil"" is off-putting to today's beginner, who has many more options in finding a starter Witchcraft book. (Lilith McClelland's ""Spell Craft"" and Scott Cunningham's ""Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner"" come to mind.)In addition, at least one ritual calls for burning sulfur, which is highly dangerous indoors."
5,Can You Count to 14?,"David Hooper's book is very insightful and inspiring for anyone pursuing any career especially in music. He outlines with simplicity, the things aspiring music professionals must have to survive and thrive in this business of music. He emphasizes the need for focus and steering clear of forces that will easily derail a career such as friends and family that speak negatively about your vision. But first and for most he suggest the biggest enemy to your career is you. A must read. If you want to become a grounded and successful music professional, get 14 Qualities of Successful Musicians, Songwriters, and Music Business Professionals."
4,straight ahead practical advice,"The fourteen qualities David Hooper identifies as being important for music business professionals range from taking risks and working efficiently to giving back and expressing gratitude. Not new stuff, certainly, but his presentation is succinct, well organized and music industry targeted. Though it'll be most useful for beginners it's not just for them: as a music industry professional with more than a decade of experience, even though I didn't completely agree with the way he presented all all of his points, I found many of them useful jumpstarts to my own thinking."
5,Normal Girl,"I have known Geralyn her whole life and while she may be the ""It"" girl now, it is b/c she has suffered a heartwrenching disease at a young age. I was with her throughout her ordeal and she cartainly wan't an ""It"" girl when she was throwing up in cabs, walking around with no hair, feeling alone and fearful where her life was headed. She has done amazing things for young women with cancer and this book is another part of that effort. She is honest and open and approaches a topic that many shy away from with candor and humor. The fact that she may be an ""It"" girl now is a tribute to her perseverence and positive attitude."
4,Very New York!,"Once I remembered where I was emotionally at 27, I could then get into this woman's ballsy approach to facing breast cancer. I used to live in NY, which adds to her in-your-face view of the world. I loved the story about the taxi driver! I loved the tattoo! I love how she eventually overcame it all even though it was not a pretty journey. How honest.I devoured the book in two days. Anyone facing breast cancer will benefit from Geralyn's book. It gives me strength."
1,Why I Wore Lipstick,I have been struggling to get through this book. It is very sad that Ms. Lucas had breast cancer at an early age but I found her book to be superficial and egocentric. I hope she achieves a higher level of maturity as her journey progresses.
3,Shallowly strange,"Certainly intriguing for a cover album, the constant creative liberties taken may be in the spirit of Mingus's triumphant diversity and eccentric compositions but feels flimsily pretentious too often to render a convincing homage of the brilliantly unique artist."
3,Kind of boring,"I know that this review is basically going against most of the reviews on this site. But, I use to love Frey's work. In the last few books however, he seems to have shifted his writing from Financial Thriller to boring.I just could not seem to get involved in this book. Frey has brought back the main character from The Chairman - Christian Gillette. I had a hard time enjoying the Chairman and The Protégé is just not that thrilling for me.It felt as though the writing dragged on and on (always a sign that I hate the book). I still do not like the character of Gillette in the least and for some reason, lately Frey's books always feel as though most of the action happens in one location.It took everything I had to finish this book. Maybe its me - time to move on to other authors.I have been saying for a long time that the longer established authors (some of them) have been ""calling in"" their work recently and I think this is a good example. Definitely time to discover some new blood."
5,Strongly recommended to anyone planning to visit any part of this remarkable country either for business or for pleasure,"This expanded and updated eleventh edition of India is the result of considerable research and study by Lonely Planet's expert staff including Sarina Singh and ten associates. India is an comprehensive and highly portable 1140-page paperback guide to the diverse country of India.

India from Lonely Planet is very strongly recommended to anyone planning to visit any part of this remarkable country either for business or for pleasure."
3,Doesn't really grab you.,"I won't lie to you. ""The Mote in Gods Eye"" is very well written and thought through. It deals with the first contact between human beings and an alien intelligence. The authors were very thorough in presenting the physical and psychological barriers that may come about with alien contact. Despite the hard work, the book just isn't that exciting."
2,Kindle typos and errors.,Book is great but the kindle version is riddled with spelling and grammar errors. i guess no one did a spell check or a review before publishing it for the public to download. =/still a very good book and one of my favorites!
3,"Disappointing, but I had very high expectations.","I had looked forward to reading ""The Mote in God's Eye"" for a long while, and finally got around to it. I had very high expectations, since it is considered a classic and has received lots of praise.For me, ""The Mote in God's Eye"" was a big disappointment. I found the characters rather flat and not realistic. They almost seemed cartoonish, with the ""big Russian"" and the ""Scotsman"" with is broken English, and the only female on a star ship, ect.......The Moties are a sort of interesting alien culture, but nothing spectacular.I found many plot holes which seemed to distract greatly from the flow of the novel. As I read, I liked the novel less and less, and it took a lot of effort to finish it.For me, ""The Mote in God's Eye"" does not live up to the billing it has received."
5,A very interesting Mote!,Started a bit slow but keep reading. It really gets good. Some very interesting ideas. Startrek and beyond. It is worth the purchase. Once I got past the 1st 50 pages or so things really picked up.
3,I know it is a classic...,"Just a bit dry to me but that was the style of the time, still a good read and certainly a very different style of reading than modern sci-fi/fantasy"
5,Science Fiction at it's best!,"The Mote in God's Eye is a classic. This is the story of man's first encounter with intelligent alien life while dealing with domestic crises. Special interest groups vie with each other and the aliens over how to manage the situation, with potential disaster just beyond the horizen. A book you could easily get lost in, every time you read it."
1,Huge disappointment,"I recently bought this book solely because of the rave reviews it received, and was taken aback at just how bad it is. Packed full of clichéd characters (reading Dr. Horvath's dialogue made me cringe, no scientist is THAT naive and stupid). The moties themselves are a bit meh as well, I was expecting to be blown away by the revelations about their social structure (as one reviewer assured me I would be). I was not.I enjoyed Niven's Ringworld much more, as at least the Ringworld itself was hugely impressive when described in the book. None of the elements here impressed me at all. I will not be recommending this book to anybody, and am contributing this review in the hope that I save someone's time."
2,"Too much filler, hokey romance, and all that glorious, noble navy garbage made this one to return for a refund.","Some reviewers say this starts slow. I would add it stays slow ~ all the way to the end. The only exciting scenes leave the main characters out. Too obviously setting up sequels and not enough meat here to bother with.And what is it with the choppy POV switching every paragraph? This is strictly amateur writing. The humans are all walking cliches spouting officious nonsense.Okay, now I know what bestselling SF is like, I'll return to reading the classics. Had enough filler? Want to try the real thing? Try Schmitz, Scheckley, Triptree and Vance."
5,"The Second Best First Contact Novel, Ever","I'd rank this book right up with-but-after James Clavell's Shogun as the best First Contact novel we've ever had -- and Clavell had the advantage of being able to research the details that brought his Japan alive.Whether or not you agree with the politics that inform the novel -- that noblesse oblige really can work, most of the time -- you're liable to find it seductive in the way that the best of Heinlein was.With the exception of one line about Ensign Whitbread, I can't think of a thing I'd change. Terrific, terrific book."
4,Good SF,I will have to think about it some more but I couldn't put it down. It might be the best SF book I have read. Certainly it is one of the best and survived 40 years better than most survive 10.
3,A mixed bag,"Lansdale is one of my favorite authors, but this is one of my least favorite of his books. It reads like a rewrite of an unrelated novel as a Batman tale. When the story works, it often works as a piece of twisted and absurd horror, without the Batman. When it works as a Batman tale, it is in the relationship between Bruce and Alfred, and in seeing others' perceptions of the Bat. But those threads of the novel seldom connect, and the final conflict seems a bit forced. Overall, this wasn't so much a bad book as one that didn't seem to hit its stride or become fully finished."
4,The MacGregors saga,"If I know the MacGregors in real life, I'd probably hate their guts. Beautiful, successful, charismatic, a 100% success track record, and money to put Bill Gates to shame. Oh well, but they are fun to read nonetheless.I'm initiated to the MacGregors when I first read ""The MacGregor Brides"". Hence I've waited for Daniel's story to be reissued. My verdict? It's enjoyable, but it definitely shows its age. Daniel is the quissential chauvinistic arrogant hero so ubiquitous in the romances of the 80s. It's enjoyable, but not a keeper.""In From The Cold"" is slightly better, but it's too short to really make an impact.It is telling that despite its age, I enjoy ""For Now, Forever"" much more than the 1999 MacGregor book ""The Perfect Neighbour""."
5,Close to Perfect,This is one of Nora Roberts' best series. The characters are never one dimensional. and best of all we get more of The MacGregor.
5,Excellent Travel Rod,"I live in Hawai'i but went to Northern California to visit family, and fish the shoreline waters. My telescoping rod broke the first day so picked up this 4 piece Ugly Stick at a local fishing supply. Anyone who fishes regularly knows Ugly Sticks are super tough almost indestructible with a decent action, and a great value with an awesome warranty. This rod held up very nicely fishing the piers and jetties of Northern Cali. It packed up very nicely for my flight home, and now it's my truck rod always at the ready for impromptu fishing adventures. I highly recommend any Ugly Stick but especially this one if you want an almost bullet proof backpacking/travel rod. Buy one right now! ;)"
3,Ok except for poor joints,"The main problem with this rod is with the joint. They are not ground in for a close taper fit. The two wide joints on my example were wobbly and in danger of flying apart during a cast. I solved this problem by bedding in the joint with 600 grade valve grinding compound and beefing up the male end of one joint with a thin layer of epoxy, then gently grinding it in. Also the last tip end joint was not dead straight. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Waste of trees! Better to buy Hands On Training by Green,"I could not believe how useless this book was quite contrary to the title which mislead my buying its unhelpful, poorly written chapters covering things which were mostly intuitive or too simple for the complexities of server side site management. Every single question I had about Dreamweaver was left unanswered after its 1041 pages.Stay away from this book."
4,Great Product,These are fun for kids to play with & seem educational as well. The product would earn 5 stars if it werent made in Communist China!
1,DEAD LCD SCREEN !!! I'm not alone with,"well,one good thing about amazon reviewsis that you find out the product has a widespread technical flaw.it worked fine for about six months...then LCD screen went deadwhich, of course, kills doing anything more complicated thanprinting word documents and maybe a picture or twoif there are so many people with this problem, EPSON, should recall the productcan't wait to deal with customer service, EITHER!!!don't buy it"
3,RE:Yet another LCD screen failure...Class Action Suit anyone????,"I had the same problem with my printer. The LCD screen went out twice, the second time was just weeks out of warranty.I called customer support and complained. I even told them about all the people I read about in on line forums having the same problem. They agreed to send me a replacement. Now I keep the printer off until I need it...saving the screen from being on 24/7. I hope that will make it last longer!"
2,Was a great printer until the LCD died.,"I raved about this great printer for awhile. Woke up this morning and for no reason the LCD screen is gone, zap, zowie, outta here. I would only buy this printer if you think you will be able to live without the LCD later down the road."
1,LCD Stopped Working,"I was very happy with this printer until the LCD stopped working. Of course, it failed after it was out of warranty (18 months) and Epson customer service has been no help whatsoever. This is my first and last Epson product!"
1,Epson junk Dead LCD screen,Just in case someone is still selling this RX600 somewhere don't waste your money on it! Mine has been in a landfill for 5 years now. As other owners reported the LCD screen quits working in a year or less. I have never purchased another Epson product since. Instead I have migrated to Canon and have been very pleased with their products.
3,Epson Stylus Photo RX500 Inkjet All-in-One,"I ordered the Epson Stylus Photo ""RX500"" Inkjet All-in-One (last year's model) from Amazon. I got a free shipping, and the RX500 prints pictures and text very well. It also does a great job in re-creating pictures from negatives. However, Epson offered three great Rebates, so I sent them to Epson immediately, but Epson CLAIMS THEY NEVER RECEIVED THEM, and Espon discounted the phone number to ask them about the missing Rebates. I e-mailed Epson, but I got NO Reponse. Buy a Epson if you want a good printer, but DON'T expect the rebates if Epson is the one offering them."
3,Excellent.,"This set of dark tales about a grim ""detective"" solving crimes in a bleak oppressive future is truly Drake's best work.Lacey is a humorless, merciless ""rehabilitated"" rapist turned investigator who uses the all-seeing surveillance systems of the future to stalk his prey. Along the way he also gains some small measure of revenge against ""Big Brother"" for the mental emasculation that constituted his rehabilitation. It's too bad that none of Drake's other works come close to matching this level of intensity. Everything else I've read by Drake seems tepid and lame by comparison. Read it. Only 3 stars 'cause there are some really weak non-Lacey stories included to fluff up the word count."
2,A Rehash Of The Known,"The author does hit on many of the common arguments both for and against gun control issues and attempts to clarify both sides positions but in doing so he fails to answer the title question of the book. In contrast to the closing statement in the book description; ""Casting aside ideology and abstractions, he cautions against the belief that there exists some gun control solution which, had we the political will to seize it, would substantially reduce violent crime."", the author suggests that several gun-controls be enacted while acknowledging that there is little if any evidence that the controls would have any effect at all.The book is a good indtoduction to the debate for someone with little or no understanding of the major points but the closing recommendations appear unfounded."
1,Not Durable,"This is a great idea, however there is a durability issue. I've had to return three defective units. If Senco could get this problem fixed, I'd buy the updated version."
5,Very impressed!,"I was a little hesitant to purchase this online because it's really difficult to determine the quality from a few snapshots. Because of the great reviews on here, I decided to take a chance and order one for my fiance for Christmas. I was happy to find that the watch is beautiful and IMO looks much more expensive than it is. Bulova is known for being a great quality watch, my fiance loved it and was very impressed. If you're thinking of ordering, go right ahead - you won't be disappointed."
1,This song is sappy!,...I'm so glad I listened to this before buying. This is the sappiest song I have ever heard. There is no way I'm playing this at my wedding. There are MUCH better songs out there for your groom and his mom!
4,A Song for My Son,"I had not heard an appropriate, moving song to express a mother's feelings on her son's wedding day. This is a very nice song, indeed."
2,Kinda corny,I ended up not even using this song for my son's wedding. It was very sappy and didn't impress me.
3,A teaser,Intersting book but ultimately it is a setup for the next book. Many unanswered questions and little development occurs. The aleins are alnernatively omnipresent and then miss the point. Not sure where it is going but the book does not finish the story
2,strange read,I guess it was disturbing to me. The whole human/alien sex fests going on made it hard for me to read. I'll be stopping on the first one in this trilogy.
1,Don't judge a book by it's cover....but this is clearly an exception.,"Whatever the point of this album is, it's a travesty.Queen on American Idol? Good lord, even the Rolling Stones wouldn't stoop to such low levels."
3,strictly by the movie,"Don't get me wrong by the 3 star review, it wasn't a bad book or anything and Skipp and Spector are awesome authors, but i think they should have stuck more to their own fiction then doing a tie-in. Pretty much the same as the film, but it's a quick read and it passed the time."
5,designing the web,"It's really great to get a closer approach on the who's who in designing the web. This book reaches everyone who's interested in web as a visual medium. The ""Design Agencies.Com"" gives you an entire view on the process of creating web sites as the agencies exposes their feelings through comments and works. As a Web Designer it feeds me with the inspiration I need to keep on creating stuff for the Web, and I hope you all capture the same feeling I have about it."
1,Same problems as others,I thought the controller looked great and felt nice in the hands until my left joystick broke as well after a few days use. I have never broken a controller before and I have over 50 from different systems. Very cheaply made.
1,Not worth the hassle,"GOOD: I picked this controller up because it looked like it would be perfect for people with larger hands. Well, it does fit well in the hands but that's the only thing good about it.Bad: The buttons are too close together so you sometimes hit 2 at a time. Then when you need to press Y & B together, it frequently doesn't work or you end up pressing the black(clear) or white button accidentally because they are (1)placed in the old area on top vs. the bottom and (2) they are too close to the other buttons. When I took a punch from a fighter, it began to vibrate but wouldn't stop for about 20 seconds (stuck). The buttons are also too close to the right stick. I kept bumping it while pressing B or X. I used this controller for about 1 hour on Tao Feng and 1/2 hour on Matrix, then I chucked it in the trash.Good luck."
3,they're no Scissor Girls,"This is okay, pretty good. I'd go so far as to say it's not bad. But for christ sakes music listeners, go back to the source and listen to the Scissor Girls! Start with ""We People Space With Phantoms"" and work your way through their other mazes. THEN come back and listen to this. Having said that, I should also say that I think Erase Errata is a very good band and you should try to see them live -- how about that drummer, eh? Still, they're no Scissor Girls."
1,...,I have been through three of these nail guns. All there stop working after 3-5 clips of nails (2 1/2 inch Senco nails in to soft pine). First the motor would short cycle then the guns would start smoking. The gun did counter sing the nails pretty good when it worked.
1,Good tool - poor engineering,I bourght this tool from my local dealer in the UK. As we pay a lot more for the tools (rougly $680 USD) in england i was expecting great things - how wrong was i!!i used it for about six months then the driving blade wouldn't return into the cylinder so i had to keep pushing it in manualy. i returned the tool and Senco UK who gave me a full refund with not even the option of replacing the tool - i don't know if they are taking them of th marketin the UK but i now run with the DeWalt - what a tool - i know it is a brad nailer but that is the norm hear as most people who do trim use the paslode.dont waste your money - get the DeWalt!
1,TOOO NARROW,"From the pic, u think this is metaal but its not. Infact it is plastic. A fairly thick plastic. Too narrow to fit through the door."
3,nice quality but,"This is a nice, heavy duty looking product. However, I need to use it on either the side door of my garage or the door between the garage and house, where my washer and dryer are, and it is too shallow. It would be nice if the description noted that it is made for interior doors only."
1,Find a different manufacturer,"I'm returning this product, for a few reasons: the pressure gauge isn't accurate, the hose from the compressor to the tire isn't long enough, and the unit looks like it will fall apart after one season of use. The idea is great, but the delivery is poor."
3,Wagan 2014 Quick Flow 3-in-1 Air Compressor,"quit good product fot its price. it dilivered on time.adv:1) small, easy to put it in car. it does not need a lot of space.2) good functionsdisadv:1) presure is not very strong so it needs much time."
1,Died after one use R.I.P.,"Nice looking design, but just can't do the job. Worked for less than 10 minutes. No manufacturing info. And the cheap price makes it not worthwhile to mail back for replacement."
1,be careful,"I recently bought a different model of wagan air compressor (the 2050). When I tried to plug it in, the compressor would not operate when turned on. After testing it in couple of different cars, I gave up.I then plugged my cell phone back in and found that my 12V socket was no longer working. After some investigation, I found that the compressor blew the cig-lighter fuses in all 3 cars I had tried it in.Quality may be lax with these products, so beware."
3,Disappointed,"Maybe I got way too excited when I heard the BOTP videos were being released. But sad to say, I felt that Vol 1 & 2 were not as good as I remembered them to be (when I was a kid). Actually, I was bored.I think the artwork is awesome and the music still rocks. But the storytelling needed work. Maybe the DVD works better than the video.Warning: The video only has the American versions."
3,Good for a laugh if you like this sort of thing.,"Denis Boyles developed his writing style at National Lampoon, which about says it all. So this is more of the same and if you liked National Lampoon you will probably enjoy this. Boyles specializes in slick, sophisticated prose, claims to take the moral high ground, while neatly side-stepping any real responsibility for his viewpoints. He seems to be the kind of guy who makes smart remarks, then smirks as his companions fight over the controversy... Sort of a more intelligent and noble appearing Rush Limbaugh."
1,NOT the collection to buy,"Considering that you can get volumes 1 - 6 for about the same price then I'd say that this is most definitely NOT the collection to get. This set only includes volumes 2,3 and 4 which significantly include NO HOLIDAY episodes! Save your money and get the volume 1 - 6 pack for about two dollars more."
2,Not feeling the love.,"""I'll take care of you. All you have to do is be waiting for me with open arms when I come in the from the woods at the of a hardworking day."" Fancy is forced to work in a dance hall after the death of her father, in order to take care of her family. From the first time Chance meets Fancy he treats her like a whore, even after he realizes she is innocent. I made it half way through this book and there is no love. At this point I could never love Chance, and can not imagine how Fancy could either. I gave this book 2 stars only because I gave up half way to the end."
3,Oxford take Off in Russian,While the content is excellent. The binding of the book is very bad and has began to come apart already after approx 4 uses.
2,Fairly awful game,"This game is a mess (though it was made many moons ago). The graphics are okay (but you can't see a lot of the smaller enemies), the weapon system is good, the scale of battles is good, however...everything is poorly implemented especially the control scheme.Control is too touchy, battles are too hectic and too fixed (objective-wise), story is goofy, and the game is extremely repetitive. Even with a six pack in front of you you're going to be bored out of your skull. It is a very cheap game at retail, though in this case you're going to get what you pay for."
3,A ROUGH LIFE,"I was expecting a great read from this book, but was disappointed as the author did not talk enough about his personal experiences and went into histories of dams, histories of places, and got somewhat techinical about a few of his subjects. He did a great job on researching for his story. I was enjoying the book a lot until a little over half way through when I would say the subject matter became spotty as to my interest. The life of a forest ranger is not easy and a most interesting part in the book is talking about dust and it ramifications. This book is not a dud, but just didn't meet my expectations."
2,Read The Last Season by Eric Blehm instead,"Perhaps it's because I had just finished The Last Season, another, much superior, book by a park ranger that I found this book so lacking. The subject has much promise but the execution is excruciating. There are a few good parts but the choppy storytelling and unrelated tangents left me unsatisfied. After the rendering of one incident regarding a missing woman, I actually wished I had never picked up this book."
3,"Where is Little Rock, Texas???","I am using this book to study for the K-6 PLT. I hope this book helps me as much as other reviewers. I have yet to take the test. The practice is good for me. HOWEVER... some of the information is inconsistent with theories I have learned about in other places. The writing is very poor, and not at all what I would expect of a Ph.D. The editor was sleeping when he allowed one Question Explanation to state, ""The Little Rock 9 was comprised of nine Black students from Little Rock, Texas,"" - it's ARKANSAS! -NOT TEXAS!"
3,Good Outline,"This is a good base to start studying for the PLT. It needs more details of the content. If you use this, you should also have other sources of study."
4,5 or 7 blade?,"This is a great mower. The Pacific Nortwest lawns may benefit more from the 5 blade vs the 7. When I ordered I assumed that the 7 blade would be more effective. It does fine, but some taller grass I have do do twice in opposite direction. The Sunlawn company does say that the seven blade is good for all No. Amer. grass.I am faster with this than when I used my power mower. It is also great to leave the clipings on the ground. My grass looked better in two weeks.I have a 4,000 sq ft lawn and I can more in two diecrtions faster then one with my power mower."
1,Poor Customer Service & Not So Good Product!!,"I can't mow with it, or get assistance from Sunlawn! The blades seem to be milled improperly on the ends. This keeps me from adjusting the blade to the correct spacing per the owner's manual. Which in turn allows the grass to pull right through without being cut! I purchased this mower on May 15th. I finally received a reply on June 21st after many emails and phone calls. I was to expect a return label for the mower. It is now July 29th. No label. And, no response from Sunlawn. I've been using a reel mower for many years now. I heard so many good things about Sunlawn mowers; I had to try it. Too bad I got a lemon. I hope to get this remedied before the onset of winter. --Upadate-- Finally got the mower back to Sunlawn, but have yet to get my money back after one month and two emails."
4,This Girl IS A BRAVE ONE!,"This is a book with its feet in the earth and it's soul in the clouds. The eyes of the book are directly connected to the sun!As a woman from Northern Sudan, I cannot pretend that I don't find the author Kola Boof deeply disturbing and even scary, because she has expressed so much disdain for Muslims and Arabs. But I cannot deny the power of her writing or the passion of her beliefs. I was literally swept away by them and hated when the book ended. I look forward to her next one and I pray that she will come to love her father's people, us the Arab Islamics. Keep up the good work Kola."
2,close but no cigar,"It's unfortunate that this, the only full-length Catwoman novel I know of, had to take place so shortly after the dismal Frank Miller Year One reboot. This Catwoman is a far cry from the smart, sexy, classy villainess-hero so many Cat-fans (not to mention Bat-fans) fell for."
1,This is the worst miso soup I've ever had,"This miso soup is bland and flavorless, no seaweed, microscopic flakes of tofu that somehow manage to stay hard as a rock. The people who make this should be embarrassed, even the worst restaurant I've ever been to has better miso soup than this."
3,"Good flavor, small packets","Each packet makes about 3/4 cup of soup, which is smaller than I expected. The miso itself is white, rather than the brown shown on the packaging. The miso has a decent flavor, though. I'm more disappointed with the other elements of the soup, such as the tofu and seaweed. The soup doesn't contain very many of these extras, and the items that are there are chopped into pieces that are too tiny to really taste."
3,It isn't necessarily what you think...,"Okay I picked up this book thinking that it was an erotic book on a taboo subject. It's just S/M in a role-playing set up. Did I think it would be incestuous fiction? Yes I did (I'll admit it). Unfortunately I didn't get that. So if that's what you're thining this book is and why you're buying it, keep on moving... unless you like big sweaty men disciplining and doing othe rbig sweaty men while being called 'Daddy'. There were a few heterosexual stories in there which were hot, but they were exception not the rule. So if you enjoy gay fiction, pick this up. If I had known I would have skipped it cuz that's not my thing. (no offense to those who like it, it's just that I don't)"
3,"sexy fantasy, uneven treatment","the Daddy/boy or Daddy/girl fantasies are hot, scary, and still extremely taboo. that's probably one of the things i like so much about them, and i think having a book of erotica strictly about this fantasy is a wonderful idea. unfortunately, not all of the stories in this collection gripped me as much as i'd hoped they would. the best one, in my opinion, was a two-part story called ""The Leatherdaddy and the Femme,"" which tackled role reversals, gender play, and hot sex all at once. many of the other stories didn't stand out as much, to my mind, and one or two of them seemed to push the line of where consent gets withdrawn, which made me a little uncomfortable... of course, this is why it's so good that amazon.com gives discounts on everything; this book may not have been worth $10 or $11, but for $8, it's worth having."
5,it just made me die laughing!,"When I first saw this book I did a double take. A bird that skis? And the names! this book is pure humor. I've been looking everywhere for the other book and cant find it anymore in stores. I liked it a ton and I think you will, too."
4,"Cute, Short & Quick","Cute, Short, Quick. Notice that all the words that come immediately to mind to describe this book don't take much time. The same is true for the activities suggested in this book--how long does it really take to give someone a hug or say hello to a stranger on the street? Yet all these activities are things that encourage a sense of connectedness and a renewal of a tired spirit. The illustrations have a childlike charm and simplicity. In a culture that seems more and more designed to demand and isolate it's nice to find a book that celebrates simpler values."
1,Lack of a game walk-thru = why bother to write the book,The maps and descriptions were in sepearte chapters. The Weapon stats were incomplete. The Monster stats were incomplete. The lack of any help on the master quest or any of the subquests questions why even write the book. Very disappointed. Next time surf the web for better information.
3,OK book,"The book was OK, however their was a ton of old articles, that were not very helpful. Had a few good articles though so if you can get it cheap it might be worth the purchase."
2,Una vez mas Molotov no lo ha logrado,"Molotov es en mi opinion el mejor grupo de rock mexicano, pero su creatividad ha disminuido mucho desde Apocalipsh*t. Ahora en este album de covers que podria ser como una secuela de Dance And Dense Denso como lo fue Apoclipsh*t de Donde Jugaran las Niñas? el cual ha sido el mejor album de Molotov, con un sonido crudo, unas letras insanas y satiricas.Recapitulando Con Todo Respeto carece de aquellas letras explosivas que Molotov sabe hacer y no hemos visto en un largo tiempo ya que Dance And Dense Denso tuvo las mismas carencias musicales. Se puede decir que su musica ha evolucionado, pero no para bien. Los canciones que podrian sobresalir de este album serian: Amateur, La Revo, Perro Negro Granjero y tal vez Mamar, lo demas es solo relleno o canciones muy estupidas como DA DA DA.Este es solo mi opinion, al comprar el album tu lo decidiras. Si tienes dudas o comentarios sientete libre de ponerte en contacto conmigo en drio1@slipknot.be"
5,Perfection,I want to comment at what perfect time I received this product. The packaging was perfect. And the product did the job right.
1,Not the original versions!,"If you want to read Emily Dickinson's poetry in their original form and you want to discover the incredible vitality of this poet's intellect, imagination, and artistic skill, don't buy this book. The poems in this collection are ""improved"" versions of the original poems which can be found in other available editions. Moreover, the selections include most of ED's least interesting work. When ED died two people selected some of her poems and prepared them for publication by adding punctuation, altering words, and even omitting words, lines, and whole stanzas so that the polite readers of her day would find ED's poems more palatable and less offensive."
4,an american treasure,"Growing up in Amhearst, Massachusetts, Emily Dickinson's life appeared quite uneventful to all those around her. This collection proves however, that Miss Dickinson's inner thoughts and dreams were anything but uneventful. Subtly chronicalling her evolution from wistful girl to probing woman, ""Collected Poems"" allows its reader to journey side by side with Miss Dickinson in her philisophical and religious journey."
5,Bluesy Gospel and Perfect Slide Guitar,"While a religious person like Willie Johnson would not have liked to be compared with blues artists, I have to say that few artists bring the BLUES across like he does. The songs are gospel throughout, but coupled with a great feel for rhythm and probably the best slide guitar work ever, they still belong to blues for me.The quality is surprisingly good most of the time (thanks to digital remastering), wich makes Johnson's playing even more compelling, his voice even more powerful.If you're not convinced yet, listen to ""Dark was the Night"", fight back the tears, and buy this record."
2,Good but not real good,"Grew up outside Buffalo, New York. Listened to Joey every night and watched his Saturday dance show on tv. Book was easy read but a disappointment. No dates and not enough information....it seemed to jump around. (maybe like his life) I though would not have missed this book...brought back good memories."
5,love it,"I really like this cd it is the first one ,i ever own by this artist.I first learned of Crystal thru Kirk Franklin and Trin-i-tee 5:7.Her voice is pretty.My favorite songs on here are:Reach Out-it's slow sort of rock-n-roll edge,but i like it.Trust Me-melody beat like with beautiful lyrics.Only Fools-song is just beautiful to me,got to understand words of the song.Fearless-fearless means a lot to me, because it means going without fear.One Man-powerful christian rock-n-roll edge.Change My Heart-reminds me of a Mariah Carey song.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK CRYSTAL."
5,here we go again,Crystal Lewis is awsome. I love this album. One man should be a classic. I will go should be a call on all of our lives to live for Crist at any cost. Buy this album.
2,I was disappointed...,"I was really going into buying this album thinking it would be the best she has ever done. It doesn't touch ""Beauty For Ashes"" and ""Gold"". I thought that the songs all sounded the same. There were a few songs that are good: ""One Man"", ""Only Fools"", ""Satisfied"", and ""Trust Me"" are the only ones that stood out and they are, in my opinion, the only good songs on this album. I love the vocals, they have a 8. The words have a 7, but the arrangement of the songs has a 1. Crystal, I liked this album, I guess, but the way everyone was talking....it was gonna be a smash hit...and it is anything but that! :-)"
3,Needs better focus and organization,"There is some interesting stuff in this book, but if you are trying to plan a trip, and want to look something up, well, it can be a challenge to find the information you want.Part of the problem is that this book if full of weird stuff.For example, there are two pages on nursing homes in the area.The section on antique stores in the area around the National Park is several times as long as the section on hiking trails in Glacier National Park.And the section on hiking trails in Glacier National Park is not in the section on Glacier National Park.Much of the text is devoid of content, so that I did not enjoy the time spent browsing through this book to find the information we needed."
1,BAD! BAD! BAD!,"I got these shoes from some other website, not amazon.Let's say, they are super uncomfortable!I decided to return them after wearing for 10 minuts...BAD! BAD! BAD!"
2,Cure for insomnia!,"This dvd is basically, as described in part of the description, a video tour. Nothing related to Da vinci's code is talked about in depth, as the narrator is constantly saying ""without revealing too much"" and will continue to talk about the building or city. Although there were a couple of interesting facts, I was very disappointed because it's very boring and the back round music put me to sleep twice, that's saying alot for me.To add to your collection for the few bucks it is - I say go ahead."
4,"One of two ""must own"" resources if you plan to take the CISSP exam","This book, and Shon Harris 3rd Edition (I also read Krutz) are must-have resources for CISSP exam preparation. If you can digest the whole thing, they may be the only books you need, though real life experience is a prerequisite as well. This ISC2 ""Official Guide is pretty dry, I'm not going to lie, but it's critical that you work your way through it if you want that coveted ""Congratulations"" e-Mail from ISC2. I recently climbed the mountain successfully (first try even!) and this book was a key in my success. Spend the money, bite the bullet and dive in. Good luck!"
5,Really Useful Reference,"I just received notice from (ISC)2 that I passed the CISSP exam. I am gratified that I had read this Official Guide and would like to recommend it to those going to write the exam.I had read other books on CISSP but found that the exam question style and content resemble that of the Guide most.The first read was difficult since the writing style, as pointed out by other reviewers, was indeed dull. You would however find the material useful on further readings.My advice to prospective exam takers is to use this Guide as the ultimate resource but you do need to read other books to cover the depth and breadth required of the exam."
3,"Not perfect, but the best of the CISSP books ...","Finally made this purchase after digging through the morass of useless, incomplete fluff that infests the tech sections of bookstores these days. Despite its shortcomings, I promptly rid myself of every other book on the subject and spent the refund money on beer.There are a few meaningless redundancies and some downright vague and poorly-worded descriptions, but overall this is the only CISSP study guide that is thorough, concise, and largely adequate to the task of preparing students for The Real Thing. It also makes a great reference tool for later use on the job; if it doesn't have the raw data you're looking for, it most certainly has a few citations for which you can google.Practice Test Caveat: When scoring your practice tests after each chapter, carefully read the answer descriptions and check the answer letter consistency; several times you will get the answer right when the book at first says you're wrong."
3,"Not the best, but worth the money","This book was OK, but not great. It had a number of `bugs' that should be worked out by the time a second edition is released.Examples of bugs in the text:Minor things like:P844 - Answer for sample test question 24, when there wasn't a question 24Typos P659 - Two option C's to this question, p663 ""BPC"" instead of BCPMajor things like:P806 - Wrong answer on rootkits. The definition conflicts with common knowledge found online @ Sans, searchsecurity, etc...P769 - Question 2 is asking for a reaction for an employee's ""malfeasance""... First I heard of that word, and I couldn't find it in the chapter or index or glossary. Malfeasance definitions I found online didn't really help me understand what this sample test question was trying to teach me.Overall I thought the book was helpful in my preparation for the CISSP exam (which I passed). Worth the money, but I'd focus my attention on All-In-One for cover to cover reading."
5,Great Raw Sound,Love his guitar playing - nice resonator sound. He has a unique sound. I really like Parchmen Blues. Great CD for a blues affaciando.
5,Bukka White the MAN,"I couldn't belive this was Bukka White the first time I listened to this cd . Because the first time I heard him was on ""Masters of the Delta Blues friends of Charlie Patton"" (a must cd 4 any 1 interested in getting involed in acoustic delta blues) the reason 4 this is I didnt really enjoy those Victor recordings of him I would always skip those songs (no offense Bukka) but when I heard the complete VOCALION recordings (ring a bell any 1) I was blown away I listned to the cd over and over I freakin love trk.2 Shake em On Down . Bukka is a down and dirty blues man he sounds nonthing like those religous Victor recordings on this cd . If your a fan of acoustic blues or blues period you will enjoy this cd very much."
3,The earache of heartbreak,"The nineteen songs on HEARTBREAK OF ROCK span the years 1975-1992. Various aspects of the complications that l'amour brings are covered, to the point that the listener wearies. Full-length versions of all songs are offered. This EMI compilation has excellent sound.TOTAL PLAYING TIME -- 73:19"
4,Made an good attempt at relating to teens of today.,"I had to read this book as part of a theology course(St.Ignatius H.S. Cleveland. It was a valuable tool to relating to the course I took. While I didn't agree with everything in the book, I admired the strength of Doc Pennock's beliefs and I fully reccommend this book to any school with a Morality course. The book also has great debate questions that can give a teacher or other students valuable insights on how others think."
3,"It is easy to use, but not very powerful.",I bought this to assist in taking photos of my Apt/Interior space.It did the job(just)
4,Becoming a Man,"Times are tough when 17-year-old Moss Trawnley loses his job. It's the Great Depression years, and work is hard to come by, so Moss packs up and leaves, searching for his shiftless father. He finds him, but his father is not a man who'll take up his family responsibilities. So it's up to Moss, and thankfully, a job with the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps)provides an income. But Moss gets more from his new government job than a regular paycheck to send back home. He learns about personal responsibility, and loyalty, honesty and humility. Moss' search for the man of the family turns out to be...Moss.Jeanette Ingold has captured the times and the voice of those Depression years of struggle in America, and particularly in Montana where the story takes place. Moss' story is a hard one, but there's hope for him when he signs up for a hitch with the CCC. I'm a big fan of historical fiction with action and truth in the telling. Ingold absolutely nails it."
4,A New Game- and a Beautiful Game,"The Beautiful Game is a breath of fresh air from Acoustic Alchemy. With the passing of Nick Webb we will never have ""PURE"" Acoustic Alchemy again. So having said that, one should understand comparing this new work with the old may not be wise. This effort from Greg Carmichael and the group does stand on its own two feet- a fine and balanced album. True it does seem somewhat ""mainstream"" and less ""acoustic"" yet I for one am VERY satisfied with the outcome of this recording. I look forward to many more."
5,Another must have for Acoustic Alchemy fans,This is the second CD I bought by Acoustic Alchemy and it's one my favorites of all of their CD's. Their music always puts me in a good mood and just plain makes me happy! I look forward to every new release!
4,Pretty good album.,"Took a while to get into it totally. Bought it at for the single ""Flex"", but the rest of the album is pretty good. Only album by him, so i dont have anything else to judge it from."
3,Handsome and Rugged Garden Nozzle,"It seemed I had to purchase new hose nozzles every year or two. The brands available at my local 'big box' stores stopped working far too soon.This nozzle promises to outlast the others. Comfortable in the hand, the only disappointment was that the spray pattern must be adjusted by screwing the tip in or out (vs. varying the hand-lever when squeezing the trigger).Having the trigger inside a 'trigger guard' also prevents the nozzle from accidentally spraying myself if the nozzle is dropped. (Readers will understand if it's ever happened to them.)"
4,"Great introduction, difficult recipes","The authors give an excellent argument in their introduction. In my case they are preaching to the converted; I have been using a low calorie diet for twenty years or so.I've never followed one of their recipes however. They are not too complicated but often mention ingredients that I've never heard of. In several recipes I've seen them using Spanish words instead of the English equivalents.The recipes are interesting, sometimes imaginative, but never inspiring."
2,Not That Good,"I am a true crime buff...and I found this book rather boring. I could have written the same book, as there was no ""inside info""...it seems like the author just gathered all the television news stories and put them inside the book"
5,I've started my life over!,I've been trying for years to let go of a devastating breakup of a long-term relationship. This book did it! I now feel completely free to start a new relationship without any of the old baggage. I can't say enough good things about this book. It has helped me let go of a hundred little problems as well.
1,Not That Good,The only song I liked off the soundtrack was The Royal Crown song the rest were kind of bland.
2,unfortunately as of June 99 the only book on this topic,"Obvious typos, including people's names in the acknowledgement.A substantial portion of the book is taken from individual submission Internet drafts, which have no Internet standards status and will typically either be taken up by a working group and evolve considerabily towards standardization, or be dropped."
1,La Magie Continue is not the one you want to buy.,"If you saw Quidam and Dralion don't buy La Magie Continue. It cost the same but believe me, it is so boring."
4,Good CD form !!!,"This cd shows off the quartets strong harmony. The slows songs still hold up, though the up-tempo is kinda that new jack sound. They came out at a time when real talent was'nt appreciated..Seriously, if you like En Vogue, you should get this and also try Ebony Vibe Everlasting."
3,Gardenia,The Paris Rain vacuum beads are pleasantly scented with a gardenia fragrance. The first time I used the beads I didn't notice any fragrance but the second time I did. It is not overly strong and will only mildly scent the room while you are vacuuming. I didn't find that the fragrance lasted so it seems to only make the experience of vacuuming more pleasant. To use the beads you just pour them into the vacuum bag or you can sprinkle them on the floor and suck them up with the hose. I have tried other products that promised similar results and find the Good Home beads to be the best.~The Rebecca Review
4,What's the deal? This is the REAL deal!,"I don't get it. I see all the raves for all of the other ""Vibes"" albums, and they [the other CDs] are weak in the light of the rich tapestry or roots reggae.THIS... This is there best album! It's original in its' genre, it's real and sincere, and it's fun. If you want an album that best captures this great band, this is it. In fact, the only other song of theirs that I would pursue would be the title track of ""Strength of My Life"" - An iconic devotional to Jah on the same order as Bob's ""Redemption Song"".Sure the Vibe's other albums have some okay stuff (they were always best live), but there are better places to spend your money. Get this one and move on."
4,Pleased with set,"Very nice set of student watercolors. Colors were very clear, and the array was quite nice. Would recommend to others."
2,Don't like these,"Hi, the reason I don't like these is they're a pain to use. I kept adding water to try to lift the paint off and no luck. I couldn't get enough pigment onto the brush no matter what I tried... I've gone back to my Windsor-Newton's and Holbein's. They are worth the extra money for rich colors and ease of use. I was disappointed in this product because it seemed a nice choice. Not."
4,Tooth review,I bought this cross-section tooth model for my child's science fair project. The tooth was smaller than we'd anticipated but we made it work. Just wish the tooth came with a stand for demonstration purposes.
1,Problems with Sound Blaster Audigy 2,"Looks like a great product...but $80 later, I'm stuck with a CD that does me no good because I own a Sound Blaster Audigy 2 soundcard. Evidently, ""newer"" drivers don't work with this product. You have to install drivers from...2003? Note that there are absolutely NO updates available for this product, and I'm writing this review as of August 21, 2005. If your SB drivers are from 2004 or newer, you will get a ""blue screen of death"" when trying to execute key commands in this application (such as ""new song...""). If you don't have a Sound Blaster sound card, then go for it, but otherwise.....good luck! Besides, Sound Blaster cards are pretty obscure......right?"
2,"Decent beats, but the intructions might as well have been in Chinese","I did some research looking for the simplest software for making some downtempo music. Every review I read said Kinetic was the one. I installed the software and read the instructions, and they were of little or no use. You must need a degree from Berkeley or Full Sail to understand the manual.I eventually was able to make a song through trial and error but they seriously need to get some better writers at Cakewalk to explain how the software works."
3,A Business in Risk : Risky.......,"As a book outlining concepts of business science this book is passable, but nothing more. The Jardine Matheson content is vast although some highly significant strategic moves, the investment in Trafalgar House and any analysis of the effect of the cross shareholding arrangement, are glaring omissions. As a business science book this was not good value, as a Jardines book the ""Thistle and the Jade"" totally outclasses Ms. Connell's efforts. Too much enthusiasm for the company comes over and as the book was not written with official sanction it is hard to understand why. The subject deserves a far more balanced critique than that given, better books on this subject exist!"
3,KVM switch not for USB keyboard,"Won't work with a USB keyboard and mouse, even if you have adapters. Seems like it would work fine if you had a PS/2 keyboard and mouse. The Audio sharing is a pluss, especially for the small price."
1,Poor PS/2 connection ports,"I've been having a terrible time with getting my PS/2 keyboard and mouse to stay plugged into the PS/2 ports on this switch. I've never had a problem pluging into any other PS/2 ports but my keyboard and mouse keep slipping out of the ports on this KVM switch and as a result I keep loosing all connectivity.I've even tried plugging an adapter into the ports to see if that would help, but nothing seems to stay into the ports without slipping out. I was looking to see if there was some way to reduce the size of the port opening but it does not look feasible. I even tried strapping my devices in place with rubber bands but the ports are just too slack.I've given up on this product."
1,Author is a complete hypocrite,"I had the unfortunate opportunity to meet this author and was shocked to find that she abused her own animals! She had an Iguana that she carelessly neglected to the point it starved to death. Then there was her dog who lived with her in Kansas; the dog was forced to always stay outside on their aprox. 3 acres of land that was covered in ticks and who wimpered day and night from the pain of the insects biting into its flesh. I even witnessed her sending her husband to murder a rattlesnake that was sunbathing in the children's sandbox (the kids were inside, the snake was not coiled up and nobody else was around) and she refused to heed my uggestions to call animal control to come and retrieve the animal and relocate it! She claims to be compassionate but the truth is she is cold as ice. DONT READ THIS BOOK!"
2,More than a little judgmental,"I thought this book had some good information in it, but was more than a little judgmental of those who don't choose to conform to one or more aspects of the author's lifestyle. She seems to take the attitude ""My way is the best way, and if you don't agree, then you are wrong and just haven't done your research."" I think if she toned down the whole ""holier than thou"" thing, this would be a much better book."
4,superb spikey folk rock,"throughout Epiphany In Brooklyn, Brenda Kahn's acoustic guitar strums along with a fiery drive that enforces her sharp songwriting skills. her songs are stories littered with colourful characters and broken bleeding hearts. the music is Dylan-esque in it's basic approach, but employs plenty of heart and soul to make it stand out as her own. this is a superb collection of songs with ""She's In Love"" probably being my all time favorite. Brenda has a skill for penning some great lyrics and she comes accross as a master storyteller with a sarcastic smirk that seems to cut both ways. i first bought this album on cassette after seeing her ""Eggs On Drugs"" video on some very small independent music video show years and years ago. eventually, i wore the tape out and was saddened to learn that this cd went out of print. thankfully, i got lucky when i found this in a used bin and i've been enjoying relistening back to these great songs full of love, life, wisdom and wit."
5,"It's sly, it's sultry, it's rough and it's pure rock","While it's rougher and in ways simpler (emotionally) than her previous records, this alternate side of Juliana Hatfield (compared to Beautiful Creature) is witty and sly. Hatfield has more sense of humour here than most rockers and isn't afraid of torn edges or shredded ears. Pare it down, and this album is still as melodic as Only Everything and Bed, only with a different format: a mission statement that includes ""a solo per song"" and superb continuity through ""limitations"" in the effects department. Get it now!"
2,Not the Best - Mon,"I found any plot disrupted by the author's silly use of the term ""mon"". I believe he used it to give us an insight into Jamaican culture :=). Sam Tucker's use of the words ""Boy"" and ""Son"" are also very amateurish."
1,Thank God he learned to write after this one!,"I was relieved to find out that this was Ludlum's first book and not a recent one. He has certainly come a long way since The Cry of the Halidon. If I had read this book first, I would probably never pick up another Ludlum book, and what a shame. He is one of the best suspense writers out there.There's no definition to any of the characters and no point to the story - whatever the story was. By the time you get to the end (at least it read fast), you could care less about any of them. I also found it amazing that if I put the book down for a few hours, I would have to go back and recap in order to remember what it was I was reading about. Thank God Ludlum learned to write after this one!"
2,Not what I expected,"A weak story line and a confusing plot ensured that I was complete lost somewhere in the middle of Jamica in the first few chapters.Was disappointing to read this work of Ludlum, who otherwise has had an untarnished reputation so far."
2,no special talent for music,"If Axiom of Choice have a great talent, it's for getting their music fairly widely known. But a lot of the music on this cd sounds like an absent-minded jam anyone could have in their garage with a friend. There's some richer music on this cd, a song or 2, but not really. For music like this, I recommend other people such as Vas, Rasa, Stellamara, & even Loreena McKennitt."
2,"Too smooth, too studied","This CD is to authentic world music what smooth jazz is to jazz. Somewhat palatable and skilled, while nearly devoid of soul and art.Redeemed from a wholly negative review by the beautiful ""Raindrops,"" which has everything the rest of the album lacks."
3,Just ignore the CD cover.,"The cover art for this CD imho is responsible for the lack-lustre performance of this great work in the sales department. It's way too grim and dark for someone who who is Lauper.Anyways in one of her songs - Hat Full of Stars - she sings something like - 'you never looked inside...'- this perhaps may have said something a lot about this album.The theme is indeed dark, the lyrics, what not...Great songs are as follows imo:1. Who let in the Rain2. Lies3. Sally's Pigeons4. Someone Like Me5. Hat full of Stars"
5,A must have for die hard fans,"Have always liked Cyndi but, it wasn't until seeing her in concert with Cher that I started buying music. I have almost everything she has ever recorded. Although Hat Full of Stars is not my favorite it is an excellent cd. It shows much of her talent in both her writting skills and her vocal range. It is a must have for die hard fans."
2,"Great on assembly, but less than three pages on Machine Quilting!","I would like to give this book two separate ratings. As a basic how-to-make-quilts book, it deserves perhaps four stars. It's got nice, clear instructions on the basics of how to assemble a variety of simple quilt blocks.However.As a book on ""New Techniques for Machine Quilting,"" as the subtitle says, it barely deserves one star. There are precisely 2.75 pages devoted to how to quit your quilt, and most of that is devoted to stiching in the ditch. That's it! There's talk about how this book will help you quilt sections of the quilt before it's assembled, but the info on that part is sketchy, wordy, confusing, and short (3.25 pages) - I really need some pictures or summaries to make sense of it better. I bought this book for help on the quilting, not the patchwork, so I'm a bit disappointed."
4,Love it,"I used this book to make my 1st quilt. I used blocks that I had already made and used the method in this book to finish the quilt. It was easy, of course I made mistakes, but it was the normal I am learning something new mistakes. I am very excited to try another quilt in this method. This time I will use on of the blocks in the book."
5,My favorite quilting book,I really like this book. Whether you are a machine or hand quilter the patterns are fun and challenging. I am just beginning to machine quilt and the stitch in a ditch patterns help alot. I still like hand quilting better though. Each time I look at this book I think of different color combinations I could use. If you're a quilter you know this could be dangerous.
4,The Flower Lover,"The Flower Lover is chock full of mystery, intrigue and suspense. As they say in the biz -- it's a page-turner! The main character, Richard Garcia, reminds me of Seattle Detective J.P. Beamont of the J.A. Jance novels and Spencer of the Robert B. Parker novels. He is sensitive and witty, and oh so MANLY! Hope this author starts cranking these out like Jance and Parker -- a series maybe?? I'd love to see more..."
4,Just another dumb review,"This album, although probably not their best, is definitely the most mature. Throughout mxpx's years together as a band they've definitely progressed musically. The song structure is slightly more complicated, the guitar riffs are far more frequent and often show off Tom's skills as a punk guitarist. If you are a die hard mxpx fan then you probably already have this album. If you are looking for a more traditional punk sound maybe you need to look elsewhere. This album is pop-punk at its finest and if you're into the progressing mxpx sound like myself then you'll probably enjoy it."
2,Not Very Good,"I have to admit, this CD was disappointing. After a great album like ""Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo"", ""The Ever Passing Moment"" wasn't very good. There were a few good songs (""My Life Story"", ""Responsibility"", ""The Next Big Thing"") but overall, most of the songs were nothing special. My friends all told me that this CD had deep lyrics, but what everyone else calls 'deep', I call 'cheesey'. In ""Buildings Tumble"" the chorus goes:""Let the weak say I am strong. Let yourself say I was wrong. Let your heart move on. Let your heart move on.""Blech! 'Let your heart move on'? Green Day managed to write a slow, thoughtful song with ""Good Riddance"" because it was SUBTLE. This chorus would be fine if it was for a Celine Dion song, but the result of those lyrics mixed with a punk-pop melody and a plugged-up nose is just sickening. MxPx is a really good band, and if you're looking for a CD that shows their true talent, don't buy ""The Ever Passing Moment""."
3,"Ok, But It sounds like Blink 182","It sounds like MxPx is trying to use the same formula that made Blink 182 famous. They made the music a bit softer, and the lyrics are very sappy. It sounds like a self-pity party, except for ""The Next Big Thing,"" which is also on the title screen of Supercross 2000 of Nintendo 64. All in all, it sounds like MxPx went soft to get a larger fanbase."
2,Suckage,"This album is not very good. I am a big fan of Life in General, At the show, and Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo but this sucks. I listened to it for about 2 weeks and then it cracked my backpack on a road trip. But I didn't care, becuase it sucked. It was boring, and it had no flavor. Not the Mxpx I used to know."
3,The Next Big Thing...,"YUp...bought the album a while back pretty close to its release. Its really really good dont get me wrong, its just different that their older stuff, less hard and fast more i dunno soft for lack of appropirate adjectives. Its good thought, i wasnt disapointed just kinda surprised at how gosh darn radio friendly it is. *shrugs* I still recommend though, lyrically its very strong. and its catchy too if ya like that. Good stuff good stuff but id rather run around to punk rawk show hehe."
3,Great for fans but not the place to start,"It's a cliche when a great or not so great artist releases a double-album to say ""it would have made a great single album had they paired it down."" Juliana Hatfield is truly a great artist - I can't think of a singer/songwriter I've enjoyed more in the last ten years - but these albums aren't her best work. Beautiful Creatures is the better of the two, with about eight of the ultra-hooky, ultra-intelligent songs which makes her so endearing. The rest seem unfinished or are a little flat. Total Systems Failure is less successful: with the exception of ""My Protege,"" ""Ten Foot Pole"" and a couple of swell punky numbers, these songs plod more than they rock. A must for fans, but not what I would play to convince the unconverted."
4,Neat little Yo Yo,"The clutch system in this yo-yo works, maybe a little too well. It seems to engage too soon. (i.e. there is more than enough momentum in the yo-yo for it to keep sleeping, yet the clutch returns it to your hand) The really nice feature is you can turn the clutch off. All in all its a good yo-yo for the price, great for beginners."
3,Sleeping Time,"My daughter quickly turned off the lock to enable 'sleeping'. Her only complaint is the sleep time is less than 10 seconds which limits the tricks she can try. Even when I try to force a long sleep time, I find it limiting. This has a Nylon bearing over a steel shaft so it may be a design issue. She has lubricated the bearing but saw no improvement. If she keeps playing with it, we may do some research and move up to a better design."
1,"Pass it on, I mean, pass on it!","An utter embarassment from a reggae legend. Dated production renders this disc virtually unlistenable. Get Blackheart Man instead, or Burnin' by the original Wailers."
1,A piece of felt and a wrapping paper roll,This was by far the worst item I've ever purchased on the internet. This was literally just a piece of green felt and a cardboard roll with a strap. The box that contained these items was all torn up when it arrived and looked like it had been opened 100 times. Please save your money and do not purchase this item.
5,Third World is WONDERFUL!,"If you enjoyed Dominic Miller's other solo albums, you will love ""Third World"", as well.It is calming.. lovely music to have playing in the background of everyday life. ""Seven Sisters"" is a wonderfully upbeat (although too short) track on this CD.The last track, ""Altea"" is listed at 21 minutes.. the first part of the track lasts for about 3 1/2 minutes.. then there is silence until about the last three minutes. But, don't miss out.. the end of this track is a wonderful. It's a bit faster paced than many of the other tracks and includes some spoken word in the background. It's quite enjoyable.If you enjoy the guitar make sure you check out Dominic Miller. You won't find the rock guitarist that has earned him the label of Sting's ""right AND left hand"", but you will find an amazing musician driven to express his unique creativity through this beautiful music."
1,Isn't petrolatum 100% better?,"After having read all the reviews, I had high hopes for Aquaphor for baby's eczema. It turned out to be a gooey, sticky mess that rubbed off on everything and was hard to remove: me, bedsheets, clothes, toys... I agree with the previous reviewer: isn't 100% petrolatum (aka, Vaseline) better than Aquaphor's 41% petrolatum? Also generic petroleum jelly is $2. Aquaphor is 8x more at a whopping $16. I do use the remaining Aquaphor for baby's diaper area, and it seems to be working as well as petroleum jelly. For baby's eczema, turns out Eucerin Cream worked better. If you're dealing with eczema, perhaps you can try Eucerin Cream to moisturize and then lock it in (like another reviewer wrote) with Aquaphor."
5,Dahk Knox is on target.,"Suicide is a death sentence for the soul. To believe otherwise is non-christian. People distort the word to be politicly correct, and I guess in KY suicide may be the christian thing to do. This book may offend those who have loved ones who killed themselves and have not come to terms."
4,book in very good condition,"The book apparently came from a public library and was in very good condition. It had no torn pages, highlighting of any kind, anywhere, and even had the spine reinforced with clear tape as libraries do. I was totally satisfied."
3,They don't last,"I think we've had four of these now in our family, total. While they work, they're great -- but none of them work any longer. The wires aren't very strong and eventually they frayed and broke at the exit point from the body and the devices stopped working.If you can get one with an extended warranty, you might consider that. We're going to try a different brand."
5,"Beautiful, sensitive film","I absolutely love Sidney Poitier. He brings sensitivity, compassion and intelligence to all his roles but especially in this movie. The ending is bittersweet but well done and realistic. You'll feel so much compassion for Selena's character and all that she's had to suffer in her young life."
5,A Patch of Blue,Saw this film a long time ago and it still is an amazing film. Will enjoy watching this over and over again.
3,A Timeless Classic,This movie is a timeless classic that will continue to live on. It is a well done version of the book...a good read.
3,Little more than pleasant,"Pleasant, effective, and unintrusive, but there is not much going on. It is... nice. The piano solos are lovely, and the thematic material and orchestrations are typically wonderful considering the composer, but, again, there is simply not much going on..."
3,Very Dated.,"A blind girl lives a life of squalor and abuse at the hands of her racist family. When she meets the cool collected newspaper reporter she falls madly in love.Sadly, he knows it can never be because she is blind and underage and he is black. A fact he never mentions to herAs a book, told from the girls perspective, this idea works but when presented as a movie it instead comes of like the audience and the other characters are playing a mean trick on some poor woman. While Gordon repeatedly bemoans the fact that she has been kept in darkness all her life and never taught to read or sent to school, he does nothing to provide her with the facts of the situation she is in. Instead he dances around the subject while preaching tolerance. Even in reguards to her own education she is never given the chance to make a choice or help direct her own life.A classic in its day that just looks dated now."
5,A Timeless Classic,"I remember seeing this movie as a child, and I was very impressed then, and I still am. I purchased the DVD because I remembered how much I enjoyed the movie as a child. When I watched it again, I appreciated it more because it was so important for its time. Racism and prejudice was rampant at the time this movie was made, in 1965. It speaks to the need for tolerance and justice back then, just as much as it does today. This was my first exposure to the talents of Sidney Poitier, and Shelly Winters won an Academy Award for her portrayal of the main character's abusive mother. I can't stress how touching and worthwhile this movie is. Watch it...I know you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
2,I AGREE THE LIVE VERSIONS ARE NOT THAT GOOD,"TRUST ME. NEIL DIAMOND IS NO SINATRA OR DEANIE MARTIN LIVE. PLUS THE RECORD IS MISSING SOME OF THE BEST SONGS LIKE DONE TOO SOON, ONE HAND ONE HEART AND HEARTLIGHT ARE NOT ON HERE. GET THE ORIGINAL GREATEST SONGS RECORDS INSTEAD OF THIS ONE."
5,Just great music,"Could not ask or expect a better product than "" the greatest hits "". People buy music for "" THE MEMORIES "",Neal Diamond's music makes you face reality. It's songs that we love, were getting older, and in aging, we still want the best around us."
2,Not up to Neil Diamond standards.,"I was very dissappointed in this CD. The big hits were all recorded live in a 1992 concert and were no where close to the quality of the original recordings of these big hits. I really missed the quality of his 1970 voice. The only reason I gave it a ""2"" rating was that it was Neil Diamond."
2,A Collection of Disappointment,"This two-CD set contains most of Neil Diamond's famous hits. However, this collection features many music selections from live performances--and, this is NOT a good thing. For example, in ""Cracklin' Rosie,"" a truly great ""sing along"" tune, Neil shouts the lyrics rather than sings them. When he does sing, he can't hit the notes he used to. Save your money, and stick with the original recordings and you'll be much happier."
2,Live performances of favorites dissapointing,"I bought this collection thinking it has most of my favorites. Good deal. But, not so. Unfortunately, the best, most classic ones, such as ""Sweet Caroline"" are not the original studio recordings. They are live recordings, not what I expected. Not great ones at that, even though the CD cover of ""13 previously unreleased"" seems to tout this a a great benefit. Overall the collection is not bad otherwise, but for these live recordings, which is unfortunately 13 out of the collection, including many of the classics, one of which is mentioned above."
2,Disappointing,"It's no longer possible to purchase Diamond's earlier albums in any format, although lengthy haunting of online auctions has netted lots of leads for vinyl (no thanks, already own them all) and a very few for CDs. I had hoped that this CD might get me the wonderful original versions of those great songs that I recall from the 70s, but there are only a couple of original recordings here: a few were later versions, and most were not particularly good live versions. Don't waste your money on this CD unless you really can't stand going the online auction route."
2,Don't waste your money on bad live recordings.,"I just got this from BMG and I plan on sending it right back. The over half of disc 1 is *live* recordings, not the original studio recordings. The live recordings are HORRIBLE. From the booklet... ""Some of these songs particularly lend themselves to the infectious nature of a performance in front of an audience, so we've included some live cuts, too."" That is a flat out LIE. The reason that there is live cuts on this cd is that they couldn't buy the rights to those songs to put them on this cd, so they just put these horrible live cuts on there. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$ on this!"
1,For All Of You Kenny G Fans,"This man has been singing the same song for about 30 years now. His voice becomes progressively more gravelly and worse. After the first few songs, you can just listen to the rapid decline."
1,I expected to hear familiar tunes but most of album is live.,"I was disappointed that most of his famous songs I remember are performed live on this album. I'm sure seeing him in person is great, but listening to his on-stage antics on a CD got old fast."
3,"""okay""","the neil diamond greatest hits cd is ""okay"". it's mostly a live concert of neil in his later years as opposed to single cuts of his greatest hits altho there are a few of them on there as well."
5,Great for Lactation Cookies,I bought these as an additive for my Lactation Cookies. It does the trick and does not affect taste or texture at all. I've had it for months now and baking a dozen weekly and am only about halfway through it.
3,Ok supplement,"We, the family are not vegetarians but I thought we could use the natural vitamins that brewers yeast contain. It is hard for me to add it to finished food and even harder for me to remember to add it to the cooking stage. The taste and texture is very distinct and hard to disguise with traditional foods and taste."
1,**Warning! This Product Isn't What It Says It Is!!!!**,"Ok this product is named ""100% Pure Brewers Yeast"" But, get ready for a supprise, it ain't brewers yeast!!! Well, it is, but it's dead! It should be named ""100% DEAD Brewers Yeast"" I'm trying my hand at home brewing to try to save a little money, and, well, this purchace didn't help me do that! Swanson did tell me ""If you send it back to us, we'll refund your money"" Yeah, Right! I'm gonna spend 5 or 6 dollars to return something for a refund, and only get $4.99 refunded! I didn't do great in school, but that just seems to me like they want me to loose even more money!"
5,Took me back to my teen years,"This was an amazing soundtrack. Exactly how I remember it. I've owned this before on tape years ago.I got my cd with Movie in a timely manner and it was safe, not broken.The price was fair too.Thanks for having this available. I feel 15 again!"
3,Bought for ONE song.,"I couldn't find the ""I Ain't Gonna Eat My Heart Out"" original song, so I had to buy this. Not a super compilation, but I happen to adore that song....and the covers on iTunes stunk."
1,Not as good as the other Frances books,"I am a big fan of Frances and I grew up reading many of the Frances books. I received a copy of this book as a gift recently and I was very disappointed. The story starts our wonderfully and Frances, her fears, and her interactions with her parents ring true, but I was very disappointed with the end... when her father makes her go to bed by threatening to spank her. What is the moral of the story? For the parent it seems to be that even if your child is frightened and having a hard time sleeping you should force him/her to go to bed and stop bothering you. For the child it seems to be that your fears are not valid and you shouldn't bother your parents with them. I would recommend skipping this book in favor of ""A Bargain for Frances,"" ""Bread and Jam for Frances,"" or ""Best Friends for Frances."""
1,This is the ONE Frances book to avoid,"I have found most books in this series to be very appealing to little children, and gentle and humorous into the bargain. However, this one could be all too easily misinterpreted! The story is based on the assumption that a child who cannot sleep is deliberately inventing excuses not to do so, and that genuine terror (which is a fact of life for many) that might cause such sleeplessness is imaginary and manipulative on the child's part, and can be dispelled by a fear of punishment.This would be devastating for a child to believe - but all the more dangerous were such a viewpoint held by a parent who may have a child who has genuine insomnia or night terrors. The rest of the Frances series is worthwhile, but this one is a nightmare."
4,Grease Karaoke,Well done. Anyone who likes to sing Grease songs will enjoy using this CD. I use this CD in rehearsals for my production of Grease when the accompanist is not available and it really keeps the flow of the production going. This would also be great for parties. Enjoy.
4,Grease Karaoke,The songs on the CD are just like they are played in the musical .... wish there had been a few more
1,Technocel Nokia antenna,This antenna is sub-standard and does not even have the dipole elements like the original on my 6185. It works about as good as the original antenna that had all the elements broken. Waste of money. Find a Nokia genuine replacement.
1,cheap... VERY cheap...,"very cheap piece of ""equipment""... i would never buy this if i had a chance to view it in a store... my loss, but it doesn't have to be yours... do not buy this, ever..."
5,"Well researched, fascinating book!","This highly fascinating book has just made my top 10 list of greatest books I've ever read. An obscene amount of research by the author went into it. I have the third edition and believe me this book answered a lot of cryptozoological questions I've had over the years. Read it with an open mind and never, never, NEVER go spelunking!"
1,Terrible,Everything about this movie is a lie. The story is not even about the titular character Keira. She's just there to capitalize on Pixar's new movie. The story is actually about some kid named Super Cloud. The story is also a rip-off of Disney's Hercules. Wish I could give it 0 stars.
1,Not Applicable's greatest performance yet!,"While the movie as a whole is lame, this is undoubtedly ""Not Applicable""'s finest movie. It is truly amazing to see how far he has come since ""6teen: Dude of the Dead""."
1,DVD did not contain Taiji!,"I ordered a copy of this DVD to learn Chen taiji silk-reeling exercises.When the DVD came, it did not contain taiji, but a grainy B&W; Chinese movie. I even tried it on the multistandard DVD player at work, same deal -- no hidden taiji files in Region 6 Chinese format.Amazon was great and sent me a replacement, but it was just the sameChinese movie, no taiji. I requested a refund after the second bad copy.I don't think I'd order another from this taiji series provider, too risky."
3,This movie is no exception,This is a psycho thriller as pointed by Vinod Pande. Vinod Pande is famous for making films with controversy and sex.This movie is no exception.The movie is OK. I don't think it will do much for Sherlyn Chopra the leading lady.
4,JAZZ THE ALMIGHTY,"Bob is alive everytime I listen this record, so different but so close from Bob's spirit."
5,An unbelievable Bruch,"This Mischa Elman's violin concertos album deserve being bought and listened for the pure sake of his two Bruch concertos performances.The magnificent musical ideas of Elman render the overplayed Bruch n.1 and the seldom played Bruch n.2 the most captivating performance we can imagine, as if they were two concertos never listened before!The recordings remount back to 1956, with Adrian Boult and London Philharmonic,Anatole Fistoulari and London Symphony respectively.Compared to Elman's rendition, the various glorified Heifetz,Ferras,Accardo and so on give only a faint interpretation of what this wonderful romantic violin music should sound."
3,Compact,The problem I am having is: The only wax that works for this product s the cream beads which is not pliable when I remove it and shatters into to pieces when I pull it. If I could use other wax the warmer is fine. The well isn't large enough to hold other containers of wax.
1,Do NOT download this document!,"The title of this download easily leads one to believe that they are downloading a digital version of this book. NOT so! Instead, it is a download of a one-page book review of this book. Not only that, you get to pay six dollars for it! Even if I were shopping for a book review, I would not pay six dollars for it. Unbelievable. Incredulous. I was duped. Hopefully you will read this review, and not be duped as well. I noticed that the author of this ""book review"" is a Ph.D. candidate of Texas Tech University. As an alum of Texas Tech University, I am embarrassed for my alma mater."
4,Good book to start drumming,"It's a nice book for your first drumming excercises.The CD with examples, one with, the next one without the drums, is an excellent way to practice."
1,Another too good to be true deal... FAKE LOUIS VUITTON!,This bag is an ILLEGAL FAKE! Don't waste your money. These sellers need to be removed from the Amazon Marketplace. They are selling illegal goods and ripping people off!!!!!BUYER BEWARE!
4,Denise Jannah is amazing,"I thoroughly enjoyed Denise Jannah's album ""The madness of our love"". I am novice to the jazz vocalist scene but I found Jannah's vocals and song selection great. The title song is a rich and melodic song that is perfect ""chilling"" music. On ""My Favorite Things"" Jannah delivers a beautiful but different rendition of the popular song. Denise Jannah is an amazing jazz singer and I would strongly suggest that anyone interested in jazz vocalists or Sarah Vaughan to purchase the album."
2,HE knows what he's talking about...,"Watkin knows his stuff. But I don't so I bought this book which didn't clear things up as much as I hoped. There are far too many details, not a sense of narrative through history. Then there are far too few photos of things he expose's so that I have to guess what he means. And no maps. My geographic knowledge is not that good. I think it could be improved by streamlining, photos near the text which refers to them, and a map at the start of each section. But his prose is beautiful sometimes."
1,Not what you see...,Received my lights today. Shipping very prompt but the product you get does not look like the picture. Looks like Peace sign is nicely painted or embossed on plastic but instead they are just stickers on plastic.The price with shipping does not justify the product you get. I ordered 2 sets and was charged shipping price for each set instead of a combined rate. Made this purchase way overpriced. These remind me of flea market quality.
4,"A good read, but disturbing","I enjoyed this book, but only gave it 4 stars because the subject matter was very hard for me to read. If you have any relatives in nursing homes, this story will hit home. The plot is all the more disturbing because it is based on true events from a real nursing home. West again creates characters who are dynamic and persever even when faced with amazing odds."
1,Please be careful when purchasing this item...,"because it is misrepresented. It is way too small with a measured reach of maybe a foot. I am an artist and was hoping to use this to supply additional light and magnification for my desk but for that purpose it is essentially uselss. I went to a well known office supply store and for the same money, found a much better gooseneck lamp. Needless to say, I am returning this item."
3,Not bad for a first album,"Some good cuts on this one, and still ""listenable"" after 25 years. Highlights include The Band's ""The Shape I'm In"" and one Marty helped pen, ""Maria.""Nice guitar work and even better mandolin.Pick it up if you're a Marty fan."
5,Bob Snyder's songs of faith..,"As a disclaimer I must admit to being a long time fan and friend of Bob but having said that, my praise of this cd is objective and warranted. Bob is unquestionably one of the best clarinetists/saxophonists playing today. This collection of songs of faith is wonderfully performed and well recorded. I give it my highest praise. Well done Bob!"
4,Excellent Parenting Guide,"I frequently used this parenting guide (and video) for counseling parents.Very clear, uncomplicated solutions for everyday child behavior challenges.The accompanying video to this program shows the techniques in practice.Loretta Kelly, MSW"
4,Legends & Lore,"This book was fun and when followed by the actual Key West ghost tour that departs from the Concha Hotel, you will want to go back and read it again. It does not try to convice you or spook you, it just states as many facts as they were able to verify. The rest is left to you to believe or disbelieve. Fun reading, with short chapters. Good bedtime stories to read by yourself or to read out loud to your parter before going to sleep."
2,Its OK,"Santa got this for my 2yr.9mo. daughter. She Loves to put the baby in the carrier. She dosn't like the bouncer, she has a hard time getting the toy rack on and because upset. I thought she would like the bike to push the baby around but everytime I put the baby in it she takes it out. When we go out she does put the baby in the carrier and takes it everywhere, but she does get tired of holding it and then it because older sisters job."
4,Provactive,"Although this book is fantasy of the first order....it is quite thought provoking as well.It leads the reader to question not only the way THEY look at things, but also the way society as a whole chooses to buildtheir core belief system on what may not always be ""divine leadership.""A quick read, but a long mental debate this one!"
5,Very insightful,"Working very hard to incorporate wisdom from sources like this that help promote honesty, and how to really live the way one wants."
2,This book does not adequately explain its concepts,"This book does not adequately explain the concepts of multivariable calculus. The ideas and concepts presented in each section often do not provide the reader w/ enough to solve the excercise problems, even with the example problems included. I would not have bought this book if it had not been mandatory for a class I took at Baylor University."
4,good collection of tips!,My parents gave me this book for Christmas and I've already used many of the tips. I think that this book should be issued to all college students.
2,Stretchie Slipper Shoes from Foot Smart.,I intend to send the two pairs of Stretchies shoes that I purchased from Foot Smart. The sizing is off for my foot size and these slipper colors bleed off on to my socks.I have only worn these shoes a few times and I am quite disappointed with this product. They don't fit and are not very comfortable because they are simply too loose.Don't waste your money by purchasing Stretchie Slippers from Foot Smart.
2,"""5 Equations"" could use improvement","I was dissapointed in ""5 Equations."" I read it because it was a selection that my book group had chosen. The book is basically a history of science book with a little math mixed in. I found many of the biographies lacking in depth and the ""Veni, Vidi, Vici"" format was sometimes confusing for me. The Newton and Bernuli sections were especially confusing because I found it difficult to always understand what generation the author was talking about unless I really went through and thought about it. That was quite frustrating. The only redeeming quality of the book is that even though the biographies lacked depth, they were able to provide a glimpse into the thinking of the scientific community."
5,Put this on your list!!,This is a need read book. Insightful and bravely done.Gives a person a glimse into the mind set of the left and how a once much needed influence in our society has gone amuck.
5,A must-read for anyone!,This great book in the Brainship series is adventure and romance combined to make one wonderful book!
4,"Difficult subject, well dealt with","The story of the little kitten, who's daddy disappears, and Mummy is bad to him, is well written and non judgemental. The kitten is taken away from his birth mother and fostered, then adopted into a family of Swans, who love him. The book tells about the kitten's confusion and feelings of loss, and has a happy ending when the adoptive parents re-state their love for him.This book is relevant for children who have been removed from a birth parent's home, not for children adopted after being orphaned or abandoned, and the picture of the scary Mum will probably introduce the wrong message about their birth parents."
3,"A starting point, I guess","This book has a good story and attempts to relate a very horrible experience to children. I give it 5 stars for that. I don't like how it uses the term, ""real parents"" in referring to Zachary's birth parents. However, I understand that as a child, that is exactly what is thought. Reading it to my adopted son and our other children as we prepare to foster in the hope of adopting again, I cringe at the term. Our son only knows us as his parents. How do I explain ""real"" to him when we've been saying ""first"" since we started talking about it?Other than that, I think it is an okay book. Both of my older children ask to read it often. They both tend to feel sorry for ""poor Zachary"" -- not sure it that's a good thing or not."
3,"This band is good, but not great Could have done a better job","The 80's and early 90's saw an influx of coutry bands on the heels of the success of Alabama..unfortunately, most of these turned out to be 1 hit wonders.....this is one of those bands"
5,Very good,"I am a layperson in political philosophy. I found the book comprehensive and easy to understand. Actually, I had borrowed the book at first from a libray and then decided to purchase it, because I found it so good and helpful in my understanding of our political and social systems and the underlying philosophical thoughts."
5,Intricate and emotional,"I am a fan of Donald Windham and have been for the past ten years. I feel he is one of the most important writers of the century and has never enjoyed the wide audience he so much deserves. I have always thought his Atlanta memoir, EMBLEMS OF CONDUCT, to be one of the best I've ever read. THE DOG STAR brilliantly covers much of the same terrain in many ways, but is fiction. Depression-era Atlanta is certainly not the Atlanta of today, but the themes that run through the pages of THE DOG STAR are timeless and should be read by everyone seriously interested in Southern literature."
5,Kind of the best thing.,"I bought this as a ridiculous gift for a friend going through a rough time; it turned out to be one of those pieces that ends up in every photo of every trip throughout the summer. Oh, and it's educational or something."
5,I love giant microbes!,any science geek would love these guys. We keep E. coli on our bathroom shelf to 'greet' our guests. We actually have 5 different microbes scattered about our home. They've sparked more than their fair share of amusing conversations. Our 10 year old neice (possibly another budding scientist) also loves them.
1,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY--- Returned all the ones I ordered after I got them,"For the price I expected something better constructed, larger............ these were super small and hard-stuffed. Not what I expected at all!!!"
5,This book is Awesome....,Anyone out there who has any doubt of Simpson's guilt needs to read this book. Absolutey 100% Guilty! Vince is a masterful writer who without a doubt will be a best-selling author for years to come.
2,"Sensationalism, nothing more.","I believe the sick publicity surrending Simpson murder case played by the media to overshadow the Rodney King case.Also, I did NOT pay for this book. I borrowed it, thank goodness. The author (along with MANY others) have earned ""blood money"" vice profit from this murder case. Anyone who writes a book about this bizarre and ugly case should be ashamed."
3,Nothing to compmlain about here....,Not an outstanding piece of work but not a bad one either. Fans of her previous two albums will like this one too.
2,Tough to get on,"This costume is super cute and the size is pretty accurate. However, there are no snaps for the legs (which is quite silly for an infant outfit) and there is only a little opening at the neck to get the child in putting the feet in first. I called the company and they said, sorry it's a cheap costume and you can just cut the seem in the back to get him in the costume easier. I won't buy from this company again."
5,a great album,"When Darling Buds were around, they were never my favorite band but I did make a point of checking out each of their albums when they were released. 15 years on from their final album ""Erotica"", I find myself pulling it out rather frequently and enjoying it more and more. Seriously, this album holds up so well, much better than I ever would have thought. At the time it was an enjoyable album but felt too derivative of current trends in British indie rock (could they have more blatantly shown the influence of My Bloody Valentine?) to really be great. Now I hear that these are fantastic pop songs that stand the test of time in ways that a lot of their contemporaries' songs don't. Sure, I still love Lush and My Bloody Valentine, but The Darling Buds at their finest have an energy and charm missing from those other groups. This is truly a record worth discovering (or rediscovering)!"
4,For display only,"This is a very cute novelty item, and it is excellent for displaying. I would not recommend it as a toy though, as it is not durable enough"
3,just for the conclusion,"So many reviews already, just wanted to add my rating to the overall score.Third book in the series, since Menolly was only in some of this book I did not like it as much but they did conclude Menolly and Sebell's relationship so it was worth the read."
4,entertaining,"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons. These books are always wonderful, well written, and perfectly characterized. All of her series are great but the ones that take place on Pern are the best of all."
5,A magical kingdom filled with heroic deeds and honesty,"I'm thirty now and spend most of my time reading manuals for work or historical autobiographies, but every once in a while I like dipping back into my wonder years and sailing off with a novel or story that's close to my childs heart. Anne McCaffrey and her Drgonsong series does just this for me. If you want your kids growing up loving literature, this is a great place to begin"
1,Don't believe the hype,"I bought this book (used and expensive) thinking this would finally bring some powerful over-the-top magic to rolemaster. I was wrong. This is pretty much the same as always (""caster gains +5 against heat attacks for 2 rounds"" or ""caster can perfectly remember one image(once per rank)""etc.). The 3 normal spell law books (and, more so, the companions) are quite enough. Save your money."
4,Pencil Points Good History of Architectural profession,"This is a great overview of Pencil Points articles of interest since its beginning. I really enjoyed reading the articles written on the history of the profession and information on the training of draftsmen and their transition into the architect role. Many of the young practitioners of today would do well to see from whence their profession came from, and the rigors of training as apprentices before the collegiate route became the norm. The computer has radically changed our profession. May be not all for the good.Ronald L Peters AIA"
3,Should be on DVD.,"The opening fight scene is legendary. Golf ball crushing, eyeball stabbing, punching through the roof of a police car, ninja star to the face, this fight has it all! The ninja even throws a star with his foot and shoots a dart down the barrel of a gun!A woman is possessed by an evil ninja who uses her body to avenge his death. That's cool and the kill scenes are cool, especially the one at the cemetery, but unfortunately the woman also has a hairy boyfriend whose main habit is to show off the hair on his shoulders while talking a lot about nothing.Even with the hairy guy slowing down the pace NINJA III: THE DOMINATION manages to secure itself as a minor masterpiece in the ninja genre thanks to the martial arts skills of Sho Kosugi and David Chung. Also look for James Hong in a minor role.You're not a true ninja fan until you've got this movie in your collection."
3,Ah....the memories,"Remember that time when you were in high school and you thought clubbin', thugs, and having lots of money without actually having to work for it were all ""cool beans?"" This book brings back all of that flavor. Don't go into it expecting to connect with the characters--any of them. Just read it with a great amount of suspension of disbelief, and you will enjoy it very much.I love the club scene. I love the ""playboy"" the main character falls in love with, who actually turns out to be sincere this time. I love the idiot criminals. Enjoy a fun read!"
4,Just another repackaging,"Where some ""best-of, volume 2"" collections of an artist are a chronlogical continuation of their charted hits, this disc is a second tier of hits that fell between and around the chart-toppers achieved by Ross with the various Supremes members and on into the post-Ross groups' material. Unless you're complementing the volume one disc and have no other Supremes CD's, there is little here to warrant purchase.The promotional hook about remastered stereo versions yields little satisfaction. Some of the earlier tracks (""My World..., for example) are even muddier here than on other compilations and are hardly an improvement over what is available elsewhere.This redundant collection serves as a mid-price, hits-only, no filler, Supremes music marathon. That in itself is fine, there's just nothing really new here if you've already got other Supremes' collections. And technically, there is no real step up here to warrant purchase if that is a consideration."
1,Crap,"Agree with previous reviewer. It's plastic! VERY CHEAPLY MADE! If you just need something to get you by, then this will work. If you want something that will last - than this is not the product for you."
1,A load of nothing,"This book shared a lot of information about nothing. Amongst one chapter, there is a tad of important information but it is an extremely incomplete review. I needed a review of theorists, terms, main strategies, etc. There is information about drug abuse, emotional issues, and community involvement--all of which require pure common sense, not a study guide."
1,Deceptive photo of product,"As was the case with another reviewer who thought he/she was buying the product pictured, I too was left looking for the ""missing"" components (in my case, the lights). Only later did I discover that they were not included. Amazon, this is not good quality control on your part or your contractor's."
2,Who do they get to write these things?,"I only made it through the first two chapters before returning this book. The writers may have their MCSE's, but they sure don't have a sound, fundamental understanding of networking. I've been doing this for twelve years and the text, as far as I read it, had plenty of inconsistencies. I must conclude that at least the individual(s) responsible for the first 2 chapters don't have much real-world experience. Are you interested in just passing the exams and being a ""paper-MCSE"" or being valuable to a real employer? If the former, then you'll be happy with this work. If the latter, then get the books from IDG."
1,A disappointment.,"There must be more to dreams than we know. As a result I've recorded, investigated, read extensively and experimented. After all I also dream. My interest waned some until rekindled after Creative Dreaming by P. Garfield suggested ""dream telepathy"". That is so exciting. The title Mutual Dreaming entices and I hoped it might open a door but alas Ms. Magallon's book is but a compilation of dreams or stories that may or may not suggest mutuality and offers nothing that doesn't smack of fiction. What a disappointment."
5,Great Resource!!,"SAS Macro Programming Made Easy, Second EditionFor anyone learning SAS-Macro from scratch, this could be the right reference book. I tried using online resources, I was more confused than convinced. It starts with baby steps for beginners....easy to understand. Price worth paying for.Most satisfied with this purchase!!!! If need be, I will hunt for the books by this writer."
1,don't buy this,"wooden pegs are either too large or too small, none fit correctly which makes it very unsturdy. take you money elsewhere."
3,Good aquarium but a little dark,"I expected brighter colors of the fish, more of them and more light in the aquarium. It is relaxing to have on. The high def is just fine."
2,Feit Electric NL9/LED Motion Sensor LED Night Light,"I can't get it to work at night. I've even put tape across the sensor and when I think is working without lights, I turn on the room light on and then off and it doesn't come on. I may question the company or dealer."
5,I love it!,"This is the first woodworkers vise that I have ever owned, and I did as much research as possible before buying. I found at least four models in various 'box' stores and woodworkers stores. Every one seemed crudely made. I compared a few models available from Amazon, but lacked enough experience to make an informed choice. I ordered the Wilton because of the generally favorable reviews. It looks and feels like a quality tool. I think that I will like the fact that the screw is covered by the frame, and will not easily collect dust. My first serious use was to debark some small logs. I found that the outside jaw face swiveled nicely to provide a firm grip on almost any log, the mechanism was quick to operate and a pleasure to use, and there was no 'give' whatsoever when I peeled off large strips of wood with my drawknife.I am really happy with my choice."
2,outdated and tacky,"really enjoyed the 1st song- ""lo hare por ti"". other than that there were 2 ok songs (""sin aire"", ""mirame a los ojos""), and the rest of the album was outdated, shallow, and disappointing.. sounds like a million things i've heard b4."
3,Pulina- used cd,"I like this cd, actually I bought it used in order to replace the cd which was stollen from me 1 yr. ago, however, the description in the used cds said ""very good condition, like new"" and the cd have scratches in the back."
1,Counter productive product!,This shreds and gets stuck in your teeth. Good luck getting it out. My husband and I spent over an hour getting it out of his teeth. HORRIBLE product!
4,really great spices and herbs and much more affordable then the supper markets,"i give these spices and herbs thumbs up compared to the ones i bought at the supper market,i paid under $4.00 at amazon for a large container,compared to $7.00 or more at the supper market for a tiny jar and the shipping is really fast.the only thing i miss with these large jars is the shaker caps."
3,Series running out of steam by season three,"The episodes following the ones pertaining to the discovery of Caines brother are filler. By season three, they seemed to be not taking their time with production detail. The pacing of the episodes in the first two seasons were wonderful to behold ( especially compared to TV produced today for the ADD crowd ). I feel Caradine had fully explored his character by the end of season three and can understand his moving on. Story lines not as solid in third year as first two seasons ( except for those involving finding his brother ). Definitely worth purchasing, but cannot compare to excellence of first two seasons."
4,Fine,"It got here quickly and in great condition. I am happy. Personally I think the second season was not as good as the first, and the third season not as good as the second. But if you like Kung Fu, you'll still be happy."
4,Try it you'll liiike it...!,"If your a fan, you get more back stories and plot resolution. What more could you want? Also, it's easy to see why David C. left after this season. But still worth the money."
2,Audio portion is missing,"This is my first kindle purchase, the audio portion is missing on the ipad version. This book is not that organized, kind of seems like someone kept a notebook and then just printed it.Thoughts ?"
4,Reccomened for intermediate bassists,"This book is for you if:You already know your way around the fingerboard, and know some theory, and have a solid beginner's grasp of the instrument, and are looking for some ways to improve or aid your playing/gigging, *outside* of basic technique, reading and theory.many useful tips, some more so than others, depending on your level. An excellent supplement to the fundamentals."
3,"Not ""good ol' Jack"", by a longshot...","Like many of the other ""reviewers"" that have posted before me, I have been a LONG-time fan of Jack Higgins. Some of my favorite novels (and even movies!) include The Eagle Has Landed, The Eagle Has Flown, Dillinger, Night of the Fox, etc. Okay, granted, I guess some of my favorites have been when he has revisited World War II, but I have also enjoyed many of his books with Sean Dillon, Charles Ferguson, etc. al. This book, however, left me thinking: Is this the same author? Or is it his high school aged understudy?Honestly, I hope the writing improves with his next few books (I am way behind in catching up with all of his stuff), but if not...I may never have to read the remaining books, because the line between ""Okay"" and ""I didn't like it"" is pretty close on this one.Sorry, Jack...."
2,Feels like a Rushed Job to me,My sentimentals are like the others: I think Jack Higgins is ready to move on from Sean Dillon. I was very saddened about the loss of Hannah Bernstein who's death was very unnecessary. How do you leave a top agent in the organization unattended. The plot was full of holes and Greta fate was unclear. This isn't Higgins best. Read Dark Justice instead.
2,not his best,"I managed to finish reading this book in the hope that it would get better. It never did. I've enjoyed many of his previous works, but this is the worst of his that I have read. I probably should have given it one star instead of two. Save your money."
3,It's getting a little monotonous,"I have read all of Jack Higgins' books, inclusing those written under his known psuedonyms. Typically, I have enjoyed his writing immensely, as it mixes places, action, mystery, and excitement. Unfortunately, that seems to be missing with each new effort. I am growing tired of the same cliches that Sean Dillon uses, the purported tie to the US and President Cazalet and Blake Johnson, the Salters, etc. It seems tired and forced, and dated. The characters all speak in a fashion that indicates that they are from the fifties, sixties, and seventies. The plotlines are predictable.Don't get me wrong; I have loved Jack Higgins' writing for many years, and will continue to read all of his new efforts. I just hope that there is something new in his future writings.I give this book a ""3""."
3,Average,"I enjoy reading Jack Higgins. This is average for him, which simply means I enjoyed it, but it is not memorable."
3,Check your specs,"Be sure that your ExpressCard is USB based before ordering. PCMCIA ExpressCard products, such as the Verizon wireless cards, won't work. I now gather (and others more technically oriented should feel free to chime in here) there are two different types of ExpressCards. Nothing in the Verizon literature makes that clear, but at least this product is well labelled - it just won't work with the other type of cards."
4,"Good, but needed more . . .","The haircutting system described in this book made sense, but I found several steps confusing, with pictures that didn't seem to match the step being described. As a non-professional with no schooling in the art of a good haircut/style (just a life-long passion for it), I was longing for just such a book to help me give more than just decent haircuts to my family. I was left wishing this one had been a bit clearer in spots with a few more pictures pertaining to the actual steps. Still, the general idea of the system seems excellent."
5,Hackin' 'n' Slashing,"Well, I doubt that I'll ever have occasion to get involved in a fight while my Bowie is close enough to get to...but, I feel pretty well prepared if I do!Coming at this book as a swordsman, I very much enjoyed the points the author made on the applicability of fencing technique to the bowie knife. The Bowie and Big Knife Fighting system is an easy read, an interesting book and a practical form and style guide covering stances, attacks and defenses.This book is friendly to read and pretty easy to follow. Plenty of historical information about how the American knife fighting style came to be (The best of European heavy on the Scott please.) If I loose this book or it gets stolen, I will immediately buy another copy!"
4,a gritty Boston tale,Well told and acted. Lots of Boston scenes and faces. How did they get in jail to film this? A better than average true tale story.
1,Don'y buy HP 78 from this company,"It is a fake one, not a origianl HP product.I hate they cheat...Why Amzon can not see consumer's reviewIt is a lier company"
3,"One Good, One Bad","I order two cartridges from them. One of the worked in perfect working condition, the other had ink seeping through the outside of the box. For the price it's okay, but they are some quality problems."
2,crap,tree came broken in 5 areas. one of the arms looks as if it was super glued back together very poorly and crooked. looks nothing like the picture. paint is faded and looks as if it was colored with a crayon by a 6 year old.
5,Great reference! :-),"The problem with most reference material comes from its inability to explain complex ideas and techniques clearly and concisely. For the newbie, this book is a great way to learn about FCP3. For the FCP3 veteran, it's a wonderful reference for learning new features of this program."
1,"UGGH, more anti Israel Propaganda from a Feminist","This book, is an easy read, not terribly intellectual or well researched. However, the most glaring issue is the one that is not discussed. How an one be a feminist, gay, and demand equal rights when non of the aforementioned would be allowed in ""Palestine"". When gay men are hung in the town square, and free speech is not allowed, it is easy to critique Israel and call this contry names, and you are free to do so. However, the real victims of the Intifada are not only the Israeli's, but the Palestinians who had to live under the rape of Palestine by Arafat, (Suha his ""wife"" is now living in a 15,000.00 dollar a day hotel suite in Paris), and the current rape of the land by HAMAS. Ms. Gluk should try to change the ways of terrorists and those who plunder public funds, and then lets address peace."
5,"What cay you say, It's Marvin Gaye","Hey, he is a classic and a treasure. Too bad, he is not with us today."
4,Great price Great vendor,Received the product in a very timely manner and the water tastes great. The price was the best out there....and I looked A LOT
3,OK as a beginner's guide to Exchange Server,"I bought this book in a bit of rush about a year ago because I was starting a new contract with a company upgrading to 5.5, and my experience was with 4.0 and 5.0. For me this book told me nothing I could not find out for myself by a couple of hours playing with V5.5 or just reading the release notes. However a beginner may find it a reasonable introduction, but it isn't post MCSE material."
4,Just as pictured & described,Needed extra light along work area and this fit the bill. Just as described. Shipped fast. Can accommodate more than a 40W bulb and wanted that.
1,RIP OFF,"The ring is fake. I haven't even had this for half a year, and the ""gold"" has faded on the sides. Oh, and it doesn't even look real."
4,Was a good read.,It was a very good book and I learned a lot about myself. I had heard the authors on the radio and thought the book was geared to helping marriages but it's about relationships in general.
5,Nice tool for your tool bag. Hvac tech a must own,"Nice product and a must own for any Hvac tech. This is much faster and accurate than pulling out a multimeter. It's small, lightweight and comes with a nice zipper pouch. Although the over all feel of this product is cheap, for the money and accuracy it's def worth the money. I recommended it to all my co workers. 90% of them after using mine bought one,"
4,The christmas album,This is a very soulful album with some beautifully sung tracks. A nice album for the christmas CD collection. Well worth a listen!
2,CHRISTMAS CD DISAPPOINTMENT,Being a great fan of Gladys Knight and the Pips and looking forward to this Christmas CD was a sad disappointment.There are a few good songs but not enough to buy it!
2,The Others Were Better,"This book was too quick, and the characters developed too quickly. I thought that the first Long, Tall Texan book (Calhoun, Justin & Tyler) was great, but this one lacked substence. Emmette's story was the worst. First he hates Melody then he wants to marry her and have a baby with her after just one day. That is just so unrealistic. Not my favorite Long Tall Texan, I wouldn't waste my time if I were you."
1,Rip Off!,"This product picture IMPLIES you will get one dozen pencils. I ordered 3, expecting 36 total pencils and I received only 3 pencils! I paid almost $6 for shipping, too! Know your supplier before you purchase!"
3,Not worth reading,I did not like this book. My biggest complaint with it is that the plot and character development is very poor. The development of a relationship between Faith and Nicholas is also poor. I would not recommend Faith or June. The only one worth reading is Hope.
1,What happened to Lori Copeland?????,"Lori Copeland is usually an excellent author. I've been reading her books for years, and I've enjoyed all of them. So, when I found out that she was writing Christian romance, I had very high hopes. (The first romance novels I ever got into were Christian romance(Janette Oke)).This book was dreck. It was awful. The characters were boring. The plot dragged. The storyline was not well thought out. AND, I kept reading hoping to get some of the life, or cleverness, or spirit of *FUN* that was in her other novels - it never showed up.Just because its Christian doesn't mean it can't be interesting...what happened? Please, let the excellent author that you were come back!!! And to anyone reading this review find one of her earlier books, those were well worth reading."
3,Condition worse than I anticipated,"The paperback that I received was twisted a noticable amount, otherwise was in ok condition.We needed it to fill in a missing book in a series in our church library."
3,Not a Movie One Would Want to Watch More than Once,"After having been burned numerous times by purchasing movies with great reviews by movie critics, I now generally read what the public feels about the movie before I make a decision to purchase, or not purchase it. This was one of those movies that received OK reviews by the public, but nothing special. I took a chance and purchased it. I doubt that I will ever watch it again in the future. The story is fairly weak whereas the locations, color and sets are top quality. The movie certainly has its weak points in terms of the script. Examples are when one of the students is shot and no one goes to his rescue, even though a crowd is present and the killer has fled. The police do not disperse the crowd even though the shooter is still in the vicinity. While it is implied and somewhat shown that one of the characters is innocent of a past crime, I kept waiting for an explanation of what really happened and why the person would not talk about it."
5,definitive space,"I had recently purchased Edge of a Fairytale liked it and decided to purchase another between interval cd. Wow! Autumn is a great choice. Deep,intelligent,sometimes dark,but ultimately optimistic space music, this is a beautiful album. For me this is definitive space music. I love Steve Roach but sometimes his dissonances can overwhelm the comforting spirit of his music. Between Interval doesn't sacrifice intelligence for a soothing, out of this world musical journey. Highly recommended, this has become my favorite!!"
1,Not even for magnetic ballast fluorescents,"I installed this switch and my magnetic ballast fluorescent lights come on with about half the normal brightness and they flicker. When I move the switch to ""on"" the lights operate normally. I tested the voltage and found that when the switch is on ""on"" I get 120 volts to the light but when it is on ""auto"" I get only 107 volts -- not enough to get the lights started."
4,Works great!,"Easy to install, works well. I have not yet adjusted the time duration, but I understand how to from the instructions."
5,5 guys named more,This product arrived quickly and in great shape. No problems. Enjoy the music from this broadway show. reminds me of when I saw it in person
3,decent film,"I stumbled across this film by accident a couple of years ago. I would this is not the best, for an action film. However, for those who think that this is supposed to be a martial arts; think again. It's a low budget B movie. Take it for what it is. The acting isn't the best, but that's to be expected. I still have this one in my collection. If you like the odd ball, rare comedies (there were only a few) from Troma, you might like this film. That said, it's not for everyone. I certainly liked it, though."
2,Don't buy this stand!,"I was completely disapointed in this purchase. I thought I would save a few bucks and I definately got what I paid for. The construction and design are not what I expected in a portable miter saw stand, definately not something that would hold up moving from job site to job site. And to top it off it did'nt fit my saw. My 10"" Hitachi has a three hole mount which this ""universal"" stand could not accomidate. It took over a week for their customer service department to get back to me about the issue and by then I was over it. luckily Amazon has a great return policy. I found a great price on the Trac-Rac stand on ebay and I'm very pleased with it. I would recomend that over HTC any day. I will say however, if you are just looking for something to keep in the garage and aren't doing any serious wood working the PM6000 might be a good fit. If you do base, case, crown and any type of carpentry for a living, don't but this saw. You will be bummed."
1,what happened?,I still havent gotten my product..... what happened. I would really like to recieve it so please figure out what happened and respond as soon as possible.
4,Not as good as the fist season,"The O.C. is one of my favorite TV shows, but I think that the first season was better than this season. The plot is still there but is less interesting. I hope that the new season brings back the good show the fans are waiting for."
1,Teen series!,"Ok! This is a good entertainment for evenings when you don't have nothing else to do. Then you maybe enjoy to watch these people's adventures and relationship problems. Don't think too much and you will get more for this.Unfortunately, I have always better things to do than waste my precious time to watch this teen series.I can clean my toilet, eat worms and run naked on the football stadion."
5,California...Here we Come,"The 2nd Season was just as good as the 1st, and the finale was breathtaking. However, the widescreen format, gives it a different look, not sure if I like it. it makes everything look like a movie. The shoting alone, is worth the money."
1,Beware of VOTF,"VOTF is an organization based on deception. They do not represent ""the faithful"" but only those Catholics with a left wing agenda and that have been around for years (Call to Action, etc)reconsituted under a new and more appealing title for those who are not aware. The membership numbers that they claim is only a list of email addresses that they collect from thier web-site and not true members. They are using the abuse crisis as rocket fuel to forward an agenda that is mostly against Catholic teaching and tradition. I suggest that you go to the VOTF website and see what Muller's ""vision"" of the church really is verses what he claims it is in public and your eyes will be opened wide. I am sure the content of this vision is not included in the book because he doesn't want the public to know this right away."
3,It's ok,"I am mildly disappointed with this lamp. It is not as pretty as the picture shows it and like the other buyer the felt was loose on the bottom. Fortunately, my husband was able to fix it. I also didn't like how it was packed. The shade was in a box from a different type of lamp and the base was bubble wrapped. Also, there was no invoice."
5,rips up da hizouse,"Like typical Heavy D this CD is tight. I love it. Heavy D keeps it real. He's the best old skool rapper ever. I saw him in fresh prince one time too. He is the best rapper ever, peace out homie"
2,"Mediocre cable, but it gets the job done","I received the cable in good condition and promptly from the seller. When I hooked it up to my Panasonic TV (at first in the side RCA slot) I noticed I didn't get any sound from my computer. However, by switching to the RCA slots in the back on my TV, I was able to get the sound to work.The sound quality on this cable is mediocre. My TV's speakers are not spectacular, but the sound from this cable was tinny and muffled even for my TV. Also, when the RCA cables were plugged in, it caused these moving horizontal lines to appear on the screen. It also darkens the image from the PC cable. Unplugging either the RCA plugs or the 3.5mm jack made the lines go away, so it was definitely a result of the cable.Either way, I'm going to hang on to this cable. It gets the job done, about as well as expected for the price."
3,6' audio Y-cable,This cable works fine but is not as shown in the picture. The pix shows gold plated plug ends of which I figured the price was not that steep considering. The cable works fine now and I hope it will continue to do so in years to come. Past experience with rca type audio connectors is the gold plated ones seem to retain their audio signal transfer a bit better later on down the road especially in damp/humid conditions..recommend the pix is corrected or supply the gold plated cable ends. Thanks Rhino
4,....and sweet.,"Christ, its been 13 years since this came out and I forgot all about it. Still holds up nicely. Not terribly grundgy like other stuff from this era, sometimes I detect the Meat Puppets but then maybe not. ""Hell Of a Message"" is a supertasty song. ""Marilyn"" is plenty nice too, dreamy like.... et"
5,Miranda,"This book is written in a little bit different style than most of Hill's books. I enjoyed it tremendously. Miranda is an out-spoken and kind hearted woman who has been waiting for love it seems all her life. When she encounters a neighbor's son, he reminds her of his older half-brother, Alan. Because Miranda had loved Alan for years, she helps out his younger brother, especially since his father marries for the 3rd time!"
4,Dolphin Diaries,"Dolphin Diaries by Ben M. Baglio was and incredible book. It was about this girl named Jody and how she is going on a trip for a couple of months on a boat called the Dolphin Dreamer and she has exiting adventures. There was tons of excitement, my favorite part was when Jody falls off the boat during a really bad storm and the dolphin is the only one who can rescue her or she will drown even though she is a good swimmer. My least Favorite part was when a snobby girl named Brittney joins the trip and almost ruins the whole trip for Jody.The story can be very useful when it comes to friends and peers, you need to look past first impressions, because maybe they are going through something hard to deal with, or they are just having a bad day and are taking it off on you.If I was to rate this book I would give it four stars because I think that the book could have been a little more detailed, but other than that it was very exhilarating and eye-popping book."
4,Dolphins from human perspective,"These books are about dolphins from a human perspective and are very nice. Some readers might also like a book from a dolphin perspective that occasionally mentions humans, which is Ocean Echoes: A Dolphin Tale by Shaney Frey. Ocean Echoes is for mature adolescents and adults. It contains a few scenes that are not appropriate for younger children. However, for the teen and adult readers it might be a nice complement."
5,Great gift for a child,"Hi, bought this book for one of my grandsons. Yes, he is too little to appreciate it and will tear the pages, but I was feeling nostalgic about Richard Scarry, since his father (my son) loved the books so much. It is high quality and well done, worth the extra cost. I'll now go back and purchase the age appropriate books for him from the same author."
2,Fantasy Driven Man Flick,"Man flicks where a fantasy chick falls for the most unlikely of possibilities is pure formula for all the guys still living in their fantasy wishful thinking world. That's a sizable market!Rates two stars because yes, she's hot and there were a couple of uniquely funny quips.The rest of the movie is just formula:(a.) Lead male hangs with nerdy man crew; has offbeat family; competes with stud male competitor; has a loser job and a bland personality; has no skills or accomplishments.(b.) Lead female, well, still hot; also is a wealthy ex-lawyer. Main role in movie is to smile a lot but who cares.Although the demographic of 5 star reviewers is, as expected, male there might be an audience for the female fantasy world here too."
5,Great movie!,Great movie. No problems with the product. Works greats. Awesome movie. My boyfriend loves it. He won't stop watching it!
5,"Half raunchy humor film, half chick flick","This movie is a lot like 'The Hangover' with some raunchy humor and language that most Sailors and Marines would admire. It is definitely funny with a number of ""Oh, that's not right!"" type of scenes. However, unlike The Hangover [which I also like], there is a story to this that was pretty good - why the 10 is going for the 5, why the 5 thinks he isn't good enough, the unlikely story of a hot 10 with a scrawny 5, etc.It is definitely not for the kids / teens.For anybody who is curious, no, you aren't going to get to see Alice's Eve's awesome body in the buff. However, there is an underwear scene that will make the guys go ""Holy #&*%!!!!"""
4,"Funny, funny, funny!","This movie is a barrel of laughs. From beginning to end, there's always something to keep you interested and entertained."
5,Great melodic rock album!,These guys are a superb rock band. This album is filled with great songs from start to finish with absolutely no filler at all. The production is very big and the guitars sound cool. Great riffing from the guitarist. The highlight of the album is the amazing vocal lines and the brilliant delivery of them. The singer has nailed the power and the passion of the vocals and created some outstanding hooks. It really is a great album to listen to all the way through and really gets you rocking and fist pumping! Great driving music and highly recommended to fans of melodic rock like TNT (My religion) and Glenn Hughes.
2,Only OK,The battery I received doesn't seem to me to hold the charge nearly as long as the original. Bit of a disappointment.
4,Kelli's Review,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Normally I don't like reading books for class, I would rather pick out my own. But I'm so glad this book was chosen for us. It's a book about knowing that you can make it through anything. Mr. West did an excellent job of taking us on the trip with Donny. We truly felt all of the emotions with Donny and his siblings. He made me realize that even if I think I'm having a hard day there is always a positive thing out there. I would recommend this book to everyone that's looking to realize the positives in their own lives! Thanks Mrs. Sunde for choosing a great book!"
1,What on earth was this?,"A piece of crap, that's what it was. I can't believe even the scifi channel put out something this bad. Coming from me this is almost horrifying since I love scifi's B-rated bombers. I couldn't even laugh at this awful film because I couldn't even figure out what the hell was going on!"
5,Not a conventional 3 way,"If you have a 3 way system in place beware that you are not going to be able to use this with the standard setup, I completely eliminated one of the switches, but it wasn't needed anyway due to the motion sensing capabilities and perfect location of the main switch. I could re do the wiring and make it work if I bought another motion light like this but it would not really be worth it to me. Once you get the wiring figured out its installs and gets set up in 5 minutes. Just do your research and know the exact type of wiring you are installing into. Great product."
5,Great electric power saving product,This is a great product. Has good sensor coverage. I am using several of them especially on my big overhead fluorescent banks.
4,Good complete overview of service management basics,"Very easy reading, but deep enough to explain the principles of managing service. Concepts are backed up with numbers and research. The text includes the right number of stories, cases and quotes to make the ideas come alive. Covers many topics related to service management. Does not assume ""call center"" customer service as the domain in question. In short, a good guide to service management !"
1,Was This Tool Was Value Engineered Until It Failed?,I purchased this tool to punch additional holes in a belt that was too large.The belt was about 1/8 inch in thickness and made of harness leather. This machine lookedsturdy and well made but it could not completely penetrate the leather with hand pressure. Perhaps the dyes were dull or misaligned.I returned it this tool and found shoe repair shop to do the work.
4,Good Quality Tool!,"The main reason that I was looking for a leather punch was to add holes to my belt as I lost weight. This tool does a very good job, and has several size punches to choose from (interchangeable). It is also very well constructed.I had looked in a lot of stores, but could not find a suitable punch!I was wondering if replacement punches (inserts) are available in case one gets dull or damaged?"
2,Less than adequate,"The tool has one basic design fault which there is a needed reciprocal hole to accept the cutting device while piercing thru the belt. The receiving surface is flat so cutting clean is impossible unless you place something penetrable underneath the belt while attempting to use the tool. The word professional was my deciding factor because the tool is sturdy and feels durable but at the end of the day the result or execution falls miserably short. I will be taking my tool to a machine shop to see if they can bore a hole on the receiving end. Please beware most of these tools advertised have the same fault but I remembered seeing the one which understood the design required, maybe it was cheaper and I did not want to be ""penny wise and pound foolish"" but I still made the incorrect decision."
1,Bad... Bad...,"Awful. The tool arrived with the largest hole punch ready for use. I needed to change to smaller punch for several watches. It was simply IMPOSSIBLE to remove the punch from the tool. Tried everything. Gave up, returned it and bought another from Micro-tools directly. Don't bother."
2,"nice and heavy, but poorly machined","I bought this as many probably have to punch new holes through a couple of my old belts. The tool is nice and heavy, however the craftsmanship was less than desirable. In the end, it did exactly what I bought it for, but if you are looking for a tool that you will have with you for a long time... I would say you should buy something else. My major gripe with this tool was that the bits are all threaded to fit into the holder... however they are all slightly skewed, so that when you twist them in, they wobble. When they are fully in place, some of them didn't even have the tolerance to contact the bottom of the cutter, let alone contact it square."
4,Good enough for a single disc,"A compilation of SOME of the music featured in the great VH-1 special. I never gave the Go-Gos much credit back in the day, but that special made me take notice and realize the talent they have (a rare thing with most of those featured bands).Compared to ""Return to the Valley of the Go-Gos"", this disc is incomplete, but if you'd prefer to not pay for that double-cd package, get this one instead. With the addition of Cool Jerk and The Whole World Lost Its Head, this would be a perfect compilation."
3,Interesting,"Well, I read this many moons ago when I was little, and bought it just recently to read it again, trip down memory lane, ya know? I was surprised at how much I had forgotten. Mainly, what a '60s hippy screed this book is. The boy from another world learns English easily enough -because he is of a super-intelligent race, it seems- except for those words for which he has no concept to begin with: like money, police, profit, etc. Everyone apparently makes or grows everything they need with their own hands. O he is also strictly vegetarian, of course, and talks to the animals. It's almost startling how blatant it is as a propaganda piece. I would not go so far as to not recommend it, but I would treat the subject matter carefully with the impressionable reader, and use it as point of departure for discussing slightly more diverse viewpoints."
4,Kate is actually asked to investigate by the university,"Dr. Canfield Adams egotistical chair of the Islamic studies department is found dead on the pavement below his office window. The police see no reason to suspect foul play, but anyone who has met the man knows that he is the last person in the world to commit suicide. There are many suspects, but the police have locked in on the most unlikely, Kate's friend Humphrey Egereton. Adams resented the fact that Egereton's black students would use an office in his building for meetings. Kate is pressured into investigating by her friend in the administration, Edna, who tells Kate that she is the only one who can solve the matter discreetly.I found myself unable to put this book down. It was by far the quickest read of all Cross' novels. The story has many twists and turns and a surprise ending that I didn't expect at all."
3,ok,"It would be nice if they could update it to include things about ethanol, and better winterizing info. Good to have."
5,Violence Prevention program,"I have found The Quarreling Book to be a most effective story for 2nd and 3rd graders. To me, this book is not so much about quarreling, but more about emotions and feelings. This book is delightfully written by well-known children's author, Charlotte Zolotow with illustrations by Arnold Lobel. It really holds children's attention and helps them understand how we all ""pass on"" our feelings, for good or ill, to the people around us. In the classroom, I follow up with a discussion of specific strategies for emotionally healthy ways to deal with bad feelings. I would highly recommend this book to teachers and parents alike."
2,Adequate to Poor,I purchased these to replace some yellow stakes that broke from our tent. The quality of the original stakes from my tent are adequate to good. But these stakes are of a LOWER quality. I would rate them adequate to poor.
3,technical book,"This book is full of technical information and a ton of facts. I was disapointed though that the photos were all paperback black and white, even though it is hardback. So buy this book for facts not photos."
1,Demons Triple Feature,"I didn't like any of these movies, specially with Demons III: The Ogre, the first two were great movies. But this one I really hate it."
4,Good detail on less traveled Southern locations,"Last year I took the Rough Guide to Thailand and this year I am taking the latest edition of Lonely Planet. Already I can see a significant difference in the level of detail regarding smaller towns and islands. I especially like the attention to email access, as it's difficult to stay in touch without it. No guide is perfect, but the supplemental information about the status of recovery from the Dec. 2004 tsunami and policy changes under the current government help compensate for the frequent sales pitches for companion books from the large Lonely Planet library.If it's possible to update this review after I get back, I will!"
3,Past Life Regression,"The CD is short with stories of past life regression experiences and how it changed their lives. I listened to the actual regression piece, but have not been able to do it yet."""
2,How are these reviews so varied,"These sheets were never soft even after washing maybe 5 times. Also faded and spotty after one washing, Smokey blue faded to a peachy color; especially on the pillow cases. Feels like a very fine sandpaper to the skin; like they are heavily starched or something. Definitely not what I expected since these are supposed to be 100% egyptian cotton with singly-ply yarns. Some reviews say they are the softest sheets ever. It's almost as if there are two different sets of sheets being sent out! On the plus side they did seem to be a good thickness and looked very nice out of the package (although they wrinkled very badly after washing)."
5,Great value!,I was kind of sceptic getting such a lower price on califonia king sheets. I did have to wash them 3 times before they felt soft. But now they are great! Feel soft and fit perfectly. Definitely worth the price. And Amazon is amazing - getting them out so quickly!
1,"Worst sheets, do not buy",These sheets are extremely rough. I would not pay even $30 for them. The color is nice but I have washed them 2 times and they still feel horrible.
3,"Decent sheet set, some issues.","Pros:1) They fit my mattress + foam topper great.2) They're clearly high quality.3) They're nice and thick.Cons:1) The eggshell color has a slight green tinge to it. It's barely perceptible, but I notice it against all of my other stuff that's off-white.2) Perhaps because they're high thread-count, they have a slippery feel to them that I don't like. If I sweat at all at night, they feel almost sticky.3) They wrinkle like crazy, even if I put them on the bed right out of the dryer."
4,sheets that fit,"Too often I find myself stretching and pulling on fitted sheets to get all four corners over and under the matress--not with these, the fitted sheet fits perfectly. The flat sheet allows plenty of material all the way around for a wonderful fit. Beyond functionality, they are soft and feel great."
2,"Low quality, not comfortable :(","I was really unhappy with this purchase. Really surprising given 500+ reviews and 5 star rating. Bottomline is these sheets are thick, rough, and not comfortable. I'd recommend spending less for something similar, or spending more for something nicer."
5,one of the best sheet sets EVER!,"Was so happy with this sheet set.. So soft and comfy. Fits my mattress better than any I've ever had. I'm a senior person and have arthritis and fibromyalgia. Turning all nite long can be a challenge but with these sheets, I'm like a fish in water!"
2,"scratchy, I miss things made in the USA","I miss so many things made in the USA, these sheets this like everything else I buy is not the quality we enjoyed and took for granted. Scratchy sheets.."
1,Worst night's sleep ever!,"Holy mother of itch! I received these luxurious sheets yesterday. Made the bed with them and when bedtime came, I slid into what seemed like a bed of burlap. Like I'd washed the sheets with the cat.I went back to the product description to read between the comments that rated these sheets 5 stars. I see others who rated them 1 star. Those people also mentioned that a number of washings even with fabric softener did not make this set any softer. Back they go.I am not sure if it's because I ordered the chestnut... maybe it was the dye... not sure... but I will be returning them as defective and not reordering this brand."
3,Not very soft and color off,"These sheets aren't very soft, and I wouldn't call the color mint. It is more like sage."
1,"You could die, waiting for these sheets to come...","It's funny how amazon describes these sheets as an ""amazon exclusive."" That must not be saying much because it's not that the sheets are sold out - it's just that they're never in stock in the first place.I ordered these sheets in April and got the 4-to-6 week waiting period. Okay, fine. But the six weeks are up, and here comes the email with ""they're out of stock."" Ya think?But the best part is that they've now upped the delivery to freaking SEPTEMBER! Five months for sheets? What are they doing, spinning them by hand?I'd love to get these sheets to see what they're like, but it's pretty clear that's never going to happen. I don't know what's with Amazon lately. They used to be fantastic with delivery and customer service.Nothing stays the same (and in this case, that's a crying shame.)"
1,Description is not accurate,"I can't attest to the quality because I didn't use them. The reason I bought them is because they said they were Made in Portugal. I was looking for something not made in China. Well, lo and behold, it gets here and there is a sticker on it that says ""Made in China."""
1,Do not order,"I order Egyptian cotton sheets because my skin is very sensitive.These sheets are no more Egyptian cotton than I am.The ones I ordered are useless. They were very stiff from sizing and the smell was extremely strong. Thinking that was the reason they weren't soft, I washed them twice. They never softened up. The sizing is still there, less, but still there. It gives the sheets the feel of being not clean, so of course they aren't soft. The smell isn't as strong but also is still there. I would never buy these sheets again. If it was possible to give minus stars.....I would have."
4,Great sheets,"These sheets are very comfortable and soft. They are a little on the warm side in the summer - probably due to the thread count. I love how they feel. Also, the price is very reasonable given the size of the sheets. I will order these again."
4,"Warm, soft sheets","These are the first sheets I have ever purchased with the ""Egyptian cotton"" material, and I must say, I was pleased. They are warm and perfect for the winter, but can be a little hot in warmer seasons. Also very durable, and increasingly comfy after each wash. Great sheets for their price."
2,doesn't fit well,"The fitted sheet is too small for my queen size mattress. It's not the depth that's the issue, I don't have a deep mattress. The problem is that the corners on the fitted sheet is too close together, so that the rectangle formed by the four corners are smaller than the queen size mattress. It's impossible to get the fitted sheet on the mattress properly.The sheets are also not soft. They are a bit stiff even after several washes. Overall, I don't think these sheets are worth the price tag."
5,SO SOFT!,"These sheets are amazing! They're very soft and a nice weight. They did take FOREVER to arrive, but they were worth it!"
3,These are sheets,Yes they are slightly course coming out of the wash for the first time. I don't really care. I'm a college student and I don't even use the top sheet that comes with this set. You guys are too picky.
1,"shipping date kept getting extended, ending up cancelling","I placed the order for these sheets on January 16th, almost 2 months ago. They notified me later that it wouldn't ship until March 8th. Then they notify me on March 7 that it won't ship until April 9. And it said it was in stock when i placed the order - totally wasted my time selecting and anticipating the arrival of these new sheets. Anyway, you can get decent enough sheets at Ross or Nordstrom Rack for cheaper."
3,Great but warmer than I thought they would be,"I think these sheets are great, very soft and comfortable, the only drawback I think is that they are warmer than I thought they would be. Almost like flannel sheets are warm, even when you crawl into them at night they are warm."
4,Nice sheets so far,"I still can't get used to the wrinkling of these Egyptian Cotton sheets. I don't like to iron but these are pretty bad when they come out of the dryer. They sleep well, no piling after 4 washings. I would probably purchase these again."
4,soft sheets,"I was concerned that some reviews stated sheets were not soft in the begining. We found these sheets soft from day one, the fit is amazing and I love that they STAY on my bed, as many seem to work their way off our mattress during the night. Nice sheets, worth the price."
3,Pinzon 400 thread count sheets,"I have three sets of these sheets, purchased less than a year ago. Yesterday, I spent the afternoon replacing the elastic around all three of the fitted bottom sheets. The original elastic was so stretched that it was like string...no give whatsoever. I only use them six months of the year because we spend our winters in Florida. Last year I bought them for Florida as well and will no doubt have to replace the elastic in those as well. Otherwise I really like the quality of the cotton and the way they feel. Given the fact that the sheets are of such good quality, better quality elastic should be used. I will not be purchasing any more of Pinzon bedding.I purchased all of these sheets from Amazon"
1,Very disappointing,"I got these sheets after reading 5 star reviews, and when I received them I was not happy. They were scratchy, and uncomfortable. I couldn't even sleep one night on them. Hopefully I can get my money back, these sheets were not worth $60! It's a shame because they looked gorgeous on my bed, that was their only pro."
5,excellent value,this set of bed linens was excellent; the value was much greater than i paid; i highly recommend this product and price.
2,Scratchy,"The sheets are thick and pretty much as described. But after washing them once before use, they're scratchy; I think I'd even describe them as borderline prickly when I just lie flat on them without even moving. Not the quality I expected. They also wrinkle a lot, but I expected that given the material and don't hold it against them."
3,Good quality but not worth the price.,It's comfy and clean. It is better to pay more for quality and this is not bad. The price is a little too much if you compare to other brands and qualities. It does the job but for what it's worth and bed bath and beyond seem to have better quality with the same price or less. Its great for ending up at your front door!!!
4,nice sheets,"The sheets are good, have no problems, no piling and overall a good purchase. However does not compare to 1000 thread count, but I mean who would expect that?"
1,NOT SOFT AT ALL,"I ordered these because of the ""rave reviews"" and washed them before I used them. These sheets are rough and not soft at all.. I've paid a lot less for better quality. Maybe it has something to do with the color like someone else stated I ordered the white.."
4,Simple and Nice,"I'm not very well educated in the matter of sheets so I wasn't sure what to expect out of 400 thread count sheets. These are not impressively soft, they actually have a little bit of a silky texture but I didn't find that to be a bad quality. They're still an absorbant cotton and I sleep comfortably on them and they wash well. My main complaints would have to be that the sheets seem to be a bit larger than full size. I have a standard full size bed but I had to tuck the sheets in quite far under the mattress. Also, the pictures makes the sheets look almost a light blue color but they are very gray blue."
4,Great Sheets.. Great Value,I bought these as a replacement for the single flat sheet I accidentally bought for pretty much the same price! I love these sheets.. soft and a pretty smokey blue color. They fit well on my pillow top mattress and are really comfortable. Love smooth clean feeling sheets!
5,great shets,"I was looking for some nicer sheets for out bed, these have worked out great. They are a tad bit scratchy out of box, they age great after about the 2nd wash. They are a bit tight on on the sides (queen) but there is enough fabric on the top to keep it from stretching too tight and putting stress on the fabric. Over all i would recommend these sheets and plan on buying more myself."
3,Disappointing,Disappointed. Not as soft as you would think for the thread count. Followed directions for washing. Sheets were horribly wrinkled just out of dryer cycle. Washed again cold water and rinse and stood at dryer to removed before too dry and still horribly wrinkled
2,Not soft!,"I love a good nights sleep in soft luxurious linens. Do not buy these if that is what you are looking for! These sheets are not soft! Against my skin they feel rough and a bit scratchy. These would be fine for a guest bedroom, but I would not recommend them for your daily use."
1,save your money!,"These sheets are the most comfortable soft, silky,cool & luxurious sheets at first! but after a few washings they have developed rips/holes all over, like big moth holes, the fabric is sub par obviously, washed in cool water on delicate and now they look like swiss cheese!and are good for cleaning rags only, the pillow cases and sheets are covered in these 1"" holes. they are stored with other linens that have no holes, so it is not due to a moth problem.I cannot not recommend them."
4,Can't Go Wrong.,"I was pleasently surprised with the high quality of the sheets. They are heavy but soft. After laundering them, the top hem and pillow case ends did not wrinkle up like some do."
1,Did not live up to reviews,"After reading the product information and reviews on these sheets, believed they would be soft and welcoming for sleep and a good buy. The material felt stiff out of the package but thought that might be due to sizing and that it would relax after washing. No such luck as it is just as stiff after washing and now wrinkled as well. Look elsewhere!"
5,Top Quality Sheets,I bought the plum colored sheets awhile back and was very impressed with them. They are very high quality and fit my thick mattress really well and the color is lovely. No pilling after several washings and they are very soft and luxurious. I have now purchased a second set in another color because I dont think I cant find this quality anywhere else for this price.
1,Scratchy & wrinkly,"I'm hoping that if I wash these sheets to death, they will soften up. So far I've washed them twice with both fabric softener and dryer sheets and they are the scratchiest sheets I own. These are the only ""luxury"" sheets I own, and they are worse than all my others which are standard sheets. They are also wrinkly straight out of the dryer.... which I don't really care about but just be aware. Look elsewhere!"
2,NOT smooth-sleeping,"Although the sizing is generous and I liked the blush color, these sheets are a disappointment. Once the sizing washed out they became rough in texture; I've slept on smoother muislin. Despite the claims of being silky smooth, I did not find these sheets to be comfortable."
2,Not for the faint of heart,"I would not buy these again. Unfortunately, they were not soft in the slightest and have remained, despite multiple washings very institutional in feel. If you are looking for soft and comfortable sheets I suggest you look further."
4,Thick well made but not very smooth,"Good quality fabric and construction. Fits well on the bed even with a 12 inch mattress. I would suggest it to friends--the only downside is the fabric, although a good thickness, is a little rough."
2,go for the higher count,I've gotten other 400 count sheet sets (Royal Velvet) and they are ot nearly as scratchy as these. Hate them. Washed them twice before using them. Used fabric softener- still like sandpaper. Color is darker than shown. And they wrinkle! sick of ironing sheets! Very disappointed...wondering if bleach will help the color and break down the fibers enough to make them soft...otherwise I'll only use them when the hubby is in the doghouse and I'm sleeping on the couch!
3,Just So-So,"I appreciate that the fabric is substantial but they're not as soft as I would like. The fabric is a bit coarse for my preference. I've washed numerous times and have used softener sheets, which has helped, but only somewhat."
3,Not as soft as expected,I was looking for a new pair of sheets that were very soft. After reading the reviews these sounded like a good buy. After receiving them I through them in the wash. I was surprised when they actually felt rougher after washing them. These sheets are ok but definitely nothing I would highly recommend.
2,Itchy!,I have now washed these sheets twice with fabric softener and they are still itchy. Maybe if I iron them. They do keep their sateen sheen after washing. The sheets fit well and I have a deep mattress and foam topper. The material is of good weight. I just hope they will soften and become comfortable with more washing.
5,It gets better after wash.,It gest softer after wash. We love it. It is not too think. I ordered another set in egg shell color which comes in today. Hope the quality is consistent.
1,"Comfortable, but easily stained","These sheets are nice to sleep on I guess, but after two months the ""smokey blue"" has turned to pink in several places. As far as I know, I don't sweat more than average, and this isn't an issue I've had with other sheets. Perhaps other colors are better dyed, but I would recommend avoiding these."
3,Wrinkle badly when washed,"The sateen finish is nice, and the stitching is well done; however, the sheets and pillow cases need ironing even when pulled directly from the dryer. The quality of the sheets is nice if you don't mind ironing."
1,Waste of Money,"After reading the other review I thought these would be great, but I was wrong. These are the worst sheet I have ever bought. They are stiff and scratchy and no matter how much fabric softener I used it never helped. They also do not breathe & the top sheet for the king size was way too long and almost touched the floor at the bottom of the bed, like it was for a cali king. I had to go out and buy another set, which was cheaper and much better. I wish I would have returned these, but too late now. Never buying bedding online again."
5,top of the line,best purchase I ever made. these are by far the best.perfect fit for extra deep mattress.
4,very nice,Very soft after the second washing but not as strong as the first set that I ordered. the top sheet is longer than Ir it would like for it to be
2,Quality material but not soft,"I ordered this product expecting to receive soft, luxurious sheets. The sheets that came are rough and scratchy. I washed them 5-6 times with minimal improvement. I tried everything from soaking to using white vinegar.A positive is that the sheets are durable and seem to be made with quality fabric. The negative is that they are not soft as stated in the product description.Continuous washing of the sheets will probably soften them up over time, but I'd rather not have to run my sheets through the wash 40 times to get my desired softness.I will be returning the sheets.EDIT: Amazon processed my refund for the full amount on the same day I dropped the package off at UPS! 2 stars for the sheets but 5 stars for Amazon!"
1,Not Wrinkle Free,"I was looking for sheets to replace a set that always had wrinkles. Was hoping this set would do it; but, alas, these weren't the answer. After washing and drying (on a wrinkle free dryer setting) twice, these have the same wadded up look as the others. I thought I did enough research on material quality and thread count to find a good quality sheet, but I guess I need to know more."
3,Not the softness I was hoping for,"After searching for good, inexpensive sheets for quite some time, I settled on these because of multiple reviews of them being really soft. Maybe its an inconsistency in the fabric, but my set is anything but soft. They are a little rough and almost scratchy, even after washing them and needless to say, I am pretty disappointed. What I can say is that they are thick, the stitching seems to be pretty durable so I feel like they will last a long time. The fabric has the shine to them that is expected from a sateen stitch, however, they get very wrinkled. If this is something that bothers you, you will probably need to take them out of the dyer immediately and either fold them or put them back on the bed.Overall, for the price point, they seem durable but I gave them 3 stars because the softness is nonexistent with my set."
4,Good for the price,"The sheets were definitely worth the price, which is much cheaper than all the physical stores I visited, but they weren't as soft as I expected. Perhaps they will get softer with washes, as some have suggested. Also, I am used to combed cotton, which has a much different feel.One thing I liked that I didn't know from the description is that they were taller than my other sheet sets - meaning they fit around my mattress and the foam pads easily, so the fitted sheet doesn't pop off the corners of my mattress when I move around in my sleep."
5,THE BEST CD YOU CAN BUY FOR UNDER A DOLLAR !,"I CAME ACROSS THIS CD WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A BARGIN AT A USED CD STORE....I DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH OF A BARGIN IT WAS UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF PLAYING IT ABOUT 10 TIMES...I HAD JUST GOT NEW SPEAKERS IN MY CAR AND WANTED A GOOD CD TO TEST THEM OUT ON...THIS WAS IT. THIS CD HAS GREAT PRODUCTION. THE ARTIST ..SHONA ,IS A GREAT SINGER WITH THE PERFECT VOICE AND A REALLY GOOD SONGWRITER.IT IS A SHAME SHE DOES NOT GET MORE POPULAR ? I SINCE HAVE PURCHASED HER OTHER 2 CDS , AND THEY ARE GREAT AS WELL.THIS CD GOT ME THROUGH SOMR TUFF TIMES ... I HAD JUST LOST MY GIRLFRIEND..( CAR ACCIDENT ) SHONA , IF YOU ARE READING THIS OUT THERE..I LOVE YOU AND YOUR MUSIC..ANY FAN A GREAT SOLID SONGWRITING GET THIS CD.!!!!!LM."
4,Perfect for Holiday Parties,I think this is the perfect dvd to have on during your holiday parties. It creates a really pretty background and invites conversation.The video shows the fire being lit and tended to. It's an easy way to warm up any get together.
5,Reminiscent of Melissa Banks,"A truly beautiful, moving collection of short stories. Although the style is very different, this book reminded me a lot of The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing in the way in which the stories just pull you in and make you care about the characters. She captures the voices of so many different characters perfectly, and I couldn't put it down."
2,great title...,"I wish the book lived up to the great title, don't know what I was seduced by when I bought this one, but it is a general waste of time.Shallow, quick, cool, emotionless, not what I expected from the reviews, alas.Sorry I bought it, there are so many books, so little time, and this one you can pass on despite the hype."
5,Addictively funkaholic,"Great, refreshing and original funky metal.The basslines are incredibly groovy and the hole sound is tight. Special emphasis to the the coverversion of Led Zepplin's 'Immigrant song'. Never heard such a witty interpretation."
3,so and so,"Alright, let me be honest, they could do better. I love the corrs they have angelic voices but the album only had 3 good songs. The first album i absolutly loved! Every song on it was wonderful. But on this cd and the songs almost sounded the same, im sure they could do much better. I don't reccomend getting the cd, get a single. If you liked the song breathless and are not sure if you want to get their cd get Talk On Corners, that cd you'll love!"
4,"nice pop music, nice sound",I knew nothing about the Corrs when I bought this (it's for testing DVD-Audio). The tunes are very pleasant and there's a nice variety. The recording uses 5.1 but not ridiculously. If you're a Corrs fan you'll love this new mix; if you're not it's still a good demo.
5,One of the best bands!!!!,"This cd is awesome, it is one of those that you can play over and over again wihout getting tired of it, The Corrs have talent and they are really good artists with very great voices, they are one of my favorite bands of all time. I highly recommend this cd to anyone thats looking for some good feel music to listen to, you won't be disappointed. I give this one and their other albums A++++++!!!!!!! I have alots of favorites on this cd especially Breathless. The Corrs rock!!!!!!"
2,The Corrs have sold out and lost their uniqueness,"When I first heard the Corrs ""Forgiven not Forgotten"" (first album), I fell in love. Their unique blend of pop with traditional Irish elements was marvelous. The second album ""Talk on Corners"" was definitely good, but it had lost some of that Irish flavour. I was mildly disappointed. I actually skip over a couple songs on that cd. When I heard ""Breathless"" on the radio, I literally felt ill! It is the worst of 80's pop all over again! (And that was never good to begin with!) There was nothing unique or special about it. In short, The Corrs, capitalising on their amazing physical beauty and musical talent, have SOLD OUT. :*( Very sad, imho."
2,Nauseatingly syrupy.,"The ""filler"" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from ""Rebel Heart"" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all!"
2,Average at Best,"The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others."
4,Great pop with incredible vocal harmonies...,"Normally my music preferences are hard rock/metal(child of the late 70's and 80's), but I really like this album. I came across it in a used bin and decided to take a chance on it because I liked the single Breathless, I'm glad I did. The Songs are simple pop songs with great melodies and the Irish influence that is mixed in definitely adds to the music. The standout feature, to me, are the vocal harmonies. Andrea Corr has a beautiful voice, and the harmonies provided by the rest of the Corrs are perfect. The production on the album was provided by Mutt Lange, so you know it's pristine in it's quality.Song Highlights include: Breathless, Give Me A Reason, All The Love In The World, Radio, No More Cry and Rebel Heart(a cool instrumental).This is pop music with the added bonus that the band has a great deal of musical talent, which makes it stand out(at least to me). If you like simple pop songs you will like In Blue."
4,Tanya Dreyser,"Great Group! Excellent voices, as we well as their vocal arrangements and the band behind them, all this really indicates a real talent and versatility."
2,Mutt purged the Irish from the Corrs,"As a follow to their wonderful first two records, this is a big disappointment. The distinctive blend of Celtic traditional music and catchy pop is gone. I hope they go back to their roots the next time around."
4,In Blue,"On their third album, we find the Corrs going for a more contemporary pop sound. The result is a well rounded effort with memorable pop tunes. Chances are in 2000 you could not escape the hit ""Breathless"", with it's catchy chorus and infectuous melody, how could you not sing along? ""Radio"" is a great song too that is very memorable. ""All The Love In The World"" is a nice ballad, as is ""Somebody for Someone"". Other highlights include ""Irresistible"", ""Rebel Heart"", ""Give Me A Reason"", and more. Overall a strong album start to finish!"
2,Previous albums were far better...,"A new CD by the Corrs? I *ran* to the stores to buy it, and was totally disappointed. This is a pop album. There is almost nothing left of the beautiful Irish folk themes, which you can find on ""Forgiven, Not Forgotten"" and ""Talk on Corners"". If it weren't for the last instrumental track, it would sound like another Spice Girls album..."
2,disappointed with corrs,I have the corrs other two ablbums Forgiven and Talk on corners and felt they were better than this one. I liked the mix of irish melodies and vocals on those two albums. On this album they seem to stray away from this formula. The only songs I liked on this album were breathless and rebel heart. They had the flavor of their other two albums but the other songs didn't quite catch that. I am sure they wanted to expand their music but I hope they go back to what Forgiven and Talk on corners had. I listen to them all the time. Here is for hoping.
2,product unsatisfactory,i didnt receive the whole volume and the return was good but not the replacement i still didnt receive all the movies.
5,practical transformation,I found this to be one of the best practical transformational books I have found in thrity years thanks you
3,Some interesting info but too wordy with filler,"A quirky self-help book for those wishing to enhance or improve the work of the heart. The authors have some oddly-named procedures to help, which do seem practical and practicable. It's a bit repetitive and verbose, however."
4,Heartmath solotion,"Reading this book slow will give you a deep understanding of how our bodies work, this book is a must have book."
5,I heartily recommend - Pun Intended,"The Heartmath Solution outlines the important role that our hearts play in our emotional lives, especially with regard to stress, anger, and anxiety. The Heartmath Solution is several exercises that use the heart, not the head, as the key to controlling emotional wellbeing, both for acute and chronic emotional situations.The science behind the theory is well documented and quite compelling, and the techniques are easy to learn and practice. Do yourself a big favor and BUY THIS BOOK, then buy several copies for friends and family, like I did."
4,This guy's 11?,"As a native New Orleanian I've been blessed to follow Harry's career in person and on CD. (Did you know that Harry Connick, Sr. is the District Attorney of New Orleans and has a CD of his own?)This is a phenomenal compilation of classic jazz for a young man who's talent is incredible even at age 11. Muskrat Ramble is perhaps my favorite classic jazz tune and Harry delivers with musical talent beyond his years.I don't know how else to critique this kid except to say that tracks one through nine are no less wonderful than musicians far older and more established. Age aside, this a complete work of classic jazz art."
2,I was unimpressed,"Ministry of Sound's Annual 2006 left me with an emtpy feeling after listening to it. It's just OK, not great. The song selection seems to be lacking. There's not a whole lot of standouts there, unlike 2005's version which I enjoyed a lot. A lot of the songs start sounding too much alike and the vocalists all start sounding like the same person after awhile.That said, it's nice that you get over 2 hours of music for a reasonable price. It's just sometimes I wonder if there's enough material to really fill up two entire discs, or if they'd have been better off pulling the 12 best songs and putting it onto one disc.Normally the Ministry of Sound name would guarantee a good CD, but this one is just lacking that special something. It didn't make me want to listen to it again. I'm very unimpressed."
5,LOVE IT,"This product is great. Not only does it make me laugh, but it is also convinient if you want to keep a record of when you breastfeed or poopies and pees, or also your baby's randomness or firsts. I use it as a little diary for my little girl. I would recommend this product to others."
5,Probably THE Most Important Book I Have Ever Read,I've read the book no less than ten times. I have given the book as a gift no less than twenty times. I have watched the DVD no less than five times. Each and every hour that I have spent with this wonderful book has brought on further enlightenment and empowerment.When I heed Campbell's words; I stay on my path and follow my bliss. Thereby creating that which is intended for me.Campbell does a tremendous job relating my world to that of the ancients. He crosses cultures and history with aplumb. Leaving the reader completely aware that all is connected and we have a role to play as creator.
3,Read and make your own decision,"Let me quote Campbell. Towards the end of the second chapter: ""People ask me, 'Do you have optimism about the world?' And I say, 'Yes, it's great just the way it is. And you are not going to fix it up. Nobody has ever made it any better. It is never going to be any better. This is it, so take it or leave it. You are not going to correct or improve it."" I continued reading, waiting for a valid explanation for this, but to no avail. Campbell makes you think, I'll give him that much. I suggest that you make your own verdict."
5,"E pluribus, unum","Campbell's ""The Power of Myth"" is a series of transcriptions of his conversations with Bill Moyers of PBS. As scholar of mythology, Cambell has both a deep and broad understanding of the countless myths that have been told over the ages - and the handful of messages that they convey. Weaving threads through such arcane and seeming unrelated topics such as Native American, Egyptian, Hindu, and Greek mythology, James Joyce, medieval romance, Star Wars, and the back side of a one-dollar bill, Cambell displays an intense passion for distilling away the metaphors that differentiate the multitude of myths, and finding the few gems that lie at the heart of them all. Absolutely an excellent book.The illustrations in this edition are beautiful and fascinating, but one could question whether they were worth the extra price. I found this version to be worth the investment."
2,Warning,Kindle Edition has no pictures. extra words extra words extra words extra words extra words extra words extra words extra words
5,A surprisingly very good vocal CD.,"From Dietrich's 30's movies, you wouldn't expect her to sing as well as she does on this CD, compiled from her 50's studio sessions for Columbia. Informitive liner notes by author of ""Jazz Singing"" Will Friedwald, are a definite plus, and lot's of glamorous photos inside. Dietrich sounds best singing in german, highlights are German versions of American jazz standards ""Time On My Hands,"" ""Surrey With The Fringe On Top,"" and ""Lili Marlene."" Another gem is the duet with young Rosemary Clooney ""Good For Nothing."" And in English Dietrich sings the difinitive version of ""No Love, No Nothin'"" If you want sultry vocals, and want to hear the under-rated Dietrich really sing, try this CD, she might shock you with her vocal abilities, on this CD she really can sing, and very well. Don't judge her as a vocalist till you've heard this. Recommended"
1,There Is A Massive Problem With This Disk That You Should Know About,"This is a great disk, but I am surprised nobody has caught this;The disk is formatted improperly- the songs listed don't match the actual song order. The actual correct order is-1. Lili Marlene2. Mean To Me3. Annie Doesn't Live Here Anymore4. The Surrey With The Fringe On Top5. Time On My Hands6. Taking A Chance On Love7. Miss Otis Regrets8. I Never Slept A Wink Last Night9. Peter, Peter, Komm Zu Mir Zurueck10. Come Rain Or Come Shine11. A Guy What Takes His Time12. Good For Nothing (duet with Rosemary Clooney)13. Falling In Love Again14. La Vie En Rose15. No Love, No Nothin'16. Something I Dreamed Last Night17. Let's Call It A Day18. Lili MarleneCheck it out in the listening section if you remain skeptical. You don't have to speak German (or French) either, the songs in English at the end of the disk demonstrate this as well."
2,Baby Name Countdown,"This book was kind of disappointing because it only listed names without giving many descriptions, meanings or alternate spellings. It did however, give popular name lists for different areas of the country as well as ranks for previous decades. It does contain A LOT of names, but they are only in list form with nothing of use to help in deciding if a particular name would be good for you. I would prefer a book with more substance even if this one did have more names than any others I've found."
1,Harlequin Collector;s Set,The first two movies are the same I just diden't care for it I diden't even watch the hole thing
3,"A Quick ""Shock and Awe"" raid on the VP","While I share many of the same critiques of teh Vice President as the author (although not all) this book really lacks some depth. It makes valid points about the vice president but thet are shallowly presented.However, with that said, the book does ofer a good look at a very important figure who has managed to escape much scruitiny. Additionally, the book does give a national audience its first look at some of the lesser known problems with the VP."
5,Why not dream?,"Gives you pros and cons, It has Been a dream, but I think I will just continue to visit. Enjoyed book though."
3,Pretty but not built as nice as some others,"This is a beautiful stuffed animal but the quality of the feet construction is not good. I read this in some other reviews before ordering but had already bought three of the other animals and thought it would just be a matter of adjusting the toy. Not so. It is a quality of construction issue. This toy is not made as well as the giraffe, white tiger and elephant I have already purchased. I would pass on this if I had seen it in a store."
4,Life-like Cheetah,This is really cool. Good price and well done -- is pretty realistic and good value for the money. Good bang for the buck.
5,Huge Cheetah,"When i received the cheetah i unwrapped it and couldn't believe how huge it was. it looks very real, and is HUGE. i never seen such a realistic and life-size animal like that before. it's cool for that price. I do however wish this company would stop changing their price every few hours. when i went to buy it, it was $37.49 with $2.99 for shipping. when i went to order it it was $46.66 with $8.99 for shipping, and it just kept going up and down ALL day. then they 'claimed"" that it was never that price. Then they say ""just 1 left in stock"" when they know there were more. It's a great product it shipped quickley and came in perfect shape, but they need to keep a price and stop."
1,House of seven gables,It would not play in dvd player! THAT SUCKS!!We had to watch it on the small screen of my computer.
4,dust cup,"meant all my expectations. the product was represented well and was exactly what they said it is. i would buy it again,"
1,Boring compared to the Off-Broadway version by Lippa,Don't buy this... try Lippa's adaptation of the same poem. I can't believe that this is more popular.
5,I Always Wanted To See The Lights Of Broadway,"I was stunned that this Tony nominated musical did not win any awards. First of all, this play has sex, booze, fabulous actors, and lovely music. Second of all; it was probably one of the most original musicals of this year. The score is wonderful. If you love music from the twenties, then you would absolutely die for The Wild Party. The music is very original, and it sounds like actual music from the decade, not just words. Just listening to this cd gives you the goosebumps. I would definatly recommend this cd to any theater lover, and even to people that aren't."
1,useless,"This book assumes you already know how to code in lingo. I am experienced in using Director but don't know anything about lingo. It has a verry small appendix that hardly explanes what the code does. You can however read the code frome the games it includes but that is the hardest way to learn. If you already are familiar with lingo, then you don't even need this book. The book says ""to get this effect, type in this code.."" but it doesn't say why. It says if you need to know why, look up the lingo in the appendix. Problem is, only one or two words in that whole code you just typed are in the apendix. This boolk made me more confused than ever."
1,Looks LIke a Copy,"French film industry like the U.S. (with the exception of some CGI studios) is, relative to other parts of the world e.g. Argentina, Vietnam, China, Japan, on the creative decline. The writers were so uninspired that some scenes look as if they were taken straight out of 28 Days/Weeks and various other ""... Dead"" flicks.One day it's a normal world then the very next day we suddenly have the cheap ""city-on-fire"" green screen as well as dead people by the thousands suddenly become running dead - all without explanation. It's the usual predictable movie for fast food mentality meat eaters - cheap blood.In summary: The story makes no sense and goes nowhere and is as predictable as French taxes. You start out with six or so and, guess what, you end up with one just standing around - as usual."
5,Classic Case,"I wanted a classic Case knife just like my grandfather carried. It's wonderfully old school, no locking mechanism, beautifully made and of course, made in the USA! I'm not sure how much longer ""USA"" made knives will be available so buy one soon! I ordered one and I couldn't bring myself to touch it bare handed. So, I ordered another which I can carry. I ordered the custom made sheath for ""The CaseTrapper"", and its a perfect match. These knives will last me for years and I hope they get past down to my grandchildren."
5,Come meet Pearl!,"This installment does have Paul back, lots of action, and a great woods scene in the end. But more importantly, you get to meet Pearl, the Wonder dog!Actually this Speenser novel is one of the better ones. I've gone back and re-read it many times. Highly recomended."
3,Not Too Good,"Parker is at it again . . . this time with old character Paul Giacom. Spenser is helping Paul find his trashy, worthless mother. . . why they bother is inexplicable at first. Then Parker explains . . .Paul is thinking of getting married, and needs to understand his mother's worthlessness before committing himself to his girlfriend. In the end, it is explained that Paul went home and is now acting distant with his girlfriend. Parker sure is making the case for all the men in his Spenser series being in the closet."
5,GREAT!!! I LOVE it!!,"Celtic Thunder has to be my favorite celtic concert DVD ever! I especially like the variety in the voices of the five singers. You have Damian who brings youthful exuberance, Keith who has charm, Ryan who is mysterious, Paul who is sentimental, and George who has such a traditional celtic sound. I first saw this show on PBS and immediately ordered it as well as the cds. I have probably watched it a hundred times and still can't get enough of it. I do have a question though. Can anybody tell me what kind of earring Keith has and where could I get one?"
3,Celtic Thunder show,Celtic Thunder: The ShowAMAZING -- FUN -- ENJOYABLE AND A MUST SEE!!!!Don't miss Ryan Kelly and Damian McGinty - all five guys blow you away
2,Not worth the price,I can't say that I've been impressed with any of their performances or CD releases. Probably not going to buy any more of their products. I'm very disappointed with this group.
4,great DVD,"The concert of course is fantastic with some extra songs that weren't shown when it aired on TV. The sound is a bit wonky, but otherwise good purchase"
1,Celtic Thunder,"The DVD was blank. Unfortunately I do not have the receipt, therefore, I could not return it."
5,Celtic Thunder,"We have watched Celtic Thunder several times in the two weeks since we purchased it on Amazon.com. It's fantastic - what voices these young men have. I love Damien McGinty and can't believe a boy of 14 could have such a mature voice and what personality he exhibits. One of my favorites is his ""Puppy Love."" Buy it and you will be GLAD."
4,"Very nice, probably prefer the CD, though","I DVR'd(or TIVO'd) this last night. Had to watch it first thing this morning. May have been the PBS station(not the best for my area), but it looked a bit like some pre-recorded voices were going on in a few places. I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if I could - yeah, it's good. Like they say - it's not a ""boy band"", but 5 talented individuals. A good blend of fun songs & moving songs - just wish the station hadn't been interrupting through the show, but I understand about raising money. If they come to Chattanooga(like Celtic Woman did), I'll be there."
5,Wonderful entertainment,"This is the most enjoyable DVD that I have ever purchased. The voices blend so well and the solos are terrific. One of the things that I want to comment on is the respect that the performers all displayed for one another, such graciousness. Wonderful music. so much so that I bought four of their other DVDs and love them all."
2,Kilts a Celtic group doth not make,"If you're looking for the male version of Celtic Woman, look elsewhere! This is more like an Irish pop group than anything else. They sing a few ""Celtic"" songs (Ireland's Call, Homeland, The Mountains of Mourne, Come by the Hills), which are admittedly very good, but the rest is a plug for composer Phil Coulter's ""original work,"" which is rather poor. Overall I was very disappointed."
4,Has its moments,"If you can ignore the horrendous choreography (who told these guys to move this way???)and just focus on the music, you can really enjoy this. They all have great voices, they harmonize beautifully, most of the song choices are good (this show is heavy on the romance, truly a chic show, and they're all good-looking). Best to just buy the CD, though, because actually watching them perform leaves you constantly shaking your head in amazement at the amateurism of the production. Every move they make has been choreographed, and badly; they're stiff as boards, obviously uncomfortable with the routine and with good reason, it makes them look ridiculous and takes away from their singing. They need to fire whomever is telling them to do this, then relax and just SING.I was busy in another room when this show aired on PBS. It sounded good so I left it on for the music, enjoyed it enough to order it afterwards. What a shock to actually watch it. Seriously, just get the CD."
3,A worthy start,"Rough around the edges, but faintly indicative of the masterpiece that was to follow, Explosion's short-lived indie debut showed enough promise for the band's aching sense of melodic bursts to entice listeners to continue following the band."
4,Moeller Boat Seat,"The product was recieved as promised by the seller. As others have mentioned, I am still trying to decifer what ""Heavy Duty"" means. The product is solid for the price but not ""Heavy Duty"". Wish they would have included hardware as the existing hardware was not compatible and I had to purchase hardware for the seat (a setback at time of install as it was done late at night and I almost did not make it in time to the store). The base provided is kind of cheap so I used the one I had which is metal. Overall for the price the seat is good not great. It is pretty comfortable as well. In summary, for the price if I had any future need to get another seat I would probably purchase the same one."
1,Low quality music!,I music is composed without new ideas and the performance is in a low quality. Why did I spend money and time for the CD?
2,An Impartial Opinion.,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I am a big Xena Fan. I've purchased all of the soundtracks that've been released. However, I must say that I found ""Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire"" to be a annoying. I'm not a fan of rap music. The only songs that I really like is ""Xena's Rap"" and ""Let the Spirits Move Me"" Only two songs out of the whole sound track. Is the CD Worth it? Not really, but as a loyal Xena Fan I'm not sorry I bought it. Nonetheless that doesn't mean that I think this is a GREAT Soundtrack. IT ISN""T! But if you love Xena, you'll be ok with this soundtrack. You won't be Pleased! But I doubt you'll be sorry you bought it. However, don't expect it to be GREAT! It is NOT. It's annoying."
3,Great comfort but sacrfice sound quality,"Finally, my iPod earphones stay in my ear. However, the boost in bass is nothing more that the Earjam muffling the sound. And your music seems louder because now the earphone is directly in your ear canal. Never the less, your iPod earphones will fit properly. With the 3 different size, you are more than likely to find the right one for you. And for those that complained that that Earjam irritated or scratched the outside of your ear. To remedy that problem, I suggest the Silicon Replacement Earpads at RadioShack (Model: 33-1994). I placed those around the Earjams themselves and that are a very comfortable fit."
1,"Great idea, but doesn't work","I first found this product in a shop at the San Francisco airport in 2007. There's a piece that clips onto the iPod earbugs and lets you add a nice, soft pad which greatly improved the fit and comfort. So when we bought a 2nd iPod recently, I ordered this. The piece that clips on *doesn't fit* - it's way too big. It doesn't fit either the iPod earbugs or some oval-shaped ones I bought and didn't like because of the fit.I contacted the company (Griffin)and they sent another one, free. Same problem. Doesn't fit. WTF???"
1,Bass is a boon but clarity is a bust,"Got my jams today and clipped them on ready to be blown away by the comfort and sound. Wasn't blown away by either.In my opinion, these totally take away from the range. Everything sounded muffled, like I was listening through water. Tried all three sizes and had the same opinion.Not a great purchase. Regret I have to go through the return process."
3,"Deep in bass, muddy everywhere else","The title basically tells you my opinion of this product. It definitely increases bass, but muddles up everything else. Words can hardly be understood, absolutely awful. I gave it 3 stars for dramatically increases the bass, although at the cost of everything else, it's not worth your money even if it's $15."
1,Lovely fiction,"Eight out of ten for suspense and plot. But this book should be under ""Fiction"". Very sad to see that Cornwell lets his private journalistic ambition sully his integrity as a writer of supposed ""history"". This man has a clear agenda: vilify the Vatican in every possible way, cast aspersions on those who cannot defend themselves, and where possible make the Catholic Church generally and the Vatican ""establishment"" in particular look like a bunch of power-hungry egomaniacs and a den of thieves. Sadly, many ignorant Catholics and non-Catholics won't know enough to refute his slander, and this book is wonderful fodder to anti-Catholics. Avoid this trashy ""journalism""."
4,More Mudpies to Magnets,"Hi, this book was in good shape, no torn pages or writing in it. Thank you very much!"
2,"Display Freezes, Won't Reboot!","This is my second Zen V. Returned the first one because it worked for a month and then kept freezing up on one song. Would NOT reboot despite pushing the tiny reboot/restart button on the side. Exchanged for a new player and within three days it is doint the same thing! I'm going to get another brand. My husband has a Zen Jukebox and has had no problem for years. This is a great size with great features, but that does you no good if the software doesn't work!"
5,Blind Beauty,"This album contains my favorite song of all time...""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" This song is all I need to hear when I feel depressed and it lifts my spirits. The rest of this CD is just as uplifting but nothing can compare to the 5 Blind Boys singing ""Bridge Over Troubled Water."""
5,Marvelous invention!,"For all the reasons the other reviewers listed, this item has become one of my ""must-have-it-with-me"" tools when I work in the garden. I love it!"
5,garden bench,"It is the best thing I have ever bought. If you are an older person , with bad knees or hips, this product is truly a godsend!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Cyclone .095 inch 3-pound spool commercial grade 6-Blade grass trimmer line - Great!,"Price and quality is great! I was looking for the 8-blade star type, however, this line performed just as well.It is good for cutting weeds, while limiting cut above Zoysia grass."
3,It's a nice try for a first album...,"If you enjoy hearing guy bands, then you can't help but compare them with other bands you've heard. I found their songs to be mediocre, but nothing spectacular. I felt Westlife and A1 to be better groups. Their music just hit the spot, but I couldn't get that from Mytown. It's a nice try for their first CD, but maybe the second will be better. Just my opinion here."
3,An acceptable text,"I would recommend reading with a highlighter and marking up a lot of the text because many definitions, points of interest, etc... are not set apart from regular text and it can be difficult locating the information you want/need to know on a particular page because of this. I have already highlighted a good deal of the book so that I can flip through the pages quickly and locate what I need.There are plenty of exercises in the book of easy to medium difficulty, but certainly not many that I would call ""hard.""The text is easy to read even if it is not organized as well as Munkres book. I don't think this is a book anyone would regret getting for learning topology for the first time, but as the title clearly indicates, this is not a book for people taking a second course in topology."
5,PLAYMOBIL Victorian Bride & Groom,"This toy is so cute!!!! It is worth collecting, worthstaring at, worth having on the shelf. What it representsis delightful and dreamy. I am adult, not a child, and Ibought it for its looks. It is adorable, gives me a smile.It is strong and durable too. It will last me many years.---- As a gift for a child, though, the very small piecesshould be taken away before being given to a child. Thechild might eat the little pieces.---- Luisa Felix,FelixHoboken@aol.com"
4,Quite good I must say!,"This is the first ""Shannara"" related book i've read (read ""The Magic Kingdom.... series some years ago)& thought it to be a very enjoyable book. I will now want to eventually read the other books in the ""Shannara"" storyline!"
2,worst of brooks,"I love Brooks, i love all his stories, but this one was no so great. I was so sick of Wren and Garth in the jungle by the end i almost couldnt take it. I love Brooks' descriptive writing but i think he should have shortened this series up a bit."
3,The best book in the Heritage series,So what if you pretty much knew how it was going to end... it was worth the ride! But all of the Heritage books suffer from a hasty tying-up-of-loose-ends in Talismans.
5,Ratings from a reader,This is a very good book for not just younger children but older children also. I should know because I am Thirteen years old. I have read the first and second books in the Dolphin Diaries series and can't wait to read the Riding the Storm.
4,Clothline poles,"Great clothline poles. They have a slot to hook onto the clothes line and adjustable height feature. The adjustable feature is slightly problematic, but once you get it set they work great."
5,Very nice,"The stamped pillowcases looked just like they did in the thumbnail and arrived on time in, good condition. They were a gift so I didn't open the packaging but I'm sure my sister will let me know if there's something wrong with them."
4,"Excellent chillout, tropical feeling, grooves","I just got this CD today and it's absolutely INCREDIBLE... Numbers 4 & 5 are fabulous as are the rest. I'm a big fan of Hi-Fidelity vol.1 and Om Lounge vol.2 and this is right up there with them. By the way-- I never knew Bush could do chillout trance?! It's unlike the rest of the CD, but a fabulous addition... I'd say bite the bullet and buy this one-- it's totally worth it if you want some awesome background grooves that could be listened to for hours..."
2,Fail,I bought 2. 1 started clicking 2 months into use. The other one is still working fine. The clicking one finally failed and became unreadable after about 4 months. Luckily everything was backed up. I had the (now failed) drive in an external HD cage and it seemed to get AWFULLY HOT. That might be why it failed. I have 4 other Seagate drives that I love that run cool and smooth. Heat is really a hard drives biggest enemy. Unless it is a Maxtor drive. Then the Hard Drive itself is it's biggest enemy.
1,Tacky,"I ordered my flowers on Feb. 6th and just now received an email that a refund was just sent.... WITHOUT prior communication! Now I have no flowers less than a week from Valentine's Day. Yet they are still selling there flowers!!In fact, they charged me $10.70 and refunded me $10.69... so I pay for doing business??!!!"
2,He's got a following,"I can appreciate a good singer-songwriter recognized as a musicians musician and I commend Steve Forbert for hanging in there for his fans but I for one am not one of them (with the exception of 2 songs). His lyrics tend to bore me. He's been compared to Dylan (NOT!) and described as a great storyteller. But he doesn't compare to such singer-songwriters as say; John Prine or Bruce Springsteen, just to name a few.The song that I give him the most credit for is ""Song for Katrina."" It's a beautiful ballad. ""Romeo's tune"" is kind of commercial but pretty good. The rest? Sorry. I find it uninteresting and forgettable."
5,CST/BERGER 06-808A 8-Foot Aluminum Grade Rod,"CST/ Berger 06-808A 8-Foot Aluminum Grade Rod in Feet, Tenths HundredthsThis rod is everything as advertised. Easy to use. A good buy. Holds my laser detector well."
3,Great idea but it takes a while...,"When I bother to cook, I usually try to cook for a few people so it's worth my while...I tend to use quite a bit of garlic--maybe a whole head of garlic at a time. (Again, this is when feeding like 6 people or so, so it's not super excessive.)Anyway, this is a great idea, but it doesn't do much garlic at a time. Also, unless I am doing something wrong, you will get particles of the peel in with your garlic (granted, very small pieces, but pieces nonetheless).So...it's pretty ""meh"" in my book. Neat idea, was fun to see how it actually worked."
4,Worth the wait,"For those of us who anxiously awaited Sign of Truth, you will not be disappointed. Tish's voice sounds beautiful, and her songs are just as wonderful. There are one or two that are not instant favorites but most are very good. ""Fire in Winter"" is...hot. ""Fencepost"" is achingly sad and haunts you long after the song is over. For those who have not purchased a Tish recording before, you will find yourself buying another, and another, and another."
2,Not much bigger than a back pack,I purchased this thinking it would be a nice addition to our set. It is not much bigger than a back pack and for $70 it is over priced. I am sending this one back and ordered the back pack for $20! I do love the pattern and this entire line. Just not a good value for this piece if you ask me.
5,"You won't see this on DVD any time soon, if at all.","From an LA Times article dated 9-6-07 there is this quote from miniseries writer Cyrus Nowrasteh about ABC not releasing this miniseries on DVD.""said he was told by a top executive at ABC Studios that ""if Hillary weren't running for president, this wouldn't be a problem."""""
3,Looks nice,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend; a science geek. While he was very excited to get it, he noticedthat one of the pendulum's was off balance. While slightly unbalanced, it did affect the rhythm of the swing.Probably something I would've never noticed on my own."
4,HELLA 500 Stone Guard - Older Style,"I ordered this particular one because it is the older style and not the newer Hella stone guards that comes with the Hella 500FF lights now. The reason I bought the older style is because I wanted the 500 covers to match the Rallye 4000 stone guards. The newer style covers are a completely new design and look somewhat odd when placed below the 4000 lights. Now the light covers from the 4000s and 500s match like they were factory installed on my FJ Cruiser. :-D FYR, I rated this product 4-stars because my original set that came with my 500s only lasted 2-seasons before one cracked."
2,I was a little surprized....,I was a little surprized when only 1 cover came with the purchase. I guess I expected a pair of covers and not just 1. Shame on me.
3,Cute story,"This book is a very easy read, and the basic story line is cute. I guess it's aimed towards teens, however, it does tend to treat it's readers as stupid. Also the characters are not really like their TV counterparts. But I'll probably buy the other books, too. I find it weird that the authors won't identify themselves!"
4,Not like the picture,"This is just the light bulb with a rubber boot, not the entire light/number plate assembly. Be sure that's all you want before ordering."
3,Aggravating!,"I loved the original Black Market , especially for Bank robber Armiggdeon time and was gravely disappointed to not find them here. The replacement dubs here are awkward, cutting some vocals off in mid-word. I was wondering if these are original outakes or something thrown together more recently. Does anybody know? I guess the problem here is that when your so familiar with the orginal, any differences are disturbing to the flow and expectation you have for the song."
4,Kick me where it hurts!,"I have to agree with the throng - this is WAY better than _Give 'Em Enough Rope_. Kinda puzzled, though... why did they bother remastering this? The darn thing only came out in 1993... did they do that bad a job on it the first time? Or was Sony just looking for an excuse to let Bob Dylan's catalog go untouched for ANOTHER year.....!"
2,beatle wannabe?,"I find nothing catchy in these melodies when the music is pretty shallow and lacking in substance. Arthur's vocals lacks the clarity and definition when he tries to hit the high notes. The electronic drums and loud samples sound annoying. If I want to hear Lennon and McCartney I'll go buy a Beatles album...when i think of Arthur Yoria, I think of that band Oasis. Because they both have the same attitude about the Beatles."
4,A Real Gem,"I was quite surprised by this lathe. Minor assembly was easy and straightforward, and center to center alignment was dead-on right out of the box. The ""soft start"" motor caused a little consternation when it didn't spin right away when I turned it on, but this is a really nice feature. Shaft play and runout are nearly non-existent, and the live center provided is more than acceptable. The variable speed control gives an adequate range of speeds for roughing, sanding and finishing.I have used this lathe to turn many pens (the purpose for which I bought it) and it has exceeded my expectations. I have also done some small amount of face turning, and was well-pleased with the results. My only complaints are these: A little more power would not go unappreciated for face-turning; and the tailstock spindle grub screw tends to loosen up over time allowing the spindle just a little too much play.For the price, an excellent lathe for pen and spindle turning; underpowered for larger face turning."
2,A Tabloid Smear? Questions Posed Go Unanswered,"The author casts Sandow within the greater phenom of bodybuilding, a craze that sprang up at the end of the 19th century. And nobody did more for muscle mania than Eugene Sandow. But after going over familiar ground, the author teases the reader with an undefined relationship between Sandow and a fellow strong man, and an unknown something that led to trouble within Sandow's family late in his life. Both have the odor of a tabloid smear. These questions are posed -- tease, tease, wink, wink -- but no answers are given. Either the author was too lazy to fully investigate, or the topics had no foundation and should never have been raised at all. If Sandow were alive today, he'd give the author a well deserved punch in the mouth."
2,This is a textbook and not much else.,"I read this as a student in seminary. It was the textbook for an evangelism class. If you are looking for a practical guide, this is not it."
3,Health Care USA,"Book was in good condition, received very quickly although it was the wrong edition that I needed but I made it work."
2,not worth the wait,"I ran out to get this album the day it came out, I was pretty excited for it's release. There are some decent moments here, but overall, this is lame. Their last album was damn good, this one was a waste of money."
3,very good except on some reflective surfaces,I use this mouse with different pc base instruments in the lab where I work. It seamlessly works with windows xp professional and 2000. I do not have much to add that is different from the other reviews except on some reflective/shiny surfaces it does not work very well. I have noticed this on one polished wood table and a lab bench with a formica finish. I end up putting the mouse on a notebook to use it. This is not true of any other optical mouses I have used.
3,Slightly disappointing,"As a experienced mainframe database programmer making a shift to the client server environment, I found it hard to come to terms with the material. My personal opinion is that Coffman has a problem getting the subject matter across to all but the most seasoned SQL Server professional. Most of what is in the text may be found within the books on line facility.I have resorted to the book by Otey and Conte 'SQL Server 7 Developer's Guide' which I found far superior, covering SQL Server 7 from the Development and Maintenance points of view, and easy to understand. .....Steve Simon"
4,Good little movie (Madchen Amick is outstanding),"I rented this on the offchance that Ryan O'neal was in it, and it turned out to be better than I expected. It's a small movie that only takes place in a few settings, but you can tell that all the actors and production personnel were doing their absolute best to make it stand out. The ending was something not expected, which was a pleasant surprise. Madchen Amick is gorgeous, just stunning to look at, and she was my favorite part of the film. Recommended if you're interested in a seductive/political/thriller movie."
5,MXRC,MXRC filter as advertised. Came in plain cardboard packaging but appears to be new. Water tastes fine. Would buy again.
3,Some more questions...,"What about the risks of radon, when living under ground? Are there specific venting systems required to avoid this problem?"
2,What's all the hype about?,"There's not much to ""Lean Back"". It's just another track that's been way over-hyped by all the hip-pop fans. Fat Joe isn't a terrible MC, but the rest of the Terror Squad couldn't hold it's own since the rap world lost Big Pun. The beat sounds like a Lil' Jon wannabe - east coast rap meets crunk from the south. It doesn't work! This is just a below-average track that was way played-out for it's own good, and I don't believe the Terror Squad will be able to re-create a hit like ""Lean Back""."
