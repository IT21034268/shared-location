1,Didn't work like my other model,"Hoped to have the same espresso maker in our vacation home as the one I had at my home purchased from Williams Sonoma, but this one didn't drain water from the reservoir into the steam generating chamber. I tried running plain water through several times and removed/re-seated the reservoir but just got a trickle out of the unit. Amazon gets a star for prompt handling of the refund, but I would have been much happier with a fully funtional unit. Had a problem with a Krups unit purchased through eBay a few years ago and I wonder if re-furbs show up marketed as new units."
1,Worked once then stopped heating water,"I bought the EM-100 from Amazon over a year ago when we were remodeling our kitchen. It was hidden away in the garage still in the box until last week. After taking it out of the box and setting it up it worked once with a Starbuck's espresso pod. Unfortunately, the next morning the heat water light would not come on and a few minutes later, when I turned the knob to make an espresso the coffee looked great, but it was cold. A phone call to Cuisinart didn't fix the problem. The heater appears to have failed or a thermal breaker opened up. Then, when I read the warranty shipping information I found a sticker saying it was a refurbished unit and I had only a 90 day warranty that had long ago expired. So, it was an expensive single espresso because this machine is headed to the scrap heap."
5,Outstanding yet again.,"This DVD is an outstanding portrayel of the Fire and Passion that is Incendio. The band is caught in full flight as they take the veiwer on an exotic journey through many different styles and rhythms. The veiwer can partake in the energy projected from each of the band members in a way that was previously impossibe unless you were at an actual concert.Incendio's ""Dia y Noche"" is a great way to bring the full Incendio expierence home to enjoy whenever the mood strikes. ""Dia y Noche"" is a must have for any Incendio fan and a great addition to any music collection."
1,"this is a WORKBOOK, not reading material!","This book is reading material- appears to be a workbook, maybe a companion book to a text somewhere? Anyhow, not worth purchasing unless this is what you want!"
5,Archxerciser,"A simple practical product that is efficient for strengthening the arch. Sure, a person can probably achieve the same results by using a towel and scrunching it up with your toes, and then re-positioning the towel, etc. The Archxerciser, though, makes doing this exercise a lot simpler and efficient. My physiotherapist understood immediately the value of this product and immediatelyl took down the information about it."
4,Foot Strengthening,"This really works, cheap and good for you toning the foot/heel that hurts. I use it a lot and do recommend it."
4,Simple and effective,I like running and I have completed a few marathons in the past few years. Recently I have had pain in the ball of my feet. I got this device and a few other items and I do believe the pain is vanished after about 2 months of use (for now anyway).
2,"Book fine, CDs unusable","Book seems to be a usable introduction to Linux, but don't buy it to get the software. The second CD seems to have a production problem. Both the original and the replacement sent to me hang up the install process and result in an unbootable PC."
2,Stumbles but recovers.,"I could have done without section two altogether. After a promising start hinting at the changes in the world after a massive Sino-American War, the novel drips into a boring diatribe about how horny an old man can be for a young prostitute. This relentlessly unpleasant section nearly ended all hopes of this devoted fan finishing the book. Fortunately, a recovery of sorts occurs about 150 pages in which gives a satisfying taste of what good fiction can do."
2,I gave up.,"I have loved nearly every Updike novel I've read, especially the Rabbit books, but I had to give up on this one. The book's setting in the future adds nothing to the story, and Updike's obsession with flowers and shrubs, religion and sex (especially that between old men and very young women) became just too tedious. When he went so far as to compare a young female character in the book to a ""cut of meat"" I tossed the book to the floor in disgust. (It's still there.)"
3,Doesn't keep time,You can adjust the speed but it never gets it right. after about an hour in a half your ether too fast or too slow. i can never get it right. if you need it to wake up being inaccurate will frustrate you. early isn't so bad but being late has pissed me off. i got it cause i have brownouts alot.
5,Gets the bugs off!,This is great for cleaning the bug-goo off of the windshield of our airplane. Also use it on the faceshields of our motorcycle helmets.
5,Required tool for the motorcycle,"Excellent product, I bought several so I wouldn't run out. Great to clean the windshield on the touring bike."
5,"Plexus, always a winner","I've used Plexus on my motorcycle fairing, windshield and helmet for years. It works well for cleaning laptops and electronics too. The price has gone up considerably but a can lasts for quite some time. Don't get me wrong, Plexus is great stuff but there are alternatives at much lower cost."
5,"Yes, it's expensive but so worth it!","I bought my first can for $12 about 4 yrs ago. I ran out this year and couldn't find it in the bike shop anymore. I came to Amazon and they had it at almost twice the cost so I checked other internet sites. It could not have almost doubled in price, could it? Yes, it could because Amazon's price was the same as everywhere else but since I don't have to pay S&H here at Amazon, it was a bargain compared to other mail order suppliers. I LOVE this stuff. It's worth every penny. I just use it more sparingly now. Buy it, you'll love it."
4,Dissappointed,"I am very pleased with the dvd i bought (Brotherhood Season 3) but very dissappointed that it was the final season. At least i have all three seasons on dvd to watch.My purchases of dvd's from Amazon has been excellent, never a problem.Lorraine"
3,"OK book, few pictures, intro to basic skill level","This book is an OK start. Not a lot of pictures of the projects. The colored panels of the wood species is OK, but not very useful.This guy *REALLY* likes his biscuit joints. It like he's a cheer leader for them. Got tiring after a while.The table saw section is poor, misses a lot of information on the most important machine in your shop (zero clearance inserts, what makes a good fence.. etc).Does not really cover finishes that much.. touches on them but the most important part of any project after construction is the finish and again, very limited, basic information is given.Not a terribly bad book, but not a great one. Good buy used for abut $8-10.One SMALL nit pick - on the cover, there are many errors with regard to safety: long sleeves, wearing jewelry... even if all you are doing is gluing joints that stuff should come off at the door."
2,This book was not very captivating.,"I found it hard to like any of the characters in this book! The women were unchallenging and too easily seduced, especially the herione, White Willow. I found the characters dull and unbelievable. The Indian wisdom Iron Cloud tried to convey to Timothy seemed detached and impersonal. The love encounters tried too much too soon an seemed awkward and clinical to me. The plot was mediocre in keeping me interested. I found myself skipping sentences just to get through it- and I never do that!"
5,Enjoyed,I justed finished reading Savage Mists. I could not put it down. I enjoyed the story about Damita and Timonthy. The way that Iron Cloud and the Omaha people received Damita and Timothy into there lives was great. It was a great story about two different cultures and how they came together. I always enjoy reading the books by Cassie Edwards. Please keep them coming.
3,"Casting is spot on, but...","Ken Stott looks the part of Rebus more than John Hannah, and Claire Price DEFINITELY looks the part of Siobhan more than Gayanne Potter. The supporting cast is equally effective, and the stories (Ian Rankin's The Falls and Fleshmarket Close) are translated to the screen reasonably well.Still, things are definitely lacking here. Gone was every ounce of Rebus' ongoing personal narrative, and the stories are much weaker for it. Gone also was that sense of self-destructiveness that is so very Rebus. These two stories have been reduced to simply average British mysteries. Not bad by any means, but no where near as gripping as Hannah's Rebus. If you're looking for Ian Rankin's stories to come alive on the screen, pick up John Hannah's Rebus."
5,Great character study and setting!,Ken Stott is great as the curmudgeonly aging detective paired with the attractive and smart Sioban. Often gruesome crimes leave Stott at odds with the rules of police work and he plays the rogue cop oh so well. The cinematography paints an interesting portrait of Edinboro (sp?)as well. Too bad they didn't keep making the series.
5,Short but very sweet --- the album that launched WM,"There are only six relatively short tracks on this mini-album, which catapulted composer Wim Mertens from nowhere to near-stardom in his native Belgium and other European countries. Steve Reich is an obvious influence (both in terms of minimalism and love for unusual instrumentations --- in fact, I mistook some parts for synthesizers when I first heard the album!), but more melodic and less repetitive in character. The haunting instrumental ballad ""Close Cover"" was the jingle for Belgian national radio's late-night programme for years (when I lived there). My favorite is the title track, which builds up layer by layer, in ""chaconne"" fashion, over a catchy arpeggiated piano pattern to reach a thunderous climax. Tracks 3 and 6 are likewise classics in their genre. If you want to surprise a discriminating (but open-minded) listener with an unexpected musical delight, this is the album!"
5,LOVE THE CD & DVD,"After months of searching for this DVD, I finally found it here, and at a great price! The Karaoke version is great, and my kids love watching all of the videos! We listen to the CD in the car too, which is great to have the DVD at home and the CD in the car!"
4,My Toddler Loves This!,"We received this DVD as a gift for my toddler. I wasn't sure if she would like it because she had already ""graduated"" to full-length feature films like Sound of Music and Disney movies, but she LOVES it and asks for it all the time. The music is very well done and I really appreciate that the CD comes with it. So often my toddler wants to listen to the music that goes with the shows that she watches but that means an additional purchase for me. What a great idea that this one comes with it included! We are very happy with this gift and think you will be too."
3,"Good collection, but not for beginners","This is a nice collection of works that deal with the Tibetan Buddhist approach to death. Note that it is basically an edited volume of translated pieces, and as such is not perhaps the best introduction to the subject. The first two translations in the volume, especially ""Death and the Bodhisattva Trainings"" are very instructive and inspiring. Many of the other translations, however, are quite esoteric and detailed. If you have some previous knowledge of this subject, this could well be a rewarding read. If you are looking for a good introduction to the topic, however, better would be ""The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying."""
1,Acting is Everything...not so good,"I could barely make it through the first few pages of this book. There is so much name dropping and quoting that it's hard to slog through. In the first 50 pages, there was nothing helpful at all. It was just the author saying ""so-and-so says this about acting"" and then writing a long-winded quote from some well known actor. That's ok once or twice in a chapter, but when there are 3 pages of nothing but actor quotes, it gets monotonous and boring.Another part of this book that I don't like it how it's all in point form. There's no paragraph structure, no movement. Just a bunch of bullet points and, as I mentioned before, long winded quotes that have nothing do with teaching you how to actually break into the acting business. I recommend Self-Management for Actors by Bonnie Gillespie, and Acting -- Make It Your Business by Paul Russell. Your money would be much better spent on those books than on this bit of pompous arrogance in book-form."
4,Another winner from Red Green...,"Red, nephew Harold, the geek, DaltonHumphrey, Mike Hamer, Ed Fridd and Co.show of all how to handle kids, thePossum Lodge way! Yikes! A long runningshow that actually started as a comedyskit on 'Smith and Smith' back in 1979.It all went horribly wrong (or right!)since then. A Canadian comedy classicon the Comedy Central of Canada show.Outstanding! And clean enough to beshown on Public TV without losing it'soriginality, et, al. Pick Up On It!"
2,lame and irritating,"This book should never have been published in its current condition. It is ill-thought-out and clumsily written. The characters constantly come to conclusions on insufficient evidence, nearly everything is told rather than shown, and often character descriptions contradict behavior. Avoid."
5,Interesting insight into the German war machine,"Stephen Fritz examines nearly every imaginable aspect of the life of the average German Landser during the Second World War. He does a great job of bringing together numerous personal letters, diaries, and memoirs into a comprehensive, well-organized, and highly readable account. Fritz makes it possible to understand what all soldiers-not only Germans-went through in history's greatest conflict. This is a must have for reenacters, historians, and anyone who wants to learn more warfare."
2,Not the best,"This book seems to lack a voice. Considering that it is mostly quotes from other(and better) books about the german fighting man, it just didn't seem to flow well. The writing style reminded me of the terrible english papers I wrote for basic college writing. Besides that, it seemed like 50% of the quotes came from the Forgotten Soldier, making this book feel like a cliff notes version of Sajer's. In the time that it would take you to slog though this book, you could read two or three first hand accounts and form your own opinions."
2,Better sources exist,"Although well-researched, this book is really little more than a book of quotations lifted from several primary sources. The result is rather monotonous and fails to provide the detail and context that makes those primary sources so informative. A much better idea is to simply read the memoirs written by the men who were actually there (and there are plenty of them). They provide much greater insight into the life of a German Landser than this second-hand account."
1,Read The Forgotten Soldier Instead,This book was disapointing. Fritz just excerpts the work of other people particullary Guy Sajer's Forgotten Soldier. Sajer provided a much more interesting study of the Landser than Fritz. My recommendation is skip Fritz's work entirely and proceed to the Forgotten Soldier.
2,Just Okay,"Readable, but that's about it -- this book lacks the energy and complexity of previous brilliant LeGuin works. It is mostly a much less rigorous reworking of the extraordinary novel ""The Dispossessed"", with an inadequte attempt to address the issue of Ekumen superiority vs.""native"" wisdom -- the question which formed the center of the astonishingly brilliant ""Left Hand of Darkness."" All the conflicts here drift away, not only unresolved but unfaced in the rigorous way I expect from LeGuin. Never gets to the main issues, either those between the twin planets or regarding their relations with the Ekumen. Derivative and disappointing -- read ""Left Hand,"" or LeGuin's neglected masterpiece ""Malafrena"" for sustained thought, not vagaries."
2,harder than thought,I have a 6 yr old and thought this would have been the perfect christmas present for him. This game was harder for him than I had anticipated. I have played the game myself and found the same problem. It gets him frustrated and he tends to put it away quickly.
2,Broke Within a Week,"The Westbend wind up alarms clock, especially the Baby Ben style, are my favorite clocks. It is very disappointing that of the three I bought recently 2 were broke within a week. They both just stopped! The wind up key is so close to the other tools that I keep breaking nails. I have been buying these alarms since 1979 but these clocks from China are deplorable in workmenship. I will be looking for another brand."
3,not a bad book,"I picked up this book because I thought it would help me get a decent perspective on the times I grew up in. It didn't quite do that, I'm afraid, but it brought into sharp focus the lives of the two narrators, Jeff and Ruth. Personally I would like to have seen them dig a little deeper into the nitty-gritty of the times instead of focussing so narrowly on their own lives, which is pretty limited really. It's not a bad book actually, it's just I expected more analysis of the Vietnam mess and the aftermath and what America suffered. As a personal memoir, it's fine. I don't feel I've gained any great insights, that's all.- Terry Smeeth"
2,Disappointing,"I had been looking forward to reading this book, but after the first hundred pages I abandoned it. Great concept, catchy title, but Ruth and Jeff's lives simply weren't very interesting to me."
2,"Great, but on the 3rd one!","It seems like a good flashlight, but it keeps breaking. The company did replace the broken ones, but I'm tired of asking and waiting for the new ones to arrive. We'll be getting a different one."
1,"Greasy,hair looks oily:(","My wife ordered this product to improve her hair and scalp's look.The smell is good,but it leaves your hair greasy and oily,looks like someone was frying potatoes on your head:)I don't recommend this item,even after castor oil hair looks better."
4,The essential refrence guide for Conspiracy enthuists.,"Whether you are a true conspiracy theorist or just some one who likes to laugh at them, this book is an excellent refrence for how the conspricay community views many secret orginazations."
3,??????????????????,"I was taught that if you can't say anything nice,don't say anything at all.So I will stop here.And I love Los Lobos!"
4,I'm sorry I waited so long to buy this CD...,"I was really blown away when I first listened to it, and even though my enthusiasm has been tempered a little after a few listens, this is still a great CD. Judging by the tone of some of the reviews below, LL is suffering from that problem truly genius artists have - once you release a few ground-breaking records, if you stay at that level people will say you're lazy and complacent. I personally think it's OK that they have brought some more outstanding music into the world, even if it isn't light years ahead of their past efforts. Every track is solid and a good listen. For me Dave Alvin's baritone bossonova on ""Somwhere in Time"" and the moody reverb on ""Wreck of the Carlos Rey"" really stand out."
4,"good, but not their best.","Los Lobos is the most under-rated band in the US. Known (unfortunately) for their cover of La Bamba, they have written some of the BEST rock and roll ever!!! And nobody seems to notice. Scared of their latin name? Scared of the memories of La Bamba stuck in your head and overplayed? Just buy a copy of Good Morning Aztlan, The Neighborhood, By the Light of the Moon, How Will the Wolf Survive and their newest, The Ride, and you WILL see that this band is pure genius!!!! The Ride stumbles a bit in places....Charmed seems awkward and never flows, the Tom Waits colaboration is painful to listen to, and the Wreck of the Carlos Rey brings up too many memories of the much better song, the Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald (Gordon Lightfoot). But then you have the genius of Rita, Somewhere in Time, La Venganza de los Pelados and Bobby Womack's classic 110th Street and you can see what you've been missing if you haven't caught on to Los Lobos yet."
3,Watered-down Scotch Guide,"While I find the merit in what Brander wants to accomplish, I found his guide needed slighty more aging. And despite displaying some subtle complexity, it still pales in comparison with Michael Jackson's 'bible' of scotch whisky. This guide provides a nice, simple taste of scotch whisky, making it a good fit for the beginner or novice. More mature drinkers will appreciate the flavor of the guide, but come away thirsting for something heartier."
3,Looked Good in Picture,"Style and function are good, but one of the the workstation wheel inserts has already failed and has to be balanced with a telephone book. Price of item was atractive but shipping and handling charges were excessive"
5,oldie,Good old time guitar and cowboy/western songs. Got it because I like this kind of music and it is a blast from the past.
3,Can you say Every Time I Die?,"A blatant rip off of every time i die. If they're a rip off of someone else, well, then just keep going down the chain until you get to the original. Too many of the songs are based off the standard blues scale. They sort of blend together. Also, the vocalist lacks so much of what ETID's brings.Nothing special.They are Christian, though, and if you don't like 'godless' music, then go for it. Course, you're missing better music.The name is sorta stupid, too, for how unshocking the sound is."
1,Liar,Product is fine cans are not 12oz they are 11oz which amounts to a whole can i am shorted over the case.
4,Great Fun Pop Psychadelia,"Of course, you get one of the Top 100 Rock 'n Roll tracks of all time with PICTURES OF MATCHSTICK MEN and while on the surface, many of the other tracks offer echoes of ""Matchstick Men,"" that would be like complaining many of the Ramones tracks sound the same :-)However, a deeper listen reveals the true pop psychadelia genius of the Status Quo - not only do most the tracks hold up great - they are all great fun - and a showcase of great musicians and great songwriter. While these are museum quality tracks - these are definitely not just historical timepieces but tracks that are just as relevant and fresh today.This CD definitely belongs in everyone's collection of great rock n' roll."
4,Very Helpful,This book is full of very helpful tips on fixing and maintaining your boat. I especially liked the information on products that seemed especially helpful in cleaning and waxing the boat. I have used several and found them all to work as the author stated. It is a welcome addition to my library while I am restoring a fiberglass runabout.
5,Good and basic clock,"This is a basic clock that is best probably for a nightstand or other small space. It plugs in and has an alarm, if needed. Nothing fancy, but it works fine."
1,The case against this book,"The case for gold is a rehash of Ron Paul's positions on the Fed, on government, and on spending. He basically rehashs everything that he says in public in this book. There is nothing new in this book and it basically is a waste of ink and paper."
5,Great!,"As a outside sales person and one who have signs customers Contracts worth $75,000 it is nice to hand a customer to use the Tourneau pen. They all do the same thing, when they begin to write all of a sudden they stop and look at the pen, and say ""wow great pen""."
4,Excellent Reference!,"This was an excellent reference! The pictures identifying the differences, between everything from trim pieces to gauges, made it very easy to discern model and year changes. FYI this is mostly for asthetics and options. Not a lot of focus on mechanicals."
2,All About Characters,"This is one of those rare gems - a vast ensemble cast of excellent performers, all creating individual, and quite believable characters in a bittersweet story of the last days of a summer hotel. Maureen Stapleton is outstanding as she always was, but the rest of the cast is not to be forgotten either. There's no action as such, except for a great scene of a baseball game, because the film is well focused on characterization. Who needs noise and action in every film? This should be on DVD! You won't regret watching this one if you care about people. Rates 5 stars (even though Amazon only registers 2 - I gave it 5! Must be a technical glitch.). See it."
5,Finally...I got my favorite songs,The product is great! but I had to wait a little too long to get it.
1,Worthless piece of crap,Worthless crap that constantly jams. I bought this because I thought Swingline made quality staplers. Boy was I mistaken. This doesn't work any better than the wothless $2 OfficeMax brand stapler. Save your money and buy something of higher quality.
3,Very noisy,"Overall decent, nothing exceptional to brag about.Main gripe is it's extremely loud motor.It also takes forever to recognize DVDs and start playing.Have only had 2 weeks, will see what else comes up."
5,Elvis sings gospel,"This is a great CD, all of your favorite Elvis gospel songs and a few you may have never heard, all of which are done as no one but Elvis could ever do."
5,Elvis Rocked Gospel! Loved this album!,"This album has something for everyone from rocking tunes to lovely ballads.Some songs are old favorites and others were new to us. Loved ""Run On"", ""Bosom of Abraham"", ""Peace in the Valley"" and ""I John"" in particular.Great choice if you are buying one gospel album with Elvis singing."
5,Elvis:Ultimate Gospel,"I love this CD! The background singers are a little heavy at times, but that's okay."
4,A wonderful addition to Elvis' catalog,"I just picked up this CD, and as a huge Elvis fan, I am happy to have a lot of this gospel material included from the original mastertapes. What they have done reveals a lot of subtle features that previous releases did not.The reason I can't give it 5 stars is that I think they left off a few songs that are essential to ANY gospel compilation. Stand By Me, I Believe, and Where No One Stands Alone are songs I think could have been used in place of a few of the later gospel songs.But, I love what is here, and the sound and packaging is great. If you don't want to shell out for the 2 CD Amazing Grace or the 3 CD Peace In The Valley, this is a nice introduction to Elvis' gospel."
5,Elvis' Gospel Music,Sends goose bumps all over me...so much feeling and reverence to each song he signs. I love spiritual music and Elvis' style and love of Jesus is obvious. Great prices at Amazon encourages me to buy my music from them.
4,totally enjoyable,"totally enjoyable with Elvis singing the gospel. I wouldn't classify myself as an Elvis fan, yet I love his voice. The cd is done well."
5,"An excellent read, for recovering accountants, and others!","Richard Neumann's Adrian Smith is Douglas Adams's Zaphod Bebblebrox, with a CPA qualification (Certified Public Accountant). A larger than life satirical hero, but an accountant?!After all, we in the US did invent Star Wars, Star Trek ... and Enron.I thoroughly recommend this book as a very well written story, with great dialogue, memorable characters set in an interesting period of history (San Francisco's Panama-Pacific Exhibition of 1915 and the beginning of the First World War in Europe), and a very satisfying conclusion - opening the way for more Adrian Smith Chronicles?This reader wants to see additional titles on Adrian Smith CPA's adventures at large in Richard Neumann's delightful universe."
2,"Something old, something used.","Two of the short stories in this book, ""Running out of Dog"" and ""Gone down to Corpus"" are not new stories. Running out of Dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from Mr. L. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people. But, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original.The others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters Mr. Lehane writes so well about. None of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. They are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation.We waited a long time for another Lehane. This book certainly does not showcase his talents."
3,Coronado Review,"I was disappointed in this book. Found it difficult to get interested in and read. I enjoyed all his other books, just not this one. I am not usually a reader of short stories and that may be part of it, but it was just a lot on the dark side."
2,URGH......Don't start here with Dennis Lehane,"Dennis Lehane is quickly becoming my one of my favorite authors, and I was very excited to see something new for him (short stories), but these just are not very good. Some stories have potential, but they just don't get developed and others are just BORING. If you've never read Lehane, I recommend him HIGHLY, just don't start with this book."
2,The rest of the story,"This and other books on Lean and the Toyota Production System, while valuable, present a very one-sided, idealized and incomplete view. To get the view from the inside, you must readNotes from Toyota-Land: An American Engineer in Japan. You will also learn surprising things about Japanese culture."
5,"Good service, great price","Product in good condition as seller described. It was delivered promptly. Great price. I like this book, but few years ago somebody borrow it and didn't returned. Probably they like it too. Now I have it back. Thank you."
3,used books worth the money,"I purchsed 6 of these books from different places on Amazon. They said the condition was very good to good. A couple of the very good ones were more like fair, and some of the very good ones were excellent. All in all worth the money spent."
4,Mystic's Manuel,"""Hermetic Freemasonry"" is for any esoteric student being introduced into the ""Ancient Mysteries"" of learning. Frank C. Higgins does an incredible job breaking down decades of research into a succinct 124+ page book, while possessing the full authenticity of interpretation of a Fellow Craft. Such an introduction into Freemasonry is essential to all students deciphering secret societies and their Codes & Symbols."
4,Excellent construction,"What can I say its well built. The lock hole could be bigger, but the plastic thickness and quality are superior. The inside fits perfect the cartridges."
5,Great book for urban owners,"I believe the author hit a need that has been overlooked in many other books. Not everyone has the fields and equipment readily available to teach their dog how to flush and retreive like the pros do it. He also makes an excellent point that many gun dogs live in urban homes and must have the training needed to meet people politely and walk well on a leash, not just hunt birds. He does a good step-by-step instructions with tips for finding ways to expose your dog to the sounds and enviroment of hunting in an urban setting. I've used several of his ideas with my Springer Spaniel and she has responded extremely well."
5,Best Gun Dog Training Book,This is one of the best Gun Dog training books ever!!! The book is well written with clear instructions and pictures. It covers everything from basic obedience to hunt tests.
5,Excellent NCLEX-RN review. Simply the best!!,"I graduated in 2000 and tried the NCLEX 4 times. I tried Kaplan, Lippincot, Mosby, you name it non of them helped. Kaplan was way too simple and wouldn't explain enough strategies. Lippincot and Mosby where too complicated and not user friendly. By just buying the Strategies for success and Comprehensive Review books from Saunders and creating a good study plan was able to finally pass on my fifth attempt stoping the computer on the 75th question. The way these books explain the strategies are so good that you will get to the point where if you don't know the answer, by learning the strategies you will choose the correct answer by elimination. But the best key for success is determination and avoiding procrastination. Oh, also... practice, practice, and practice questions until you drop. At least 100 to 200 questions a day!!!"
4,I PASSED!! :),"I can honestly say that I went through the entire review book. I am not sure if the book helped because it was a good review or if knowing that I took the time to review increased my confidence (which helped me pass the NCLEX). Either way, I highly recommend this review book - I glanced at many others and Saunders was the best that I found (in my opinion). There are TONS of review questions! There are also helpful explanations with each question - the most important aspect to me was to practice answering the multiple choice questions (picking out the best answer, highest priority, etc) in order to build a much needed confidence for the exam day. GOOD LUCK! :)"
5,Great quality product,"It was easy to use and navigate. It helped me pass my test. By using this book, I felt I had the right assistance to pass."
3,"good review question, wrong format","I graduated from nursing school 4 years ago, and took the NCLEX for the first time last week. This book was a great review of things that I learned in nursing school (which I needed), but the practice questions (thousands of them) were alot easier than the ones I received on the NCLEX. The NCLEX doesn't focus on knowledge (as this book does), it focuses more on analysis, application and critical thinking. If you need a refresher, this is a great book, if you are genuinely worried about passing NCLEX, reconsider."
3,very buggy application,"Typically I do not write reviews of the product but this I have to make an exception.I did follow up with every step Symantec recommend before the installation procedure.I scanned my registry for every entry of old application and deleted everything.However, it still seems to have problem with the Outbreak Alert, and Symantes doesnot a clue how to fix this problem… no response from tech support…For the amount money they charge they should be able to afford better Testers.Anyway, whoever is looking for the upgrade, it is good package but it requires a lot of improvements, and be aware most likely you will get a problem, unless you are willingto reformat your system and start from scratch…"
2,Not yet....,"I used to be a Norton customer, but have not used it on my PC in a long time. Instead, I will test it on my friends' desktop. This bundle is full of features, looks very nice and it scans a little faster. However, Norton's problems remain the same: it's slow, it's a resource hog and it's expensive. Norton is still one of the most trusted security programs out there, and it does the job very well, but, prepare yourself to see your PC become slower after installation. Definitely not the worst, but we all know there are better things out there."
3,Firewall sucks,"The anti-virus program works great, but the firewall is lacking. It slows the system down and there is no way to get rid of it.Just get Norton Anti-virus; don't get Internet Security."
1,Installation problems,"I have been using Symantec products since 1998. My pc used to have all the latest versions of Norton Antivirus,Firewall and Systemworks.However, this year, Norton Internet Security seems to install normally without any problems, but, it does not. The firewall is turned off on its own, and the Antivirus bundled with the package is unable to complete a full system scan. Needless to say the instructions on Symantec's website (the free ones) have been followed to the letter, without any result.I would advise you to try out the trial version of their software first, to make sure everything works as it should, before losing your cash.Had their customer support service been able to assist me with the problems, I wouldnt have rated the package so low, but for such a crucial part of my pc's security, I expect a fully functional and operational program for the price I pay"
1,Not Good At All !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,These people are right. This version does not work well at all.I downloaded it and it will not run. Finally got to talk to symantec customer service after 2 hour wait on hold. After insisting on a refund for the download they tried to put me to a tech support but advised of a two hour wait. I don't think so.What are you people doing ?????????. I've used norton for years and never had a problem. All good things come to an end. Bad support and bad service. Can you say McAfee.
1,Beware!,"if you already bought this, you have one of the following ""isssues"":subscription issuesvirus issuesinstallation issuesLiveUpdate issueserror message issuesproduct activation issuesWindows XP SP2 Infoother software issueshere is the online support to fix these up, but better to just return this garbage! [...]"
2,Major Slowdowns,"I think NIS 2005 has gotten to be more of a pain than a protective measure. I recently installed this program and used it for about a day, and couldn't stand it any longer. It took forever to boot and then it ran ran slowly after that, once I got it installed. And I don't don't have a slow machine (3ghz, 1gb ram).It also had problems with these programs1. MyIE22. Maxthon3. Mircrosoft network explorer (it sometimes worked, when it did it froze up after a couple of minutes)After I got frustrated with this product. I decided to just install anti-virus and it wouldn't let me. I find this very annoying because every other product suite I have installed it has let me choose what programs I want to install.I don't reccomend this product. I am going back to using NIS 2003.I do not reccommend this product"
1,Piece of Junk,"Do not waste your money on this or any ""internet security"" software unless you really know your way around a computer. It will cause nothing but trouble as it tries to take over your machine. You will likely encounter trouble sending and receiving e-mail. It uses up a lot of system resources, just to name a couple... It's a lot more trouble than it's worth. All you really need is simple Virus protection. Norton AV is fine but there are better. AVG is a good anti-virus solution and it will not take over your machine like Norton does."
1,Don't Use Norton!,"I have always been a McAfee user but one time, I received a Norton free-trial along with a new computer I purchased. One time, I used Norton to scan for viruses. It didn't find a thing. Right after it finished, I scanned it with McAfee. McAfee found 3 infected files! There's no tellin how long I could have had those viruses. If I would'nt have scanned with McAfee, I would have never know I had any viruses."
1,worst product ever,"wow ,im a tech and i've never seen a product that can do so many bad things to the system , IM IMPRESSED SYMANTEC !!! After their Antivirus i was hopeless for something more crappy that would keep me busy ,good luck to somebody that will decide to use it ...maybe i can give you my phone # already ;) It WILL block a lot of apps that you WANT to use (even those that dont need an internet access !!!), slow down the system a lot (like their Antivirus) and I have seen it blocking the internet access on many systems without a reason (no viruses or major spyware detected). The build in Windows firewall does a much better work and stay away from this product as far as you can..."
1,NO TECH SUPPORT,"At all unless you want to pay 30-60 dollars if their ""protective"" system wont remove it.. Now I think I will look for a virus protection system with actual tech support.. Don't know about McAfeeand have herd negative about them but they do offer free online chat help at least> the below have free phone support: Trend Micro PC-cillin Internet Security 2005 got number one ratings on consumer repots however I don't know how much that says since Norton got second place.....It's amazing if you go look at reviews here [...] You will find most people are not pleased with their antivirus programs and makes it appear almost as if antivirus programs are nothing but problems in general LOL, but anyways thus far PC-cillin Internet Security 2005 looks the best."
1,1 un-earned star thanks to the ranking system,"I would have given it zero stars if I could. This is simple something that does not work. I used NIS 2002, 2003, 2004, and this week upgrade from 2004 to 2005.After the 'upgrade', the network printer no longer works, which can be fixed by 'disabling' the NIS. I knew I blocked an 'incoming' port related to print spool, but had no clue why it blocked my outgoing printing jobs. Anyway, it's still a fixable problem. The unfixable problem for me is the POP3/SMTP. After the 'upgrade' the POP3/SMTP for Outlook Express only works for one time after each reboot. Then it just time out on any other attempts. Diabling the NIS 2005 did not help.In addition, this things starts up really slow.PS: After removing the 'parental and privacy controls', EMail works again. So this is just another typical of the thingy works for half of its customers."
1,Slow and Buggy With No Customer Support,"Rather than becoming more mature, software installation, operation and support problems have been increasing each of the 10 years I have used Norton internet security products. Installation went smoothly. However, once installed, the program would not allow ""Outlook Explorer"" to connect to the internet to send/receive email. Trying to get help from Symantecs customer support was futile. I solved the problem by disabling Norton's firewall and turning on the firewall included in Windows XP. In addition to the incompatability problems it had with Microsoft software, the program caused my computer to come to a crawl because of its demands on the system. Stay away from Internet Security 2005 unless you want hours of frustration with no support from Symantec."
1,Don't Buy this Software,"Cannot activate, have spent over 16 hours and purchased two separate disks to try to do so. Support is now outsourced to India, and first time I spoke with them, the person barely understood English and definately did not comprehend my problem. Second time, their solution was to replace the disk (for the third time) which I declined. Their supervisor promised to have someone call me back in 24 hours. Did not happen. Symantec obviously does not care about their American customers. So why support them?"
2,"A disaster compounded by incompetent ""support""","My new HP computer came with a 60-day trial version of this software. A few days before expiration, I got the message that I needed to renew my antivirus subscription, which I did. The subscription key, however, doesn't work. Despite multiple exchanges of emails and reports on the Symantec site, the antivirus module still doesn't work, the software refuses to recognize the subscription key, my email is hit or miss, and the firewall issues blocking internet connectivity are a nightmare. Symantec won't or can't solve the problem, and won't issue a refund. Avoid it like the plague"
1,What a waste of money,"This software is a bunch of crap. All we had were viruses; and yes, we did install it as it was intended to be. Trojans, worms, you name it; we had it. Don't waste your money. If there was an option of 0 stars, that's what I would give it. Hopefully I can return it to Wal-mart"
1,COMPUTER CRASHED,"Within hours after downloading Norton 2005 Internet Security Anti Virus and Firewall, my computer crashed and is non-operational. It will not even boot up. I did receive a refund but now I have no computer."
2,More Time Fixing Glitches than What NIS is Supposed to Save in Virus Protection,"I've had NIS on my PC for about 6 months and ever since I installed it I've had problems accessing my XP user accounts and the internet. It slows down my system in the boot up, web surfing and shut down process. I've tried reinstalling it and although it's a little better it still prevents me from downloading files or installing new programs (like Yahoo music engine). My children can't access any of their web sites when logged into their XP account (like Nick Jr. or Disney.com) which is due to NIS's parental control but even when I turn NIS off they still can't access them. I'm going to uninstall it and start using Microsoft's new free security programs which is the configuration I have on my laptop and it works much better."
1,won't grow,"we followed the directions, watered, watched, and after 4 weeks, nothing. I am so disappointed. I will try contacting the manufacturer for more seeds. Complete waste of my time."
1,"wow, a lot of driving to get nowhere","this book should be read by all people contemplating suicide because by theend of the 2nd chapter, you'll be reaching for the pill bottle.this piece is a good argument for why the 1st amendment shouldn't apply to everyone"
5,INCREDIBLE LIVE ALBUM !!!!,"And Gary's first.The songs are welcome variations to those of the studio versions.Richer in texture and less agressive,especially on the guitar parts,maybe approaching the style of the album they were presenting at the time PLEASURE PRINCIPLE.This was a bit of a letdown to my punk and heavy metal mentality,used as I am to live versions being faster and rawer,but this is another kind of music and I take it at face value,and it's EXCELLENT.Even Bombers is presented with nice arabian synth licks.The sound is incredibly dinamic,very bass heavy,and the Sharpley/Gardiner rhyhtm section is up front in the mix all along the 85'+.It's a bit synth-weak as I'd heard before I bought the record,but as good as live recordings got by late 70's."
5,grateful,"I am grateful the teachings are opened to the whole world.This is a choice of book I made from the heart and it is now becoming part of me.The voice with which it is written, and I only have begun to read the first part, is gentle and clear to me.What a gift !"
5,Must-read retelling of the classic Aesop fable,"Richly illustrated, imaginative retelling of the classic Aesop fable of perseverance, set in the Sonoran Desert. The fun and lovely pictures are full of actual native flora and fauna.It's a must-read for any desert-dwelling child, or to supplement study on desert habitats, or for that child who needs a bit of encouragement to keep on keepin' on."
5,Best Ice Cream Scoop on the market,"In my high school years, I worked at an ice cream shop that had these scoops. I just took it for granted that all scoops were the same. I love ice cream and had been using the cheap scoops, with the thumb type extractor, even ones that look similar to the Zeroll. I could never get the ice cream to look like I did back in the day. I finally broke down and purchased the Zeroll, even though it cost 25 bucks 15 years ago at an up scale kitchen goods store. That by far has been one of the best kitchen tools that I have owned and it looks almost as good as the day I bought it! I would never use any other type of scoop and would highly recommend you buy one."
4,"Works surprisingly well, just wish it was a little longer.","It very effectively transfers heat to the scoop portion, and ice cream doesn't stick either. Very sturdy, but lots of times one's hand gets into a container."
5,Perfect!,It cuts through ice cream easily even if the ice cream is too frozen. The handle allows you to get a good grip.
3,Not as good as Pampered Chef,"I was looking for a replacement of my Pampered Chef ice cream scoop which I loved so much but made the mistake of sticking it in the washer...! This one doesn't work as well as the one from Pampered Chef, as I still need to put some force to scoop the ice cream AND shake it off. With the other one I had, I didn't need any force and it slipped right off of the scoop into the bowl. I may have to source the one from Pampered Chef after all."
4,A very good scoop indeed,"Easily the best scoop I've used and its ability to roll up hard ice cream is impressive. Scooping soft ice cream is effortless, and scooping hard ice cream can still require some effort. (It works great but it's not ""magical"".) Due to the way it's designed to work, it does seem to melt the outer layer of the ice cream that's been in contact with the scoop. It's best to not pick up the scoop until you're ready to scoop and then scoop quickly."
4,Hidden gem,"We've had several scoops and this one seems to have all of best features tied together. Its ergonomic and has a nice, large scoop that's sturdy and sharp enough to get through everything. We've found it helps to run it under hot water for a few seconds. The heat feature really retains the warmth.. and it sears through the hardest/coldest ice cream like noneother.. and we've owned a lot of them. And the price and uniqueness of all of this makes it a really great gift!"
4,"I was going to buy a PS2 for GT4, not anymore","I love the XBOX. I was planning on buying a PS2 solely to play GT3 and 4. Not anymore. I love this game! Tons of cars and tracks. Tons of upgrades. You can customize your car to look however you want. You can add your own soundtracks. Good sound and graphics. There are no stupid license tests. There are plenty of adjustments to make the game as easy or as hard as you can handle. The only thing I dont like is that you cannot adjust the sensitivity. The steering, throttle, and braking is a little touchy. It is difficult to make slight turns. It is also difficult to keep high powered, rear wheel drive cars from peeling out and turning sideways (suped up vette or mustang). It is now my favorite racing game. Better than anything I have played on Xbox or PS2."
1,Don't call Vivitar to help your kids use camera!!,"Although this is a fairly simple camera, we could not figure out to to record video clips without being hooked to the computer. My grandson emailed to vivitar 2 times with no response. Phone calls sit on terminal hold! The instructions do not explain usage..We still have not figured this out and I feel I am a fairly intelligent person. And to top it off, it takes lousy still pictures."
2,Not impressed,I was disappointed with the book because the pictures that were available did not make the food look enticing and that the recipes seemed blah.
4,Good cookbook,"While not of the caliber of Betty Crocker's International Cookbook, which is awesome, this is a good chinese cookbook for the basics of chinese cooking. Good pictures."
1,Didn't work with dlink di-524,"Did a little bit of research before I bought this product, but obviously should have done more. After trying to learn how to set this up in repeater mode with the documentation supplied I went to the web. Surprise, surprise, dlink's site had different documentation. Bottom line is that the dwl-g700ap does not work in repeater mode with di-524 despite being advertised as working with the di-524 on dlink's website. This info is only available from tech support and even then it's like pulling teeth. Since they could tell me which wap's would work with the di-524, but not which routers would work with the dwl-g700ap, I'm guessing that this product may not work as a repeater at all."
5,D-Link is great.,"I have had this product for over 6 years. I recently bought a Linksys G router to replace this one, but Linksys died just after 6 months. I then had to use my old D-Link again. I now will upgrade to a N router, and one thing is sure that I will never ever waste my money on a Linksys. D-Link is the one since other stuff such as D-Link USB hub I have still work after so many years of usage."
5,D-Link is okay with me...,"i ordered this because i recently built a laptop and i wanted to be able to connect to my network without having to be tied down by a cable. my current network is hard wired, so i needed an access point. i stayed with D-Link since my router is D-Link. the only difficulty i had with this device was properly setting up the security for the wireless port. no worries at all otherwise. i barely had to look at the user manual. i plugged it into the wall, connected to the router, enabled my laptops wireless port and boom, off i went. i did not have to upgrade the firmware as i did on the router. overall, i am very happy with this product so far."
1,Not really good for a yoga class,"As an instructor, I found this music to be too fast and energetic. I was disappointed."
2,Unwatchable DVD quality,"Leaving aside the bumbling Watson played by Nigel Bruce, this release is unwatchable because of the poor transfer. It looks like someone used an old camcorder to videotape a television set with a shaky arm in a dark room. Why pay a premium for DVDs that don't look any better than VHS?I'll give it two stars, and that's fair compensation for the horrid quality. One star for the 15 hours of radio broadcasts, and another for the DVD cover art: it's sensational in the best tradition of pulp fiction.Given FOCUSfilm's poor reputation, I would steer away from anything they produce, for example:Our Town"
1,Sadly the Pits,Horrible video and audio quality with huge gaps in Terror By Night. What a waste. Save your money on this one.
1,Disappointing!,"I passed on purchasing VHS versions of the Sherlock Holmes movies, looking to the promise of DVD. Well, I should have purchased VHS. The picture quality is beneath the quality of the movies (very faded and washed out, sound is no better) and many scenes have been cut completely out, making it difficult to follow the plots. Save your money, wait for someone else to release DVD's worthly of this great series of movies."
1,Foul Language in book!,"Kids book with dammit on pg 51. Why does a kids book need this language? Glad I read it before giving it to my son, was enjoying the storyline before that and not sure what other swear words are in it."
5,Very uplifting,"This is my first album by Chris Tomlin and I love it. I was introduced to him from his Amazing grace (my chains are gone) track and was immediately hooked. Usually, I end up enjoying less than half the tracks on any given CD but this one was overall good enough for me to like most of the tracks save one or two. Besides Amazing Grace, my top picks from this album would be in no particular order: How Can I Keep From Singing, Glory in the highest, Let your mercy rain and Made to worship."
5,How can we keep from Praising?,"This is a special man with a desire to see God glorified. Truly, How can we ever Praise God enough? The music is inviting and the Spirit brings a flood of praise behind it. I am a worshipper and sense that same heart behind this music. This stuff helps me focus my sights on higher ground."
3,It's okay...,I bought this cd after hearing a song on NPR. The cd was not nearly as good as I thought it would be. It lacks depth and emotion and in some places ends up sounding a bit one dimensional.Not bad for long car trips or if you just want basic back ground music- but not the soul stirring sound I was looking for.
3,An Short Review From A Fan Of The Series,"I have purchased the previous Fired Up! releases in the past and haven't had a single complaint on them until now. This CD, Fired Up! 3, is the worse of them all. There are 18 total songs on the CD and I'd say about 13 of them are good. I don't hate this CD, don't get me wrong, it's just that they try to turn to many slow songs into a fast moving techno song. My favorite track on the CD is number 9, ""Into The Groove"" by Mad' house. I mean seriously, how can you turn Christina Aguileras ""Beautiful"" into a techno song. Anyways, I'd recommend the CD if you like techno because like I said, half is AWESOME and half is CRAP."
2,VERY basic general knowledge text suitable for laypersons,"This outdated and elementary overview of cranes and rigging is directed toward aspiring beginner-level operators and laypersons and was written at a grade-school level. Garby's text has just undergone a badly needed update: be sure you purchase the newer version. Full of ""rules of thumb"" that raise doubts as to what references are being used.Professional operators should use their crane manufacturer's manuals, ASME B30 standards, and applicable Federal, State, and Local regulations as references."
1,Bury This Book. . . . Please!,"Steal this book and bury it! However, I wouldn't want to be caught with this book tucked under my arm. Truthfully speaking, this is not even a good book to place on your coffee table or in the bathroom. It is that bad!""Come Along to Italy"" is an out-of-date travel guide; it is not current. It wasn't any good 30 years ago either! This book is so bad that when the author tried to donate it to the high school library in 1973, it refused to accept the book (true story, no kidding).Indeed, I urge you to travel to Italy. It is a country rich in culture, beauty, art, heritage, and history. However, don't read Franco Di Domenica's book before going. This would only confuse, rather than enlighten, you. Believe me, there are other more current and reliable sources for you to use as a travel / reference guide. . . . like the internet."
4,Misleading,"This product is missleading. It shows that there are two bottles on the picture but they only send you one, guess I should of read the product information, o well"
3,Its ok,I like the pedometer but don't think the body fat analyzer on it is very correct because it differs a lot from what my doctor's tell me.
3,plastic,"This recoil starter is plastic not metal and broke off the machine the second day we tried to start it. I was not impressed, but now I have some extra recoil rope kicking around."
3,An ok read,"I don't believe this is Dennis Smith's best work. I have read both ""Report from Engine 82"" and ""Report from Ground Zero"" and they were excellent books. While some of the stories were quite compelling and interesting to hear about how things use to be, some of the stories were repetative and boring. It wasn't a totally bad book and ok to get if you get it cheap, but there are definately better reads out there."
1,fails the basic test of literature,"Stories about the historical oppression and continual discrimination against Aborigines should be told, but it is unfortunate that Morgan is one of those to do it. The book fails as literature simply because it is boring and very poorly written. As such, it does nothing to advance the Aboriginal cause here in Australia, and unfortunately, plays right into the hands of the redneck Hansonites and their views of white racial superiority."
2,Bad movie,"I trashed this from my movie library, it was that boring. If you check other reviews, you'll see they also have the same rating."
5,Excellent resource for Marriage and Family Therapists!,"Mr. Betchen writes prolifically regarding this topic! It is poignant, with a very useful chapter on the 'how to's' of treating the Pursuer-Distancer dynamic. I wish I had this in my earlier years of training/education. I am now a believer in needing to have sex therapy education coupled with my marriage and family therapy skills to make more of an impact for my clients. This idea has unfortunately been missed in all my time in school and in the field. Outstanding reading!"
5,the reigning queen of animated comedy,"Fleischer Studios were Disney's most prevalent rivals in the 1930s, and these cartoons prove why. Betty Boop is the most surreal comedy cartoon available, all hinging on beautifully fluid animation. Although some of the comedy is subtly sexual and sadly racist, you can still view it objectively as a product of its time. For animation of this high a caliber to come out this early on is a miracle. Every episode is paneled upon underlying swing and jazz music, so everything flows and has a steady rhythm to it. The comedy is crazy and hilarious, utilizing slapstick to its full potential. This collection collects the bulk of what you can find of Betty Boop cartoons (over 40 cartoons).Just note the ones starring Pudgy are pretty boring, so you might need to skip them."
5,"""Alternate"" lunchbox","I've watched only two cartoons so far, so will leave the reviews to other posters. I did want to mention the existence of an alternate Betty Boop lunchbox, which I bought tonight at a local discount store. See my pictures above. It contains the same two Betty Boop DVD's but no case for permanently storing them, and no keychain. It includes four additional ""TV Cartoon Classics"" DVD's (two single-sided disks and one double-sided disk). Sadly, these don't include the two PD Betty Boop cartoons missing from the main set, ""On With the New"" and ""Whoops! I'm a Cowboy"". I don't know if anyone on Amazon is selling this version, but if you see one in a B&M store that mentions ""TV Cartoon Classics"" on the back panel, keep in mind it's not the same as what's listed here."
2,expencive and useless,"connected via fiber optic cable to sea and sea dx 8000 camera it does not work. only god knows when it does flash and when it does not. no matter what your camera and/or strobe settings are, result is unpredictable.i like the target light. so i use it as extremely expencive underwater flashlight."
5,Love it!!,Love how I can plug this direct into an outlet. No cords hanging or strung out to trip or catch on anything.
4,Good season,There is no doubt why ER has been on so long. Not my favorite season on dvd but good nonetheless.
2,not for me,"I was hoping for some insight from this book that I could use in our Internet company. Possibly it was my error in purchasing it. The author shares his thoughts and gives history, but it did not provoke any thoughts for me nor provide much value. If you are into the toy industry or the discussion of theory, it might be a good buy. If you have looking for ideas or inspiration, I'd recommend you try elsewhere."
1,Don't buy this book,The 'full color section' was a fabrication. Many of the pages in the book look like somebody printed them off from their home computer. I feel cheated.
5,Great for Children!!!,"If you Children love the American Wiggles and singing and dancing, they will love this. My children are 3 and 6 and they love to watch XuXa on Globo Tv. I would highly recommend this for anyone, whether they are Brazilian or if they have no other reason, it will introduce their small children to other languages. If you Buy the Circo DVD you can have English captions put on the tv to help teach the children what they are singing about. 10 thumbs up I love it they love it"
4,A wonderful yoga experience,"When I first received Yoga with Ateeka, I watched it and was a little surprised to find her demonstrating yoga postures on the roots of a giant bodie tree!!! But then when I actually tried the tape, a really enjoyed it, and I felt great afterward. My only complaint is that there are a couple of areas where the camera becomes very slightly unsteady, probably due to the ocean wind, but maybe I'm being overly critical. Overall, I'd say it's definitely a keeper!"
1,almost all puzzles are the same,"Seems at least 75 percent of all the puzzles are of the same category - where there are statements which may or may not be true.Many of his other puzzle books are also just as filled, if not more so, by endless knights and knaves, that is, non-liars and liars.I don't need more than just a few of that type of puzzle.The few puzzles I did find interesting were not the author's own, but traditional known ones.How greatly disappointing that an author could just keep filling his books with such similar material."
4,Chauncey Wright,"I particularly enjoyed this book, because I'm a great fan of Charles Peirce, and Wright thinks along the same lines and was part of his group."
4,Learning Notation Backwards,"If you know Bill's drumming, this book can be a real eye-opener. If you don't, the notated examples can be intimidating -- but they may lead you to buy some challenging and original music.I'll be honest and say I got this strictly for entertainment. It wound being more useful than I thought. I was never much of a sight-reader, but seeing the parts as I listened to them gave me some insight into drum notation.Bill's written insight into the music is good enough to make you wish for an autobigraphy - or at least some ongoing music criticism. There are also enough ancedotes to dissuade anyone from wanting to make a living out of playing orginal music! I reccommmend this unconditionally for drummers and ""proggies""."
4,Love to see this film again!,"I saw this movie at a Saturday afternoon matinee when I was just a kid in my early teens and I remember very much enjoying it, but as I say, I was just a kid! In retrospect it probably wasn't a particularly good film (dispite having some great music), but that doesn't mean it still wouldn't be fun to see again as a sort of cult classic. I mean hey, Phantom Of The Paradise with Paul Williams got released on DVD... Son Of Dracula CAN'T be any worse!! And if memory serves me correctly, Who drummer Keith Moon has a cameo in Son Of Dracula playing drums on ""Jump Into The Fire"" during the party scene. Release this film on DVD!"
3,"Good characters, but a predictable ending.","This book had excellent characters; I really enjoyed meeting Liam, Fanuilh, Coeccias, and the lesser characters, too. Unfortunately, it didn't make a good mystery. I knew how it was going to end from the moment Liam met the killer."
4,Excellent,"This book was very well written, all of the activities that transpired during WWII are an amazing read. The stories and players involved were more than I had really known. A very interesting read."
1,AVOID !,"This book is a rehash of an earlier book offered by the author's now extinct website/subscription-service. It is simplistic, repetitive and wrong. Avoid."
2,Disappointing taste and texture,"These weren't even that good with a glass of milk. My family says they are ""hollow in the middle"". They are dry and not very tasty. If you want a cookie that isn't as bad for you as the mainstream commercial brands, pick a day when you have some time and make your own cookies. You can control the ingredients (substitute some of the all purpose flour with whole grain flour, use non hydrogenated margarine, cut back on the sugar, etc) and the end product will taste 10x better. Two stars are for the trans fat they are lacking, and for mostly natural ingredients."
2,Not Bad But Not Great,"These are OK but not particularly tasty. The package portions are handy. Especially because of Amazon's offering only the large quantity for purchase at one time, though, I most likely will not order them again."
2,There's a better Jessie James Book,"I have read countless books on Jessie James including this book. The best book however is 'I Jessie James' by his grandson who was a judge in California. The book places you right in Jessie's head as you ride with him through his short life. You learn some of the family secrets including the fact that Jessie was the only outlaw to this day(besides his brother Frank)in the James family. Jessie James was a religious man destined to be a preacher like his father. The civil war ended his childhood and after the war, all southern rebels were declared outlaws and banned from working any trade or joining a church by the state of Missouri. Yet, northern rebels were granted a pardon. Jessie had little choice but to become an outlaw on the run the rest of his life."
1,Overly Hyped,"I found this book to be overly hyped. Many of the so-called ""discoveries"" were already surfaced in other books, most of which had limited small or Univ. press runs. It is well written. My guess is that the other reviewers are new to the James story matter, acting like this is the greatest book on the subject. And as for accuracy, Stiles has a man killed during the Russellville, Kentucky robbery of 1868, when there were NO fatalities. Some people want to believe real hard that this book is what the hypemeisters claim it to be. It is not a balanced account, I'm sorry. The author glosses over Jayhawker and Union Militia ""death squads"" to make Jesse James into a larger than life villain. Most of the letters attributed to Jesse [their authorship has ALWAYS been in question] do not mention anything political but are alibis given for non-participation in a given robbery."
3,Decent K-Horror Film,"Cello is a decent ghost story. It's not that the acting is bad or the production values are low, it's that the film is really predictable, at least to me it was. One thing I love about Asian horror is that they show things that American film won't touch. I won't give any spoilers but you'll know what I'm talking about when you see the film. Overall, good acting, good cinematography and a good story. It's a shame I figured out the ending about halfway through. Nothing groundbreaking but not a bad film."
2,Jordan Talbot,"I read Food: A Culinary History it was a required text for a culinay history class in which am currently enrolled in. I read the book and thought it had a lot of good information in it that could really help, but I think if the book was not poorly written it would be a lot more enjoyable. I only read the book becuase it was a required text. If it was not a required text, I would of set the book down after the first couple of pages. I think the information in this book gives it the potential to be a very good book and could one day be very helpful, but it needs to be completely rewritten."
3,good,"The book has good content and great detil. It is a must readfor any person that want to learn where the food came from andhow it got there. The only bad thing, is the book was kind ofhard to understand at some part. Overall is a great book."
3,Model railroading for the more advanced hobbiest,"I am a beginner at the hobby of Model Railroading, and find that this book is set up for the more advanced modeler! I just wanted to have some ideas on how to lay track and some designs. But it goes way to far in what a beginner who just wants to set up a train track, and take it down for the next time. So of all the track designs, I only found one that appealed to my needs of making a coffee table design for my Z-Scale train set. And the book has a number of redundancies under different names and locations. I recommend ""48 Top Notch Track Plans"" as one for the beginner, as it has plans and how to make the Benchwork as well, and also...""Subterrain Manual by Woodland Scenics"". It shows how to set up your Styrofoam track risers and inclines for various Scale track, and the percentage of incline per foot of travel, and inches of rise for each percent of rise."
4,Good work pant,"These jeans are THICK and DURABLE by no means stylish but they are a perfect jean for working in construction, HVAC or anything like that."
1,Wrong size =(,"I buy this item, and recived him. But! I see item wrong size, i need 32x34, but i receved 34x32. It's very bad, poor seller. I can't have any idea ""what do if this?"". I'm in Russia, and back send have a lot money.And some word about item: This item have a hard denim, ideal for work (but size :( )."
1,did not wash well,When I washed these jeans they became very wrinkled and when i dried them they looked even worse! They are still wrinkled after ironing them. I was not happy with them at all!!!
2,Yeah... they're rigid,"I had no idea that fabric could be this stiff. They remind me of those uncomfortable tough jeans from when I was a kid except I think these are stiffer.I had to wash and dry them 5 or 6 times before they could be worn - just kept cycling them through with other loads of laundry. Even with all that washing, they are still stiff but they can be worn.The cut is very full. I thought they would shrink up more than they did. It probably would have been a good idea for me to order an inch smaller than normal in the waist.So -They are ok.They are more rigid than I'd like.They will probably wear well and last a long time.They will be worn, but I wouldn't want to purchase another pair of these."
3,Not like the picture shown,The picture of these jeans is misleading. The real color is a brighter blue and the seams are stitched with an awful bright-yellow thread. I ended up returning these.
3,Doesn't look as good in person.,These shoes are much more pointer in person and not in a classy pointy look. They are comfortable for heels but thats about it.
3,Good Strap but to short,Overall I like this strap however I find myself not using it because it is to short. I was hoping for a strap that I could have over my neck and shoulder and still be able to take a picture without have to take it off. If it were not for the length I would recommend it.
4,How to demystify those southern women,"This book was mentioned in a book about Molly Ivins. I knew I had to have it for my Yankee sister who recently moved south, where ""Bless your heart"" doesn't mean what it does in our neck of the woods."
4,FROM THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD--LIVES.,"THE STAGE WORKS OF JANACEK ARE AMONG HIS FINEST CREATIONS. THE PROPER SETTING, CAST AND STAGING, ARE IMPERATIVE TO BRING THE COMPOSERS VISION TO FRUITION. THESE FACTORS AND MORE ARE PRESENT IN THE PRESENT DVD. BOULEZ BRINGS A SENSE OF CLARITY AND REFINEMENT TO THIS PRODUCTION THAT GIVES THIS SOMBER WORK GREAT VITALITY AND UNDERSTANDING.WELL DONE."
4,I've had fun with this,I've used this book for both my children. The only I would like better is if the binding were made to accomodate more stuff. I put in a lot of pictures and the book is looking really fat.
1,Winnie the Pooh Gift Set (123's/ABC's),"The only thing of any real value in this gift set, are the flash cards. However they in no way justify the price. Disney proves itself once again to be extremely disinterested in children's education, if not down right working against it."
3,Disappointed,"I was very impressed with the ease of placing the order and the delivery time. However, the quality of the product was substandard. There us a very small but still visible crease along the center of the poster.I am keeping it because I don't want the hassle of returning it but I will not order from the company again."
4,Unsuitable for monks,"On pretext of moral indoctrination you 'll witness a medley of sin, passion, wreckless youth and stimulating situations that defies the sensorship of its time. Enjoy it!"
4,We love this bed,"We have two of these for our 3 year old twins. They have been in them for about two years and have enjoyed being silly in them during the day, yet have no trouble getting into them at bedtime to sleep. They are a great sturdy bed that neither have had a problem falling out of as we did when we tried a ""traditional"" toddler bed."
3,My son is climbing all over this bed!,"We received this as a Christmas gift for our then 21 month-old son. He really enjoys the bed and it made transitioning from the crib to bed pretty easy. Our son is now over 2 and he climbs on top of his bed and jumps through the hole all when he is supposed to be sleeping! He also pushs it across his room and uses it as a ladder to get on top of his changing table, which is very unsafe! If I could pick a bed, I would not pick one that he can climb on top of. In fact, I'm looking for a boring wood toddler bed right now. I also don't like changing the sheets, it is very hard to get inside the bed and change the sheet. Additionally, the adult can't sit on the bed to read stories or cuddle. We have to sit on the floor during story time.Overall, I think there are better toddler beds out there!"
2,Quite deceiving...,"I've ordered this padded water bottle together with the MAS Harnass belt, and I've been quite disappointed how it looks like in reality - cheap plastic, which even doesn't give confidence enough to try it."
3,not as pictured,"it was not as pictured. it did not have a top cover, which lets the sun heat up the water here in arizona."
5,Surprising fun!,"Whether or not you are a mystery fan, you will not be able to resist this unique new book. The author mixes an ironic sense of humor with fun, engaging characters, making the book hard to put down. Resolving the mystery is what keeps the story speeding ahead, but the warmth and humor is what you'll take with you. I'm eagerly awaiting the next entry in a promised series of ""Aaron Tucker mysteries."""
4,Interesting Document- Rerelease,"The man who preceeded Babtunde Olatunji in introducing America to African drumming! A rerelease of a 30+ year old album. It's still fresh & interesting with skillful & creative use of donno, atumpan, kpanlogo/conga and fontomfrom. Warren (now called Ghanaba) uses a mix of African drums (from the Ashanti, Dogomba, and Ga peoples of Ghana) arranged & played like a jazz drumset. He incorporates bastardized African rhythms in the context of African-esque and dated Western-sounding song forms. About 1/2 of the album is of great interest (inspring subsequent listenings) & 1/2 is trite. A lovely document of a jazz pioneer that is too often forgotten. Hopefully they'll release Ghanaba's earlier & more recent albums as well!"
4,Love the Doc,I have seen the doc on numerous occasions and have finally bought his wonderful cookbook. Even though the recipes are low in fat they taste great--which I was afraid that they would not. I highly recommend buying Dr. Collins book and bringing it to the dinner table.
3,"Good, but not great","This is the third Tess Monaghan novel I've read and I don't think it compares well with Ms. Lippman's earlier work. Crow is an annoying character. It is hard to understand how Tess even tolerates him. While reading it I kept thinking how two-dimensional he is. A 1960s hippie-wannabe who doesn't seem to understand how the world works. It also bothered me that by the end of the book there were still a couple of unresolved plot twists. Ms. Lippman is an excellent writer and her style and pacing kept me interested enough to move through the book in a single sitting. Because of her writing ability I'm looking forward to reading her latest novel, ""What the Dead Know."" At least I know I won't have to put up with Crow in that one. (It is a stand alone book, not part of the Monaghan series."
2,"Not so much, Crow","I love this series, but I didn't like reading this one from Crow's point of view. I just don't find him that interesting."
3,OK but not great,"I just got this ratchet, and haven't used it yet, so this is just my 1st impression. The tool looks ok but I am not overly impressed with the workmanship, but what can you expect from china? My main complaint so far is the instruction manual is one of the most useless I have ever seen. I went to their website and there was no help there, just the same material that came with the tool. It's like they wanted to write it in 100 words or less."
2,Snore...............,"Making fun of the self help books- snore. I remember seeing jokes on the late show years ago which did the same thing. I suppose if you've had your head in the sand for the last decade and just recently discovered the self help section, you'll find this book a scream. Otherwise, no."
3,"Nice pictures, lightweight text","This short book offers a non-technical introduction to the question of finding life beyond the Earth. Chapters review the basics of our solar system and others (concluding that there is nothing special about ours), the probability of life elsewhere, scientific searches for extraterrestrial life and intelligence, and, very briefly, interstellar flight. There is a heavy emphasis on full page visual images, many of them artists' conceptions. I would rank the book one star higher if it did not claim that Io is Jupiter's largest moon, a glaring error."
4,good detail,I gave it 4 stars becauses its just a figure. It does have good detail and will be a good addition to my collection.
2,Not sticky at all,"Save your money and avoid buying this. My hands and feet slip on the mat, and it does not stick to the floor either. I also smell solvent each time I'm in child's pose. ATAFA only gives you 14 days from delivery date, (don't know if that's leaving their warehouse, or arrival at your place), for returns."
4,A good solid Shotgun approach to the basics,"I have been performing and choreographing staged combat for about tewlve years now and have read several books on the subject. For a beginner this is definately the best place to start. Mr. Lane does skimp on the hand fighting to focus on single sword techniques, and presents as fact a few professional judgements with which I would disagree. The amount of space devoted to the katas seems to be filler. These are all minor points. The book is a good solid base to start from and all fight directors should have it in their library, and all beginners should consider reading it."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"As the title says, this is the novelisation of the first Star Trek movie. The enterprise crew has a new member who disagrees with Kirk about how things, should be run.On a mission, they come across a strange woman and a machine that calls itself V'ger - part of which is the old Voyager probe."
4,Great Seat,"This seat is large enough that my husband is comfortable on it, it has 2 bolts on the hinges on each side so it's more durable (we have a problem with the hinges not staying in place), it cute and the most comfortable seat I've ever sat on.This seat will make you keep the toilet clean, and I trust a previous review that said the hinges rusted so I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars."
4,I recommend this item.,"This toilet seat is very nice looking, durable and good for the price. It is also very easy to install. My bathroom is black and white. It matches perfectly. I think it would match just about any color sceme."
2,You get what you pay for,The shoe was fine for about a week or two and then the sole broke down on the inside of the shoe. The sole seperated from the rest of the shoe and fell down creating a hole. This caused a lot of discomfort when walking.I wouldn't purchase these again.
3,Looks good but not very comfortable,"The shoes looks great but it is not exactly as comfortable as I hope to be. The shoe is very light but does not fit my feet well and support is kind of poor design. I had shoes which are much more comfortable. I guess for the price I paid, it is OK."
1,Fluffer Nutter Wisdom - Lacks Practical Advice,"This book does not stand out in any fashion other than as a forum for the author to show off his anecdotal tales of philosophy and finance.I found nothing concrete to implement for my investment style. And the exercises to expand my ""mental boundries"" for unique thinking, seemed like rehashed, rhetorical self-help.There was little correlation between the title and the content; again reminding us that one should not judge a book by it's cover."
1,School book which I never read,I hate when professors make you buy a book and then don't even reference it.
4,A Redneck Lawyer Goes Country,"As this writer has often mentioned on our pages of AngryCountry, we get all types of artists' albums for review. This particular album came by my desk enclosed with a simple note that read, ""Help me! I don't wanna be a redneck lawyer any more."" Needless to say, I got a chuckle out of that line; but hey, it was one way to get my attention!Upon listening to Tod Barrett's album, ""The Tod Barrett Project"", what I found was not the greatest vocalist. But what was lacking in vocals was made up for in lyrics. Clearly this is, indeed, a lawyer who has seen people at the worst times of their lives. From their heartache with the court system, Tod has taken that pain and put it into the best of country songs and complied it into an album that is pure traditional country music at its best."
3,Arthur's Computer Disaster,"""Arthur's Computer Disaster"" was a cute book. Any child would enjoy it. It's not only an easy reader that they would like reading, but it teaches a lesson. -What happens when your break the rules.Arthur's hooked on this new computer game. His mom tells him not to play it while she's gone, but he does it anyway, even with his sister, D.W., warning him. Arthur accidently ""breaks"" the computer, his mother gets home, and punishes him. All in all, he learns a lesson.D.W. is my favorite character, because she's so sweet and innocent, just like all little sisters are. She warns her brother, and he chooses not to listen, and ends up ""breaking"" the computer."
2,sort of...,"Our old male cat had the run of the house for years. Then just recently I started closing the door to our bedroom at night because I couldn't take all the wake-ups of us and our baby. (We also have a toddler, but I managed to get through the infant days without closing the door at night.) That's when the peeing on the bed started, so it was definitely a territory issue. I tried this spray in conjunction with the the diffuser. For one week, no peeing. Then the peeing started again. And it has happened several times since, so now the door stays closed during the day again. Too bad. I think the spray have some effect, but not enough."
1,Controls are sadistic at best.,"The graphics are ok. The controls are nearly impossible. Not worth the time to learn them anyway. One hand on the mouse another on the keyboard hunting and pecking away. Far to much hassle. In first person mode, you control point of veiw via the mouse. In a hurry, it resembles something between a seizure and falling down a flight of stairs. Dont buy it."
2,ES MEJOR ROGUE SPEAR.,"No tiene buenos graficos y la interfase con Windows no es de lo mejor, tiene varias limitantes como juego de accion y estrategia, no te lo recomiendo, a menos que quieras enviar tu dinero a la basura."
5,"The Game is Great, a little old.","This game is great , it was made afew years ago.The cut scenes are kind of old looking. But over all the game is great. The gold pack has both Rainbow Six and Mission Pack Eagle Watch. If you have the Rouge Spear and Mission Pack Urban Operations, and you want all the games you should get this. If you have the Rouge Spear or any of the other games you will not like the game as much, but you'll still like it."
5,Great game,"This game is awesome! The graphics, controls, and plot to game are great. It has a great selection of weapons, missions, and accesories. It is very realistic and a great addition to your Rainbow 6 collection."
3,"Interesting, but just OK -",This was a book where the title intrigued me - the meat was not what I had anticipated by the subtitle.
5,Awesome Cat Bed,"I set this cat bed up the moment I received it. Placed 1 kitty on it to show her the bird feeder outside the window and haven't left it since. I have two cats, 1 pretty large and the other only about 9 months old. They jump, play and cuddle here all the time. Great investment, I run a vacuum over it to get the hair off. The little bolster is a great idea so when they tumble aroudn they don't fall off."
5,"Iraq: Been There, Done That -- An Inside View!","Boy, I certainly enjoyed this book. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat as you relive his experiences in Iraq and with GEN Schwarzkopf during the Gulf War.With his unique first-hand experiences in Iraq and the Middle East and being fluent in Arabic, Col. Francona has certainly had a most exciting career. I'm sure he must still be an extremely valuable consultant to the Bush administration in Washington.This is the best book I've read in quite some time!"
5,Fast instant pictures that are sharp!,"I love the Polaroid Spectra 1200SI instant film camera because it develops so quickly with sharp professional results. The camera is very easy to use.A lever on the right pops open the film cartridge door. Simply slip the cartridge with the two silver contacts pointing down and close the door. The black cover which prevents light from entering the film comes out immediately.A lever on the left pops up the camera lens, sonar Autofocus sensor and flash very conveniently. Simply pull the lever and push the top down to protect the lens.This is a very advanced camera where the viewfinder has a digital distance reading and a warning when not to take a picutre.The control panel has all the controls of a dream Polaroid camera. This camera has a timer, AF caneler, exposure compensation, flash on/off and a film counter.I am very happy that I bought this camera because it is so affordable and is feature packed and delivers perfect pictures."
4,tight Album,somewhere between Curtis Mayfield&Maxwell you have Leroy Hutson.this cat truly has soul&His playing along with His Songwriting is right on time.another tight collection of songs from the Cat.
3,O.K. book,It's interesting what the reviewers say about the albums and artists.One review that completely stood out was Appetite For Destruction by Guns N' Roses.It explained about why it was so important and why so many people liked it while giving a lot of info about the band's history.Samson are a band that got some high ratings on a few of their albums but no review.This book still kind of pisses me off because I really hate people telling me what to like and what to hate.
1,Very disappointing.,"Lots of misinformation (incorrect titles, release dates, etc.) and shamefully incomplete discographies. Tell us about all of an artist's albums, not just one or two of them."
1,Misguided advice that disrespects children,"Jim Fay and his crew have created a lot of misguided garbage to give to struggling parents as ""microwave"" solutions that are just gimmicks. Their constant use of making the child feel guilty about ""draining the parents energy"" as absolutely stupid. These supposed parent educators clearly do not understand the motivations of a child. Parents: steer clear of any Love and Logic books! Their ""scotch tape solutions"" don't work!"
4,Love it.,"I really liked this book. I do agree that it has some ideas that may not work for every child, but generally speaking, it is very effective. I think that if you need ideas on how to parent without going crazy, glean from this book what you will and life will start getting easier."
5,Excellent for overwhelmed parents of young children!,"As a mother to 3 kids under the age of 4, I was living a life of chaos. Our kids were really tenderhearted and sweet, but our lack of any disapline or structure was turning our children into monsters! I didn't read the original book - I didn't ever have that much time! This book was very easy to read, and very thourough. I felt that the repitition of certain techniques was wonderful, I knew what to try without having to re-read the book trying to find the important points. This book has changed our outlook as parents, and we have been able to bring calm and peace to our very young home. I highly reccomend this book to overwhelmed parents of young children."
1,Beware! This book contains hyperbole!,"While noone has all th answers to parenting, some guides are a lot more useful than others. It seems there is a strong religious influence on this book with examples of ""God gave us...."" within the first few pages. Apparently naughty children grow up to shoot their classmates (page 42-43).For a more useful guide, please do yourself a favour and buy Christopher Green's Toddler Taming."
3,STOP! Sixth Sense Gary Cillins filler Crap,I love Night Gallery but the majority of episodes are Gary Collins Sixth Sense filler episodes. Argh! Wish I had read the review above as I would certainly NOT have bought the entire season!!
5,Worked really well!,"This video really worked. It is not that hard to do, and I saw results within a few weeks. I really do have firmer and flatter abs."
4,"Excellent video, full of variety and good movements.","The video has three segments, each ten minutes, each different. It makes it more fun to do many times since you can do a different segment every day. It is a little too easy if you are advanced, more appropriate for beginners and intermediates."
5,I have muscles again...,"Despite Tamilee's occasional misuse of words, (e.g.; ""put an apple or orange between your chin...[between my chin and what???]) this tape is the best. I don't normally like work out tapes, but this one is short enough to keep me interested and tough enough to keep me going. I have been using it for 5 years and I recommend it to anyone!!"
3,Mixed emotions,"This video is good for beginners, but those looking for a more intense ab workout I would suggest buying another video. In my opinion she doesn't do enough reps of each exercise and some of them you don't even feel as if you're doing anything at all!!! However, she's a great instructor so I am going to try to original Abs of Steel."
3,a fun gift for an 8 yr old,"We wanted to get our son something that had a bit of educational value in addition to all the Baku-gan stuff he was asking for. This chem set fit the bill nicely. There are some things that go off right away, like the volcano, and there are others that take some time and patience, like the crystals. I thought some of the instructions could have been a little more thorough and some of the parts feel a bit cheap, but this is an economical chem set that I think most kids (and their parents) would probably enjoy. Another nice thing is that, for the most part, the ingredients are easily replaceable."
4,Great book for musicians... not so great for scientists,"This is a great book for those who intend to develop their ears, truly our most important tool to make music. However, as an engineer, I have to agree that there are several gross errors about sound waves and other concepts badly defined. Don't confuse anything meant to be objective (and rigorously defined, such as frequency, time, etc.) with subjective matters, feelings, etc.The book is very useful, though, concerning how to learn the ability to improve one's musicianship through the best use of our ears. I reached the same conclusions by myself, while learning to transcribe and write music, and it DEFINITELY gave me a new whole meaning about music. In particular, the whole question about the myth of ""perfect pitch"" is properly addressed. Who cares about C or D# or Bb? Be a key-independent musician!Use the musical aspects of the book, they're great! Forget anything that has a (bad) scientific explanation."
3,Challenging Book,"The challenge for any instructional book is to find one on your own level - not reviewing what you already know & not too far over your head. I am an experienced musician, but I found this book to be difficult & dry. You definitely need a keyboard handy to practice the exercises given."
5,Provides solid training in an easy format,"It took me a while to get used to the style of presentation and the style of writing, but very soon I found myself learning the material with ease. Everything is broken down into small teaching/learning units so the reader doesn't feel overwhelmed even by an unfamiliar topic. I am an amateur musician and the book appears quite suitable for my needs and very comprehensive in its coverage. I would recommend this for anyone wanting to pursue ear training."
3,"good, but know this:","it is NOT A NOVEL. i'm not sure if there are buried reviews or blatant general descriptions that were grossly overlooked on my part, but i didn't know what to expect out of it...turns out it's written in pseudo-devotional-style passages, each relatively independent of the others..it has certainly got some encouraging points and passages, however i have let it sit for a while unfinished. compared to other works of coelho, i felt this offered more ""milk"" than ""meat"" (the latter in which i am more interested.) like i said, it is encouraging at points, but not very challenging overall. to be frank it seemed to be executed somewhat arrogantly, with less heart than other works of his. (though appreciated, nonetheless, for what it is - solid 3, not less)one man's opinion.."
3,Disappointed,"I am a big Paublo Choelo fan, but this book disappointed me. This one left me feeling flat and uninspired. Maybe it's simply that I expected more. For some, perhaps the pieces in this book may awaken ""something"". I prefer sticking with his storytelling....and receiving much more magic and depth! If you've read similar books (with small excerpts) by teachers like Eckart Tolle, etc., you will probably be disappointed in ""Warrior of The Light"", as I was. This book arrived from Amazon damaged in shipping, so luckily I was able to return it for a full refund. Thanx Amazon!"
4,Worth reading,Book was just as described. Maybe not as philosophical as i was expecting but definitly worth reading. There are some really good quotes in the book.
4,Excellent teachings for tantric advancement,"The contents of this book explained the indepth visualization of the Vajrakilaya tantra in ever detail. Although personal instruction is best, this book covers almost every needed aspects to practice in solitary. It reviews all the needed preliminary and ending practices which allows the internalization of the diety.For those that have any knowledge of tantric practice, this book will add immense focus to practicing the release of anger and confrontation of its source within. The book has a history of the creation and mythology surrounding vajrakilaya.For those seeking the esoteric tantra practices this book is a good stepping stone to add to what knowledge already possessed. It should, however, be combined with another title of indepth study of the whole scope of highest tantric practices, so that more of the specific visualizations and measured levels achieved in tantric practice are understood."
4,Dio - 'Last In Line' tour/album t-shirt,"Most of you old school metal fans likely recognize right off the bat, the design from the old 1984 MTV video for the title track from Dio's epic metal materpiece lp, 'Last In Line'. I've seen others out at concerts, CD stores,etc wear this t-shirt. For certain reason(s), I rarely purchase many t-shirts like this anymore. Looks good, doesn't it?"
4,The McClurkin Project,"I really love this CD. I love the first cut and the duet with Tramaine Hawkins was special. It may have been their first recording as a family, but it is certainly not their first time singing together. Their harmony, pitch and cadence was absolutely perfect. Loved It!!!!!!! However, the CD was damaged so Every Little Beat of My Heart skips throughout the cut."
4,Big and Lukewarm at the same time,"Notice 4 out of 5 stars. I like the book, it's chock full of facts and information. If you think you know a lot about cymbals, think again. On an informational level, I have never even heard of a book that goes this far. The only complaints I have are: It needs more color photography throughout, and itdesperately needs to be revised and updated. If you can overlook that glaring omission, I highly reccommend this book."
4,Everything you need to know about cymbals (almost),"Other than Zildjian's own book on the history of cymbals, Hugo's book is it. His book is fantastic! Everything from where they came from, to how they are made, to how they can be repaired. I'd give this book a 5 star rating, but I feel it needs to be revised. There has been amazing things happening in the cymbal world and Hugo's book stops when it was published. If anything, there should be a book for the last 20 years of cymbal making, maybe Hugo will write another?"
3,Good... but short,"This is a sweet sounding disk, and my 2yo daughter loves it. Everything is pretty much on the slow tip, which makes it a good pre-bedtime listen.Just two caveats: The bit in the middle (""Rock & Roll) with kids blowing on kazoos and singing gets irritating very fast. And this CD is only 24 minutes long, which is a fine length for a child, but pretty skimpy for a full-priced CD. The whole thing would fit on one side of an LP!"
3,Not my favorite,"I have all of Elizabeth Mitchell's CD's and this one is my least favorite. There are a couple of cute songs on there, but we hardly ever listen to it, b/c my son absolutely loves her other CD's better (Little Bird & You are my Sunshine). If you're deciding which one to get, I'd go with the two above that I mentioned!"
4,just right,"My kids and I like this album so much-- it's sweet and simple for kids, but also nice to listen to if you are an adult. The songs are (or remind me of) those I learned as a child, and the vocals and arrangments are great."
1,UK Version???,"I must agree with the other three reviews, when I first clicked on the product I never noticed it was a U.K. Version, my only question is WHY? What possible good does this do anyone here? Money flushed right down the crapper! Beware of all law and business ""for Dummies"" I love these but not the uk version."
4,Good introduction,It is a really great book. Even when is only a fragment of the whole book of Kojeve. If you want an introduction to Kojeve thougth it is a good way of doing it. In addition it is a good translation into English.
5,Introduction to the Reading of Kojeve,"Many people criticize Kojeve for misinterpreting Hegel. This misses the point. Kojeve's reading of Hegel is anthropocentric which, as Kojeve well knows, was not Hegel's intent. This book shouldn't be read as a commentary on Hegel (for that look to Hypolite) but rather as an original work of philosophy in it's own right. It should be read as a work of philosophy and attributed all the respect that great works of philosophy deserve. But then if you're reading this you probably already know this."
3,Review of Mr Foley's book.,"The book is well written and flows well. Since the book was written 50 years after the war was over, I suspect that it contains some actual history and a lot of imagination. One of the often repeated experiences is the shelling by the German 88mm gun. The author says that he hit the dirt when he heard the shells coming. This is not possible because the 88 shell moves faster than the speed of sound. He also said several times that he was fired upon by snipers while he was walking in the open. On each occasion, he said that the snipers were 75 yards from him and missed. 75 yards with a Mauser is point blank range and I can't believe that the snipers could miss at that range. One last thought, if the experiences of the author are true, he would have to be a combination of Audie Murphy and John Wayne."
4,Get a clock from IKEA,"It's a clock.It's very readable from a distance.However, the back plastic piece that it hung from snapped, so I wedged it into a ceiling vent and it stayed snugly.If you have low expectations, you won't be disappointed."
4,Wonderful Music,"This is good, wholesome music for our times. The entire family can enjoy it, together."
4,Free stuff,"The sequel is out, and it's a free PDF at lulu. It's called Elsie and Friends: The Scrapbook Collection."
2,Marlna Multi-Vac,"I am not impressed with this item it is very cheaply made, batteries did not work all that good on the product. I would not recommend for anyone to buy at all."
2,Poor value,"While much of the covered material is well presented, the price cannot be justified. Design Basics Index is a far better value that presents similar information with more mini ""case study"" examples. I'm also disappointed that the discussion of new technologies is still weak like the previous version.I wish that this book could be affordable the way that Princeton Architectural Press' books (such as Ellen Lupton's excellent book ""Thinking with Type"" are.The people this book is most aimed at - beginning students - are those who can least afford it."
1,piece of junk,"This thing is the biggest piece of junk I ever bought. It had so many air leaks, the hoses keep coming apart, it couldn't suck smoke much less liquid through a tube. It was a total loss of money."
4,Who knew you could change oil without getting under the car,"I've used this just once, but it worked just as advertised. Very handy that you can see exactly how much oil you've removed (unlike earlier versions of this product) so you know exactly how much new oil to add back.Transferring oil from the liquivac to take to recycling also super easy and clean.In my car (2010 Mini) the oil filter also changes from the top of the car, so doing an oil change without getting under the car is a breath of fresh air."
1,Dont Buy it,"I bought this, and its junk. When I was pumping, the pump itself kept falling off, hence no vaccum. Instead, google qwik oildrainvalveI got that."
1,I give this a -10 out of +10,"Some of these songs are hella cool but when they get spoiled rich kids to sing these tight songs they kill it. those moms who are overly protective make me spit make your kids listen to Slipknot,KoRn,Sum 41,and Black Sabbeth. Then when they go to school singing along to Gorillaz as a pop version of it theyll get no friends because the other kids actually have the cool version of it i feel sorry for those kids who has there parents force them to listen to it without the better parts cut out. I found a kids bop cover near my school and went to my house and burned it and then i head kids screaming."
1,We Belong Together And Boyfried!!,Some of the lyrics are so adult??? Shouldn't anybody tell them why shouldn't sing those song?? All the songs are nice but still annoyin' with those scratchy voice and Gorillaz jajajaja that was the comedy point. Need some laughs! Hear these records! Well it won't be funny coz at some points you'll feel ashamed for them. Poor kids
1,How on earth this tripe debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 is beyond me...,"Kidz Bop 9 debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 in its first week. How!? I thought everyone was sick of it by now! Some of these lyrics really aren't for kids; as other reviewers have pointed out, young kids like these shouldn't be singing about stealing boyfriends (!). They certainly know how to ruin some good songs, strictly speaking ""We Belong Together"" and ""Feel Good Inc."" The worst of the lot is Kelly Clarkson's ""Behind These Hazel Eyes,"" a great song totally ruined by whiney kids' voices."
1,HIGHLY Innapropriate for children.,"Several of the tracks included on this collection are innapropriate for children. There are references to drug use, skipping and breaking into school, and some stronger language. While a few of the tracks are probably fine, these songs were written geared towards an adult audience. Having innocent children perform them does not make them child appropriate. My child received this as a gift. Thank goodness I have the foresight to censor what she listens to."
1,Not Recommended,"While it is hard to denegrade the work of another, in my opinion this work is not at the level of The Alchemist. I didn't find it enlightening or entertaining. To attribute the story to the prophet Elijah appears to be biblical profiteering. There is a curse in the biblical writings concerning the addition or subtraction of text. This book may step over the line. I cannot recommend you spend your money on this book. Even more important, I cannot recommend you spend your time."
3,Not bad,"I haven't read any books that really impress me lately and I hoped this one would. But when I finished it, I thought it was just another decent book with some nice parts and some parts that seemed aimless.I understand it is a fable and all that. I knew what to expect. It was easy to read (which is good) and the points it made are pretty obvious (which isn't as good). Hey, I don't have a problem with it. I just think it isn't any big deal.Three stars!"
3,"Worthy effort, but falls short in the spiritual realm","This novel does an admirable job of rendering heroes of Biblical proportion (literally) as down-to-earth people with real fears, dreams, and desires. Coelho's portrayal of Elijah rings true from a physical (and perhaps emotional) perspective, but it loses a little in the spiritual realm. Eventually the book becomes a place for the author to spout cliched gobbledygook about God. Nothing new in that department. All in all however, not a bad read."
5,Where can I get this????,"Where can I get this cd, or even just the songs off of it? I absolutely love this album, and have Sun Down and Citadel of Stars, but I need Cynical Me and Where Would I Go."
1,More like Gay to Boring of Sex,"I was very disappointed with this movie! The box described it to be as humorous, and horny! This movie resembled a cheap, low-budget, porno movie with absolutely no plot line! The actors would be eat some pastries and drinking tea, when it automatically cuts to the sex scene in their 89' Honda Hatch back. I should've gone to Blockboster instead, to rent ""HONK IF YOU'RE HORNY."""
3,Fine book on the perspectives of gay men and death,"In this era of AIDS, a book memorializing the perspective of gays regarding death has long been needed, in this epidemic. This book does so, and is well worth reading now, and later.Recommended."
3,review for two homes,"This book was helpful, however, for very young children. Perhaps 3 to 4 year olds. I found it a little young for my 7 year old children. Good illistrations, very, very basic."
1,Don't buy this ! Waste of money...,Doesn't do what it promises. I couldn't sense any massaging effect at all. All I heard was some vibration which is not what massaging is. Don't waste your money in buying this product.
2,Read this book if you want to compete,"Rather than offering advice to older real-people who would like to stay in shape, Higdon offers advice for those athletes who wish to remain competitive beyond their 40's. He does so by filling the book with anectodes on his own running career instead of translating that knowledge and experience into something most of can really use. This book reads more like Higdon's memoir, not the how-to book I was anticipating."
1,No Bill No Coo,As a child I saw Bill and Coo in the theater. It was one of my favorite movies. I was looking forward to sharing the film with my grandchildren but the DVD quality was so bad it wasn't worth seeing; it was too dark the sound was garbled and I felt it was a total rip off.
2,TOO BIG for these ages of laptops and netbooks,"Works properly etc. etc.I'm unhappy because it's just too big for my hands used to regular keyboards, laptops or even a netbook, so say when I reach out to the Backspace I never get it, or same with many keys.Another thing is the poor design in that many keys have VERY diferent SIZE. I've measured them, the N is literally TWICE as big as the M sitting right next to it. I promise, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TYPE WITHOUT MISTAKES for serveral weeks at least which is what I've used it, probably never if as me you still use 2 or 3 other normal keyboards during the day. I'm typing in it at half my usual speed and looking at the keys."
3,Interference with 2nd Microsoft Wireless device,I've got two computers that are about 8 feet apart and I as soon as we start to use the second we get a low signal indication although the device does work properly. Reconnecting the wireless channel does not help.
1,Very poor wireless capability.. Stay away from this,"I bought this product from Samsclub and its going back tomorrow. I have been using logitech wireless mouse and wanted a keyboard and mouse combination, so went for this. The wireless signal is really lousy and u need to have a straight line of sight for this to work. Also, if u r more than 3 ft from the wireless receiver, it will not work. I would have given it negative stars if possible."
3,Good music not persian,The music is beautiful. No argument there. But I failed to hear any Persian music in there. -In the Persian Garden- and -Dervish Delight- sound absolutely Japanese.
4,It's cute and fun,"I got this for myself, and it's a lot of fun. Doesn't sound as pretty as some other toy pianos, but it's...well, quirky. I like that about it; it has a certain charm.A couple of keys stick slightly and that tends to slow down playing a bit. Other than that, it's fun for just goofing around. I'm sure it's great for kids who want the basics. :]"
2,Completely off key,"This little piano is a blast for kids to play, and is a magnet for any toddlers that visit for playdates. Unfortunately, there is nothing musically correct about the piano, except that the notes to the right do become progressively higher. If you are hoping for a little instrument to help develop your budding musician's ear, show them what an octave is, allow them to create a feedback loop in their brains about the relationship between notes as they play, or care about how it sounds, look elsewhere. If anybody knows of a little piano that is tuned or can be tuned correctly, I'd like to know about it. This is a fun, cacaphonous noisemaker with piano keys, which isn't how it was advertised, and as such it was overpriced."
2,fun but made like poorly,"I got this as a gift. my 3 month old loved playing with this gym, but at first, she would scream every time the music came on. it is so unbelievably loud! after re-introducing this toy about 10 times, she stopped crying at the high volume. she was amazed each time she hit the toy the correct way to make the music come on. it definitely helped teach her some 'cause and effect'. the bad thing was that it literally fell apart in 2 weeks time. one of the adjustments let you angle the main part of the toy - it never screwed in correctly. now, the sensor doesnt work, so it continuously plays whether she's touching it or not and the screws keep falling out of the main part- choking hazard!!! not made well at all. i'm very disappointed! also- the green kick plate was great for kicking- but at a mere 3 months, she was kicking the toy away from herself. i took it off so she couldn't move the toy away and raised her feet with the boppy instead. very sad."
2,An ok toy,"We bought this for our son when he was 2 months old and he has yet to be interested in it. The music is very loud and he has no interest in playing with any of the buttons or objects on it. He does kick it and push it away from him, so I constantly have to push it back towards him. At 4 1/2 months old, he still is not that interested in it, but we keep trying it out each day to see if it will spark an interest."
2,Watch the little fingers,My little one got her fingers stick it the toy. I had to tape it off. Still not a very fun toy at all.
1,Broke the second day,Got this present for a Santa gift for two year old. The loader broke off the second day. It is made of plastic and broke very easily.
3,Lover Boys,Eight adorable Bratislavan boys take a well earned break at a sensational mountain ski resort. They soon discover that the cold and snow make it impossible for them to keep their firm young bodies off each other
3,"If you already know carving, then this book is for you","A well illustrated book, at times however the detail lacks a bit and you do need to refer colsely to the pictures to see what the next steps are. That is the down side, but on the other hand there are some great designs to try out both for the experienced carver and the not so experienced. If you do get this book, then make sure that you have a lot of fruit and veg in stock (esp. cucumber!)"
4,Lovely message.,"When the story starts, we're told about a man who lives in a great plain full of things nobody wanted. Every night he reads about the rain forest, until one day an idea ""sprouted and grew"" in his mind and he starts to build his own forest out of the scraps around his house. He fills the forest with tin trees and animals, and flowers of metal and glass, until one day a real bird stops on a branch. The man is overjoyed, but saddened when the bird leaves him again. However (yay!) the bird comes back, this time with seeds, and by the end of the book we can see that the tin forest has become intermingled with the real one, and you cannot easily distinguish the one from the other.The language is beautiful and simple. The pictures are well-done. The message is not overstated. I love this book."
2,Had to trim down my 2X4s for use.,"I had to take a chisel to each end of the treated standard 2X4s I used with these. Royal pain in the tuccus. They are also very thin/lightweight and I don't expect them to last more than a couple of seasons before cracking and falling apart. Cheap junk, IMO."
2,Won't last,"I was very happy when I first purchased these. Set up was quick and easy and you can ""customize"" the size of your wood pile. I was skeptical of the plastic holding up, and after a year both brackets have cracked and broken. The plastic is too thin to withstand the temperature changes through the seasons along with the weight of the wood.If you only need them for one winter then these are for you, if you want anything longer than that you, you will be disappointed."
1,Plastic? They don't last a season!,Steel alternatives available for the same price. These are not worth it. one two three four five six seven eight
3,"So far, so good","To get it out of the way... These were ordered on Amazon through Northern Tool. It took about 25 days for them to ship. Keep that in mind.Overall, they were easy to setup. 4 2x4's later (for each pair), and our wood pile is cleaned up and stacked neatly. Used 2 of these back to back to make a nice large holder that is taking up less space and is easily covered by a tarp.Seem sturdy, will see how they hold up over the winter with UV. Plastic is plastic, and it does degrade."
4,Thus far my favorite...,I love this angsty over top rock album! Probably my favorite My Chemical Romance CD thus far.
1,bone chilling to use a pun,"I ordered this to hear what the band played and was appalled at the lyrics to the one song ""DEAD""! There is a warning for explicit lyrics, but I would never have imagined that ANYONE would find this music(?) appealing.I am a concerned Grammy! Has anyone heard Bob Dylans latest cd? It's the best- thanks Bob for some real class. Stay well everyone. Much love. Grammy Vance"
1,if you liked the first two albums don't buy this one,"its terrible, its derivative, predictable and a huge disappointment...if you liked the frenetic paced earlier albums you will hate the Black Parade. Sure they throw in some interesting nods to 70s rock with this 'concept' album but it comes off as ill-conceived. Its basically punk by numbers, prime for MTV airplay and the genero-rock fans."
2,Sort of a Disappointment,"Perhaps they are trying to do something different. I'm not a MCR hater, and when i heard welcome to the black parade on the radio, i really liked the intro, but then they ruined the total atmosphere they had originally captured with the annoying guitar riffs right after. Each time i was about to convert to being a fan while listening to the album, they keep ruining it with those annoying guitar chords. It's almost as if halfway through writing the song they lost the energy they started off with...the energy that does come off this album seems fake and manufactured. I know My Chemical Romance can do better."
2,black parade cd,Its a great CD I love mcr. When I received the CD the case was broken. I probably won't buy another CD from these buyers.
4,It's about time some talent returned to rock,"I know MCR are technically an ""emo"" band, but this CD is a refreshing return to the bombast of 70's rock. Great production, excellent musicianship(especially the guitar work). Loved it. One of the best of the year. Of course, the best CD of the year is RHCP's ""Stadium Arcadium"", but that's another story. Buy ""The Black Parade"", put in your earbuds, and remember a time when bands treated the album as an art form, and weren't afraid to be theatrical and showy."
3,Good Condition,"Plays fine, However I think that the CD was a burned copy from the Original.but its fine and the is still in very good condition."
1,This is horrible!,"If I could give this Cheese guy a 0 rating, I'd give him -500. This guy is absolutely horrible. He takes perfectly good or decent songs and butchers them badly. At least Weird Al does funny parodies. This guy is just purely BAD. I can't believe that record companies put money to back and release this horrible album. I'd buy William Hung's album before I buy this nonsense."
1,Disappointment,"This book was not at all what I expected. Mr. Nimoy wastes precious pages copying the back and forth circulation of memos between himself and various studio personnel. Somewhat amusing, the stories would have been better told through Mr. Nimoy's narrative with portions of the memo's used for emphasis. I expected more of an autobiography, but Mr. Nimoy makes only murky references to his personal life, some of which seem to be purposely misleading. If you have exhausted all other avenues of Star Trek set trivia, you might read this book as a last resort. If you're looking for a picture of Leonard Nimoy, the man, forget it."
2,When Species Met Porky's...,"Once upon a time in a sick-o place two genres met and formed this very weak horror/scifi/comedy hybrid. Even the special effects looked tired. Aliens posing as hot babes are on the prowl for young cute guys to turn them into bugs. What is the facination with turning people into bugs? Actually I would have enjoyed this movie if it held my interest. Too much ""Porky's"" and not enough ""Species."" Long boring dialog that leads nowhere and poor direction, weak screenplay, and lets face it, a silly idea for a movie anyway. [...]"
2,"No big deal, but not a total turkey either...","This is a very weak horror movie, shot with completely unknown young actors, but at least it has good photography and steady direction. You can see wahat's about to happen miles ahead, but, hey! If you watch this one to jsut have a little fun, it's a good movie. Of course, you'll NEVER be compelled to watch it ever again, but nothing is perfect.."
3,Memory-Friendly and Compact,"I was imprest by how compactly this grammar is set up for the student and how helpful that compactness is for the mind to cover a lot of grammar and remember it more easily. The book has a great approach to helping one do exactly as it says, ""conquer the complexities of Arabic grammar"".The only disappointment was that it leaves out two fairly important parts of the language: numerals and the imperative mood of the verb. I think these are certainly essential enough that they should be in a beginner's book. Without those, as a concise beginner's book for the grammar of the Arabic language, it has a disappointing incompleteness.I recommend this book if you already studied the grammar of the language and may be having difficulty with some of the complexities of the language. This book will help you understand the language in a much more compact and memory-friendly way."
3,jesus christ superstar (used) disc # 2,"thought i was buying the original 2 cd set, only to find out it was only disc 2 at a hefty price. it was very hard to see the way it was displayed that it was only disc #2 they were selling. very disappointed. paid way too much for a used cd."
5,Fantastic album,"Yes, this is a blast from the past, but nothing can surpass the original recording of JCS. So much memorable music. It is a bit dated now, but still a very worthwhile score."
1,Horrible CD,"I was extremely disappointed with my purchase of Jesus Christ Superstar. It is a 2-disc set, but I only received 1 disc. The disc was of very poor quality. Ultimately, the disc would not play any music at all. I won't buy music from Amazon again."
2,Stopped working after two years,"I was using this fixture with a 150 watt ceramic heater over my python's cage. Worked great in that it was able to sit on the wire screen cover directly. The two negatives I can report are:1) The strain relief were the cord goes into the socket is inadequate. Just the weight of the cord hanging over the edge of the tank is enough to pull it loos from the socket.2) After a little over two years the on/off switch no longer closes and turns off the fixture. You can wiggle the switch and it will turn back on, but after a few minutes it goes out again.So overall, for the price id expect it to last much more than two years."
3,A big dud,First charge lasted 4 days but it has been downhill ever since. Even while sitting idle it loses a charge quickly.
4,Question ?,"I like this product at the point that the sound is clear , picture is pretty good ,but I only can communicate with one address only. Hopefully in future we will have a better product that can chat with two or three different address at the same time without drop call.THANK YOU"
2,Mediocre image quality,"I bought this camera for the mechanical pan/tilt feature, and I was quite happy with how that works. However, I was very disappointed with the image quality. It is significantly worse than my Logitech pro 3000 that I bought years ago. I'm guessing that if I would have paid the extra bucks to get the newer orbit AF (2 megapixel vs 1.3 megapixel of the MP) the image quality would have been what I've come to expect from Logitech. But I went with the cheaper option and am left with a very disappointing product."
3,Content,It's pretty decent product but I am not impressed. Mine worked fine for sometime but the leverage USB stick died after a year so I am using it without the stick. Bummer :-(
4,Works like a charm.,I am not a tech geek and found this product easy to set up. The picture is very clear and works well with yahoo messenger. I enjoy camming with my son at college!
2,"Cheerleader, part 2","Fans of The Cheerleader will rejoice at seeing a sequel to this novel. Familiar characters return, such as Puddles and Bev. However, it's much too long and rather depressing."
5,The only Lucia!!!!!!!,"I got this Lucia yesterday! Finally!!!!!! After this magnificent Lucia I cannot listen to any other Lucia anymore, not even Sutherland! I'm a new Callas-Fan! So glad I bought this! Finally I understood why all opera-experts adore this woman!"
1,Disappointing!,"I know, I know--it is Maria. However, the production has been hacked up so much that is is like half of the opera. As well, the background noises are very off-putting. During the famous ""mad scene"" one can hear what sounds like a man singing as well. I was quite disappointed in this CD and would not recommend it to anyone but the most rabid Callas fan."
1,"Boy, this guy sure THINKS he's funny!","This was quite possibly the worst book I've ALMOST read in a long time. As a fan of MST3K, I really had high hopes for Nelson's book, and why not? The head writer and later host of a really funny show writes a book of reviews of cheesy movies - sounds really promising, doesn't it? Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver.Nelson's book is written in a highly personal style - annoyingly so. We get to hear about his wife, his kids, his house, ad nauseum. The talent for repartee evidenced on his show is absent from his prose, and the jokes consist of abstract remarks that are neither humorous nor creative. The overall tone is that of a man who finds HIMSELF incredibly funny, and who cares what you think?I managed to wade through about the first 30 pages of this stinker before I threw it down in disgust. If you're really dying to try it, please search for it on Half.com, where my copy is currently for sale."
5,A Very Good Book,"Being a fan of bad movies, I really enjoyed this book. Mike Nelson, the man best known for being the host on MST3K for the later half of the shows life. All I can say is he knows a lot about bad movies! If you enjoyed his work on MST3K you will probably enjoy this book. It is both funny and witty. Worth the money in my opinion."
4,good for the price,"Pretty decent 3-hole punch for the price. Seems very solid. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it takes a hard press to work it. Hopefully over time it'll loosen up and press easier. But it works well, I am satisfied."
4,Kids don't usually turn into bugs!,"The Transmogrification of Roscoe Wizzle, by David Elliott is a great book. If you like exciting cliffhanger books, you will like this one. This book is written by the main character. The book is very exciting. The author writes that if you eat at a Burger restaurant for 6 months something bad will happen to you. In the sixth month, one day something does happen to Roscoe Wizzle. He turns into a bug during class because someone says the word ""transmogrification"". After a while, Roscoe and his friend go to Gussy's. Roscoe gets in a fight. I'm not going to tell you the rest of the story, so read the story. So if you like cliff-hanger stories call your mom up and ask her to start running!"
4,Excellent Childrens book,Gave as a gift to my niece and she read it all in one sitting...loved it and can't wait to read it again
1,Don't waste your time or money,Don't waste your time or money. Dollar store quality. Has a gray haze over it and does not fit correctly.
4,On Polito Ibañez,"Polito Ibañez is one of those rare jewels of contemporary music that you must know about, to be able to find. I attended a couple of his concerts in Cuba and he was absolutely electrifying. It is the kind of show you don't see very oftenly, with the right balance of music, voice and INTELLIGENT lyrics. He's the kind of guy who makes you jump to the music, and at the same time makes you think ""Wow, that's deep."" ""Para no Pensar"" (Not to think) marks the definite maturity of his career. Hopefully there is more to come.Too bad I can't get his CD's on Amazon.com"
1,Poor is too optimistic!,The product does not live up to its description.It is very inaccurate. It creates more work than it saves.It is slow to work with in every aspect.I am very dissatisfied.
2,Disappointment,"The TextBridge Pro 11 does not work nearly as well as hyped. It doesn't retain page layout. Only marginally better than the TextBridge Pro 9 that I was previously using. In fact, there was one feature the older version had that the newer one doesn't, so that makes using the newer version a little more cumbersome. I should have saved my money. The seller, however was fabulous in helping me with my order."
4,These are great speakers,"I have had these KLH satellite speakers for several years now and they have been great. They pick up on all of the surround sound action I could hope for. I have a very basic system with KLH center, front, and rear speakers, a Jensen subwoofer, and a Sherwood receiver. What I found really made the sound the best was the digital audio cable from the DVD player to the receiver. My system is now behind the times, but it still works great and I look forward to using these speakers with my future systems."
3,well made but a bit scary for little ones,"our girls loved the twelve princes so much we decided to try this set. unfortunately, most were too scary for our little girls (2 & 4). some of the scary things for kids are just a bit much for little ones while some are more evil in nature (wizard, witch, etc.). might consider caution if you'd prefer to avoid these things)."
4,Please pass the baquette and cheese,"A beautiful trip through the vineyards in California. The only thing I missed was the names of the vineyards and wineries as we passed by. The signs were ""avoided"" which I found distracting. I would have liked to end this video with a shot of sitting at a table outdoors at a winery - enjoying a glass of wine and a snack!"
2,Sunday stroll by car,"This is a nice sedate drive through the wine country without a single bicycle to be seen. It could be a great video for Charles Kurwalt's sunday morning show, complete with the classical music. It is not a training video."
1,WARNING**NOT A WORKOUT**,"I've been using spinning DVDs for years. I love Mindy Mylrea's Spinning DVDs. This is actually the first workout DVD I've ever bought including those for pilates, yoga, stretching, that I've regretted. IT IS NOT A WORKOUT. The reviewer who labeled it as ""crap"" was right. Don't bother. SOOOOO not worht it.Who works out to classical music??? Please. Plus even the sound/video quality seemed cheap."
5,Totolly Awesome and Inspring,"Great book, it also taught TrueSpace in a matter of weeks instread of learning by exprimentation."
3,Technicolor does not a great film make,"If you're a military aviation buff, you'll love ""Captains of the Clouds"", but you will have to wade through the stock characters, unbelievable ""romantic"" subplot, and cheap special effects (maybe these were the best they could do at the time). The rewards are gorgeous scenery shot in the wilds of Ontario in summer of 1941 and colorful British and American aircraft. At the time, Canada was fighting in World War II alongside Great Britain, the ""mother empire"", while Americans were wondering what would happen next. By the time ""Captains"" was released in 1942, America had entered the war, and this became the last of a series of Warner Brothers ""preparedness"" pictures - military-themed movies inviting Americans to prepare for war. God bless."
3,Surrealistic Poetry,"However abrasive his presentation Pearl Jam's 'Lion' does have a point, all the tunes on this album are pretty homogenous. Despite Kirkwood's status as a guitar hero, largely deserved in my not so humble opinion, I think it should be acknowledged that his truest talent is in writing poety of the surrealistic variety. On that level he succeeds admirably with this alubm and as such it is worth a shekel or so. In addition, the album cover features llamas which those in the know understand are the coolest species to inhabit the earth."
5,An excellent guide,"This book is the one I always refer back to. From the fine points of raising pups of these strong willed, intelligent dogs to principles of herding, the reader will be glad he/she bought this book. Unfortunately there is a common bias against Australian Cattle Dogs. Lithgow doesn't promote this bias and instead helps the novice or advanced handler understand his/her dog so they can better work as a team. The Appendix- A Rationale for Rearing Procedures is especially helpful in regard to understanding serotonin and epinephrine reactions in dogs. Some of the best herding instructors have their breed preferences, but they should revere Lithgow's way as a Teacher, and do away the petty politics of breed clubs. Until this rampant immaturity ceases, it would be best for a novice handler to seek an instructor who has the same breed."
2,Horrible,"A true look into the world of softcore porn. The sound quality was horrible and, if you are like me, you like it real, and not hidden by legs, blankets, or other misc. material."
5,When's the sequel coming out?,"I bought a used cassette tape of this album in desperation for a 3 year old boy going on a road trip. It took me a while to get used to the sound quality, which seems ever so slightly fuzzy to me, but other than that I have no complaints with this album. It's not whiney kids music, but it appeals to kids, especially fans of the Bob the Builder song.My son started listening to this at age 3, and now, three years later, long after he's outgrown the Wiggles, it's still his favorite tape to listen to in the car.I am always thankful for the makers of this CD, as well as to my son's other favorite James Coffee (of I Love Toy Trains fame).The British accents don't bother my son at all, though personally I wish they'd chosen a woman with a slightly less chirpy voice for Wendy."
4,Bob Rocks!,This is the best album to come out of Britain in some time. Much better than Amnesiac or anything by Travis or Coldplay or Starsailor or any of the new next Radiohead/Oasis bands. This album is actually fun!
2,Crude hatchet job on the State of Israel.,"Livia Rokach so loathes Israel that she takes a good diary and twists it into a bad psuedo-history.For instance, she cites to Prime Minister Sharret's diary entries regarding the Lavon Affair and concocts, wholecloth, a conspiracy theory involving Ben Gurion, Dayan and Peres.No historian BUT Livia Rokach concurs.The author goes one step further and blood libels Israel with the most horrendous of accusations, namely, that rogue Israeli Activists, intent on creating a wider war with Jordan, murdered eleven of their fellow Jews at Maaleh Akrabim in 1955 and pinned the blame on Jordan. How low can you go.Again, no historian anywhere, (See Benny Morris, Israel's Border Wars) finds a shread of real evidence to support the author's wild-eyed slanderous lies.Sacred Terror is pulp fiction in the guise of history. I'll pass."
4,better then I expected,"Even if my favourite song is Nothing Fails this song is also good. The remixes are good but too short. Madonna can sing so why all effects on her voice, I hate that. This album is not better then her other works but very good. If you really this kind of music then buy it."
4,A Great New Single From Madonna,"This is the fourth single from American Life and certainly worth getting. This was my second favorite song from American Life (American Life being my favorite).The mixes are really good, though they aren't as different from one another as the mixes for American Life or Hollywood which is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Most of the mixes lay down a dance beat, then play Love Profusion over top. They do very little tampering with the vocals or even the order of the song such as putting the chorus first or just picking a few lines to repeat over and over.The Nothing Fails remix is better, I think, than the remixes on the Nothing Fails Maxi-Single.The album artwork is beautiful. It's very reminiscent of the Love Profusion video, which was great."
4,A Madonna's Profusion,"This is the third single from American Life album. Here you will find 6 great versions of the song and gets one bonus track of ""Nothing Fails"" that you can't find in other single. It's really a good choice."
4,"This book shows Nicolas Cage, the Actor","It gives you an inside look at how Nic prepares for a role and much background on each of his movies. I was a little disappointed that it did not share really anything about his personal life, except it did share the relationship between the Coppolla's. If you haven't seen all of his movies, you will want to watch each one after reading this book."
2,Kitty Mat,"I was disappointed with the mat. I thought the picture was misleading. The heating element is only about 6"" long and the faux suede mat itself is 24"". I had to order K&H's replacement heating pad that measures 19"" to cover more of the area. My cat loves it but I thought for the price I would have gotten a heating element that covered more of the surface that my cat would be on."
3,Good,"As it is with most movie sets, the first is always the best. 2nd wasn't bad, the last 2 was an ok. Mainly because it misses most of the same cast."
5,Good,"Good movie, blast from my childhood. I remember being scared out of my mind watching these, although I haven't seen the last one yet."
4,Tremors Attack Pack,"I've always had prompt service from Movie Mars, however, this is the first time I've received DVDs that had no identifying markings on the DVDs themselves. If I don't mark them it there will be no way to know, visually, what was on the DVDs. Looking at them the way they are, these very easily look like could have been made in someone's home."
4,Few Are Better,"The third installment of this series was the only thing that kept me from giving a full 5-star rating. Of course the original is the best (c'mon it had Bacon, Ward, and Reba), but #2 and #4 weren't shabby themselves.My favorite thing about these movies though is something that isn't even in the actually movie themselves. See a few years ago my fiancee was in the hospital with the ear infection from hell. She was in the hospital for about 60 hours and asleep for most of it. I hardly left her side. One while she was asleep I was flipping through the channels and landed on USA which was having a Tremors Marathon, showing all 4 movies. It was great! I couldn't leave her side, but sitting next to a sleeping person all day isn't a whole lotta fun, but Tremors was there for me. Now I think about her everything I watch one of the movies.A must have for an Sci-Fi Fan or fan of the original."
4,Good Price,"1,2 and 4 are good, havnt watched 3 yet. The case and box design are TERRIBLE. tremors 1 skipped playback for about 10 minutes in the middle, i assume poor quality disc becuase the rest was read fine."
5,bang for your buck!,"i've played with alot of different ball haulers in the past, but this harness has everything i could ever want! it's very flexible allowing you to travel light or carry a case of paint! it's very comfortable, i hardly notice it any more, the pods they sent with it are excellent quality, very durable, the whole thing looks real nice, there's even a little hidden pocket for your credit card, bills, or car key... we all know what a hassle it can be to stash things at the local field, so now just keep em on ya without worrying about losing anything!! and the price is more than fair for such a great rig!!!"
5,PM in Princeton,"1995 release featuring a live performance at Westminster Choir College,Princeton,New Jersey.PM on a Steinway D for 73:16 minutes.tracks:, Aural Contact I Sacrifices.2, Soul Eternal.3,Aural ContactII Initiation.4,Lost Way.5,Cachaca.6,Isle of View.7,Oral Contact:Shout.8,Talisman.9,Caprice of the Gods.10 Blue Monk.and Intro The Best Years of Our Lives.Like Windows Of Time this is another wonderful performance of Patrick Moraz on piano."
3,"For Guess Who Fans, a must!","If you were a fan of the power pop group ""The Guess Who"" then this CD is for you! Burton Cummings is in great voice and the lyrics are Guess Who-ish as are the hooks."
4,Love this guitar,"It was so hard to find a childs guitar that had real metal strings that didn't cost a fortune since I was looking for a TOY not a full blown real one. This one is perfect and is just amazing. Only thing is mine only came with one place at the butt of the guitar to attach the strap to, I have no ideal where the other side is suppose to attach too Im assuming mine is flawed and didn't get the 2nd attach knob thing put on it during production. My husband is going to rig it up later on his own since its just too much of a pain to mail back and my daughter is already in love with it. I got this for my 3 year old daughter and it is a little big for her but she manages just fine to play it (usually sits down with it on her lap) but she will be able to play this for a long time and grow into it. My husband also downloaded an app to tune it and was able to tune it perfectly to hit the notes right according to the app so that was surprising."
1,: GLUE DID NOT HOLD; PANEL PEELED OFF!!,"I HAPPILY BOUGHT THIS GUITER FOR MY SON. HE WAS REALLY EXCITED! WHEN HE OPENED THE BOX AND REMOVED THE GUITER, OUR JAWS DROPPED WHEN WE NOTICED HALF OF THE TOP PANEL OF THE RESONATOR HAD PEELED OFF. INCREDIBLE!! WE COULD SEE WHERE THE GLUE HAD DRIED OFF AND NOT HELD ONTO THE TOP PANEL. I WAS SO EMBARRASED AND SHOCKED.I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO MY SON WHY I HAD TO RETURN HIS MUCH ANTICIPATED. GIFT!DONT BUY THIS POORLY MADE PRODUCT!!they should have a zero star for such companies."
1,Poor quality,"Save your money. While the paint color is nice, that's about as good as it gets. The wood is unpainted in some places, it is basically untunable, and is more junk than anything else. Overpriced for what you get. I'm disappointed as Schoenhut makes some very nice kid's pianos. Too bad they don't do as well with this guitar. The $25 guitars from Toys R Us and Walmart are better than this one."
3,Schoenhut Guitar,"I purchased this for my niece and she was thrilled. Her and her brother are creating wonderful music. However, we tried to tune it before we gave it to her. The strings would not stay tight. One broke and had to be replaced before we could even give it to her! I realize it is not an expensive guitar, but I had hoped it would last till I could wrap it."
2,Scary Pink Paint,"We ordered this as a holiday gift for our daughter. I'm glad we ordered it early, because my husband looked at it for 10 seconds and told me to ship it right back. He is the musician in the family, but even I could see that it was not very good quality. It looked to be very cheaply constructed (messy glue joins) and the paint on the neck was rubbing right off. I worry enough about toxicity of toys without having to worry that my daughter is going to be subjected to toxic paint. We're looking for a better option. We bought a little Schoenhut piano for her when she was smaller and I was much more impressed with that. This guitar was no where near as nicely made."
1,Piece of junk!,"I ordered this guitar for my son's second birthday, this was supposed to be his ""big"" gift. When he opened the box he was SO excited! We promptly opened it and removed the guitar from the box. The guitar promptly fell apart into 3 pieces! The front of the guitar and the plastic on the neck of the guitar were unglued. My poor son started to cry immediately because he wanted to play. I definitely would NOT recommend this product to anyone!"
2,This is a TOY guitar.,"This is a TOY guitar. Not bad for sound, but the strings are high off the fretboard as I suspected they might be. I took a chance and bought this for my 7 year old grandson for Christmas, but I can't seriously give it to him if he's going to play it, and not just play with it. I've been teaching guitar for 30+ yrs. and I can't recommend this guitar for a student. I may give the guitar to a younger grandchild to play with it. The guitar will function for playing on the lower frets after I make some minor changes. Forget playing on the higher frets. I thought since this guitar was offered by a piano company, it may have better specs than the other cheap foreign made guitars I've seen, but I was wrong. Good thing it didn't cost an arm and a leg. Get what you pay for! So I classify it as a TOY with ability to get some music out of it."
4,Musical interest maintenance,"I gave my grandson a small ukulele when he was two years old, satisfying his interest for a ""music guitar."" I tuned it to a D major chord so that when he strummed he produced a tolerable sound. (Even if he is gifted, he was not likely to learn chords at that age!) Now that he's 3.5 years old the uke was too small and he asked for a larger ""guitar"" -- with a strap. After considerable investigation, this Schoenhut guitar seemed the best match for his age, size, coordination, interest. I have tuned it to an E major chord and he is proud to be on stage with his ""real guitar."" He's only had it for a month, but thus far it seems to be a good match. The intonation doesn't last, but that's to be expected with an inexpensive instrument. My goal for him is to retain his enthusiasm for music with an instrument that to him is credible, relative to his age."
3,Not really wooden...,"This guitar advertises as a wooden guitar, but the only part that is wood is the front face. The neck, top, and back are all plastic. At least the keys work, and it seems to hold for a while when tuned. My grand-daughter loves it, and for now it's okay for her."
3,Nice sound for a beginner's guitar,"Very nice little guitar, very surprising that it comes with metal strings, which are hard on young learner's fingers. The guitar sounds great, and my boy loves to learn on it. A very good deal."
1,Beware of CREATED OPINIONS!,"}}those 2 above..telling ""GREAT MOVIE!"" , a ""VERY GOOD DIRECTED"" and all the lame stuff they said...exactly 2 days after amazon posted this Movie...is bollocks!the suposedly FILmFANATIC, has only reviewed this film? Whoo do you think you can fool? are you expecting soem rushinmg buyer to go for your movie? COme On! hahaha"
5,At Last! Databases Explained Clearly!,"By far the best intro to databases I've ever seen, and having spent years as a technical writer for Oracle databases, I've seen plenty. The author makes even difficult database concepts easy to understand. He shares a career's worth of wisdom about the database industry in enlightening ways. This book provides the clearest overview of the field (from what is a database toStructured Query Language to the latest database technologies). You can even test your learning with the sample quizzes. This should be required reading at every database company! Ideal fordatabase novices and useful even for database professionals who are not versed in every database speciality."
5,"One of the most entertaining, laugh out loud Hank books ever",Of all the dog heroes in the world Hank is by far our favorite. He takes his job as head of ranch security very seriously. It's funny but also touching to see Hank strive to maintain his dignity as he suffers the consequences of inserting his nose (in a pipe) before putting his brain in gear. I have read Hank books with my kids for years and this one had me taking more time outs for laughing than any of the others. I couldn't help but read the last chapter myself after the kids were in bed and thoroughly enjoyed the surprise ending.
5,The best of the best...,"Yes, there are other beautiful fountain pens out there that work beautifully, but nothing I've ever owned, including Montegrappa, Visconti, Aurora, Sailor, Waterman, Delta, Omas, or high end Parker and Sheaffer pens actually write better than either of my Pelikan 600's. Most don't write quite as consistently well. The Pelikan's an old style converter-only pen, but probably because of that, there are never any issues with getting it to write. If I use it at least once a week it writes immediately. I like fountain pens in general, but if I'm taking one with me to sign documents, write a letter, or make notes, it's going to be one of two models of pen-the Pelikan 600 or the Waterman Carene (another utilitarian winner, for sure!). Oh-from my experience, don't bother with Mont Blanc. Overpriced, unreliable, leaky, fussy and inconsistent. Otherwise quite lovely. Bleccchhh!!"
1,Poorly written and poorly bound,"There are several flaws with this book. First, it is very poorly constructed and cheaply bound. Upon the first opening the pages will fall out. Second, the pictures are not very well executed and printed. Washed out colors, uninspiring pictures. Usually, good cookbooks will carry photographs that come close to food porn. Not in this book. Lastly, some recipes are plain-out wrong. I followed the recipe for the famous Macao dish galinha portuegesa. It was a disaster. I think the author did not do her homework on this book, a poor excuse for a cookbook. Buyer beware..."
3,Not great but I am glad I bought it,"This is very much a specialty book (and thus will not have a appeal to a very wide audience outside serious foodies) and I am glad I bought it for that reason alone. There are not a lot of recipes I am likely to try, I must say, and many of the pictures are very poor indeed, but there are, in truth, not a lot of other books dealing with the obscure of Chinese-Portuguese food. It is, then, fairly unique in thus regard and I like having this in my collection as a reference."
3,Get the vaccine now!!,"3.5 - 3.75 stars!!!! U want some west coast with a different spin to it check this album out. The dude got some mic skills. His rap style is kind of hard to get into at first, but after a few listens u will be hooked. He's E40's cousin so if u don't like 40 u may want to say away from this.Honestly the beats caught my attention first. It's hyphy but gangsta!!! Every song on here is not tight but the good out ways the bad. Hotep!!"
2,Only for beginners,"Like someone else said in his review, this book is good for beginners. I'd like to confirm that, and maintain that's its ONLY good for beginners. The book glazes over much of the material and never goes in depth for any of it. If you've already had just a little experience with crystal reports already, this book won't help you much at all. It can hardly be used as a good reference."
2,Poor Quality,I got this to go with a Cinderella release poster in my daughter's room. I had them both custom framed and they look nice enough. The image on this one though is terrible quality. It must have been a very small file that someone forced up to 11x17 because its awfully pixelated. You can't tell from afar though so we'll keep it.
4,classic,"a great example of classic blues/jazz, not the smooth voice some are looking for, more along the lines of ""Satchmo"", great easy listening songs!"
4,Groove on!,"Heard about this band on NPR and had to buy the CD! This album is awesome and it is remarkable that high school aged musicians worked at this caliber; what an incredible teacher they had to inspire them! Really good grooves, excellent music to clean house to, or to listen to at a party. You can't sit still while this CD plays!"
1,WON'T EVER SHIP!,"This order has been the HUGEST pain in the ass. This product and it's inability to ship is uncharacteristic for AMAZON.I placed the order back in early July and I am still waiting for it. The pain in the ass part of it is that twice a week I get an email asking me if I still want it and to ""approve"" the delay.It is so annoying.I loved this movie. I loved the music and the story behind the music in a part of town I never knew growing up in Houston.I can't wait to hear the songs but I am about to give up.Order this if you have a Metric Crap Ton of patience and you are not in a hurry."
5,A Funky A+ for The Band and its Leader,"As a child I would sit on the floor next to the ""jukebox"" and listen to the selections ... music has always been one of the most fulfilling and memorable experiences of my life ... this CD makes a clear case for why I feel this way ... great charts, fantastic musicians, a visionary band leader, and heartfelt ""right on"" funk played by teenagers inspired and excited by a chance to do it their way under the guidance of Conrad Johnson. He has left a legacy like none other by recording these award winning renditions from the popular music of the day. His students and their music represent the highest achievement possible, a rhythmic and percussive testimonial and tribute to the groove of the 1960s and 1970s. One listen will convince you that everyone who contributed to these recordings lived up to their potential ... a riff-oriented A+ listening experience!"
5,LOve Ben Jelen,He is simply the best. I cannot help it and listen to him all the time. so soothing and lifting and pure and unadulterated feel good music . it's like music for the soul for me. you gotta try and listen to him. I have never liked a cd as much as I like this. I am so glad my friend told me how good he is and now I am spreading the word too.Ben is one of the more impressive singer/songwriters around and his music is so sensitive and lyrical. and his voice is like a voice from heaven.
5,Nifty Book!,"I have to say I very much enjoyed reading this book. It is a good reference and an enjoyable book to read overall. It is helping me and my brother in our business of recruiting computer-related professionals. It has a little bit for everyone, so I can tell everyone who is interested that it has something for you! You will see what I mean when you get your hands on a copy."
3,It made a great door stop.,"Honestly, I have no idea whats in this book, i ordered it and my professor never used it once. So it sat in my door and collected dust. That was my first mistake...After a few weeks the book went missing and didn't turn up again until the end of the semester. By that time, i found it four stories down from my window in a bush. I was partially burned and covered in coke-a-cola. To this day I have no idea what happened to this book."
5,Chilling and awakening.,"This excellently researched and lucidly written dissection of the development and activities of the Psychiatric establishment was immediately a favorite. If Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward met Stephen King and pursued the trail of madness and subsidized chaos they could not have surpassed Mr. Wiseman's straightforward and gripping exposition of the development of influence and and power by the Psyciatric elite. Here he lays out clearly the methods in creating madness, subsidy and more madness. I cannot recommend this highly enough as an enjoyable and enlightening addition to the aware and concerned person's library."
5,The frightening truth about the Psychiatric Industry,"""Psychiatry: The Ultimate Betrayal"" examines psychiatry from its beginnings to its current state. It dissects and evaluates the philosophy of psychiatry and the various treatments used by psychiatrists. It gives the actual facts about the results obtained by psychiatry and is a vital reference for anyone considering undergoing any type of psychiatric or psychological treatment.The book is called ""The Ultimate Betrayal"" for good reason. As you read you realize that this profession is not just harming under the guise of help, but is destroying minds and lives as a normal part of its activities.This is probably the best researched book I have ever read. Every fact is backed up with its source. It is well written and riveting but be prepared, Steven King is mild indeed compared to the evil of psychiatry."
5,Worth Every Dime and Then Some!,This book is excellent as an assigned complement to course text for statistics courses. It is invaluable not only for navigating SPSS but it is useful for visual learners as a guide to understanding and connecting theory with practice as you move through your coursework.
1,Contains very little useful information,I own a number of Access 97 books at different levels from teach yourself up to the Developers Handbook. This is the book I have found to contain the least useful information. Do yourself a favor and look at other books.
3,A Rip and a Rip,"A decent enough collection of some of Bowie's hits but let me tell you that you will not be able to rip these songs into your personal library. After paying for the CD, I'm expected to download the digital version of the album? Come on, it's like they're asking people to steal music! Bah."
3,what were they thinking?,"I was so happy with the idea of this two disc set when i purchased it, even though it was missing a couple of songs i would have liked to be on there. after listening to it, though, i discovered that several songs had been shortened to allow everything to fit onto two discs. there is a full TWO MINUTES cut from Young Americans. there is no mention of any editing from the original versions on the outside of the disc."
2,too many same-sounding recent songs,"This was in a $10 Specials bin in a Sydney CD store, so I'd thought I'd try it (saw that it had Space Oddity and The Jean Genie).Very disappointing - not that I was ever a real Bowie fan, but I did own one vinyl album called ""Space Oddity"" which had a few Really good tracks on it. None of those tracks (except for the title track) are on this ""Best of"".""Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed"", ""Janine"", and a truly Beautiful acoustic guitar track whose title I forget, but the lyrics began......""The hand that wrote this letter sweeps the pillow cleanSo rest your head and dream a treasure dream..."" etc.None of those 3 excellent tracks are on this so-called ""Best Of"", but there are lots of samey-sounding 80s & post-80s (but they still sound 80s) C-grade tracks.A real disappointment for me."
2,WARNING: Songs Have Been Edited on this Album,"I'm a big Bowie fan and overall this is a decent collection of his works. The two disc set has a better selection, but I liked that this single disc spanned his early to later hits. The sound quality is good.HOWEVER, I was VERY disappointed to notice that several songs have been edited. They've been shortened to presumably include more songs on this single CD. A couple of instrumental parts within songs have been shortened (such as in Young Americans) and the endings of some songs have been truncated. This really bothers me.If you're new to Bowie and don't know his music yet, this probably a good way to get a sample. If you know and love these songs, the edits might just drive you nuts. They sure bug me."
2,OK but nothing great,"I'm always amazed when people proclaim the greatness of Bowie. The truth is, no matter how innovative he was at the time/now and how great his voice is(and it really is), his stuff is mostly boring and weird. That said, Ashes to ashes and Loving the Alien are two of the best tracks I've ever heard.* Preparing to be flamed for this review."
5,The best album of one of the best musicans in the world.,"The master in music who had once co-operated in producing music with John Lennon, Queen, Marc Bolan, Mick Ronson, Iggy Pop, Pet Shop Boys, Moby, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Lou Reed, Robert Fripp, Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rogers, Bing Crosby, Brian Eno...to name but a few. What can you expect more?Heroes, Stand up! Salute to the man who fell to earth.Who is it? Ziggy Stardust? A clown once dressed in white? Thin white Duke? Nathan Adler? Screaming Lord Byron? A D.J? Jack Celier? Aladdin Insane? Newton? Spider from Mars? A Diamond dog?He is a man who never lost control.Just look at the cover of this CD, you are face to face with the man who sold the world."
4,"Oh! No, There's no Cat People Here...!","Cat People (Putting Out Fire) should be in this CD, it's much better than some weak tracks like Dancing In The Streets. If you are just a casual fan and want only the best tracks from David Bowie, you'll pick this one. I think this single CD version is The Best of his Best. If you want more, maybe the 2 discs version is a bargain.I haven't bought this CD yet, but I'm considering it for its sound quality and almost all his best tracks are here (Let's Dance, China Girl, Modern Love). Fortunately, I can still find Cat People elsewhere in its better and long single version.I Just Want To Say:Dancing In The Streets; with Mick Jagger (just ordinary)Under Pressure; with Queen (a fantastic collaboration)Cat People (Putting Out Fire); outstanding! at least there're two versions. Music by Giorgio Moroder and Stevie Ray Vaughan on guitar, OST of Cat People movie."
2,A producer's sick joke,"Yes, this disc contains some great hits, but wastes its time with material (Dancing in the Street) that I really think is second tier at best. Also, what kind of a way is it to end a CD for an American release with ""This is not America"" and ""I'm Afraid of Americans."" This is obviously a stupid inside joke."
5,Bowie's My Hero,"I absolutely love this 2 CD collection of all of David Bowie's works over the years. The music is timeless and the beat just makes you want to dance. My favourite songs are ""Under Pressure"", ""Modern Love"", ""Rebel Rebel"" and I love the upbeat feel of this CD. Thank you Amazon for a great collection!"
1,"Oh God, my eyes are bleeding","Never have I been complelled to write a review, but I must warn my compatriots to stay away from this movie. What a monumental waste of time. Terrible acting with an even worse script, this movie ranks on my top 5 worst movies of all time."
3,Too Small,We found the device is a bit too small. You have to get really small onions or peel the outside layers off a big onion to get it too fit.The instructions are vague and the recipe for the batter has absolutely no flavor. The batter is also too thick and causes everything to sink in my Fry-Daddy.
3,whats with the zip?,"This girdle feels great on and shapes wonderfully. However it's let down by the zip which juts out from the silloutte as I'm not svelt anymore. I pull/roll on the girdle anyway, as it's easier, so get no benefit from the zip. Aside from that it hugs you just right with plenty of stretch so you can move freely. My next will be the rago 389."
1,not good,"in an extremely boring account of something that Frayn obviously bulled his way through, readers can actually feel brain cells withering away. there is absolutely nothing in this play worth reading, unless you want to hear endless puns about heisenberg's uncertainty principle. it really doesn't get funnier the more you say it. how this play managed to win a tony, i don't know. all i know is that i use my copy to train my puppy."
2,Whatever Wanda Wanted,"Wanda always had whatever Wanda wanted. Well, almost. ""The one thing Wanda didn't have was friends."" That, and a magnificent kite a shopkeeper won't sell her. Until she throws one of her patented tantrums. He warns her of its mystical powers, but, oops, too late, it sweeps her into the sky and drops her off on a deserted island. There, she learns how to survive without clothes, toys, and television. Once she realizes she only yearns for mom and dad, she returns home for a group hug. As Wanda says, ""There's more to life than things!"" The illustrations are funky day-glo cartoons that will amuse young and old. Unfortunately, the sly text gives way to sudden sappiness as the story progresses, and the island scenes seem to be abrupt and unconvincing. Still, this book would be helpful in teaching children about materialism."
4,excellent background to the battle,"Overall, this proves to be a very readable book on the Campaign of Isandlwana. The background information involving the troops, Zulus and politics proves to be very informative and well written. Even the aftermath of the battle proves to be quite good as the authors' researched revealed many aspects of interest. However, I wasn't too impressed with the way the author wrote the battle. The maps - while very colorful, wasn't every effective. Description of the battle failed to convey the situation very clearly. I would recommend Zulu Victory by Ron Lock for the best written account of the battle and this book for the best written background material to the battle. If you read both books, you should have an excellent understanding of the entire Isandlwana campaign."
4,Element Eighty Rocks!,This new guitar dominated band is definitely heavy metal with a great sound. This CD will get you on your feet!!!!
3,not too bad,"i guess i got this cd on the word of some friends. i think it's a pretty good cd; my favorites are broken promises and scars, aka the echo song. but still, something about the screaming in all of the songs...maybe it's just me, but i've heard too many songs that scream incessantly (linkin park anybody?), so i guess that's turning me away from the cd.give it time and it grows on you, but i can't give it more than a three."
2,Good sound but...,"...this headset is just too uncomfortable for me to wear for long periods of time. The hard plastic ear pieces make my ear canal hurt like I've poked a Q-Tip in them. Perhaps I'm trying to keep the headset too close to my ears, but if I don't then sound escapes (they are NOT noise-cancelling) and makes picking up the audio more difficult. As long as these things are jammed into my ears then I've been able to pick up even some of the worst quality audio when transcribing. Also, the ""V"" shape of the stethoscope hits against the upper part of my chest (just below the collarbone) which easily dislodges the earpieces. If the ""V"" was shorter then I don't think I'd have this issue. All in all, I'll have to keep the product as the seller doesn't accept returns that aren't defective, so I'll probably look for some soft earbud covers to try lessening the pain. I wouldn't recommend these for transcriptionists (the target consumer) who have to have a headset on for hours at a time."
2,Rob Tyner - 'Blood Brothers' (R & A Records),"Pretty much aimed towards the MC 5 die-hards and completists. Liked his 'Rock 'N Roll People' Japanese import CD a lot better {see my review}. Only tracks here I thought showed any promise were his Stones cover ""It's Only Rock And Roll"" and ""Grande Days"". Look in cut-out bins first. Believe I found a copy for like $2.00."
2,warning shadows a nocturnal hallucination,"this is a do over of a old 60s english movie the story line is boring and slow has necked women,about the only good thing if you like this anyway in my openion i spent too much on a old boring movie"
5,I hope this never breaks on me!,"I love this camera. I bought it this year. I bought all the options afterward; MB-10, MF-26 and SB-26. I use it as my primary camera. I'd buy another one. I recommend this."
4,do you have hurty feelings?,Fragility is a hippo who is very insecure. Her friends give her nice compliment but she always takes them as insults. Fragility cries all the time and her friends start to avoid her. Things change for Fragility one day when she decides to stand up to the neighborhood bully Rudy the elephant. Find out how Fragility turns her life around and learns some important like lessons.What did you like or not like about the book?We felt that the book could be used to start various discussions on feelings. Also the topic of bullies could be brought up as well after reading this cute picture book.Yes. The cover shows a big hippo crying and using up boxes full of tissues.Itdraws you in and makes you want to read to book to see what is wrong with her.
3,Not as good as others by Helen Lester,"This book is not one of our favorites. It is not up to the level of A Porcupine Named Fluffy, Listen Buddy and Me First. Those are some of our favorite books by this author. They are humorous as well as teaching a nice lesson to your preschoolers."
4,Only book I have found on this important subject,"a must read for those considering travel to the polar regions. This unbiased and informative book will open your eyes to the risks you are about to take when going on one of these ""safe"" ships."
1,think about it,"a product like this makes great sense ,but not one that is only 75 min long.i ride 50 -60 min a day at home 5-6 days a week.you need a west coast tour ,a cross country tour or your getting bored real soon."
2,"Bad quality, good idea.","Maybe if they mount something a bit newer to their suv, like the hero 2 gopro, (which is only a 300 dollar investment) try slowing down a bit, (in some spots it feels like 50mph) and maybe take a break on a real bike and mount that little camra and do the monterey lovers key bike ride, or ride around big basin, just throw a couple of real bike rides in there along with the driving, then...you get a hit. Its a great idea with a much needed upgrade."
3,does not like the hills,"The problem with this indoor cycling video is that every time a hill is approached there is a change in scenery (to birds, sealife, etc.). There are some long downhill jaunts, but whoever edited this video edited out all of the climbs. There is frequently a sense of a hill approaching ahead and the suddenly, you are at the top of the hill. I would recommend this video for simulated downhill skiing."
3,The Heavy stuff is great...,"This one of my favorite current dance CDs, along with mr.deviant's ""Techno Obsession"".Dance Divas 2 brings more current tracks to the collection, unlike vol. 1 which contained a lot of stuff we've already heard before. I really dig the heavy stuff on this CD (I just love hardfloor and hard edge dance music, like mr.deviant's stuff), but the CD has too many light tracks to keep me from giving it a higher rating. Still worth the money, but should have been filled with 100% hardtracks."
4,Great as a companion,"Interesting and full of new information, this book is a great complement to other general histories of the war. The focus is very much social history, so on its own it's rather narrow, but combined with something more traditional (or a standard textbook knowledge of the American Revolution), it works. There are whole chapters on how slaves, women, American Indians, etc. experienced the war, all of which is a reminder of how diverse and total the war was. Everyone was affected and a great many people suffered horrible. Some things never change."
4,Excellent made-for-TV movie for a Sunday afternoon!,"First I must say, this is not quite your typical made-for-tv movie: it didn't feel like it was made low-budget & I thought the cast did very well. I saw a preview for this on TV one day, & set my Tivo to record it: I was so glad I did! The storyline was well-written, & just when I thought I had figured out the movie & knew the ending, I was wrong: it kept me guessing the entire time!It was heartfelt, moving & even funny: but definitely bring a box of tissues when you watch this one, as it is a bit of a tear-jerker as well. I was expecting them to follow the atypical sappy romance formula, without much originality (a type of movie I happen to love anyways), but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie in: the script, the cast & the quality.All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a romantic at heart!"
1,Bad,"The entire plot was taken from a movie Sliding Doors, which is much better movie, with a better ending. It was interesting, but depressing."
3,the lead lady wasn't that great,"loved the story, great acting by the lead male. With another actress it would have been a lot better I think. nice watch food for thought. how to live life in a different, more intense and honest way, especially with the ones we love. There's not much time...."
2,All I Didn't Want To Finish,"Between the scripture, reciting of sins, and the constant backward motion I lost momentum. Not one of Austin's best stories."
5,WONDERFUL!!! A must have for all who read The Cheerleader,"I really enjoyed all three books. I really feel like I know all these people and I feel like I could run into Snowy at the store or something!! Its wonderful to see what happened to a number of folks from Gunwaithe High.I would say that I would like yet another book on her, but they are getting so old that the next book would have their deaths, and I sure don't want to read that. :-)Thank you Ruth for a wonderful trilogy of books!!"
5,hey,ya i dont have the cd i was just listening to it on here. its crazy how similar she sounds the the be good tanyas. strange--even a little freaky. sounds good though : )
1,Disappointing...,"I was excited to read this book about a Yup'ik Eskimo village in the 1890s. Minuk, the narrator, is 12 and tells the story. It seems interesting...a missionary family arrives to ""civilize"" her people. However, characters were introduced so fast and then pushed aside, that it left me wondering...""who was that?"" I did like the little bit of historical information at the end, but that was probably the best part of the book. Otherwise it moved to fast and the leaves the reader feeling like we never really get to know Minuk."
3,eould never buy again,"yea i lost 4 pounds in three days! The bad part..it gave me the worst stomach cramps i ever felt! it hurt to walk, lay down and everything. i thought it would go away in time but it only got worse. i lost weight quick without exercising but it was not worth it"
2,Not the right book for you,"This book is not good at anything in particular especially if you are doing or planning to do any kind of digital photography. It seems to me that the author is not a very good architectural photographer himself because most of the pictures you see in the book are terrible, even when used to ilustrate different points. When it comes to digital photography he speaks like he knows very little about what is possible to do today with a digital camera.Not a source of inspiration or good complete information for anybody seriously getting into architectural photography.First time I return a book to Amazon."
3,IT JUST MISSES.,"Roz Russell was a good actress but she couldn't sing very well. So her singing in GYPSY was dubbed by Lisa Kirk. Unfortunately, not very well dubbed. It would have been much wiser if the great Ethel Merman had starred (as she did on Broadway). This part BELONGS to Merman. Natalie Wood is great. Karl Malden overacts shamelessly- pretty bad. Ann Jillian is wonderful. Everyone else is good.For the best Mama Rose on video, get Bette Midler-a superb performance."
3,"Decent, But Lacking Something.","Rosiland Russell is one of the best dramatic actresses of all time. Tragicly, this is a musical. Trouper that she is, she gives it her all, as do her co-stars Natalie Wood and Karl Malden. However, none of them can really carry a tune, and without a strong musical base, the classic Jule Styne-Stephen Sondheim score doesn't get fair treatment. Luckly, everyone in this movie has spunk and dramatic presence, so it isn't a disaster. Regardless, one has to feel like this could have been much better. How could they turn down Ethel Merman for the part of Mama Rose! To hear how this show should sound, buy the original cast album."
3,Sophisticated musical lacks zip,"An unusually sophisticated musical based on the memoirs of striptease artiste Gypsy Rose Lee. Well acted by Rosalind Russell, Karl Malden, and Natalie Wood but it lacks zip - the fake looking sets don't help, neither does Rosalind Russell's obvious lip synching - and when you see Gypsy Rose Lee's idea of stripping in the latter part of the film you will wonder what all the fuss was about."
4,MOVE OVER SLOBERBONES!,"Man, I don't know what all the [...]is about - I like this album - I would have gave it a 4 1/2 star review if it were possible. These are freakin solid songs. So hey - ""Drams"" - you keep on truck'n. And all you sloberbones - be thankful these dudes are still putting out great music. In other words - DON'T HATE! And anyone who has not heard this LP - give it a listen - it deserves it. Solid! Peace - Out"
2,So and so Porsche 356 book.,Lots of detail description thru-out the years of the 356. Good for telling the differences between the years. No history and introduction. No color pictures. Could not find any information about the specs of the various engines supplied thru the years. There are some guessing in the book which is always a no-no for publishing a book like this.
4,Great book,"At first I dind't like the layout of this book. But after I had a better feel for the program, I haven't looked back since. Great book!"
5,"I haven't tried following any of the patterns yet, but......","this book didn't disappoint me. For craft project books I look first to large, lush photographs to inspire me, and then to easy-to-understand instructions on materials and how to assemble. This book has it all. These projects could all be reproduced fairly exactly by a reader, but it's up to you to tweak and make it your own. I especially love the fountain that uses building material foam to sculpt a little mini-volcano with areas for tealights and plants. Recommended!"
5,"SOY UN SACAT""N AN""NIMO...PERO NO","QUIERO QUE MI SEÑORA SE ENTERE DE QUE MI NEGOCIO LOMANEJA ESTA MUJER A TRAVES DE SU MARAVILLOSO LIBRO!Te la recomiendo, amigo..pero que no se entere su esposa!!Son BUENAS DE CELOSAS..PERO LOS CONSEJOS ADMINISTRATIVOS DE ESTE LIBRO, LE VAN A ENCANTAR CUANDO LOS VEA CONVERTIDOS EN UN COCHE NUEVO !"
1,NOT a generic adapter for Orion mounts,"Beware of ordering this adapter for your Orion mount. Though it doesn't say so, this adapter is meant only for one specific mount model, I believe the Sky View Pro. Call Orion to verify.I ordered this adapter with the Orion EQ-2 mount through Amazon, and Orion sent this wrong adapter anyway. You will have to pay the return shipping to Orion and the new adapter shipping, about $11 together, though they did return the original extra $1.25 shipping for the wrong adapter.Note that I only chose a one star rating because I had to choose something, but it is meaningless since I was unable to use it."
5,Best Tarps We Have Found Yet!,"We cover all our canopies here at FLOWERWOOD DACHSHUNDS so that they last longer. We have found if we put Dry Top Super Heavy Duty Tarps over them they last for years. The Dry Top Tarps are the best we have found, far superior to other tarps on the market. They last in the Ocala, Fla. sun for a year or more. Thank you Dry Top for your strong, well made tarps."
4,A NICE READ,"THIS IS THE STORY OF WILLIE MAYS BASEBALL GREAT. IN HIS OWN WORDS, WILLIE DESCRIBES HIS CAREER IN BASEBALL WITH THE GIANTS AND HIS RETURN TO THE METS IN THE EARLY 1970'S. HE DOES A NICE JOB TELLING OF THE 1951 PENNANT RACE, THE CATCH DURING THE 1954 WORLD SERIES AND HIS RELATIONSHIPS WITH VARIOUS MANAGERS. HE TOUCHES MOSTLY ON LEO DUROCHER, ALVIN DARK AND HERMAN FRANKS. WILLIE KEEPS HIS PERSONAL LIFE TO MINIMUM. HE HAS HAD A DIVORCE, FINANCIAL PROBLEMS, WHICH SHOWS THAT HE IS AS HUMAN AS ALL OF US. TO ME HE WAS THE GREATEST ALL AROUND PLAYER I HAVE EVER SEEN. WILLIE IS A LIKEABLE GUY AND I ENJOYED THIS BOOK VERY MUCH. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS WILLIE SAYS SAY HEY."
2,Buy the OXO instead!,I agree with the previous review. Not rigid enough. Pay the extra and buy the OXO Good Grip's version.They still cost less than a dropped steak.
1,Would not order this again,"I ordered this in red, and it is not as pretty in real life as it is in the amazon picture. The big reason for the low rating, though, is that the quality of hte product is not what I expected. In particular, the tongs are not rigid enough for my use. The silicone bends under normal pressure and that makes it difficult to use. also the metal scrapes on metal when i pull the open/close latch in and out, which can sound like fingers down a chalkboard."
3,25 Classic Doo Wop Ballads,"I love Doo Wop! This album was a little disappointing because many of the ""ballads"" I had never heard before. However, I play my ""oldies"" in my car (my husband hates Doo Wop) and have enjoyed this CD in spite of not being familiar with all the songs."
5,hunters of the shadows,"Haeusers story is a real page turner!The surprise twists and alot of action promise to keep you up reading all night! His characters are hard to resist, true to their great loyalties of their ancestors,and venturing into anything and everything and with great senses of humor that made me laugh out loud!""Creed"", Jacob Reid and ""Rasmere"" are unforgettable characters that I would love to see in the next ""Hunters"" book! Sue"
2,Lame movie,This movie was just lameWeak plots and weak jokes IExcepted more from this movieSince it starred Eddie Murphy
5,A Must See,"Very Funny!Ok so its one of those stupid, funny movies but you cant help but laugh !My 2yr old loves it to she quotes parts of the movies its so cute."
4,DVD - Military Take Over,"An excellent review of what Military banch trys to take over executive branch. Black and White Start Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas ---- I worn out 3 rd of copy......"
5,Burt Lancaster's Protrayal,"Burt Lancaster's Protrayal Of A General Who's Trying To Commit A ""coup e'tat"" In The United States Is Excellent! Burt Lancaster's Performance In ""Seven Days In May"" Is Equalled Only By His Later Protrayal Of A Rogue General In ""Twilight's Last Gleaming!"" Burt Lancaster Is Undoubtedly One Of The Most Under-Rated Actors Of the 20th Century! Kirk Douglas, Fredric March, & Ava Gardner Give High Stellar Performances In This Suspense Political Thriller! Definately A 5-Star Movie!"
3,decent introduction for the uninitiated,"I thought this book was a good primer on US special ops forces, although by no means exhaustive. Gives the histories, training, and capabilities of the various US SpecOps forces. I did think it could use more detail in some areas (eg. SEAL team Six and DEVGROUP) which were glossed over. I did like the inclusion of the 82 Airborne, 101st Airborne, and 10th Mountain Division, which aren't technically SpecOps forces, but do have specialized abilities and missions, and also the CIA paramilitary forces. All in all, the book is good for the uninitiated reader, but those with some knowledge will probably want to refer elsewhere."
5,Great Teen Read,"I absolutly LOVED this book. Fianlly a book that foucus's on issues like suidcide and eating dissorder, mixed in with a dash of death and I pinch of friend/relationship. Its the perfect combination for the recipe of teenager. It was a great self help book and a great read all at the same time. I have to say that all the Chicken Soup for the Teen Soul books are great. I own them all but this one has really touched home and helped me to connect with the authors. I definetly recommend this book to anyone who is interested especially teens. I think that this book, being as it focus's more on the rougher aspects of being a teen, will help alot more teens. Just read the first story.... bet you can't put it down..."
4,tough stuff,I thoguht that this book was great. Im sure that it will help many with its stories and my favorite part the poems. The only thing that I wish it had was tough stuff about love because being in highschool I know how hard haveing a relationship can be. This book is just awesome. I would defintally recommend this as a christmas gift for the teens.
1,FInd another company to order from,"The mask looks NOTHING like the picture - it is a different mask entirely. Judging from the reviews of others, I won't even bother trying to return it, but don't buy from these people."
5,the good doctor's journal,"Classic Hunter. More of a collection of stories than a singular novel, this book best portrays Thompson's chaotic and lucid writing.It's like a combination of two great HST movies, Where The Buffalo Roam and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. A literary classic, IMHO"
5,I lover it!,"It's clean, clear, compact and easy. I don't want any more from a machine than that. I'd buy another one in a minute."
4,Television top shelf,"This item works fairly well, although we had to buy some non slip, rubber matting to put under it as otherwise it would try to slip off. But with that under it, my cats have jumped up on it and it has yet to fall."
4,Excellent Product,Well.. I did not have space for my receiver and my DVD recorder. I did not want to put them inside the entertaiment center so this shelf is very useful. Everything is as I like to be.Thanks
1,Can't use,When I recieved this item it was in it's original flimsy box that was beaten up and opened at one end. Now I am missing a piece so I can't really use this at the time. I'm hoping some one contacts me and sends the the other leg. We will see.
5,great item,"I received this product very quickly, it was very easy to set up and use.Just what I needed."
3,"Unlikely Adventure - Fast-paced, but predictable","This novel jumps from one unlikely coincidence to the next with astonishing rapidity, pitting unbelievable semi-noir characters against one another in ever widening coils of intrigue...Reverend Miles and the ""Come to Jesus Cruiser"" must face off against ""Fat Boy,"" Columbian drug lords, a beautiful woman named ""Stormy Lake"" and his own brother to save his mission on Andros and avenge the death of ""Moon Beam,"" the local wacko bird lobster diver. Worth your time if you are in need of a diversion, but not really memorable."
4,Useful for a party,"Put in the disc, hit ""Play All"" and forget about it. The scenes repeat. I play my own music and the TV room has a nice glow without the distracting chance of people actually watching a program."
2,Must have for New Order fans ONLY,"The majority of this DVD, visually, is pretty non-descript. It's essentially color in motion. Music is so relaxing it should be in a spa, in which case you wouldn't see the video cuz you're sleeping!! Only a true Peter Saville fan and/or New Order fan can appreciate this but, although I do, it is not a must buy. Peter Saville is a graphic genius, that being said, go buy a book about him...and if you must, borrow this DVD from a friend and burn it."
1,Get a box of bandaids because you're gonna need them,"Another reviewer stated his fingers were sliced up pretty bad after using this for a few minutes, then said it was his fault. Well believe me, it was NOT his fault - this thing is a menace. On paper, this thing looks pretty good. I mean, it'll strip about every kind of wire out there - and it does a marvelous job at it too. The UTP adjuster doesn't have click stops on it, so after you throw it in the box it'll get all out of adjustment, but that only takes 2-3 tries next time out to readjust it.But those exposed razors have just got to go. If you think you're slick enough to maneuver around those 7 spinning razors then your ego is just way ahead of you. You WILL get cut working with this thing. If you're not careful, they can be pretty deep cuts also.Now if they'd pack a handful of bandaids with this unit then I'd consider more than a 0 star review, otherwise give it to someone you hate for a Christmas present or something"
5,Perfect Inexpensive Tool,An absolute must when working with cable ends. Impossible to get along without tis little tool. Waited too long to buy it and experienced lot of frustration without it. When I read review by cable guys there was not doubt this is the right tool for the job.
1,Iguana toy,"Much, much smaller than I expected - hardly worth the price! Save your money and buy something else (try Wikki Stix)"
3,"Nice light, but sipping needs to improve","So the light is nice, it's a not quite as bright as i was expecting, but it's a nice, clean light fixture. Only tricky thing for us is that to replace the bulb, you need to slide the curved glass part out from the top - but if you have something interfering and blocking the top you need to get a little creative. What I am upset about - shipping from amazon was a bit of a nightmare. Multiple units arrived broken. We needed these for our downtown loft that we moved out of and decided to rent, and since I wasn't able to do the walk-through my husband did. He didn't notice the conrtractor missed installing a light, and he didn't install because yet another one arrived broken (this was a replcement i ordered last minute and needed to ship ASAP to arrive in time and i didn't get a chance to confirm it arrived undamaged). Very frustrating. If you order, make sure you have enought time before you install to send back and reorder more if you need to."
1,Please do let America laugh,"Words cannot describe how awful and unfunny this DVD is. There is very little stand up in this video--it's mostly a documentary that follows Cross around to po-dunk clubs where people heckle him and then Cross sort of ridicules the hecklers but not in a funny way.I am astounded that this was not only conceived of, but then executed, produced, and sold. This DVD's mere existence demonstrates Mr. Cross's utter contempt for his audience, as well as a sense of self importance that might make even Kanye West blush. If I could give this DVD negative stars, I would."
2,David Cross - Let America Laugh,"I thought this was just alright. Funny in parts, monotonous in other areas, & there was a whole lot of boring at the end. Had way higher expectations for it and felt rather let down over the whole lack of laughter I felt."
4,BRANSON CHRISTMAS CARD,"THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY CHRISTMAS SHOW, THAT I THINK ALL OF THE FAMILYWILL ENJOY, WITH BOXCAR WILLIE A LEGEND. LOTS OF CHRISTMAS SPIRIT ANDJUST AN ALL AROUND ENJOYABLE SHOW."
4,Nice product,"This is a very nice-looking product. It's useful as a back rest with cupholder. Also, the added massaging feature is great, although it could be a little more powerful."
2,HoMedics Back rest,"I purchased this for comfort, but I found it to be extremely Hard and very un-comfortable. I ended up giving it to my Grandson who sits on the floor to watch TV. He loves the massager.HoMedics Foldable Massaging Back Rest"
3,Homedic chair,"The chair is ok. I was not pleased with the vibration component being so close to the surface of the backing. It has a really hard spot where this is located, and does hurt your back after several hours of sitting I use mine to study for my nursing classes so I spend alot of time with it. I just place a big blanket between the back and myself and it is okThe arms seems a little flimsy but for what you pay for it I guess it is worth it"
3,Luke-warm,"Quite obviously another Grand Central label release, and sometimes as good as the wonderful ""Northern Sulphuric Soul"", Cold Water Music suffers from having too many similar tracks. When the hip-hop/traditional song formula works at its best, like on Sail, the effect is beautiful - Kate Rogers's haunting vocals perfectly underpinned by weighty beats. When it doesn't come off quite so well, it sounds just average, and Demonic is a terrible, orchestral goth-horror-hop abomination. Too much of the rest of the album lacks invention, although Ain't Got Time To Waste flows along nicely and holds interest. Disappointing, considering the quality of some of the stuff Grand Central puts out."
1,What a poor CD,"Please all of you who already wrote some reviews, u have to admit that Kate Miner does not sing very well, the music is not original at all and u should buy any other folk or country CD which would be much better. When i need to worship god i really prefer to do it with good music! And i prefer to listen to good music that has nothing to do with God than listen to this very bad music!"
5,"Oustanding addition to my Orion 10"" Dob","In short, if you have an Orion SkyQuest scope, you need this device. It is easy to use, very accurate and immeasurably helpful in locating Messier and deep sky objects that you might not ever find. It is particularly useful in suburban skies like mine, which suffer from moderate light pollution. It allows you to get a quick fix on targets when secondary stars can be difficult to pinpoint as a frame of reference. Well worth the investment."
5,it doesn't get any better than this,"I bought this CD on 2002 after seeing them perform on Craig Kilborn, then the next week live at the Warped Tour. Every bit of energy from their live show is captured in this CD. From start to finish there is not one less than stellar song, they're all exceptional. From the beginning of the title track on, the drums pound at your chest & only take a cigarette break for the last few tracks. Even the mandolins, violins, banjos, & accordian have a 'punkish' fury to them.It doesn't matter what type of music you like, you will love this CD & love Flogging Molly. I've played this CD for dozens of people having musical tastes from country to classical to traditional celtic & i've not met one person who doesn't love it.So buy this CD & their earlier release Swagger & spread the word of Flogging Molly!"
4,IT WONT LET YOU STOP MOVING!!,if youre going to listen to this make sure ur drunk or alone cuz youll end up getting up and dancing HAHAHAgreat cdmy grandpa likes it just because hes very irish xD.best songs:Drunken LullabiesWhat's Left of the FlagThe Kilburn High RoadRebels of the Sacred Heart (takes awhile to get into)Swaggergo get it!
4,Good stuff,"This is a good video, he suggests you play extremely tight and the starting hands chart that comes with it pretty much says dont play anything less then AA, AK, KK, KQ, QQ, JJ, or pocket pairs. As a poker student, I believe that he is just giving you a solid place to start, and the follow up dvd to this one will have info on playing hands other then the ones mentioned above.I think this is a great video if you are a beginner, and decent if you consider yourself lower to mid intermediate level. I think the lesson learned for me was to not play junk hands, which isnt a lot, but there was enough info on WHY NOT to make it worth the time and money.I have the follow up to this dvd, (MORE secrets of no limit hold 'em) ordered and I will review that one in the next week or so. Since your out shopping for dvds on holdem, I would say you wouldnt be wasting your money unless you know all about starting hands and position."
2,A missed opportunity,"Bill Werber led an interesting life on and off the field in baseball, but this collection of anecdotes from the 1930s and 40s misses the opportunity for Werber to explain how he felt about one of baseball's biggest problem in the first half of the 20th Century: segregation. Werber was a vocal opponent of integration in the 1940s and openly opposed the selection of Frank Robinson as the first African-American manager back in 1974. If Werber could have explained his positions on these matters, this book would have made a lasting impression. Instead, it just sort of floats by without making any impact."
3,A Few Bright Moments,"For the most part, this album is unexceptional CCM/pop fare. But the title track contains flashes of lyrical brilliance that make it worth enduring the overproduced music. ""We Could Be Brilliant"", ""Like Hallelujah"", and ""Take Me Away"" are also worth sampling."
1,bad bad BAD,"i rented this moving for the same reson as another poster, The piture on front. Let me first start off by saying, the acting was horrible, the story line was just plain stupid. The movie was so crappy i was irritated i actually paid to rent this. I say you are a fool to spend more than the rental price on this piece of garbage. I love a good horror flick, and believe me this wasn't!!!!"
1,I think this movie gave me cancer!!!,"Let me just go ahead and say anyone is capable of making this movie. Here's what you'll need a cheap Halloween mask and set of rubber monster hands from Wal-mart and a kid whose Kool-Aid stand just went out of buisness and is hurting for money. Personally I love B horror movies but this made me want to shove knives into my eyes, (I figure if I'm going to hurt this bad, I might as well do it to myself!) Apart from not even trying to do some semi good acting, the plot is garbage, and the running gag with the silent idiot in the mask up till the very end is terrible. It's Satan, it's Jesus, it's a cop...no it's a really crappy movie!!!! If there's anything lower than zero, that's the rating I'd give this piece of trash."
3,Creative Fun,"I really enjoy this movie. In the world of non-ultra mainstream horror, I'd classify it along the lines of mid-budget, with decent sound/picture quality and good enough acting. The concept is fun though, and Satan plays an amusing role, as well as his final metamorphosis. Its not really gory at all, which is good at times, but good fun. Not especially scary at all, but an entertaining watch."
3,Great for on the go but.....,"The i-zone is good for parties and various places on the go but I wouldn't rate it too highly because the photo size is so small. I know the idea is the create tiny little keepsakes but it means that it just isn't big enough to look at properly. The other disadvantage is the sticky film isn't very sticky at all, which defeats the purpose of that."
2,Overrated,"My biggest disappintment with this camera is the size of the pictures. They are unbearably small. Litteraly a size of a poststamp.The quality of the picture is avearge, and the camera has this annoying feature, where it turns off after every picture."
4,Fun Camera,"I use to own one of these cameras when it was originally on the market, and it was so much fun. I missed it so much, I had to replace it with this one.These cameras are great for children or parties!I have it a 4 of 5 stars because the camera is pretty basic. Turn knob to turn on, push button hard to take photo and pull out print.Have fun!*Note-any film purchased for these cameras, are going to be expired. They no longer make the film."
4,IZONE,"I got this as a gift, and I think it's great, because it's so easy, and you can buy film for it with sticky or non-stick backs. The only bad part is that even if I aim at a certain thing, the picture always takes the main focus and puts it in the corner. No matter if I center it or not. And the film is a bit pricey but it's a great way to take pictures without a lot of hassle. It's still recomended."
1,Junk,"This camera is the worst thing ever invented. The pictures are extremely small and the sticker on the back does not stick. In order for a picture to develop using the flash, one must take a picture of the subjent when they are at most 2 inches in front of the camera."
5,my favorite toy,"I've had an I-Zone camera since September, and I've had way toomuch fun playing with it. The I-Zone is great because it's easy totransport and fairly rugged. The only thing you have to watch out for is the flash setting on top - if you leave the camera in your bag or purse, something could flip the switch on and (potentially) drain your batteries. This has happened to me two or three times, but I still like to throw everything in my backpack. The I-Zone is also great because the film costs 50% less than normal Polaroids and is easy to store. I've found the camera to be more popular than me at parties, too..."
5,Recommended to lazy people. Easier then the actual book!!,"I am really lazy. I had a book report duw in one week and i hadn't even found a book yet. I picked up these cliff notes and I skimmed through them. Now, my English teacher doesn't know any better, and I have a 3.9 GPA!!! For all the lazy people out there, don't worry about doing the work, just buy the Cliff Notes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,More detail needed,"This is a good book for a would-be inventor, but it doesn't go into the detail or depth that I think is needed."
5,Family Experience,The leading Marine on the cover of this book is my father and the man behind with the BAR was a member of his fire team. My father told me about his experiences in Korea from the Pusan Perimeter to the Inchon landing ending with the Chosin Reservoir and his long recovery from his injuries. This book will help keep my fathers memory and experiences alive for my family's children and grandchildren. My father knew Mr. Duncan and enjoyed his company during these times.
2,Was it done in the basement or the attic?,"Steven himself says that it took him just a couple of hours to produce each song, so no surprises there but it would have been helpful if his comment was part of the product description. That way it would have set the expectations."
5,I cut my nail off,This is just a bread knife but I literally sliced into my thumb nail with it. It cuts bread perfectly and can even slice very thin pieces. I bought this for my boyfriend and loved his so much I bought one for myself!
5,Amazing value,"Don't bother dropping $80+ on a bread knife from some of the more well known knife brands (e.g. Wusthof, Global, etc.), even though this is a stamped knife it works like a charm. I definitely wouldn't go any smaller than this 10.25"" model, especially if you eat a lot of artisan bread that can be rather large in diameter. It cuts through tough crusts with ease, and I haven't crushed a single loaf yet. Just yesterday I stacked 8 pitas on top of each other and easily cut the stack into quarters for pita chips. I even started to multitask with it; it's great for slicing large roasts and cutting up sandwiches as well.A wonderful knife to complement any kitchen."
5,Best Bread Knife,"This is a great buy. Performs better then knives twice the price. As a home baker, this knife works equally as well on soft and crusty breads. It also does wonders on tomatoes. This past Thanksgiving, I discovered that it is fantastic for carving turkey. One of the best kitchen items I have purchased in the past several years."
4,"A good bread knife, but...","This knife is light-weight, comfortable to use, and the blade cuts through bread easily without tearing it. The only problem is that it's beveled on one side only, which means that it naturally pulls to one side. I have to be careful to apply the right amount of pressure to keep it slicing straight. A disappointing flaw in what would have been the perfect bread knife!"
5,Don't pass this up,"This is the best sketch comedy ever. The UCB is a group of improv people who got a break on Comedy Central. Their skits are the funniest around. My last review was not published because I named my favorite skits, guess I won't do that now, but that should give you an idea of where the UCB take their sketches. You will laugh over and over as you watch this. Like the title says, do not pass this up."
5,"season 2, where are you?!","This is hands down the most underated sketch comedy show ever created. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. It's not for everyone, but neither was Python."
5,I had the titular line in this DVD!!,The UCB is definitely the best comedy show ever to grace our television sets. It's a shame that Comedy Central chose to pull the show. To give those who are not in the know an idea of how valuable this DVD is; people were paying up to $130 for low quality VHS copies of the show on eBay (myself included). The show is THAT GOOD!You need to buy this DVD set!$25 is too much money you say? Would you consider paying $50 for two?COMDEY CENTRAL PLEASE RELEASE THE NEXT TWO SEASONS THIS YEAR!!!!I need a fix of super cool stat!
3,Joint Review of A Logical Magician and A Calculating Magic,"This is an entertaining and lighthearted pair of fantasy novels. As with other books of this type, the basic premise is that magical and mythical creatures continue to live among us. Weinberg finds witty ways to integrate the magical into ordinary life. The magician Merlin is a financial consultant, wood nymphs inhabit shopping malls, etc. The hero is a young mathematician who uses logic and knowledge of modern society to vanquish the villains. Of these two books, A Calculating Magic is the more amusing with better character development and clever use of Norse and Arabic mythology. The major joke at the end of A Calculating Magic is particularly clever. These books are hard to find but well worth a few dollars in a used book store."
4,Great Nostalgic fun,This is a great collector's item for anyone who is a fan of these groups. The 5th Dimension sound really great and the Association are fun to watch too. The cd that goes along with the DVD is a nice bonus as well.
4,......,"I began to read The Winter People because it is on my school reading list. It is not the type of book I would normally pick up to read for pleasure. However once I got into the book I found it quite interesting. The book takes place before people were civilized like they are now, and is about people who have a completely different way of living. I can actually say I learned about another culture, by reading this book.The story is about an Indian tribe that gets torn apart by white people. But specifically the book tells about a boy names Saxso that, in my opinion, truly becomes a man by the end. He gets separated from his mother and two sisters while escaping, and as the head of the family it is his job to get his family back together. After learning they had been taken by whites, Saxso sets off for a long, difficult journey to rescue them.The Winter People is the type of book that is hard to start, but once you get into it, you'll be glad you kept reading."
3,Not for everyone..,"Read how great it was.. So i tried a blind buy.. Just wasn't for me.. Little to flowery or powdery.. Not in a bad or offensive way.. I'm just a sweet, spicy, or aqua kind of guy..."
5,Great,"This is my favorite cologne of all time. The smell is so unique it's unlike any other. Literally last all day. The top notes come off very strong but after about 30min the smell that stays is incredible. Its lavendery, tobacco, musk. Meant for romantic nights and cold weather."
5,iron fist in a velvet glove,"I bought it along with the body gel about a year ago. The EDT lasts for about 5 hours, the gel for up to 3. It's the most versatile EDT i have ever had, can EVEN wear it to work (which would be a little too ... but still I could), suitable for all ages (I am 25), doesn't stay too close to the body and can stand its ground in the night crowd (unlike XS or Ultraviolet man), so it gets noticed. At the same time it's not too bold or anything so it doesn't irritate people and is really good from up close (unlike Moschino Friends which I love but is a little too ""noticeable""). I guess some people would say it's just OK because there isn't any REAL strong notes to blow you away, but honestly, why would you want that? It's also complex and ... dreamy, guess the name suits it well. The price is also good compared with some other names."
5,Awesome....,"I wasn't so sure of the scent the first time that I put this on. But after a few minutes I loved it. As the other reviewers have said, women LOVE the scent/smell of this. One women told me last night when I was at a bar, that I was the best smelling man there. I will for sure buy this again!"
5,corvair,"After searching bookstores,I realized go to Amazon. Found the exact book I needed.Price was reasonable,condtion was as advertised. Book arrived on time.My husband is very happy."
1,Useless,"It seemed to smell okay for a little bit and then after about a week, no good smell and it did nothing to remove the odors in the bathroom."
4,Pom Poms,"This VHS tape is one in a series of ""I Wish I Were a..."" for young kids(the others include 'Football Player', 'Cowboy', and 'Ballerina'). The tape is about 30 minutes in length and is suitable for kids 5 and under. Fun program for the young ones to enjoy and dream of becoming a cheerleader in the future."
4,Heavy... Truely Heavy,"I always thought that Hatebreed was a weak band that sounded like all the other new heavy metal bands out there. But after I really listened to them I was really amazed by what I heard. This CD really shows what a heavy metal band should be, real. This album is real, there's no gimmicks. Just four guys getting together making some of the must hateful music I've heard in a long time. Tracks that really stand out to me are ""Tear It Down,"" ""Straight To Your Face,"" ""Live For This,"" ""Doomsayer,"" ""Another Day, Another Vendetta,"" ""Beholder Of Justice,"" ""Choose Or Be Chosen,"" and ""Confide In No One."" If you are looking for an album that you can listen to when you are angry, if you are looking for a truely heavy album, if you are looking for good lyrics/vocals, or if you are looking for good music then this album if for you. I reccomend this album to any metal heads out there, this is one band that should definately be on your CD rack."
3,Hatebreed got lazy,"The extremely long wait for their last album was well worth it and now they put out their third album a little over a year later. Yeah, it's good but it's not up to their potential. There are way fewer breakdowns and none of their signature anthems. I was expecting super heavy and this album is a let down. However they still have the inspiring lyrics and old school hardcore style. Worth getting for a hardcore fan, otherwise get their other albums."
2,Rise of this band sucks.,"Hatebreed. I guess they worked it out like this. Ok, we got something good here. Lets keep using it over and over. Why bother to change?You like this kind of music? Listen to Terror."
1,HATEBREED SUCKS,"Thats all I have to basically say. Its sad I HAVE to give this band even 1 star. Bullshi*. This is one of the worst if not the worst band ever. No wonder Jaime tries to host Headbangers Ball, and sadly he cant even do that. They suck and so does anything else they attemp to do"
4,Tea Infuser,"This tea infuser works very well in my little tea pot. It's so clean and easy to use, and the gold screen does not affect the taste. I highly recommend this product to tea enthusiasts!"
5,War Hammer Gold Edition Rocks,"It's a great game unfortunately it won't load on my laptop which runs on vista. Although, it loads and plays fine on my desktop which also runs on vista. Don't know the reason. Other than that it's a great game. Never gets old."
1,poor quality,broke the first day of use. i used it on 3 cars after that the gage was reading at 80 lbs. of pressure no matter what the correct air pressure was
4,High On Fire meets Isis,"If you like High On Fire, then buy this CD. On a couple of the songs Matt Pike tries some cleaner vocals, it's good."
2,That Beautiful Somewhere,"That Beautiful SomewhereI bought this movie becaue of Roy Dupuis being in it. It is a very depressing movie. Although Roy is the only one that brings any kind of quality to the movie. Jane McGreggor trys, but still comes off as an amature when reading her lines, she should probably just stay with those girlie movies she is known for, because she stinks in this one! Sorry to be so harsh but there it is. I liked the music and the scenery,looks a lot like New England or CT. All in all. I would not buy this movie if it wasn't for Roy Dupuis. It just felt depressing and the fact that Conk really had no life of his own, probably due to the ending. I read somewhere that Roy did this movie because it was near his home. I guess he did it for the money?"
5,As always,"Francine rivers does such a good job of educating as well as entertaining. Love her books, especially mark of the lion series"
3,Not like her other books,"I was highly disappointed in this book after reading almost every other book of Ms. Rivers'. It reads like a romance novel and she makes a highly political statement on page 137 that attacks a popular radio host, through one of her characters. It seemed like the insult came out out of the blue, and was totally out of context with the rest of the book. Please do not make this the first book you read of Ms. Rivers'. Start with ""Redeeming Love', ""The Sin Eater"" or one of her series, ""Lineage of Grace'. Her other books are outstanding and I loved reading them."
2,"I like her books, but...","It seems like the author has an axe to grind in this one. I was left with the impression that a church would have to compromise its beliefs in order to grow large, and that ONLY a faithless pastor could be successful when it comes to numbers of people. It also seemed that a major point was that church music had to be old in order to bear the gospel.As a fan of her other work I wanted to benefit from this book, not have to strain to get past what seems to be gratiutous bitterness."
1,This Book Got On My Last Nerve!,"I am a Francine Rivers fan and couldn't wait to read this book.....boy, was I ever disappointed. I wanted to slap some sense into Eunice and tell her to leave that worthless, self-centered husband of hers. How much abuse does God really expect one woman to take? I mean, come on! The Bible even gives permission to divorce in the event of adultry. I find it hard to believe that any woman would have put up with everything that she did. And, no offense, this was a modern-day book and I just couldn't get into a woman in her 30's being named Eunice. Then, the way her husband totally transformed himself so quickly....I don't think so. I did not like this book at all!"
2,The Perfect Preacher's Wife,"I've read a lot of church fiction (especially while reasearching my book,Left Behind in a Megachurch World: How God Works through Ordinary Churches), and I found this one very disappointing. There was too much spiritualizing and too much crying and eyes welling up with tears, and the characters are not nuanced. That's particularly true of Eunice, wife of Paul, mother of Timothy. (Those New Testament names were a bit over the top.) Eunice is just too nice for me. She's not real, and that fact alone caused me to give up on the book before the end---though I did go to the end to find out how Francine would set up the finale. I've worked with people who present a perfect exterior (""My Calvin Seminary Story""), but I know things are often very different behind the scenes. If you want a good church novel, check out Leaving Ruin.Leaving Ruin"
1,Lounge rip,"If you harken back to the days of bad lounge lizard music, this is the disc for you. When I put it on in the living room even the dog took off for other parts of the house. Part of the point of the disc is to offer you music with different rythms so you match the tempo to your personal golf swing. If the listener internalized the music along with the tempo I am afraid the golfer would find it difficult to swing and wretch at the same time. At least now I have a good gag gift for an unsuspecting soul in my usual 4-some. It will be a gift that goes on giving because none of those characters would keep it for themselves."
2,Not her best,"Debbie wins the poor timing award with this release. It was at this time she was judging that kids talent show on TV. Why would you release an album full of show tunes when exposed to a new generation of youngsters? That would have been a great time to release a new album of either original material or covers of pop tunes with kid appeal. As is, it's still just average at best and I'm a big fan. I was really looking forward to it when it originally came out and for the first time felt let down by her."
2,"Delivers little action, generic plot, and monotony.","I watched the trailer for this film and was expecting lot of action. Unfortunatley, there were only two real action scenes. The rest of the film is filled with a rather boring and generic plot--fighting the Italian mob, trying to take back the business, etc. etc. Chow-Yun Fat's character seems confused--at times he's quite tough and at others sentimental and other times simply stupid. Also, the film's first action sequence is wonderful but the second get boring after a while and is dull."
1,OK but barely. NOT WORTH THE MONEY-ONLY ABOUT $1.00,"There are a few funny things in this video, but there's only about 3 that you can really see right because the pictures on this video move so quickly that you are always barely glimpsing what might be going on. Or else it's something that's not even funny. I would say DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR MONEY, because they have the pictures spinning from one setting to the next so fast that you don't even have time to laugh."
3,Funny for a bit,I teach government and hoped this would be a fun counterpoint to the course and text. It was fun for about 10 minutes. The fun quickly gave way to the mundane. It was educational in it own way: Nancy Reagan and Margaret Thatcher are spazzes that should wear sensible shoes or combat boots and stay away from high heels. I guess they did have more in common than their affections for Ronnie.
4,Egyptian myths retold,"Zelazny has a unique storytelling style, one that naturally adds mythic scale to anything it narrates. So when he enters the world of Egyptian mythology, he seems entirely at home. He captures the epic scale of the stories which, after all, were originally meant to encapsulate the ancients' experience of their entire world.Somehow, he pulls this off without faux archaism, even with a bit of modern urbnaity. And, if you look closely, you find it leavened with sprinklings of dry humor. Zelazny's ""Light and Darkness,"" among other works, certainly earns him a place in the front ranks of modern fantasists.-- wiredweird"
2,Southerner in a Strange Land,"This book had a good begining, and at first reminded me a little of Ellison's Invisible Man in reverse (an amnesiac Southern White trying to come to terms with the South). Soon, however, the book becomes entangled in the happenings of a strange southern family, and all coherence stops. Characters say one things, then turn around and say the opposite; they continualy talk about having adventures, but nothing ever comes of it. The pace of the novel begins to feel a lot like a traffic jam: false start, sudden stop, false start, sudden stop. It was much too much like real life in that respect for my liking.I must confess I didn't finish the book. At page 291, lacking the desire to continue and realizing that reading the thing had become a chore, I skipped to the end, which didn't restore my faith any.I know that Walker Percy can write a good story, but in the case of The Last Gentleman it seems that he didn't."
5,A pilgrimage of observation,"Will Barrett, often bemused, confused, and having the uncanny ability to take on the characteristics of others to fit in as needed, seeks the meaning of life through his telescope (his powers of observation as well as a literal telescope), and a journey prompted by a girl he spys on in Central Park. While Will feels lost to himself, struggling with modern morality, the ""new"" South, and his family history, those he meets on his often humorous journey from New York back to the South, and finally, the new frontier of the West, often mistake him as the salvation to ease their own paths. Walker Percy is the master of fusing philosopy, religion, and an examination of the pitfalls in modern life with humor and storytelling."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"This is a pretty good emo-pop band. They're very commercial sounding, but they aren't typical power-pop emo, they have much stronger and more prominent melodies, and intricately layered parts that compliment each other perfectly for the ultimate pop punch. Some of the lyrics are ridiculously juvenile (""Sleeping's overrated, we lay awake and cry, if this is love then kill me now and save me from my life""), but it doesn't bother me too much because musically these guys so have their own style. They aren't held back by the confines of the emo scene sound like every other band, they just write really good pop-rock songs, and actually use overproduction well to add depth to their sound instead of losing it like most bands do. The My Bloody Valentine style guitar on Tearing Through Me is a welcome surprise and further evidence that these guys have a wider range of influences and creativity than their emo peers."
1,DON'T!!!!,"There are many books with the title of Book of Shadows. This one takes the reader through what happens in a traditional Gardnarian coven. Ms. Wippler outlines the basics of First, Second and Third Degree Initiation ceremonies and what they entail in Part One of the book. Part Two contains brief descriptive chapters for many of the items and spell work that are common to witches. She titles this chapter ""Magic of the Witches.""Ms. Wippler writes the book from an observer's prospective. She has never been a Gardnerian coven initiate, claiming to be self-initiated instead, and writes her explanations in third person.I have serious reservation about this book and would hesitate to recommend it to anyone not already familiar with the precepts of Gardnerian Wicca."
4,Classic Dumb Humor,This movie is a farce but very funny in a 1980's kind of way. It exploits all major Canadian stereotypes. The McKenzie brothers are the original dumb and dumber with a norther twist.
4,Very funny,"My, now grown Sons and I watched this movie when we were all a lot younger. Funny as hell, even now."
4,A movie to see with an Molson on your armchair,"Bob (Rick Moranis) and Doug (Dave Thomas) McKenzie are the ultimate in Canadiana, eh ? As their plan of getting free beer by stuffing a mouse in a beer bottle and complaining in high places fails, they get jobs at Elsinor brewery, a sinister place with sinister plans, which are brewed by the brewmeister who is no less than Max Von Sydow !!! Beauty ! He wants to take over THE WORLD ! But Bob and Doug can save the day, eh ?A movie to see with an Molson on your armchair, eh ?"
4,Best Hamlet Ever!,"An outrageous take on the Hamlet story, this film works as a belch level comedy and intellectual art. The occasional dips into stock material from SCTV are more than made up for with the generally good writing and clever parody."
4,Good Day! But not as good as I remember,"I have very fond memories of this movie - it is still entertaining, but not quite the laugh-fest I remember. Maybe I've been jaded by recent gross-out comedies, but pouring beer out of a dirty dog dish doesn't have the effect it once did.That said, this is still a great movie. There is real chemistry between Bob & Doug, and their antics are still amusing - from releasing moths to drinking vats of beer. This is a like-able pair.Looking back, I wish I would have rented this instead of buying it, but I'll happily file it in the ""nostalgia"" section of my DVD collection."
4,Beauty movie Ay,"Take off you Hoser!and get this movie you nob.Bob and Doug just live fortwo things. Beer and Donuts(Jelly Prefered).When theirHomemade movie bombs at theLocal theatre, Bob gives away Dads Beer money.Dadsnot happy so what to do.Gezz the old mouse in a bottle Ay. The local Liquorstore sends the boys and their bottle to the brewery.And they get a beauty of a job Ay, Watching for mice in beer bottles.I just watched it again for the first time in over ten years.Its still Hilarious no matter what age you see it.So sit backget a Brew,Grab some Corn and laugh like a Canadian you Hoser. Oh try not to get whiplash from your burps Ay."
5,"It's Hamlet, eh","I remember laughing hysterically with this movie when I was but a teenager, and when I bought and viewed it recently (some twenty years later) I could still say all the lines! This is a moron movie but not the cheezy slapstick too common in so many of today's alleged comedies; Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas play such rich characters that I would say their performance ranks up there with Laurel and Hardy. It's genuinely funny and it stands the test of time. Plus, it's the story of Shakespeare's _Hamlet_, except instead of taking place in Elsinore castle in Denmark, it takes place in Elsinore brewery in Canada. Plus, the hockey and Star Wars references are lots of fun. OK, there's lots of beer in the film, but its humor comes from its characters, not the beer, you hosers. And, I heard that, like, if you buy this DVD and there's a mouse in the case, that you get free DVDs for life."
5,A Comedic Canadian Gem!,"I have seen this movie many, many times. Each time it is as wonderful as the first! It is a basic story about two guys that love drinking beer and have to stop an evil maniac. This evil maniac just happens to be a brewmaster at a beer brewery. Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis, the McKenzie Brothers in the movie, started off with their comedy sketch on SCTV called ""The Great White North"" in which they used phrases like ""Eh"" and ""Hoser"" all the time. This movie is full of witty comedy and funny phrases like ""If I didn't have puke breath right now, I'd kiss you."" Totally hilarious. Our two heroes find themselves in all kinds of situations involving beer: their favorite thing in the world. They even get trapped inside of a large beer vat and have to drink their way out! Give this movie a try if you like good, in- your-face comedy, with just a splash of goofiness and stupidity!"
2,Tea Strainer,"As long as you don't expect to use this as part of your good silver set, it is fine, for now.The craftsmansihip is pretty weak, but it does work as advertised. By weak, I mean that the spot welds to hold the handle on are poor and rough looking giving it a very cheap look. It hasn't broken yet, but if I flexed the handle, I expect it to break easily.I probably would not buy this again, especially since there are other less expensive ones to choose from."
1,Turned it off after 20 minutes,"This movie is really, really terrible. Well, at least the first 20 minutes are, since I didn't get any further. I was looking to watch something funny and dumb, but unfortunately, this was just dumb. Skip it and re-watch an old favorite instead."
5,Hot Rod is hilarious!,"This movie is hilarious! I took my four kids to see it in the theater and they loved it, non-stop laughing! More humor than Napoleon Dynamite and witty references to the '80's movies I loved in college. Definitely worth buying."
3,not so pleased,"I dont have a problem with the movie itself, it was new and never opened, but I did have an issue with the fact that the seller didn't specify on his site that this must be played on an HD DVD player not a regular DVD player. He only gives this info when I went to look at returning the item because I dont have an HD DVD player. He did offer to take it back but wouldn't refund my shipping fee and wanted to charge me a 20% restock fee. This is not good customer service and I wont purchase from him again."
5,This movie is Number 1,"I was questioning which movie is a truer ""voice of the generation""-- this, or Scott Pilgrim VS the World-- so I did a side-by-side comparison, on two consecutive nights. Honestly I was a little drunker when I watched Hot Rod, but I must say that it simply has more soul."
4,Stupid but funny!,"""Hot Rod"" follows the time-honored tradition of SNL cast members (former and current) putting out silly, hackneyed material that rarely suprises but always cracks you up (at least the good ones do). For me, this movie ranks up there with the best of its stablemates (Billy Madison, Tommy Boy, Dirty Work, Zoolander etc) in that it was poorly received by critics, appeals mostly to young adult males, has a tired plot (hapless idiot takes on seemingly insurmountable odds, stumbles along the way but ends up getting the girl and saving the day), yet is hillarious and very quotable.If you don't think there's anything wrong with a movie that entertains (much) more than it enriches, and enjoy stupid jokes and gag humor like those found in the aforementioned movies, then you'll probably enjoy 'Hot Rod'. Bonus: The soundtrack is awesomely 80's and Will Arnette plays a perfect D-bag."
1,Hot Rod,"We watched this movie and loved it, so I decided to buy my son a copy. The one we purchased from Amazon cannot be viewed on his XBOX, our BluRay Player, our DVD player or even his Computer. Make sure you are smarter than I was and read the HD DVD which is apparently very important because that is the only type of machine it will actually play on. We now have a movie that we cannot watch because we don't have an HD DVD player and it won't play on anything else. BUMMER!!!!"
5,great movie,this film was film in my town morris ill .it was film at the school i went too.it only 65 min long .it a billy gram film .a boyn get in trouble .and they moved hime from chicago .there a homecoming dance in the movie .the dance was in my high school gym ..our school real name for our football team it called morris redskins and the movie name for morris was called the gesries .i recomend it.i do own it on vhs i want to get it on dvd icheck christanbooks store and cant find it iand other school are invold.when the movie starts you will see cow on morris entrance .it a cleanmovie and family rated no bad langue at all.please what it there is a short billy gram crusade
5,The Happy Lion,Remember this from when I was young! It's easy to sympathise with the Happy Lion as well as probably feel some empathy for the townspeople.
2,crime lab case,"I thought that Nancy Drew: Crime Lab Case was pretty good. I read it at night, and i got spooked a few times. Overall, i was quite good."
3,Average,"A little hard to handle because the stem is so small--would have been better with some kind of rod attached. Also, and this sounds a little off, but I think that there are too many feathers. Fewer feathers would have allowed for more control."
4,Very entertaining and educational.,"One of the few novels written about the French and Indian War (I would like to see more written about this time period). This is a book about a French and British officer, an Indian French ally and a Virginia militia man and how there lives intertwine during the French and Indian Wars. This is a great read and I recommend it highly."
5,Great Essay!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this essay comparing the Army of Northern Virginia with the Army of Tennessee. The author discusses the differences in origin, leadership, logistics, geography, officers and men. In a final chapter the author gives a good summary of the debate over Robert E. Lee and the socalled ""western concentration bloc"" that argues that Lee squandered men in fruitless battles in the East while letting the Confederate defense of the West wither. This is a great book to focus one's thoughts -- a well balanced beginning, not an end!"
4,Billy P. says,Great CD if you like sick songs done in a real professional manner. I would highly recommend this collection of madness to anyone.
5,Loved It!!,I really liked the book. I liked it because it was a magic book and also because it involed children. I would also recomend his other books such as half magic and the well wishers.
1,Splatter screen,"This splatter screen did not work at all for me. The first time I used it, apparently it got too hot. it burned around the edges, and I couldn't clean it by scrubbing, or the dishwasher. I sent it back, and received my refund."
3,good quality but somewaht cumbersome,"It's good and big. But somewhat cumbersome to use and store. My pot is smaller, so the edge of the cover some times catch the spreading oil and burn (I have a gas stove) which produce smoke.I would rather use a regular cover or have a smaller splatter screen cover."
3,Mostly does what it should,"These are real handy for cutting down on the splatter from frying. Makes it easier to clean the stove, not to mention the floor, lights, range hood and everything else that gets splattered by fry grease. I will not have one unless I have a dishwasher because they are a real bear to get nicely clean."
3,Stained a little,"This splatter screen is great. Fits over a variety of pans and really does prevent splatter. My only complaint is that it somehow got stained. Not sure if it's burnt on grease or what, but it won't come off. Doesn't really matter, I still use it. After all, it's just to stop splatter!"
1,Poor quality,Arrived well-packed but one of the welds attaching the handle to the screen was broken. Returned and will be looking for something a bit more sturdy.
5,Works Great!,I purchased this splatter screen from amazon and I am pleased with it so far! It works great and fits on most skillets because it is big. Its only drawback might be that it is too big for some skillets (but I am sure you can buy a smaller size for smaller skillets). I have also been pleased that it cleans up easy in the dishwasher without rusting (although it can be difficult to fit in my dishwasher)! Great product!
4,This is a very useful guide to castles in Scotland,"This is very useful as a general introduction to the castles in Scotland. It looks at over 200 sites, giving information about the history of the castle plus opening times . It gives a little information , obviously limited by space , about a lot of castles rather than a lot of info about any one castle. It certainly isn't a detailed guide to any single castle. It is well illustrated with many pictures of the castles. If you like castles , you will love this book."
4,low cost solution,"Different concept than other cable locks, but works ok and proved to be a low cost solution."
3,Lanky Cat-Ziggy-Black,"I have many black cats and wanted a plush one. This cat was a little smaller than I expected and his eyes and ears aren't exactly symmetrical. The way the face looks on a plush animal is important to me, so I think a person is taking a risk buying online. Every face seems to be just a tad bit different on each animal. I keep wanting to adjust his eye brows and ears a little to make his expression a little more appealing. Overall, he's a cute but small plush."
5,Purrrrfect- I'm so corny =),I bought this for a dear friend that was in a bad accident- I was looking for a black cat since he had one and obviously needs a stand in furry friend while he recovers- his cats name was Ziggy- so this was too perfect- he loves it =)
2,Comfortable - while they're in one piece.,"These headphones were great while they lasted. They are indeed very comfortable, however after about a month of daily use, the y-shaped piece of plastic that holds the can to the headstrap broke. I repaired it, and only two days later the other side broke. I've read a lot since that these pieces break all the time.Secondly, the open/closed switches that supposedly block out ambient noise, or let the noise in, do not do anything. I can not notice any change what so ever.Pros:ComfortableDecent sound qualityCons:Poor build qualityCord is too shortAmbient noise suppression does nothingOverall:Keep looking, these cans are a waste of money. Unless you wear them once a month for an hour or two, they will break on you. The sound quality is sub-par, and you're paying money for features that just plain don't work. This is my third set of Sony headphones that have broken and I am no longer a faithful customer. It is Sennheiser for me from now on."
3,Clear sound sub par bass (lows),"I have had this product for only a few hours. I purchased the Sony MDR-NC6 headphones between 1.5 to 2 years ago and the sound that I received was above par. It was mostly noticable on the low side. However, these headphones seem to be better suited for classical music lovers. If you are looking to experience the full spectrum or a full range of sound, these headphones are not for you.Pros:Good mid and high level soundsNice tight fitWorks great as earmuffsReally keeps out unwanted soundsCons:Open close switches do not seem to make a noticeable difference as far as I can tellLow (bass) sounds are not the bestOverall:Good earmuffs with speakers but at a high price.Not worth the price."
2,"Great sound quality, but they will break","It's sad. I love this style of headphone from Sony. I've had numerous models from them, starting with some of their classic egg styles in the past. The problem is that those, like these, suffer from subpar build quality. I bought two of these. Each one broke in the exact same way: the plastic pieces that hold the headphones in place broke. They both broke after 2-3 months of ownership. When they do break you see how poorly constructed they are. The plastic is very weak.Also, these are just headphones I wear at the office, while working at my desk. I'm not stuffing them into some overstuffed bag or throwing them around the house."
3,Flawed Track Inclusion,"I have to admit right off the bat that I don't own this album, although I've been trying to scrape up all the original soundtracks for the movies and some of the TV series. But looking through the track listing, it seems muddled with too many sound effects and tracks that could've been replaced with better ones. I wish Paramount and the recording industries would release a 2-CD set of tracks that includes only the main title sequences of each Star Trek TV series and standout tracks from the 10 feature films, since most of these soundtracks have gone out of print and are hard to find. Most of these compilations of different film tracks never include the main title sequences of the films, which are often the standout orchestral tracks of each movie. I hope they release an album like this, filled with only the best Trek music that is hard to find."
2,Why waste your time with re-recordings???,"Buy the originals. That is what makes them famous. Its just that, its no fun to hear someone else's version of classic music. There is spark and emotion to the music that is Star Trek, and when someone does a copy....its not the same."
1,only ignorant or deceptive people call Marx a racist,"Marx opposed slavery and believed in equality. He wrote, ""In the United States of North America every independent movement of the workers was paralyzed so long as slavery disfigured a part of the republic. Labour cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black it is branded."" To call him a racist, you have to take his words out of context and ignore the ways our language has changed since Marx's time."
3,"Cute, but not all that","Bought this for my first-grader. She loves it, but I am not quite as impressed. The bag is not as sturdy as I would have liked. The insulation is thin and barely there; I doubt it keeps the lunch either cold or hot. Bag is also smaller than anticipated. It is okay for a 6 year old, but I see a new bag in my future as her lunches continue to grow apace with her hunger."
5,Excellant Story,I found this book to be a wonderful read and i hated to finish it. i can't wait to start on the other two books in the series.. though i wish it wasn't just a trilogy.
1,Terrible Book,"After reading ""The Puzzle Palace"", this book was a huge disappointment. I bought it because I was looking for an update to the information contained in The Puzzle Palace, which was published in 1982. Instead of getting a factual presentation, the author only seems capable of supplying his unsupported (and wild) opinions, all based on conspiracy theories. I felt as though I was being given a sales job. I read, with amusement, the reviews in which some readers thought the book was good merely because the author was a Christian. What a useless reason to like a book! (the author is balding, so maybe balding men will like it too). Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Needs Updating Badly,The Access series tends to be a great series of guide books and the Las Vegas book is well done for 2000 but it is 2007 and the amount of changes in Las Vegas has me begging for a complete overhaul and update to this book ASAP!
2,WHAT FUSION???,"i BOUGHT THIS DVD LOOKING FOR A PILATES WORKOUT, I OWN THE NEW YORK CITY BALLET WORKOUT 1 &2, ALSO THE BALLET BOOT CAMP 2 DVD, I'VE BEEN ALTERNATING THESE DVDS FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS. THE PILATES FUSION LACKS OF CARDIO WORKOUT AND THE WARM UP SECTION, THE EXCERSISES ARE PRETTY EASY TO FOLLOW, THE AB SECTION IS THE ONLY GOOD PART IN THIS DVD.IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BALLET FUSION FORGET IT, IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY TECHNIQUE OF CLASSICAL BALLET AND THE POSITIONS AND STEPS AREN'T WELL PERFORMED.I WOULN'T RECOMMEND THIS DVD OVERALL, THERE ARE BETTER CHOICES FOR HOME WORKOUTS."
5,one of a kind,"I find Jennifer to be one of the best Pilates instructors on DVD. I've followed her since the Method and I basically love her instructional style and her soothing voice. Her information is much appreciated and her outlook towards Eastern philosophy is inspiring. What a value, 4 of her DVDs chock full of information and a real physical and mental treat. Do your body good!!!"
1,Not good for music. Average as a headset,These headphones are advertised for listening to music. I don't recommend them for that. The sound quality is the same as the cheap headphones you get on an airplane.The transmit distance is less than five feet. More than that and they lose the signal. They work ok as a cell phone headset but are not worth the price.
5,alaska la mejor,"sin duda alguna puedes comprar este disco, sin pensar en devolverlo, alaska ya es un mito y sin duda es ya la onceaba musade la musica hispana, ella es mistica,su voz exuberante,sensilla y sobre todo con los pies en la tierra, en nuestra bruja de oro y la hechisera del rock, que hechiza con su musica. sin duda tambien tiene en este disco esa cancion de Eternamente inocentey Hombres."
5,Very Good Quality,"Got these for our new Frigidaire stove which had a black cooktop and chrome drip pans in our remodeled kitchen. I realize the chrome is more efficient, but it just didn't look good. These pans are at least as good quality as the originals, and in our case, look much better."
4,Drip Pan make over,"My Fridgedaire oven/range drip pans were in bad shape with stains and rust was setting in. It was time for four new drip pans and I needed a more serviceable color and material. The porcelain will make clean ups easier and the black color will not show stains like the silver color standard drip pans.The drip pans were delivered promptly, but when I opened the package, the drip pans were tightly together one on top of the other. I had to carefully pull them apart without bending or damaging the finish. Perhaps a sheet of paper between each drip pan would prevent this or perhaps it was my package that got compressed during shipping?Anyway, the four drip pans are a perfect fit and they give my range an affordable and easy make over."
3,Finally,"After three written attempts and one phone call I finally received a copy of the purchased warranty, though I am still waiting for the promised e-mail version. Having read through it, it is a standard document. Hopefully, the service portion will prove better than the sales fulfillment division."
1,Crappy CD player,"I purchased this cd player for my car when the stock one stopped working. All I wanted was a simple cd player that plays the radio and cds as well as the stock one that came in the car. This player skips all over the place- on brand new discs with no scratches. The way it's wired it is hot all the time, and it locks up and feels hot enough to burn skin. I ended up re-wiring it so it would not have power when the car was off, and it that took care of it locking up and freezing, but it still skips all over and the sound quality is crappy. I would not recommended this player to anyone. I am replacing this piece of junk with one from a company that makes good products."
1,Are they kidding?,"Is this really what television has come to? This was terrible... tacky, offensive, poor acting...terrible. I don't understand where the writers are even coming from. Don't waste your time with this one."
4,Very informative,"From the history of specific indigenous tribes, to current issues and religious traditions every chapter in this book provides a lot of information and stresses the differences and similarities between various groups. This was a required book for one of my college classes and it has helped me gain an appreciation for North American Indians in termes of their struggles for federal recognition and their assimilation into mainstream society while maintaing their interesting traditions and practices. This is a must read for anyone interested in cultural anthropology and/or Native Studies."
4,"Good intro to yoga, bad for anyone with a wrist, shoulder, or elbow injury.","Watch the video first, don't even try to do the poses. Then try to follow along, and be prepared to either rewind or skip.And if you have any arm or shoulder injuries, be aware that many yoga poses require you to put weight on sensitive joints. Make sure you talk to a doctor if you have any of these issues and stop if it hurts."
4,a great way to get into yoga,"We like this video because it doesn't require a lot of time, it's not too groovy or the instructors are not wierd that they're distracting."
1,ultimate commercial yoga,This is the first yoga DVD I bought as a beginning student and it has a commercial interrupting the routine every five minutes or so. Avoid the earth quake caused by as the spinning yogas in thier graves and avoid buying this and all similar Yoga Zone DVDs at all costs.
5,Enteraining and full of great information,I've read several Love and Logic books and this is my favorite. I laughed out loud while reading this book and learned so much!
5,It is a true parenting textbook!,"If I could, I would have given this book six stars. If there isn't a textbook on parenting, this should be it. Read it, you won't regret it!"
5,Nothing beats this for hydroponics,"I am using this as a medium in my hydroponic garden and it is working great. The roots of my plants are finding plenty of surface to latch on to and have been growing beautifully thanks, in part, to this."
1,Ouch!,"Purchased this item because it was the highest rated Microlight. A microlight doesn't do you much good if it keeps turning itself on in your pocket. Very disappointed in this item. It constantly turned itself on and ran down the battery, even when kept in an external (loose) coat pocket. If it doesn't have battery power when you need it, it's pretty much useless."
1,Bulletin Board Strip,This item is a complete waste of money. FELL RIGHT OFF THE WALLafter hanging a few small pieces of paper on it. sticky adhesive isof very poor quality. would love to send it back and NOT pay shipping.
2,"Works great, but very flimsy","I use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the GPS-360 device further down the dashboard. This adapter apparently can't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle. I've only used it twice - first time, it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half. The connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable, but I'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again. I don't want the connector to snap off next."
4,Brilliant blues,This is as good a blues CD in this genre as you can buy. Mike Henderson writes great songs. They would be classics on anyone elses CD. There is not one bad track on this CD. The sound is'GRUNGE BLUES'. A slightly dirty sound like the STONES suits perfectly as a vehicle for MIKE's superb guitar playing ( he plays great slide as well ) throughout the CD. The vocals areexcellent as well and the lyrics are better than most other offerings in this genre. All 3 MIKE HENDERSON CD's are worth buying and are sure to get your next party hopping.
5,WOW THESE GUYS ARE BRILLIANT,As long as musos like Mike Henderson @ the Bluebloods take up the Blues the future is assured. Whenever you think that you've heard it all ( I did ) along comes something like this.Rocking Blues at it's best. A somewhat dirty sound accentuates the care free style in which these virtuosos deliver their highly original and incredibly powerfull take on the Blues. Mike Hendersons guitar playing is powerfull but can be ever so emotive when called for. Great songs that would be standouts on almost anyone elses CD. This will certainly get the party started. I wish they would come to Australia as I am dying to see them live.
5,Nasty!,"The back-alley production values of this disk accentuate the dirty, gritty, irresistibly low-down, gut-bucket blues gushing out of this recording like water from a fire hose. This isn't just an homage to tradition, however; the band takes a lot of chances here, stretching the blues idiom to the breaking point and putting a unique stamp on it. Mike's vocals have never been better, and he's finally been persuaded to get that harmonica out of the trunk (I've never heard better). Meanwhile his bass-strung guitar keeps growling out some of the meanest sounds around. Mike is secure enough to keep coming up with keyboard virtuosi who threaten to walk away with the show, but then again, I bet there's a truckload of top Nashville musicians who'd jump at the chance to play with the Bluebloods. I'll echo the plea of my Aussie mate here: Mike, please get this band to St. Louis ASAP!"
3,Not for me,"This movie is very short and basically involves a very pretty girl getting raped over and over. In typical Japanese Hentai fashion, she is crying and orgasming at the same time. Doesn't really do it for me."
2,What about other women in North America? How do you define success?,"I am looking at this book due to a recommendation in ""mean girls grown up"" by Dellasega. I am disappointed as it seems to marginalize women who really sacrifice to prioritize their family or other non-fame, non-money related fields. Is the home educator who works part time and mentors her own great kids, and neighbourhood not in need of a mentor? Is she less intelligent because she makes less money or because she's less famous? I would like to see feminist writing that is more inclusive of real women's experiences and more varied need for mentoring."
5,Excellent workout video,"This is an excellent workout video. Victoria is at her best. I like her style. She gives very detailed instructions. This is a very good video for anyone who is serious about their workout, but like to have fun doing it."
5,Top-Notch Lem Criticism,"This book has a brief, one-chapter biography, and the rest is top-notch literary criticism on Lem's work up to 1985. This is solid stuff science fiction fans, get a copy now!"
2,"Contents - Great, Print Quality - Really Bad","It is really a shame to have such a classic text with a typesetting that makes much of the mathematics almost unreadable. For example, the authors often use either a tilde, hat (carat), and dot (period) on top of operators, sometimes in combination. These are so badly rendered that you have to derive their identities from the context of the surrounding discussion. Frequently parts of characters are missing as if an old typewriter with a worn ribbon were used. I have 2 other volumes in this series (Mechanics and Statistical Physics Part 1) which do not suffer these defects. My 2-star rating is in no way a reflection of the contents nor the authors, which get 5 stars (based on the prose and the equations I CAN read)."
2,unconvincing,"I have to admit that I am biased against ""themed"" serial killers -- although I am not a psychologist it seems unlikely to me that real serial killers do things like pose the victims to match paintings. I might have tolerated that more if I had found other aspects of the book engaging; however, to me the plot and characterization seemed wooden. The heroine, Kate, was not believable. Let's see, she started as a cop, then not only got a Ph.D. in art history, but made a fortune on a bestselling nonfiction art book? and then more money by starring in a PBS special? Sorry, I don't believe it. I also don't believe that if a woman of that background existed, she would become the admired, accepted-by-all socialite that Kate is supposed to be. Finally, even though I normally love art-themed mysteries, the art connection here was mostly just a way of making the serial killer ""different"". I hope subsequent books are more interesting."
4,Very Helpful,"John Lantz and Dave Gaylor have written a very helpful and honest guide to navigating through the ups and downs of college. The key here is their understanding, down to earth (and at times even funny) tone. It's always easy to exclude yourself when reading these types of books; however, the tone is very inclusive. The authors understand that students aren't monks and nuns and want to get out and truly experience college. The authors try to show students that they need to maintain a healthy balance if they want their degrees.It's clear that the authors set out to make a quick read, and at times, I wish they would have gone into a bit more depth on some subjects, but they usually include resources where more information could be found. All in all, a helpful guide for students and parents."
2,Very poorly written,"There is some good information to be found in this book. However, the layout is very poor with information scattered across multiple chapters. Considerable time is spent going over the basics of DHTML, CSS, and JavaScript - which is a waste of time for a book of this price. As the majority of the book is focused on BSP development, I was disappointed that the coverage was not nearly as clear as one might find in the O'Reilly series on ASP.NET and J2EE. It's not a complete waste, but most of the material can be found on help.sap.com."
3,"Not bad, not great","I found this book a little heavy on over-generalization and ill-chosen illustrations. If Meyers Briggs is a viable system for understanding personality, I didn't get it from this book. Someone told me that ""Please Understand Me"" is a better intro title."
4,Now if only schools used this stuff...,"The descriptions of the types are great. This is very well written and most informative. I recommend it most definitely and wish the inefficient, one-size-fits-all obsolete psych of the education system could get thrown out in favor of this more practical psych system.The only place the Otto and Janet missed the boat completely is where they try and guess famous people's types: they are nearly always off base, strangely."
2,Far from gentle,I just attempted to do the first session of this video and it just goes too fast!!!! The stretches are too hard for someone that just may be starting out and it goes way too fast. There's no time to catch your breath and you start to hurt which if this is gentle yoga I would't think you would. I am quite dissappointed. This is defintley not gentle.
1,NOT a good DVD to begin yoga with...,"I thought this was a very poorly produced DVD for several reasons. It's quite obvious from the get-go that the 2 rushed sessions on this DVD are just a rehash of what's on the TV program of the same name (which I have not seen). I've studied yoga for many, many years and bought this DVD as a way of getting back to doing postures on a regular basis after a (too) long hiatus. I had some excellent teachers years ago and this made it even more blatant, how poorly executed this DVD is.Save your money and keep looking! I wish they would take returns on DVDs too, I'd love to get my $$$ back for this one. It's headed for the ""free"" box at the library.You can read my complete review of this DVD at: myreallifereviews dot com"
2,HUMONGOUSLY BIG FOR THE SIZE,"Overall the construction and design are good, but way to big on its size, they run too big, my daughter looked like a clown with these on.I tried to return them, and I was being charged US$17.00 dollars to send them back, its costing me half more what I paid, this is a real bummer, now I have to eat them up with ketchup, cause I was not going to pay more money to return this!!!!!!I'm too dissapointed!!!!"
2,Very greasy!,"I am not sure what other people are used to when it comes to tom yum soup but I've never had oil floating on top of my soup. this stuff is very greasy and the taste is edible but definitely not what I'm used to. maybe I'm spoiled because of the restaurant I eat it at but I was not happy with this purchase. I'd rather try to make it myself, which I've done before with some success, than use this paste again."
4,Human Resource Management,"As a graduate MBA student using this text in the Fall, 2002 semester, I enjoyed the subject matter covered in the textbook. It opened new points of interest related to Human Resource Management that I have not learned in other business classes."
5,perfect,maybe once or twice it runs slow.. but then it fixes itself.wonderfull release with sounds i have never experienced before.
3,Okay,So it doesn't so what I thought it would which is capture music files from my PC and I would be able to download them to my phone. It didn't work out for me at all. I really didn't know what I was getting myself into. If I did I certainly would not have purchased this thing
4,"No Brainer, work easy","Pro: Good buy. Works fine just like you thought it would.Con: Only one, very minor, the disc holder is not spring loaded."
1,poor design- broke 1st day.,"I liked that it read so many different formats. the main thing I needed was SD and MMC. It doesn't click and eject like other sd card readers, it just sort of slides in. there's no indication of which direction to insert the SD card, it only fits one way but it was hard to figure out which way that was. I used it successfully ONCE and now it comes up ""Device attached has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it."""
2,Works with some but not all SD cards,Works with a 32MB card that came with a Canon Powershot camera but not with a 4GB Kingston SDHC that I use mostly. Disappointing!
2,Doesn't read miniSD.,"I bought two of these just for the mini SD reader function. Neither of these will read a mini SD. It is disappointing to have a bad Sandisk product because they are usually very reliable. These were made for Cingular - so what does that tell you about the age? I believe that this is just a sell-off of (possibly bad) leftover products from a defunct company. It does read micro SD and SD. Since it was only $5, it's not worth the cost of returning."
3,Good but not great!,"I've actually owned this item for about 2 or 3 years now. I'm actually writing this review because this item will not work with any memory card over 2gb! Like I said I've owned this item for a while now and I've never had any problems with it, but now that I own higher capacity memory cards, namely 4gb and higher, it won't detect the card at all. I attribute this to the older technology in the reader. I mean I'm no expert, but I am very computer literate, and I know that there is no reason for the card reader to not detect the card unless there is a problem with the reader. So if you plan on using this card with anything over 2gb, I say do it at your own risk!"
1,Didn't work!,"The computer sees the unit, but the unit doesn't see the Mini SD card, so the computer asks me to ""please insert disk"". Tried putting in the Mini SD every way possible, but it doesn't work!"
3,"OK product for hanging wide items, could have a deeper channel and cork area","I used this product to hang a wide calendar in my office that had just been repainted. I purchased this cork bulletin bar to avoid messing up the paint on my walls by pushing pins directly in the sheet rock.Overall, I would consider this product OK. The push pins only go into the cork about 2/3 of the way before hitting the aluminum backing. It doesn't allow you to secure papers to the bar as nicely as it could if the pin bases rested firmly against the cork surface.I think I would consider other options if I was to look for something similar next time, but it is serviceable as it currently is."
3,crap product but has some use,"I originally intended this to be a daily note display bar, but it has failed me greatly. Now it is a simple pin-a-note bar with very little function.First, the cork is so shallow that pins don't stay in. They fall out frequently and it was dangerous.The construction is not bad, but still can't you put in some better quality cork? these suck!!"
3,Nice to have a copy of the old show still as silly as ever,Action Man is the European version of GIJOE like Joe this comic was made bay DIC so it is very silly. I was bummed that the Live action segments were not included but overall I was happy to get a nice copy of it
3,Be careful Americans,"This is a beautiful, compact, perfectly sized Bible. The only problem is that it's the Anglicized version. This means that the NRSV text has been adapted to reflect British usage of the English language. I haven't explored it enough to find the differences, but don't expect it to match up perfectly with the NRSV in the pews or the pulpit of most protestant churches in the US."
3,This Is Not the Edition Described.,"I received the Oxford New Revised Standard Version POCKET EDITION Bible. It is 4 1/2"" X 6 1/8"" in 6 pt. type. It is a very lovely little bible, but it requires keen eyesight."
3,pretty good but has its flaws,"the book is ok, nicely written, but low-budget and the author seems to think that this technique is the one, ""secret punch"" that will end any fight. he says that with minimal practice you will be able to kill a man witha single blow. i think not."
5,Wonderful,"Out of the entire CD my favorite song was ""I Knew I Loved You""! This was a beautiful song to me and I am approaching 40 this year so I believe that even this song will touch all ages. I identified with some of the words like ""I knew I loved you before I met you"" with the birth of my three sons, because that is how I felt then and still feel now. Great CD! Keep 'em coming!"
3,"First Cut on ""Affirmation"" good, but not great.","When I heard this song I realized where this band was going.....Ballad central. Since their No. 1 smash ""Truly Madly Deeply"", I am sure their label is directing them into Ballad Heaven, and it sure is true- all sugar coated, fluffy love delivered right at your door. ""I Knew I Loved You"" is a good ballad, and pretty, but the band showed originality with pop confections like ""I Want You"", ""To the Moon & Back"" and ""Tears of Pearls"".Bring back the Savage Garden that was supposed to be....United States they ruin everything. The music on pop radio today is so average, no originality....Till this day I do not know how Cher got to No.1 with the fantastic ""Believe"", but then again Mariah Carey went to No. 1 with ""Heartbreaker"" which is a ripoff of her own song ""Fantasy"" which is a total ripoff of ""Genius of Love"" by the Tom Tom Club....So there you have it, a good average schmaltzy love song, to go with the other 6,456 love songs released this year."
3,december,"I have the moody blues as the # 1 rock group since days of future past,I have seen them in concerts 3 times since I came to Canada and I'll love to watch them every time I can,I have spend thousands of dollars in their long plays,cassetes,cds and dvds, I always thought of them as one of the few people in this world who have seen and sang about the things are happenning in this human world,with all the violence,pollution,destruction of this planet and us, and at the same time with all the wonderful and magic things this life has to offer to those that have been able to discover and live them.What I find strange with this new album ""december"" is like if they couldn't find another kind of time and theme to sing their songs,times changes so we are,I hope they can keep that line in their lyrics and music,with their messages of love,peace,joy,that this world needs so much."
4,Will warm your room and heart..................,"This CD will become a nice addition to your holiday music.....Justin Hayward captures the warmth of the holiday season...a fire, some friends and drink....sit back and just enjoy....the sad part....the album is without Ray Thomas...his voice would have added much.....happy holidays to all and peace on earth....."
2,"Fun read, but not very informative","I purchased this book so I could learn more about hunting whitetails. What I got was stories about Mr. Drury's hunts, without much in the way of usable information. Mr. Drury seems to have copious amounts of time for scoping out territory. He also has the land, and financial ability to plant crops specifically for attracting deer. He talks about wind conditions being perfect, without describing what that means. I could go on and on.If you are looking for a book full of well photographed dead deer, this is the book for you. If you are a neophyte to deer hunting and are looking for some tips, this book won't help."
3,NOT what I expected,"I bought this album because I love Azure Ray, and when I heard that those two talented ladies were involved I bought this instantly. I was sorely disappointed.I expected to hear thier beautiful voices here, not the average male vocals that NIO's frontman has. I mean, when you have Maria Taylor & Orenda Fink in your band and put them on backing guitar with no singing responsibilities it's like hiring Eddie Van Halen to play the triangle. What a waste of talent.That said, it's not a bad album, but it could have been so, so much better. I won't buy thier new album until I hear whether or not the ladies of Azure Ray are singing on it. Bottom line: If you want more mediocre indy rock, buy this. There's really nothing special about it though."
3,Kaufman dislikes stop loss?,Kaufman is one of my favorite author. But in this book he seems to have an idea that stop loss is not a good thing! I really cannot agree with him. Except this point the book is quite good. But the other book by the same author contains similar contents. I would perfer the later.
3,I got this as a gift for someone,I got this as a gift for someone I used to know who wanted them; he seemed to like them but I haven't talked to him in a long time.
4,Indispensable source on post-conflict Rwanda,"The world watched in horror as Rwanda descended into hellish barbarism. And after the violence ended, what then? That is Gribbin's subject, written from the perspective of the U.S. ambassador -- the embodiment of U.S. policy in the post-conflict period. His book is filled with exotic names and places, probably more than the non-expert can keep up with. (And the skimpy index is not much help.) Nevertheless, this pioneering book provides a depth of detail and an appreciation for the complexities of nation building under mind-bogglingly challenging conditions. It will be an indispensable resource for the student of the Rwandan tragedy or, more broadly, as a case study on the death -- and, we hope, rebirth -- of a modern nation-state."
3,"Interesting for Anatomists, maybe best for Veterinary Anat.",Interesting pictures of unusual animal postural attitudes that may be useful for certain anatomical descriptions. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A DRAWING MANUAL: IT IS A BOOK OF EXTERNAL AND MUSCULOSKELETAL COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.
5,Great Race Set,My husband and I bought this toy for our 4yr. old son for Christmas. He loves it. The duralock track system is great. It stays locked in place. It is very durable and the cars are really fast. This was his favorite gift. He and his sister play with it all of the time. I would definitely recommend this race set.
1,Poor Construction,"Having had slot car tracks as a child it was my intent to introduce my 7 year old son to the joys as well. Unfortunately the track in question lasted a day.Directions were easy to follow and the track set up with a minimum of difficulty. Upon use, the car on the outside track would only go on half the track before stopping. Figuring that the connection was unstable I disassembled that portion and was able to fix it...temporarily. After 10 more minutes that portion of the track stopped working as well as one of the cars. Disassembling the track again the tabs broke off the track. It seems that plastic isn't as durable as it once used to be. Super glued the tabs back on and the track did not return to operability. Neither did the car no matter how much tuning and cleaning was done to it.Needless to say, I was not very impressed with this product and would not recommend it to any other customer."
2,Don't judge by the cover,"The pictures inside kinda suck, some is okay. It is not worth explaining in detail. It's too basic and mostly outdated. Colored pencil has come a long way since this book. There are many more techniques to better achieve the likeness you are trying to achieve. There are better books sold by better artists too.It's just unnecessary. Some books are good for life, this is not one of them."
2,Interesting costume; turned my wife's skin black!,"For some reason the dye in this costume turned my wife's skin black after wearing it to a costume party for several hours. Most of it washed off, however, some of the darker stains stayed in place for several days!"
3,"Good general mystery, but...","...if you are reading the series for the ""dog"" aspect, which I am since the author is one of the few writing mysteries which include dogs who actually KNOWS dogs, you should be aware that Dashiell is pretty much just an ""accessory after the fact"" in this one. I'd probably give it another star otherwise because as a mystery it's pretty good, but I read a lot of mysteries and from this series I look for a working partnership between Rachel and Dash in addition to the ""mystery""."
4,Great technology - plays memory cards and thumb drives,"I couldn't find ANYTHING remotely like this -- something that could play stored music off memory cards and USB thumb drives. Yes, lots of stereos let you play MP3 players through them, but you are running the MP3 player off battery power, and have to change the battery every 15-20 hours. With this, you just plug in a memory card or thumb drive with music files, and it plays off them -- no batteries needed.The only reason it's not a 5-star is because I wish it had even more wattage for even bigger sound (but it does sound very good -- I just like my stereos BIG)."
3,wrong item,"I ordered the wrong item in error. Needed the battery charger, not the ac adapter. Had to pay for return shipping - amazon deducted the return shipping from the credit. My bad!"
1,I have not used it yet,"I have not used it yet. But comming from Amazon,I know it willbe fine or Amazon will replace it."
2,I don't love it,"I bought this CD partly because of the reviews. I'm always looking for music to play when I teach yoga. This however, is not good for that. I rally don't like it and I think it is too distracting during class."
1,Battery had a crack,"Battery 'looked' great. I purchased some battery acid and filled up one cyclinder to see how much it would take. The next morning I was shocked when I found that it had leaked, and ruined, the carpet in my church office. Absolutely no more purchases from this company."
1,Batteries only last 3 years,"I have had my system for 6 years and now need a third battery. These are the big long-lasting watchdog battery. I will be using a marine battery now.If you don't have a sump back-up system yet - it will cost over $500 - I would consider either installing a water-powered back-up system (runs on tap water), or put the $500 towards a automatic generator system. Also consider putting a second primary sump pump set at a higher level for backing up a failure of the first pump.Don't get into the trap of paying $150 every three years. The battery probably goes bad before it is detected - which risks a flooded basement without a bad-battery warning - as others have found."
1,Stay away from this battery,Does not work as indicated. On many occasions it will not automatically turn on and it will start pumping water after you reset it. It is really a piece of junk.
5,Overcome Fear,This book is an easy to read book with many practical helps and insights. I am planning to teach it in a small group setting in my church.
5,The best book ever on evangelism!,"I have taught this class twice at my church and it is single-handedly the easiest evangelistic tool I've ever experienced. I first studied this book in seminary and is by far the best approach to sharing Jesus, literally without fear.Every person who calls him or herself a Christian needs to own this book. Every church who is obedient to the call of evangelism needs to provide this training to its members."
5,Absolutely wonderful book - buy a couple to give as gifts to friends!,"Two kinds of people reading this book - those who talk about the lost and those who talk to the lost! What a great book. Fay does a great job encouraging people to share their faith in Jesus Christ and takes away all the defenses and excuses that we so often use to remain silent when we should be speaking the Truth to those around us. A couple of things really jumped out at me in this book. The first was that it takes the average person 7.6 times to hear the gospel before responding - which means that you should expect someone to response positively every time you share your faith - but you should stay faithful and continue to plant the seeds in their lives. Also, Fay reminds us that we aren't responsible to convert people - that's the work of the Holy Spirit - our job is just to faithfully share the truth of Scripture with others. Very practical book, excellent gift for every believer you know!"
5,Blessed Book,"William Fay has hit the nail on the head with this one. Share Jesus Without Fear is in my opinion the most effective, easy to use, witnessing program ever written. We as Christians are all called to take part in the Great Commission, but many fail due to fears of acceptance, rejection, not knowing enough...etc. Mr Fay teaches us a simple no nonsense approach to be the witnesses we are commanded to be. Thanks Mr. Fay!!"
5,This is Not Ventriliquism for Dummies,Winch is a terrific book on a couple of different levels. It is chock full of great show business stories. It is also a great psychological tale of how Paul was so afraid of his disapproving mother and how he overcame other obstacles to become a very learned and entertaining man that he is today.Mr Winchell is brutally honest in his autobiography and as a result doesn't always come across as a great guy. His battles with his mother and his wifemake for some great reading. There is a simply beautiful anecdote about how he meets his idol Edgar Bergen. The last few pages of the book concern a spiritual reckoning for Paul that seems a bit out of place but it does bring closure for him. I really felt he ended the book too abruptly. I would have liked to have been brought up to current time. Maybe he has another book in the works. I applaud Mr Winchell for his efforts in telling his story. It is a valuable story to read about.
3,An Unsettling Autobiography,"I grew up watching Winchell-Mahoney Time...I REALLY wanted to like this book... In most bios, it's the little secrets you learn that keep you reading and make you feel more intimately involved with the subject. But in this book, I felt like ""averting my eyes"" to preserve the dignity of a human who shouldn't have had to go there.The book was so embarrassingly tell-all, that I don't believe an enemy of Mr. Winchell's could have hurt him more.I profoundly admire Mr. Winchell's brilliant talent and contributions to children's television, ventriloquism, and well, the world, but this book was so dark that I needed to remove it from my house.I wish a second book could come out that chronicles Mr. Winchell's life, but omits the morbid minutia about the mother and ex-wives. Nobody needs to read that.I still feel for him though, and all the participants in his life. Good luck to everyone concerned."
4,Good introduction to the works of Dan Simmons,I had owned this book in the past and wanted to get it again. The stories range from just good to fantastic. I've read many of the books Dan Simmons wrote and like most of his work. Some of these stories were turned into larger books later on. I know a lot of writers that are worse than Simmons but can think of few better.
3,Choclate Disks,Chocolate was good...but pretty expensive for a little bag....there is just as good chocolate out there that is cheaper.
4,Great basic document performance,"I bought one for my office and found it easy to install, great choice of one-sided or two-sided scans and the copy function works great too. About one of 100 pages may feed double due to an old staple mark etc., but I use it all day, every day for basic document scanning of 8 1/2 x 11 pages and it has been trouble free. I have since bought two more for other employees and have added one for my home office use. I see other ratings where document feeding has been a problem - it has not been for our company at all. This is a good mid-level vanilla document PDF scanning device. It is not for fancy/odd shaped pages or for damaged documents. It works very well for this basic business use."
1,terrible everything,"Spent almost an hour and a half with HP techs, what fun, and they determined the product defective, gave me a case number but now they can't seem to find it, and I get to start all over again and, in a foreign language - a nightmare. It's a 500 dollar doorstop. In the meantime, bought a Fujitsu FI-5120C like I should have done in the first place."
2,Knitters a needle short,"I agree with Tinhorn - this is a disappointing effort. After the first CD, definitely a step down....not a total loss, but rather lifeless."
1,Game of errors,"I have tried to install this game on three different computers. After a lengthy installation process, when I try to run the application, I get an error message that a file is missing."
3,Nothing like an ash bat really...,First thing i noticed about this composite bamboo is that it well manufactured. The barrel and handle meld beautifully. It is well balanced as I would expect. The real disappointment came when I turned it loose on some batting practice pitching and noticed a bit of a sting even on balls hit squarely on the barrel. The bat felt like it was going to shatter even during well hit line drives. My old ash bats feel way more solid...
4,Great but some ingredients are hard to find,"Went to Colombia and fell in love with the food. This great recipe book covers much of what I ate while visiting Colombia. However, some ingredients are not readily available. Some can be found in stores specializing in latin foods and some are not available at all, i.e. lulo."
4,great tool with a bit of practice,"I got this paddle for carrying my bread dough from the marble board onto the baking stone in the oven.On my first use, I completely messed up the dough shape, because there was not enough flour on the paddle and the flip over was not prompt enough. After some practice, you get the move and this tool became indispensable!"
1,Split in half,I bought this three months ago. Initially it worked great but after a few uses it split in half.
4,"Good, but picture is not representitive","This is a good product, thin but not too thin, easily scoops up the most fickle baked goods, but the picture is not representative of the actual shape. The measurements are, however, accurate. Look for my picture for actual representations. Oh, and I oiled the peel with mineral oil, like a cutting board."
4,It's a pizza paddle. How complicated could it be?,"It's a pizza paddle and does what I need it to do.The shovel is a bit thick, I find, but I'm a novice baker.I wonder if the wood will split down the middle over time, but I'll burn that bridge when I come to it.The product shipped in a giant cardboard box. It was kind of hilarious, other than the fact that it was quite wasteful."
5,Must have!!,This is the best book that I have found on eclectus!!!! Must have for all ekkie owners!! Everything you need to know is in this book
4,uncanny,"Fulwood Babylon sounds like it sampled that one track on Stereolab's ""Mars audio"" album......hmmmm."
5,A prayer for all ages,This book is a beautifully done work explaining a completely beautiful prayer. It will help a beginner to more fully understand and someone who has been saying the Rosary for years to grow in their understanding and appreciation for this wonderful form of prayer.
4,Works great. Upgrade smooth. Long time user.,"I have used Quicken Basic for over ten years, upgrading every year. I consider myself an advanced user since I try and use almost all their (free) features and options. I stopped upgrading with Quicken 2002 because that version had all the features I wanted. But starting this year (January 2005), I kept getting warnings about no support for 2002. So, I upgraded to Quicken 2005. The process went very smoothly. I track 10+ online accounts (checking, savings, brokerage, IRAs, credit cards). They all downloaded just fine after the upgrade. I like 2005 better than 2002 although 2002 was adequate for my needs. I do like 2005's budget feature much better. Also, Quicken Basic 2005 seems to be geared more towards the home user instead of the business user. This version just like all the other versions works just fine. The upgrade was easy and seemless. No loss of data or functionality, at least for me. Thank you Intuit, keep up the great product!"
4,"Good at what it does, but doesn't help to get out of debt","I find Quicken to be good at what it's supposed to do -- track and manage expenses, creating reports to see spending trends, and paying bills. But, I found it was lacking in providing me direction on how to get out of debt. I found this direction, however at www.onepaycheckatatime.com. This web site has interactive that guide you through the process of targeting and paying down debt on a paycheck by paycheck basis. I use it in coordination with Quicken to guide me on which bills to pay, when and how much. Try it!"
2,Hit and Miss,"HDMI Cables arrived in clear plastic bags. Tied in 2 out of the three into an HDMI splitter from my xbox360 and ps3. Xbox's cable worked well, but the xbox got confused and I needed to manually set the video output (most likely because of the HDMI splitter). The PS3's video output was flashing, and there was static in the audio. Tried manually adjusting the output settings there to no avail. Swapped out the PS3's HDMI cable with a different cable from my purchase, and the problems went away.2 out of the 3 cables worked. I always thought that quality of the cable was of little to no concern as HDMI is digital - it either works or doesn't. I was wrong. You may want to spend a little more money on a more reputable cable."
1,displeased,"Extremely displeased with this product. You might as well buy the cheapest and most inexpensive HDMI cables you can find instead of these. I purchased thinking that I would receive a little bit higher quality product, but that was not the case. It turns out they are the ""Value"" series, and arrive in a clear bag with no manufacturer name. I tried to use them with a new 1080p TV I purchased and could not get a picture on most of the HD cable channels. Switched out with a pair of higher quality HDMI cables and was able to recieve the channels."
4,something for everyone,"Joey Mac has a different sound and you will love it. What a great album, something for everyone, little irish music, a little rap, a little everything. Made me want to see the movie again"
1,Not good.,This is not nearly as portable as I had hoped and the grill surface it tiny. I sold it at a garage sale and was thrillted to get $5 for it and get it out of my life forever.
5,Awesome,"The keyboard is truly awesome! It took a bit of figuring to get it to work, but once it did, all was fine. My Tablet is much more functional now. It is full size which makes typing very comfortable."
5,Exactly the everyday dishes I was looking for...,"I've owned a couple of sets of Corelle dinnerware through the years and gave both sets away because I used them so long (without breaking any pieces) that I grew tired of the pattern. This time I decided I wanted a plain white dinnerwear set for everyday use. When I did an Internet search, this Corelle set came up. I bought it, and I'm very pleased with my purchase. I highly recommend it."
4,"Great quality, though not the most attractive","I have had a problem for awhile now where I kept breaking dishes in my sink. I recently moved into an apartment that has a ceremic type material sink. [...]Though these things aren't great with the design department, they stack well, are hard to break and/or chip, & how can you go wrong with frost white?I would have given them 5 stars, but they don't have anything *extra special* to warrant a 5th star."
5,Corelle Dinnerware Set,I was very pleased when looking for a set of dishes (last minute) for my college-bound son. Rooming with 4 other young men I needed something indestructable and microwaveable. The 34 piece set met our needs exactly with the price being lower than anything I could find at our local discount and department stores. It arrived in time for their first meal in their apartment.
5,LCD TV cleaner,Product arrived next day and works as advertised. Cleaned TV screen without leaving any streaks.
5,Great monitor cleaner,"Bough it 5 days ago and cleaned all of my displays - lcd tv set, laptop and my new Mac.No mess and spills so far. All the dirt inc. fingerprints and dust removed in seconds."
2,Could be better,This book seemed to be largely a retelling of Plutarch's Fall of the Roman Republic with selected thoughts and quotes from Appian to offer a counter point or descriptive text from the original Latin source. There were several chapters that were informative and had some good comments and observations. The chapter on the formation of the legion was pretty good over all a reading of Plutarch's Fall of Rome can convey the same information.I would recommend From the Gracchi to Nero: A history of Rome from 133BC to AD 68 as a better book on the subject.
1,Bad Advertising,I ordered a textbook and received a study guide. The advertising for the paperback never mentioned that the paperback was the study guide. I returned it for a refund.
3,Criminal Justice: Alabama Original Materials,My College daughter received this new book. Problem was it was an oldier edition and not the 9th that she needed. Company was accomodating in saying to return the item for credit and that they did not have the newest edition. I would deal with this company again.
2,How can you make a female vampire movie so un-erotic?,"I honestly don't see how it's possible to make a film about a female vampire preying on other women and have it turn out this lame. The plot was confusing enough, but that wouldn't have bothered my had the girl-girl scenes been hotter. Instead we've got one goth girl kind of flirting with this other very attractive girl in a bar, and then there's another disjointed story involving a female vampire engaged in a really weak lesbian scene with another girl. And, of course, they add some guys just to complete the lack of overall eroticism. Clearly, here's an idea for a potentially really good lesbian vampire story that was watered down by a producer or director who didn't care for the whole lesbian-theme and so instead turned it into this unexciting piece of garbage. Two stars for the attractive female casting and brief female nudity."
2,Get on with it already,"Thisbook had me skipping through love scenes (which I NEVER tire of) to get to the story plot - it was very disjointed. The writing of the characters was rough and the reactions to adversity irrational. This book seemed like a cobbling together of every cliche ever written before in a Romance Novel. Never before have I thought the characters deserved to end up miserable, until I read this. Disappointed."
3,Be careful to not break,This is a handy little carrying case but you must be very careful for it is made with very thin plastic that can break very easily and then the whole cage is of no use.
5,i love it!,greatest blue tooth i have found. easy to hear from (if turned up all the way) and others can hear what people around you are saying for about 6 feet clearly. battery life is as advertised i tested that. only thing i do not like is to connect it to the phone if i can talking it disconnected the call and i cannot get it to work for non calling stuff (like when i play music)besides those 2 things i love it greatly and liked it so much i went and got an extra one!
4,Easy to pair and work perfectly,H300 is easy to pair and connect to the bluetooth device. I am using it with a bluetooth dongle PC850 for voip. Sound is great and never have any trouble except running out of battery. The first set of energizer AAA dry cell lasted almost a month.
5,Great product,I used to have a rechargeable Bluetooth headset and it spent more time charging than anything else.This headset takes a AAA battery which typically lasts 3-4 weeks. I carry a spare in my laptop bag and if the battery runs low it only takes a few seconds to switch it.The sound quality is great.The only downside - I find the side button for volume a bit tricky to use and have accidentally hung up a couple of times during a call.I thoroughly recommend this headset.
4,motorola hp300,"works great, i can leave my phone upstairs and still get good reception on my bluetooth."
4,Volksbluetooth,"Nothing fancy. Truly utilitiarian. I bought becuase I did not want to get caught with a dead rechargable battery. It is a little heavier than most headsets, but not that much bigger. I find it a little uncomfortable. Some reviews claim it fits a little loose. In my case it fits a little tight. Maybe I'm just too sensitive.Bottom line: best bang for the buck out there."
2,Motorola H300 Bluetooth Headset,"I guess you get what you pay for, my device keeps falling apart, the battery cover does not stay close."
1,A lot noise...,"This Bluetooth doesn't work good... Is unconfotable on the ear, and I have a LOT interference with my Treo 650... If I don't hold the phone close to the headset, I can't make a conversation...Definetly, I waste my money."
3,Works well enough,"Overall, it works well enough for my needs.The headset has pretty good reception within 10ft. If you want into another room or beyond 10ft there is noticeable static.I love the fact that I can use a standard rechargeable AAA battery since I mainly use the headset while driving. Plus, the power usage is low.My only real complaint is the awkward buttons on the headset. Turning the device on/off is cumbersome since the main button has multiple functions (e.g. pressing the main button for less than 3 seconds dials the last number and pressing the button for greater than 3 seconds turns it off). Needless to say, I often redial the last number whenever I attempt to turn the headset off."
3,Not the best...,"I recently purchased my first bluetooth enabled cell phone and was really looking forward to using it. I purchased this earphone expecting great things. While others mention the AAA battery as a positive, I'm finding that I need to replace the battery at least once a week. I have had serious problems with echoes, both on my side and the side of the person I am speaking with. Also, the earphone feels floppy and doesn't fit tight against my ear. I am always concerned that it will fall off.So, even though I have only had the earpiece for 2 months, I am shopping for a new one!"
1,Depressing,"Describing this video as amateurish is being polite. Its shockingly bad and depressing. The background music used isn't Van Halen's. That's an ominous sign if ever there was one. The people interviewed are absolute nobodies. With the exception of famed cameraman Neil Zlozwer, producer Andy Johns and Roth's former bodyguard the majority of them are posers and hangers ons. Why should we even concern ourselves with anything they have to say. You won't find a single notable name in the bunch. Instead we're made to suffer through the worthless thoughts of complete nobodies such as a guy who once saw VH performing in college and some freak with a Jennifer Aniston hairdo that operated a VH newsletter who's appearance more resembles that of a Morrissey fan if you catch my drift. WTF? Depressing best describes how I felt about this. Van Halen deserved better."
5,intriguing,"Based on all the negative reviews I went out and bought this documentary. I was fascinated by all the negative comments so, I had to see this production for myself. I got together with a bunch of old Van Halen die hards and we were ready to goof on the piece. Low and behold it was astounding how great it really was. Bits and pieces of our past flashed before our eyes. Before you know it a bottle of Jack was cracked and a joint circled the room. Ah yes, the good old days right in our own living room. Thanks for creating this documentary for my library."
1,1 Star is too much.,"This DVD never got the backing of the band and this is why it is so poorly put together. For any old VH fans out there that are still in 2 minds about buying this piece of trash, just take a look at the amount used up for sale, and have a look back at some previous reviews. The good reviews are only coming from 1 source and thats friends of the makers. The poor reviews are only coming from the poor suckers that got conned into buying it."
1,Desperate!,"Thats the only way I can describe this! So all the people that worked around Van Halen are trying to cash in just because they used to work for them! Proper interviews with the musicians is what the fans want, but maybe because the band has moved on so much over the years, it's just not possible anymore. Either way this DVD has been hyped up far too much."
1,Very disapointed,I wanted to see David Lee Roths videos ot the songs with Van Halen. His performing was the greatest. I've tried to get a DVD with his videos and can't find them. They were great. Tins
1,Put out an early LIVE performance instread!,Many early Van Halen DLR-era performances were videotaped. Please clean some of these up and release them instead!! You'll make a fortune and make all the fans more happy than you can imagine.
1,Van Who-len???,"What the F??? No footage of the band in their early Mammoth or Van Halen years!! Talk, talk, talk.....This DVD is definitely a disappointment. Myfriend Nardos liked it though...."
1,Should be no stars.,"A DVD without a single track of Van Halen played. Thats a new one on me. This DVD is a case of lets cash in, without the copyright people holding us liable. A big seller, NOT! Look on Amazon.co.uk, and see how many copies of this DVD are up for sale as used already after what? 1 week of sale? If you are 50/50 about buying this DVD, maybe wait for some other reviews to appear after 9 December before wasting your money."
1,As exciting as watching paint dry.....,'I've finally got Van Halen in my house' was a load a bol***ks! This DVD is a rip off and only friends of the makers will tell you otherwise!!!!!
4,Finally!!,I am so glad this is FINALLY coming out!! The crazy hillbilly jokes and characters are priceless.
3,one problem,"I wasnt aware it was ""full screen"" then again it may just be how the dvd was made but other than that flaw. fast shipping and in good condition."
2,disappointed,We were quite disappointed in this item I bought for my son's boy scout outings. There were no instructions so it took some time figuring some parts out and the flashlight did NOT work. It just proved to us once again a tool that can do everything is too good to be true.
1,Disgusting,"I bought this sauce at a local asian food store. I brought it home and used it to make Kung Pao chicken. However, it had so much vinegar and salt there really wasn't a taste. I also bought a Peanut Sauce from Dynasty, which tasted almost the same as the Kung Pao sauce because again, there was an extreme abundance of vinegar and salt. Do not buy this product if you actually like good Chinese food. Hell, even if you like bad Chinese food, you could probably find a better sauce."
4,"Yes, It DOES work with Windows XP","I've had this printer for approx. 3 months now and I'venever had any problems with it at all. The box it came inincluded a sheet that specifically noted that it is compatiblewith Windows XP. I use Windows XP and enjoy using all ofthis printer's functions. It's a snap to install the programsand to assemble. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because Ifind it a tad bit slower to print than other printers....butthen again, I'm used to printing on higher-teched printers."
1,frustrated,"We purchased the X63 from Home Depot and it was the worst mistake we made. We have had it for over a year now and we still can't get it to work. The only solution we receive from tech support is to unplug the USB port and phone line, turn computer off/on and re-plug everything in. It will work for about a day or two and then start giving us ""error messages"" We purchased a Lexmark printer before and had problems with that. We should havelearned our lesson. Stay away from this machine."
4,Vaughan Williams revisited,"This is another excellent bio film from Tony Palmer. Today Vaughan Williams seems to be a forgotten composer in North America. This film rekindled my interest in him and I am currently returning to his music by listening to his symphonies and his Masque Job. Much of the symphonic music is played brilliantly by the National youth Orchestra of Great Britain, an orchestra which Vaughan Williams helped to start.I found the film very touching and I would recommend it to anyone interested in British music in the first half of the 20th century."
3,Are squats really super?,"This book was okay, but it was far from great. I can save you some time and money by summarizing it right now for you. The workout: Squat. Squat a lot. 1 set for 20 reps. Add 5 pounds each workout if you can. The nutrition: Drink milk. Drink lots of milk. Aim for at least a gallon a day. Don't expect to gain anything even close to the 30 pounds claimed in this book from this program, though. In all honesty, this is about all you will learn from this book. Save your money and buy something else."
1,The only thing I gained was bad gas.,"Drinking that much milk caused my gastrointestinal system to have a mind of it's own. After incessant pleading from my roomates and strange stares at the gym, I ceased drinking that much milk. The flatulence then subsided and my roomates were very pleased. In the end this program gave me nothing except a nice extra inch on my gut although this may have been from the gas. What can I say buy at your own risk. Remember your intestines love you."
2,Disappointing,"Not much meat to this. Buy the t-shirt that says ""just shut up and squat"" and you probably are good to go."
3,Can't get a good focus with this lens,"I've had this lens for approximately 4 months and have now had the chance to shoot in a number of situations. I use this lens on my Nikon F100 with slide film. It is a good lens in many ways. Its compact, quiet and quick. Just one problem....the focus is not SHARP, especially at infinity. It is frustrating and I want to dump the lens because of this. I know its not a pro-lens, but the sharpness is NOT acceptable to me at least."
5,met my expectations,I really like this lens. I'm an advanced non-pro. lens is great for travel; the only one I used on a recent trip to Disneyland. the location of the zoom ring is different than other lenses of this size I've used so I kept turning the focus ring. I use a D100; autofocus and all other features worked great. I would recommedn this lens for what I paid.
2,Not what it seems,"This DVD has no movies on it, it is basically a listing of her top movies. The DVD plays the original movie reel intro's from the adverts in the cinema pre release of the film. Still interesting to watch.But really its only advertising."
2,I paid for this why?,"This book seemed like an attempt by the publisher to squeeze some more money out of Asimov's name. The stories read like someone went through all of his collected writings and picked whatever hadn't been published yet. I found the inclusion of his incomplete essays and introductions to different shared-world series to be expecially annoying, as they had no follow-up. The centerpiece of the book, the story of a producer attempting to make a play out of ""The Gods Themselves"" was simply too boring for me to get through. I'd much rather have found it in a library, so I wouldn't have been fooled into paying for it."
1,order carefully,This collection was originally advertised as being four Paramount movies plus a documentary!! So I ordered and just receuved it and it has NO MOVIES!This is a complete deception!
2,This is not the movies,It looks like a waited collections of unreleased movies on DVD but it is a trunk full of nice pieces but of course not the real stuff.The idea of the collection sounds like a trick to attract fans like me. Not the funniest joke about the Marx Brothers.Please release the movies on DVD !!!!
2,Amazon tries to weasel out,"Got this for a gift. Three of the discs won't even play. I was at least interested in having the content, so I sent it back to exchange. Amazon is deducting a ""restocking"" fee that is roughly half of the price of the set! There is no restocking to be done - it is a DEFECTIVE SET. They are not sending a replacement, apparently until I cough up another $13. The discs are defective. It is THEIR fault. The set rates 2 stars, the customer service is a 0."
5,Movies - try amazon.co.uk,"Ozbenjy,Amazon.co.uk has recently been selling a 4 disc set with 4 Marx Brothers movies - I believe that they are cleaned up prints - can't say for sure as my copy hasn't arrived yet."
3,So disappointed,The title is VERY misleadingI was expecting a collection of the movies but instead it is comprised of old clipsDon't buy if you are expecting the movies
4,The evolution of a classic on quality,"Each edition of this book reflects the state of the art on Quality at the time it was published, so the text included on each edition tends to change in order to keep updated. This fifth edition accomplish the objective of bringing us the best on Quality systems with concepts that go from classical to innovatives.""The Handbook"" is a book that must be on any quality specialist's shelf. It doesn't have the absolute truth about quality but it can give you many hints...Why the fifth star is missing?, because this edition is a little dated (ISO-9000/1994). But if you want to ""embrace the quality"" you should be looking for this edition, the next and the previous editions in order to get the whole picture about the evolution of quality. You'll never regret about this investment."
5,Delightful Regency Adventure!,"I've long been a Miranda Jarrett fan, but I'll admit that the premise for this book (a gaming house in Regency London run by the daughters of a country minister) sounded pretty far-fetched for an author who used to write about the American Revolution.I shouldn't have worried. Jarrett's talents make this story completely believable, and a whole lot of fun, too. The workings of the gaming house are well-researched, and I was fascinated by all the details of the card games (surprisingly like Vegas and Atlantic City without the slots.) It's great for a change to have Regency characters who haven't been handed everything in life with their titles, but have to make their own way. The hero wasn't exactly the rake of the title, but he was still pretty tasty, and I just love the three Penny Sisters. I'm sure there's at least one sequal in the works. Can't wait!!"
3,"Do not believe ""it ships in 1-2 days""","I don't know how good the camera is, because I have not received it, but I do know that I placed the order based on it ""usually ships in 1-2 days, and my account at this time indicates that it is supposed to be shipped in 7 days."
4,A GREAT NOVEL!!,"Murphy and Cochran have done themselves well with this novel. Although I liked The Forever King better, this novel also intrigued me.First of all, let me list the few faults this novel had compared to the first one: it was a lot darker than the first novel, it had too much on the history of the characters, and it didn't even develop the evil character, Aubrey Katsuleris (Thanatos). Sure, he was developed in some way, but Cochran and Murphy could have taken out about 15 of the 70 or so historical pages involving Arthur and Taliesin, and put Katsuleris into it.Next, the good things: it displayed Merlin's past, which is good in some ways, we got to see the knights come together again, the bad guy was a lot better in this one, and it was just so great! Worth reading, although I advise you all to read The Forever King before this one."
3,Worth the read,"While I did not enjoy this book as much as The Forever King, it is a good book - The Forever King dealt much more with King Arthur's Fifth Century Britain and I enjoyed that immensely. The Broken Sword picks up where The Forever King left off in today's time period but it dealt much more with Merlin's story. It just depends on which story you are more interested in. I am very excited about the next book and hope it is published soon.As a side bar, if the authors are reading this review - I would really like to see the stories of Hal's (Galahad) lives through the centuries as he has been reborn looking for Arthur.Very good books! Don't miss them!!"
2,A bit disappointing,"The is a sequel to The Forever King and, like most sequels, it doesn't measure up. Pass it by."
3,"Hey, it's OK.","It's OK to like this book. it's friendly, it's fuzzy, it's... it is, in the end, a kid's book written for adults. Or an adults book, written for kids. Thoroughly enjoyable, a good adventure based on all the old stories and fables. It's a yarn that needed to be told (wasn't Arthur known as the once and future king?) and Cochran and Murphy tell it well.The sequel will be interesting - a republican king? And what will Charles, Camilla, Henry, and all that pasty-faced lot do?Listen - if you have any interest in the Arthurian stories, you'll have to read it, because it does add to the lexicon.But if you want something that tells what Arthur and Co. might have really got up to, go to Amazon's Bernard Cornwell site, and buy the Winter King series. Now, that's Arthur!"
5,A WORK OF ART!!! JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST,I can't say enought about this book. It was just as good as its counterpart. I hope that there is a third book soon. The details Molly Cochran and Warren Murphy put into this book are so great that you almost can see what is actually happening. I recommend this book to anyone who loves great books no matter what type you enjoy reading. Just read the first few pages and you will be hooked.
2,unnecessary satan stuff....,"I have to agree with several of the latest reviews of this book. I read the ""Forever King"" in a book club earlier this year and enjoyed the creative take on the Author legend, so decided to borrow the sequel for some fun summer reading! I had to finish just for my piece of mind after the disturbing and unnecessary satanic ritual scenes. Too much emphasis on evil, and not enough on the special qualities of Author(?)if any... I have also read many different takes on the Authorian legends like a previous reviewer and my personal favorite is ""Mists of Avalon"", by Marion Zimmer Bradley. Try that one."
3,Solid adventure!,"I enjoyed this movie(not as much as I liked Captured In Her Eyes). The plot is okay, but there is alot of action to make up for it:)I felt the mystery was good, but when you discover who the killer is you get disappointed:( You get to see the Men in Black in action though:)"
2,"Commercial, Modern","While I'll not dispute the other reviewers comments, it is worth mentioning that a) most of the structures profiled are commercial buildings and b) virtually everything is very modern architecture.What my wife and I hoped to see was something more in tune with the residential, traditional homes most people live in.One need only think of courtyards in southwestern architecture, decks and outdoor living areas, living rooms with French doors and transom windows overlooking a woodsy area, and the verandas on southern homes to picture what we were looking for.If this is what *you* are looking for, this isn't the book for you."
3,"Great for inner thigh and glutes, but not much else.","Kathy spends too much time explaining proper form, if you are an advanced exerciser you already know proper form.Too many reps for the weight exercises, and her faster tempo reps are too fast. Instead of flailing my arms about trying to keep up, I go at a slower more controled pace for fewer reps. She does so many reps that even when I go slower, I can do plenty in the same amount of time.All the weight work is upper body, all the cardio is lower body. Not really my style. There are better videos out there. I felt like it really worked my inner thighs/glutes but not much else."
2,sex for complete morons,"I was told to read this book when I was engaged, and it's a marvel of unintentional humor. The best part is the testimonials from newlywed couples who tell their honeymoon horror stories about how sexually dysfunctional they were/are. Later, I was able to read exce3rpts of it with my then engaged brother. For about an hour, we laughed harder than I can ever remember laughing, until we finally forced ourselves to put the book down.Basically, this book is marketed toward the hyper-religious crowd who has been deathly afraid of anything sexual. If you fall under this category, I suppose this book might be useful to you, but if you don't have a neurotic fear of physical intimacy, this book will be a terrific laughing stock."
4,Great Product...but...,"This is a great product. It is not cost-effective, however, to order only one tube through Amazon (doesn't actually ship from Amazon) because of the shipping charge."
1,Does nothing...,"I don't understand how this could get over 1 star from anyone; it offers relief from dry hands for about 10 seconds, then you need to look for some Aveeno (which offers immediate relief and lasts for hours). Total waste."
5,Very Nice Set,"microwave safe, easy to clean, very firm and nice color...I can not request more for a 20$ set. Highly recommanded!"
3,GLASSES,"I AM DISSAPOINTED WITH THE GLASSES WITH THE SET. EVEN WITH HAND WASHING, THREE HAVE ALREADY BROKEN. I PURCHASED A SECOND SET, THIS TIME WITH THE MUGS. THEY SEEM TO BE QUITE DURABLE."
5,unique and wonderful,"Very unusual and somewhat out-there music, 100% devoted Christian lyrics, has become one of my favorite CD's. Is that Larry Ferarri on the CD jacket??"
5,Hawaiian Music,Great if you love Hawaiian music. This is a good group that sings traditional as well as modern Hawaiian music.
3,Toy,"A good stocking stuffer, no more. Don't expect a whole lot from this toy. I was hoping it would be more high quality like a ribics cub, but it's cheap plastic."
4,Good quality,Bought these as a gift for my sister and brother in law. Has stood up to one year of hard service and looks nice next to the fireplace. Keeps the wood handy and off the floor.
1,Peck Fans are Ripped off,This DVD is nothing but trailers. Once again you the customer are falsely lead to believe this is an actual true film collection with Gregory Peck. Do not buy this unless you are trying to buy everything to do with Gregory Peck for a museum. Otherwise this is a waste of time and money. Read carefully and you will see this is just trailers. They just did not call it Gregory Peck Trailer Collection.
3,Call Bionaire Directly,"If you have a Bionaire console humidifier, you need these wicks, which should be replaced roughly every two months.But as much as I enjoy using Amazon (been a Prime member for years), this is not the product to purchase from Amazon. Call Bionaire directly. Instead of complaining about getting a non-Bionaire replacement, you'll get the genuine product, often for less. As I write this, they are having a 40% off sale on filters -- filters <$8, wicks <$10 per pair -- and free shipping on orders over $25.NOTA BENE: Bionaire no longer includes the plastic frames with the wicks, either, SO KEEP YOUR FRAMES! Also, they sell the wicks as a single item, not a twin pack, so for my W-9 I needed to order in pairs."
2,"NOT Bioaire, not with wick holder as shown",I had a number of choices on where to buy these wicks. I chose this company because the said BIOAIRE and showed the wicks and holders.They lied.The wicks sent seem to work OK but choosing by price and value I might have chosen a more Honest company
3,Not suitable for full gowns,"Granted I wasn't sure what lenght bag I would need for my gown/dress, since I am only 4'11"". But this bag is NOT suitable for a prom or formal gown. It does not expand to accomidate the full bottom. Probably great for regular size dresses or gowns for girls under age 8."
2,Not what I expected,The bag is very thin. It doesn't stand on its own. I expected a bad that I could you for my two children under 2. This didn't allow me to easily pack the bag or find items already inside. I am returning the bag shortly. Also the color was not exactly what I expected.
5,calling all girlfriends,I am recommending to all my single girlfriends...it's what you know in your heart but sometimes need to read...
4,GREAT DVD,"Loved the message - worrying does not in any way changes the outcome of situations, therefore STOP IT."
1,Horrble compare to Microsoft Version,"I just purchased it today, and I was utterly suprised at it's short coming. I love Quicken, but Quicken for Mac is horrible.Keep your money."
1,The Single Worst Money Management Program EVER!,"Whats the FIRST thing you want to do after importing or downloading all you financial data from your bank.......? You want ot sort them by CATEGORY so you can find out how you spend your money, right? You CAN'T do that with this software. It's FIND and REPLACE utility does not display MULTIPLE transactions by Payee or Number or Amount or Category. It does one transaction at a time. How are you supposed to find all your Starbucks coffee transactions and change them to the category of DINING OUT? Do you go through each transaction seperately, for each of your thousands of transaction? This is the most basic function of FINANCIAL MANAGMENT software. What are those idiots over at Intuit thinking?"
2,Not worthy of time,"Nothing earth shattering here. Maybe my expectations were too high as soo many folks recommended this book. Unless you've never read ANY career advice book, I'd suggest another."
1,ugh,"Time and time again, I've given these guys a shot. For one, they're usually booked with really cool bands!!! Second, a buddy of mine used to nail the singer and never ceases to amaze me with his testimonials about her 'range'. So, I picked this album up, despite the fact that their later stuff has usually dissapointed. The only track on here that didn't nausiate me was the second. It was sweet and melodic. The rest? Junk it! Get it out of here! The fuzz-guitar is weak, the lyrics are whacked, and Vanity's voice is best battributed to some terrible experience as a child, that must have marred her psyche, and crippled her vocal abilities. Oh, the screetching! I must say, the drums were actively seeking my approval, and the bass backed it up like a trooper, but nothing could save this mess. Seriously, gents and germs - stay away!"
1,picture,please send me the image/picture of this set as i want to buy it. i wnat to know whether glasses have rosemarie patern/design as they do on plates and bowls.
3,Collection Only,I have every TOP CD except for 2 of them. This Item is more for your collection like the previous person stated. I do like 4 songs on this CD. I would say for hardcore TOP fans...
2,Not pleased at all with this dock!,"I have a 80gb iPod classic which I bought this dock for. Let's just say I never even got it off the ground, so I can't really comment on the working functionality of it. My unit did not work right off the bat - the battery tray was broken in the remote, and the main unit would not turn on. The construction (particularly the remote) is EXTREMELY flimsy. I returend it right away. I'm still looking for a good solution here.I would reccomend against this dock for the quality issues. Usually I like Belkin products but I just can't say anything for this, except that it does look nice and is a nice compact size."
1,Unreliable Performance & Terrible Remote,"The Belkin TuneCommand A/V Dock worked flawlessly right out of the box, albeit very briefly. The remote control is extremely cheap & flimsy, and would never withstand a drop to the floor. As promised, the remote's RF signals will control the ipod through walls, however it's setup & sync procedure requires constant reprogramming, as the remote loses sync with the base way too frequently, essentially making the entire unit worthless. 50% of the time when you pick up the remote, it will not work, or the base station won't perform the correct function. I doubt if there is more than a dollar or two worth of materials going into the production of this product. Not recommended."
3,No Song Menus on TV,"I was expecting to see Song Titles and iPOD menus on TV but this device does not support that capability. It it solid looking device, very easy to set-up but since I really wanted to see all the titles on the TV and it does not supports it, I am sending it back."
5,excellent service,The Item arrived in good condition and in a timely fashion. It is a gem and quite a steal for the price.
3,Nice chair but a bit smaller than expected,"I bought this product as a gift and it shipped quickly but was much smaller than expected. It appears to be good quality, just wish it was larger."
2,The tropical fruit flavor is MUCH better than the grape,"I make homemade fruit leather (with some added sugar) for backpacking trips, so my family is used to a fairly sweet product. My son (age 17) and I tried this fruit leather for the first time. He thought the grape tasted like plastic. I thought it tasted better than plastic, but that it could use a stronger fruit flavor. He rated it 1, and I would rate it 3. The flavor of the tropical fruit is much better than that of the grape."
1,A New Use for Drip Pans,Good news: the two 6-inch pans in this absurdly over-priced set do fit Kenmore ranges. The 8-inch pans can be used by children as headgear on Halloween.Bad news: the two 8-inch-pans don't fit Kenmore ranges.Result: you end up paying three times the cost of a superior set of drip pans at K-Mart (where I eventually bought mine)--and your kids are walking around with black pans on their heads.
3,too small,I was disappointed when these arrived they were a good price but the big size was about an inch to small. The little ones fit perfect but I wish the big ones did because now I have two black and two silver
5,handy for travel use,"Delivered in the time specified. Small, compact and is great for plugging in you ipod at a hotel."
2,Freshlock Replacement Rolls,"I'm not sure about this product. I still haven't used it. The bags are really thin which leaves a lot to be desired. The cost is really low and the rolls are nice and long. I'm just not sure if it will protect your food in the freezer as well as the other heavier bags can and does. When I finally get around to using it once, I'll let you know. If it works out, then I'll try one of their machines to seal the food with. The reviews I have read so far is not encouraging and has kept me from doing anything with it or buying the machine to seal the bags with."
5,It was worth the wait!,"I can't say anything that hasn't already been said by my fellow reviewers here. I DID write a kind of unabashedly obsequious review of the ""Live Fanny"" CD a couple of years ago, so apply that to this. THANK YOU June, Jean, Nickey, and Alice for some of the absolute finest Rock 'n Roll in the early Seventies. 5/1/07...A later note...I just obtained Buffalo Springfield's second album: No question, no question at all: FANNY did an infinitely superior, even more...""venomous"" version of ""Special Care"" (the fourth song on the first side of ""Charity Ball"") than did Stills & co."
2,Honestly...might not be worth it to some....,I'll come right out and say it...a poor follow up of ISOS 4. You'd figure the last tracks on each CD would blow you away like the others but it leaves you hanging. Hardly any build up tracks. Granted I bought the CD due to the success and great albums previous. I have to say...I caught myself skipping some tracks which I never do to any tiesto cd. Those looking for a great album check on Armin Van Buuren's latest...thats what Tiesto should have sounded like.
2,Tiesto # in search of sunrise L.A.,I am very dissapointed that Tiesto did such a poor job selecting the tracks on this cd. This is a the weakest performace on his part and I regret buying it. The best is to see him when he is live he was incredible @ The Manssion in Miami.
3,First CD dope Second CD BLAAAA,"WHOOAAWW tiesto my man what happend, a great set of mixes called ISOS was coming along to be one of the best ever created by a man but here he comes and ruins the rep that is the reason that he got droped down to number to 2 Paul Van Dyk. i just hope his producton cd ( WICH IS DONE AND IS SET 2 REALEASE NEXT SUMMER TIESTO FANS)is a reallyyyyy reallyyy good one cuz matchng just be n in my memory is gono be hard especially with a a mix cd that that eww. latin Amercia there isnt a song u cant not like but this one ...."
3,Was Waylon Drunk?,"I consider Waylon to be THE BEST modern cajun artist, but I don't know what happened with this album. This whole album, lyrics and CD cover are in modern francais, not acadiene or english. Waylon must have been trying to market this album to mainstream France, because there's not much cajun sound to this album. It's more like 50's pop. But since Waylon is otherwise a jammin' Cajun, I'll forgive him for this one."
3,Mmm....ok shoe but...great for the price,"Overall, I'm really satisfied with the shoes. It's not as white as I hoped it would be, but it contrasted very nicely with my dark jeans. The leather isn't too good though. After a couple days at school, the leather already has some mysterious rip/hole? Though miniscule, it's enough to bother me. =\ Overall though, I am happy with the shoes just because it's ADIDAS and the look is nice and simple."
1,Not good,These were old and brittle wasted my money. Just go buy a new trimmer head. That is what i did.
4,Fresh and Funny Spoof,"""The Musical of Musicals: The Musical"" is a catchy, kitschy, lovingly ripped-off show; it's not the first, it won't be the last, but-thus far-it is the funniest!The show tells one story five times over: a girl cannot pay her rent. She faces eviction, unless she does something for her landlord. In the end, her hero comes and pays the rent. Tale as old as time, huh? What makes it so great is that it is told in the style of 5 different composers: Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb.The best by far is ""A Little Complex"", the Sondheim version. The Jerry Herman songs, ""Dear Abby"", are also very funny.A little note: if you are not a musical theatre fan, skip this album. It makes a lot of references that will likely go right over your head.If you are a fan, however, immediately add this witty score to your cart!"
2,eh,"it's fruity. it's leathery... but is that really all you expect from your fruit leather? personally i like mine a little less leathery and a little more chewy. The fruit has also been 100% liquified before dehydration, so there is a weird, soylent-green like uniformness to the texture. I will stick to 365 (Whole Foods) brand for now."
5,Great Snack,"I love this snack, it's not too sugary and is healthy for the kids. I would recommend this any day over fruit rollup or other similar products."
2,Ick,"While these do have a great ingredient label, the texture and flavor are, IMO, off-putting. I bought the strawberry, but it tastes like a cross between apple and pear ... and leaves a strange taste in my mouth. But the texture is particularly odd.For years I made my own fruit leather. Guess I'll have to back to it.I really don't like writing negative reviews, but if I had really paid attention to the poor reviews here, I probably wouldn't have bought this. I just hope I can save someone else from making the same mistake."
1,Tastes like cardboard,All I have to say is that this has a TINY taste of strawberry and the texture is like if you put a piece of cardboard in your mouth. Very dissapointed...
1,Don't buy,I received my item on time but once I opened it the bars were brown and uneatable. I would not recommend this this item to anyone.
3,Good,I bought these thinking that I got a really good deal but I think that you can get them cheaper at Costco. The convenience was nice but probably not worth another purchase.
4,Healthy Candy!,"I like the idea of giving my grandson a treat that he thinks is candy and he seems to really enjoy it.It is kind of brown looking and very soft and sticky so I was skeptical, (nothing like fruit roll-ups like I expected) but he ate every bite!The down side is the price.. I bought it when it was on special pricing, with auto ship but it was expensive to re-order so I cancelled auto-ship. I would not buy on a regular basis just because of price. It is now available at Costco as well."
4,Two big stars get their guest shots,"After Carol Burnett's attempts to get the legendary entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr. on the show, she finally succeeds in Volume 8. A sketch about fame & racism kicks off the show, relying more upon character than jokes to get laughs, which is telling but not preachy. The show is capped with a Jamaican-flavored musical production which employs the entire cast.Next, there is the wonderful Shirley MacClaine, who joins Carol in a nostalgically amusing number about fan mail, and the show's traditional musical production, a classy number, and again starring Carol & Shirley. As a performer, MacClaine shows us her versatility, and it's also a reminder that the Carol Burnett Show offers more than just laughs."
3,Bad Wolf Gaming,"It's been great for adding to our gaming ideas and campaigns and I have even been able to use it as a cross-over into Forsaken. But I am an Apocalypse fan over Forsaken so it's an easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to execute book."
4,Not an extremly bad book...,"I read this book a few years ago, so I might have a few things wrong, but it was a fairly good book. The characters were well developed(as always), and there was some mistery and suspence, but it dosen't have 'edge off your seat excitment' as the book promises, unless your an eight year old. If your a true Indy fan, you should buy this, but otherwise I would just read it at the library."
2,Buggy router firmware,"I had to return the router because the wired connection to my desktop dropped the internet connection every few minutes and I had to reboot the computer/dsl modem/router everytime to reset the connection. Apparently, this was a common problem of people who connected to the internet via PPOE. I do not understand how Microsoft delivered this product without proper testing; I guess it is just like their operating systems and other software: Just rush them out to the market and the fixes will follow.The wireless PCMCIA card worked just fine, I must admit. But since I wanted a complete set of hardware, I returned both."
1,Microsoft is getting out of Wifi business! Bad cust ser wil,"FYI. Microsoft is getting out of the Wifi business. So the lousy call service will get worse. They botched the g version loyally as they tried to design it instead relying on SMC like they did on b version. Result? LOUSY hardware! What the hell do they know about hardware anyway.As for calling them, I called and was greeted by someone in US and he promptly handed me to somebody in India and I swear I couldn't understand them (spoke to 2 people).Lousy hardware and service...AVOID AND GET REAL WIFI PRODUCTS FROM LINKSYS, NETGEAR, DLINK OR HOST OF OTHERS.PS - good riddance by unloading it on ebay."
1,Amateurish -to say the least,"This is a very superficial book -to use an understatement.No references are given , except for citation from the Bible.One cannot verify the author's statements/interpretations.By the title it seems to me that the author looked for ( and got) the attention of potential buyers , attracted by the spectacular title.Scientifically (and otherwise) the value of this book is exactely zero.Do not buy it."
3,Much as I'd like to praise it...,"There's a lot of amazing new music being made in Japan. I'd love to be able to promote Motor Humming as part of that -- their musicianship is considerable, they're probably great to see live, and this album is tight, well-recorded, smart stuff... but it was all just a little too rock and roll for me, a little too straight ahead, not enough new stuff going on to catch my attention. It was starting to grow on me just before I sold it, but..."
3,Not impressed,I did not find this DVD to be worth the price. I was looking for a good barre class and this wasn't it.
5,Ballet Class DVD,"I liked this DVD. The Vagonava style is different from the RAD that I teach. The demonstrations are clear and the clearly described. I would have liked to have seen more break downs of some of the unfamiliar steps but that might be covered in the DVD's for less advanced classes. Overall I am glad I bought the DVD, it has added a new layer to my teaching and challenges my students to learn and perform other styles of ballet."
4,what use is this book?,"At first glance this book is too much evangelical Christianity, which can alienate people especially Europeans. But it is absolutely brilliant; it gives a complete structure which works for understanding even the most intractable human problems in a marriage , and the questionnaires are easy to use and also the structures proposed are workable and useable; even deliberate non communicators (those who want to muck things up) are dealt with. Can this masterly communicator now write us a book for those who are suffering in non conventional relationhsps, homosexuals, people with no ability to form relationships?We need more of this stuff."
3,Not Bad,This girdle is pretty good. not exactly what i was expecting but it served its purpose wish it was made without the wire it does dig into your skin after a few hours. I like the side zip feature i just wish it would lift your butt too..All in all not too bad..
1,It bothers me,For the price of this and the raving reviews about it winning world class rewards...I can't see why. I put it on and the scent only lasts about 5 seconds. Doesn't work for me apparently.
5,something (Klezmer) for everyone,"I own dozens of Klezmer CD's, and even several Knitting Factory CD's. But nothing prepared me for the range and depth of Klezmer-esque musical expression represented on Knitting on the Roof. It might not be for everyone (hey, what is?) but if you've liked anything the Knitting Factory has put out, you're likely to like this. And incidentally, the day after I first heard this CD, I bought every Jill Sobule CD I could find."
4,Nice Loafer,"Nice loafer, sizing is accurate. My only issue is the leather is a little stiffer than I am used to for Clarks."
2,yoga two gether,"Poor production value you can hear the low tone of the vcr tape spinning the whole time, quite distracting. It is hard to follow because the instructor is not great at descibing the actions, and since you have to keep an eye on the screen at all times. Not for beginers because he does not descibe well. It is probably great for experienced yoga praticioners but not beginers as stated. And just a note I will not be bullied into removing this post by the people who made this video like he did to the last person that gave it a negative review, good day."
1,"The screws are tightening, but they don't have my mind yet.",I'm one of the many angry users over loosing the QIF capability. I have my own program (over a decade old) that writes it. Has anyone found where the replacement (OFX) is documented so I can change my program? Or is that too counter to Intuit's hand on the screws?
5,money 2005 beta tester uses Quicken,"I beta tested Money 2005, even received a free copy of money premium 2005 and I still use Quicken 2005 premium, what does that say for Money 2005? its so cluttered and integrated with the web that its annoying."
1,Downgrade from 2004,I haven't found a single new useful function and they removed QIF support. They didn't even fix the obvious bugs.
4,Yummy,"I've actually just come back from a Deerhoof gig, and it was one of, if not THE best live gigs I've ever been to.I've read some of the other reviews for this album, and I think it's a case of either 'getting' deerhoof or not. I think the album's great because it ISNT perfect, it's perfect in it's imperfections which make it even more charming, and I get the feeling most of the imperfections are deliberate, to make it more interesting. I love it because the music transports you away to a far-away world..a bizarre nostalgic fairy tale adventure. I've given it a 4, just because I didn't think every single song was amazing, but the album as a whole is brilliant - 'Milk Man', 'Giga Dance' and 'Desaparecere' (the first 3 tracks) being my personal favourites."
2,Naaah,"Naah, i can't agree with ya all! I just don't consider it as something valuable. This is just for Fab's maniacs, I think, and should be a mixtape, not a full record to buy in store in normal price. Remixes are pointless, 'new' tracks are nothing special."
4,"A wonderful, rantable gift","As I teen, I can honestly say that I appreciate and adore this little book. During those turbulent years when your thoughts are as scattered as the clothes in your room, you need a journal to sort the chaos, and this is the journal for the job. It's pretty without being fluffy and pink (as much teen-aimed merchandise is), and it has a kooky, offbeat sense of humor that tickles me.Trust me, this is a much better gift than a pair of wool socks."
5,"Funny, revealing, surreal---Definitely worth reading","This book was so funny I couldn't put it down--perhaps because I identified with the main character, a childess woman heading into the end of her fertile years. The book actually changed me--which is a rare and wonderful reading experience--especially if done while laughing out loud.Despite the constant humor (ala Thomas Pynchon), the motivations of the each character's odd behavior(s) seemed very real and revealing to me especially when juxtaposed against lost uteruses, sealed vaginas that have ""closed up shop"" and a world full of erections.It was interesting to see how people depend on each other in a whirlwind of craziness. The book isn't expensive and it's a small investment of your time too--big font on small pages and it starts out with a humorous bang immediately. DO IT! I'm following up by reading F/32, by Eurydice. It is also amazing and impacting."
4,"Not What I wanted, but still OK","Like a previous reviewer said, this CD is not like the other Matrix soundtrack recordings. It does not have your typical 'rage' music good for driving and beating people up.On the other hand, it has a good mix of some techno beats with a more classical feel to most of the songs. It is great music to listen to for the overall 'feel' of the movie, even if you haven't seen it yet. It is also good for studying, as it is less invasive than the previous soundtracks.If you are a fan of the previous orchestral scores for the other Matrix movies, this soundtrack only gets better; if you are looking for the Matrix soundtrack we all know and love, don't hold your breath."
4,Better than velcro,"The only other option for mounting your COL is by the velcro strips supplied with the COL, so this is better than nothing. It takes some work to get it situated and mounted where the COL cord or handpad won't be knocked around by the truss pole knobs. On mine I just bent the mounting flange so that the controller was further from the truss poles."
3,Review of 10K Yellow Gold Diamond Cupcake Pendant,"I recently purchased the 10K yellow gold diamond cupcake pendant. The pendant is beautiful, but smaller than I would prefer. I liked it so much, however, that I kept it anyway and will put it on a smaller chain or on a charm holder."
5,who doesn't love cupcakes?,"I love the little box it comes in and the pendant itself is adorable. Same complaint I have seen here is mine as well. The chain is hopelessly thin but most of these little diamond fashion pendants come with this kind of chain. No big deal I can swap it easily. I did expect it to be a little puffier 3D-ish than it is. It is flat for the most part. But for the $$ I spent on it, it's also not a big deal. I love it."
4,cupcakes for life,My daughter has been taking cupcakes for her birthday parties for 29 years so on her 30th we decided to get a special one for her. She loves the necklace and so do we.
3,A little disapointed,"When I saw the picture i thought the pendant was much bigger and thicker. I actually thought it was a 3-dimensional cupcake and it isn't. It's almost flat.The chain is very thin also. I am giving this to my daughter for her 6th birthday and definetly will replace the chain.Oh, I absolutely loved the cupcake box that the necklace came on."
2,Yellow cup cake pendant is minuscule,The cupcake container was very cute and cupcake size but the jewelry inside was minuscule so that was rather disappointing. I gave away to a young girl because it would not impress any adult ladies.
5,Very pleased with my gift!,"I had put this item on my wish list of Christmas gifts, thinking it was very cute, but that I probably wouldn't receive it. Lo and behold, come Christmas there was my necklace. It isn't exactly as I pictured, it's very delicate. I think I actually like it better though because it doesn't look too kitchsy. I can actually wear this with something other than casual attire. I love it and would definitely recommend purchasing if you're are or know a cupcake gal like me!"
2,Nice try - but has plastic handle,"I was lured in by the fact that these knives were forged and that the metal went all the way through the knife. Not bad. What isn't clear is that the handle, which cases the knife is hollow plastic. The ones that were shipped to me were damaged, and I could easily see how cheap the plastic is surrounding the knife. One bad move and you would be left without a handle - just a long piece of metal. I wasn't expecting $300 knives for this purchase, but with this plastic casing these were overpriced. This would have been a good buy for about $45."
1,Cheap. Not worth the price.,"I bought these from a different retailer. They are very cheap feeling and very light weight. The handles are hollow cheap plastic, aside from the piece of knife that runs through the center. They are very off balance. The blades are thin and feel like they would snap right off. The knife block is a very matte finish - like chalkboard. The knives don't sit properly/evenly in the block - they are not aligned and it makes you want to ""straighten"" them out constantly. The price for these right now is showing 100 bucks! You gotta be kidding me!! These are soooo not worth that price! I paid 60 for the set and they weren't even worth that. Two days ago I saw them at the Christmas Tree Shop store for 30 bucks. They are barely worth the 30. I would not recommed these at all, unless you find them dirt cheap and just need a starter set etc and do not care about quality or durability."
2,KNIFE SET,"WE GOT THIS KNIFE SET FOR A WEDDING GIFT. THEY ARE VERY DISAPPOINTING. FOR STARTERS THEY ARE NOT AT ALL SHARP. SECONDLY, THEY GET RUST MARKS AFTER BEING RAN THROUGH THE DISHWASHER. I DON'T KNOW IF WE GOT A BAD SET OR WHAT HAPPENED, BUT WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED."
3,The book was written in,I wasnt expecting to get a book written in. It ws in good shape and that is true but written in? For a few dollars more I could've had a new one. Next time Ill buy new!
2,For railroad buffs only,"I love authenticity in historical fiction and respect the research that authors do in order to achieve an atmosphere rich in accurate detail. Here, though, Martin's hard work actually gets in the way. This book is so chock full of ca. 1903 railroad terminology and minute details of who did what in an engine yards that it slows down character development and forward movement of the plot. I gave it 60 pages and bailed out. In today's popular fiction market, the author will be lucky if many readers wait that long. If you're a train buff, on the other hand, run (don't walk) and grab a copy of this book!"
2,I'm not worthy,This book has all the elements that should make it one of my favourites. A plucky boy in big grimy Edwardian London; trains; more trains; mysterious deaths etc. But I didn't get it. I couldn't even finish it. It was boring. I still say give it the benefit of the doubt. Buy this book and read it when you'rein a calm state of mind.
4,"Great faucet, but...","I bought this faucet from Amazon about six months ago and it failed. The check valve in the middle of faucet failed and started to leak under the sink. I call American Standard customer service for a warranty claim. I was looking to get a new check valve and re-install; however, American Standard could not ship a five dollar part to California since it did not meet California's low lead requirement. American Standard fully refunded me for the faucet. It took approximately six weeks to get the refund. I bought another American Standard faucet based on Amerian Standard's customer support and lifetime warranty. Key thing to remember is to keep your receipt."
1,"Boring, predictable, thankfully short book",Not my cup of tea... no suspense.. too much heartrending emotions that went on and on but not convincing..
1,Am I missing something??,I thought this book was one of the most predictable and boring books I have ever read. No meat. I guessed what would happen for 200 pages and gave up! Very disappointed.
1,Stay away from this product,"I purchased it one month ago. I connected to Internet using a DSL ethernet modem D-Link DSL-300 T. After a couple of weeks it froze. I was hardly able to make it work again and then, after few days frozen again. I relied upon Microsoft, but i read MN 700 comments only AFTER I purchased it: big mistake."
1,"nice interface, if only it worked","Everything went smoothly, except that thing where it cuts out every three minutes. Microsoft says they'll send me another. We'll see."
3,It was OK,"This is the third cd I bought of her's and on all of them I get that one song that I have to have, I have to hear it all the time and thats it. I don't care for anything else on the cd. I liked a couple of the other songs, but not anything that make me wanna say I have to have it other than ""You are Welcome."" I also like the song with Mary Mary. To be totally honest the song that kinda turned me off the whole cd was the one with Missy. I mean it wasn't even as if she was doing a gospel song, she changed some of the words to say work it for God, basically. I didn't care for it at all and that is really suprising, I love hip hop (gospel), but it was just something about that song I could not get with. Overall the cd was ok, just OK."
4,SIR BATTERY,The battery that I received does not match the picture ---- how ever it fits and works well in my unit. delivery was prompt AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT !!!!
3,Good Nostalgia!,"These 60's hanna barbera toons bring back good memories of my childhood, however I think Young Samson should have been paired with some other toon. Space Kidettes are kinda lame and very forgettable. I still can't figure out why the dog transformed into a lion?"
1,Be careful what you wish for!,"As fundamentally hip as saying ""I have a notebook computer that has a P4 processor,"" this product doesn't even come close to the reliability of what a P3 can do. I've seen two of these Toshiba Satellite 1905-S277 Notebooks in action and both of them have been returned due to fried and overheated processors. P4's are simply not working well with notebook computers. From what many experts have told me, the new Pentium Xeon processor due out in the US in September is a far better processor and will have features that support real GPS capability. For those who have bought this product, my apologies! If you've just bought it, you may have time to send it back! Stick to the P3 processors for now. The P4 processors for notebooks is a ploy to get more money out of consumers before the marketing frenzy begins with Xeon processors this fall."
1,NOT the original documentary OR the video,"This is NOT the original 'making of' documentary that also contained the video single. Instead, it's a 'new' documentary about Band Aid and is made up of clips from the original documentary and some new interviews. It's short, only 23 minutes, so do not expect any kind of in-depth information. Basically, it's a 'hack' program with no original analysis or scholarship. Those expecting the original documentary and song/video will be sorely disappointed. The DVD jacket does NOT make it clear that it is a new program either. AVOID if you are looking for the original 1984 song and making of documentary (which, BTW, has NOT been released on DVD yet - only VHS, Beta in the USA and LaserDisc in Japan - hopefully, we'll get an HD-DVD of the original program.)"
1,Not even a quality coaster...,"When I ordered this there few reviews and SO sorry I did so. I have the wonderful original video (VHS) of the Making of Band-Aid and my family watches it every Christmas season. I only watch VHS around Christmas as I have every other genre on DVD. Any-who, this is a rip-off, not informative, and totally lacks the joy of the original."
4,Autolocking Guitar Hangers,"Very nice product. My only concern is about the nut and bolt connection where the self locking fork meets the rod that mounts to the wall. It allows you to set an angle on the fork so you can hang your guitars close together, like in the music store. The concern is that you cannot really lock it by tightening the nut and bolt. Over time it may loosen and move. NOT a big deal.The locking mechanism was a very pleasant surprise. It was not explained very well on the web site and I found it to be much cooler than expected. I have never seen anything quite like it. I would have given this 5 stars, but I figured I had to account for the nut and bolt."
1,Horrible piece of hardware,Seems to be the general consensus that this thing sucks. It does. It keeps dropping from my wireless network (which I know is good because everything else on it stays on). Software it comes with is horrible. I would seriously recommend finding an alternative.
4,Suffer me,"I purchased this CD used because I only wanted one song that I couldn't find anywhere to purchase as a download (Suffer Me). There are 4 live songs and one that was done with an orchestra. I paid $4.43 and it was well worth it. The CD was in great shape. At first, when I opened it, I thought it was a copy as that is how Matchbox 20 made it look. Very funny once I figured that out!"
1,Rivers,This is a good movies but this dvd is jacked up. A lot of the movie I could not see. The movie would freeze up in some section. Am not happy with it at all.
1,ANTI-RUSSIAN REVIEWERS,This is the true portrayal of some Russians who raped German women in Berlin. But whats funny is that none of you ever asked yourself why did they do this? you see the Germans would rather burn Russian women with their children alive as they laugh with their comrades many of the soviet soldiers who fought in berlin lost their relatives.. the death toll in soviet union was 28 million. but of course none of that matters because russians are after all sub humans and germans are more valuable it doesnt matter.. according to some of the reviews i;ve read on here.
1,BLAH!!,"This is one of the very worst 'book-to-movie' movies I've ever seen. It's a true story but not as portrayed in this awful redo. It's not even close! Read the book, folks! It's extremely well written, and it's easy to make a very much better flick in your own imagination!"
3,COOLER,It is a nice looking product and seems to cool alright. It is easy to use and I like the remote contorl feature.
2,"blows, humidifies, but does not cool.","It can blow, humidify (a lot), but not cool. I tried it with ice and chilled water in a small storage room. It did not ""obviously"" lower the temperature. Increasing fan speed increased humidity but not cooling. This is unfortunate because product looks good and is made well. Manual is poorly written: ""Press this key when adding water or ice, outlet temperature is obviously lower 20 seconds later and indicator is lighted on."" ""The key"" is ""Cooler/Humidifier""."
2,Do not use in hot weather not worth it unless you invest in ice,I am sitting here at 11:19 at night and I am still sweating ...... today in modesto california it was 103 degrees the swamp cooler did nothing for me. if you live in weather above 85 do not use this cooler it would be better to just invest in a portable air conditioner.You will need a lot of ice so prepare for that cost.
1,CRAP,Product does not power on with the supplied adaptor or with the D batteries. Purchased as a holiday gift. Seller will not exchange or refund money. Item is junk and seller is NOT reputable. Just throw your money right in the trash rather than be frustrated.
2,It works...but the buttons are unresponsive,"I have been using this remote for a couple of years now, and it has done it's job. The setup was straightforward and painless, and the remote was able to recognize TV's, VCR's and DVD players (a mix of 4 year old to brand new model electronics). HOWEVER, some buttons are really unresponsive. In particular, my CHANNEL DOWN button essentially doesn't work. You'd have to push the button over and over and over and wiggle it around before the TV would maybe change a channel. Other buttons are the same way. I'd say about 90% of the buttons work fine. However, I'm sick of having to wiggle buttons around (which is why I am currently surfing Amazon to buy a new remote control). Not sure if the dysfunctional buttons are the case for all the remotes, but the problems are very real on mine. Spend a couple more bucks and get a better remote, in my humble opinion."
1,"used, crappy, and falsely advertised","It was shipped with batteries in it, it was dirty and had something on it, sticky! The buttons were not big, like advertised. and it did not work."
2,Not worth your money!,"The Philips Magnavox name is well-known for good products, but this isn't one of them! The remote is easy to program and the light up feature makes channel surfing in the dark a breeze. However, I have only had my remote for six months and it already doesn't work. I found that the channel +/- keys and volume keys were not responding when I pressed them. I have found that this is a common problem with universal remotes as I have tried three or four different brands. I also have to reprogram the control a lot. For some reason, if it isn't used in a while, it loses the code that was programmed. I also didn't like that the power button was right below the channel down button - I often would turn the TV off by mistake when I just wanted to go back a channel! Spend a little more and order a new remote from the company who made your TV. It will save you a lot of hassle and money in the end!"
3,Decent Light,"Decent light especially for the price. Projects Gobo's fairly well however a the gobo's get a little bit rough around the far edges. Changes Gobo's is a major ordeal and the biggest drawback to this machine. However, for the price versus a high end pro light, it's worth it. Pay $99 or less for it and you're fine, other lights giving similar results (but much easier access) are $350 or more."
1,Here we go again,"Once again, Hollywood has chosen to make an apologia for a degenerate lifestyle. As with River Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon portraying Johnny and June Cash, we are expected to accept drug and alcohol abuse as a natural consequence of ""talent."" Jeff Bridges is an excellent actor and portrays the protagonist perfectly. Problem is, he is fundamentally a dirtbag. In the end, he gets sober. Good for him. Too bad he is about 20 years too late. In any other business other than show business (or perhaps politics) his name would be anathema and he would be lucky to get a job at Mickey D's In show business, his recovery is accompanied by a million dollar income.The movie is well-made, and the acting is superb. However, the message is overwhelmingly depressing and makes this a complete failure for anyone who wants to escape or be uplifted by a movie. For those of you who want to contemplate and dwell upon the sick underbelly of society, this movie is for you."
3,"""that's good, Bad""","My favorite line from this lackluster film, uttered by Jean Craddock, Mad Morris' love interest, well played by Maggie Gyllenhal. Bad Morris, a washed up country singer trying to make a come back is his own worst enemy. When he finally ""hits rock bottom"" and comes to terms with his alcoholism and rover past, it is ""good"", but just a bit too late. Most of the movie portrayed Bad Morris (Jeff Bridges) as an unsavory character--sweaty, profane, chain-smoking and dead drunk; yet there was definitely a spark of humanity in him, which comes to the fore when he becomes interested in the sweet reporter, Jean. I found this film to be quite slow and did not enjoy the character Bad Morris at all, really until the end. The ending wasn't all that bad, and I enjoyed some of the music, especially when he writes some new songs near the end, but overall I have to give the movie a C+."
2,Thank Goodness for Fast Forward,"This was OK at best. There are plenty of good stories that aren't fiction in the country business. They should have just bio'ed a real character, because this was a bit unbelievable. It got very slow in some places too. Jeff Bridges' acting was pretty good, but it seems the academy was in the same mood as some republican conventions and giving things to people who'd payed their dues."
3,I thought this movie was about a wrestler,"I've got no complaints about this movie, other than I'm pretty sure I saw the same exact thing a couple of months ago starring Mickey Rourke. The acting was fine, but the plot was extremely predictable in light of the fact that it's a well-worn story line that offered not a single unexpected twist. I think the Wrestler was a little more compelling, even though I typically would prefer the grizzled musician angle more than the grizzled wrestler angle."
3,Crazy Heart,"How this won an Academy Award is beyond me...it's just OK in every aspect. I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges, but this is not his best work."
3,What Happened To The Ending?,"This movie held my attention right up until the last fifteen minutes or so and then I felt as though the ending was merely ""tacked on"" because there was just no other place to go with the story. I love Jeff Bridges and I think he deserved the Academy Award for his portrayal of Bad Blake, a gifted singer and songwriter who hands his life over to a bottle.The scene in which he is searching frantically for his lady love's little boy is heartwrenching. Listen carefully to Bad Blake's tone; his pleas for help; his heartbreak; the way he says the little boy's name over and over again. This portion of the movie alone is reason for the Oscar.My crazy heart was a hungry heart as the movie ended because I wanted something to hold onto as the closing credits rolled before me. A promise, perhaps? A glimmer of revived love? A slap in the face or a lingering, long overdue kiss; something - anything! Amazing performance. Luke-warm conclusion."
4,Crazy Heart,"I loved the movie in the theatre and felt that this was one movie I wanted to own. I would have liked a little more depth in the ""jacket"" portion (like which stars played which character. However, the movie is great and I recommend this DVD to all."
5,Good Buy,The price was right and the product worked as advertised. I would recommend this product and company
4,Broke after 8 months,"Overall, this is an excellant camera as far as quality of pictures, features, ease of use. I loved it until it just quit taking pictures. After speaking to 3 sony tech support representitives and answering the same questions, they finally came to the conclusion that it was broke. Duh! I didnt drop, mis-use or abuse it. It just quit taking pictures. Sony's 90 day warrenty made matters worse as it will cost $148.00 to fix the camera. I was a big buyer of Sony products until this happened. You would think after spending $289.00 on the camera, it would come with a longer warrenty. Lesson learned! My rating for Sony is a 0 but the camera is a 4 star."
5,Great digital camera for the price,Sony DSC-P31 digital camera is pretty simple to use. It comes with a 8Mb memory stick.I bought a 128Mb memory stick from Sandisk(much cheaper than Sony's memory sticks)and it works fine. Had no problem connecting it to the Computer or TV.The Flash is pretty powerful.I am quite happy that I bought this camera for [the price I paid]. I highly recommend this camera.
2,Not worth the hassle,"Being able to monitor my heart rate without a device strapped on my chest sounded like a great idea......and this device allows you to do that, in theory. I have used both a Polar and Nike heart rate monitor in the past and the only draw back was the chest strap that I always seemed to forget at home. Well, you have no chest strap and you can monitor your heart rate while you exercise, but you have to be able to run/cycle/lift weights while placing your fingers on the 2 sensors on the watch. Quite a feat if you are at the height of your workout and don't want to stop. I found that to be a real pain when all I wanted to do was run/cycle/lift weights and occasionally look at a display to see my heart rate. I bought the device without clearly understanding how it operated."
1,Huge Disappointment,"Sadly, I was suckered into buying a Mio Watch (including the Shape Select Petite) three different times. I had to purchase three because the first two broke and the third one finally broke last week. None of them lasted more than 4 months. And for the rather high price, 4 months is an extrememly short amount of time.While they worked I genuinely enjoyed the product, however their inability to last indicates that the product is not a good one. After happening once, I was willing to give them another try. But after three times, I'm done with all Mio watches.I contacted the company directly about this problem and they never responded. Overall I am very disappointed with Mio watches and the company overall."
4,When it Works it Rocks,"I've had it about 5 months and prefer its design to the earclip. The Pendant does make you look a bit like a 70's love guru and people generally ask what the blinking thing is if you have left it on. The ""answer"" button might be better if located on the earbud. The adapter makes it very versatile - I plug it into my computer at work - I plug it into the TV at home to watch without waking kids, I plug it into iPods. All audio sources from the adapter are automatically muted when a phone call comes in - then it switches back to the audio when the call is completed. Generally it pairs quite fast and I had no trouble pairing it with my phone (Samsung Sync). That said currently I can't get the adapter to sync anymore - the receiver is still synced to the phone but the adapter just flashes mutely. It was very good while it lasted and it lasted longer than an earclip I had - but you would hope to expect more than 5 months use out of an item."
5,Faustian Search for the Truth,"Driven by a Faustian search for the truth Knell has written a passionate, intelligent and honest book. He has done excellentresearch. A good book to have if you are interested in this subject. In his honest approach he comes to the conclusion that many issues still need to be addressed as too much has been misrepresented (e.g.for an excellent misrepresentaion of facts See book by Taylor on Dresden)"
4,Great Buy,This is a great product. the seller is great as well. delivered on time.. came in super condition.. Go Ahead indulge yourself
5,Smashing,"I usualy despise reading, but because I had to do a non-fiction book report in English and I love Led Zeppelin I chose to do this book. I really enjoyed in and I couldn't put it down!"
2,"Not worth $50, not even worth $20","This trimmer is good for LIGHT loads. If you think you are going to use it to trip more than 5 sheets of paper, you are sadly mistaken. I tested the trimming capacity and if you use it to cut even 6 sheets of printer paper the rolling blade goes off its track and slashes up the flimsy, plastic track. I do not recommend this product at all and if you are going to use it for anything other than LIGHT trimming I'd try another product."
2,"Here's Your Sign: Reloaded, Hit and Miss","Bill Engvall provides his usual laugh out loud riffs in this too short CD. His comments about his family life and experiences are just too good to be true. There is quite a bit of recycled material. However, the most jarring moment on this CD is his fellow American bashing on ""Here's Your Sign, Don't Mess With Us"". I found the ""song"" to be a way too political rage/rant on an album that usually finds humor in what we have most in common. Bill, you messed up bigtime here. Thank heavens for the CD burner. I can edit out that ""missing"" moment and enjoy the rest of the material."
1,Whoa whoa whoa...,"I have no agenda - no loyalty to the artist, nor to anyone else trying to ""trash"" this disc. Simply put, I was thoroughly disappointed with this disc. I suppose I needed to read up more on this. I was under the impression that this was a true orchestral recording redone in DTS-ES. It is not. This is somehow synthesized and I enjoyed it so little that I don't really care to know how it was done. All I know is I was really surprised to see that it was so short in length and it sounded like 8-bit sound from a 1990's computer. I was really disappointed. I cannot return it because I opened it, but I am positive I will never play this $22 disc again. Kudos to the artist for doing something creative, but it's not my cup of tea, hence the one star."
2,incorrect sizing description,I liked the dog sweatshirt however it is much smaller than advertized and does not fit my 16LB Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.
4,Good product,"The set so far seems to be great..the real test is will be how well they do on our vacation next week. The only problem is getting the straps inside to hook and stay hooked. Otherwise, great deal for the price."
1,rip off,"I returned the item....I thought it was a rip off....The entire toy, including packaging was worth about $3.00. The advertisement was misleading and you couldn't find cheaper materials used."
4,Dog pouch,"The doggy pouch I ordered actually helps me get my housework done. My puppy is usually following me everywhere and gets under my feet. I was always afraid of stepping on and hurting him. Now, I just put him in the pouch and carry him with me while I do all my household chores. I'm not sure he will fit in the small size much longer, but for now it's awesome!"
4,"Aye-Aye, Sir!! -- Lessons for Us All from ""Canoe U.""","This book can help you in your personal or professional lives by distilling some key lessons of leadership as honed at the US Naval Academy. Leaders are made, not born, and no you can't become a leader by reading a book or a thousand books. But by thoughtfully reading this book and applying its lessons, you WILL improve your leadership skills. The Navy has 4 short years to turn recent high school graduates into combat leaders. Their formula has, by and large, worked for them. Put it to work for you...."
3,Good product but not for clothing...,"Overall the quality of the star shape and felt we're good. Unfortunately, I bought these to put on a shirt for my son to wear to his 100th day celebration and they did not adhere as well as I would have liked to the cloth. He came home with about 25 stars left on the shirt. I don't think they were meant for this kind of use so that should not count against the product, however I also found removing the backing from some of the stars very difficult in the process of using them which could use improvement."
3,Some Good Features,"I've used the Mavica 7 and 75 for years in my work (real estate). The features most useful were Zoom (10x optical), aperture (1.8 would do low light pictures) and the floppy disk convenience. The major draw back for me was poor printed photos. I thought the 200 was an opportunity to keep the good features and correct the poor resolution and add the alternate storage capability etc. I am not sure why but Sony reduced the zoom to 3x and changed the aperture. Unfortunately I'm returning my 200."
5,the descriptive language in this book is most enjoyable,I did not want this book to endMy sister saw my face as I finished the book and she had to have it!!I have given it as a gift!! The best!! Want to read the sequel.
5,"An amazing love story, ""a sudden glory.""","This book tells of a love that few of us have experienced. It's one of the best love stories ever told, along with a treasured friendship with C.S Lewis. Through the author's ""grief"" we might all learn the feeling of what it's like to lose our one true love (but only on this Earth)> A simply brilliant piece, I recommend it to anyone who questions whether or not God exists, or whether or not pure love can endure."
2,Somewhat sensational hype of popular subject,"Roeper tracks down a number of ""urban legends,"" but fails to explain that the term ""urban legend"" was developed by folklorists (not movie scriptwriters) and is actually an important way to learn about contemporary beliefs and attitudes. He should read at least one of Jan Brunvand's books!"
3,Organizational Psychology,"This book is not as helpful as I had hoped. It contains much information, but the layout is not conducive to skimming and accelerated look-up of information."
4,The Sure Thing,"Like the best teen movies, So Lyrical is entertaining, funny, and not always tethered to mundane realism. Cook's engaging plot kept me turning pages, and she has a keen ear for the way teen girls talk to each other. So Lyrical isn't just about secret admirers and groupie moms; it's a lighthearted look at the often heartbreaking process of becoming an adult, of measuring yourself against your parents and your friends and struggling to make important decisions that reflect who you are even while not being completely sure of who you are. I always find that weighty stuff like that goes down a lot easier when it's wrapped in something like this delightful confection of a novel. If you're in search of a gloomy look at the horrors of adolescence, you've got plenty of choices; if you are looking for a fun, easy read that also happens to be packed with emotional truth, pick up So Lyrical."
4,Nice for students of Medieval Europe,"Good book with simple maps, black, white and green and not poor texts. Detailed. But unfortunately, mostly focuses on European history. I' d call it Atlas of Medieval Europe."
1,No reason to shop for this.,"You buy a movie for some reason; it is funny, sexy, dramatic, sad, or perhaps a documentary. I(foolishly) bought this thinking it would be harmless fun, a 1960's type of romp. Well, it wasn't funny, cute, dramatic, tragic, or anything. The true story that this is 'based' on was not in any way reflected here, not that that matters. In the end, the director must have just decided to get something 'in the can' and ship it out as a finished movie."
2,Not as good as the other brand,"I have used the other brand offered by Amazon on many occasions in the past, but purchased the Grabber Toe Warmer because I wanted a smaller box (fewer warmers) to get me to the end of the ski season. Unfortunately, the adhesive doesn't hold very well (usually comes unstuck when I try to put my boot on), and the warmer doesn't stay as warm as long as the other brand."
1,OVERPRICED-DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I PAID $6.82 FOR THIS PIECE OF CRAP. LIST PRICE $76 FOR ONE PAIR OF TOE WARMER????????? DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT. IT'S ONLY $0.50 AT THE STORE NOT $6.82.....
3,Broken Spine,"I love the content of the book and the work of Alex Ross, but I am on my second paperback edition. The spine came away from the book for the second time. This time was past Barnes and Noble's return time. Do not buy the paperback edition.Art Teacher"
5,Best DBZ ever!,"my god, now one has reviewed this yet. it's the best! it's so fun flying around the planet. the game is way longer than the last 2. new characters include uub, broly, cooler, omega shenron, kid goku, and u can finally go SS4! even powering up looks sweet. transformations have more detail, and you can fly at any time you want! got this the first day. if u like the first 2, this one is better than both 1 and 2 combined and then a lot more."
3,It was okay,Didnt love the magazine as I was hoping I would. Not so applicable to us... We do small scale gardening and chicken raising. Will try a different mag now
1,Poor follow-up,"After simultaneously finding their first album ""Automatic Man"" on CD, I was really curious to hear the follow-up.....an album I have NEVER heard before. I got the first album back in 1976, and it is one of THE MOST innovative progressive rock/fusion recordings ever....even the cover art was unlike anything else.By comparison, this is a POOR showing. To my ears, there wasn't even one stand out track. The entire ""sound"" of the recording is different from their first outing, and although there are new bass player and drummer added to the new lineup, the most outstanding elements of the first album, Bayete's writing/singing/keyboards, and Pat Thrall's ultra-hot guitar licks just aren't there on this recording!Not sure WHAT happened here, but it just DOES NOT work! As much as I liked the first album(5 stars) I had to give this stinkera single star :-("
4,Pleasant noise reduction,"These are so much nicer than regular triple-flange earplugs. (Which I use all the time at work.)I haven't been to a concert with these yet, but mowing the lawn is much more pleasant when you hear all things simply ""turned down."" That as opposed to having some sounds muffled in a frustrating way that makes you want to take your earplugs out to be able to hear better.The paper that comes with these describes how the company's noise reduction rating is higher (around the same as most earplugs) than the OSHA ""official"" testing that they have printed and advertised. I believe they are right. Getting the plugs in up to the third flange reduces the noise just as much as my ""plain"" earplugs. It just takes a little wiggling to get them into a comfortable position, as they have a hard plastic section where you grab them."
5,Very nice ear plugs,"These are very nice for listening to music. You hear everything, it's just more quiet. They're not for extremely loud environments and they're not for maximal noise reduction but they're very nice for listening to music that's too loud."
5,tokyo bound,very possibly the best kung-fu porn book i have ever read! they should definitely make a movie out of it.
3,Wasn't the information I'd hoped for,I was looking specifically for information on the talismans from the key of Solomon. This book did not have the information I was looking for.
4,Financial Thriller,I normally read political biographies and political fiction. I picked up this book and found it hard to put down. The author displays deep insight into the world of Wall Street. Living in New York I enjoyed the familiarity of recognizing areas that I walk in and one of my children lives in. A riveting book.
5,Full of Surprises,"That's exactly what this book is: full of surprises. Searching for his and Ce'Nedra's son, (Bel)Garion and the people travelling with him find themselves in Cthol Murgos.The story has some very funny twists and turns that you could never expect. It had me laughing at points, some of it was so funny. Don't mistake me, the book has some very serious and sad parts, but when...I'm not telling you. It would ruin the surprise. You'll have to find out yourself.But I'll warn you, Garion meets some very odd people while travelling. He ends up having friends in the oddest places, literally. So if you like a book with a completely new story line, you should read this one. I'm sure you'll like it."
5,A great read!,"I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling to resolve the issues of science and spirituality. The author's writing style creates a book that is easy to read, captivating, yet very thorough and logical.Even if you're not a Muslim, this book is well worth reading. Knowledge of the Koran is not needed to understand the author's points."
2,Poor Durability,Great picture for daytime sports. Poor pixilation for night time movie scenes. Screen failed after 3 years of very light use with vertical black lines running from mid-screen to bottom that ruin the picture. Not recommended for durability reasons.
2,Not enough for the price,"I was very disappointed in this product, and returned it. Thekeyboard you had to poke at, was very cumbersome. Also, the organizerwas poorly laid out. It was almost unusable. I had to remove the software to sync-up my pager. The Palm III was only $30 more, and does tons more."
4,better world books,"The book was in great condition! I chose expedited shipping but it still took me a week to get the book! When I finally got it I saw why :(Anyway apart from the shipping misleading, I would still purchase from these. Just don't bother paying expedited!"
3,Disappointed with actual condition as compared to description,"The book's description in the condition space said, ""very good,"" when in fact, the pages seem steamed or as if they were wet and then dried? Where condition is, ""good"" would've been a more correct description for the book."
3,Simple Design but problems with DVD's can be fixed,"I have only used this product for a short time, but was irritated by the fact that it does not play many DVD's straight from the box. The ""not formatted for this region"" problem can be fixed by calling the service number for zenith products on the back of the owners manual. The problem is a simple setting that the manual doesn't cover. It took only a minute to fix once connected with the help people. After the fix, the product works great, but I must give rating of 3 because of the DVD screw up. Otherwise I would give the product a 4 or 5 for ease of setup and use and it performs the way I'd expect a lower cost unit to perform. If it doesn't play some DVD's, call the number!"
3,Metaphysics of dreaming,"Through a series of 12 lessons (chapters) Michael Bertiaux, in occult circles better known as Master Aquarius, leads you through a system of metaphysics, culminating in a series of simple meditation exercises designed to induce the lucid dreaming and contact with the inhabitants of the ""inner worlds"". It's simple, clear and enchanting... Meditation exercises are borrowed from the tradition of Tibetan Bon-po and can be a true door to inner worlds. Very interesting for those who want to study Bertiaux's occult system."
2,"Easy to assemble, poor paint finish","This scaffolding unit was easy to assemble and can be set to different height levels. We use it on our warehouse when we need to reach the taller part of a wall or shelf.One problem with the unit is its poor paint finish. Even though it was stored indoors on a relatively dry location, large sections developed rust after only 4 months. We contacted the manufacturer but they only provide a warranty for the first 90 days and showed no regard for our concern. Their customer service deserves a negative rating. Make sure you check the unit carefully before the 90 days are up."
5,Good Scaffolding,This scaffolding works great. It can be used on stairwells with the bucks set to different levels.
5,Nostalgic and Beautiful,"Destroyer's Rubies got a lot of attention in 2006, and deservedly so, but I found it somewhat inconsistent: the last few songs on that album were just missing the magic of the first part. But that same kind of magic fills every track on this earlier record.Your Blues is filled with wonderful bits of melody, great singing, and fantastic lyrics (hey, it's Destroyer - what did you expect?), but the aspect of this music that continually impresses me is the instrumentation. The use of midi-sounding horns and keyboards creates a sad and moving kind of 80s nostalgia. Highlights include The Music Lovers and the title track. Highly recommended"
5,Fabulous album,"I was hanging out in the local coffee shop the other day when this album was playing. I found myself fascinated by the unique style of the music and the absolutely crazy lyrics. I ordered this album a few days later and I'm totally obsessed with it! I've since ordered Destroyer's Rubies and This Night and they're pretty good too - but they don't seem to flow as smoothly as this album does. It's the best introduction to Destroyer in my opinion.Only song that I don't really care for on this album is the Fox and the Hound. Other than that - wow. Personal favorites are Actors revenge, The Music Lovers and Certain Things you ought to know.For me, this is THE defining Indie group."
3,An ok machine,"This body flex was pretty easy and straightforward for me to put together (took about 45 minutes). There are loop holes that stick out near the bottom to attach your resistance bands. I have a few resistance bands that work great with the system. The main issue I have with the system is how awkward it is to use. If I place my feet on the metal platform, when I kick back my lifting leg hits the bar its lifting. I have to stand a little to the side to make it work, which results in a slightly controlled tipping of the system. Pretty much doing any of the moves is a little awkward, but that may also be because the system isn't very stable. It would probably work better if the system was more solid. All in all it works pretty decently, but I plan to invest in another system, probably something with a bench."
2,Singers beware,"Jerome Hines had a long and distinguished operatic career, but he has perhaps thought too much about technical matters for his own and other singers' good. His explanations are confusing, on occasion self-contradictory, and in some cases read like an invitation to vocal abuse -- e.g., vocalizing throughout the range on an unmodified 'ee' vowel. It is hard to escape the suspicion that Mr. Hines was able to prosper because of an exceptionally strong physical constitution and set of cords. I think that most students attempting what he recommends would be in big vocal trouble fast.The book was chiefly interesting for its recollections of performances and colleagues from Mr. Hines' past; but even here there is so much talk of vocal trauma, singing through laryngitis, and ruptured vessels that reading made me, as a serious amateur singer, so queasy I had to put the book down.I think aspiring singers would be much better off imitating Bjoerling records than reading this book."
4,Truth on False Start,"False Start: How The New Browns Were Set Up To FailTerry Pluto explained what all us loyal Browns fans have known - just needed someone with clout to expose the truth. What a costly mistake to Cleveland - a huge city with a reputation at stake! What a clear example of the heartlessness and greed Art Modell was really made of! Giving us underhanded crap to a town that had fans many other pro-teams were jealous of. The fans need to 'own' the Cleveland Browns as we're the ones who would find the heart and soul in administration and coaches - ones that we can trust. I feel for the guys who are playing for the Browns as they need winning leadership to rise out of the ashes that Modell left behind. Time to clean up and stop messin' around!Elaine W, OhioLifetime fan"
4,Still valuable after many years,"Still one of the best books of this kind, but new trends of IB in recent years should be updated in future upcoming edition."
1,ACDelco 540-74 Shock Absorber,"ACDelco 540-74 Shock Absorber do not come with upper busing/absorber, nor washer, nor nut. You need to purchase these items from a dealer."
1,DVD problems,"I just picked up this unit for a 5.1 surround sound system in my bedroom.The stereo, and VHS work great, but the DVD player is useless. The unit plays audio CD's just fine, (both regular CD's and burned MP3 discs) but everytime I insert a DVD movie, it attempts to read for two or three minutes, then gives me a DISC ERR message. This phenomenon happens 100% of the time, regardless of the movie I insert. (I've tried several retail DVD's and a few burned DVD's)Luckily I only purchased this setup 2 days ago, so it's going back! I wish I had read the other review of this product documenting the same problem, and had heeded their warning."
1,Unusable,"The reading bar is very hard to move up and down, which as far as I'm concerned, makes the product worthless. I tried WD40, but it's just poorly designed. And now I can't return it.Corporate garbage."
5,Glad I bought it,"Great graphic for a Xbox1 gamegood game-play, nice pacingthis a well designed gameI gave this a 3 for fun because the over all game lacked a certain ""Ommff"" of...I'm owning it up an big Mech"
3,Good workout,This is a video I did at least 10 years ago and remember it being an accessible routine and a challenge. There are interesting body conditioning cycles here that you don't need to be an expert to do. Really enjoyed it then but unfortunately now have to find a more challenging routine to accompany my time at the gym.
2,Good for beginners,This is a really easy workout for beginners. Not terribly challenging but a good place to start off.
1,Kindle users beware: really bad formatting. Book itself is great,"Little Red Hen really, really disappointed me in the Kindle version. It's garbled and all mis-formatted, and absolutely unreadable. I am doubly disappointed by this, because the formatting for Galbadon's Three Little Kittens is perfect - so the publisher is obviously aware of how to format a Kindle book but chose not to do so correctly in this case. From what I can make out, it appears that the physical book is very nicely done. I just wish we could see it without having to pay for the same thing twice. I have deleted and re-downloaded numerous times to ensure it wasn't a mechanical error, to no avail. Bottom line: if you want this book, and it does appear to be worth a spot in the kiddie library, don't bother with the digital verson."
3,dropped,"The entire book is classic Francis - what I love and expect and wait to read. However, the ending was so aburpt that I thought perhaps Kindle was only giving me 95% and leaving out the last chapter. Instead of that wonderful feeling of having met a new friend, and having consumed a wonderful tasty treat, I was left bewildered and feeling cheated. How hard would it have been to tidy up the ending?"
2,Chip easily!,"I got these dishes 6 years ago for my wedding and they started chipping within the first month we had them. Now, 6 years later, every last plate and bowl has a chip(s) on it. They are far too fragile for every day use and I wish I hadn't gotten them. Replacing them this week with Fiesta ware."
5,Un Ska Sabroson,"Muy buen disco de Inspector, es una super buena banda, este material es increible, recomiendo Amargo Adios y Amnesia (con Café tacuba y maldita vecindad)."
3,wish i could read this!!!!!,"great book wish the type was big enough for people over 45 years could read.i returned it becuse it hurt my eyes to work so hard, come on guys spend a little more cash and make the print bigger not just your pockets"
4,It's harder than it looks,"My family just finished this puzzle and it's more challenging than it looks. The shapes of the pieces are fairly conventional, so it's not that easy to pick one out from a similar piece. The puzzle itself has a large dark area in the center, which I guarantee will be the last thing you complete. Make sure you put this together under a strong light, so you can more easily identify subtle patterns. Worth the money."
3,"Great guy, deserves a better book","I've read way too many space books, so I love the subject matter, but the style of this one was too breezy, lacking in important detail. Each chapter is about 12 words long, so you get the impression this was either rushed through or intended for young adults. I learned little about the man, whom I wholly admire. Did he alienate anybody? Were there any character flaws? Also, I was looking to learn more of an insider's view of Gemini and Apollo, but it was all very superficial, heard-it-before material. I'd read a bit about Conrad, like his attempt to smuggle onto the moon a huge cowboy hat to fit over his space helmet, or his attempt at trick photography on the lunar surface, hoping to befuddle the photo analysts later. Neither of these gems were in the book. He's a great guy, a pilot's pilot, a problem-solving magician with a live-for-the-moment spirit. But the book is really junk food, even for a space nut like myself. Sorry, Pete. They done ya wrong."
4,Succeed on a literary level but there's some historical fiction in there.,"I really enjoyed the book and it ""fit"" with what I know about Conrad from reading other works about his years in the space program. I did find the ""voice"" of the book to be a little off as the authors told a lot of stories from Pete's point of view, and not all of that can be authentic....for instance, even at the end, there is the story of his last motorcycle ride, including an encounter with a little girl in a diner who gets his autograph, and we are told what he was thinking/feeling as he left the restaurant before his fatal crash. I am not sure how anyone could know that, but it made a really good story. In any case, this is a very enjoyable read, and I do think the personality of the man comes through, but if you are after absolute historical accurary, be on your guard."
4,Feast for Richard Boone fans,"Three Bells for Perdido was the first episode of the classic TV western, Have Gun, Will Travel. It set the stage for the episodes that followed and introduced us to the central character--Paladin. Well acted, taunt and authentic, a feast for those of us who love westerns. Watch for Jack Lord in his pre-Hawaii Five-O days as the villian. While not the BEST episode that the show produced, this episode also did not get lost in introducing the character and setting of the series."
4,helpful information but most I was aware of,"This is a well written book. Primarily, it is written for those who do not already have a keen awareness of personality types and how to address them in differing situations. It is an older write but completely relevant. Business leaders, those who have a plurality of direct reports, may benefit greatly from a solid read coupled with immediate application."
3,blah..,"An okay album if you dig that whole psychodelic-funk-ska thing. (never heard of it? me neither). It has a couple of good songs such as ""Drakool"" and ""Matar"" but the rest of the album leaves me with a headache."
3,Not history....this work is editing.,"Stacey Schiff, from a decidedly secular and anti-God perspective responds to the damage done to Franklins' legend in the Pulitzer Prize winning work, ""John Adams"" by David McCullough. The only problem is...she fails."
2,Hard to Listen to on Audio Book,This book was hard to listen to because it is hard to follow. It doesn't keep me interested enough to want to listen to the next disc. Very disappointed.
4,gore galore! I'm lovin it.,I love this movie. it came undamaged and is an excellent addition to any werewolf movie collection. I can't wait to get the other two movies from this series!
4,Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed,"This is the weakest of the 3 GS movies that I've seen. The performance of the actress portraying the character Ghost is to me the most memorable thing about this film. Still while not the best in the series it is far better than most werewolf movies available. With adult themes visualized, this is not a movie I would recommended for childrens viewing."
2,boring but informative,"I am still plowing through this history of John Jacob Astor. I believe this was written in the '30's, and the language is very formal and hard to follow sometimes. Focuses a lot on Astor's trade practices and it gets really boring in the middle. The first chapter was the best and traced him from Germany to England and then to America. The author seems to have a slightly negative feeling towards his subject---calling him unimaginative and dull. I felt like I got the gist of his wealth in one chapter----the man got rich off of furs by forming a monopoly. It was interesting to know that the famous Astors became so rich and became leading members of New York society all because the original heir was a determined beaver trapper and tradesman."
4,Techno-Pop Bee Gees,"In the early 1980's, when the Bee Gees were writing and producing for the likes of Barbara Streisand, Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross and Dionne Warwick, they were also putting out solo albums. This short collection is techno-pop at its most urgent. Maurice Gibb backs brother Robin with nearly every instrument played on synthesized keyboards, save a few guitar licks. Its simple, deliberate and ultimately, `Gibb-catchy'. The album received little fanfare, but the single, ""Boys Do Fall In Love"" was a huge dance hit, extracting an extended version. The other single released (also extended) was the title track, which is an awkward, stumbling exercise in pop excess. It's just silly. However, some of the experimental work done on these tracks show that the Gibb twins were not only amazing pop song writers, but had mastered the technical aspects of modern music. The unnoticed and rare follow-up, ""Walls Have Eyes"" is a brilliant extension of this album."
2,AHHHHHHHHHH MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!,"i should have reviewed last year. over the simmer i got a sudden and short intrest in duel masters. this game is ok. the monsters look supprisingly good for such an old title. i like the fact that you buy booster packs to get cards. a cheat code i forgot gives you 4 of every card. including the element shard cards figure it out. the main flaw in the game is the music!! i mean i know that the japanese, as smart as they are dont listen to this shhhhhhhhh all day long. the music from the shows inuyasha or even teen titans is better!!!!"
1,SAP Authorization System,"You put together a team of 8 people from IBM, 1 Doctor among them, to produce a book with no specific details that explain in detail, as expected, and after reading the table of contents, how to do the work with sufficient screen shots, step by step actions, etc.This is an IBM best practives generic guideline, not an SAP in detail book.An article from the SAP Professional Journal about the matter, has more contents than this book.I do not recommend it, unless you are a project manager, and want to have a brush up of what SAP security is all about.I apologize for the comment, but I expected more from IBM and SAP, as well."
1,Easier stuff out there,"I agree with the reviewer below who said she found moneypants.com to be easier and better. Quicken is soooo complicated, I got a headache before I could upload any infomration and I lost my motivation before i even started. The MoneyPants site is definitely better for someone like me who needs help getting motivated to do this stuff in the first place!"
2,Very confusing interface,"Well I got the letter from Intuit with the mandate I upgrade to 2005 or else...I admit I only use Quicken for basic bill pay and account management, but I just cant believe how cluttered the interface is in 05. They have child windows for everything and lots of garbage on the screens that I find distracting.On the plus side the upgrade did go well. All of the accounts and transactions got carried over fine."
1,How could they have got it so wrong?,It has been said before I arrived and the reviews are quite accurate; this is perhaps the worst I have ever seen from a company that wrote the book on money management applications.
1,Don't buy this product,"I have used quicken since the DOS version. I'm just upgrading from Quicken 1998 to the 2005 version. I am SO disappointed in this product, mostly because they are now attempting to make additional money by (1) charging an additional fee for functions that were previously supported in the standard version of the product, and (2) charging banks to allow downloading of transactions into Quicken. My bank is no longer supported by this tool. I want my money back so I can purchase Microsoft Money which is far less expensive anyway!"
1,Q05 breaks 401(k) accounts,"Quicken 2005 seems to have no major additions, just a few new bugs added. Of course, they don't actually have to offer new functionality -- they just ""sunset"" a bunch of Quicken versions (Q01, Q02) to force people to upgrade.... So far, so bad...What is really a big nuisance is how 401(k) handled, though. Instead of the wizrd screen which creates the right set of buy transactions at the average price, they now put ""placeholder transactions"" which don't reflect the money coming from the account, etc.I would love to switch to downloaded data, BUT --- doing so requires me to first put sell on all my current funds, and then do a buy-back with a new fund name (Quicken insists on creatong new names for the downloaded data!), losing all my history.Summary: stay away from Q05 if you need to do anything with 401k accounts"
3,Functions work but import limitations,"The most frustrating aspect of Quicken is that when you upgrade it destroys all your detail. I lost a lot of work because of that. I've never really recovered from having over 1 year worth of detail lost. There was no warning when I upgraded and couldn't get back the detail.The functions are work but my bank offers csv format. It can imported into a worksheet and saved as an excel file. However I couldn't find a way to import that data. I also used Versacheck and couldn't import that data either. These are major problems, even if you are a loyal customer who upgrades regularly."
1,Bad program continues to deteriorate,"As if the recent decline in the once proud Quicken isn't enough, now it's NO GO WITH QIF files... it seems they want only one proprietary format that others will have to pay them to use...Couple that with abysmal support, and even MS Money is looking better than Quicken 2005...Developers, the time is ripe indeed for a better program!"
2,Not a good deal,"They are too small and flimsy, they look nice though. One of the plates was already off the jar when they came in. don't waste your money!"
2,Not really what I was expecting,"I was looking for a more concrete business book but instead this book gives ideas which I had already come up with. Most of the suggestions where surface based... expos, coffee shops, not a ton of speaking from more of a business sense."
2,A deception,"If one is trying to learn more about Tarot as a self understanding tool, this book is not for you. Too materialist. It try to teaches to make money from Tarot but even this is not well done."
5,Indispensible Tool for Any Professional Practitioner,"Professional Tarot by Christine Jette is the one book I referred to most often as I was creating both my on-line and live classes and seminars -- in palmistry.She covers all the key information you need to know to build your spiritual, alternative, metaphysical or related business. From marketing tips to dealing with unsavory clients - she's got your back.What was of particular interest to me was the meticulous way she lays out seminar topics and advanced classes.Even though I only dabble in Tarot for my own experience, I do teach palmistry. Having this book at my desk while I was creating my first curriculum was priceless!A must have for anyone ready to start making money with their skills in esoteric or mystical practices."
4,Not a Dog in these Catastrophes,"Great Book, thoughtful and somewhat idiosyncratic analysis of how we should think about and respond to low probability but very large consequence events.Works very well paired up with Robert Shillers book ""Macro Markets"""
5,THIS IS THE GREAT LOST SOUL ALBUM OF THE 70's,"So....put your laughter aside. Yes ""Ring My Bell"" is perhaps the classic one-hit wonder, but this album is incredible! Subtract ""Ring"" and a song called ""Make Believe Lovers"" and you're left with an incredible seventies soul album. Ward has a very high-pitched voice -- somewhere in the Deniece Williams/Minnie Riperton world -- but the songs on this album could have been on a great Gladys Knight album they are that good. ""You Lied"" and the killer ""I Won't Stop Loving You"" are true classics. Order this -- you will not regret it."
3,La fea mas bella dvd,"Every thing was great until I realized each dvd had a 2nd side. (I was only watching the first side of each of the 4 dvds.) Then I discovered that there is a shadow like a water spot on side 2 of dvd 1 and it does not play well, like it breaks up and then stops altogether. I suppose it is too late to get a new dvd. I haven't watched side 4 or 6 yet.Carol"
1,Damaged goods,"I was disappointed with this product because the two that I received, in which one was sent back, did not work. It may be the problem of the packaging company, I'm not sure but all I know is the product (both of them) did not work."
1,disappointed,"I loved the novela when I watched it on TV and so I was excited when it finally came out on DVD. I was very disappointed when I watched it, however. Much of the humor and character development has been cut out. It's not really worth watching on DVD."
3,La Fea Mas Bella,"I am glad that the video came out. I have missed watching it. This is my first Amazon purchase. I wish I had known that not all the episodes are included. I don't like that there are some fun things missing. There are episodes that were favorites for me that are missing. Will there be a video set II? I also had to send my original set back. It had chips and stains on the DVDs. I could not watch it on the television or computer. The second set, sent quickly, had stains on it too. It plays better but it too has problems. I did not wish to send it back again. I am a bit disappointed with the problems on the DVDs but glad I have it. Next time I guess I will go to the store."
3,just okay,"not exactly what i was expecting - but not sure what i was expecting. Also didn't read description well enough and it was a VHS tape, not a DVD."
2,"Okay, but not great",This video is okay. The only thing it has going for it is that it doesn't have a lot of competition. It isn't something you can watch and workout to. There are a lot of weird shots that seem to distract from the art.
1,too basic,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. The moves they teach, as few as they were,my grandmother could perform. You require no coordination at all. The majority of this DVD was was filled with testimonials from the students that said how great the DVD was and how sexy they felt. It isn't even worth considering."
4,Great Collection,"This contains all of their old videos, including a few I'd never seen. They are dated, but some of them really brought back memories. Sound quality is definitely better than the video production. The live concert is good, but I don't think it was one of their best.In any case, if you are a fan, it's well worth it."
2,Buggy to the end,"This player demonstrated software bugs through its life, often refusing to transfer files to and from the player. Now, only 2 years after purchase, it has reverted to booting up to recovery mode only. Contacts with Creative customer service inform me that since it is out of warranty, I can pay them $28/hr to communicate with me on the issue with no guarantee that they'll actually fix it. Of course, long distance charges may apply. No thanks."
4,"So far, so good","I was a little nervous about purchasing this item since I have heard some bad things about the headphone jack but I wanted a MP3 player with a large memory that also had a removeable/replaceable battery. This is the only one that exists. A replacement battery is relatively inexpensive, cheaper than having to send an i-pod in to get the battery replaced. It's not a fancy player but it's fairly easy to use. Mine has been to Ireland and back and has taken some abuse and works great. I also heard that the battery pops out easily but I always keep mine in the carrying case that came with it and I haven't had any problems. I highly recommend this player."
3,"Response to Mills from Canton, MA","This is a pretty good mp3 player. The iPod is much better. However, this review is a response to Mills, who said ""With the Nomad, you can put any music in any kind of form on it, while on an Ipod, you can only put the music you download for 99 cents from Itunes on it."" You are WRONG. I own an iPod, and you can play any music in any kind of form as well, the 99 cents for itunes is just one more option. In fact, it is a very good option, because it is almost perfect sound quality in a legal song for 99 cents, rather than paying $16 for a cd with only a few songs you want, or downloading a crappy quality song (which is illegal anyways) on KaZaA. So in fact, not only can the iPod play all the types of music that the Creative Labs Zen can play (they can both play all mp3s, wavs, aiffs, etc), but it can play songs downloaded from iTunes which the Zen CANNOT do."
3,"Great when it works, but fragile",Excellent features and performance and especially worthwhile if you need the 60 GB disk. But it broke after falling 18 inches to a tile floor. This just doesn't cut it for me.
2,Not user friendly interface,"Totally disappointed in the product usability, even simple MP3 players from 3 years ago much better. All operation of this MP3 relies on visual unfriendly menu. The submenu choosing button impossible to convenient control. No lock button, just software lock, software control over speed and pitch. All functioning based on choosing from a menu on the screen. Visually impaired check well in a store before you buy it. The navigation inside menu can't be learned buy hurt , too complicate, the mp3 is not recognized as a hard disk devise in your PC so you need to transfer files using the creative software which is not simple and has a problem to work with ""jaws"". No speaking menu exists for this devise."
5,Every baby needs this...lots of fun!,"This is the greatest entertainer/bouncer for babies. We had the original jumperoo for our son and he just loved it, even without all the cool toys. So, when we saw this new and improved version, we knew we had to get it for our 5 month old daughter. She absolutely loves this! She starts to get all excited and her legs get kicking before she is even in the seat all the way. Once in, she jumps and plays and has a wonderful time. Our daughter even enjoys the old jumperoo that now is at grandma's house!"
4,The babe loves it!,This jumperoo is great! Our daughter loves it! My only complaint is that I wish it went one notch lower. I had to put a blanket below her so she could touch. Otherwise it's all good; really easy to put together and clean.
5,Great!,"Purchased for your 9 month old daughter for christmas. She loves the sounds and the bouncing. She also has an exersaucer at my mom's but prefers the bouncer. At first she could only reach with her toes, but she's very short and we have had that problem with a few things.It's very sturdy and I would highly recommend this bouncer!"
4,My son loves it,"I have an average size six month old with a lot of energy, and he loves this toy. He jumps and loves to try to grab the toys that hang down. He is colorful and he likes the sounds, which I think are the perfect volume, not too loud.I do wish it stored away easier. It does take up a bit too much space.Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo"
5,Worth the Money!,I bought the jumperoo because grandma has a staionary entainer. SO I wanted something different. Even at the store the baby prefered this jumperoo. Its great because the seat turns 160 degrees and its got great toys that the baby loves. The only downfall to this jumperoo is it doesn't go high enough. I have a 6 month old that weighs almost 20 lbs. For a big baby that isn't mobile they won't get use out of it for long so I wish we would have bought it sooner. But needless to say it is still worth the money. The baby loves it and will jump for a long time...long enough for me to get dinner made. If you are in the market for a jumperoo I would get this one!
5,Most useful and enjoyable baby investment,This has been the best toy/ activity center my son could have. He is now six months old and he has been playing on it for little more than 2 months. He keeps finding new ways to play with its toys and is occupied most of the time. Right now he is in the jumping mode and jumps for more than 15 minutes continuously. We have it our kitchen/dinning room and I am able to get my work done/ eat lunch and dinner while he jumps on it. Usually my son does not play for more than 10 mins without me by his side but the jumperoo really helps keep him busy. I am sure most parents will identify with that.We have tried the excersaucer at our friends place and my son got bored with it within five minutes. So we are really glad we went with this product. Also gives him a good workout.
5,Many months of fun!,"We bought this jumperoo for our son when he was 2 months old. He is now 8 months old and still loves it. Each month he has discovered something new. The Jumperoo has several levels, so when he outgrew level one, we moved it up to level three. At first, we had to put a pillow on the floor so he could reach. The only concern I have with this toy is when he was just 2 months old, and wasn't holding his head up as well, he would sometimes bang his head forward on the seat-and there is not much padding. Therefore, it's best to wait until baby is holding head up well or add some extra padding to the front of the seat. We also have a door jumper, but we trust this one more. A great buy! A great toy!"
4,Fun and interesting for baby,This jumperoo matches my mobile. Since Zoe liked the mobile so much I thought she might have a appreciation for this item. She does. In fact she stares at the frog and bird which are identical to the ones on the mobile. We currently put a book under the jumperoo so that her feet can reach but she likes to kick. She enjoys the music and seems interested in all of the toys. This item takes up a great of room and I was expecting some of the toys to be a bit more creative but it's still a hit.
2,not so sturdy,Purchased this jumper for my grandson a couple of months ago. It seemed perfect. It is bright and colorful. He immediately seemed to know how to jump and would be delighted by the activity. It became a favorite spot of his and gave a much needed safe location while my daughter cooked or got a few chores done. However the long spring on the support leg broke and the company advised there are not replacement parts available. Very disappointing but they have offered a refund after the broken leg is returned. That should prove interesting as it is an odd shape. He is well within the weight limit and not walking yet. Not sure if I will replace it with another.
5,Baby loves it,"Baby loves this jumperoo. The only thing that I don't like is the weight limit of 25lbs, which is not so great for bigger babies."
5,One of the best purchases we have made for our baby!,"We absolutely love this jumperoo! I must admit, as first time parents, my husband and I were skeptical before we purchased this as to whether our son would actually use this, however our skepticism quickly disappeared as our 8-month old has used this everyday and loves it!He was four months old when we first started putting him in it and although he could not jump, the toys along the sides were great for stimulation. The swivel seat is great too as baby grows, they can begin to explore all of the toys on their own.Once our son learned to jump, he didn't want to get out of it. I also believe that because of this jumperoo, he has built up a ton of length strength and it is helping advance his crawling and standing skills.I would highly recommend this product!"
2,Not for my baby,"I bought this for my daughter because she loves to jump in her exersaucer and I thought she'd really like this. At first, she was really interested in the toys, but after we put her in there she hated it. We tried for a while and everytime we put her in the jumper she screamed. Like another reviewer commented I think it's meant for taller babies. My daughter was 6 months when we got it and average size. She was able to jump, but just sort of hung there at rest and looked very uncomfortable. Cute toys, but my baby just didn't like it."
5,Awesome!!,I got this jumper for my son when he was about 5 months old.. he is now about to be 10 months and he still loves it!! I has so many toys and the music is awesome!! He likes getting the little bird and frog that are at the top hanging!! I would so recommend this to anyone who is looking for a jumper!!
5,Awesome !,"My son just loves this toy/play area. I got it put together and put him in there and he just went crazy! He loves to sit in there and play, especially when gets bored on being in Mom or Dad's lap. It gives Mom a chance to get things done while he is awake (and Dad a chance to help her!). We love it, I just wish we would have bought it sooner!"
4,FP Rainforest jumperoo,"This is perfect for the child who tries to stand early! My grandson can happily spend 20 minute intervals in this (and once fell asleep in it!). One might need to put a blanket or step stool under the child's feet as the smaller children can't reach the floor, even when the jumperoo is set in the lowest setting."
5,Awesome jumperoo,We got this jumperoo a couple of days back..my lil one is so loving it..Its cute looking and has lot of things to explore for the lil ones..definetely buy this..
1,product parts were dumped in a box and some parts were damaged,"i was upset to receive it in a plain box instead of the product box. Also, the parts were just thrown into the box and there were some dirts on the product, so i was like is this floor model or used or returned item?? I was still trying to put the product together and sure enough one of the parts were broken in half. amazon has a good return service, but it's a big box that I have to drop off, and I'm just getting refund instead of exchange and I won't order this one from amazon."
5,So much fun!,"My son loved this and would just have a ball bouncing around, and seemingly dancing along to the songs. Once he really started to crawl he wasn't interested in it anymore but that's pretty normal for any child because they want to be on the move."
5,Great Entertainment,I bought the jumperoo for my 8 month old grandson and he loves it. It's great exercise for his legs and there are lots of colorful toys to play with that move and make sounds.
5,Highly recommend this jumperoo!,"I highly recommend this jumperoo for your little one. My daughter loves it! She has been in jumping in it since 4 1/2 months old. Although it took her a little while to warm up to it, she now loves jumping in it, and playing with the toys!"
4,Rainforest Jumparoo,"Our 3 month old was maybe a little too young at first, but now that she's 4 months old, she loves this toy! We recommend it!"
5,Best jumper out there!!,"I bought this for my son and he loved it. He would play for an hr at a time and never cried or fussed at all. I would highly recommend this product for your baby. You would never regret purchasing this item it is not only fun, but safe as well. I only wish they did differnt designs to fit girls. I like the whole pink thing, but It still gets 5 stars."
3,my 6 month old gets bored quickly with it,Doesn't want to Be in the jumper longer than 10 mins... So kinda waste of money.. Tho it folds up easley to put away
4,Happy Jumper,"Over all very good product. Our 6 month old son loves it. When we got ours, the sticker on the rainbow toy was missing. I called Fisher Price to request a sticker but they can only replace the electronic toy part or the whole thing. So they are sending me a voucher for $10 off any Fisher Price item. The only other cons I have is the seat is almost impossible to remove for cleaning, & the batteries are difficult to replace. All in all, highly reccomend."
2,10 month old still too short for this,"I think the product idea is great. The problem that I have with this is that my 10 month old is still too short for this. Even now, we have to put blankets under him to reach the lowest setting. I am not sure what size baby this was made for? Thankfully my baby is skinny or we might have a problem getting him into the seat it his age. I guess I am just really disappointed at the size issues. We have saucer and a bouncer and even know he kind of likes the bouncer, he really prefers the saucer. The saucer has more toys and it just seems to entertain him more. In order to enjoy this product to it's full extent, you must have a tall, skinny baby.Update: My baby is now 12 months old and 28 inches tall. Unfortunately, he still has to have blankets under him to make him tall enough for this toy."
5,Best BIG toy for my baby! Her favorite of all time,"The minute I put my daughter in, she started to laugh. She loves this thing. She can be in it and jump over 15 minutes and not get bored. I used it for her from month 5 to month 9. It is just great!To be more detailed, here are the pros,Height--3 levels, pretty good estimate.Toys---each one has a meaning, such as rolling or flipping, or pushing.Music---great music, love it!Chair size---good for 4 month to 8 month, slightly tight for my 9 month old.Assembly--easy!The only con, is that takes a pretty large space in her room. But I guess look at all the advantanges, it is a must have for all babies!"
5,great baby item,"This item is well constructed. The baby enjoys the bright colors, fun sounds and flashing lights. It's light weight but durable. It's easy to make adjustments as child grows. The seat is machine washable and the other surfaces are easily wiped clean. I would highly recommend this product."
5,love it,"Love this item. We bought it 4 years ago for our first son. He played in it everyday! Eventually we packed it up and put it away. Now I have a 5 month old and we were looking at all the activity items for sale now. We decided to just go get out the old rainforest activity jumper. After 4 years and a couple of washings, it still looks brand new. Everything is in perfect condition, and this baby loves it just as much as our last baby. I love the soft comfy seat and the fact that it is easy to clean. With all the new products out there, one thing I can say about this one.... why change perfection? Thanks Fisher-Price!"
5,Jumping Fun!,Bought the jumperoo for my grandson. He is just on the first level so he should be able to use this item for a long time. He likes all the sounds and lights. He doesn't spin in the chair much right now but he is just 6 months old. It's very entertaining for him. Well worth the price.
1,"Baby loved it....but, we realized how harmful it is!","This is definitely a wonderful toy. Our baby loved it! He never complained to take him out. Our dr. told us they do not recommend this because it interferes with motor skills, I wasn't totally convinced, so I continued to use it about twice a day for 20 min. I noticed our baby became more fussy, and more demanding. He didn't like to sit still and play like before. Although, he still did great whenever in the jumperoo. He would move his head back and forth and seemed to want to go, go, go all the time. We realized he may be over stimulated. We then discontinued use of the jumperoo for a few days and saw remarkable improvement. He now loves to be calm and play with a toy. Although I am going to miss it, and I am sure he will too, we are going to get rid of it. I was saddened to read the reviews that quoted their babies could sit in it all day and that some would fall asleep in it. I just think if you use it, try to keep it as minimal as possible."
1,Unsafe,My baby's arm got stuck in one of the narrow arches while she was turning herself in the seat. We are lucky that she didn't break her arm as everything happened really quickly. I don't think the design is safe and will be returning the item.
4,Like it,My daughter enjoys bouncing in this jumperoo. Unlike other kids my daughter only stays in it about 20 minutes at the most.
5,Grateful that this product exists,"First off, I love how the music plays for 5 minutes, and it is easy for my baby to make enough motion to get the music to kick back on. We've been using this jumper since before my daughter was 3 months old (she was holding her head up steady since she was a month old and was perfectly capable of sitting in the seat - granted she sunk in a bit at first and didnt yet have the motor skills to reach & touch the toys). I like the toys except for the color wheel that spins it seems rather boring, but I think the other selections are stimulating & easy for her to play with.It is not terribly awkward to move around, which is nice.At 4.5 months she figured out how to jump in it and will usually jump the whole time she's in it. However it seems sometimes she gets upset from all the jumping but can't figure out to stop herself so she'll start whining while she's jumping."
4,Would purchase again,"We had originally purchased another jumperoo for my 7 month old, but returned it for this one instead because of the reviews.Pros:*Compact*Colorful*Animals that hang above head provide more to look at*Spring-like system makes jumping easy*Cute toys that spin within reach of child*Three height levels so it can grow with the childCons:*Seat is supposed to turn but takes a great deal of effort. Pretty much set in one position*Super annoying music and animal sounds! I usually keep it off.*Only holds attention for about 15 minutes, but that could just be because of a child's short attention spanIn all, I would purchase it again. When she's in it, my daughter will jump like crazy and smile super-big. I think it is a good jumperoo for the price and anything that can buy me an extra 15 minutes to unload the dishwaher or eat dinner is a keeper! Just don't plan on using the sound (did I mention is it SUPER annoying??)"
5,A Classic,"This is my second Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo. I had one with my 3rd child and gave it to a friend when he out grew it. When we were surprised with baby #4 and she turned 6 months, I knew exactly what jumper I wanted. This thing is high quality, easy to put together, fun and CUTE! I would recommend this product!"
4,Just what our 6 month old wanted for Christmas,"This Jumperoo is great. Feels very sturdy & safe. I appreciated the adjustable heights to accommodate a quickly growing baby. The toys are entertaining.Moving the Jumperoo from room to room is a bit tricky - it's an awkward size and is hard to fit through standard inside doors. But my baby doesn't care about those things - he's happy that he can be upright, entertained, and active.And as a bonus, it matches all of our other Fisher-Price Rainforest items."
5,My daughter can not stop to jump,"My daughter is almost 7 months now. She played it, when she was around 5 month. She really like it and can not stop to jump every time."
1,Don't waste your MONEY,Don't waste your money. The laser stays on about 30% of the time and I have to spin the blade by hand to turn it off. The laser line is about an eight of an inch. off so I have to line up the cut just like before. The only thing I can guess is that the quality control is not the best since the laser is mounted right next to the blade. If it were aligned properly in the manufacturing process then if would be a nice add on to my saw. The way it is it is just a nice red light. It is far enough away from the mark that I can't even use it to illuminate my cutting line.
1,The Kindle version lost all vocabulary definition,"I saw this book at bookstore. The left pages inside the book contain all SAT vocabularies for contents shown on the right pages. Each vocabulary has synonyms. It's good for students to build SAT words. However, after I bought the Kindle version, I was very disappointedly to found that the SAT word definition and synonyms were all gone! You have to use eBook's dictionary to check each bold word yurself. Amazon should indicate this to avoid misleading."
3,"Cute, but not what I expected:","Tea Society of a Witch has very cute artwork, and is a cool story, but I only rated this a 3 out of 5 because I was expecting this to be an ANIME when I purchased it. Turns out, Tea Society of a Witch may look like a normal anime, but it isn't what I would call an anime DVD. It's like an anime powerpoint program. It's not a movie, and the pictures don't move. (Although there are some tiny computer animated scenes that occur throughout the game, though it's really low tech animation, almost bad animation.) It's more of an RPG. You move throught the storyline playing as one character. Supposedly, you get ""passwords"" when you get to certain breaks in the game. I played for an hour and a half straight and never got a password, so I couldn't save my progress and return to my saved spot and resume the game. Also, the instructions that come with this interactive Anime DVD are really confusing, so buy at your own risk! P.S. Take the ""Rated ages 17 and up"" thing seriously!"
1,Not too great,"We just got this video, and we don't love it. We have Brainy Baby too. Brainy Baby is a bit clinical looking, and althoughit has good intentions, it's not very creative. This video is a little more creative, but all together not that great. My children are 1 year and 3 years. The baby will watch it for about 5 minutes at a time before turning his attention, and my three year old is way past it the content."
3,George's Polo Shirts,"I bought a 5XL Orange Polo from Casual Male Big and Tall with the George Foreman line. The fit and comfort were good but the colors did not last after 3 washes. However, it did not shrink. I would buy more of the item if the price was a little better."
3,Intriguing,"All I can say about this movie is, WOW! Once I sat down to watch it I couldn't get up from my seat.It's got suspense, intrigue, deception, and one BIG SURPRISE at the end. The movie is completely in Spanish save for the times when ""Lucia"" is talking on the phone to the mysterious ""Mr. Gordon.""This movie is not a fast-paced, Hollywood type of a movie, with special visual effects, and that's why I give it 3 stars.I can't remember the name of the movie where Bruce Willis stars, and there's a little boy who sees dead people. What's the name of that movie? What I'm trying to say is that ""Plaza Vacante"" is something like that movie with Bruce Willis...nothing really is as you see it, and the ending takes you totally by surprise.The moral to the story is, looks can be very, very, VERY deceiving.Low key, low budget, but powerful."
5,A Wild Ride,"If you don't think that a married couple, arguing loudly about which of them ""gets"" to pump their pregnant hostage's force-feeding device is funny, it's pretty safe to say that you should just avoid this film. But those who revel in sick, black comedy, deranged, eccentric characters and stories that get so, well, ""icky"" they make you laugh, will love this movie. I saw it on the USA Channel- after I rented it- and needless to say that all the good parts seemed to be cut out for TV. This is Jennifer Tilley's movie, and she is unstoppable. Gallo is a creep as her equally evil husband- and the scenes between them are among the best in the film. To be sure, this movie isn't for everybody; my mom, for example, would hate it- big surprise. It obviously wasn't made for her. This is a dark, cult film- no two ways about it. Scary and hilarious at the same time... I loved it."
5,Wein Batteries,"I have older Dacor underwater meters and finding the 1.5 volt battery has been almost impossible! Upon receiving the batteries I installed in a meter and they were spot on when compared to my minolta flash meter IV. If you have an older camera that used the discontinued Silver oxide battery, these are a perfect fit!They also will not break the bank!"
2,Low voltage output wrong height,"The output voltage was lower than rated. Height of the battery was less than older mercury replacement, as a result the batteries did not work in my Gossen light meter."
1,Doesn't work with canon FTB,"ordered 2 of these for my canon Ftb and although the meter still moves inside the camera when there is no battery installed, as soon as i pop one of these batteries in, the meter falls strait down and shows no signs of life. Pretty sure its these batteries, because alkaline cells do get the meter up again if i try those, although its usually gives me wonky readings."
3,Average camera that could be so much better,"A first this appeared to be a good little camera brimming with functions. It takes nice clear pictures outdoor, but the flash is weak. The zoom is clumsy, jumping from one extreme to the other, giving more of an effect of 4 fixed focal lengths rather than a fluid zoom.It's now broken haven taken the lightest of knocks on my last holiday. I don't know whether its worth repairing or whether I should take this a sign for a change. The battery life is poor (always keep a spare handy) and there's no mid-roll change.Having said that, for the price, with minolta excellent optics and lenses, you could do a lot worse. It's light, compact and easy to use, with an excellent data-back."
4,Unusual and Satisfying Book,"It's tough to get into the rhythm of this book at first, but once you do, you'll be engrossed in the narrator and his story. The storytelling is almost stream-of-consciousness in its style. I was expecting a thriller. It's not. But the writing is so interesting in the way the writer lets bits and pieces of the story seep out and lets you (the reader) put it all together. A good book with some fantastic characters."
1,Two adjectives: trite and pretentious,"This is how the book is written. The whole thing. Like this. Like this makes it deep. A story worthy of maybe twenty-five pages, parceled our in over three hundred. Little snippets. As if that makes the trite tale deep. Shallow. A shallow story, stupid in fact. So this trite tale blown up like this. Pretension. So the critics can claim he is like James Joyce. Wow. Really? Critics who can barely read with comprehension. Using big words they don't really understand, like nonlinear. For dribbling out the tale in little segments placed here and there in time. Told like this. Prose suitable for a dull forth grader. But isn't that what are critics are for? To make semiliterate readers think they are reading deep, difficult stuff? Want to read something like Joyce, read Portrait of the Artist or Ullyses. Skip this thing."
3,Early sounding & Experimental Prince,"This is a 2 CD set featuring Prince's voice, and probably (though not listed) his guitar playing. Prince co-wrote only one song. Musically it's an interesting jazz album, heavy on the early 80's style synth/beat. Some of it is Prince-catchy, a lot of it sounds more like a jam session than an album. Expect something that sounds like ""Controversy"" but with his Purple highness using a lower voice and I think you'll be in the right state of mind to enjoy it. I'm more into 'Thieves in the Temple'/'Gold Experience'-type Prince so it just wasn't quite my cup of Tea."
4,works well,Line turns out to be just a hair left of the cut. Other than that at this stage it seems fine. I have not used it long enough to know how durable it will prove to be.
1,If you are upgrading: Don't!,"I have been a user of Quicken for more than ten years, and this is the messiest upgrade I have ever seen. Surely, they have worked on the ""looks"" of it, although something could be said about how practical it is to use, but it's the FUNCTIONALITY that really leaves you stunned! Example: you use the calendar feature to help you remember of payments due, so you schedule payments. First of all, it does not remind you on time, causing you to be overdue (never happened before), then it reposts the same transactions, causing you (if you don't do the job manually) to send double payments!! If you check their support site, you will find out that it also causes duplicate records in your accounts, which (get this!) in a video you are shown how you can go back to correct, one transaction at a time! Much faster, and less messy to do it by hand. I am really sorry to say this, because I have been a die-hard Quicken user for many years, but this is really bad news!"
1,Unbelievably bad,"I must agree with the other reviewers: Q2005 is really really bad. The interface is cluttered, difficult to read, impossible to customize in the same way as Q2004. The conversion completely and irrecoverably trashed my stock option records. I have had to add adjusting transactions to make every one of my portfolio accounts balance to get rid of phantom shares that appeared after conversion. And not only does it do everything badly, it also does it slowly. Q2004 had its faults but at least you could read the register."
1,What Garbage!!!,"Well, Quicken forced me to switch from my version of 2002 by switching dl protocol with the banks... so I did, but what garbage!! Resource hog always checks in with Intuit site... I don't trust it at all. I've use quicken products for about 15 years, but I'm looking to switch."
3,Overanalytical for a summary history.,"The author spent an ungodly amount of his space in writing about John Adams theories and thoughs rather than spend the necessary time talking about his short one term Presidency. This clouded the enjoyability of this read. Rather than here what he did during his Presidency, we come away with his thoughts and theories about social class and political functions. Thus, this short read became difficult to those who wanted to know a little about our second President and his term in office.The American Presidents series are nice little summaries of all our Presidents. This book is not as interesting as some of the latter books."
1,Jumbo? NOT REALLY!...I got fooled,"I was really excited on gettting this ""jumbo"" barney for my niece. However, it was not jumbo at all. I think I was fooled by this jumbo title, and probably so were other customers, who purchased this toy! I don't think it was worth the money."
1,Barney is scary,"My 15mo son got this as a hand me down from a friend of ours when he was 11months old and it scared him. As soon as Barney started talking and waving his hands, he ran to mom and cried. We've tried several times to get him to play with it, but he refuses. To it's credit it does have a lot of variety for the interaction- does peek-a-boo, sings songs and other stuff. Plus ours turns on by itself, normally you have to touch it or interact with it somehow, but ours will start talking while it's sitting on the floor away from any one- kinda spooky. I'm definately glad I did not waste my money on it."
2,I Don't suggest,"[...]This book is usefull to a level, but over all rating is not good. The screen shots are terrible. The screen shots are referenced in many places and it is very difficult to read the contents of the screen shot. I'm surprised they even published this book without reviewing it properly. There are some positive things though"
2,"Should be named ""Marks-a-Little""","This is perhaps the most inappropriately named product ever. Maybe ""Marks-a-Little"" would be better. We have tons of these markers at my office. They work maybe half the time. They dry out quickly. Many come fresh out of the box barely working at all. Save yourself time and money and buy something else, like Expo markers."
5,"Only a person who has ""been there"" can truly understand","Marcia puts into words what those of us (like myself) with chronic illnesses have trouble telling others. Even when we do, they don't seem to believe us. This book has helped me to not feel so alone; provided excellent tips for more than just survival, but also even life enhancement; and given me something to wave under the unbelievers nose and say, ""see, I TOLD you so!"" (grin). Honestly, it can help those who care for you to see your side, and since it's Marcia putting it into writing, it sounds less like YOU complaining. If you have a chronic condition, or care about someone who does, the small cost of this book is less than most gifts, and it is the best way to say, ""I care"" that I know of."
4,One of many,"This is one of four books I've ordered, and I have not had time to read them all. This does look interesting, though, and maybe will garner a belly-laugh or two!"
1,Never Received,"All the other books I ordered from this shipment came in weeks ago. This one has yet to arrive, and it's well past the delivery date."
4,Completing the series,I good way to know how much people went through. The human has the strength to do just about anything.
2,I,"Good quality, but I bought it because it looks like it has ear flaps - which it does not. Still a nice hat, but not what I wanted."
5,good welder,"The ordered Buffalo Tools Aweld160 arrived in time, the price was good, and the welder works very well. All solid, well sized cable, I welded different size of metal with good success"
2,Great author - mediocre book,"This short volume has failed to spark much interest within me and my children. It lacks the poetic lilt of ""Goodnight Moon"" and the quiet force of ""Runaway Bunny."" The illustrations, many in black and white, seem from another era. Yet, they are not timeless and fail to inspire.Brown's muddled characterization of the essence of everyday objects seems neither accurate nor absurd, neither artistic nor banal. Why, for example, are we told that the important thing about a shoe is that ""you put your foot in it"" when so many more relevant characteristics could have been chosen? (protects your foot from harm, keeps your foot warm, makes a fashion statement, leaves footprints, gets mud on the carpet, etc.)"
5,Great Writing Lesson,"This is a wonderful book to use for a writing lesson. I used it in a 1st grade classroom. We read the book aloud and discussed the pattern the author used for each item. Then as a writing activity each student chose one person to write about. They followed the same pattern as in the book, saying that ""The most important thing about ________ is..."" After they finished, I had them share their completed poems with the person they wrote about. It was a very rewarding activity and the kids really loved it!"
4,Great for the beginning of the school year!,"I use this book at a ""getting to know you"" starter for the 1st day of school. After reading the book, the students start to see the pattern. I then have them write something about themselves using the same pattern in the book. ""The most important thing about Sue is that she likes to read. Sue has 3 cats, plays soccer and can pitch like Nolan Ryan, but the most important thing about Sue is that she likes to read."" I then have them illustrate these things on manilla paper or with the computer, then bind all of the pages into a class book. The kids love getting to know each other this way."
5,Make It Or Break It Gymnastics Inside Views,This was a very entertaining series that recreates the trials and tribulations that female gymnasts go through to be the best.Funny and dramatic at times with well casted ladies to portray olympic minded gymnasts.Too bad this series was not extended beyond this olympic year of 2012.Buy this dvd if you love gymnastics like me and millions of others.
2,blue color is too bright,"hey yall, i had this disk a few years ago, and to tell you the truth. itd be cool if it just stayed red or green. you might think a rainbow of colors is cool but on every throw, when it gets to blue, my night vision was totally ruined. it took away all the joy of nighttime throwing for me, cuz it would take away my night vision, and i couldnt see my brother. so. maybe look into getting one thats just a solid color that is not blue (higher frequency of the spectrum)g2g big love!plant those gardens"
1,Arrived Broken,The product was poorly wrapped - just in an envelope with no padding. It arrived broken.Now I have to go through the hassle & expense of sending it back & finding a new one for my son. Better packaging please!
1,Unless PERFECTLY LEVEL,"Bottom line, unless you have a site that is PERFECTLY level and close to power for the filter purchasing this type of pool will be a huge disappointment to the kids and a complete waste of money.I am not exaggerating the need for a perfectly level site."
