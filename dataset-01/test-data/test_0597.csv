2,didn't work well,"Item took a lot of effort to get to work, then didn't stay lighted for long. Other handheld dynamo flashlights worked fine, even better."
2,Not so great,"This DVD has a five star review by Ms. S. Vandegriff. It is not a five star product. Vandegriff has four other reviews, all of Berklee products. All of the reviews are five star and the all the descriptions contain the adjective ""great"". I feel a bit misled. The running time for this DVD is 32 minutes. Most of the time is spent talking about the groove and working with the drummer. There is not much time where Mr. Morris is actually playing the bass. I thought that as the title implies, Mr. Morris might be demonstrating several rock grooves. For me, the title does not correlate with the content. There is not much to be learned by watching this DVD. Two stars may be a generous rating."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I select this book as my formal textbook. But after reading the part1, I have to say ""It is not a great work"". I think the author is a professional writer, but can not be entitled guru compared with the author of ""The C Programming Language"" or ""Core java"" who can present the core very systemeticaly and cystally clear.Anyway, this book can be use as a warm-up for learning C#."
3,I cannot understand why the rating of this book ....,"I cannot understand why the rating of this book in amazon.com is good. I have bought this book based on the reader's review on amazon.com. But now I think the ratings from amzon.com is quite misleading.Before I read this book, I downloded .NET SDK and read C# documentation in it.I cannot find any new depth or information in this book more than the C# tutorial and reference SDK.This book is just cursory.One of the reason could be that C# does not have much to say to learned java/c++ programmer.But anyway, I wish the writer could provide readers with the unique characteristics of C# compared to java and c++.I am disappointed that the author does not mention that C# does not permit to specify the exception in the method definition.This is critical shortcomings from programmer's viewpoint.In conclusion, I have doubt why MS creates another language and why this book has so good reputation from reviewes from amazon.com."
5,An essential C# programming resource,"This is a great book and upholds O'Reilly's tradition of coming up with excellent work at just the right time. It caters for a wide range of programming experience from the novice programmer, to those (such as myself) who want to get quickly up to speed on more advanced techniques. Reflection and threading, for example, are not the kinds of topics that you would expect to find covered in an intermediate level book and I am glad they have been included."
2,This 4th edition is much worse,"If you are going to buy this book, stick with earlier editions. Earlier editions of the book included interesting in-depth discussions of Reflection. In fact, many links on the web discussing reflection or dynamic invokation reference this book's earlier edition. The new edition of the book, however, skips any in-depth discussion of .NET's underlying technology. If you are already programming in C#, you will get very little from this book. It may cover newer material, yet the newer material isn't difficult to master in the first place, so it provides little value."
2,Unless 2nd edition is a total rewrite!,"The first edition of this book isn't worth the money. The author tries to cover way to much in way to little of time. Trying to show the basics of int i = 0; to creating streaming network clients is way to much scope for 500 pages.In it's section about how to use the Visual Studio part the author is still using code examples instead of GUI examples. I have no doubt the author knows what he is talking about, but he doesn't know how to make others know what he is talking about."
3,Lacks practical application of concepts,"Jesse Liberty clearly understands the concepts of object oriented programming and C#, but fails to apply the information effectively. The begining chapters may be a bit too advanced for someone who has not worked with object oriented programming (although the book says it will be ok, it wont). The chapters on OOP move quickly and unless you can grasp new concepts quickly, youre better off buying his other book, Learning C#. However be warned, Learning C# is a repeat of the first few chapters of Programming C#, but just longer. As you read Programming C#, you will wait for some tutorial based real world examples, but you will never encounter them. Overall this book gets a 3 because it will teach you the fundamentals of OOP, but you'll find it hard to apply it to writing a real program. I picked up the Wrox books after this and I'm very satisfied now."
4,happily got exactly what I paid for,"I thought the first third of the book offered both a nice intro to c# for people with programming experience, and as a reference for those who like the feel of paper. If you are in this demographic, by all means pick this up.The last third of the book is what I paid for tho. The .net framework is a huge library, but Jesse has wisely chosen the least understood areas: threading, streams, and reflection, to really attack. I bought this book mainly because I wanted to get a nicely laid out hand holding on these technologies, and Jesse delivered."
1,Poor language coverage,"This book is really only a cursory guide to C#. It doesn't cover any advanced C# programming at all. But the book doens't cover basic language fundamentals very well.My rating may be harsh, but if the book doesn't cover the simple stuff well, but also isn't advanced enough for real programmers, what use is this book?"
5,Destiny,"it's pretty good. of course, i only bought it because Gina Carano was on it. they oughta make more videos of her. she's one hot lady. the other matches are good, too. it's worth the price they're asking for it. 2 dvd's of mixed martial arts."
4,Love the Pigs!,"I loved the story of ""Pigs in the House""! The rhyming makes the story move along, and the pictures are great. I was disappointed that this was not a full size book though, I didn't realize this when ordering. Other than that, a great purchase."
3,"It's ok, But...","It's a case, it works, but when you open the phone, like to take a picture, the back of the case is over the camera. You have to unsnap the back and hold it down. Thats kind of a pain. Otherwise it is a very nice setup."
1,Not for Programming. It explains how to use the compiler.,"For some reason, looking at the title, I thought this book would be about programming, for programmers. Instead it's about using a programs interface. This book need a new title. Like ""How to Use Visual C++ 6.0"", or ""How to get started with Visual C++ 6.0"". Not much of a programming book."
3,Pei Pei,"About architecture and a man whos got what it takes to sweep those commissions his way! I M may be from the old architecture school, but its good to watch him talk about how he interacts with his clients. I didnt know much about his work apart from the Louvre, and its rather nice to see his other projects. Pristine, clean with a slight technical twist, I M's work is quite a legacy. If youre not from the design and architecture backgrounds, the DVD might be a bit boring and long drawn for you."
5,FAMILY CHRISTMAS DVD,ADD THIS MOVIE TO YOUR COLLECTION...ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL FAMILY CHRISTMAS MOVIE...THE SCENARY IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL IN THIS MOVIE...IT IS WONDERFUL TO FIND A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE TO WATCH
4,retrol feel but scary for some younger ones,"when i purchased this i did not realize it was a very old version. i remember green eggs and ham but didn't remember what the grinch story was like. my 2 1/2 year old was scared of the grinch story, particularly when he was whipping the dog. i wanted to turn it off but he just wanted me to sit next to him and hold his hand throughout the story. he also wanted to be like his 4 1/2 big brother who wanted to watch it. after the first viewing he was ok and when he watch it again he was ok without my being right next to him. i am not sure i would have purchased it if i knew about the whipping scene in the grinch story, so i don't like to play it unless they specifically request it insistently. i always emphasized that it is make believe, only a story and not real and usually suggest another story to watch."
5,Well Worth the Time...,"Not so coincidentally I found this book in the discard bin at a local library... As an avid book collector in the ""esoteric"" or more spiritual types of literature I could not pass up the opportunity to take the ""freebee"" home despite that it wasn't normally what I would have picked up. I was quite surprised to find an absolutely readable and enlightening book which I could not put down....In all the materials I have studied I believe this book is one of the top 10 for understandable and practical spirituality that could apply to anyone of any faith. In fact, the best part is that it had nothing to do with religion, and everything to do with the soul of every person. Well worth more than one read....Hope to see some reprints and other books by this author."
4,It is a worth reading over and over again...,"This book has opened my eyes on how to live a better life. The story gets better and better as it goes long. You can get so envoled with the book, that you become the main charater and feel his pain and his happiness."
1,o so sick,I'am a care giver for my 76 year old grandmother who has severe dementia as well as a stay at home mother of a 2 and 5 year old. I was desperate for some energy from something other than chugging mountain dews(I dont drink coffee). I got this vitamin and was very excited to start it. After taking this(after eating a full breakfast) I rode along with my husband to run some errands and the sickness hit my so quickly I couldnt even get the window rolled down before I vomited everywhere! It was worse than morning sickness! I thought maybe I had just came down with a bug so I tried it again a week later and once again I was sick and dizzy. I have never had a problem with vitamins before this one. This one was a total bust.
5,love them,From the first time I stated taking these vitamin I felt a difference. These are the first vitamins I have ever taken. I feel better and my mood is better when I take them.
4,Fresh sound and great album,The first thing you notice about Pillar is that they seem much more mature than many of the other rap-rock bands out there today. Pillar doesn't feel a need to scream swear words every other line or just trash other people and bands like a kid in grade school. Instead they bring a fresh and spirited style of song writing that takes the great beats and guitar riffs and throws great song writing ability on top of them. Pillar are able to seperate themselves from the rest of their genre because they don't follow the exact forumla that others do. Their songs are catchy and powerful and very melodic. Give them a shot and you'll have a new band to follow.
1,Scraping the bottom of the barrel,"This has to be one of the worst albums that has ever been made in the history of Christian music. The type of singing used reminds you of Vanilla Ice, and the lyrics are childish at best. Considering how cocky the lead singer is, you would think he would have some kind of talent to match it, but I guess he has to do something to make up for his lack of talent.Musically this album is about as fresh and new as five-month-old milk, and it is as inventive as a blank piece of paper. there are 100,000 bands doing what Pillar is doing now, and 99,990 of them are doing it better. I received this album free when I went to see EastWest and The Benjamin Gate on the ""Fireproof Tour."" If I had paid one dime for this album, I would have been irate.If you want to hear good, inventive, and real music, try EastWest's ""The Light in Guinevere's Garden"" and avoid this stuff like the plague."
1,What A Waste!,I bought 2 of these fans @ $7 each. The water leaks out!! My daughter used hers for about 10 minutes and the fan quit working. The on/off button on my sons broke after the 3rd time he turned it off. Don't waste your money.
4,Great on a hot day,"I just saw this Saturday at a lovely outdoor wedding. At 105 degrees it was very uncomfortable. Some people had old fashioned paper fans, and one table had several of these devices. We managed to borrow 1 and it was wonderful. I don't know how long they last, but in really hot weather who cares as long as they last through the day. Loved the sprits, the fan worked very well, and I didn't notice any of the other problems mentioned. I am buying one for my aging mom who is often very uncomfortably hot when she ventures outside. It's not a heavy duty fan, nor should it be, and it isn't a replacement for air conditioning, but on a really hot summer day when you have to be outside, it's wonderful."
1,Piece of Junk,"On/off switch broke on day 1. My expectation for a $9 plastic fan were not very high, but this fan still managed to fall short."
4,How to get your Dead 60s CD onto iTunes...,"I too was pissed that I couldn't import this CD into my iTunes player. I spent about 10 minutes on google trying to find a way, and I did. http://cp.sonybmg.com/xcp/english/faq.html#ipod - that will take you to the FAQ section of Somy BMG and at the bottom it says CLICK HERE to find out how to import into your itunes. Do that, enter your e-mail and within minutes they'll send you an e-mail telling you how to do it."
4,No problem loading,"Not sure why but I didn't have any trouble loading mine onto iTunes. Great CD, unique sound -worth buying."
1,Beware - Copy Protected CD,"I guess they figure I'm some sort of criminal for wanting to listen to the CD on my computer because they placed some lame copy protection on this disk. I've wasted the last half hour of my life trying to play it on iTunes and I can't. That's where I listen to my music. If I can't play it in the player of my choice it is useless to me.I don't know why these record companies don't get it; I bought the music, let me consume it. So, guess what guys, I've learned my lesson: Never buy a CD from Epic again.I'm returning it today. And I am so angry I might just scream."
4,Pro-Biotics by Healthy Trinity,"Product arrived quickly. I was a tad disappointed in the packaging material , seeing the last time I ordered it came in a styrofoam cooler with a couple of gel packs to keep cold. But all in all I love the Product. I swear by Pro-Biotics everyone should start taking them and begin a healthier lifestyle change. Will order again and again."
5,Humbolt River,This was much more of a book than I expected. A fascinating and detailed history of this little known region. An excellent read!
4,Love the one song I've heard!!,"I've only heard one song from this album, The Tocadisco remix of ""You're My Disco"" and it is awesome!!! Fun synthpop in the classic eighties style with a very modern sound. I only wish I could hear the rest of the songs before buying."
4,I like it,"I got this to replace a similar unit that I had dropped.This unit is versitle, you can have a card for working out, and another for hanging out and not nave to skip songs that are too far out of what you're looking for at that time.The file management system on the unit is great, broken down into folders and catagories.I loaned this to a friend of mine, and he forgot it in his pocket and washed it. After I got it back, I had to replace the battery and delete the corrupted music on it, before putting music back on it... after that, it worked again!"
2,This hat is too small and tight,"I do not have a big head, normal I'd say. And this hat is tight on the loosest velcro setting, the hat sits too high on your head, and the bill is too short. Hard to tell from a picture and it's not how I like a hat to fit."
1,Don't waste you money,If you are looking to learn about Win 98 buy ANY other book. This is a complete waste of time in my opinion.
5,A GREAT READ,"This story is one of the best I have read in a long time. Elizabeth Kerners style is unique and her ability to decribe is fantastic. I think what I liked best was that her main character Lanen was not the prettiest or even the smartest character but that she was strong and followed her beliefs. I found the romance between Akhor and Lanen refreshing. It was not the steriotypical ""love at first sight"" non sense someone described below. Also yes they did have an interspecies romance but if you go on to read the second and third book in this series Akhor gets changed back into a dragon!! So all the problems don't just dissapear. Anyway like I said its a great read. You won't get much sleep though so if you pick this book up don't expect to put it down till you finish."
3,High flying reviews don't substantiate,"I have to agree with the reader who wrote that he was disappointed after hearing all the glowing reviews for this book. I saw that Jane Yolan had praised her and went into this book expecting more than I got. I wish that I hadn't read the reviews because then I would have enjoyed this book more than I did. The characters were all well thought out and the forbidden romance, which turned out to be the main focus of the book, was well-written. Other than that the story was predictable and the villian, who had demons after him to repay a debt, was extremely non-threatening and stupid. I HATE stupid villians. I never worried that any of the good characters would die. From the tone of the book I knew that if anyone died it would only be the bad guys. All said, it was an average read. If, unlike me, you like romances, you would probably enjoy this book more than I did."
3,"Good Plot, Bad Writing","While the dragons were different, especially the romance between them (which I found disgustingly unrealistic), this book is not one that deserves 4 stars at even the most. While the story was interesting, the writing was dull. While the main character was spunky, she was stick-like in personality. So many things contrasted the other, I found this book horrid."
4,A well-written twist on the dragon/human relationship theme.,"Kerner takes up a well-worn theme, the relationship between dragons and humans, and gives it a fresh voice. The characters, especially the admirable but very human Lanan Kaelar, are engaging and believable. The technique of warning the reader of a shift in first-person narrative allows the reader to get inside the head of various characters without confusion regarding who is speaking. Despite a satisfying conclusion, the mission to restore the Lesser Kindred is unfulfilled, leaving me eagerly awaiting a sequel."
5,Unsearchable is phenomenal!,"You'd never believe this movie was a debut of young filmmakers. The intriguing plot, fascinating characters, and mesmerizing cinemaphotography create a story that you can't help but get lost in. And believe me, you'll be glad you did!"
4,Cheyene Crossing : The Journey,The book was good and well paced. The post civil war period is a favorite story and movie period of mine. I think this has great possibilities as a movie.
5,Great espresso maker,This one is way better than the Class model. The handle is very comfortable and it cleans-up much better than the Moka. The 10 cup makes 2 large cups for me- a nice wake-up in the morning. I recommend this one without reservation.
1,Made in Italy?? TRY MADE IN INDIA!...,"When I ordered this Bialetti Espresso Coffee Maker I was sure I was getting one made in Italy. But (deceptive advertising?) the one I got was made in India... Is there any difference in the product? I own other sizes and can tell the difference. The difficult lid handle is one of them, plus the craftsmanship and finish are remarcably inferior. Yes, it makes good coffee, but now that is not the issue. All I can say is that I did not get what I bought. Why there was no disclosing of the product origin, but all you read makes you THINK you are getting a product made in Italy? I consider myself deceived."
4,A good read,"It is an interesting book and being interested in philosophy/Buddhist philosophy it is a good read. I would suggest this as a book to other interested in similar genres of text, but I do find literature from the Dali Lama and Thich Nhat Hanh more reader friendly.I guess this may be a read for the more knowledgeable - so if you have been reading such literature for some time it may be a book for you. If you get this for a good deal pick it up. If you are very keen to discover pick it up."
2,Enthusiastic but superficial,"Unfortunately, this book fails to a overcome a gee-whiz attitude toward Guatemala. It seems as if the author and the destination were not a good fit, both in terms of analyzing the country and its culture, and in the quality of its writing, which is often choppy and non-sequitur--though this could also be an editing problem.The apparent promotion--or at least tolerance--of drug consumption in Panajachel is unfortunate. Whether or not one agrees with the criminalization of marijuana or any other controlled substance, it is not a topic that should be treated so lightly in a country where the police have a reputation for corruption and the prospect of a jail term is truly frightening."
2,Buyer be warned!,"This book relates to a thoroughly outdated version of KDE, 1.1. Version 2 is a different world in many respects. Be sure that you're using an archaic version of KDE before you spend money on this book. Otherwise the book might have some kind of historical value I guess. Advice to the author: it's very easy to overuse the word ""breathtakingly"" when you're writing about software."
2,past its sell by date,"i'm very disapointed in this product,its totally dated,made no effort to up scale sound to dolby,in fact did absolutly nothing to inhance it,what a dissapointment,i'll never watch it again after first time.dont buy it."
2,"Muscle Builder, Not Aerobic","This video is about building muscles in your thighs and butt. It's not a very good cardio workout. I don't recommend it, unless you enjoy Barbie's in Thongs."
4,Great DVD,This DVD works for me. I use it as a substitute when I can't make it to the gym. I've not done step aerobics in a long time and I really worked up a sweat. It's probably not a DVD for people who are intermediate or advance steppers they will probably find it boring.
5,I prefer this version.,"Microsoft does not do a good job summarizing the changes it makes in each edition of Office. I like 2007 as it is not a total remake of prior versions. There are some more efficient processes, but unfortunately Microsoft makes you go through layers of help screens to find the procedures you learned in the prior versions. The biggest changes I have come across are in the ACCESS database. I had to relearn the software, but the 2007 version is more efficient.I don't care about 2010 as no one has told how upgrading to this version will make use of the software easier and I don't want to take an all day class to relearn what I know about the older versions of Office."
4,"Education Director, NJ State Golf Assoc. Foundation","Having trouble loading data from 2002 version of Access to 2007. New version more complicated and not as easy to enter and retrieve data. Hopefully, I will eventually learn to navigate it."
3,Needed More Seasoning,"I love Jane Monheit. She's one of the best jazz singers to come down the pike in a long, long time. She can literally move you to tears with the beauty and heartfelt emotion of her voice. Ergo, one would think that her very first Christmas CD would be a can't miss, what with the legendary Al Schmidt handling the production chores. Well...The disc starts off just fine with a smooth, upbeat rendition of Donny Hathaway's This Christmas. The second track, Merry Christmas Darling, is a real tearjerker, the best version since the Carpenters original. The Man With the Bag offers a nice contrast; short, sweet, upbeat and fun. Moonlight in Vermont, the one non-holiday offering, is evocative and charming.But from there, the disc runs out of gas. Jane's vocals are still fine and there's nothing really wrong with the arrangements, both just seem to lack the inspiration that was evident in the earlier cuts. It's listenable, but not the classic that it showed the promise of being."
1,"Buy the DualDisc or wait for the ""clean"" CD",I bought this on DualDisc. It does not have the XCP rootkit software that Sony is now infamous for. Do not buy the XCP protected CD version (it has been recalled anyway).Jane's music is great. Sony's ethics-not so much.Whatever happened to the Sony that fought copy restriction all the way to the Supreme Court when the VCR was invented?
2,Book is only good for the beautiful Pug Photographs!,"This book in my opinion has many ""labels"" and misguided information I found a bit offensive to Pug owners! Chapter 64 the author limits Pug Owners into four categories that comes off as biased and ignorant! Limited basic information, Nacho Pug gives this 4 PUGGY PAWS DOWN! This book in my opinion was only good for the beautiful photographs of adorable pugs."
2,"this book isn't bad, but it's quite thin","Maybe I was hoping for too much? But I didn't find it particularly in depth. I still had lots of grooming, health and vaccination questions.On the other hand...this isn't a generic dog health/training book. And the author has several pugs and knows the breed's quirks.It's the most entertaining dog breed book I've ever read, but not the most informative."
3,"Fun, but the hype may have done it in for me...","Here's some applause for an intelligent, art-centered kid's mystery studded with some sharp writing and magnificent illustrations that are works of art all on their own. Now for the dose of reality in the midst of all the hype: the story doesn't hold up. Things begin to crumble halfway through when (don't worry, I'm not going to give away any specifics plot points) the mystery's solution begins to be uncovered via some very flimsy ""feelings"" and coincidences. That's something of a betrayal to a setup that was, until that point, so clean and logical. I was so charmed by Petra and Calder that I would happily read another book about them. In fact, next time around, I'd like to learn a little more about the two of them."
4,A good mystery!,"This book was recommended to me by my family, so I took thier advice and read it. I thought it was a good mystery that keeps you guessing until the end. I also liked the historical element to it."
4,Good Book,"This book is a little puzzling in the beginning, but it gets alot better toward the end. If you like art, or mysteries you will like this book!"
2,Beautiful waterfalls... where??,"Hmmm...Loved the subject matter, but how perplexing to use those waterfall locator maps!"
1,Kindle readers beware!,"This may turn out to be a really good read, if you can stumble past the horrible character recognition job that was done on it for Kindle. ""I"" is printed as the number 1, names are spelled differently from page to page, everyday words are misspelled. If I wasn't reading this for a book club event, I would have deleted it after reading the initial 20%"
5,The Most Creative Book I've Ever Read,"This is undoubtedly one of the best books of the year 2005. It's wonderfully written by Hart, and Helquist's cheeky drawings are topping on the cake. It is different than I expected in that it makes Captain Hook likable while still keeping his sharpened edge."
5,Amazing!,"Very intriguing and well written. Not recommended for younger readers. The book develops Capt Hook's character much more fully than ""Peter Pan,"" explaining and humanizing the antagonist exponentially."
4,WHAT A BRILLIANT IDEA!,"I have always loved the villains the best in stories: Long John Silver in Treasure Island; Professor Snape in Harry Potter; Captain Hook in Peter Pan; and the list goes on. Now, after all these years, someone has the clever idea to write a book explaining the who and why and how of Captain Hook! I think it's marvelous! An extraordinary concept that I wish I'd thought of - and been talented enough to have been able to have written such a book! It doesn't take any of the magic away from the original Peter Pan story for me at all (as another reviewer claimed it did for him)! Not one bit. In fact, it simply adds to the Peter Pan fantasy's rich and long-lasting mystique!"
2,not so wonderful,"Was really hoping, after reading all the wonderful reviews, it would actually make a difference. It did not! Did cause GI upset- quite a bit actually. Never noticed any difference. Don't waste the $!"
3,Not what i expected.,"I thought i was getting a thicker cloth but its rather thin. They do work ok, i've just had to adjust the amount of wax i use in order for them to pull the hair. Its a big pack so i'll finish what i have but i def wont be buying these again!"
1,what happened yuk?,"what is this crap. let me start by saying that i am a long time fan of yukmouth. i have almost every album and most of the mix tapes. been bumpin yuk for years now, and i never heard anything like this. this is all r&b and r&b sucks. yukmouth had always been straight up gangsta rap, and this cd is pure garbage. if you like r&b or club type songs then this is your bag. but if you are looking for gangsta ass lyrics and tight beats, i would check out city of dope,or godzilla."
5,Soaring With Ford's Better Idea!,"We all know the 1960-65 Ford Falcon was definitely Ford's Better Idea. A light, economical car, the spiffy little Falcon could comfortably seat 6 grown people. This beautiful streamlined Ford has been preserved for Falcon lovers in this detailed model. What's not to like? It's beautiful; it's perfectly detailed and it speaks to the bright light in Ford's light bulb - this car really IS a Better Idea!"
2,Not exactly what I expected,"I purchased this book thinking that it would have real details about restoring my MGB roadster....NOT Really...Yes, it does cover many items, but not in the real detail that one needs to do a restoration....I was disappointed overall....It was almost ""generic"" in nature, and just wasn't the book I thought it would be....Most folks that are taking on a project like this, are already pretty decent mechanics, but have not necessarily worked on British sports cars....Otherwise, they wouldn't need a book to help....I read through it once, and never picked it up for help again....Much better off with Internet forums, Chilton publications, and factory workshop manual."
2,MGB Restoration Manual,"I purchased this book thinking it was an updated version of the ""Guide To Purchase and DIY Restoration of the MGB"". I was really surprised to find that the new edition lacked many of the tutorials found in the original book, and was more geared toward people reshelling their MGB using the Heritage body shells now available.While the book is good for those who are just starting with their MGB, I would recommend getting the first edition to see how one really restores an MGB back to its original condition. I have owned my MGB for over twenty years, and I can tell you that the original book is much more in depth for those that like to get their hands dirty."
2,MGB Restoration,I've owned the same MG since '78 and it was beginning to show it. This manual has enlightened me on what it's going to take to bring it back to original condition.
4,Good resource,"With the literary excerpts, the book includes a biography of the author, the times in which the author lived (which gives more depth and understanding to the piece), and footnotes of difficult vocabulary. Good resource."
1,Kurt Brungardt needs to stay at training Olympic Althletes.,"What can I say at how horrible I have found this workout video? Like I said Kurt needs to go back to training Olympic Athletes. The movements and the workouts are jarring and I sprained my neck after working out with this tape. I couldn't hardly keep up with the warmup and the warmup was designed so that I couldn't design it for my aerobic level. After two trys at this cassette tape, I threw it away. It was that horrible. May this be a warning to me not to buy his book. I have better things to do with my time and money. Why didn't Men Of Steel give Girard the job for this workout video god I don't know. Just a firm warning for anyone seeking an ab workout program: this video isn't it."
5,Low level tonic for the brain injured,"Like this stuff. Boosts blood flow to your brain, but doesn't noticeably interfere with neurotransmitters. Also helps relieve soreness in your brain/head. 518mg per capsule is overdoing it though. I never take the whole thing at once.It has a different effect on your brain than Panax ginseng. Panax feels more psychoactive than this, so I tend to avoid it and go with Korean Red instead.This stuff used to sell for $7.97 but the price has shot up since this past summer. I started buying this a couple years ago after sampling its effects by drinking Ginseng Up!."
5,"Wales, the land of magic, where anything is possible","This is a story of how fate brings together two unwilling participants with an attraction to each other they cannot deny. When Gwen inherits an ancestral home in Wales, she becomes involved with Owen, the magnificent but dark stranger who is her neighbor. Gwen is drawn into the danger Owen is trying to quell when she discovers it directly below her home. The two of them barely escape with their lives with some help from an unknown source. Could it have been the dragon that is said to live below her ancestral home that lent the unwitting help? Some fun and magic in a world gone mad where together they make a difference."
5,Ribbion Rescue was a excellent book.,"I thought it was an excellent book because it had a lot of details. My favorite part was in the end because it had a beautiful ending. My favorite character was Jillian because she was helpful. The book reminded me of my cousin because he had lost his wedding ring. I would read this book to my cousins, nephews, and nieces."
4,Much appreciated gift,"Not much to review. This was purchased as a gift for a trainer to symbolize one of the styles of Conflict Resolution. It was a well received gift, fit the need perfectly."
4,AR Wally,The book arrived on time and just what I was looking for. I have a couple of Fred FOSS pieces and knew nothing about this artist. Great to find a book that had the details I needed. Such a deal.
5,Maggie at her best,All her hits from the Dutch hitparade on one cd including title number When you're gone number one in Brazil.After she was dumped by Mouth She had 5 Top 40 hits in the Netherlands and was succesfull all over Europe with her Eurovision songcontestentry Amsterdam.A great singer and still going strong with a new partner as Mouth and MacNeal in 2009
4,"Nice product, poor packaging",This was a gift for my sister-in-law and it was full of nice products. But the bag it comes in was ripped and made the gift look extremely cheap. If it were for personal use this wouldn't be an issue. The slippers were my only other complaint. They looked cute but appeared like they might wear down and get ratty after a few uses.
3,Great gift for a sister,"I loved the Spa Sister name :) and my sister actually liked it (yes, not as easy as it seems). Is nice for a tiny present."
1,I have no idea what these guys were thinking.,"Yikes. I have no idea what these guys were thinking. This is a launch game for the Saturn, but that does not mean it is any good. Graphically, it is poor, and trails in comparison to EA's NHL games. I had absolutely no fun with this, and it is nothing but a waste of time and money. Do not rent, do not buy, do not even consider."
4,Good beginning,I purchased the book to help me get a head start in my upcoming ultrasound program and it is very detailed but in terms that are easy for me to understand as a beginner. Excellent starting point
1,terrible,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM! I ONLY GAVE IT 1 STAR BECAUSE I HAD TO OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN NONE!!!!! I recieved the item and Disk 1-movies 1&2 were missing, contacted amazon and they sent me out a new one and the same thing, Disk 1 was missing again! However, Amazon was very helpful and did credit me back for the purchase. I dont even know if you can purchase it anymore because I was told that they were going to remove it due to this, but if it is still out there do not purchase!"
3,"Didn't realize it was audio, until it arrived... duh...","Was slightly surprised when an audio tape arrived. But it was worth it. The contents are good. Solid information. Just that I like to listen to my aduio tapes while driving, and then I seldom have anything to write on. My bad. Info is god, though."
5,Review,Overprotected-Album Version 10/10Overprotected-Remix11/10Overprotected-Dub9/10This a great single!!!!
1,WTF?,"If you loved ""7"" or ""Apoclypatic Manifesto"" don't even bother with this pathetic CD. A few of the songs(Soultaker/Starsign/Eclipse) are actually awesome, but the rest is pure trash. When I first heard ""7"" and Love Never Dies I thought it was the best song ever. I was stoked that Love Never Dies Part 3(LNDP3) was on there, but it's nothing at all like the first one."
1,music going down hill. . . . .,"i use to be a pretty big fan of apop about the time ""7"" came out. this cd is pretty much [terrible], with the exception of starsign, this cd is a waste. his music use to be ever-changing throughout the song, beautiful strings, beautiful pads, and lush beats, now it's just mainstream garbage. it is filled with repetitve beats and unintelligent lead lines.if for some reason you do like the new direction of apop, check out the new covenent. . . . they're going in the same direction that apop has.his music isn't progressing by any means. . . ."
4,Grothesk tries new ways to impress us,"Apoptygma Berzerk are one of the greater EBM(electronic body music) groups. Their leader, Stephan Groth mixes this style with electropop, industrial, evn noise pop at will. This album is much different than the previous ones, with an obvious attitude towards trance. You should hear the excellent hits Eclipse,Starsign and Soultaker, the sweet electropop Kathy's song, and all the experimental tracks they have included in this album (for example, their remix of Metallica's Fade to Black) Many tracks are unbelievable hits, but some other can be hardly enjoyed and this is the only problem of this album."
3,Pop Versus EBM,"If you like electro pop, but want something harder, this is the place to be. Welcome to Earth manages to capture both fields nicely. A very clean production, and aggressive rythms. CD starts of nicely with ""everything we know is wrong"" and ""starsign"" which is a definate highlight. ""eclipse"" keeps the pop/ebm theme going quite well, landing squarly into dancefloor territory. ""help me"", a great instrumental, with vocal samples thrown in here and there. ""kathy's song"", borders a Depeche Mode melody, with pop sythns, still crusing along nicely. ""untitled 3"" marks a kinda midpoint of the CD..... from here its down hill. The rest seems to be a kinda mish-mash of things, with no real consistancy. Melodies, just arent as strong, and it almost sounds like stuff that used as a filler. All in all, the first 6 tracks are worth the effort though."
1,CAN'T REVIEW,I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS ITEM ... CREDIT WAS GIVEN ... GUESS IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OFFERED FOR SALE
5,"A great game, literally without any flaws","EA Sports has definitely done a great job on NHL '97.The gameplay is great. All the checking and penalties are included.The graphics are excellent for a 32-bit console.NHL '97 also includes the feature of creating your own players, and dividing up the available points to different attributes.Best of all, each player has their own signature technique that you can always use while playing with the push of a button.NHL '97 is definitely a great hockey game for the Saturn. Although when compared to later versions, it just can't compare to NHL '99. Would make a great addition to your Saturn library!"
4,Gangland,"This is my favorite season of Gangland due to the fact that it takes a look into some of the west coast gangs that I'm familiar with like the Bloods, Crips, and 18st. They go into the history of the gangs which is good, but they don't really look into the culture of the gangs too much. It's more like they're painting an image of all gang members being nothing more than low life criminals, but anyone who's grown up around gangs can tell you the lifestyle is much deeper than that. Even with that said, I still say this is a good buy for anyone interested."
5,Best Season of Gangland,This was a terrific Christmas present for my brother-in-law. He has shown everyone that visits him this DVD set.
5,"The Nest, Maryjo Koch","The Nest, by Maryjo Koch is a delightful work revealing the spirit of her subject (birds/nests/eggs) with remarkable attention to artistic detail. The text (except publisher notes and the forward) are handwritten or hand-lettered . . . all with charming variety of style and movement.On some of her drawings, she has left portions without color; thus, revealing the architecture of her black and white line art. At the side of several illustrations, she provides ""brush smears"" of colors with the name of the base paint colors used in the blends.The book is a fascinating blend of ornithology and beautifully executed art."
4,Soft spikes,this was my first purchase on Amazon. it was quite easy ... as for the product... soft spikes... it is winter time and i will have to see how they wear....... But there were 18 or 19 in a container which i believe is more than in the containers at various golf shops....price was attractive
5,Cleats that last a while on your golf shoes,"These cleats are dependable, and last a reasonable time. Easy to twist on and off. Plastic spikes are now standard at public golf courses. Know that when a few wear out, do not replace ALL on the shoe, just those that wear down. That will stretch your money further. I like the black and white colors. Easy for any shoe. The green color and the purple color are a bit too much."
4,Pulsar spikes,Softspikes PULSAR Fast Twist Golf CleatsSpikes were very easy to install only needing a quarter turn. Traction was very good and they were comfortable. good value.
5,good spikes,"Installed these in 6 pairs of golf shoes last fall. Still new, because it's winter in Michigan, so don't know how well they will hold up."
3,Not bad,"When i saw this CD, i thought it would be along the lines of Christy Carlson Romano's CD. And i was right - it is. Except it's better. Emma Roberts sounds good considering the stuff was recorded when she was 14. Some songs are better than others, of course. ""Dummy"" is probably the best one. But songs like ""I Have Arrived"" and ""This is Me"" are also great. ""Say Goodbye To Jr. High"" has a great tune, but really silly lyrics. But with a 14 year old, you cant expect very profound lyrics.I'd reccomend this CD for younger teens and tweens. Fans of Christy Carlson Romano, Myra and Katelyn Tarver will love this CD."
4,A review by Rosie!,"I liked every song except the songs ""Punch Rocker"" and ""new shoes"". I really didnt get those two songs. No offense to her but I loathed those two songs. I mean i just didnt see the point in making a song having to do with ""new shoes""! i mean she can do better than that! Anyway the beat/tune to all her other songs are good. But the lyrics are a little childish( you can tell by the name of her songs). But overall the TUNE of her songs ( besides the two i mentioned) are really good:)Plus she has a really good voice:)[...]"
1,Oh my god.,"ack!! This CD is crap. don't waste your money on this junk.The songs r stupid, and the voice u hear is the computer, not her. she can't sing, she can't act, and her show is stupid."
3,Ummmm ? :+0,"well this CD was not like any other it was more on the kinda cheesy side but it's an ok CD pre teens would like but i wouldn't say it's a rip off only beacause it has 10 songs i think she can go far with her career but not with songs like this she is a good singer but these songs the way there written is crud i'm 13 going to be 14 so maybe i'm just not into this music so yeah but i give this CD a 3 almost 4 so parents going to buy this for there kids i say eeh just if there into it but as i said it's is ok if i didn't it's an ok CD ! Td,"
2,Growing a Girl: Seven Strategies,"This book seems like it was written 20 years ago. It talks about making your daughter stronger by not dressing her up in ""girly clothes"" and encouraging sports. Girls of today are well beyond that 1950's behavior. My 8 year old expects that she will be president someday and plays boy's little league and soccer. This book is useless in 2005."
1,You Can't Give No Stars ?,"How bad is this book, this book is so bad that I got so frustrated that I closed the book, created an Amazon account (Quite easy Amazon is not bad) just so I could voice my negitive opinion of the book.After reading this I have relized that Software Engineering should be called Software Buracracy, This book contains 704 pages of information that could be voiced in 100, the boring and long examples plus repitition makes this book an annoying book to read. You may be thinking it will be good for a reference book, alas I personly find it faster and more effective to use the internet as a reference then this extremly large and badly written book.Perhaps im unresonable but the price is a bit steep for firewoodI hope this review helped you."
1,i love this book!,"in 1977, my husband gave me this book for our first christmas, per my request. loved it then, love it now. gave it to my son and his girl for christmas, and hope they will love it as much as i do. it's a classic, so fun and imaginative, then gnomes so shy and ednearing."
2,Not the right product,This did not work for me. I was hoping to find something to polish my silver with and not have to use messy creams. This did not work for that. It works well for jewelry tho.
1,do not buy,"Just got the set of those, price was right.Put them in the car and started having problems, eventually found out that one coil from four is defective. I guess I get what you pay for."
4,What happened whith SQL Server?,"From my point of view it is an excellent book, since it regards every way of connecting to databases. In the one hand it is updated, and the author properly explians wether a method is proper or not, and the whole book is fool of examples, and you dont have to type them because ther is a CD-ROM included for it with all the codes.In the other hand it is focused on Netscape's browser, though it touch rather slightly Microsoft's browser, and the book could have been titled simply : ""DATABASES WHITH VISUAL BASIC 6.0"" because it does not explain at all the diference betwen SQL SERVER, ORACLE, ACCESS, MySQL or whatever."
4,Not the best in the series.,"""Marina"", the third novel in the ""Heirs of Anton"" series about four generations of women and their adventures in Russia, is set in the middle of World War 2. This book has more of a romantic element, and less of the mystery of the first two books, which is nice for a change of pace, but at the same time, is a bit disappointing. The action-packed momentum of the first two books in the series seems to slow down in ""Marina""; however, much of the intrigue of the first two books points to the interaction between Edward and Marina, so this novel is certainly central to the whole series. I found the writing quality to be a bit lacking in this book - a bit too sensationalistic for my taste, too overly dramatic. All the same, i enjoyed this novel, and greatly enjoyed the first two in the series, so I am looking forward to reading the final book of the series next!Grade: B"
1,Garbage,"This book is garbage. Shame on any teacher who uses this textbook!-poorly written-poorly edited-verbose : two to four times the necessary words-bad grammar-poor layout with inconsistent headings and subheadings-poor punctuation-run-on sentences-lack of examplesIt's difficult to read and more difficult to understand. I'm a straight 'A' student, a fast reader, fast learner, already familiar with auditing - and I can't follow this book. The best use for it is a doorstop.If I could give it a 0 star rating, I would."
4,Nice Remixes,"Based on the previous reviews here, along with the fact Sarah McLachlan collaborated, my expectations were quite high for this CD. While in some songs I was disappointed, in others I was pleased.Some of the songs that I have listened to over and over again so far are: Money changes everything, time after time, above the clouds, shine and waters edge. While others leave me annoyed at the new style- such as she bop and girls just wanna have fun (the version on her grtst. hits is MUCH better!). All through the night, I'm on the fence on, the song is good, but Shaggy sounds ridiculous.An added bonus to this cd was the dvd on the reverse side which had video's to Shine, Money and Above the Clouds. However, the ""behind the scenes"", are lackluster and full of nothing. Overall, the cd was worth the buy, for a Cyndi fan."
5,The Body Acoustic-Cyndi Lauper,This is an excellent CD from Cyndi. I think she is a talented song writer and she is a great slow song singer.Some of the songs really hit home and the instrumental is awesome.
2,Booby trapped with fault copy right protection.,"The album is great. It is a shame that Sony choose to load this album with such horrible copy right protection. After I noticed some fine print on the back of the dual disk CD that ""may not play on some CDs or DVDs"" I was told there was a compliant CD. Didn't note that there was yet more fine print about CP on this one as well. After placing in my CD player, it crashed autorun, hung explorer and dont even think about using ITunes. Then I see Mark's Sysinternals Blog with even more horror stories about what sony's softwear will do to you. So Im stuck with a very expensive coaster since I can't return it.Gee Sony, way to go making another happy customer. and this one actually tried to buy it!"
1,Very unhappy,They make these DVD/CD's dual disc to be heard on certain stereo equipment - I have not seen it yet or heard it - all I wanted to do is play the dam thing and I can't unless I put it on a DVD player which is okay but I haven't had the time for that yet - I just wanted to hear it on my stereo and I can't - so these smart people are selling their music to people in an older category (late 40's) and can't even hear it so I would say they are stupid if they think this is a smart thing.....
4,Texas Tess,"In this entry, Tess is GTT -- gone to Texas. This mystery plays out on the streets of San Antone and Austin to great comic effect. Having lived in both Texas and Baltimore, it is a special hoot to read about Tess's doings with the characters and the cuisine of the Lone Star State. Tess is a big strapping gal let loose in a big strapping state. Unfortunately, as with other Tess stories, the plot is a bit weak compared with the characters. That said, this is a very enjoyable read."
4,PETERIK IS JACK OF ALL TRADES ... AND GOOD AT IT !,"I MET JIM PETERIK ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO ... HE GAVE ME A SIGNED COPY OF HIS JUST RELEASED ""WORLD STAGE"" CD ...WHEN I TOLD HIM I REALLY LOVED HIS WORK IN SURVIVOR, HE WAS HUMBLE & APPRECIATIVE ... AND STATED HE FELT IT WAS A CREATIVELY RICH TIME FOR HIM AND THE BAND ... AFTER PLAYING THIS CD, YOU REALIZE JUST HOW MANY GREAT SONGS THEY DID ... AND IF YOU DID DEEPER ON SOME OF THEIR OTHER ALBUMS, THERE ARE SOME CLASSICS THAT STAND UP TO BE AS GOOD AS ANY ON THIS BEST OF COMPILATION. PETERIK WAS THE REAL TALENT IN THE BAND ... PARDON THE EXPRESSION, BUT JIMMY JAMESON WAS JUST GENERIC FLUFF & FILLER !!"
3,German Shephard NOT Wolf,"The music is beautiful and moving. Yet in the liner notes, he calls his friend Wastaoo a wolf. He also said he hears his bark. Well, wolves do not bark. Dogs bark. Wolves howl, wolves yipe, but I have never in all of my twenty some years of wolf studies have heard one bark or look so much like a white shephard. Oh and before I forget, orphaned, I don't think so."
3,its the 13th,"I give this 3 stars, because taken as part of a whole, this book ties up the loose ends from several books ago. As part of this last trilogy, it covers ground previously explored. This is not a book for a casual reader, but rather for someone who really enjoys Brian Lumley's fiction. Personally I prefer the earleir trilogy set on Sunside/Starside (Blood Brothers, Last Aerie, and Bloodwars)that this concluding trilogy. The earlier triology made better use of the heritage of Harry Keogh.Thsi book continues to make the human characters ""real"" and the vampires Things that Stoker and Rice have never dreamed of."
2,Quite annoyed by this product....,"Despite the fact that this is a great video, it's nothing compared to LIVE AT WEMBLEY '86. There are several tracks left out, some of them are the greatest in the Queen catalogue. And if there's one thing I can't stand, it's concert videos with tracks left out. What's the point? It's the same with THE FREDDIE MERCURY TRIBUTE CONCERT. Now I know that this is edited because I read somewhere that Def Leppard, one of the bands performing that night, played two of their own songs, Animal and Let's Get Rocked, as well as Now I'm Here. So it is something that I find really annoying."
5,Better Wembley Stadium Concert,"The best concert, in the most legendary place, with the best live musical group of all the times. definitively it is not possible to be lost. It is excellent!!!!"
5,the aging queens still rock,"this DVD isn't bad for four aging queens, freddie is in fine form, even though he had a bit more trouble with his voice than usual, but still put on a tremendous show, brian was equally brilliant, it's amazing how loved this band was in their home town. my fav bits are 'who wants to live forever,' 'impromtu' and 'a kind of magic,' actually the whole show is great. also check out a slightly younger queen on 'live at the bowl' and 'we will rock you' dvds, you will find freddie in even a stronger voice."
1,A real let down,"I have been waiting for a good Queen DVD for some time. This is not the one! The video levels go from normal, to way too high, the audio is poorly mixed and the singing sounds like it's going through a barrel. My copy frooze up several times and crashed my DVD player.Guess I'll have to keep waiting, or go with ""We Will Rock You"" which has some pretty positive reviews."
5,WARNING: DO NOT CONFUSE WITH THE BRAZILIAN DVD BOOTLEG,"Check some of the 1 star reviews for this DVD. It's not because it is bad, but because these people bought the wrong DVD.People please pay attention... The Official 'Queen Live at Wembley DVD' includes 2 Discs and shows Freddie on the cover kind of kneeling on one foot.The Brazilian bootleg has only one disc, it doesn't include the complete show and it has very poor audio and video quality. It's a pirate version and it shouldn't be sold in stores. Please be careful when you buy it."
1,Item not as pictured,This muffler is depicted with a single exhaust pipe but arrived with dual exhaust pipes. I wish that I had read the reviews I could have saved myself several weeks of waiting and the hassle of returning the product. I am unable to find any location within the technical specifications listed on the web page that describe the product as having dual exhaust. Additionally after describing the make and model of my truck Amazon indicated that this product would fit.
5,Pick along with Picker!,"As the illustrator of Picker McClikker, Stephen Hanson, the graphite and colored pencil style was inspired by the great Bill Peet. The fun challenge was illustrating Picker's lightning fast, tornado-like speed. Every little kid can be a Picker! Feel free to contact me through stephenhanson.com."
3,Horton's VC++ 2005,"I learned C from Ivor Horton and i liked his style.But this book is not good in my opinion for a few reasons.First half of the book is talk about standar t and and cli c++ but not in detail.Second half of the book is about MFC and WinForms but again i do not find them enough.It is very hard to follow the examples about MFC and WinForms and i couldnt manage to get to the end of them because of compiling errors and i was very bored.Putting all the things in just a book : ansi c++,c++/cli,databases,mfc,winforms is not useful at all."
4,Classic Zelda game,"Even without being part of the Zelda series, this game is a lot of fun. If you've played 'Link's Awakening' on the Gameboy, you will see that this game is very reminiscent of that one. You gain one special item in each successive Palace - something that has not changed as far as I know, fight bosses, and navigate your way through progressively more difficult dungeons/lairs. The nice thing is that this game provides a lot of backdrop compared to older installments of Zelda, and the graphics were really nice for that time, and still are today.There are a couple of parts of this game that are frustrating, but overall this game is really solid, and I've enjoyed it. If you're a Zelda fan, definitely check it out."
5,Gift for Granny,"This was wonderful. We bought it for my mother-in-law's birthday. She absolutely loves it. My kids thought it was awesome that ""Granny"" played this game and was loving it."
3,Caution Hemorrhoid Sufferers,"It certainly takes care of the colon, but if you have hemorrhoids, the phrase ""rubbing salt in the wound"" will come to mind. Vividly."
5,lots of fun!,I used this book as a guide for rock painting at a camp for ages 9-18. It went over so well that kids were painting rocks everyday at craft time. Even the adults loved it. The ideas in the book cover a range of difficulty from easy to moderate and include enough instruction for most anyone to grasp. We loved it.
1,THIS IS NOT AN ATOMIC WATCH,"I received this product in the mail today. When I opened the manual to learn how to use it, not once is their an explanation of how to use the Atomic timekeeping feature. I called CASIO direct to ask if this model was an atomic watch and they confirmed that it was not.BUYERS BEWARE!!!"
3,predictable light entertainment,"Cold Cold Heart has just everything - blood-thirsty mutiliations, rogue KGB defectors, FBI and CIA goons, a hard-bitten and disillusioned hero, AND a stunning beautiful Porsche-driving gun-toting ex-cop-turned-journalist sidekick.Though not breaking any new ground, Cold Cold Heart does what it sets out to do extremely well. It's gripping, fast paced and entertaining, and a cut above the average airport thriller.Mike Culley is very much like Lee Child's Jack Reacher character - if you like him, read this while you're waiting for the next Jack Reacher book."
1,terrible,"turned it off after 20 minutes. Joan Collins and her husband are annoying. even for a ""mockumentary"" it seemed pretty bad. i don't know if it was trying to be ironic or what but it was boring as all hell. first twenty minutes were Joan Collins sitting in their plush English country estate talking about nothing. go watch ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" instead."
5,These guys are gonna be huge!,You won't be able to stop singing the tunes and telling your friends. Don't miss out on any of their CD's... these guys rock!
5,So much insight and imagination,I was impressed with Boyden's depiction of how the Cree in northern Ontario have had to deal with the dominate culture over the last ninety years or so. I did not expect such a compelling understanding of what day-to-day life might have been like for two native Canadian soldiers during the trench warfare of the First World War. This story hits home for me in so many ways!
4,Book Club selection,"This is not a book that I would have picked up on my own. I only read it because it was my Book Club's pick for the month. It was a difficult read - I found myself struggling to get thruogh it at certain points, and it took me a while to get attached enough to the characters to want to find out what happened next.It is a sad story - it is about two Canadian Native American soldiers in World War I, one of whom is the nephew of an elderly Native American medicine woman. The story weaves back and forth through time and space - we hear the Auntie's story mixed in with the childhood memories of the soldiers mingled in with the battlescenes and one of the soldier's trip back home. But it all makes sense, in a morphine-induced sort of way.There are a couple unsavory scenes (one including a statute of the Virgin Mary and another a church altar) but this is a very well written book. This story will haunt you long after you're finished reading."
1,Wait till the fuse blows!,"When my bulb on top burnt out I replaced it with a good bulb and it still would not work. I opened the foot pedal and found a blown fuse that was soldered in place. I purchased from Radio Shack a fuse holder and replacement fuses. I unsoldered and removed the blown fuse and soldered in the fuse holder and installed a new fuse and the bulb worked again. Next time the fuse blows I will only have to open the fuse holder and replace the fuse and not use a soldering pen again.If you buy this, be sure to buy a soldering pen, fuse holder, and extra fuses."
2,The River didn't Run this time....,"Though a little Better than Soul Searching Sun, I feel LOA has sold out with this album. If I wanted to listen to a STP album, I would have bought one! I only really like 2 songs on the album and the rest are nothing special. Has Keith Caputo lost it? If you listen to every album chronologically, his voice gets different and more different to the point where it doesn't sound like him anymore. Yeah bands change their sound and evolve from time to time, but at least I can tell its them playing. WIth this record, it sounds nothing like them, and thats disappointing."
2,"Avoid if you can, unless you are Die-Hard fan like me","Life of Agony is one of the greatest bands to ever come out of NYC, but since Keith's rehab this band has just sunk to the same boring riffs and nothing inventive. Buy an older album like ""River Runs Red"" or the newer released old stuff ""1989-1999""."
3,More natural successor to Ugly,"After giving this album a quick run down, I must say it sounds like it the more natural follow up to Ugly. Like a lot of fans, Soul Searching Sun kind of turned me off to the band. I own Kieth's solo album and can appreciate it, but that's not really what I wanted from an LOA album. This feels much more natural for the guys. Simply put, it's a real good rock album. It actually reminds me of STP's Purple, both production similarities and song writing styles (which isn't a bad thing, I should add).All in all, if you dig Ugly , you'll probably like this album. A lot. Otherwise, it could be hit or miss for you. Either way, it's good to see the band back together and here's to hoping they keep up the good work."
4,Bram Stoker's Dracula rules,"First I had seen the movie, and Gary Oldman's performance was incredibly amazing.So was Winona Rider's. The book is great as well. I had recently read another Stokers book , also about vampires, and as far as Im concerned he is the best horror writer ever."
1,Don't buy if you actually want to move it.,"I am so frustrated with this product. I was using it to store files. When I went to move it, however, a wheel fell out. No problem. I'll just pop it back it. When I did this, another wheel fell out. When I replaced this wheel, a different wheel fell out. This process was repeated until one of the brackets holding the wheel snapped apart, making it unable to roll at all. I have just now thrown it in the trash. Save yourself some money and frustration and buy another product."
4,a primary text of 1920s Harlem,"In this year 2005, the 1920s may be utterly distant. Yet during that decade, there was a cultural flowering in the American Negro community. Centred at Harlem. Huggins takes us to that place and time. The narrative is enhanced by one key trait. This book was first published in 1971. The research that went into it was done in the late 60s. Several influential persons of 20s Harlem were still around and the text gives their direct experiences, from interviews with the author.In this way, Huggins provides a primary text for future students and historians. But given the 30 years that have elapsed since publication, that is who current readers are.The book shows how even with the severe strictures on Negroes throughout much of the US, a spirited culture could still arise and thrive."
3,Nude photography in a tiny apartment,"A small hardcover book (215x215x15mm) published by the Goliath Verlag and printed in Germany.Pages (about 160) are un-numbered and all pictures are monochrome.The opening of the book contains a small multilingual introduction by Reed Massengill briefly describing the photographer Peter Gorman and his work.All models depicted are female and in some of the photos the artist is visible either directly or via a tv-screen. However he's not nude in apartment 7 himself even if all the models are partially or completely undressed. Some of the models are present in several pictures(up to 15 photos of the same model.I find a big variation in the work. Some of the poses have a likness to views seen in adult magazines, some show definitively movement, and some have an abstract stillness to them.Several of the photos are very interesting and many are sadly not.The book was worth studying, but for me it is not a keeper."
2,Dull and boring,"Endless collection of the same photograph, same pose, and same lighting showing little imagination. On the positive side, probably makes a good reference book if you want to take your own photographs. The black and white format adds nothing and they should have been shot in color. Add 1.5 stars if you enjoy pictures of nude women and don't really care about the photography"
4,Pleasantly simple.,"I picked this up as a result of the glowing reviews, and was not disappointed. Water Clock is a simple, straight-up mystery and a well-written one at that. It will appeal to readers (like myself) who have less patience with the trend of producing ever more shocking serial killers instead of well-plotted characters. There are some minor uneven points (the pace is a little bit wrong), but they are more than made up for by the positive aspects. Give it a try!"
3,Sebxam,Its trult a shame that we can not enjoy some of these classic French gangster noir films without the benefit of ENGLISH sub titles
1,Are you kidding?,Don't pay any attention to 'Sleepless in San Franscisco'. This book is awful. I've read better instructions from my college roommate. She's not technical either! But at least she has an intelligent thought.Don't bother buying this drivel.
4,"cats like but not their fav, but cheaper than fav","My 2 kitties like this just fine and it is a $ saver for me. They like some of the higher priced items better, but good growth is good growth and one kittling went from 3lbs to 9 on a mix of the foods plus some wet. One went from 3 to 4 lbs. But the little one is only 4 months, so a pounds gain in one month is good. She is not so picky and loves the 9 lives just as well as the more expensive stuff. Maybe the answer is more young kitties who have yet to become finiky about what they eat. However, I will note that the favorite of both is baby food wet meat at 1.00 per 2.5 ounces. Stick with the 9 lives dry food."
5,Great HUB!,"This product works great and as stated. It handles all the devices I have hooked up to it, and I have ZERO problems! Kudos. Great price too!"
2,Cheap--in price and IN ACTIONS,This is a terrible hub. Your PC hangs all the time. Save your money and get something better like Entegra or whatever. This one is no good.
2,won't play on my computer,The copy protection on this cd prevents it from playing on my computer. Works fine in my car. However I can't move the music to my ipod. Bummer.
5,Awesome little bottle!,I bought this for my wife and she loves it! It is made very well and holds the perfect ammount of liquid. Has a screw off top with a large opening at the top to either drink directly from the bottle or pour into another cup. She takes Ice Tea to work every day in these bottles. She has the pink and the blue. I wish they had more colors of this bottle as we would buy them all no doubt. I give this 5 stars although my only complaint is that it is a little on the expensive side.
1,DREADFUL GAME,"Why do I rate this game 1 star? There are several reasons. First and foremost, there is NO SAVEPOINT. In short, you'll have to beat this game in ONE SITTING. Talk about patience. The second major problem that I have with this game is that it is trying to do too much. It is a top-down shooter AND a first-person shooter. The graphics in the top-down mode are fine, but the graphics and textures in FP mode are DREADFUL. Doom has FAR better variety, texture-wise. Personally, I got headaches after playing in FP mode after 30 minutes--and remember, you can't save. So the bottom line is this, if you want to kill dinosaurs, I'd recommend Jurassic Park for the old NES and the Carnivores series for PC. N64 has a Turok the Dinosaur Hunter series out. Pass this game, you'll be glad you did."
3,You have to be a real fan,"I read many good reviews on this, and I have to say that although I'm a huge fan, I can't get through this book. Maybe I'm not an artist, but I don't get it. I really want to, but I can't. I'm much happier with biographical books about Lennon."
3,Well Constructed,"Buy one size larger if you are an XL.7 oz is quite lite.Cotton is hard.Arm ribbing is not stretchy, and thin.Garmet has little stretch.Well made however.I have had better quality for less money from Wal Mart"
2,HUGE and scratchy,"These shirts are good quality. However, they are not true to size. My son always wears a mens large. The large I ordered is immense - more similar to a XXL. Also, the fabric is quite scratchy. I even machine washed it multiple times in an attempt to soften the material without luck. Even after several washes, the fabric was just as scratchy but the color didn't fade nor did the shirt shrink."
3,Polo Shirt,t has a ok fabric feel and and it is better than what it seems in the picture. I would recommend it to everyone.
1,Poor quality,"The shirt seemed one size too big when it arrived and after the first wash it shrunk over 6-8 inches in length. I only wore the shirt 4 times and it already has a inch sized hole under the armpit area.I was hoping that this would have worked out better because I need black polo shirts for work and this shirt wasn't nearly as expensive as some, but now I see why."
4,A Day with Wilbur Robinson,Wow! The book A Day with Wilbur Robinson is a fantastic book. The book is about a boy who visits Wilbur Robinson and his family in the future. I loved this book because it was funny when Wilbur and his friend are looking for his grandpa's teeth. In the end grandpa's teeth are found in a funny way. If you read the book you will know where they find his teeth. I recommend this book to anyone of any age because it is a good book and every age group will like it.
1,Just say no.,"I bought it, installed it, tried it, uninstalled it and returned it (of course I had to reformat my computer to get things back to the way I like them). Reviews say it was a big improvement. Maybe so, but I have no desire to learn a whole new way of doing things again. I spent years learning keyboard short cuts and putting up with a product I thought was inferior to WordPerfect (how I would love to have the reveal codes option for formatting).Be prepared for a steep learning curve. If you use word a lot and are proficient, you will find it very frustrating. Menus are different, key combinations are not all the same. You can customize it, but to be honest, I don't care.Between Vista and Office 2007, I think Microsoft has finally screwed the pooch. I'll stick with the old versions (XP and Office 2003) for now. My next computer will be a Mac running OS X and some sort of open office application. I have had enough."
1,Waste of Money,"Very disappointed in the sport that was provided to this product by the folks a Microsoft. This was promoted as the savior to my business contact needs -- yet it wouldn't even sync with my Blackberry unless I used a third party. For the price, I'd go find another content management system. There are lots of free ones out there that while they have their own limitations - are much better than this product."
2,Not so productive productive software.,"They did a few things right with this release. The new increased cell variation limit is one of those and the primary reason for our upgrade(7 systems all XPP SP3). Another welcome feature was threaded performance increases and the ability for several users to be updating a single document at the same time. We also like the new formula editor. However it now takes three extra clicks to do anything like inserting an image or setting a print area and that's after you know where it is. One user with dual monitors has Excel hang the system and crash daily. Performance in Outlook and Word appear to be the same but now with a clumsy user interface. All and all, if you have used office for a few years and 2K3 is working for you don't waste your money but this is still better than the free alternatives."
1,This alternator cost me money!,"I bought this alternator because it was one of the cheaper online. I had it installed for $178-because the ford focus has to have the engine mount removed and the engine jacked up in order to remove the alternator, not an easy job-It worked for maybe two hours before the battery light came on in the vehicle. The alternator worked all of an hour or two, causing me more money to repeat the whole removal/installation process again."
4,One Day in September,I thought that the book written by Simon Reeve was a powerful rememberance of an inexcuseable event. The background research for this book was exhausting and it certainly helped to clarify the calamity that has yet to be resolved. This is a must read.
3,ok but not as good as the othe dk countries,Dk country 3 is an ok platformer; but is nowhere neer as good as one or two. The worst part is the characters. For a seires called donkey Kong county; why is he only playable in one friggin game. Instead we get a baby Kong and Dixie Kong from the last game. Its ok but is abit harder and has a lazy story.
5,Had to get my hands on this one.,"I'm a long time SNES video game player, and pride myself in having a lot of the older games as they are my favorite. I have all the Donkey Kongs now that I have purchased this. I love it!"
3,It is ok,Well i guess it is ok. but it is not worth the amount i paid. there are only abouyt 5 pages in the user guild which dont help at all. there are like 500 options when all i want is to have no red eye and they dont have that. th doom is wayy too blurry and the door for the memory card is locked like fort knox. aside from the fact that its cute and white and little its no better than any other. i like hte sony cybershot ((which my best friend has)) 100x better.
1,Broekn and warranty not honored by Casio,"We've had this camera for 6 months. We loved it. Then the ring around the lens popped off after simply turning it on; it could not be reattached. The machinery inside was exposed. Casio took it back since it was under warranty, but, after we sent it to them, we were told that the lens ring was not covered. Even with their warranty in hand that stated everything (excluding the battery and power cord I believe) is covered, Casio insisted we pay nearly $200. In addition, we have been waiting 2 months to get the camera back (we still don't have it). We're so very frustrated. I would pursue them legally if I could justify the expense and effort. We are using the only alternative left to us of warning people about Casio's actions."
2,Easily broken zoom lens,"In my experience, this camera takes great pictures, but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily. It stops extending and just makes a clicking noise. This happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable. My brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their EX-S500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended. I would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate."
4,Gem of a Phone - But Delicate,"After going through half a dozen cameras in as many months, including a Sony and Canon, the Exilim turned out to be a great fit. The battery life is long, the sync with my computer was a breeze, and the LCD screen is bright and clear. The only weakness is that the digital zoom is not the best and the unit is fairly ""delicate"". I dropped the first one and the lens casing immediately cracked and I had to buy another."
3,It has a really nice beat to it. buy it now,This Artist is my music teacher mr joe Hurowitz. Buy his cd I really think this cd is good for a person who just started.
2,Looks used!,"If you like the washed out look this is the cap for you. if you want a true ""black"" cap, you need to look elsewhere.I did not like the way this cap felt on my head."
4,Great Hat,I have lots of these style hats that I've ordered over the years and this was felt very well made compared to my others. The adjustable allows for plenty of room and had no problem fitting my L/XL head size.
4,Review of Oxford's Menander,"This volume is an excellent collection of all, or almost all, of the known Menander. It includes his sole whole play, Didoskolos, many fragmentary plays, and also many doxai and apocrypha.The translation is fine, but it it's rarely funny. I feel the fault lies with the fragmentary nature of the subject, not with the translator. So many of the fragmentary plays feel like a collection of characters related in some confusing manner (someone's always in love) and interacting to some unknown end. Humour is occasional, not consistent.Also, the notation is sparse and at the end of the book. I've read other translations of Greek comedy that take great care to point out puns and double-entendres in the original text. This collection does so rarely."
5,A Wealth of Information!!,"This book offers great reading, works as a fairly comprehensive reference material, and as always, Peter's anecdote's add much color to the names, places and dates contained. There is a nice mini-biography on Hank Bowman, and plenty of other colorful characters from the world of outboard boat racing. Lots of great information on the motors and boats, too. If you're a fan of the 1950s outboard boat racing scene, this book is a MUST have! If you're a collector of old Mercury outboards, this book is a MUST have! If the sound of a pack of Mark 20H Mercs going into the first turn sends shivvers down your spine, then this book is a MUST have! Well worth the money! Get your wife to buy it for you for Christmas!"
2,Billy,"After reading comments from Billy Graham's staff,this was not approved by him. A lot of this was untrue and being a fan of his and interested in this story,that made me feel like I wasted my money ."
2,better read something else,"I finally read the book, bought it about 8 years ago, tried more than once to finish it. Finally got myself up to do so and was pretty disappointed. Boring, too far from any reality, characters unbelievable."
1,A Lemon,"I bought this vacuum because it was rated a best buy by Consumer Reports. From the beginning, it would shut off if I tried to vacuum a carpet with it. When I took it to Sears, they said there was nothing wrong with it. I took it back twice and they refused to fix it. The only thing I can do is throw it away. I just bought a Dyson DC 18 Slim and I love it!"
5,wow,still amazing came with my super so many years ago i think i was like 6 or something and now im 22 and i still play it its amazing
5,classic,"this is a classic game. if you don't love super mario brothers then your not human, 5 stars across the board!!"
4,So happy with my purchase!,I really am enjoying super mario. It brings me back and makes me happy :) Works like a charm and nice
1,crappy game,this game is too hard.to beat the game 100% is a real challenge.the graphics are the only good thing about this heap of rubish.
3,QC is lacking,"Just received these chisels, and was quite pleased with them initially, until I set up to hone and strop them. 2 of the chisels were nicked rather significantly (approx 0.125 mm and 0.25 mm nicks)at the cutting edge requiring grinding (rather than honing)to make the edge(s) suitable for use. A third chisel required re-grinding as well due to an out of square bevel. I expected to hone and strop---not to have to grind. Once the chisels were all dressed, honed and stropped the were impressively sharp and capable of shaving end grain oak easily. My feeling is that 50% of a new set of chisels should not have to be ground, regardless of price."
3,Nice but,"Arm warmers are attractive but don't stay up, have a tendency to slowly slide down arm. I bought large because that's what I wear in other warmers but these seem to fit ok but slide down."
4,The best cheap scanner available... maybe,"I have bought 3 of these for family and friends. I tried to buy another one for chrismas 2002 but office depot inexplicably cancled the order with no notice of why. The first 3 were bought direct from amazon.The scanner is kinda slow but does very good scans. HP has not improved their ability to write drivers or install programs butcannon and xerox are not any better. You will have a half dozen TSR's/systray items sucking up resources but the savvy user can use msconfig to trim the footprint when not in use. Can't beat it for the price, therefore I figure HP will quit making it pretty damn soon."
5,I love this soap!,"I love this bar, it lathers like no other. I love the lather it makes, great for shaving, nothing else I have used has come close. Works great at exfoliating without leaving a film or residue. Has a great scent. It is hard on the eyes though, but if you use the bar awhile your eyes get used to it."
1,Made my skin break out!,"I bought these and gave 3 to my sister and kept 3 for myself. Both of us had the same problem with breakouts after using this soap! The interesting thing is, we both have different skin types. I am prone to have more oily skin and she has neither dry nor oily skin. After using this soap my skin became incredibly oily and broken out. Her skin became dry and broken out. I'm not sure what is in these bars but it doesn't seem to jive with a lot of skin types from what I can tell. I threw mine away and got out another to use as hand soap in the bathroom. My guests hated it, too. So I wasted my money on 6 bars that got thrown out =/ Buy at your own risk I guess =/"
4,A good guide to Hungary,"As a Hungarian I was wondering if I'd get any new information from this book and being a curious person I bought it and must admit that it covers mostly everything that is worth seeing in Hungary.The introductory section is a bit obsolete though this is the most vulnerable part to changes. Anyway I laughed my head off at the description of Hungarian post officers and ""toilet aunties"". These descriptions are true and prepare the would-be tourist for what can be expected. The section is informative, covering all the important points.The chapter on Budapest is absolutely OK, the walking tours are managable and they cover the whole city. Once you've completed the 12 walking tours you know what Budapest is like. The other chapters are good, too, though the ones describing the Great Plain and Western Transdanubia could have been a bit more comprehensive.Considering everything this guide is a good choice if you want to visit Hungary."
3,What Happened??,"Seems like Bone Thugs are resorting to the trend of day- artists abandoning their original format to concentrate on making club bangers and radio play.. The sad thing is Bone Thugs's attempt to do so sux as the songs on the cd are not that good anyway. THIS is NOT the Bone Thugs we knew in Creepin Come up or E.1999. Most of the CD is full of tired R&B covers, and being a long time fan, I do not buy a Bone Thugs album to hear whats being played on the radio- I buy it to reminisce the original rap that erbody seems to avoid nowadays. With the exception of the title song- Thug Stories, The CD is unworth the money"
2,school nerd,"This book written by Gary Paulson is a below average comedy. The book is about two fourteen year old boys trying to earn their way out of geekhood and into the status of being cool. That is very hard when one of the boys, Gary, has alcoholic parents, and the other boy, Harold, is a strait A+ student who learns everything (including how to kiss) from a book. They go through everything from picking a fight with a bully, to buying a car while under aged at the age of fourteen. My favorite part was when they tried to learn how to ski. Harold tried to use his butt to slow down. All in all I give this book 3 out of 10 (one and a half stars) because it wasn't a book you could get into and ""never want to put down""."
4,alice review,This movie is good. I've seen 2 versions of it. I think the other one is better. This one doesn't have the Jabberwock. Versions with him are better.
5,A must read for Empaths,"In reading this novel, I have come to remember many many experiences that I myself have had with horses that at the time simply defied both explanation and on occasion belief. For the first time I have read an account of phenomenon that I have lived. For the last 20 years I have treasured memories that I did not feel I could share as I figured people would think me crazy. I am not, fortunately, and this book confirms and validates both the healing I found with these beasts of magnificent grace and beauty, and the love and acceptance that I found with them. I consider myself honored to have been recognized by them and trusted. I can not thank the author enough for all of the work that went into a project of this vast magnitude. There is not a single person who would not benefit from this book. It is a treasure, a vast gift. Thank you, Linda Kohanov."
3,romance or reality?,"This book provides a number of fascinating historical and mythological references. Beyond that, it decries logic in favor of an ""intuitive"" method of dealing with horses, then proceeds to logically substantiate that claim. Additionally, the eternal romaticization of anything equine undermines the author's ultimate goal of changing the lens we view our equine companions with."
4,"Relaxing, kick-back music",with the mood ranging from pensive to up-tempo. It is an entertaining trip. I am looking forward to hearing more from this artist.
3,specifications,The specification of which models are the one that fit on this case should be more specific
4,Serious self-defense for women,"Bradley Steiner has drawn on his extensive knowledge of karate, jujitsu, kung fu and military hand-to-hand combat and put together this self-defense course with techniques that are effective yet easy to learn. This is serious survival training, not dojo ballet. Also, the author gives a good deal of attention to the psychological preparation and mental attitude needed for effective self-defense against a dangerous attacker. The mindset is something many women have difficulty with, and it's as important as the skills."
5,Drinking in her voices,"I agree most of reviewers comments and am appreciated in her performance, I just add my personal comment on it for reference. Althought Hunt was famous of Irene role in Theodora, but in fact, signing the cantata of La Luvrezia is really her the most outstanding in this set, that's why I recommand this album more.She fully express this canatata lyric, moving sentiment toward me, and catch up my attention on music essence automatically, enjoying its beauty.I regret that Hunt wouldn't give us her Angel sound."
1,A very poor scanner; Very noisy and Poor photo scan quality,"When using the automatic document feeder, it produces document scans that are skewed slightly. HP technical support says this is normal. I find this completely unsatisfactory. You will not be able to produce accurate document scans.Do not purchase this scanner if you intend to scan photographs. The scan quality if very poor. Scans appear with no contrast and overly pixelated in dark areas of photo scans. The colors do not appear correct.The performance is also unsatisfactory. It is very slow and extremely noisy."
4,goog tape,I really liked this tape. It was easy to learn the dances from the tape. I would recommend this tape for everyone
2,GHD,It works well but needs to be level before all bolts are tightened. Not the greatest quality. Cautioned should be used during high intensity workouts so as not to break it.
3,"Medium Hardness, But lots of Fun","For those of you who like these Disney games, amust. You play as Aladdin. You're weapon inventory includes a sword and Throwing Apples. Comic Relief when you defeat some enemies."
1,Worthless,"I am very disappointed in this map. It is basically worthless. It is very crude, and grossly exagerates the waterways. You cannot distinguish rivers from lochs. And it does not include any of the railways! You can get better maps of Scotland from the Internet for free. Do not waste your money on this map."
1,Disappointed,"I couldn't be more disappointed. What is the 3001 for? Certainly not for the number of games. These CDs are just a come on to buy games from their online service. What a ripoff! The games that are on the CD are immature and boring.Delfina H.Albany, Oregon"
1,review,"this is super expensive for the item itself, and it is much smaller for two people you can buy the same quality at homedepot ar lowes for about $80.00 to $ 150.00 after you assembel the legs don't stay straight and the customer service from the seller is horrible."
2,Not real stainless,As soon as I got these I put them in the dishwasher. When they came out they already had rust on them. Enough said.
3,Painting,I bought this book for my wife. It is one of the many resources she has to improve her skills
5,Ebert at his best,"This thick book contains all of Ebert's reviews of movies released in the past year, as well as his weekly articles and his notes from attending film festivals such as Cannes. If you're a movie fan and would like a book to refer to when choosing videos, or want some scoop on the various festivals around the world, Ebert's yearbook (updated annually) should be what you need."
1,not good,"The Book totally skips from 1948-1962. As successful as Wooden was, he did have some failures. The book failed to mention them. I am a huge UCLA and WOoden fan, but the book needs to shed some light also on his failures as coaching. He was not a perfect coach. Bisheff is writing pretty much a biased book. I think he did cover Wooden very well, but left out over 20 years."
5,Soul Awakening!,"Reading the Starborne was like having my life validated...For so many years I felt so alone as if there was nobody else who could understand the seemingly strange occurances in my life. Always dismissed as having an over active imagination, I felt isolated and completely misunderstood. But reading Solara's words brought tears to my eyes in the realization that I in fact am NOT alone and that there are many who experience the same things. If you feel you come from another dimension, youll find great comfort in this book. Its truly Spirit on paper."
3,game system from the past,All is good....my son was wanting to play some of the older games on Sega Genesis. Fun to pull out game systems from the past. The adapter was hard to find in the stores....Thanks!
4,Misprint,It has a misprints in it and one page actually displayed twice in different section of the book. All in all it has nice pictures.
4,"Cats love it, partially destroyed it in 2 hours","The cats went berserk when they saw this. The first one that grabbed it growled to keep the other cat at bay. The furry ball leaves lint everywhere, and they completely detached it within a couple of hours, so I can't give it a higher rating than four stars. I should probably give it three stars, but they still play with it a lot and, for some reason, regularly deposit in in their water bowl."
2,No Suspense Whatsoever,"This is the first Alex Kava novel I've read. A friend loaned it to me. I don't know that I'll ever read another. The story was okay, but I didn't care one iota about any of the characters. There was no suspense. The reader knows exactly what is going on the whole time and since very little background was given, there was little connection to anyone. One review mentioned that two surprising things happened at the very end of the book. Well, that's true, I suppose. But after completing the book, I was left feeling, ""so what?""I have to say that I enjoyed all the dialogue. I don't get off on books that spend pages and pages on descriptions and inner-voice stuff. So in that regard, the storytelling was good. I just didn't care about anyone in it."
4,In Sync Motion,"There is no question that there have been lacks between analog & digital watches in the watchmaking world. That has shown with a huge lapse of distinctive quality in watches. But for Casio, whom had been strong with their G-Shock Watches, that actually seems to draw strongly in their favor. That shows brilliantly with their Street Reader watch. Not only is it easy to setup, but the hands on the watch fall in perfect sync with the digital watch in nothing flat. They move in stride, with each and every minute ticks down toward the next. I really like it. It handles very well from teenagers who've gone wild with Casio's G-Shock Watches, to the everyday office worker that has been looking for a nice convient watch, without all the hastles of those with perpetual calenders and overdosed doodads. I really suggest you give this Casio G300-2AV G-Shock watch, and see what you get in not just price, but striking percision.Price: BConvience: B+Comfort: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+"
4,Live is Best,"I have enjoyed Delbert McClinton for several years, but never heard a live recording of him until now. His vocals are harder and not as polished, but he is clearly energized by the crowd, and puts forth a great effort to entertain the live crowd. It really makes me want to catch him in concert. I highly recommend this album, which contains many tracks, almost all of them great, to anyone who has enjoyed his studio albums."
2,"Decent cup, except for the lid","The overall design of this mug is decent, but the lid is not spill proof, and the little latch part of the lid is very hard to open and often causes a spill when trying to do it with one hand."
1,Terrible Sound Quality,"I couldn't even listen to the whole concerto, the sound quality was so crackly and poor. I jumped at this download because of the low price and because I love Rachmaninoff, but my mistake was just reading the reviews and not listening to the samples myself. I won't make that mistake again. This recording was so poor that I deleted it from my iTunes library and wrote off the $3 as a loss. Very disappointed."
2,Such a drama queen...,"I've wanted to like Rufus. I've tried to like Rufus. I bought this just for ""Going to a Town""- an amazing song, and the lyrics are spot-on. But the rest of the disc is so melodramatic and off-the-charts narcissistic that I find it completely unlistenable. Rufus, can't you rein it in just a little bit?"
5,Ambitious undertaking,Remarkable book. My only complaint is that sometimes the details become overwhelming and the book loses its focus. That seems to be the product of its (maybe overly) ambitious scope. It bites off a lot but it also delivers a lot.
5,In Top Form,"I didn't know what to expect from this collection. I,ve always been a Bryan Adams fan and a live album collector. Live Live Live was great, Unplugged was weak. This one is unbelievable. Although Live Live Live was somewhat more rocking, this one shows Bryan and his two bandmates in top form in a more polished effort. Bryan has tended to mellow in his later years as have his peers but even the later ballads are brought back to life here. Musicianship is top notch and the sound quality is impeccable. I only wish the cd would have more closely mirrored the dvd. Clocking in at about 62 minutes, there certainly was room. I would reccomend this one be played loud!"
3,I expected more,"I went to one of his concert not too long ago and he was great! I was expecting the same quality when I bought this cd but, unfortunately it was not the case"
3,Accidental Mother,"Not the greatest book ever written--got it because my book club was reading it. I enjoyed the brit-speak, but there were a LOT of typos in the printing! The main character was bit scattered, except at work, and a little bit predictable. I like a little more depth to characters."
5,One of the best Halloween idea books I've seen.,"Maybe it's because I'm not a seamstress, or even a casual sewer, but I don't understand the objections of an earlier review. It's hard to believe we're talking about the same book! Yes, there is a costume using duct tape, but throughout the book I found many new, very original and creative ideas that I will be able to use for my annual Halloween extravaganza. I have read dozens and dozens of books on Halloween costumes, crafts, and decorating, and never been quite so inspired. As a Halloween afficionado, I recommend it highly!"
5,My new fave!,"Have pretty much tried all of the K-cup varieties available since getting our first Keurig machine about a year ago (we now have one in our weekend home as well) and this is my personal favorite - makes a nice bold cup of great-tasting coffee (particularly if you ""double brew"") that's now my first thing in the morning everyday brew! Might be a bit strong for some but great for those who like their coffee a bit stronger."
3,Little too strong for me,"Just me, it's just a little too strong, I prefer a lighter brand, just thought I woukld give these a go"
2,Bitter Taste,"This blend is bitter and does taste earthly like drinking mud? Really, it is the Wake Up blend is much better"
3,So-so,"Most reviewers seem to find this coffee to be the best ever or just horrid. I thought it was just ok. A bit of a bitter aftertaste if you ask me. It's pretty much the same as Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Wake Up Call, I can't tell the three apart. Interestingly, their Donut Shop is fantastic -- if you like Coffee People (and you can't beat the prices here on Amazon), I'd go for that one."
5,Raoring feel good wake up for boost for sure!,"I ordered this coffee because our staff requested a dark roast coffee. In particular,folks wanted something to help motivate and wake them up during early morning meetings because the flavored ones just didn't seen to have the punch in it needed for those early morning meetings. Well, this coffee was a hit and folks were purring and roaring and asking for me to order more. Great buy and great wake-me up!"
4,Great coffee,"Good coffee. Typically we like Diedrich French Roast coffee and we thought we'd try something new. Bold, but no bitter aftertaste - that's a plus. Sometimes, bold coffees are bitter, but this is smooth. Worth a try."
5,Good morning!,"This is a great cup of coffee to start your day. Strong, but not bitter. Smooth and tasty, and with enough kick to get you going in the morning."
4,Good Coffee,"I enjoyed this coffee. It was full flavored and very earthy. I didn't like this as my first cup of the day, but as a great follow-up or afternoon beverage. I prefer something a little more acidic when I wake up."
2,Compare before prchasing,"Maybe I am missing something, went to the manufacture website, $29.00 for the same quantity. Not sure why such a big price difference."
3,"With the exception of the Sandcrawler level, this game rocks.","This is definetly the start of something good. The two later Super Star Wars games were a lot more forgiving than this title, simply because the ""Inside the Sandcrawler"" stage is extremely difficult, due to difficult enemies and more difficult jumps ( it wouldn't surprise me if Luke's 'double jump' in the later games came after negative feedback here). If you manage to get past the sandcrawler stage, you're in for a very fun game, particularly when you're allowed to choose characters- Luke, Han or Chewie. Perversely, that Sandcrawler stage is the hardest in the game- and it's the 4th level! I recommend this game for the patient, skilled gamer."
3,"If you are a fan of Star Wars, this game is worth playing...","If you are looking for an entertaining and challenging game, try playing Super Empire Strikes Back. If you're not a fan of Star Wars, you should pass on this game. The game has a lot of levels, and there are passwords for each level so that you don't have to start at the beginning every time. The hard part is getting past the levels. This game is a lot more challenging than Super Star Wars. If you don't have a game genie, I would recommend buying one for this game. The game is frustrating because it's almost impossible to pass a level without dying. Except for that, the game is pretty entertaining. You can get the passwords for each level by going to ... . There are other sites where you can get the passwords too.So if you haven't played any of the Super Star Wars games, try playing this one after you've played Super Star Wars first. Super Star Wars is less challenging and you won't get as frustrated with it."
1,Disappointing,I expected a much deeper examination of the events of the crucifixion. Everything that was in this book is already known to every studious Christian. Very disappointing!
3,Tech Service,After having my DST3000 for about 1 month Direct TV sent some update and my receiver would no longer update the channel guide. After calling Toshiba several times they finally replaced it and now it works fine. Was very disapointed with their Tech support after reading the owners manual I knew more about the product than most of their support.
4,"Fun, light read","If you want a deep book this is not it . This is a fun, fast moving book that you won't want to put down and are sorry when it's finished. Read this book if you don't want to think, just enjoy. I love all Devon's book and this is no exception."
4,An historical civil war tale,"I recently read a novel about another woman from the same era inBand of Angels (Voices of the South).The prose of a black teacher from that time is different than the Robert Penn Warren romance, but the ideas of how people were treated in that time if they were thought of as being colored is similar.I had trouble starting this book, but once into it the novel is a pleasant and rapid read."
5,what it said,"it would do. basic ac adapter for a snes. works great, came complete in the box. good product."
5,my favorite french tech-house cd,i cant believe amazon left this cd off the funky french tech-house list. daft punk and air are crust. i-cube are bumpin! this is the cd you need to get.
4,Stylist Boombox that can play MP3s in Random Order,"There isn't many Boomboxes that even play MP3s (believe me, I've looked). This is the first that I've found that has the quality and features that you need with MP3 playback. It has Nice looks, decent sound, colorful back light, cute little remote, and most important of all it will play your hundreds of MP3s in a Random Order (which for some reason, is every Rare!). If you burn you own CDs than you probably know that you can get about 80 min of music on a regular CD (about 22 songs) and about 10 times that with MP3 format (about 13 hours and well over 200 songs). It not only lets you shuffle you songs but will recognize and let you select different folders of MP3s on you CD. So if you're looking for a nice CD/MP3 player in a Boombox with MP3 Shuffle...this is it!"
1,Broken and Dirty,The item arrived broken and dirty. Please give me an immediate refund and provide me with return information.
2,"Decent, but with one maddening omission","This product could've been great. It sounds good, it looks great, it's small, it's reasonably priced, and it plays MP3 CD's for hours and hours of music. What's not to like? Well, contrary to what the editorial review states, and contrary to what it states on Philips' web site, it DOES NOT have a headphone jack, for which I docked it two stars. It appeared to be the perfect product to set on my desk at work, but this omission meant that it was useless to me so I returned it. If you'll *always* use the speakers, then by all means get one. If there's a chance you'll want to use headphones, get something else.A headphone jack should be standard equipment on things like this, and it's really disappointing that it lacks this feature because it's such a nice product in all other ways."
5,the best!!!!!!!,"this is the BEST!!! i can take it every where, the sound is beautiful, and it looks so cool on my shelf. The remote is really gorgeous, it represents emotion.this is the best machinein my life!! (...)its sooo cool!! cool... cool!!!!!!!!!!! (...)"
2,Be aware,Be aware.The Philips AZ1155 is advertized on the Philips web site as having a 3.5mm headphone jack. It doesn't!The unit is advertised as being able to play any MP3 disc. It doesn't. The manual shipped with the unit states that discs recorded using DirectCD do not play in the unit.False advertisement all the way!
5,Excellent Troubleshooting by Paper Clips,"Paper Clips went beyond the everyday call of duty to solve the problem that I had with a file cabinet order from them. The problem was through no fault of their own, but they have solved the issue and made it easy for me to get what I wanted. I would not hesitate to order from them again and highly recommend them to anyone who is looking to order any office supplies. They were very professional in dealing with me and the short time frame in which I expected a response. Excellent customer service!"
1,this game did not do the movie justice,"I am huge fan of the Original Spawn movie, but this game just didn't cut it. they tried, but failed miserably. could have been amazing had they spent more time/money on it. oh well here's for hoping one day they make a great Spawn game(Soul Calibur doesn't count)."
4,A good upgrade,Seems like the most cost effective way to get Groove and OneNote. I could really have used Visio and Project as part of the package though...the pricing for Project has become frankly insane.
1,The Worst Puzzle Game Ever!!!!,"In this game, all you do is line up the colors and clear blocks using the color you, a triangle, have at the current time. If the blocks get to the square you are in, the game ends. Another thing that gets me is that this game lacks a 2-Player Mode. Do not even bother with this game."
2,Two or three real Funk superhits... The rest is not worth the price!,"Just to fill the gap in your collection of 70s Funk & Soul collection, specially if you're looking for their hits ""Stomp!"", ""Strawberry Letter 23"" and ""I'll Be Good To You"". The rest is pure 'stuffing' material.However the sound quality ot the CD is really good."
2,Not very happy.,"I was looking for 18/10 silverware for a gift for Christmas. I found this set for a great price and ordered 3 sets. When they arrived the box says 18/0. The weight of the silverware is not what I was looking for. I just came back online to verify that I ordered 18/10 and yes, thats what it says.Buyer beware."
1,Poor research,"I was intrigued by this book because of the glowing reports I read about it on several homeschooling websites. The entire text is available online, so I thought I would read a section to get a feel for how it is written. I chose a subject that I have done a great deal of research on, and was amazed that hardly a sentence in the entire section was correct. It was full of misinformation, long discredited theories and even character slander. I am very disappointed both in the book and in the websites that are recommending it."
3,Archos Car Charger,This is an important item for travel but remember that you have to also have the Battery Dock or the Mini Dock to use it.
1,this game is not worthy,"i didn't even know that this game existed until a few days ago, whilst searching on an 'associate's' selection of SNES games.it's horrible, annoying and was obviously nothing more than a quick cash in."
4,This book will draw you in.,"This thoughtfully plotted murder mystery, set in a small village in a remote area of England, seems slow-moving at first. The characters are country and small town people who speak simply. There are no car chases, no gunfights, not even a corpse. But the gathering momentum of the story draws you in. The protagonist, a young police officer determined both to do his duty and to be morally right, successfully prosecutes the local squire for murder. But all is not as it seems. The well-meaning detective has been led astray. Near the end of the book, he is presented with the shocking but morally defensible truth. Stick with this book; it will reward you.Michael Michaud, Vienna, Austria"
5,Talk about keep it in the family...,"This is my 3rd book from McDermid and not a Tony Hill novel...I have to say I felt like I was there in 1963 during that murder...it was so detailed and crisp and I'm not from the UK...the characters were so connected and didn't realize that this murder was going to change everybody lives after 35years...the twist is unbelievable and the way the whole Scardale family kept it together...amazing book...about to read ""The Grave Tattoo"", her books are extremely incredible...I love reading about a place I've always wanted to go ...I will get to see the UK one day...I totally recommend this book...you won't be disappointed..."
5,Masterful Mystery,"Val McDermind's story, ""A Place of Execution"" began a bit dry but quickly that changed. Her characters are well crafted and the sequence of events are masterfully designed. When I came to Part Two, the structure of her story was turned upside down. I wondered where she was going with the introduction of the character Catherine but, just as in the beginning, the story took off again. Once again she took the story and shook up the facts again to reveal another reality. So interesting to see how factual evidence can be seen in so many ways and that the truth, also can display itself in multiple ways. I look forward to her next novel."
3,Beware of spoilers,"If you come to this novel cold -- i.e. did not watch the television mini-series -- do not, I repeat, DO NOT read any of the rewievs below. Without meaning to, I'm certain, most of them contain a spoiler. This missing child crime drama, as well-written as it is, is quite simple in structure and it doesn't take a Hercule Poirot to guess the ""great secret."" I did around page 100 (in old-fashioned page count not Kindle ""location"") and if you read too many of the reviews you will too. And, trust me, that kind of ruins the author's intention."
4,a very good story but told in a too wordy way,"this book is about 150 to 200 pages too long. but the writing, the storyline, the plot, the scenario are all good, i mean, well, if you could stand trudging thru the long and slow space of the investigation and then you'd be awarded with the final bang of the buck! a very talented writer, didn't feel like reading a book written by a female, but the pace should be a bit faster, the sentences and paragraphs a bit shorter, but it's the typical english mystery style that almost all the good or bad english writers endowed and carried as one of the original sins and burdens. if they could make their tempos and paces faster, the sentence structures shorter and more concise, more concentrate, they're definitely far better writers than most american fellow writers who usually fall into shallowness, self righteous simple-minded, such as those murder in the congress, murder in the white house, m is for murder, b is for bullet (or bzzzxxxt?)..."
5,Skillfully written and Engrossing,This is one of the best crime novels that I have read recently. The characterization is spot on; the time and location make for a wonderful setting to a hideous crime. It all felt very real and almost ordinary - this type of crime could happen where you live.
2,Some supsense but plot full of holes,The book has a promising start and there are some good narrative sections. but the author loses her way through the twists of the story and (too)long 400 pages. The ending was not a total surprise to me and seemed just too soap operatic. But the most serious objection must be the plot which just wasn't credible. The question 'Why would a murderer...?' cropped up now and againstarting just after a few chapters.Yet the book has evidently been saved from something even more serious - in the author's introduction she states that she was saved by a friend from a serious flaw in the plot!I was really surprised to see the glowing review extracts from the critics and learn that the book was listed for the British Crime Writers Association's Gold Dagger Award as Best Novel of 1999. Thankfully it didn't win.
3,Well Written Book,"A Place of Execution is well written. Val McDermid was able to capture the atmosphere of a very, very small rural community. It moves a little slow at times. Maybe the first part should have been edited more. The second part of the book is at a faster pace. The character are well drawn and the plot is interesting. I would recommend this book. I rate this an A-"
1,Poor Quality,"I was very disappointed in this software program. I found it to be very poor quality and not as advertised on the website. My computer operates with Windows XP Professional. This software does not allow me to access many of the applications, because they only work with earlier versions of Windows. I would not recommend this product to anyone and would like to obtain a refund if possible."
1,disappointed Christian,The Print Shop software pulled up an error and would not load. The versions are old on the other software...very basic clip art and graphics. Sorry I bought...it's sitting in a corner on my desk.
1,Rip Off,Old software- made for windows 98. Low quality grafics. Will not install on XP or Vista without problems. Hard to use and navigate. I do not recomend it.
1,Garbage,"this is the worst death metal album ever. Weak production, (bad) lyrics, and completely boring music. I am amazed that anyone wouldn't throw this away after hearing it. There is absolutely nothing on here that i hadn't heard a thousand times before. For death metal in the same style thats actually good, pick up the new Skinless.And come on, everybody knows rap music is garbage and for people of diminutive intelligence. But then again so is Korn and the Backdoor Boys, and theyre selling millions.I guess this is the death metal crossover album for high school jocks."
2,Nothing But Platitudes,"The book is separated into chapters on various values that Bill Bradley considers important in basketball, such as ""Respect"" and ""Leadership."" The values are then illustrated by examples of players exhibiting these values (not infrequently, the player is Bill Bradley himself). Unfortunately, the book is filled with turgid writing and platitudes such as ""Some of the very best basketball players, through their athletic accomplishments, legitimize youthful aspirations and encourage committment."" I've read several books by Bradley and know he is a good writer who, although sometimes a little dull, is usually insightful. This book is a big disappointment. It might be helpful to children or adolescents who are first starting to play basketball but if you're an adult looking for insight into the game, look elsewhere."
3,Gets broken from its bearings,"Dear Everybody,This high-quality wireless headphone,despite its high sound quality,gets broken from its bearings when trying to put on the head after 1.5 year of usage,at least that's what I've experienced.The joints are not long-lasting.Please consider this.Regards."
1,A frustrated user considering linux or going back for a bite of the Apple,more bugs in this piece of software than a cloud of locusts.Maybe Steve Ballmer should focus on fixing the problems in Vista and Office 2007 rather than pursuing mergers!
3,OFFICE,"This is an enterprise version, was not able to register one note , to many keys submitted...seller never got back to me after I wrote Amazon suspecting it was piracy... so beware, for the price, works fine, can't imagine if i have to reinstall, probably wont be able."
2,Ultimate Office,"The new interface displays a lot of things I rarely, if ever, use. The tabs separate actions I use together such as converting text to a table and vice versa. Some keystroke sequences I regularly used with the earlier version no longer work the same way such as Alt-W and a number to switch windows. On the plus side I do like the preview feature, but overall the menu area is way too busy."
2,Don't work very well.,I was looking for a different brand that was out of stock everywhere I looked online so I thought I would try these. Did not work for me.
3,Kings X - Average Album From The Band,"Not one of my favorite Kings X discs, ""Manic Moonlight"" is still a decent effort from the band. This one seems to really be Doug Pinnick's baby. He sings lead on all of the tracks and although individual writing credits are not given the majority of the songs at lease sound like they were written by Pinnick. The album is low down a funky and features the great musicianship that Kings X fans have come to expect. Overall I would not rate the songwriting on this album quite up their with the band's best efforts however. Highlights include the title track ""Manic Moonlight"", the band's trademark vocal harmony effort ""False Alarm"", ""Vegetable"", and ""Skeptical Winds"". Overall this is a decent Kings X release, but in my opinion is not one of the band's best."
2,The drum loop album,"Well, it must be hard and possibly boring to be in the same band for over 10 years, so a freebie will be issued to the legends on this one. Known as the drum loop record in King's X circles, this was the album they had to make to satisfy their need to be experimental, cutting-edge, and just flat out do something different. Nothing really grabs ahold of you on this one besides the tradmark vocals King's X is known for. One surprising note is that the songs on this albums translated nicely live on the tour to support this album.Catch these guys live in concert if you ever get the chance, they are incredible live."
4,Thier mot mature yet,"This is probably both thier hardest and most mature work to date. Thier usage of simple melodies and solid rhythms mark a firm departure from thier earlier recordings in which nuanced complexity seemed to mark the norm. Not as if that was a bad thing, but, in scaling back thier approach, they allow the strength of thier songwriting to shine on its own. Alll of the tracks on this recording work, and the usage of loops is kept to a bare minimum, which, in this case is good; too many of Bill Laswell's loops could have spoiled things."
1,Please Come Home Kings X,"I tried and tried to like this album, but couldn't help hating (most of) it. A big disappointment from my favorite band ever. Manic Moonlight was followed by Black Like Sunday, and those two albums in a row were enough to make me stop paying attention. Hopefully Kings X will one day come home to making more of the music that I still get lost in sometimes."
4,They Still Got It!!!,"King's X is one of the most respected musicians to come along since the Beatles and Rush graced the musical landscape. Their sound has gone through changes throughout the years, but they still got what it takes. While I consider this release one of the weaker ones in their entire set, it is still very good and worth listening to. The first song ""Believe"" is my favorite and ""Vegetable"" seems to a song every fan likes. ""False Alarm"" is another favorite of mine. Doug Pinnick and I seem to always be going through the same things in life - based on his lyrics. Another classic CD in the King's X collection..."
1,Not very good,"I stopped buying King's X cd's after this one. I'll still go see them play live but I don't get excited about their new releases.In my opinion this band peaked with ""Dogman""."
4,King's X -dominant force in music,While King's X remains the most underated band in music history they continue to supply the world with original guitar driven sounds that absolutely kill. Melodic vocals and intelligent beats complete Ty's awesome guitar work. The only reason why this record gets 4 stars is because their previous efforts were tremendous. Get this record if you like hard edged bass/guitar riffs with intelligent and melodic vocals and a killer drummer who knows how to keep time through complicated changes.. Good Luck To King's X in the future and thanks for all the music
2,3 Good songs,"Believe, Vegetable, and Jenna are good songs. Most of the others are tolerable (except Skeptical Winds which is actually ok the first time you listen to it but grows old VERY fast). And the last track isn't even a song. I thought Mr. Bulbous was a pretty good album, but not great. I listened to this one several times and went back to Bulbous and this one made me realize how good Bulbous was. They went in a new direction with this album, but didn't spend the time (just a matter of weeks) to get good at writing/performing this type of music. The drum loops are really lame and just copied off of some Sound Forge CDs. Also, the production is very sloppy (again, becase they didn't spend the time). This band used to seem like perfectionists and now they are acting like they think they are a high school garage band. If they continue in this direction (and don't get good at it) then I think I will stop following this band."
4,"Good, but simple.","I think that this movie, (as was previously written) simply couldn't shake the ""Lifetime"" feel. It was a good plot, had decent actors and actresses, but something stunted it's relate-ability. It seems like a movie that you watch on the couch with a tub of ice cream and say, ""How sad for them..."" instead of ""OH MY GOD!?!?."""
5,Good camera for all purpose,"Ok, I have read all the reviews. I lost this camera while bike riding in Shanghai. I was shooting while riding and put it wrongly back in the front basket and lost it someplace. Now I am getting a new one, exactly the same from Amazon. I took some good little movies with it too. it is truly point and shoot.Here is what I had to have in a digital camera: compact, viewfinder, AA batteries, good screen size, good pixel rating, not a disaster if lost. I travel alot. I lose and break cameras regularly. This is the only camera that had what I needed. Yes, the Coolpix 4 was almost perfect, but no viewfinder, which is a must for me... much faster to aim and shoot (for me). I don't see how others could bad review this camera... oh well."
4,A very good deal,"My previous camera was a Pentax S30. It fell from 3 feet (while in its case) and stopped functioning!I bought this Casio because it has a viewfinder (a very useful, disappearing feature), had good reviews, uses ordinary batteries, is relatively good looking and was quite a good deal. Pictures quality and response speed are good (the Pentax is quite slow).Cons: Memory card compartment is poorly designed (difficult to remove the card) and the covers for both the card and the USB are flimsy and ugly.Also, there is plenty of unused space at the back so why not bigger display??Bottom line: A very good camera."
3,Demo Review,"My review is based on playing the demo version on the Dreamcast Magazine sampler disc. It features a bomb-disposal mission, but you can just explore the city if you'd rather do that. You can also play it as a demolition game; the cars and some scenery is descructible, you score dollar-denominated points for destroying them. There are 4 playable cars in the demo version; an italian sportscar, a little german car, a circa 1950's american pick-up truck, and an mped scooter. (The scooter is indescructible; a good choice for demolition play). I enjoyed the demo so much I am going to buy the game."
2,Well... it's Bruce Lee...,"..but that's about it. The game sucked. The controls were unresponsive and the gameplay just blew. Pressing the same button combination would result in different techniques depending on your positioning of the character.The only reason I give it two stars is because it does somewhat follow the movie and it does deliver a Bruce Lee character. Aside from that though, it delivers nothing worth getting into."
4,Good Coffee,I try to purchase all different flavors since I do like the different tastes but this one is a little mild for me not alot of flavor kind of blah.
2,"The Reader Ruins It (review of Stefan Rudnicki reading, not the content)","Hated the reader of this book. Sounded like a kid, and constantly misprounced ""pictures"" as ""pitchers."" And there were a lot of ""pitchers"" in this book.The reader of a book is infinitely important. This is obvious when you listen to Jonathan Marosz reading the first several Myron Bolitar books, then hear the readers they use after Marosz retired. Unlistenable.And the readers of Jack Reacher and Lucas Davenport - after hearing those, I can't believe the weak readers who do the Spenser novels.Just totally disappointing."
4,My daughters favorite,My daughter fell in love with this in Macy's. She asked for it for several months. It was one of her favorite Christmas presents this year. Pretty bottle and she loves the fragrance.
2,Not Microwavable????,I was a bit disappointed to find that these bowls were not microwavable. I gave them as a gift and did not see anything on the product description that stated that.
4,My little one loves it,"My little one is two. She really doesn't understand how to implement what they are talking about from the video, though she likes it and knows the words and dances to all the songs. Very entertaining."
2,Haven'nt noticed a difference.,Ihave not really noticed a difference in my dog's ability to get up off the floor from a lying position. This is usually her hardest struggle so that is how I gauge any product for arthritis of the hips. She has only been on it for about 4 weeks but very reluctant to reorder due to cost and questionable results.
5,THE MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,IF YOUVE SEEN THE FIRST ONE AND THE SECOND ONE....WHERES THE THIRD. I CANT WAIT I LOVE THIS GUY. HE IS THE MAN. POINT BLANK.
5,One of the BEST Shows ever!!!,"House is one of the best series I've ever watched. It has enough medical intelligence to keep your interest like CSI. But the character of Dr. House is hilarious! His dislike, distrust and disgust with the majority of the human race, believe it or not can be quite funny. He says things and does things that many of us ""think"" but wouldn't dare. Watching someone do it and get away with it (sometimes) is quite entertaining!"
5,House is welcome in my house!,"I'm a big fan of ""House,"" and I had seen most of these when they were first aired. I bought this collection so I could watch the episodes whenever I choose. The extras are okay, but nothing special (the bloopers is probably the best). If you like ""House,"" you'll like this collection. If not, don't buy it."
5,A good-looking man with only one redeeming quality...,"They said Hugh Laurie nailed this character in his screen test, and they were right (he wouldn't have landed it with his own English accent!). House is a good-looking yet selfish and demanding guy who has only one redeeming quality: he saves people's lives. The writing and research for the show are incredibly well done as is the acting by all involved. It's also great to see Robert Sean Leonard in a role that spans the widest range of acting abilities, from playing the tender, straight-and-narrow guy to the naive schmuck seemingly starved for House's friendship and becoming the butt of House's ""practical jokes"". Here's hoping for a long run! ~ Natasha"
5,House fan,"I love all of the house shows, this season was not as good as the last but it still was very good"
3,OK box set,"Like the first season box set, the video quality could be better, and the box set itself does not really have anything special about it that stands out."
5,House M.D. Season two,"Let me first say that I have never been so involved in a show before. I like CSI and stuff like that, House is the first show that I have to catch every episode or I Tivo it. :) Anyway I would highly suggest this dvd set to anyone who likes ER, Third Watch (canceled) and even CSI. I praise FOX (or whoever makes the dvds) for not making this season's dvds double sided like the ones from season 1. THIS SHOW IS AWESOME!"
3,Double sided again?,"Once again the money saving bug bit the DVD maker in the booty! I highly recommend to anyone purchasing any type of double sided DVD to make copies of it first, not for resale of course. As for the quality and hours of entertainment from them, pricless."
3,Show great,I gave this a mid review not for the show but for the fact that 3 of the disc hubs were broken. This makes opening and closeing the set a pain. you have to be caeful not to damage the discs
3,"Still good, but needs to move forward","This was so very, very riveting in series 1, but it is becoming predictable and stagnant. Hugh Lawrie says that in his view TV lead characters stay stable while the characters around them change, and in cinema the reverse happens. I think this series needs the main character to move on (romance?) or else it will peter out soon."
4,A very interesting listening,"Gilgamesh was a great story to listen to mainly due to the interesting plot and the events that happen. It is almost surreal listening to this story about the very strong Gilgamesh and his newly acquired friend Enkidu. The story is intriguing throughout the adventures that Gilgamesh takes to complete himself. So intriguing and interesting that it is hard to think of how old this story really is. The only thing that immediately seems different about this story is the repetition that was used in the writing. At some points this seems to come back many times, with a slightly different happening each time. Overall this is a great story to listen to or read, giving you a look at ancient Sumerian life, and the stories they told."
3,It's okay ...,"I agree with a previous reviewer from two years ago that I'm really not interested in a prose translation of Gilgamesh. While I found the Introduction interesting, the translation itself is disappointing considering there's really no need to have your own interpretation of what the missing tablets *might* have said (and I can only speak for myself).There are definitely better translations on the market. I would recommend using this book for the informative background in the Introduction, but to use this book in and of itself for a class, or for your own reading, is really missing out on this epic.The best reading of this epic, for me, has been a few online translations that are literal and do not attempt to fill in the missing tablets. - Donna Di Giacomo"
5,big improvement,"I just threw out a book by Andrew George, a translation of ""Gilgamesh"". Horrid. I am no literary critic but I hated it. I have begun a new translation of the same book by Stephen Mitchell. It is far superior to George's. Its prose is powerful and in places beautiful. When you read a translation you are a blind man depending on a description of the world by the sighted. Being at the mercy of the translater is the same. I have read translations of the ""Iliad"" which put me to sleep. This translation of ""Giglamesh"" by Mr Mitchell, has produced a fine book containing much beauty of near poetry. Well worth the time to read this very old story, which itself is timeless."
5,epic wonder,"not only the oldest, but one of the best stories ever told. gorgeous translation, and an unusual but compelling narrator. i never get tired of this production."
4,Curious,"I had never read Gilgamesh in college, so I bought the book to fill in this gap in my liberal arts education. I approached the text with trepidation, thinking I'd have to wade through it. Quite the contrary, the narrative moved smartly and the lanugage (a contemporary translation) had none of the stiffness of many classic translations of Greek plays and Roman histories. I enjoyed the story.One caveat. The introduction is an interpretation and recapitulation of the whole story. It's worth reading, but only after you read the text. Bring your own sensibility to the story. Then test your take against the translator's."
2,"It was Boring Back Then, and It is Still Boring Now.","I never got into the hype of Mortal Kombat when it came out in arcades; it was good on arcade while the game lasted and then shipped to SEGA and SNES. Playing it on SNES was pretty boring for me for three reasons. One was the lack of blood. It was probably the most interesting feature of the arcade game. Two was the controller problem. I could never get a lot of moves done the way I asked for. Three was the sheer boredom of it. The game is very one dimensional for me. There is not much to do except memorize the combo moves for each player and then the fatality move. After them, there is nothing else anymore. The tournament is interesting, but once the ladder is climbed to the top, that's it. There isn't much to be said. All in all, Mortal Kombat doesn't cut it for me."
4,Classic,"While this game was simple compared to future Mortal Kombat games, it served as a good precursor, much like the first installment of Final Fantasy, Mario Bros, Legend of Zelda, etc etc. So give it a try if you're a Mortal Kombat fan and get a taste of the old school!"
4,Good floater good price,It does accumulate teeth marks easily but it's econonmical to buy several. Floats nicely to allow the dog time to get to the long throws.
1,Hyperflite K-10 disc,Lasted one session with my GSD. His teeth punctured the disk on the first throw. Not recommended for large dogs.
3,Too early to comment,It is too early to say anything about the plan I haven't claimed any or spoken to customer service and hoping that the customer service is good.
4,EXCELENTE VÍDEO JUEGO,"EXCELENTE VÍDEO JUEGO A MI HIJO LE GUSTO UNA BARBARIDAD; SE LOS RECOMIENDO ABIERTAMENTE; ORIGINAL FUNCIONA PERFECTAMENTE, ES MUY BUENO"
5,Nephew loves it!,I bought this for my nephew and he loves it. He tells me that it's his favorite game of all.
1,Didn't get past a few missions,"I recently bought 2 NEW psp 3000 consoles a few games with vice city stories and I didn't get to play past a few missions before I couldn't even play them game anymore.I deleted any other gta games on my memory card and some other games.I thought it was because of that.I put the disc in and it won't play.I've restarted my system,let it load for a LONG time and still WON'T play.I've been a fan of the GTA series and doubt I will play it anymore!I tried the disc on both my psp's,none of them will play it.I don't want to dish out more money to return it.I'm very unsatisfied!"
3,If Rock and Roll were a machine,"I am a huge Terry Davis Fan; I had the honor of knowing him and his work while a student at Mankato State (mankato, mn). This book appealed to me bacause I am a motorcycle rider and a product of 70's and 80's arena rock and roll. Davis has a way with ""tortured"" young men's voices that make them real and accessable--even to a woman; if you've not read his seminal work Vision Quest--for shame. I like that there is always an inanimate object or concept attached to the evolution of each young man in the book. I recommend him for young adult readers struggling with growing up and thinking their parents ""suck"" and life is unfair. Try Davis's friend Chris Crutcher too for similar ""boy"" books with a bite and good plot."
1,Running in circles,"I did not buy this at Amazon (surprisingly, because I am a regular and love using Amazon). I figured this would be a cheap way to maintain directions when exploring area lakes. I mounted this on my boat. Looked ok. Seemed to maintain proper direction. Then I started the engine. The compass started spinning in circles and did not stop until I stopped my engine. I took it back."
5,Coolness,"this game is really cool. i suggest this game to anybody who ever watched it. even though the gameplay is different from the way ultraman actually battled, it still has some of the most hilarious sound fx and background music ever. if you want a cheap, cool fighting game for snes, get this. trust me, if you suck at this game, you'll at least be able to laugh at the sounds you make when you karate chop and kick. chu! chu! and again the musical score will get your laughs as it is sensationally dramatic. buy it, i have owned this game since i was about 10 and would reccomend it to anybody."
3,Mostly how to build. Not so much tune.,"If you have a new Holley carb that you want to to tune for your application, this book is not for you.On the other hand, if you have a bunch of Holley parts that you want build a good working carb from, this book is for you."
3,For the Faroes get LP's Scandinavian Europe book instead,"The LP Iceland, Greenland and Faroes book reviewed here is now outdated. It has been superseded by specific books on Greenland and on Iceland while if you're looking for the latest practical info on the Faroe Islands you'll now need to buy the Scandinavian Europe book. Although that doesn't have a huge coverage of the islands, it should be fine for a one-week trip - indeed the Bradt Faroes book is by comparison almost over detailed with stuff that's of little real help while the Bradt town maps have some serious errors."
1,DOA,"We ordered this TV on November 18th. Out of the box it displayed nothing but brightly colored lights. We tried to resolve the issue, calling customer service and checking on-line help etc. After days and days of frustration with customer service, they insisted we send them digital photos of what the TV display looked like, I guess they didnt believe what we were telling them. We sent pictures, and after we nagged them relentlessly for several MORE days they agreed to have the TV serviced. Several days after that a local TV repair shop called to make an appointment, and we assumed they would actually fix the TV since we were also told a board would be sent to them. All they did was take the TV back to their shop, they'll be in touch in a ""few days"". Here it is a month later and we still dont have a working TV. What a disappointment all the way around."
5,Great quality filter!,Been buying Baldwin filters for years! Great quality filter for the money! Love the combination of Amazon.com and Baldwin filters!
2,misinformed,"I read up on this product and thought it was for regrowth on the hairline but i only realized after i bought it for a friend that this product is strictly for hair loss in the center of the head, so it didnt apply to us."
4,Rogaine for Men,"My dermatologist recommended I (a female) use Rogaine for Men due to my hair loss and thinning hair. I've been using it 2x daily since mid-July. Although my hair loss has slowed and new hair is growing in, I can't say for sure if it's due to Rogaine. I've subsequently started taking a thyroid prescription and can expect another 6 months of hair loss due to this condition. The Rogaine should be applied directly to the scalp, then rubbed in with a finger, trying to avoid getting it on too much hair. When it's gotten on my hair it dries and feels sticky and gritty. It changes the texture of my hair and my hair tends to look greasy with the Rogaine. However, I am determined to continue using it for another few months since every doctor I ask does recommend it."
3,seekingforhelp,This product doesn't seemed works for me and it got worst. I got shedded more hair than ever so i have to stop using it after 2 months.
1,Do not buy this book!!!!,This is the worst instruction manual I have ever read. It makes things way more complicated than need be. The pictures are useless and the format of the book is ridiculously slow. A reader does not even learn how to open a new file until CHAPTER 3!!!Dreamweaver is an extremely intuitive program I was able to put up a simple website only after I PUT THE BOOK DOWN and started experimenting with the program itself. Bottom line: this book is a total waste of money.
4,Interesting Effects When Colored,"My only complaint is that there is some slight ""bleed thru"" when coloring the pictures with markers. However, coloring with pencils or crayons presents no problem. If you have access to a copier and want to keep your books pristine, copy off the page you wish to color...and no, that's not intended to say, ""Commit copyright infringement""...lol."
1,Flexall,"Product was only 7% menthol - my mistake. Also, product was sent twice. I requested an authorization for return and never got it. I did get a refund for the duplicate item received."
4,good deal,"Amazon has great deal for the casio g-shock series.The mudman watch looks sterdy and durable.I got them for one of my friend, i hope he will like it."
5,Great Watch,"Excellent watch: rugged, easy to use, great funtionality. Looks cool too.In addition to this Mudman, I have two other G shock models that are significantly older, they still work great and I still wear them. They've been all over the world with me working in oilfield services.Also, this was an especially good price on Amazon, no way I could resist it."
4,"Mudman, yes. Amazon, no.","I just got this watch so I don't know how well it will hold up but it seems to be very well made and sturdy. I was worried that it would be too big for my wrist but it looks fine. Big, but not ridiculous looking.I am totally disappointed with Amazon though. I paid for shipping and the watch still took longer than their estimate. When it got here it looked like it was a return. The packaging was beat up and there were no tags on the watch. I think it is fine but I expect this sort of thing from Ebay, not Amazon."
4,Nice Watch!,I like it! Great Light! Buttons are hard to push as reviews stated. Very hard. These are super tough watches! Great Amazon Price and Great Watch!
4,very pleased,"I received my Mudman this week and so far I have to say I'm very pleased. The face is smaller than I thought and not as thick as I thought it would be. No problems with the buttons (I like that they are stiff), quick to set up and band is pretty comfortable. I wish they had this model in a ""atomic clock"" version without the solar battery. I haven't meet anyone with a real good experience with the solar battery, so that is why I returned my GW500A-V1 to get this watch. I really liked the looks and atomic clock feature of the GW500A, but I did not like the solar battery and the lack of countdown timer which I use daily. I would definitely recommend this watch to a friend."
1,not impressed,"This shampoo *really* dried out my hair. I was really looking forward to using it, because I avoid sulfates in beauty products and I'd heard good things about this; unfortunately, I couldn't even finish the bottle."
5,Three good movies for the price of one,"Well worth the price of admission. All three movies are good. 15 minutes is a very dark crime thriller. Frequency is a wonderful time travel type of story, with a twist."
5,Caprica,"Caprica is brilliantly written, produced and directed. It is a many-faceted, multi-generational, story about two families that suffer the loss of family members. It is drama in a science fiction setting, with great special effects. The characters are fascinating, complex individuals who struggle to cope with the deaths of daughters and a wife. Joseph Adama, played by the very talented Esai Morales, lost his wife and daughter; Daniel and Amanda Greystone,played by Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson, lost their only daughter. The lives of the two families become entertwined as they seek to make sense of the tragedy. A must see for people who truly love a good, meaty drama."
1,shame on Amazon,"I ordered this based on the 3 minute clip, but I don't understand how anyone can be exoected to rate or review a DVD they haven't seen yet. But shame on Amazon for omitting co-star Esai Morales from their summary while naming lesser characters, including one who was edited out of the final cut! My one-star rating is for Amazon, not for Caprica."
3,BSG prequel but not the same,"The movie is not as action-packed as I would like for BSG prequel. They spend most of the movie talking. It's not the same as the talking they do on BSG.Many of the scenes I thought were excessive and largely unnecessary. I didn't need to see the many scenes of gratuitousness frontal nudity and implied sex.They hint on the conflicts of the colonies (the 12 planets), but I would like more. Second, I felt the main characters could have been developed more.If they cut most of the nude scenes and added more character conflicts, it'd be 4 star movie. However, since they spend too much time talking, it's a 3 star movie."
1,Gratuitous,"While the mytharc is engaging, the gratuitous violence and sex left an extremely harsh taste. It makes me wish I had never seen it."
2,"Some interesting moments, but too lugubrious","I've only seen the new Galactica series a few times. When I did see it I found it to be intriguing, if a little bit too serious and somber for my taste. But there was definitely a reason for that series to be depressing, so I thought Caprica, set in a time of peace, would be different. But even so, the creative team has found a way to make it depressing from the outset. A little humor would have helped to make this a little more palatable.I was turned off by the anti-religious tone. All ""monotheists"" are lumped together and set apart as extremists or terrorists.I also thought that the acting was a little wooden. For such a serious show the cast seemed to have difficulty expressing a wide range of emotions. In particular I expected better from Eric Stoltz. But maybe the cast was depressed by the script.While there are some interesting moments and good special effects, it's not enough to outweigh the negatives."
5,More than I expected,One can only hope the followup series is as well done. This is a well thought out movie that begins to tell us of the eventual fate of the 12 Colonies. When I saw Esai Morales on the screen I knew good things were to come. The intro of the characters was first rate and complete. I have watched the movie 3 times and still picking up fine points. Ron and David have scored again.
4,I've captured a lot of good times with this camera.,"I bought it because it was small, didn't need extra batteries, and looked cool. Of course that means I had to sacrifice some in terms of picture quality, but thats okay. I don't ever plan on getting prints bigger then standard 3x5."
3,They have come along way since this camera,"Was very easy to use and took fast nice pictures, was dropped once about 2 days after I bought it and it completely broke, Got a refurbished one from Kodak and the camera never worked right, it eventually went completely out after the warranty was up of course. Did take good pictures while it lasted though."
4,"I like it, its okay..","My friend she gave me this CD, cos she said she doesn't hardly listen to it much. I actually like it myself, but there's 2 songs I don't like on this CD which are track 12 which is ""Infields where we lay"", and ""Blame it on the weatherman"". Those 2 are the only ones I don't like. One of my favorite songs are ""If it don't fit."" :) Bwitched is actually a good group. I hope they release more albums soon!! Buy this Cd if you're a Bwitched fan or just a fan of pop music."
5,This CD is da bomb,"I love this CD for two main reasons: one is that it is so pretty. Like, the cover and the disc itself. I love the jungle look and the butterfly. And the other reason is because of the SONGS! I just love the intro notes to ""Shy One"". SO cool! I would reccomend this CD highly."
2,Missing the old album,This album was definitly not as good as the first. Her voice gets so annoying and some of the songs really had no rythem. Next time they shouldnt try so hard.
1,Nothing New Here...,"The same old thing over and over,manufactured pop music for kids that don't know what ""real"" music is!This is a good example of why music is in a state of decay...The one star is for the girl Lindsay she's got the looks,i'll give her that..."
1,Disposable,"When on ballads, they sound too much like Wilson Phillips. On mid-tempo and fast-paced ones, they don't pronounce their cheesy lyrics well, and the arrangements sometimes sound like a bad and cookie-cutter attempt to blend their pop with a more rock sound."
1,CHEESY AS HELL!,"You must be on ACID for giving this CD more than 2 stars. You thought the SPICE GIRLS were terrible, but this is 1,000,000 as worse. THESE GIRLS NEED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND GET A LIFE. I don't see what's the point in getting this CD. Their songs are meaningless and flat out ANNOYING!"
2,Could have been a lot better!,"This CD dosen't have the same attitude as their singles and self-titled CD had. The lyrics aren't as good, and the songs aren't sung nearly as well. Their first was soooo much better!"
5,Britney is in the Mix!!!,"This cd is so good! The songs are really good, too. I love Britney, so I was glad when this cd came out. Here are the tracks:1. Toxic - Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction Mix (Edit)2. Me Against The Music Featuring Madonna - Justice Remix3. Touch Of My Hand - Bill Hamel Remix4. Breathe On Me - Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Mix5. I'm A Slave 4 U - Dave Audé Slave Driver Mix6. And Then We Kiss - Junkie Xl Remix7. Everytime - Valentin Remix8. Early Mornin' - Jason Nevins Remix9. Someday (I Will Understand) - Hi-Bias Signature Radio Remix10. ...Baby One More Time - Davidson Ospina 2005 Remix11. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - Hex Hector Club Mix (Edit)GET IN THE MIX!!!!!!!!! GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD TODAY!!!"
5,Wonderful Britney remixes,"I have just about every Britney CD, and I was very pleased to add this one to my collection. Instead of just creating a compilation of Britney's remixes from over the years, they put alot of work in and created all new remixes (except for Baby one more time). Most of the songs are from the ""In the Zone"" album, and I actually like most of the remixes versions better (such as ""touch of your hand"", which is far superior as a remix). I also liked the ""everytime"" remix, so much that I purchased the ""everytime"" import single (which I recommend)."
1,the ultimate trashy album,The latest remix album from Britney is a collosal failure just like last two albums.all the songs are bad.NOT WORTH EVEN A LISTEN.Avoid this and all her other albums.
5,The best motivational book that I 've read thus far!,"This a truly remarkable account of Griffith's story and the obstacles that he's faced to get where he is today(the best fullback in the NFL). There were so many points in his life that he could have given up--but he didn't. Don't think that it's your ""typically"" sports book--it's not! This book is for anyone that aspires to fulfill their dream. I highly recommend this book. Kudos to Griffith!!!"
3,"Improvement vs. old belt, but still noisey","Bought 1998 Mustang in 2010. After replacing noisey idle pulley, tension pulley and having noisey alternator rebuilt, old belt seemed in good shape but made noise often. So bought this belt as replacement. It's a big improvement, but still some noise now and then."
3,Looks good until you shoot it.,"Its not a terrible gun but it said 290fps it goes about 160fps and it shoots about 30 feet. Ill give it about a three star. Its great for a starter, but if you play a lot you'll want a more reliable pistol (try a gas)"
4,4.5 Stars,"The Last Samurai followed the pace of Zimmer's 'Thin Red Line'. Although a bit similar, the Last Samurai carried the themes further on an emotional level. There are also familiar bits from 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Gladiator' that were not included in this commercial release soundtrack. But not too saturated with those themes.The Last Samurai does build a slow theme, but it is at much more satisfying momentum than other scores that through and jumble themes instantly. The first track 'A Way of Life' is a pure example of building pace.If you do want more, go to Hans Zimmer official site and they will have a couple bonus tracks to listen too. These are slight variations of the tracks from 'Ronin' to 'A Small Measure of Peace.'I did purchase this soundtrack before I have seen the movie.Afterwards, I gave Zimmer's work much more appreciation. It reflected much of the peaceful tones and heated battles during the film. Apart from the film this score can stand alone."
4,Subtle but powerful,"Subtle, not loud and exciting until final tracks. Good mood music, not as ""Oriental"" as I remembered from the movie. You can't lose with Zimmer."
5,Good balance between the past and the present,"I didn' heard about Hans Zimmer before the Gladiator was first rolled out which both the movie and the soundtrack were excellent. Now that the Last Samurai was released I can't stop listening to it !! You have to buy this album, it worths more that you pay for, however I do recommend to watch the movie first to get into the old Japanese environment, culture, phylosofy and the way of the warrior ""bushido"". Hans Zimmer music expresses the environment where old samurai and Japanese culture fussion frezzing the advance of the modern western influence ...My simple advice is to watch the Movie and don't wait any second !! Go and get this CD soundtrack !!!"
2,NICE BUT,"THE MOVIE I DID NOT SEE,THE SOUNDTRACK WELL WOW I HOPE THE MOVIE IS NOT LIKE THIS BOREING SCORE?THE CURSE OF THE EVIL LAKE BY LEE DONG JUNE IS SO MUCH BETTER OR THE BEATIFUL SCORE TO ""HERO"" BY TAN DUN IS WAY BEYOND THIS OVER RATED SCORE.HEY THE OTHER SCORES BY ZIMMER ARE SO FULL OF LIFE."
5,Brilliant,"This is a wonderful album for Stephin Merritt fans eagerly awaiting the follow up to ""69 Love Songs."" It's also probably the best introduction to his oeuvre for newcomers as it highlights some of the best tracks from the last Magnetic Fields and 6ths albums.The main attraction for longtime fans is the five new Magnetic Fields songs. Lyrically, he's as sharp as ever with his droll, Steinian wit. Musically, he continues to build on the foundations of ""69 Love Songs"" with some notable throwbacks. ""Heather Heather"" is a very satisfying Holiday sequel that I've been craving for years while ""Stray with Me"" recalls the country swagger of Charm of the Highway Strip. ""One April Day"" is simply gorgeous--one of the most beautiful pieces he's done for ukulele. Overall, these new songs suggest the poise he will bring to the new Magnetic Fields album following the urgency of ""69 Love Songs."" I can't wait!"
3,2 stars or 3? That is the question.,"Well, I always wear a size 9M, and the 9Ms I ordered are too short. The width is not bad, but not as comfortable as one would expect of a slipper. The band is quite snug around the top of the foot, making it hard to work my foot in. They do seem very warm. Very. Warm. As in they don't breathe. I've had them on for approximately 7 minutes and I'm dying to finish this review so I can get them off and go look for something different to wear! Fortunately, I specifically ordered the least expensive color, not knowing if I'd like them. Now I know. Hopefully they will, in fact, stretch a little, otherwise I'm out of luck. Order with care!"
2,Too Atrificial,I gave this variety a chance and would NOT order again. I'll stick with Green Mountain French Vanilla.
4,Platinum Review,"Very good introduction to Bryan Ferry. However, it is missing ""Everytime You Go Away""."
2,Not worth the investment,The projects did not really inspire me to go out and create. Some tips on basic techniques will be helpful to some readers.
5,Great beginner guide,This is a great beginner guide with lots of fundamental information. The pictures are very high quality and offer a lot of inspiration. I would recommend this book to anyone getting started in metal work.
4,Great Idea Book,The pictures are great and give lots of ideas for combining metals. The shapes used are interesting and I liked learning about different methods of joining.
2,I don't get all the hoopla over this thing,"I put this on my baby registry because it had such great reviews for a mobile. My daughter is almost 11 months now and I still dislike the Flutter Bug Mobile. I don't understand why it's so highly reviewed.First off, you can wind it all the way up and the music doesn't last very long. Secondly, the ""wings"" come off very easily. One of the first things my daughter learned to do was pull them off one by one during each diaper change. The last time she did that, she took the wing and dropped it in her diaper area, which meant it got poopy and I had to hand wash it. She often drops the wings down the back of her changing table. Basically I spend most of her diaper change trying to keep her from losing the wings. Thirdly, this mobile never worked its magic. It didn't seem to keep her from crying during a diaper change. The only thing that's interested her is pulling off those wings. How annoying!I think this mobile is a big waste of money."
3,Not the best....,"Barely any pages for $3.99. Very few words per page. A book a child would read once, and not read, again. Maybe, should have borrowed from the library instead of buying would have been better. Therefore, would not recommend to purchase but to borrow from the library."
4,Recording to CD,"I am yet to buy one of these but it looks fantastic. I want to use it for recording but converting stuff won't be a problem.Why? Transfer the file, open the software, open a decent sound recorder (not old windows one, but media player 8-9-10 might do the job) and set it up to capture at the quality you want, use volume control to turn on recording from ""WAVE"" or ""WHAT U HEAR"" with volume at max, mute everything else, you can guess the rest maybe?Fully digital transfer bypassing the DACs and amps.. only problem is using the sound card, its at single speed. :-)Its slow and still might not be as good as you want, but it will definately beat the method i've had to use with an older one, first of the MDLPs - transferring from headphone to line plug and then having to amplify it by a crazy amount."
4,Over Loaded,"This book is packed full with recipes on drinks, but I wouldn't suggest this book if your just starting out with Bartending. It doesn't tell you how to pour or what not to mix togather. But if your good at that this is the book for you."
2,"Enjoyable, entertaining fiction of average caliber","When this book was first offered to the public, it was not clear exactly whether it was radically new historic material, or the author's imagination. Without recounting the explosive battles between Earp historians that followed, when the dust shook out, it became clear that fiction it was. As fiction, my own opinion is that it is rather average--Boyer is not a prose master. But it does have some fun and fine moments. If you like educated speculation on how the past might have played out, it will not disappoint."
4,Commuter Train To Hell!,"The thing you have to realize about THE SPIDER is that he fights bad guys. Not bad guys ""they had a difficult childhood"", but bad guys ""pure evil"". In CORPSE CARGO, the bad guys are stopping trains, killing and robbing everyone on them, and then sending trains full of dead bodies zooming off out of control down the tracks. These are not nice people. But rest assured that THE SPIDER will stop them, and that he isn't going to be reading them their rights, or shooting the gun out of their hand. His motto: ""Death to the bringers of death!"" Not really catchy and not PC-enough to be on a T-shirt anymore, but it gives you an indication of the action and adventure you can expect."
5,"Oh! Yes I wanna testify, This is the best work","I had a chance to listen to this many times at my local shop and I must say don't hesitate to purchase this cd it's good, very good actually. The guitar is clear, unstoppable once Djelimady puts his strong hands on it. The most appealing thing to me about this cd is the guitar, the lyrics(vocals)are great even though the man himself is not the leading vocalist. Some of the tracks have an AfroSpanish feel to it U could swear that Djelimady once had a Spanish guitar teacher. U can actually feel the variety within the songs each with its own sound though I must be honest on first listen I thought the songs sound the same but as I listened more, well I was hooked. I listened to B.Traore' & I must say Djelimady has an upper hand to him i.e Djelimady sounds better than Troare'(Apologies to Troare')Overall? this is a great cd it has a rooty feel, bluesy,AfroSpanish,but at the end of it all its an African Malian music at its best."
1,it was crap again,"I bought this after winter break and after four months the cd player stopped playing cds, sony you suck, and I would have to pay $29 for it to be refurbished. Any one who knows of any good cd player companies, I am open to ideas."
3,Green Can Hat,"The hat is good overall, I haven't used it a ton yet but the tube you drink from is a little thin and tends to be a little twisted is the place where is comes out of the hat. The Black spring loaded clip on the end is suppose to hold the flow of liquids coming out when your not drinking but it isn't strong enough and hasn't worked for me yet, so I just put the drinking end inside of the can with your not drinking from it.Overall good buy for the money, it's great for a couple of laughs and works decently once you get the tube untwisted and working properly."
4,Snuggle Fabric Softener Sheets,The Snuggle Fabric Softener Sheets are performing to my satisfaction. I would buy them again.
4,Compelling and mysterious Fens,"England's Fen country has always seemed compelling and mysterious to me ... which is why I picked up Jim Kelly's first mystery THE WATER CLOCK. The protagonist, reporter Philip Dryden, was also so compelling that I went right to Kelly's second mystery, THE FIRE BABY. Once again, Kelly weaves a story involving disparate characters acting and reacting badly over decades into a satisfying mystery."
4,The mysterious key,"A interesting coincidence occurred the other day. I picked up two seemingly unrelated books at the library and upon reading them I discovered that they shared a ""key"" plot feature: in each book the protagonist is trying to find the lock that fits a key that has been given by a (dead or incapacitated) family member!I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Jim Kelly has a wonderful way with words. The story is somewhat sensational and hard-boiled, but what do you expect from a murder mystery?The other book was ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"", which I do not recommend."
5,GROOVE is thekey!,"This CD is definitely in the Groove! It is reminiscent of the early funk fusion of Tom 'Jamaica Funk' Browne, Bernard Wright (who is on this cd), and Stanley Clarke. The difference- It's done to the hip-hop rhythms! And it works! No samples here- Only true musicians plaing the music the way it should be played, free and clear of samples and 'perfect' beats. The jazz/hip hop fusion played here gets an old-school die hard like me interested in seeing the possibilities.Hargrove is a true MUSICIAN and is following in the paths of Miles and Herbie who wasn't/isn't afraid to try new creative sounds and genres.Roy Hargrove is the future!"
5,Great cd!!,"Nice blend of smooth and funky jazz, neo soul, hip hop and r&b. Great guest artist in Erykah Badu, Q tip, D'angelo, Meshell N De ge ochello, and Common, One of the best cd's by a jazz artist that I have purchased since Soul Live's ""Next "" cd. A must have in your collection"
1,Roy Hargrove is today's best trumpeter . . .,"Unfortunately, this CD is a mistake! I've been a fan of Hargrove since I heard him play live, about the time Public Eye was released, and there's usually a Hargrove CD in one of my cars. Every Hargrove recording has been an automatic buy for me. No more. The RH Factor has no groove at all!"
3,The China part is old,"The China part is about 10 years old. For a country changing so fast, I cannot believe that such old video is published now."
2,Take the picture--- Please,"I've used a previous generation of the powershot and really liked it so we picked the A200 for an upgrade. What a waste. The interface is confusing, but worse of all is getting it to actually take a picture. Push down the button and it'll make a noise like its working on the picture-- but watch out cause it didn't do it. What its doing, I have no idea. Autofocus? Anyway it only took a real picture one in five times of trying. Sometimes I had to hold down the button for 4-5 seconds to get it to shoot. Extremely disappointing for Canon, I expected the 'next generation' and got something worse than our 1999 Canon camera."
1,"Controls, design sucks","Very difficult to deal with, especially to make adjustments in the dark- avoid unless you will rarely have to use this youtrself. It look good, but the design is awful."
1,"an alright game, but cannot be played with super scope","This game was decent in its time, but nothing special. to top that off you can only play this game with the Super Scope attachment which is near impossible to find. not that your missing much of anything as this game isn't that great. 2 stars."
5,Wild Grape Vine,"A very enjoyable and entertaining novel. The Limoges Vase has more twists and turns than a wild grape vine. Like the wild grape vine, the twists are not surprises, but add a pleasing symmetry to the story, especially the last one. Amazingly well written for first time novelists!"
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I ordered The Limoges Vase based on the short blurb and book cover, hoping it would be a ""good"" story. I was pleasantly surprised. It is more, much more and is now among the few books I do not loan to anyone. So, as I tell my friends, buy your own copy!"
4,"Not a Zombie yet, but still Shakendown","With this album fresh in my mind, compliments of that spectacular yearly event known as Halloween, thought I'd post this review.This is not to say it must be Halloween, a Gore Fest or a Fright Night to appreciate an album of ""Rockabilly"" songs about the dead, the undead, those soon to be dead and being evil, as one can enjoy such topics throughout the year. However, it does make such special occasions all the better, a Hell of alot more fun and will leave even non-zombies shakendown.If you like Rockabilly/Horrorbilly check out ""The Cramps.""If you like harder edged Rock/Punk songs about ghouls, martians and ""hideous deformed two-headed monsters"" check out ""The Misfits."""
2,Early Le Carre,"Early Le Carre. Not really a great success. I remember with joy the statement, 'I wouldn't be seen dead wearing blue'."
4,"Amazing cakes, mediocre recipes","Yes the designs are fun and gorgeous albeit mostly for advanced decorators but the cake recipes at the beginning of the book are not tasty at all. When I do make the cakes I use my own recipes and they come out tasting as good as they look. AS a cake designer my foremost priority is to make cakes that not only look good but are delcious too. They're equally important in my opinion. This book is all about the look. That's not a big handicap if you've got recipe files of sure-fire delicious cakes. But for beginners who may need details about what cakes are good for carving, which cakes for stacking, etc, they may not have the option of substituting better recipes.Still I would recommend this book if only for the ideas and step by step techniques for creating naughty yet classy cakes."
3,tulliani Men's Maxfield Italian leather belt,These belts are good for short term use. Scratch and look bad after only a few uses. they are okay for what you pay for but suggest buying higher quality.
5,From the Back Cover,"The lonely predicament of Carol Kennicott, caught between her desires for social reform and individual happiness, reflects the position in which America's turn-of-the-century, ""emancipated woman"" found herself. Carol's dilemma is intensified by the fact that she lives in the small, self-satisified, Midwestern town of Gopher Prairie. An allegory of exile and return, ""Main Street"" attacks the drab complacency and ingrown mores of those who resist change, who are under the illusion that they have chosen their tradition. Carol's ostracism, however, results more from her rejection by those whom she would have changed. Maxwell Geismar lauded this work as ""a remarkable diary of the middle-class mind in America."" Its author was hailed by John Galsworthy for having written ""a most searching and excellent piece of work; a feather in the cap of literature."""
5,I am a baker,This is absolutely fantastic!! I love it!! It has been used multiple times already!! I usually will lend my cake supplies to my friends but this one comes in handy way too much to lend out and not have at my disposal!
1,it's better than a microsoft smart phone,"I was at the office talking to a co-worker about microsoft's recent 2nd attempt to release a smart phone. I commented that microsoft just should stick to what it does best. Leaving my co-worker puzzled he said, ""and what would that be?"" Good point my friend. It's certainly not software."
2,HUGE Ball!,"This is NOT a ""Beginners Ballgag"". The ball is HUGE. With a cloth measuring tape wrapped around it, it measures 6"", and from point to point (one side) it measures just over 2 inches. Christ, who has a mouth that large? My jaw is still aching from the attempt to wear it.Spend more money on something better. And by the way, it DOES have a smell and made my throat tingle, and I am not allergic to rubber - so wtf?""Product Made In China"" - and it's going in your mouth. Be warned."
4,"Bit too large, fairly secure though","Like many others, I found this gag to be very large and uncomfortable... Some people might like that, but I couldn't recommend wearing it for long periods of time. In addition, swallowing excess saliva, a reflex of mine, is very difficult and uncomfortable. However, it is fairly secure, subs will have trouble pushing it out, and of course it looks wonderfully erotic."
4,Not bad,"This is a neat little guitar. It sounds pretty good for reduced size. The scale turns out to be 24.75(my favorite) instead of the 23.625 in the specs. It sounds great plugged into a PA or Stereo. Much easier to carry around or travel with than a standard acoustic. Quality is pretty good. My first one was cracked, but they sent me a new one. The second one had some loose hardware I had to tighten. Other than that, no major issues. I think their quality control could be a bit better, but this is the budget line. If you want a little better quality and hardware, spend about 60%(min.) more to step up to the Ovation line."
1,"Poor Quality, Not What I Expect From Sony","Purchased it to use on job sites; didn't need anything too fancy, the smaller size is what attracted me. The cassette feature along with CD seemed like a nice bonus.However, after one week the CD Player would not play a disc, instead read ""no disc"" even when one was inserted. I later have read where this is a common failure with this unit. I returned it and tried another, but this one gave the ""no disc"" error right out of the box. Very disappointing product from Sony.I ended up returning it and got something else entirely. Don't waste your time on this product."
2,Metabolism,"I found explanations of the pathways to be OK. However, some of the information needed to be further explained and some of the information seemed to be contradicting."
2,not waterproof,"first, the number for the date is too small. second, the watch claims to be waterproof, but the first time i wore it in a pool, water seaped in. amazon replaced it, but it still isn't waterproof."
4,Stargate is AWESOME,I love stargate Season 3 wasnt there best season in my opinion but it is still and awesome show. must have for stargate fans
3,Not worth the Money Paid,Although this book has some good picturesThe content info and the boring discussionmakes one come to the conclusion it is definitelynot worth the high price of 100 dollars or moreGood only for a library shelf
2,Not so happy,I bought this watch for my boyfriend in Iraq so before it went to him it came to me since most places don't ship to APO. Well I took it out to look at it and found that the numbers were extremely difficult to read unless you pushed the light button and when I did that I discovered that the buttons are very hard to push. I'm not entirely happy with the watch. My boyfriend does not wear it and has since gotten his old watch fixed. It is a nice looking watch and will probably take a heck of a beating but turned out to be not worth it.
3,Textbook Review,"What can you say about a textbook for class? Not much, so I will give good marks for the sender and say that I received the book and it is good shape."
5,"Very Intuitive, Thought Provoking Writing, Need More.","This Young writer is coming out with a blast. He issaying things that we all need to here in a direct butconsiderate way. His Approach demand attention, yethe present in a caring and spiritual arena.I give this young writer an A plus, bring on more.Eva Darlington Oddenton MD."
3,Best for Smaller Pets,"When I purchased this item, I intended to place it on top of a large storage container to elevate my dog's food dish, and hold it relatively still. My dog is 100#. This mat is virtually useless to me. I misunderstood the ""slightly raised bumps on the flat surface to hold the pets bowl in place"" as also being rubberized. They are not. They are the same slick plastic the rest of the mat is made of. I don't see how this could possibly hold his dish in place. Just the force of his tongue against the dish would have it sliding all over. The only thing the mat holds in place is itself. The description should have a disclaimer that it is for pets under 25 pounds. If I had cats, I would definitely make use of it and rate it higher. For now I'll stick with my industrial strength Velcro!"
4,Works great.,"A little bigger than I expected. They do stay put and have helped with the mess my cats used to make. I ordered two of these and randomly received one blue and one green shipped together. It was stated that colors might vary, but would have preferred to choose the color or at least get the same color for both."
4,Understandable Zen,This book with it's interpretations and translations gives the reader a better handle on the true nature of Zen. It will help clear out any cobwebs that spiritual explores may encounter along their journey.
5,Swinging!!!,"This is a great quartet record of bassist Leon Lee Dorsey. Features great vibraphone work from Bryan Carrott and Carlton Holmes is fantastic on piano. Vince Ector plays great drums also. Leon Lee Dorsey has played with Art Blakey, Lionel Hampton, Freddie Hubbard and many others."
1,Firestorm in Dresden,"In 52 minutes there was only one short 'by-the-way' reference to Dresden. This video is all about the B-17, Flying Fortress, in the 100th Bomb Group and nothing about the Firestorm in Dresden. The title is extremely misleading.Since this video's only reference to Dresden was one sentence and a short clip of flames from the air, I rated this video as a one because they will not let me rate it a zero. The title and content do not match.Dr. Don MacCuish"
1,What is the real list price?,"Amazon itself sells this watch (Casio Men's 93H-1AV Multifunction Sport Watch) for $19.80 down $5.15 from it's ""list price"" of $24.95. Casio itself on it's web site says the list price is $24.95. How can Brand Variety say the list price is $29.99? What goes on here?"
2,Vivre le...huh?,"In spite of the author's claim that this book is not for students, but aimed at casual readers with no knowledge of the history of the French Revolution, I found this to be not the case. By focusing on the ""Days"" of the Revolution, this book cries out for a context that is sorely lacking and ultimately a fatal flaw. Without an understanding of the French, the all too frequent use of French phrases adds to the muddle. The glossary included is not much help. All in all, a big disappointment. Dry to a fault."
4,The bloody French Revolution.,"This is certainly a great telling of the French Revolution. Louis XVI, Danton, Murat, Robespierre, Napeleon and other historical figures are prominent in this story of the French Revolution. I think Louis XVI comes across as a schemer, when in fact some of the history books portray him as a liberal well meaning king who could not lead. Danton is portrayed as an idealist who meant well. Murat and Robespierre were bloody thugs only interested in increasing their own power. It is well that the Revolution consumed them, since they didn't care whether it consumed other innocents. Napeleon makes an appearance at the end of the book when he pushes aside the other Directors to become virtual ruler of France.This is a good telling of the French Revolution. One gets the true sense of what happened in this nice biography of a truly tragic event."
3,Disappointed,"As others have expressed, I was disappointed that ""normal"" people were not interviewed for this book. Teachers, nurses, computer people etc. All the celebrities and highly-accomplished people made me feel small. It seemed kind of elitist to me. If it wasn't some lawyer or doctor, it was someone related to producing in broadcast television.I am struggling with the SAHM and SAWM issue right now and am part-time SAWM. Some of the ""unsuccessful"" stories where the woman came back and said she shouldn't be in the book were very interesting to me.The overall impression I got is that you have to work if you want to stay competitive. This I am not sure is true. Also no mention of normal type jobs. I guess it all comes down to your definition of success. The elitism I felt was that the definition of success in the book had to do with money, degrees and where you could get before having a baby. Then she was pushing for you to keep working if you could. I felt it was very anti-SAHM."
5,My Favorite Year,Enthusiastic and utterly entranced by the quality of the acting and the message that it delivered. I know that this film will be enjoyed over and over. Peter O'Toole was utterly enchanting. I was delighted to find the film and be able to purchase.
1,"""Great Expectations, alas not realized...""","In terms of Comedic Farce,this is a excellent send up of 50's Live TV & Sid Ceasar's Show of Shows. It IS ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES !!! When I found it available on DVD, I ordered it. When it finally arrived, I made time to view it. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the POOR quality of the DVD !!! It was dark, uneven, as if produced under someone's truck in their chicken yard !!! It has been a few weeks & I am STILL fuming. I feel as if I've been hoodwinked & played the fool.Great Movie...POOR Product !!!"
1,could not view,I did not receive access to view the film. Please resend access so that I might be able to view it.
4,Worth the read and to keep,I had read this years ago as a library book but wanted my own copy and I read it again. It was a great idea and thanks to Anne for correcting all the spelling and grammar errors (I'm sure there were plenty). It does a very good job of showing how widespread the phenomenon really is; and Whitley's insights were perfect.
3,A different side of Ayn,"This is a play written with an ending that the audience gets involved with a vary unique twist, I recommmend it to anyone looking for a different view of Ayn Rand."
1,OK for a while,"The lens worked well for me for about 30 days and then it went dark. The warranty repair shop tells me that it has a crack and so the manufacturer's VERY limited warranty doesn't apply. I didn't drop the lens and in 20+ years of photography, I have never had a problem with any lens.Be aware that the warranty doesn't cover very much and be prepared to return the lens or dispute your charge if you have a problem.Very disappointing."
2,"Balky zoom feature, but good photo resultgs",I've had this lens for nearly 5 years. For the most part it provides good image results. The zoom feature has been sticky on and off since I got it (I should've returned it immediately when this happened). The inevitable happened last weekend when it no longer zooms! I have to push/slide it out (still getting good photo results).I emailed the dealer to see if it is still under warranty. Not happy as this is about a $300 purchase. I'll cope with it the way it is as I'm too broke to buy a new lens. I use it with a Nikon D50 and have always been pleased with photo results.
1,awful,"This lens is terrible. The focus isn't sharp, and if you don't engage the zoom lock, the lens just slides in and out. I returned it.Do not purchase this product!"
1,Auto Focus does not work with Nikon D5000,It was a very bad surprise to find out that there is no Auto Focus on this lens...it only works in manual focus with the D5000 Nikon camera. As it is a heavy and large lens with a wide range (28-300) it makes it almost impossible to get the right focus on a moving target.I am returning mine.
3,what whith the gay movement,I loved the book but I really getting tired of the gay agenda ramed down our throughts
4,Useful for Basic Text Chat,"Well what can I say beyond the fact that this particular model of keyboard is useful in basic text chat upon the Playstation 3 and its Playstation Network? Though it's a bit bulky considering that one is transitioning from the six axis / dualshock 3 controller to a PC worthy keyboard and something to get used to, but once it is done, one will be glad that you no longer have to use the time consuming controller-based text board."
4,Really just a plain ol' keyboard,"Pros:-Durable-Long cord (8 feet)-You know it will work with your PS3-PriceCons:-Plain design (but at least it's black)-An included palm rest would have been nice-No included instructions on what keys do what (check out the PS3 manual at the official PlayStation website for some internet browser keyboard shortcuts [Support->Manuals->PS3->System Software User's Guide])Notes:-You will still need to use a PS3 controller to use certain functions, as far as I can tell-This might be obvious, but you can also use a USB mouse with PS3"
1,Cordless Keyboard????,"Product overview says cordless??????? stupid LIENo usb adaptor at allLiE LIE LIE dont buy this thingUnless u like a cord laying on the ground, dont buy this thing"
5,Tough little keyboard,"I purchased this keyboard for my PS3 because i was sick and tired of having to enter everything into the playstation using the controller to select every letter. I previously had a wireless keyboard which was just fine but I got sick of needing to replace the batteries. This keyboard has a long cable so there is plenty of slack for you to use this even at a pretty good distance from your PS3. It has also taken quite a bit of abuse. It has been dropped, left under piles of junk, tripped over and stepped on, even had a glass of water or two spilled onto it and it still works great. And all for 20 bucks, a bargain. If you want a wired keyboard for your PS3 this is the way to go."
3,A disappointing ending to a long story,We read this book in our book group and most of us agreed that the book was not as good as the reviews would lead one to believe. This is a long book and the story did get me through to the end but I was really disappointed that nothing was resolved in the end. I felt as if the writer left it unresolved only as a way to sell the sequel. This is not a book that I will think about in the future and remember. And I have no desire to read the next in the series.
5,AMAZING,"I can not say enough about this book!!! In the years since its first publication, I have returned to the story three times to fall in love with Annie d'Inard, Andrew and Scotland. I'm currently reading it again--in preparation for the sequel--and not only are the words still beautiful and true but even knowing the plot I stay up late turning the pages. It'll a break your heart for sure but, in the same breath, will put it back together again.Without the pretense of ""literature,"" and unafraid to broach increasingly relevant issues such as HIV, the aftermath of an unwinnable foreign war waged by Americans and the intertwining of our global community, I believe this novel may just be the greatest love story of our time."
3,"Somewhat useful, but not all inclusive","A very basic book of herb lore. But certainly not the one book you need for ""Magical Herbalism"". Easy to read and understand. Is now a little out-dated. A good a place as any to start if you are a beginner. It will give you a desire for more knowledge and start you on your quest."
3,"A solid, basic grimoire","Scott Cunningham does it again, providing a simple, easy to understand guide to magickal herbalism. Beginning with an introduction to tools and magick, Cunningham presents a detailed guide to the preparation and use of herbs in magick including making perfumes, oils, insense, amulets and charms.While I prefer to write my own spells, this book was very helpful in getting me started. But I can only give it three stars because it pales in comparison with his much more detailed ""Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs."""
4,Covers All,"This book covers many areas in magical herbology, such as amulets, oils, and herbs themselves among other things. It's great for a beginner. I highly recommend this, but his other book, Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs, has a much more in depth look at the indevidual herbs themselves."
3,cost effective,"It's not the best sounding instrument I own , but is the best suited for travel and cost effective !!"
4,"Sun-In lightens without damage, but this price is higher than retail","To get my hair back to golden/brown, I used sun-in on the parts of my hair that have grown in dark every night for about a week. I do take care to condition well prior to use and leave my hair slightly damp before use. I then blow dry on a medium heat, with the dryer very close to my scalp, so as to get the maximum lightening at the roots. At the end of the week, my whole head of hair is light blond, which I can leave as is or color in a week (I don't like to color right after using sun-in, as that can lead to frizzes).I won't mention the name of the major pharmacy chain that retails this, though the sun-in site gives that info, but found it there for substantially less than I paid here ($4-$5)."
5,Loved it!,"A revelation to those who like Ska! The music on this CD is forward looking but relies heavily on the way Ska used to be. It's going to be huge and you'll be telling your friends, ""Judge Roughneck? Yeah I've been listening to them for years."" Buy it, Live it."
1,Wont work for 5000 or higher.,"received the keyboard, looks good but will not work with the aspire 5000 series or higher it has the wrong pigtail. the description is false. now im out 35 bucks and i have a pissed doff customer who has to wait another 3-4 days.. thanks. 1 star due to shabby listings."
5,Better than I expected,"I love the reclining feature of this chair. We have a newborn in the house, and in the full-recline position, it's a great place to set him where he can see people around and where he's easier to lift in and out than from a bouncy seat on the floor. The back of the chair is rounded and cradles him nicely. We also use it with an 8-month old who is at our house a lot. It's very easy to change the recline position, which is good since we switch it back and forth a lot. The 8-month-old is a little wobbly, but does well with the full-upright position because the back cradles him in nicely. I like the belts that hold the seat firmly on the chair both under and behind. This is a big improvement over another brand ""on-a-regular-chair-type"" high chair we've used, which was way less secure."
2,tray doesn't fit in dishwasher,"The good - Very adjustable, easy to adjust, fits on chairs, and generally works as described. Very easy to take off the fabric, run it through the washing machine. Attaching it to a chair was a snap.The moderate - it generally seems to take up more room than it should - we are past the need for all of the reclining, which I think drove a lot of the space hogging. It isn't at all practical to take this with you places.The bad - the tray is HUGE. Way way bigger than necessary, which meant we could not get it to fit in our dishwasher, no matter how hard we tried. For that reason we returned it and got theFisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat, Red/White. That model had a tray that was plenty big enough, but easily fit in the dishwasher"
3,Nice chair but some issues,"The chair is overall a good product, but when I've received it the chair was a little bit dirty and have scratches on the back of the chair, also the fixation to hold the baby were not easy to assemble, I had to unsew the strap and resew it..."
4,Great little chair!,My only regret is it doesn't slide under the table. Of course that was easily fixed. I bought a used wooden chair and just hacked the legs off so it would slide under. However when it comes time to use it as a booster seat I wish the tray slides would fold down. But all this considered I am not sorry I purchased this seat. It is stable and I love the reclining mechanism. Brilliant!
5,A Space Saver Indeed!,"I have no regrets purchasing this product, its fits right in around the dinner table and it is indeed a space saver. Its easy to clean and I have found it to be quite durable as well. Most importantly, its great at feeding time. NOTE: It doesn't work well with a soft bib though, the tray gets in the way."
3,Good but difficult to clean,We've been using this high chair for about 7 months and overall it works well. It easily attached to my dining room chair and doesn't take up much space. I love the big tray and the recline feature. My biggest complaint with this product is that it is very difficult to clean. My son is a messy eater and there are tons of little nooks and crevices that food gets stuck in; it almost seems as if the designers purposefully created places for food to hide. If I had to do it again I would probably purchase something else.
2,Difficult to keep clean,Both MIL and SIL have this chair so I was excited to get one for LO. I was sadly disapointed to see that the cover was not waterproof/easy clean like the ones I've seen before. Having to wash every other day is rather cumbersome.
5,We love this high chair.,"This high chair is great. Even if you don't need to save space, it is so convenient. It beats moving around one of the full size high chairs. And this one does everything a full size on can do. It reclines, the tray can go in the dishwasher, and is very sturdy. It slides right up to our table which is very nice. When our daughter is older, we can remove the tray and it becomes a booster seat and she can eat at the table with us. So far, there's nothing we don't like about it and would recommend it highly."
5,Wonderful High Chair!,I bought this high chair in addition to the regular high chair I have because I have 2 grandsons 4 months apart in age. This high chair is wonderful. I can put it in one of my chairs when needed and store it in a closet when not needed. I take it to my in-laws for family gatherings and my youngest grandson just likes to sit in it on the floor. It's lightweight and easy to clean. I love it!The only thing I would change is the drab color.
4,"No regrets, except taking up an empty chair all of the time","We have owned this chair for almost a year now, and I mainly started looking at this type of high chair because I did not want to spend over $100 for a stand alone version. I don't regret it though, the chair is very well made and sturdy. There are tons of straps to keep it safely on the chair, and tons of straps to keep your baby safe IN the seat. The tray easily comes off to rinse it off in the sink, or probably even in the dishwasher. I am not sure if it is dishwasher safe but it seems like it would be. If you have company and need the extra seat, the chair does come off easily and the straps stay adjusted so you can put it back on just as tight as it was."
5,Perfect Size for a smaller home!,"This arrived much sooner than I had expected, and is the perfect size for our small home. We wanted something that would not take up an entire corner of the room, and something that we could also easily pack in the car to bring to Grandma & Grandpa's house. The tray is so easy to clean, and the cover easily comes off to be thrown right in to the washer! The price was excellent, and I would buy it again!"
4,Very Happy.,"I searched for awhile to find a high chair that suited our needs - portable, easy to clean, & space economical. The Fisher-Price Space Saver works for us very well. It easily attaches/detaches to any chair via 2 straps and is very secure. The cover & straps come off to be washed. Although they aren't cheap, I've even found quality replacement covers online. The chair is very adjustable and since it is convertible to a booster seat, I foresee us using it for many years. One comment about the tray - even though it is dishwasher safe, I have yet to find a dishwasher that it fits into very well, but maybe I've just had small dishwashers."
4,Perfect for saving space!,This high chair is great if you don't want to waste space in your kitchen/dining room with one of those full size high chairs. We actually replaced a toddler booster seat with this high chair because of the comfort factor and the size of the tray.One thing I can't figure out though - what are the top straps for? They don't hook up to anything...they are just there?(maybe I didn't read the directions well enough)
4,Good Seat,"We got this seat because we have limited space in our dining room and buying a full high chair would have taken up too much room. Our eight month old son enjoys having his own seat and seems less distracted sitting in it as compared to his Bumbo, which allowed for a lot more movement. We are excited that he will be able to sit with us at the table in his own seat."
2,Does not work at the table,"Since this attaches onto a chair, you would assume that it could be used AT the table. Not so! The arms get in the way and the seat is not the right height. The tray is bulkier than most other high chairs and tough to fit in the dishwasher.The highchair is fine when you use it pushed back from the table. But it does not work at the table or without the tray. Two things I think are very important if you are skipping the full sized highchair."
4,"Great for baby, OK for toddler","We used this as our primary high chair all throughout our son's need for one. For infant and baby feeding, it was supportive, easy to clean (though the tray never fit in our dishwasher properly), and fit multiple chairs. It was a little bulky for travel, but made several car trips with us and worked well at friends' and relatives' homes.Once our son reached the toddler phase, though, the chair became less useful. With the back and cushions removed, he couldn't sit up properly (the seat became bucket-like, and he had to slump forward uncomfortably to reach the tray well). Also, the arms never fit under any of our tables, so we couldn't use this as a booster without the tray. For this reason, we've moved onto the Safety 1st booster, but have stored this away for use with future babies."
4,Works For Us,"I got this as a gift and I like it. It's not the cutest, most perfect chair in the world, but it works great for us. It was easy to put together, and it works well with our small eat-in kitchen. I didn't realize how many straps would be on it, and my husband says our baby looks like she's ready for take-off when she's strapped in. I guess the straps are a good thing though.It is a space saver because I don't know where I'd put a regular high chair. This one sits where the kitchen chair it's hooked to usually sits. When not using it, I just put the chair sideways instead of pushed up under the table because obviously it won't push up under the table."
4,Space Saver high Chair,"A great high chair. Takes up so little space, cleans easily. I love the tilting feature for seating small babies or for when the baby falls asleep eating.It's so practical and looks so nice in the dinette as it has neutral colors and subdued pattern. The price is very reasonable, too. It was exactly whatwe needed. It turns into a booster seat, too."
1,brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!,This would be a great addition to any collection of the series - everyone in my family enjoyed going through them and learning more about the various characters from the books.
4,Bought them for my dad as a birthday present,"...and he enjoyed them as well. His 3 daughters and 2 sons-in-law are all big Harry Potter fans and after my dad retired this year he sat down and read all the Harry Potter books.I bought this set on a whim for his birthday and he says they're really neat - he enjoyed the notes in the margins from Harry, and the hangman games that Harry and Ron played during classes. Gives you a more realistic feel for the fiction inside the books.And of course I had to buy them for him so I can take a look at them as well! It's a quick but enjoyable bit of reading to tide us all over until the 7th book is released here in the States."
4,Harry's Books,"Harry Potter's schoolbooks (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages)are interesting to read. The Quidditch book is more school-like than the Fantastic Beasts book, but it shows you where the Golden Snitch came from (it started out as a Golden Snidget, a type of bird) and some different teams that are in Quidditch. The Fantastic Beasts book is much more amusing because it has some notes ""written"" by Harry, Ron, and a little from Hermione. Many different beasts are written in there and it is interesting to learn about what new monsters we might see in future Harry Potter books. It also tells about manticores and fire crabs, mentioned in book 4 of Harry Potter (Hagrid bred a manticore and fire crab to make the Blast-Ended Skrewts). I would say that these books are great!"
3,too much,"I got these from my grandmother and I just thought that they were too much. It was a little cool with all the notes written in and things like that, but I never really read it straight, because it was too much like school. I love the harry potter books but i think that all this harry potter mania goes a little bit over the edge."
4,If you like Harry Potter you'll like these books.,It is cool to read book on the creatures that exist in Harry Potter and of the magical game called quiditch.
1,*snore*,"ok, i'm a huge fan of the potter series, but these 2 books, god, i couldn't even finish them. talk about boring"
5,A Great Cure for those going through Harry Potter Withdraw!,While waiting for the fifth book and the movie these textbooks were wonderful reads. Hilarious and informative JK Rowling is brilliant again. I just wish they were both longer!
3,"Harry Potter Schoolbooks Box Set: From the Library of Hogwarts: Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, Quidditch Through The A",The two books were good. I was hoping to see some sketches of the beasts though. The comments were funny.
3,"This book is good, but.............","I like to enjoy reading J.K. Rowling's book, so I bought all her books, I also bought this two book, whiches kind of good, not as good as Harry Potter's. YOu need to know that this two book has nothing to do with Harry Potter. It's mostly about the Beasts in the book Harry Potter and the Oudditch game rules of Qudditch. If those peoples who like to enjoy the senen of Qudditch or the beasts Hagrid always think they cute babies.... you got to buy it!"
3,Harry Potter Schoolbooks,"I bought these books as soon as they came out and red them within the hour. They're surprisingly short and they were easy to read. Both were cute books, but I would only sugest them to they die-hard potter fans. While they are cute to read, I don't think they would as appreciated by those who have only read one or two potter books, or by those who like the potter books but don't obsess over them. Anyway, I did find it enjoyable to read the comments made by Ron, Hermione, and Harry in 'Fantastical beasts and where to find them'-they added some flair to the book. On the whole, I would say read these books if you have nothing else to read. While they are decent, thery aren't spectacular. They cover particulars about the wizarding realm but the information isn't anything new."
3,Doesnt have all magical creaturs,"This book is O.k. if you just need something to read till book 5.Butits not that great Fantastic Beasts & where 2 find themdoesnt have blast ended skrewts,house elves,banshees,vampires,giants,dementors,ogres,poltergeists,ghosts,or boggarts."
5,cool,"These were some pretty nifty little books. And i do mean little, not more than like 50 pages or something, but they were worth it. The books told you a lot about different magical things(and also explained many phenomenons such as the Loch Ness Monster). I'd suggest buying these just to fill in the wait for Book 5. And it also showed that US money sucks for galleons. Well, buy them if you want a short, entertaining little read"
3,"Good, but not great!","These are nice little additions for Harry Potter fans. The quality of the box container thing could be better, its just folded cardboard. The books are okay, but could have been much longer. They seem kind of like not much thought went into them, they don't get very deep, there are no spoilers here. I think a kid having read the whole HP book series would feel like this is a kiddie'd down version of whatever. Maybe one day Rowling will fill in all the holes in the universe and write all the books and back stories down. That would be great!"
4,Fantastic Book,"This book is wonderful, if your children are as addicted to Harry Potter (and everything that goes along with the Harry Potter world), as mine are, this is the book for them!!!! My children have showed their friends, and they are so envious. The other children wanted to know where to get the book. WE LOVE IT!!!!!"
5,Best Triceratops toy-EVER!,"I got him in 2009 for my 9th birth day. Ever since, I've played with him in mud, water and in movies. If you get him, you should play with him well. One thing is that he has bendy horns and bumpy skin, and he's very heavy. All I have to say is that you'll enjoy him very much!Cedar"
2,Stereo Instructions!,It reads like stereo instructions and is not very clear within its instructions. I was disappointed.
2,"Game is ""picky"" with answers","I got this game since I've been a fan of FF since it came on TV. This version was a bit disappointing. The computer can be very picky with accepting answers. Unless you type it as they have it, you often will get a strike. Also, the game seems to move painfully slow, and the host repeats himself - a lot. I was told I unlocked a new stage set to play, but every time I chose this set, the game didn't recognize it, and I had to choose another stage set.The computer almost always steals successfully, and of course it has the answers as they appear on the board. I've since gotten the PC version of Family Feud 2010, and it's MUCH BETTER than this game. Hell, The PS1 and PC version of FF with Louie Anderson hosting is better than this version - and I hated Louie as the host of FF."
4,a good little book,"The book summarizes the earliest proponents and opponents of evolution, the voyage of the Beagle, and the closest members of Darwin's family.All of it is easy to read except a chapter entitled ""Evidence for evolution"" (pp. 116-128).The book could be improved with an FAQ chapter, answering questions such as ""Why are there still monkeys?"" and ""What good is half an eye?""The book is small, profusely illustrated, and can be read in a short time. If there were more of it, I would give it a 5."
4,Good product; radio/TV digital channels could be user-friendlier,"Great for all my cassettes, and I love having the TV channels along with the radio. I just wish the digital functions were a lot easier to use for the radio stations. It would be much quicker using an old-fashioned dial for the radio."
1,disappointing,"I bought this item thinking it to be the new and improved Sony WM-FX244 Walkman Digital Tuning AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player, it's not. The slimmed down version is slick, the controls ideal, but no reception. TV and weather are useless, and the FM limited, but even the AM has deminished from the older version. Yet, the sound is better, if there is reception. For $5 less I'm getting another WM-FX244."
5,Outstanding sound and value,"This is truly a marvelous unit.The sound is really the main feature esp for its size and on one AA battery no less. Ergonomics (handling, ease of use ) could be better but really for the price it sounds like something much more expensive.Tuning fine once you get used to it and the headset fine.AM/Fm good resonance and reception, esp down here (Fla).which tends to be difficult."
3,"It Is What It Is, but it's not what you said","Every piece of written description of this Cassette Player from first to the one above says that it is a ""Stereo Cassette Player with FM/AM/TV Weather tuning"". THERE IS NO TV. THE VENDOR SAYS THEY HAVE NEVER HAD THIS ITEM WITH TV. The vendor did agree to return my money, and that's all well and good, but I wanted TV. It got 3 stars because it's good for what it actually is. But not if you want TV."
1,Logitech Cordless Desktop Comfort Laser,Not the keyboard one expects from Logitech. The keys are hard to press and the setup was not what I expected from a $80.00 keyboard. The keyboard was returned to Amazon (Great customer service from Amazon by the way) and hopefully I will be ordering the Logitech diNovo.
4,Good price and value,"I am a huge fan of the mouse...it fits great in your hands and has great features that are easy to get to. The keyboard is pretty good too, I only have a couple of issues:1. Sometimes there are delays in the signal when you are typing and it won't type.2. The set up on the keyboard could be better for the ""extra"" functions. They are not easy to get to since the keyboard is raised in the middle.Overall, great value for the money."
5,Best keyboard mouse combo ever,"<--carugoman's wife..I've been using split keyboards for over 10 years... wirelessly for close to 7. This is by far, the best combination I've used. After constant use, my current set.. from 2006 shows very little wear.. well, except the model numbers from the bottom of the mouse. The keyboard has no lag time, all keys work.Logitech no longer makes this item, so I'm going to be on the hunt for back stocks of this product in the event my current set ever decides to crap out."
3,A Little Disappointing,"The book is just okay. I think Oliphant took what might have been a good magazine article about the 1955 World Series and made a mistake by trying to turn it into a book. He fills the narrative with descriptions of his family, his teachers, his friends, and he tends to repeat the same points over and over again---his father suffered from illnesses he had picked up in World War II, his mother was a reticent but strong woman of Scandinavian descent. I don't mean to be callous, but I bought the book because I wanted to read about the Dodgers and the 1955 World Series, not Oliphant's piano teacher.Also, the book needed a good editor to correct the facts and straighten out the sometimes tangled sentences.I am still praying for Gil Hodges, by the way. I pray he gets into the Baseball Hall of Fame"
5,A Grand Slam With A Cherry On Top A Masterpiece,"Tom Oliphant's reconstruction of the 1955 season and the one and onlychampionship of the Brooklyn Dodgers is a masterpiece. Tom had an amazingyouth, full of New York characters like Sylvester Pat Weaver, Sigourney Weaverwhen she was still Susan, Yul Brynner and his sister, as well as hisbeing in the chorus of the Met. Billie Holiday makes a cameo too.A fond remembrance when New York had three great ball teams. Yes,WAlter O'Malley and Horace Stoneham deserve the obliquy they so richlyearned.I remember when the temples and churches prayed for Gil Hodges when hewas in a prolonged slump.Read this book and if you aren't a baseball fan already, you will becomeone."
3,A Kid in Brooklyn relives a lost time,"Thomas Oliphant's memoir of the 1955 World Series is a good story. It recalls Oliphant's childhood just as in the manner of Doris Kearns Goodwin with the following of the Brooklyn Dodgers.Oliphant does a great job of describing life in Brooklyn in mid 20th century Brooklyn. It was a home spun tale of an underdog that finally achieved the ultimate reward of a World Series Triumph. It truly was a communal experience.Finally the forces of good prevail over the dark forces from the Evil Empire of the Bronx. Good for them!!!! It was heartwarming but really not a breakthrough. I will write such a story when and if the Cleveland Indians win. For that matter a similar Chicago Cub fan can do the same. Our fellow Red Sox fans are already past this point. Sentimental read, sorry folks only 3 Stars."
4,My Husband loved it,"I purchased this book after hearing about it on a TV interview show. My husband is a huge Baseball fan and most of the books I buy for him are Baseball related. He told me it was 'great' and he read it from cover to cover in a few days. I think it captured an era that he recalled living through as a kid in New York City. He said that reading about the specific ball games in the book took him right back to those days. I think he enjoyed those parts of the book the most. There was quite a bit that told about the family life of the author which weren't quite as gripping but overall, judging from his reaction, I would say Baseball fans would love this book."
2,Beware!,"I suppose this is a very interesting book, if one is familiar enough with this concept of ""Ontological learning"" (which is somewhat explained in the book).I fell for the title because I work in information organisation, but this book has nothing to do with ontology and/or ontologies as such. It does deal with knowledge organisation and knowledge discovery, but in a largely academical (I would say) and at any rate mostly mathematical way. Get ready for an orgy of algebra!The Knuths among us will no doubt appreciate. In my case, it was a bit of a disappointment."
2,choose something else,"Although I am sure Kimberly is a fantastic teacher in person, this CD is simply awful! I gave it two good trys and put it in the junk drawer.I am a yoga CD junkie, so I am comparing to a fairly wide range. Rather than spending time on proper alignment or saftey, several-minute blocks are wasted on uninspired ""inhale, exhale"" instructions. The instructor's patronizing ""teacher voice"" lacks humor and I started to wonder if she knew what she was teaching.So, better options: Lauren Peterson's Yogi's companion is a great all around, and the one that I come back to with excitement. Cindi Lee and Natasha Rizopolous (sp?) are both good for straightforward, detailed instruction. Shiva Reah and Brian Kest are sometimes silly, but laughter helps with the really powerful poses. Ana Forest and Baron Baptiste give incredible core workouts in a gentle style. Am I forgeting anyone? Probably, but you get my point, there are lots of good CDs out there. Unfortunatly, this isn't one of them."
3,My first dslr lens,"I really enjoyed this lens for a little over a year. Great range for the price. Unfortunately as of last month mold developed on the inside of the glass, a huge bummer. my only point of criticism is that the zoom lock broke within the first weeks, didn't affect the pictures but it was kinda a pain because i couldn't carry my camera on my shoulder (with the strap) without the lens completely hanging out. overall, for the price it was great, but i'm probably going with tamron for my next lens (shooting on a pentax k100)."
2,Petmate,"I have two dogs who sleep in this bed. They have been able to eat the material off the bed, and the bed is weak. I would not recommend this bed for heavy dogs like a bulldog."
2,Not durable,I purchased three of these for my German Shepherds to use in their outdoor kennels during the day. They did not even last three months. The screws that hold the frame together sheared off on two of the beds and are impossible to replace. The third bed is still in use but shows signs of doing the same thing soon. I suppose they would be good for smaller dogs or for indoor use but I would not buy again.
1,"Broke within 1 month, useless","Don't waste your money! We thought these beds would be perfect for our two dogs, and we ordered extra large to accomodate their respective weights (both under 100 pounds). We bought a total of four beds and three of them broke within one month. Like other reviewers, we saw that the bolts sheared off and as a result, the beds are not able to be repaired. We have asked for a refund; I am optimistic..."
2,Not durable,"I got this bed because it doesn't contain any fluff or stuffing (which my three 5lb dogs like to demolish). It's supposed to be durable! But they began chewing it up right away. They like to chew on the fabric that connects to the rails. So when they finish chewing through it, there will be no fabric holding the bed up off the floor. I didn't have any bolts shear off though.It's also very difficult to clean. I would not purchase this again. My dogs have thrown up on it, pooped on it, and peed on it with no easy way for me to get it CLEAN. I want to throw it out and give them NO bed, but that seems mean so I will replace it with some other product that they will destroy in days."
3,Buy some heavier screws before you put this together!,"I don't own one of these, but after reading the reviews it seems that buying some heavy duty screws to use in place of the ones that are being sent with the bed might be a wise idea. Not sure why the manufacturer hasn't upgraded the screws themselves with all the bad feedback they must be recieving. Good Luck!"
2,"Nice bed, but they don't last long for the price","I have two Dalmatians, and I bought two beds. We had them for maybe two years. The dogs didn't care for laying on the flat bed surface, so I put pillow beds on top, and then they really loved their new beds. Most of the rubber grippers on the bottom fell off and disappeared. Also, the screws often loosened, causing the beds to shake. I frequently tightened the screws, but eventually, the screws must have come loose enough and several of the screws broke between the two beds. Now, I can't get the screws out, and the beds are worthless. They really are good quality beds, but you have to consistently tighten the screws if you don't want them to snap."
1,$59.99 down the drain. I would give it 0 star if I could.,I've had the bed one month and it is totaled. It was well on it's way in the first week. If you try to pick it up or move it it will collapse and all the frame connections come loose. The legs fold under just from the movment of the dogs (two whippets) getting on and off it.
3,"""Typical""","This was a typical Rotella book. Really, it is a compilation of statements made in his other books...""Golf is Not a Game of Perfect"",""Putting Out of Your Mind"", Golf is a Game of Confidence"", and ""The Golf of Your Dreams."" Now, I have six of his books (including Life is Not a Game of Perfect""; and, although enlightening, he's pretty much said it all a couple of times."
4,comfortable sleepware,this product is attractiveand comfortableand washes well-and the price is fair
2,Product Photo is misleading,"The dress is not as pink as in the picture, rather a dull color. Fitting was OK, wife likes the lace and cut at the top but giving low marks because of the shade."
5,"Sexy, cool, and doesn't break the bank","I love this, my husband loves it even more. Great little summer sleeper and it beats the heck out of a frumpy tee shirt. It does fit a little loose up top and a boob can fall out, but hub considers that a bonus."
3,Formulaic,"The story is interesting enough, but cliche and uninspiring. It fails to move beyond what amounts to typical romantic fiction formula. If you want romantic fiction that inspires you, read Susan Donovan's ""Take A Chance on Me"" instead."
5,Great DVD,great animated movie if you've haven't seen the movie yet go get it then read the comic book this movie was based on
2,Just Terrible,"Being a fan of the series and of the death comics, I thought this would be great but everything in this movie just came out so wrong that you are better off reading the comics and finding out what actually happend.I love Bruce Timm for Batman TAS and such but this movie by far his worst project yet."
3,I`ve a question guys!!,"Hi Guys... One Question, the lenguage is only in English?? with subtitles?? (Spanish, French?)"
2,Give us the REAL Superman,"Why can they not give us a movie, TV show, or even cartoon to match the comics? The Death of Superman story was brillant. For instance, the interview with Cat Grant and how it flashed back and forth to the Justice League getting beat up by Doomsday. I especially loved how the characters, Superman included, seemed like real people. How do film makers get this wrong? You have a great story with practically a storyboard already drawn out and they put this stuff out yet again. Give us the REAL Superman. Two out of five."
2,Superman Fan,"I own all the individual comics of superman, well all the good one anyway, and I was excited to hear that they were making an animated movie over the greatest comic of all time, The Death of Superman. After watching Superman Doomsday, I was very disappointed. The movie is called Superman Doomsday, but doomsday is only in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie then we never see or even hear of him again. I mean, the Doomsday creature that just killed Superman should get some mention, Right? If you're a fan of the comic don't pick this movie up and if you do, just watch the first 20 minutes or you will be in for a disappointing ride. DC you screwed the fans again, thanks."
2,Eh...,"I was very excited for this film and pre-ordered it. First of all, the designs for the characters, especially superman, were not all i could hope for. the story was weak and had very little emotional pull. I will say it had excellent action, was well animated, and had really nice special effects. But did not redeem the film.I respect an artist's choice to change a story from the source material. but at least do something interesting and clever. This is not worth purchasing. If you are a fan... i would rent it, or borrow it. but believe me your not missing much, missing it. Just go get Justice League on DVD and you will be better off."
2,Not what I expected,"I was a fan of the comic series of this story line and was very let down by this movie. Sure the action is intense (when it happens) and the voice acting is... okay... and the animation is what we have come to expect from the DC animated universe. The storyline has been changed to exclude all the JLA members who help fight Doomsday. Even Doomsday looks differnt...Fun fare for the kids, but don't get your hopes up."
3,Ehhh Jon Peters Strikes again,"Movie was half-way decent, acting was ok. i was disappointed as i am a huge superman fan and have every single issue relating to the death funeral and return of supz. I really was hoping they could do it justice, but without the inclusion of the justice league (who fill in for supes @ metropolis while hes dead) and pa kent (he's dead apparently?) no ""supermen"". could have been awesome, then again i see myself saying this with every new superman movie. oh well maybe next time. i originally was gonna give it 2 stars but the documentary with all the artist and writers from the comic book series deserved 5 stars. I dont understand why they couldnt just give kevin smith the opportunity to direct this animated film, he wouldve gotten it right."
4,A Decent Adaption...,"This adaption of the ""Death of Superman"" story was not bad. I don't think it's possible to translate the whole story from the graphic novel form to video, but the producers did a good job here. Thing is, this isn't ""Justice League Unlimited""; although you don't see much blood, the intimations of violence, death (some graphic, especially for kids,) and other, more deeply psychological themes, makes this a step up from the usual kids show fare. I recommend this for a watch and for collections; it does fair justice to a really strong story. One point worth mentioning is the unusual voice casting; James Marsters from ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" as Luthor (he plays him really evil here,) Anne Heche as Lois Lane and Adam Baldwin, most notably from ""Firefly"" as Superman/Clark. The whole thing casts a very dark shadow, but the story and action are a good balance."
2,Doom and gloom,"Hmmm...Wish I hadn't bought it really. Worth a rental maybe. Don't get me wrong, I'll always watch any kind of Superman feature but unfortunately, I did read the comics that this movie is based upon and as such, it comes up quite short. I won't go into this in depth as it's been said by all the other reviewers. Suffice to say, this could have been a great feature but seems overly rushed, short, and missing vital elements and characters of the original story which combined to make it the great series that it was. Mostly good animation, especially in fight scenes though like others, I'm mystified as to the drawing of the superman face and those lines....Have to say mostly, disappointing."
2,im not sure what happened,"wow Im not sure what happend here I had high hopes for the dvd but alas was disapointed. reading the superman comic was a pleasure the dvd on the other hand not so good an experience. the art was to hard superman looked sick as if drawn poorly, the characters seemed half deflated and it didnt fully suport the comic.the dvd was deffinatly someones nightmare of an inturpation it seemed rushed and like pieces were missing so if your expecting the comic to come to life on dvd you will be disapointed, i know i was. had i known how bad it was going to be,I have sent my money to support a diffrent team to create it"
3,The second half is worth it.,"This movie feels like it was written by two different people. The first half by a moron, and the second by the stellar team that brought you The Justice League. If you can get through the first half, the second half is a pretty good pay off. Worth the rental, if not worth the purchase."
2,Comic Adaptation,"I am by no means a purist, but they could have portrayed all the comic elements. It is a cartoon movie after all. And where was the Justice League? They helped fight Doomsday too, they were a critical aspect of the story. And the false Superman's'? No, this just did not do justice. I am sorry, it just did not. I know a lot of people liked it, 4/5 stars average rating, but I did not enough to write a review about it.I read a lot of comics, have watched most of the DC Animated Universe as well, Justice League Unlimited being my favorite. It on its own as a movie was entertaining, but not true at all to the actual story."
3,Doomsday,This is a good movie for comic book fans. It seems to be made separately than the justice league and previous films. It has good animation and a decent story line. The story line does not follow very closely to the books though. I would have like it more if it wouldn't have omitted as much stuff that happened in the books.
2,below average; do it right or not at all,"Allot is cut from the comics version, as it would have to be. The ""real"" story is just too big and long to fit into any single feature. Maybe a miniseries? Superman looks oddly shriveled and old; I don't care for the animation style. The cartoon is just a meh. This may have been a project that should have either been done right, including most of the comic book story, over several episodes, or not at all."
5,FUNNY!,"Anyone wanting a Hyacinth fix will want to get this tape! It's full of some of the funniest moments and comments of Hyacinth Bucket- or Bouquet, I should say."
5,A Compelling Modern Novel,"Admittedly, I have a strong bias for books dealing with chess. That aside, I can still recommend this book. On a superficial level it is a compelling read; on a deeper level its form is insightful and well suited to the nature of the tale.The fundamental ideas allegorically portrayed in the course of the novel are well suited to the themes Maurensig has chosen. While the philosophy proffered may not agree with that of the reader's, certainly its presentation is not objectionable.The approach to chess is the approach to life, and the case for the approach is well met. The weakest element of the novel is compensated for in its form: justification of the characters' actions is delivered not by the author, but the reader.It is not a long novel; and certainly worth the time spent reading."
5,As complex - and satisfying - as a great game of Chess,"Robert P. Beveridge, the reviewer just before me (and a ""top"" reviewer at that), doesn't get the end of this book. If you've read the book carefully, the ending is perfectly clear and perfectly just. I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment by explaining the end, because I think the reasonably intelligent and literate reader is capable of figuring it out for himself. Suffice it to say, like great chess, or like any valuable work of art for that matter, EVERY detail counts. Pay attention, and you will be richly rewarded. I'm on my second reading, and my pleasure in the Luneburg Variation only grows.I also think the reviewers who made a lot out of the concentration camp scenes miss the point. The book isn't about Nazis, Jews, the Holocaust, etc., at all. The author needs all that for the mise-en-scene, but the book is really ultimately about chess itself and what it can mean."
5,Among top 10,"I have read about 60 trading/investment books during the last 5 years. Every book had something to give. Some very little and some a lot. No 1 for me is still ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"". After that it is harder to grade them. This book I would rank somewhere in the top 10 area. It is said that in order to become sucessful in the markets and to over time take out more than you put in, you must find an approach that fits your nature and, somewhere, the nature of the markets. ""Taming the Lion"" gave me insights and helped me on the way to my personal approach."
1,Not a How to Book,"This is the first book I have ever returned to Amazon. I was looking for a book to tell me ""How To"". This book is more advertising than anything else."
2,"It works, but it's a remanufactured generic","Although the product description said it was a Konica-Minolta cartridge, it was not. It was a remanufactured, compatible cartridge by LD Products. I felt deceived, tricked. It is working fine, so for a remanufactured cartridge it is probably a good one, but if I would have known it was not and actual Konica-Minolta cartridge i would not have bought it.Will be more careful buying from Amazon in the future."
2,Could have been better ...,"Overall the game is ok but the story is so fart fetch that buying the game just for the story content its not worth it. The graphics are great and choosing from all the different pros in the game is really a great feature that the series has kept since the begining. But the story is just not good, any real skater will stay away from this game. If you are a Tony Hawk fan or Bam Margera fan this game will suit you, if not, grab your skateboard and go shred rather than buy this game."
2,Wipeout....,"This game is weak. Thats it, there is nothing else.If you like to skateboard this a game for you but if you just want to check out the game, dont buy it. Rent it"
2,Don't waste your time.,"I purchased this tape as I had seen the history of the man that created the automatic weapon in a North Carolina historical expo. The film is fine, but the acting is really poor. Oh well I dodn't buy it for the acting."
1,Movie: great. Media junk,"It seems like the greed of the movie studios strikes again. In their constant attempts to stem piracy they have made the movie inaccessible on a PC. I can watch the movie on a DVD player, but cannot watch it on my PC. I will not buy a product that will not allow me to play it on the player of my choice. I take DVDs with me to watch in hotels when I am out of town. This is one that eliminates that possibility.When are these idiot going to realize that many of these pirated copies were never going to be sales to begin with? For free they take. For ""buy"", don't bother. Every pirate copy also exposes the movie and may actually turn it into a sale. But in this case, the revenue they believe they gained they have lost because I will not buy products with this draconian scheme that limits my playback options. It is a rip off to charge me for something that is intentionally nonfunctional on PCs."
2,too many hits...,"Unlike the other reviewers I was seriously disappointed with this CD. Incredibly boring riffage that goes absolutely nowhere, buried vocals (moreso than DOPETHRONE), lame piano, and some ridiculous swirling effects. They're either burned out or have become too lazy from smoking too much weed to care about the music. ""We cane harder.""--Here, here! and look what happens when that's all that matters: the music suffers. DOPETHRONE is a faaaaarrrr superior album in comparison. ""Let us Prey"" for a better album next time."
4,"""el ahora o nada""...","Estaba leyendo La Meditación y El libro de La Nada de Osho cuando me regalaron El Poder del Ahora. Encontré muchas y sorprendentes similitudes. Cabe destacar que Eckart aporta un punto de vista práctico, un punto de partida en el que las enseñanzas de Osho también se enriquecen. Osho plantea el ahora como un ejercicio que todos debemos dominar para ser. Eckart plantea radicalmente ""el ahora o nada"". El manejo del contenido a partir de preguntas del público nos lleva a una reiteración algo circular en busca de aclarar detalles que al final tampoco parecieran claros para el mismo autor. La forma en que el mismo se auto explica no es tan accesible sin un diccionario Tolle. Debido a que el material de Osho es más viejo, también es más fácil asimilar, conocimiento menos desesperado y mas redondeado.Recomiendo que cualquiera interesado en El Poder del Ahora lea también La Meditación y El libro de La Nada de Osho.SaludosOscar"
5,:D,purchased this as a gift. Hope they get the most out of it and that they are blessed as a result :D
2,Not what I thought,"My dog had this frisbee gone in about 5 minutes, not as tough as I thought it would be."
4,out of print,too bad they dont make this album anymore. i discovered her music about 10 years ago. her voice and the production of the album is outstanding. it reminds me of childhood. i wish i was a grown up when the 80's was around. luckilly for me i own this album.
4,Operation Amsterdam,all I can say this movie was done very well it is a believable movie a good world war ll movies everything about it was done very well.I would give this movie**** stars.
5,Great aid to keep you on the right path,This is a great aid to keep your life going in the right direction. If you haven't read Matthew Kelly start here and then send him and email and ask for more great reads.
1,Want to get fired for being late?,"My husband is about to be fired for being late to work. Alarm 2 is not working consistently. I called 800-531-0039 and they will exchange but I have to send the unit in first. Then they will send a replacement. They do not have a loaner alarm. I told them if I wanted to go buy an alarm I wouldn't have called them first. By-the-way, this is the 2nd unit. I had to exchange the 1st one because it was malfunctioning also. Too bad for Philips...we are about to purchase a big screen TV and a DVD player."
4,"A whole lotta good, a litttle bit not so good.","All the good things people have said...they are true. This is a nice clock radio. I could repeat what has already been said, but why. It is all true. I liked everything about it that everyone else had said.But..................Yes, it beeps loud when you shut it off. The memory backup is very short, good for a flicker, but not for an outage. If you have an outage and have to reset the whole thing, its a pain, especially when it has been a while and you dont really remember how you did it the last time. BUT my biggest complaint......it is bright! it has 3 level of display brightness. the lowest is still way too bright. it lights up my whole bedroom. i like it dark. DARK! This thing keeps me awake for hours if i dont cover it up......then i cant see it in the morning or cant hear it untill it gets louder......"
1,Great Sound?....NOT!,"I purchased this unit on the basis of the reviews I read here. Almost every person commented on how great this thing sounded. Well I'm here to tell you that this CD clock radio sounds TERRIBLE! The sound is way too bass heavy and muddy. Even modest program material on a CD, like acoustic guitar sounds distorted even at low volume. Frankly, I cannot imagine how anyone can say this sounds good, never mind great! I took it back to the store where I bought it and compared it to 10 other CD clock radios in the general price range and it was easily the worst sounding one there.This is a true bummer because everything else about this CD clock radio was fine.Bottom line, a nicely featured box with HORRIBLE sound."
1,Avoid the refurbished ones!,"At all costs, if you purchase this model, AVOID the ""factory refurbished"" models. Here's why:First, the CD player for my unit did not work at all. It thought every CD I put in it was a cd-r, which, to my surprise, it does not play.Second, the speakers had far too much bass sound, and no way to lower/adjust it. Sound was muddy and muffled at best.Finally, reception was not great. Unless you live on a hill, forget trying to get anything but your area's strongest radio signals."
3,Horrible for the price,"I won't ramble on about the details of this clock.My main gripe is the disply... TOO BRIGHT!And the buttons aren't ""sleepy-head"" friendly.Not easy to turn on and off in the dark, at all.I do love the 2 different alarms you can set though and how it knows not to go off on the weekend."
1,FAULTY PRODUCT,DO NOT BUY THIS CLOCK RADIO! I purchased this and gave it as a birthday gift. Two months later the CD player died without warning. And it wasn't even used on a daily basis. At most three to four days a week.I have looked back at the other reviews listed here and found I am not alone. This is a poorly made product and chances are it will break for you too.
2,Way too complicated,"Waking up in the morning shouldn't require a PhD in Electronics or Computer Programming. This clock radio requires both. Look at its picture and take note of the number of push buttons. After you do that, take into consideration that there is no HELP function for any of those buttons, so you have to learn by trial and error. Not fun. If you buy this clock radio because of its brand and because it looks cool (as I did) be sure to keep the User's Manual nearby. You'll need to refer to it often."
2,2.5 stars actually,"i am satisfied with this clock, particularly for the sound quality and the varios features such as two alarms, battery backup, etc.what i do not like about this clock is that you cannot see this time display. Unless you are looking straight at the display, the numbers are faded and cannot be read. Also the backlight display is very bright and annoying. Its very frustrating and I would probably pick a different clock in the future."
2,Acceptable CD clock radio,"This radio has a nice design making it pleasing to the eye, and it does have a good sound. I also found the green backlit display comforting at first. However, it is difficult to see the numbers at night unless able to look level with the clock. As I have it set up on a stand and need to look slightly up to see it, the numbers appear fuzzy. I also found the lack of a battery backup disturbing, along with the fact that it is not mentioned. It's an okay clock radio but not one I would spend the money on again."
4,Ok,"I'm an at-home fitness dvd addict and own over 100 different styles from old-school Cindy Crawford to Tamilee Webb to Tracy Anderson...Kendra's dvd is divided into five simple 6 minute sections with different themes (basketball, football, soccer, etc.). The moves are very easy to follow and Kendra has a refreshing honest can-do spirit but for an intermediate to advanced exerciser the program lacks weights, toning and anything particularly innovative or challenging. There is NO use of free weights or bands or other toning equipment....even on my first try of the video I added 5lb weights and a 4lb fitness ball to use on the basketball section (if you're a bit creative incorporating weights is not too difficult and really increases the burn).This video is primarily for newbie exercisers who want a fun albeit simple cardio program."
2,Not worth it...,"I bought these for my daughter for her 4th birthday. She loves dress-up and loves Disney Princesses. The shoes are very cute and length-wise, they are okay for a 4 yr. old, but they are so narrow, she can't even get her toes in them. We have other Disney Princess dress-up shoes, and they fit her fine, but these will probably never be worn."
4,Value for Money,"I bought it for my 5D2 for the approaching offroad trips in AZ & UT. I forgot to take my huge 28-300L with me when I took the flight to US, so I have to buy a tele-lens here with very limited budget for my offroad photograhy trip.I have a tripod, so I make my mind to try this 28-300 without OS feature at the price of $209.Generally speaking, this len's quality is good and value for its price. The focus is not accurate, I put a +10 offset in my 5D2 lens auto-focus setting menu to correct it. After that, the pic is sharp. I benmark it with 24-105L at the 28mm; 100mm. The focus and the color are good considering its price. I will keep it if it doesn't die after my trip.Love the auto focus offset feature of 5D2. It makes the Sigma 28-300 works very well."
5,Wonderful reading!,"A most wonderful book. St. Gregory of Nyssa is one the best known Saints of the Holy Orthodox Church, and his ""Life of Moses"" is a must for all Orthodox Christians. The cover of the book is handicapped by a hideous picture, but the contents far overshadow the horrible cover, which is unfortunately standard for all publishings in this series. A great and Spiritually beneficial work at a good and affordable price."
3,Great if complex recipes appeal to you,"This book has new, complex or somewhat complex recipes for the most part. Many are original or have original flairs to them. Preferring simplicity, I didn't buy this book when it first came out. The only recipe I really wanted it for was the very differnt, although somewhat complex, turkey leg recipe(s). I recently ordered it for the turkey leg treatment(s), now that the price is less expensive."
1,Worst Slow Cooker Cookbook I Own,"As an experienced cook who has won an award for cooking, I have had disappointment after disappointment with this book. There is nothing terribly new in it, and I have given it many chances. Flavors and textures are wrong, rice and beans have stuck in both the Spanish Rice and Black Bean Soup recipes. There's nothing worse than coming home tired from work and having a disappointing supper.Nothing very innovative, just twists on simple classics...but the twists are not improvements."
4,Easy Recipes,"Recipes are so easy. However, so many of the recipes are for the medium cookers and I think most of today's cookers are really large so you have to double the recipes."
2,Its hit or miss(with mostly misses),"I have tried a half dozen of these recipes and have only like one well enough to repeat.The red lentil soup was tasteless. A teaspoon of cumin for 6 cups of liquid is just not right. The carrot soup with honey and nutmeg was absolutely horrible. It was litterly a big bowl of strained, tasteless, carrot mush. Again not enough seasoning. The Cock-a-Leek ie Soup was indescribably bad. The only soup recipe so far that I liked was the Chicken Tortilla Soup.Tonight I got a little bolder and tried the Lamb Goulash au Blanc. I knew when I put all those lemons in there that this would bad. (yes they were very thin slices) What a waste of 2 lbs of lamb. Bitter and disgusting.I really wanted to like this book but unfortunately this one goes in the garage sale pile."
3,Great gift book,Beautiful book with color photos. Receipes tend to be world-wide foods. Not many standard dishes.
2,Multi-step recipes add too much complexity to the Slow Cooker,"I am very disappointed with this cookbook. I thought the point of a slow-cooker was simplicity, but these recipes require a lot of work to prepare the food before it even gets to the slow cooker. Some even require the meat to be cooked before being put in the crock pot. I have to use a lot of pots and pans and bowls to prepare the food so there is just as much cleanup using these recipes as using traditional recipes. (Even more - because I have to clean the crock pot, too!) I have made 3 dishes, and each of the flavors have been a little too mild. Not enough flavor. This cookbook is for those who want their meals hot and ready when they come home at 5pm, but who are willing to do a full meal's worth of preparation beforehand."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,I have tried several of the recipes in the book - some work and some don't. Unfortunately you don't know until you try a recipe. The pasta recipes proved unsuccessful yet the pork and beef were pretty good. I will keep trying but I wouldn't recommend this cookbook.
5,Favorite Slow Cooker Cookbook,"I also love my slow cookers, and this is the best cookbook I've found for them (ironically, it was a gift from my mom). I've tried many recipes from this book and they have all been very tasty, with the exception of the oatmeal, which I've since decided was just was not meant for slow cookers. One extra bonus is that my husband has liked every meal from this cookbook as well. The recipes are not shy in terms of spices so if you're cooking for children, you may want to reduce spice amounts. I also like the slow cooker books by Judith Finlayson, but this one is even more reliable. Particular favorites are the chili section, the butternut squash soup, and Skye's pot roast. Enjoy!"
1,There's more to good food than adding weird kinds of alcohol...,"The ""not your mother's"" part of this book is that all the recipes involve some kind of weird liquor that you probably don't have in the house. Other than that, the recipes are fairly bland."
3,"More talk than help, but adequate.","Since my slow cooker was new, I'm glad I ordered a cookbook too.Much too ""wordy"", but more than adequate to get me started.Some directions were a bit confusing, i.e. vegatable on top ofmeat, and then vegatables under the meat, but it all worked out.Maybe not exactly a ""starter"" book, but got me through my firstslow-cooking experience."
2,Not very useful,"There's not much else to say-this is not a very useful cookbook! My family is not picky,but we just didn't enjoy these recipes.The most disappointing aspect of the book was how long and involved the recipes were,and I usually love to spend time cooking.I'm not even sure how to explain how disappointed I am with it.Maybe it's just me,but I am really sorry I spent the money on this."
3,Not impressive,"Recipes seem okay but the vibe of the book is honestly, ""dull"". I would have appreciated pics just to entice the senses & make the book alittle more appealing. I dont often use the crock pot for much other than keeping nacho cheese sauce warm, so I'm looking forward to testing this out. So far, by glancing at it, I'm not impressed."
4,Not Your Mother's cook book,"I thought this was a wonderful collection of recipes. I received this as a gift when I along with a very nice croc pot. The fat can often be reduced with no harm to the recipes. I found that Many of these recipes require a lot of prep, not to be confused with a throw it all in the crockpot and forget about it for 6 hours, but the prep is worth it. Lots of flavor and goodness! This is a wonderful cookbook with fantastic, delicious recipes. The only drawback is that they are often high in fat ( and no nutritional data is given for the recipes."
5,South Beach Diet and Soccer Mom Compatible,"This book is great. I used to think you had to fill the crock pot all the way to the top with liquid to cook, but I'm learning that there is a better way. The recipes fit my needs -- I can start something earlier in the day, and it frees me up in the afternoon when I'm chauffeuring the kids around. It is nice to get home from a softball game and have dinner ready. And since the recipes use fresh ingredients, they are easily adaptable to be compatible with the South Beach Diet!"
2,Not My Mother's slow cooker cookbook indeed!,"Of course it's not my mother's slow cooker recipe book! 'Cause Mom is a great cook and this one is full of mediocrity. I understand that it's an upgrade from the usual ""add a packet of onion soup to a hunk of meat and cook for 10 hours"" type of book, but for someone who is an accomplished home cook this recipe collection is lackluster.Crocked Corn bread is cloyingly sweet. Overnight oatmeal turned into 2 inch think crust on the sides with a bit of gooey stuff in the middle. Polenta did turn out ok. Old Fashioned Apple Sauce Cake had a great moist texture but lacked in flavor completely.This book has been a good idea source for other uses of my slow cooker (Baking quick breads!) but I will be using my own recipes to execute those ideas in the future.Would never recommend it to anyone."
2,Thought this would be a 'normal' cooks cookbook!,"I'm not impressed with the cookbook at all. When I saw it on Amazon I couldn't wait to order it because it really looked good and had pretty much good reviews.I only found about 4-5 recipes in the entire book that I'd make. I'm not a gourmet chef but I am a simple home cook, I like ingredients that you can use over and over again. In every recipe in this book there are ingredients that are not only expensive but that I'd probably only use once or twice ever! I hate that!This book is going right back up for sale, I guess I need to research the cookbooks a bit more before I jump in and buy them!!"
3,Look before you buy,"Since this is a cookbook, I should have looked through a copy before I purchased. Many of the recipes do not feature a full day of cooking in the crockpot. Therefore, they can't be used on a workday."
2,a few decent takes on standards,"I have better luck adapting regular recipes myself. The text is poorly written, the recipes seem chosen to include as much pre- and post- cooking labour as possible, but most of all the food just isn't exciting."
4,Pretty nice,GNR seems to be very quiet and TRUTH in this video. They speak seriously and Axl explain how the song have been figured out. If you like this song you had to buy this video!
5,"Review of ""Estranged""","I've had a chance to see, ""Making, part IV"". I think this video was the hardest for GNR to make, as there were scenes in the ocean. I enjoyed seeing the band work with the dolphins and I was amazed that the part where Axl swims with the dolphins took place in a wave pool! If you enjoy learning how a video is made, then you will enjoy this one. I also liked that GNR closed off one of Hollywood's busiest streets to make this video!"
4,better than toad stool,"This is a great compilation no doubt. All the hits you've heard on the radio, and more. ""Something's always wrong"", ""Walk on the ocean"", and ""Crazy life"" are all here. I only wish it included a bit more from the first two albums. In fact if your looking for their best record, minus the radio songs, I highly suggest ""Pale"". It is the best thing to listen to sitting in your car at the county park on a summer night while enjoying a Dr.Pepper and a smoke. Oh yeah, and Toad is many times better than the Gin blossoms."
3,Old Fashioned and patronizing,"I read ""Tales of Edisto"" in preparation for a trip South to visit some Civil War historical sites and enjoy the beautiful beaches of South Carolina. This book, written in the mid 50's reflects a time period prior to Civil Rights and desegregation. While the history of the island before and directly after the Civil War is highly anecdotal, that part made for a relatively interesting read.The rest of the book is a cacophony couched in the patronizing language of the times. While it is sort of interesting from that perspective, it is clearly way out of date!"
2,Too much alien mysticism ruined it.,"The first book, The Dark Wing was much better, it concentrated more on the space navy side of things and whether or not we commit genocide to save both species. This one is just totally bizarre throughout much of it."
4,VOHT is the definition for Perfect Seattle Rap,"We bought this CD from the artists themselves, off the corner of a gas station for 10 bucks. Boy was it worth it...My personal favorite is Lotta Rain. They are the next best thing out of Seattle , following Baby C."
3,"""Back in the Red"" movie!","Yes, you heard me, this is the show's first three-part adventure, a terrific movie that brings back the indispensible Arnold Rimmer along with the Red Dwarf mining ship and its entire crew! Holly's back too! Heck, even the scutters are back!This epic is a mostly succesful attempt to put the show back on track. Although everyone gets something to do, the focus is once again on Lister and Rimmer, the odd couple of space.What really makes this show work is that underneath all that gadgetry, it's really about two mismatched roommates trying to get along. Why the Sci-FI Channel won't pick up this gem is beyond me."
1,JUST DON'T DO IT!!!,"I can't believe a company like Sony would put out such a TRASH product. It must have been consumer trialed by robots and designed by a sadist. The ""ear pieces"" are so uncomfortable you can't stand to wait and listen to the sound quality as you're ripping them off from the pain. Sony should engage an international recall and refund whatever you paid for this piece of junk.I plan to report it to Consumer Reports and see if they can stop this injustice!"
5,love it,I really like this product. It is not greasy like most sunscreens and keeps my face moisturized. I sometimes put another moisturizer on underneath but I have pretty dry skin.
4,Opened? Used?,"I have purchased this through Amazon for my wife and got it today. She did not use it yet, but it looks like the perfume has been opened and used? how comes you sell a refillable bottle OPENED AND USED! How do we know it was not refilled with garbage???The package itself should contain a code to register it online. The code is inside the bottle package and has been cut out with a knife. That is how we knew it has been used and opened. Did not expect this from a reputable site like Amazon!EDIT:Amazon have fixed it professionally. As far as the perfume itself, my wife loved it."
1,complete scam!!!,"Don't even bother wasting your money!!! I have been using this perfume for years and when I noticed Amazon had it for a MUCH cheaper price than the department stores, I decided to give it a try.First of all...there were finger prints all over the bottle before I even touched it! Then I noticed the registration code inside the top of the box that had clearly been cut out and when i tried to spray it, it was already clogged!! When i managed to finally get it to work, it was SO obvious that it had been watered down!I was disappointed to say the least...Especially since it was coming straight from Amazon!!"
2,Too much of the same.,I bought this product looking for some new and different fonts but found that most of them I already have.
1,Didn't Entertain Me,"I have to say that this was a pretty poorly written book. I love a good romantic suspense novel as much as the next reader, but I found myself skimming through page after page, and finally towards the end, I skipped a whole chapter or two. First of all, the romance between the two main characters was contrived at best. There was just no reason why these two should or would have gotten together. I just didn't feel any attachment there. A couple of times the author jumped to a totally different venue mid-paragraph. Bottom line, I just could never cozy up and really lose myself in this book. I kept plugging away as long as I could though, because I hate to spend money on a book I don't read, but I finally skipped to the end and even that was a let-down. Check this one out at the library and save your money is my advice."
2,Not Worth the Buy,"Well at first i was upset that my case just came in some plastic little bag where it could have broken because this product is sort of cheap. It did not fit the phone properly. The top of the case would not shut, thus it would open up more. I did drop it once saving me from any scratches but it still opened all up. Would not recomment, try a leather case or something else."
2,Disappointed with book,This was not the book I thought it was. This author tells very disjointed and personal stories that do not give the type of personal info I was looking for regarding the beatles from the beginning. It is my own fault. I did not read the title very well. It is more of a story of Tony Bramwell than of the Beatles. Very disappoiting.
4,"""Dear sir or madam will you read my book....""","Tony Bramwell does a fantastic job of telling the in depth activties of the Beatles as kids to before the break up. I've read so many books and seen so many movies, I thought it was impossible for me to learn anything new, but I was proved wrong. The only thing I didn't enjoy about the book was that, due to Tony's closeness with Brian Epstien and NEMS, there is a lot of useless info about other bands they managed, as well as things going on at NEMS that have nothing whatsoever to do with the Beatles. He does however, give some insight into Brian's personal life, which is interesting. Once again, the book offers many things that went on in the Beatles personal lives from the activies of the young Paul McCartney when he found out he was in the band to the REAL truth about Yoko Ono. It's a great and intriguing book to read for any big Beatles fans."
3,general readers only,"a bit padded - if only there were no word 'journalism', and no such style - but an easily readable introduction to the phenomenon of bots in MUDs and Usenet & such, suitable (only) for the uninitiated. it would have to be more complex to be of serious intellectual interest, and much has happened since that is not in this 1997 book. still, there are many uninitiated out there, and it serves a purpose for those who think the computer age is defined by the replacement of the typewriter by the word processor, and calculation, calculation."
3,Ambivalent Surprise,"I believed that this book was about robotics. Although not in-depth enough for this techie, this is one of the only general introductions to Software Bots or Agents that I have seen. If you want a fair introduction to the genesis of Bots this book will serve you, however you will not find pseudo code; math; or even modern coverage of bot technology. Overall the book leaves me ambivalent."
2,All frills and fluff,This book is very lighthearted. The information is not groundbreaking so don't expect to read this book and become some kind of seductress.
2,Picture is not good,"The picture is terrible...I also have a Kodak Easy Share SV11 and the picture is so much clearer. With the Coby my pics looked grainy, and just plain strange - people's faces looked spotty. I would definitely buy something with a higher resolution."
4,Very nice photo frame for the money,"I was looking for something affordable with good quality. This frame fits that description. It is easy to use, has some basic options, and the clarity is just fine. I brought it to work for a while and put my vacation photos on slide show. Then I brought it back home - love the portability of it. Makes a good gift, too. I am going to get one for my mother so she can have a variety of photos of her grandchildren continuously running."
1,Absolutely unusable,"I bought this thing for my mother in 2007 and it has NEVER worked correctly. We've tried Mac and Windows, direct feed and SD card reader, etc. It will not play correctly, either photos or music. It puts a bunch of undeletable junk on the card and doesn't allow you to skip or program it to see or hear what you want to hear."
1,cheap plastic cheap,"Straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality. Plug into wall and does not work. After trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on. After putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable. The mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and I was only playing very quiet jazz. This is not worth the money even though it is cheap. Pay a little more and get one that is of better quality."
4,Nice piece of kit!,Lovely peice of kit at a great price! Easy to use. Good quality and makes for hours of enjoyment!
3,Decent frame for the money,"This is a decent frame. Picture quality is acceptable and the slideshow is nice. It is very easy to use/navigate. My only complaint is that since it is a 16:9 frame, for your regular digital camera pictures to be viewed on it, you will have to size them down and crop them to 478x268 to be viewed correctly."
1,VERY BAD CHOICE,The seller sent me only 1 frame while in the description it was mentioned that the item was going to be shipped with a white and a black frame.The quality is very poor. This time I was really disappointed by the seller and I strongly advice not to but this item as it's a complete waste of money
5,Nice and a great deal,Nice features: It even takes Sony memory stick. Also played video and music as bonus.The speaker can be better but audio is really secondary.
3,"ah, too short",Sister Wendy is great an all but these cuts are so short. under 10 min? but .... oh well. maybe they'll get it right one day.
5,"an emotional, hard rock performance","This album is a must for any fan. CRegg seems to be playing his 12-string more on this album. Has two slower tracks in ""Everything"" and ""This Song for You"". The rest of the album is standard BHC stuff, which is amazing. I personally like ""Forever and a Day"", ""The Passage"", ""The Sound of a Breaking Heart"". I like them all really."
4,runs a bit small,"I love the style and quality of this sandal. It is well padded. However, I ordered the size my daughter usually wears and it is too small. I should have gotten at least a half size larger."
1,"THE ""REAL COSTANZA"" IS COULDNT BE MORE FAKE","Any true Seinfeld fan knows and appreciates the fact that George Costanza is based off Larry David, as it has been known from the start. The only thing Jerry used was his last name. Don't feel bad for this guy, hes getting money for a book which is phoney."
3,"Not a bad lens, but not what I wanted.","When I purchased this lens, I overlooked the fact that it was made for macro shooting. In that regard, the lens works fine with perhaps a little softness when fully zoomed. However, I was hoping to find a lens that worked as well as the 75-300mm lens that came with my a100. Unfortunately, this lens fails to clearly capture objects at distances, which may have been asking too much of it on my part."
3,Some common sense written out,"This book was basically filled with common sense ideas for connecting with your daughter. I found some cute ideas that I may impliment in my own home, however, for the most part the book was filled with things that good parents should be doing anyway.This book is worth reading if for no other reason than a gentle reminder of what Dad's should be doing if they've been caught up in the fast pace of life."
4,Practical orientation,"Dr. Trent offers a plethora of practical ideas and ways for a dad to connect with his daughters during pre-adolescence and the teenage years. Not every idea will work for every father-daughter relationship, but every dad will find a few ideas for better connecting with his little girl."
4,Xenosaga special edition dvd,"The actual game is great, but its takes a long time to play through (approx 80 hours). This dvd is good for saving you the time of actually playing through it (or a second play through), and you still get to watch all the high quality cut scenes. However, I still recommend getting the game, because there is a lot of things left out in the movie."
5,"Clear, well-written, very well done.","This books makes a lot of interesting points. And thankfully, it's easy to read and understand, despite the fact that it touches on some rather unique topics, e.g., the use of thought-field therapy to overcome fitness obstacles.This book was recommended to me by a friend, who while reading it, was surprised to find that his pattern of sleep could limit his gains in the gym. It made me aware of some things, as well, that I'd never even considered. Many points to ponder here - highly recommended!"
3,High-level view,"The author is trying to cover a lot of bases in this book. I felt the book did not contain anything new or anything I could not have read in a thousand other books. The writing itself is, for me, a bit hokey, and I have yet to be able to complete reading it (though I have tried) for that reason."
5,"Clever format, compelling insights.","What impresses me most about this book is the way it provides perspective. The author is right on the mark when he says that we must ""seek and find our own paths."" This point is unusually clear in this book, in a way that transcends common sense. Also, this book isn't preachy or dense; it just offers food for thought. While it covers (and breaks) a great deal of new ground, it never digs needlessly deep. For the most part, it steers clear of jargon and offers direction in simple terms.This book has an honest, sensible tone that for me, has enormous appeal. I suggest that you visit a bookstore and give it a serious look. I bet that once you start reading it, you won't want to put it down."
5,This book is used as the course text for Intro to Soils @ UC,This book is an excellent resource for anyone interested or majoring in soil science. It provides the basis for soil morphology and introduces some soil chemistry concepts. It is recommended without reservation.
5,"""Setting The Sail"" - a review of only ONE track","This is a wonderfully performed and recorded CD from the old Nonesuch label. The 21 minute track ""Gending Bonang Babar Layar (Setting The Sail)"" has been one of my favorite pieces of music for DECADES. It is a textbook lesson in gamelan theory - read the liner notes while listening. It is some the STONGEST playing I have ever heard from musicians East or West. And when the lead bonang (which I think is the conducting instrument)sounds out the notes of the main theme and propels the orchestra into faster and faster iterations of this theme leading to this piece's conclusion - it is absolutely magnificent. It's chilling. Oh, and the rest of the album is pretty good, too. This CD belongs in the music library of any truly civilized human."
3,Too much personal bias,"Good reading for a moderate Christian, particularly one who is faced with extremists who make claims of the ""every word of the Bible is 100% accurate and true,"" nature. Not so good for someone interested in objective truth without agenda-driven spin.It is clear the author attempts to be fair. He fails. He is unable to present the material objectively, and freely throws in his own speculation about what various dead people ""meant"" or ""thought,"" and (despite his initial claims) makes repeated attempts to assert not just the truth about what is in the Bible, but also that the contents of the Bible are true.An honorable undertaking, but his inability to divorce himself from his emotional and spiritual involvement in the subject yields a load of apologist twaddle covered in a lace (i.e. mostly holes) shawl of science and truth."
1,Am I surprised!,Here is a lucky guy with a couple of solo 33 rpm albums of Ms Suzuki! Some less known singers have many reissues of their album... Not her? A shame!
2,"Good Concept, but...","The idea seems good, but when you are in the shower, the tablet needs to be directly under the water. This does not allow you to receive much of the water. Also, the vapors tend to bypass the nostrils and goes straight to the eyes, which causes slight tearing and a burning sensation. Lastly the tablet heats up and you can't touch it at all, which also keeps you away from the water. Sorry that I can't give this product a higher rating, it has too many flaws.God bless!"
1,History/ Landskenechts/ Etc,"This is one of the only fims I've ever seen that depicts Landskenechts. The rest are in German, If you like Rutger Hauer or Medieval Germany this film is for you. I've watched it -many- times and never get tired of it."
4,"Good flavor, too many calories.","I really like these bars, they taste good, but have a little too many calories for just a snack. They are pretty filling, but I can't have them around because I like them too much and I eat too many! Ha!"
4,A boy and the swallows of San Juan Capistrano.,This children's book won the 1950 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a book for children. The story concerns a boy named Juan in southern California who comes to love the swallows that fly to San Juan Capistrano each year. He is sad at first when they leave but discovers how happy he feels when they return.
3,A good look at Labor and its decline,"""American Dream"" breaks your heart. No matter what side of the labor movement you are on, if you are for or against it, you see its toll on the people involved, but also the hope it instills in a group. Personally, as a pro-union man who thinks that unions actually have a place in our society and are not something of the past, I felt that the movie also showed the lack of solidarity within the movement. Instead of a concrete effort to defeat Hormel, the union was set against itself somewhat at first, without the backing of the international. That, I believe, speaks to all people in society. You cannot accomplish things if you are not united... a good lesson no matter what walk of life someone is from, and something totally unrelated to unions that this movie tells."
3,A bit different than most Hepburn/Tracy movies,I was wondering why I had not heard of this one. One one of their collective best but still an interesting story.
5,Media Manager,I have one of these wallets for my DVD/CDs and it's almost full. I needed one quickly so I picked this up at a really nice price. Any media wallet will manage your media very wll and will do away with the cases that you maybe using now.
3,Not that great for cars,"This case looks very nice, but the cds are hard to get in and out, and if you're not careful, the zipper will scratch them. I've definitely had better cases."
5,Amazing Lil CD Case,"I have started a little collection of CDs because I cannot download music. The problem is that I don't have much storage, so I needed something to keep my new collection in.I absolutely love this CD case. Not only does it look sleek, and certainly not cheap, but it's big enough to hold the CD with the booklet that has the music lyrics of the album. (I have to download these CDs on my desktop and because I don't have internet access for this it doesn't tell me the name of the songs.) It's perfect because it's small, pink and able to do the job.It will be even better when I am able to go home and have it in my car. All of my CDs are jumbled up in my center console, so I will be able to organize them and save some space :)"
5,Great product,"This wrist support does the trick. It is comfortable and soft. It puts the wrist in the correct position while using the mouse, but is not restrictive like a brace. This isn't a treatment for someone with carpel tunnel, it's a tool to improve the ergonomic situation of your workspace so you don't GET carpel tunnel. And for that, it's perfect.Unlike a previous review, I am not finding that it smells bad or gets soiled easily, even after everyday use. I've had mine for six months now and have only washed it once - it's absolutely fine. I'm on here buying a second one after accidentally leaving my original one at a coffee shop. :/"
4,computer glove,"This is a good glove, very comfy to wear. Not meant for tiny/ really slim hands. It gives good support to the wrist when using the computer. Not meant to be a wrist band."
1,Simply doesn't work.,"I have the same problem SirAdam had. The device sends a constant signal of down and/or left. So, for example, if I'm playing Super Mario, you'll see mario constantly running to the left of the screen and theres nothing I can do about it. The product feels like its cheaply made... I imagine my problem is a common defect."
4,THIS IS A BOOK WELL WORTH READING AND APPLYING,"THIS BOOK IS AN INSPIRATION TO ANYONE LOOKING TO CHANGE THEIR MIND, BODY AND/OR SPIRIT. IT FOCUSES ON KEY ELEMENTS OF LIFE-AND HOW TO LIVE IT MORE ABUNDANTLY. I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF HEARING TOM BAY SPEAK AND HE IS QUITE A MOTIVATOR; HIS REAL LIFE PASSION FOR OTHERS REALLY SHOWS IN THIS BOOK! I HAVE SHARED AND PASSED IT ALONG TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS. GREAT FOR ANYONE WHO IS 'IN TRANSITION'."
5,id love to live in dibbley,i tell all my friends they must watch this.. the characters are all so realatable. then add the british accent. you have a winning show
4,Terrific!,"This is a soundtrack from the documentary Frontier Life a collaboration across the USA-Mexico border between Trummerflora artists and members of the Nortec Collective. The music is mostly in the electronica vein, minimal techno and experimental dub forming its core with contributions from artists like Panóptica, Clorofila and Latinsizer. The best music comes from those who push things further. Fjellestad's own 'Phone Damage' is a very fine layering of odd ambiances."
3,He didn't perform the symphonies according to the score,"yes, i know his new recordings of Beethoven's 9 Symphony use the new fullscores which revised by Jonathan Del Mal.I have a set of the newly revised fullscore.I have read the score, and I find that Rattle has done a lot which not in the score.for example, he add a lot cresc. and dim. in some notes. and the music is full of such as ""sp. cresc"", I think it misunderstood Beethoven's original meaning.Another example is in the final of 9th Symphony. at bar 747, Del Mal think hear is staccato, but it is just for the strings, not for the choral, so at bar 748 ""Brueder"" can't be sung in staccato.yes, maybe Rattle want to have a new try of Beethoven.He may be have new thoughts of Beethoven, but i think what he thinks is quite a mistake."
1,Review,"Worst purchase ever, the M-Audio Gforce Oddity Arp Odyssey Modeled Synth incuded no Product manual, no synth, just a crap disk that i cant install on my PC, major rip off"
5,Inspires me to learn more of God's Word,"I've had this book for 3 years and it never gets old. Each time I read through the devotions, Joyce seems to have a way of making me want to learn more of God's Truths and put them into action in my life. This is a fantastic devotional that makes me dig deep into myself and pull out what's underneath the surface."
5,"Eye Opener, So True!",This book will open your understanding of our everyday battle! It is an eye opener and a help to our daily Bible Study! It has been taken off my hands by my friends!
2,This needs focus and structure.,"I've listened to several of Mr. Emery's hypnosis tracks and quite liked them. I had high hopes for this video; however, I was quite disappointed.I found it painful to sit through this dvd. The pace is very slow, there is too much jargon, and too much talking. NLP people are always talking about modeling succesful strategies. Why then, can't they put together a tightly structured step by step protocol that can be easily understood by the layman, learned, and efficiently run through?This really needs to be a dvd with menus, a concise run through of the protocol, a separate section with theoretical explanations, and a pdf giving a concise step by step run through of the change protocol.I have watched this and am working on applying the protocol. I took notes as I watched but I will probably need to watch this again to more clearly understand the process. I am not looking forward to watching again."
5,RECIPES FROM CORSICA,"RECEIVED THIS BOOK IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER-IN EXCELLENT CONDITION...SO FAR, AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE VENDORS YOU HAVE CHOSEN FOR US.RAY DEVONELONDONDERRY NH"
5,Very good,I ordered this cover so when I travel I have to put my curling iron in when it is hot. This cover works great. I use at home so my children dont accidentaly lift it and get burned. I use this all the time. If you need one this is a great cover.
3,"Well made, but the back pocket is not big enough for my cord","This has been a great addition to my travel routine: place hot iron into bag, as designed. My flat iron must have a very long cord (6 feet?), and when bundled neatly, it does not fit entirely into the cord pocket. The design of this pouch is slightly flawed -- the cord pocket is only half the length of the bag! If the pocket were the full length, everything would fit.You can't see the cord pocket in any of these photos -- it's on the reverse side of the bag. The bag is otherwise very functional and very long, could hold a full length curling iron very easily. Color is true to photo. I just wish the dang kangaroo pocket for the cord were bigger!"
5,Love this item!,I use this to hold my flat iron and it works great! I can put it away hot and not have to worry. I purchased this to take on a trip and it worked great. I'd purchase this again.
4,Keeps the hot iron away from little hands,I do like this bag and it definitely servers it's purpose but I find myself just wrapping the chord around the bag instead of using the chord pocket on the back as it is too small to fit the chord unless I spend a lot of time folding it up tightly. As a time saver I just wrap the chord around it but the main reason I bought it was just to keep the iron away from my curious child. If they made the chord pocket the full length of the bag I would use it and give this 5 stars. Still a good product though.
4,Does the job,"My poor husband was tired of waiting for the flat iron to cool before packing it away, so he bought me one for my birthday. It works great, my only wish is that the pouch on the back was larger to accommodate the long cord and large plug on my flat iron."
3,Three Men and a Maid,This book was light read. It is the type book that has lots of action going on. Reminds me of many English types of books I have read in the past. Fun reading.
3,"Helpful, informative, but a little lacking...","I bought this book from Fodor's because I really needed information on Southern CA in addition to the parks. I basically got overall general information regarding the parks/restaurants and small tidbits about some of the close by attractions. I guess I am used to reading ""the Unofficial Guide"" products which will just spell it out for you the good, the bad and the ugly.... Some of the info in this book could've been taken straight from a Disney brochure."
4,Revenge Gifts what a good idea,I just finished this book and really enjoyed it a lot. The characters are well drawn and the story is just a hoot. Have fun.
2,Very disappointed,"If I can't get through the first 50 pages of a book, I don't bother with it. This book I couldnt get through twenty! I love any type of paranormal story, but this one was just BORING!The characters were two dimensional and I really didnt care for the heroine."
5,AWESOME & FUN!,"I got this book for free one day, I started reading it two days later. I LOVED it. Could not put it down. I am ready for the next book in the series. I plan to get it as soon as it comes out in December. Great book, really awesome characters. I read a lot, and therefore can get very critical. The worst part of this book was that I finished it entirely too fast!!"
1,NOT Compatible with all phones,"This product is not well suited for my LG Vue, I am still looking for a better armband."
2,"Nice Look, Poor Intonation","This was the first Uke I bought shopping on line and it is a beauty. Really wonderful size and the rounded back is a pleasure to hold. Very solid and lovley construction. The problems are in the tone, action and intonation. The tone is rather flat, the action if difficult and troublesome especially once you get above the fifth fret. The intonation starts to fail above the fifth fret as well. I play a Martin Guitar so these drawbacks were painful. I have recently bought a Kala Uke and really it is much, much better for the same or even less money. Look to Kala!!"
4,GREAT UKE for the Bucks,"The quality of this UKE is as good as any Applause guitar, which for the money is very good. The build quality is excellent, and once the strings are worn in, they hold their tune much better than any cheap UKE. If you enjoy the UKE, it's well worth the price for this model. The tonal quality is crisp and clear, but not quite the warm sound one hears from a wooden UKE. Now, if only my fingers could play it better..."
2,of historical interest only,"i have come across this dvd before in a martial arts webstore. unfortunately there have been no reviews on the product to help me decide whether to purchase it or not. after going through the dvd in a little less than an hour, the only high point of this grainy, black and white dvd is the opportunity to see gichin funakoshi, as well as masatoshi nakayama and other senior karate senseis go through various techniques briefly. it was clearly intended to explain karate to those who do not know what karate is, and not to those who are interested in further instruction. sensei nakayama's dynamic karate, or master funakoshi's karatedo kyohan would be a much more useeful investment. if you already have both and a member of a good dojo, you can pass on this one."
4,Sheavy - 'Electric Sheep' (Music Cartel),"I really like these bands,like Sheavy that make an all out effort to recapture the '70's hard rock scene with a psychedelic tone to it.Don't you?If not,stop here and go read some lame-ass review of some worthless release.With vocalist Steve Hennessey being like a Ozzy wanna-be,is probably why Sheavy remains a cult band.I've heard a couple of fellow stoner rock fans comment that this CD is like Sheavy musically breeding the 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' lp with Zeppelin's 4th album.I mean,how cool is that?With tracks like ""Virtual Machine"" and ""Stardust"" kicking some serious ass like they do,Sheavy lets their fans know what's vital to their music.Will appeal to fans of Spirit Caravan,Sleep,Orange Goblin and Atomic Bitchwax."
2,Samsung YP-N30S-64,"In trying to research info on this model, the manual said it was upgradeable but I don't think that means the memory. Looks like it might take an SD card in the battery compartment but the manual says nothing about upgrading the memory, just the functions. (something to do with CODEX upgrades) that you can download free from their website: samsungyepp.com. Was considering buying one off ebay but 64mb just isn't worth the money if it only holds about 20 songs max."
5,Smegging hilarious,"I got turned on to this show when our local PBS station started showing it, & I've been hooked ever since. This tape of out-takes is great, & can be watched multiple times without getting old. If you're a fan of the show, you'll enjoy this tape. Also check out the second tape, ""Smeg Outs""."
2,Better dead than shred ?,"only first 5 tracks show DD at his stormy best, the others are acoustic, very relaxed, very average and very boring numbers which seem to be played ""live"", maybe great fun and easily earned money for DD, but great disappointment and lost money for those who like his unique original music, not this unavailing ""disorientation"" (clips from this CD here are totally misleading)."
4,Great Product,"I use the entire line of Murad products and this Age Diffusing Serum works very well. My skin is soft, tight and well moisturized. If purchased in fine beauty stores, it costs considerably more. Very pleased with the product and will always be a Murad user."
2,jury is still out,"Been using this product every eve on only one side of my face to see if there really would be difference. I'm extremely sad to report that on my skin (I have olive complexion) I am actually seeing fine wrinkle lines along my cheek area. Did not have this before and don't have this on the opposite side. I'll continue, just in case this is temporary. I'll keep you posted.Murad Resurgence Age-Diffusing Serum, 2: Treat/Repair, 1.0 fl oz (30 ml)"
4,stunning!!,"The crystals are beautiful. I purchased it about two months ago but haven't worn it yet, because it does not fit my wrist. I wish there was an easier way to shorten it."
5,The Best Point & Figure Text Ever Written,"At this writing in 2011 I'm a senior citizen and I've been studying investing since 1982. I came across my first point & figure (P&F) material about 1986. Since then I've read every P&F book or article I could get my hands on and I've got to say that this book is the most comprehensive P&F book I've ever encountered. From start to finish, it is loaded with everything --and I mean everything! -- you could use on P&F. It even includes other technical analysis indicators that can be integrated into P&F work. I only wish this was the first book I read on the subject. Yes, it's an expensive book, but it's worth every penny to the serious investor."
3,Not for the kindle!,The graphics are important in this book and it is not possible to really see the charts even with the zoom feature on the Fire.
1,devoid of imagination,"I read most of it then sold it off for $75.00 a few weeks ago. Reading this book was like reading a history book on the point and figure methodology. After the author established the correct form or type of P&F; you should be using, he simply attaches some semi modern indicators to this methodology such as bollinger bands, moving averages etc.There is so much more he could have done in what will probably be his only published work for the trading community to enjoy. Instead of attaching those indicators I wished he would have gone further into specific nuances of this methodology which had not been previously mentioned. Just my opinion!Note: I have just purchased the 2nd edition of this book which has been updated corrected and added to by an increase of 20%(from 450 to 540 pages). Hopefully this will have more of what I am looking for. Will let you know."
3,Definitely not for beginners!,"I am fairly conversant in technical analysis and was looking to expand my horizons into P & F. This book, may be suitable for investors familiar with the essentials, but it is definitely not a good reference for utter beginners!"
1,Hogwash,"The first word defined in this dictionary should be oxymoron with ""Christian Student"" as an example. Evolution is not imaginary; Christ is."
3,Not for big dogs....,"I bought these when the brand I was initially looking for wasn't available. It seems to be a fine product in general, my dogs didn't object to the taste and they don't smell overpoweringly refreshing. However I have two Newfoundlands, a giant breed dog, with giant mouths and teeth and these wipes are more appropriate for like a Teacup Yorkshire Terrier. They are so small (like the stridex face wipes we used as teens) that when I try and wipe their teeth down, they nearly swallow the wipes altogether and are quite difficult to hold on to. I would not recommend these dental wipes to any dog owner except the owner of a toy breed."
2,My dog will not tolerate these,"I had high hopes for these wipes vs. a toothbrush for my dog. She hates them, however, and because the wipes are so small, they practically go down her throat while she's fighting to get away from me. I'm going to try these on my larger more calm greyhound, but the little one would prefer toothbrush and coconut oil over these."
4,Good basic guide,"More indepth information about the artistic development of the style than others. Good basic data about how to begin designing your own patterns. One of two essential books, I would think, for any seriouos knitter who is interested in learning these techniques.Well written, easy to read."
4,"Palm Handheld,Fifth Edition",In general the book is well organized and lucid. It is easy to read and useful. The only drawback I found was that the Palm T/X is not covered.
5,Delicious for the popcorn and candy lover in you...,"Wow, this is good stuff. I love popcorn, and getting delicious sweet toffee with it is definitely tasty! And this gives me a supply that will last a while too."
4,Solid Buffy,"One of the stronger entries in the book series, and the most adult. The characters are more believably drawn than usual, true to their T.V. personaes but with an added dimension not often found in the books.This one reads almost like a murder mystery or detective novel, and has less slam-bang action than usual. Suspense is maintained, red herrings are offered, and the action is refreshingly economical (and more effective for it). The ending is satisfying, but has a slightly rushed quality to it.My only regret about this author is that he hasn't penned more Buffy books. This is an auspicious debut. Resurrecting Ravana is a good entry to interest the newbies, and will certainly satisfy the fans."
4,Resurrecting Ravana,this is an excellent book with Buffy and Willow almost fighting to the death and the rakshasa it was thrilling and a great adventure.
2,OK story but characterization off,"This was an interesting story, and I always enjoy the inclusion of Ethan Rayne, but as with some of the other more recent books in this line, this author was really off the mark on the characters. Buffy lacked fire, Giles often came across as childish, and Angel was - very simply - an afterthought. This book was probably better than Obsidian Fate, but aside from that the weakest in the series (to date)."
2,"good concept, poor programmatics","While the Lemony Snicket books are fantastic, this game's programming flaws make it only fair. The great concepts are still there--character perspective swaps, gadgets that Violet makes, etc--but the play requires a high level of manual control that's not supported by this game's sloppy programming. This makes play frustrating. Another oddity is the inability to save at will; users are forced to play to a certain point before saving. If this is a bug, the patch isn't out for it yet. Overall, this is a disappointment."
3,Poor production values,"I haven't read this book. I own it, but I haven't read it. The reason I haven't read it is because they chose an unfortunate font for the text of the book, a font that's too ""dense"" on the page. I kid you not. I admit it's a strange criticism but if reading a book is an exercise in eye strain, that's a problem. The only time it lets up is on the one page where the font inexplicably changes. And what's with the photo on the page three title page? That's an American Staffordshire Terrier, not an SBT. It has cropped ears, and its legs and neck are long. I gave it three stars because I didn't think it was fair to completely pan a book I haven't read, and the photos that are actually of SBTs are adorable"
4,A very sweet sexy romantic book,"Although not made of the flaming graphic love scenes we are now use to in many of our current contempory novels, this story is still very sensual and sexy. The hero Oregon Brown is sweet, sexy, hunky and has a voice that can melt butter. I loved every moment in reading the budding romance between Charity and Oregon. Charity was only suppose to be in Oklahoma temporarily to take care of some family business and a recently widowed aunt that raised her when she was young. Everything started changing when during the day she met the wealthy, cocky and hunky neighbor Oregon Brown. He pushed all the wrong buttons with her as well as the right ones. Then of course there were the nights with the sexy sultry voice of the nighttime disc jockey, Rory Runyon, that she also couldn't help but fall in love with. With the both of them making her body ache and her heart throb, who do you chose?? Choices, choices, What fun! I loved this book."
5,Trouble Don't Last,"I think this book is phenomenal because I felt like I was right there with Samuel, on the long and treacherous road to freedom. It made me feel very lucky to be free when I read all of the hardships the main character and his friend, Harrison, went through. If topics like the Underground Railroad interest you, then this is the fast-paced, heart-pounding book for you!"
5,LOVE IT!!,"This is a great tool in the kitchen. You pull the little knob at the end and it locks in place with ease. I've even used it on the grill, though I'm not sure if you are supposed to. : )"
1,does it mean other 8 books I read with same information,"does not cover how to make money ??.Same, same same information in all her 20+ books. she is running out of ideas to make money , I guess !!"
2,Pale green looking,"When I received it and soon after opened it, the matcha appears a pale green, as if it has been sitting in storage too long before they sent it. DoMatcha, on the other hand, when I first bought it was bright green and fresher.Not into this brand -- I prefer DoMatcha. . ."
5,Green Tea has NO caffeine,"but the previous reviewer doesn't know that with his ""jittery"" comments. He loves looking at what he writes on products he knows nothing about and doesn't even try. Never helpful but allways full of himself, and all that for your pleasure! All for the price of nothing.... and thats what its worth."
3,Orderedr to fit an ironing board I had.,No opinion on this cover as I haven't had a chance to use it yet. Waiting to buy another ironing board.
5,a tv series worth watching!,"Let's face it. We all have our favourite programs to watch, whether it is an hbo tv series, the news, the comedy channel, or a nice BBC program for us to view here in america. Ballykissangel just happens to be the one of the best bbc programs I have ever seen. I just hope they keep putting more of them on video to enjoy as our local stations don't show them in a steady stream. ballykissagel vol. 1 (trying to connect you and the things we do for love) video are worth buying! I give it 5 stars! I also recommend vol.2 (live in my heart and pay no rent, fallen angel) and vol. 3, (the power of glory, and missing you already)"
2,Pecta Sol Modified Citrus Pectin Powder,"I have used this product from Source Naturals for over a year and have always felt satisfied. It is very important that the produce be created by Pecta Sol and the produce that I received did not say Pecta Sol Midified Citrus Pectin it said PECTMMUNE MODIFIED CITRUS PECTIN. I have Prostate cancer and I need to know for certain that the produce that I received is the one by Pecta Sol.So, that labeling leaves me with questions????? Hopefully someone has the answers."
3,Great game to watch but video quality is so/so,"The game is in it's entirety without commercials. There is no pre or post-game stuff though. The video quality is so/so, but you probably won't find better since over 20 years ago!Commentary is from the broadcasters and is good."
1,poor package,The poster has arrived damaged. The pack was inapropriated to kind of product. I sugest a solid and strong paper tube to send
5,"""10"" by Brian McKnight","This CD is the best from Brian McKnight so far. The song ""Used to be my girl"" is just awesome--the rhythm, tempo, and McKnight's singing...Wow."
2,What happened to Brian McKnight?,"What happened to B. McKnight? This album is just lousy compared to his other works. I am a fan of his music but this album dissapointed me. Its noticeable that he strayed away from his usual style and opted for imitating the style of other performers. The songwriting is just bad, melodies are bad, voice not the best, and it looks he just wanted to get this album out quick without putting much effort into the songs. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of his music, and U-turn was excellent, but this one frankly dissapointed me. In my humble opinion, most definitely NOT his best work!"
5,Great Product Great Price,"I have tried several maple sugar products in the past, and this is by far the best value. Not only does it have wonderful flavor, but it is the least expensive I have found, especially when you subscribe and save!"
5,BUY IT!!,"I ordered this for my daughter, who has long, very thick hair. After trying many different kinds of brushes and having only moderate success, I decided to take a chance on this one based on reviews. WHAT A BUY!!! She no longer complains when I brush her hair either wet or dry, and after a year it's still going strong! Don't look any further, this is the brush for anyone whose hair tends to knot and tangle!"
5,the best freaKin brush ever.,"I have REALLY long thick hair. This brush does the trick. It is my out of the shower brush as it doesn't get caught up in my wet hair and cause more tangles. I was shocked at how well it brushes through all my hair even when it is dry and it doesn't make my hair frizzy or full of static. My 6 year old niece loves this brush as it doesn't hurt to brush her hair. If you have a kid who doesn't like to brush their hair because ""it hurts"" this is the brush for you."
1,"First two were great, third smelled awful","I have ordered two of these brushes in the past and both were fantastic, but the third that I just ordered smelled like someone smoked a pack of cigarettes over it. I can't believe how horrible it smells and it is currently sitting in its original wrapping in the box unusable. If yours comes wrapped in a plastic bag check the smell inside of it before gifting it to anyone!"
3,Not a miracle detangler....,"It's an alright brush, no doubt, but I am not bewildered by it's detangling power.To read the reviews, you'd think it was nearly magical!It is one of the better brushes I have owned, espeically for the great price, and it does help with tangles, but not enough for me to give it more than 3 stars for this purpose.But if you're looking for a good brush that is better than most you'll pay for at this price, this is it!"
1,Why is this brush so highly rated?,"I took a risk blowing $7 bucks in hopes this brush was a miracle. Guess what, it's not. If you have fine, long hair it will snag and tear at it. You're better off getting a Goody ""No Tears"" brush if you're looking for something that won't tear and still get out the tangles. I have hair past my bottom, very fine but thick and this just isn't what is being advertised in these reviews. Gotta wonder if every employee of the brush manufacturer got on here proclaiming this brush some ""miracle"". It's not, and a $5 buck Goody brush is much better.Boy, truly tired of hyped out reviews which are questionable convincing me to spend my hard earned dough only to get another ""not as advertised"" useless product."
3,An OK Brush,"I read the glowing reviews and thought this was the brush that was going to work perfectly on my thick, wavy, midlength hair.It is meh...ok. The bristles are very thin and not strong. I imagine that they will break soon. It does seem to de-tangle hair quite well without ripping the hair.The fabric where the bristles come out of gets wet in the shower, and takes a long time to dry out - not what I would think would be a good thing for a brush claiming to be a good wet brush.There are a series of brushes that are all the same brush here on Amazon - I purchased several at the same time, and they are identical except for the branding."
5,Really Works!,This brush is great. I have twin 8 year old girls who love to swim. Things have been much easier after swimming with the brush. The only thing is you can pick what color you want.
4,Really cool looking and delivers,"I got this because of it's popularity and reviews of other buyers - and am not disappointed - the qualify and affordability of this is better than anything we can get locally, and we do live in a metro area of 1 million plus."
5,Amazing brush!,"Not only do I love this brush, but I purchased 4 more to give as gifts to my friends and family. Great job on making something amazing for women who have hair that is difficult to brush when wet or dry. ++++"
5,Awesome!,"I have A LOT of thick hair, but I got this comb after I got it cut and thinned out a lot, so my hair is easier to brush with anything. However, this brush works a lot better than a comb (which was the only thing I could use on my wet hair before I cut it). It's got a nice grip and feels nice."
5,Hew,"I love the ""Wet Brush""!!! I have long hair and it always gets knotty when it is wet, this really helps to brush my hair without breaking it."
3,Nice but wore out quickly,"I used this brush over the past year, and while I loved it, the little rubber ends came off the bristles so I had to throw it out. For $7 I don't mind replacing it annually but at $20 or more in a salon there is no way I would buy it again. I have thick, long hair and it is much nicer to use than a traditional brush but a wide tooth comb works great too."
5,This Works!,"I love this brush. I have very long (past the middle of my back) fine textured bleach blonde hair. It used to be that even if I brushed my hair before I washed it and used plenty of conditioner, clumps of hair would come out in my brush when I brushed it wet. With the Wet Brush, it just goes right through. I have no idea how it works, but it does! And it doesn't hurt or rip out my hair at all. I wish I had this thing when I was little. But it definitely has prevented breakage for me, and my hair looks a lot better and healthier because of that. It doesn't work when your hair is dry, though. I think it's worth having two brushes, though, if one of them is this."
3,Great for about a month..,"This brush blew me away when I first got it. After a month or so, I noticed that the bristles were coming out. They get bent over and just break off easily. It doesn't work nearly as good with missing bristles. I'm kinda disappointed."
4,Does what it advertises,"I like my brushes...they do what they say they will do, which is prevent pulling of hair while it gently detangles. However, the bristles don't seem stiff enough and, although there is no pulling, it takes me several passes to detangle each area of hair."
2,Good writing; too filled with atrocities for me,"I read the first two books in the trilogy; will not read the third. After awhile it palls to read a never-ending series of rapes, murders, and wholesale slaughters, including children thrown onto swordpoints or gang-raped to death in front of their parents. To be fair to the writer, I suspect he is using real-life descriptions from the crusades -- but in the end it was simply too sickening to me. Also: Every major character but one or possibly two (Achamian, maybe Esmenet) is a monster of one sort or another. In particular, the Prince-of-Nothing title character is technically human, but he is as vicious, manipulative, and alien as the ""Consult"" portrayed as the hidden enemy of humanity."
3,It was okay.,"I really wanted to like this book. I didn't dislike it, but it never got to me. It had a tendency to meander aimlessly, which covered up the overall nice plot. Maybe this book will rate higher after the second book comes out and fills in the gaps, but for right now, 3 stars is max.Bakker tries to be George Martin in terms of setting up political intrigue---he fails at that, but the one thing he did succeed was creating the Emperor and the Emperor's mother and nephew--priceless characters."
4,Imaginative read,"A very imaginative and in depth fantasy. I couldn't put it down! The characters were very human, with good qualities, and demons alike. Looking forward to the rest of the series."
5,Fantasy for the Thinking Man,"The Darkness That Comes Before is a bold, unrelenting work that immediately takes hold of the reader and doesn't let go, even after it has been completely read. A masterful first book for Mr. Bakker, who has established himself as one of the best writers of the fantasy genre."
1,Boring,"Too many made up words that are as one other reviewer pointed out as being ""unpronouncable, even in your head"". I really wanted to like the book, since I have been desperately searching for something semi-decent to read until George R. R. Martin's new book arrives. I just couldn't get into it."
1,A jumbly boring mess of a book...,"This is a terrible book. I can't believe it was even published. Disjointed, jumbled and boring are three words that best describe it. Based on the poor writing, I intend to avoid other books from the publisher, Overlook Press, as it seems they are aptly named. As a tip to aspiring writers I would suggest that if you feel your novel warrants 3 appendix pages on varying dialects unique to your characters, you may want to drop fiction and, instead, write a linguistics dissertation."
2,Keep the Waranty Info,"This watch rates 2 stars (as oppose to one) because the quality of the band is excellent and of a high quality leather. Thhe face of the watch is actually smaler than it looks in the picture. However, I purchased 2 of these watches and they both arrived with dead batteries. The company sent a replacement and that battery died after 2 days!!!"
3,Not an ideal carrying case,"Decent material and well constructed, this bag goes well with the Sunpak 9002DX tripod. The bag opens from the top (the width near the letter ""S"" and not the length in the picture) and closes by a zipper. Inserting the tripod into the bag from the top is not so convenient as putting it in from the side of the bag. The fabric has a rubber like coating on the inside and is probably rain resistant. There is a short strap to tie the neck of the bag.My complaint is that the carrying strap is too short to carry the bag on the shoulder and too long to carry the bag like a briefcase. The strap, opposite the red Sunpak logo, is not adjustable in length and is stitched directly onto the bag. Also, I wish there were a small pocket to stuff the accessories such as a second quick-release pan head platform.Overall it is a good storage bag for the tripod, but not ideal as a carrying case."
3,Free Bag,"This bag came with the tripod, not overly impressive, after all it was free, and its only the bag."
3,The sudoku book,"The book is too small. It is convenient to carry in your purse, but I prefer puzzles that are about 8"" tall so there is room to sketch in numbers."
5,Should be banned,"I don't normally do puzzles so I asked a friend which sudoku book to buy, and he recommended this Griffiths-Jones book. It was a good choice, it's well put together. I got stuck a few times, but the tips at the beginning of the book helped. But be warned, these things are dangerous to productivity. I'd get going on one puzzle, look up, and 30 minutes had gone by just like that!"
4,DRYBRUSH WATERCOLOR,I just received this little book from Amazon and love the detailed illustrations by Gene Franks. The drawings and watercolor is so very nice that I also got one for a friend in my watercolor class. This is a reference book I will keep available on my shelf for years to come. At Amazon the price is always right and the shipping is fast.Watercolor: Drybrush Technique (Artist's Library Series)
3,Difficult to say,"I've been taking this supplements for a few weeks now and I think that is is beneficial. It's hard to say, though, since I've started using a new face lotion. I've been told that my skin looks (more) glowing and healthier (very atypical for me to hear during winter months!). So it's either the supplement or my new products (Mark oil-free moisturizer during the day). I think that my 'healthy glow' is coming more from my lotion than my supplement - which is why I only rated it a 3. For the price, I'd rather get two lotions than one bottle of vitamins. I'll probably continue taking them on occasion, however, because *any* added benefit to my skin from environmental damages is a positive and there aren't any harmful additives to the pills."
5,Lots of English Humor,I have this dvd and gave a copy to a dear friend for Chistmas. He told me it has given him much pleasure as it did me. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a barrel of laughs. So typically English.
4,Tailgate cable,This product was an exact fit for my vehicle. The quality seems equal to the original part. However one of the washers was missing but I was able to reuse an old washer.
3,Better for those who are newer to the genre,"I had heard good things about Cheryl Richardson, so I was excited to read this book. However, I found it somewhat light on content. The author clearly cares deeply about helping her readers, and she couches the advise/methods in very easy to swallow steps. But, for readers who are familiar with personal development resources, this seems like a general introduction. Therefore, I don't recommend it for people who consider themselves well read in the personal development genre. For those who are just getting their feet wet, are nervous about making changes, are interested in learning a new perspective about personal development, or who really like to follow a weekly schedule of recommendations, I think this book would be quite useful. Also, I do think that Cheryl Richardson is a highly competent and caring expert in the area."
1,How selfish can we be?,"I found this book extremely irritating. The author's premise seems to be that a major problem in American society is that none of us is focused enough on our own needs. Please! If our culture becomes any more self-centered, we will each sit in a quiet cubicle and do nothing but examine our bellybuttons.Save your money."
4,The Pothunters - Wodehouse's First Novel,"There is a glowing review appended as an afterword to the story in this novel about schoolboy adventures in England. That review would be 5 stars, and I would probably agree, except I want to save 5 stars for later Wodehouse works such as Luck of the Bodkins. I discovered Wodehouse because Douglas Adams praises him in his final book, The Salmon of Doubt. I love Wodehouse and think of him as an older, even more English version of Adams. In Pothunters, some trophies are stolen from a boarding school, and the adventures of the boys involved are intricate, extremely well written, and quite entertaining. Wodehouse peppers his prose with extremely clever phrasing, which causes me to laugh out loud. In the Pothunters I only laughed once per chapter. In Luck of the Bodkins it was every other page. Still, this book is worth the reading!"
2,Glossy fun for five minutes,This book is not for the serious sewer or for anyone requiring more than a couple of inspiring ideas. This book was as fun as picking up a glossy magazine for a few minutes. It does help you think outside the proverbial box.
3,He just doen't play with this toy,"My grandson (9 month old now) uses this toy to turn upside down and stand on, in his play pen. He never really played with it, no matter how much I did and tried to get him to watch and play. I think the sounds are fine and each section or animal, has something different to do and learn. He just doesn't seem to be interested. I have a lot of V Tech toys and this is one of his least favorite. I think it would depend on the type of toys your baby likes. The toy is rugged enough. It takes some doing to get the cat and dog sounds to work (you have to side a door from right to left for each and it's a little hard, even for me), and the pop up... what ever it is, has to be pushed down before it will pop up again, which I try to show him. The bird is the only part that is easy to play with, just pull the flower and the bird sings."
3,Still a feel-good movie,"Granted it's no ""Angels in the Outfield"", this sequel still has alot to offer. Based loosely upon same premise, here we have a young boy with a wish to have the family he once had prior to his father's death, he suddenly finds himself, with the help of angels, turning a losing high school football team into winners. There are a few humorous moments and some very touching scenes which show how strength, courage, and teamwork can heal. Even though I've seen it a number of times, I always get choked up at the end. Our society needs more ""feel-good"" movies like this!"
2,Disappointed,"Handle on salt shaker fell off almost immediately. We were able to fix this by taping the inside of the shaker so salt wouldn't come out of the handle holes, however, after approx. one month of use, I was unable to unscrew the salt shaker any longer. I ended up denting the contained in my effort to open it. Will not buy again. However, the pepper shaker is still working great after 9 months!!"
4,cute,these were a gift and seemed to meet the recipient's expectations. She was pleased so that's what counts. they are cute.
3,Oops!,"Beware, the salt holes are just as large as the pepper! Maybe other people purchase these to put on a shelf but I ordered me to actually use. I haven't had issues but I have to warn people if they are using the salt!"
5,Very Cute and Sturdy,I am not understanding the bad reviews...their salt and pepper shakers for $7. Cant expect to much out of them. We have a kitchen in our pole barn and we're decorating everything old school and these work perfect. Saw some people thought they were small. I felt they were larger than an average set and larger than what I have in my home. Cant imagine why'd you need them any bigger. I felt they were very sturdy and seemed to be very durable. Happy with my purchase!
2,would not recommed,I did not care for these. They look really cheap and look mass produced instead of vintage. Probably made in China but no info printed on box or on product.
3,decoration,My wife just HAD to have this thing. All I can say is it looks okay sitting in the corner. She used it once and didnt seem happy with it. Now its something else she doesnt dust.
5,GREAT DEAL!,"I had this sewing machine for the last two months, I'm just learning how to sew and it's been very easy to use, I'm still learning how to use all the stitches but I have already made a pair of pajamas and a nightgown. So I am very pleased with my purchase! This is his wife writing."
4,Excellent choice,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the product was delievered by UPS. Other than that the owner's guide is easy to understand.
4,"Aside from the bobbin looping ""problem"", it's a GREAT BUY!!","I would definitely recommend this sewing machine for the ""new to sewing"" or beginner (I am new to it as of 2 days ago). It is a simple machine that is not at all intimidating. I only gave it 4 stars because the manual is SO confusing. Little details that you may miss are not highlighted clearly enough. I had to rely on YouTube for help on filling the bobbin, threading and picking up the bobbin thread, before I could go on to my first project. The Amazon reviewer ""SBP"" (the top most helpful review) was also a life-saver, since I did end up having a bobbin looping ""problem"". Even after watching the awesome tutorials from YouTuber ""hbnole"". I am now sewing perfectly with no other problems. First timers...BUY this machine! You won't regret it!"
5,Great for beginners.,"If you are having problems getting things set up, try YouTube. There you can see the unboxing of this machine and a video tutorial on getting it set up. The machine works well."
5,Great for beginners,I had never used a sewing machine in my life but always wanted one and i got this one for Christmas and i absolutely love it. It was so easy to get started with just a little help from the user manual.
2,Loops in straight stitch,"I bought this machine based on its excellent reviews.. but I'm always getting loops on straight stitch. I followed threading instructions, width and length settings to the letter and I couldn't get a proper stitch. The thread coming from bobbin is very loose which is causing this issue."
2,Eh Ok,Had this machine for a couple years. Worked alright. Loved the button hole options. The problem I had was with the lower tension. All of the correct bobbin placement and cleaning couldn't fix it like so many reviewers. Took it to get repaired and after he messed with it awhile and took it apart and put it back together he told me the lower tension was completely off and it could be fixed but he wanted to charge me more than what I paid for it! I threw it away and bought a better machine without plastic parts.
5,Extremely happy!,"I had never used a sewing machine before purchasing this machine by Brother, and though I bought it for just minor repairs, not only is it paying for itself by my not having to replace things I ordinarily would have replaced such as my shirt that was coming apart around the collar I was able to make the repair and it is almost unnoticable, I just saved the price of the shirt because I ordinarily would have replaced it, this unit is also easy to use and works great, I recommend it for anyone that is looking to make minor repairs or to make outfits, I am very glad I bought it."
5,Great for beginner sewer,"I bought a $300 singer sewing machine before this and for a beginner sewer it was too high tech for me and broke within a year. This brother sewing machine is perfect for beginners because it's simple and effective. I don't do any fancy work but I have made curtains, cushions, art projects etc with this. I've also hemmed and fixed torn clothes eith this machine and I love it!"
2,Not worth your money,"I purchased this machine because I needed a sewing machine for my projects. They are simply clothing pieces, nothing involving heavy fabric like denim. When I first got this machine, it seemed to work perfectly. I needed to use a straight stitch and a zig-zag stitch for my first project. It worked fine for straight stitching, but then when I needed it to zig-zag stitch, changing the stitch dial would not work properly; I soon found out that the stitch dial would NOT work and would not change to any other stitch, and only straight-stitched despite the dial being on any other stitch setting. I looked in the product manual and thought I just needed to clean out the bobbin case... Nope. I took it in to my local sewing store and found out these types of machines were non-serviceable. That means you can't get it fixed... You can only return it. This happened only a WEEK after I started using it. So, once something's wrong -- it's useless. So I have to buy another machine now."
3,Good for simple jobs,"I have been using this machine for few months now. The positive thing with this one is very light weight and easy to use. The main issue is it cannot handle easily the thicker cloths like jeans etc. Since we cannot control or change the bobbin thread tension in this machine, sometime the stiching is not so great in the bottom side. Otherwise its good for very light use purpose."
3,Love the machine!,"Love this machine! Intuitive, easy, sews though a couple layers of denim; it has rejuvenated my interest in sewing. Love the bobbin set up and threaded, and comes with ample accessories. A bargain in quality, ease of use, and price!"
3,good,This is good for the price if you are a beginner. I would save up and get something a little better.
5,Awesome Machine,"This sewing machine will do anything you need it to do, and it's easy to use! Couldn't ask for a better deal with the big 50% off sale."
5,I LOVE IT!!!,I am very happy with this machine. It is perfect for a first time sewer. It is easy to figure out and operate
4,Easy to use for a Beginner,"I use to borrow my mom's machine for the rare times I had a need for a sewing machine - then I moved 400 miles away. I am strictly a novice when it comes to sewing, but wanted something that would be easy to use when I needed it. I had 11 curtain panels I wanted to make for a porch and this looked like it would do the job. It arrived very well packaged in the original manufacturers packaging. All of the needed parts were included to begin sewing. The directions are a little fuzzy - but I attribute that to my lack of knowledge about sewing in general. I knocked out the curtains in no time flat. There are a lot of things this machine can do if I, the operator, take the time to learn how to do them. All in all I am quite pleased with the machine and the quality and performance. Great price. Hope to try and broaden my horizons with a bit of knowledge and see what else I can manage. I would recommend without question."
3,Dimensions stated in description are incorrect,"This machine measures out at 14.5"" long x 12"" high x 6.75"" deep which is much wider and taller than stated in description. Super disappointed as I bought this machine in particular because of the dimensions being smaller than a full size machine.I wanted a small, light, portable machine to fit in tiny spaces and move around easily. It is light and easy to lift but it is much larger than stated.Otherwise it works okay for the price, an average machine. It has big oversized wheel for stitch selection and reverse button which is not very sleek looking."
2,meganlew1,"I guess you get what you pay for. The machine does not do well with heavier fabrics, such as denim as advertised.The machine is so light weight that it moves as fabric is moved. The stitching quality is NOT there."
4,a great club dancing CD,"I got the chance to dance/hear this one in a party, and it was dancable like hell ! Don't own it yet, bt it's on my up comming list. Dance baby, dance !"
4,Nice,"The heel smoother is nice for ongoing personal pedicure care/maintanence. I wouldn't say it is industrial strength, and wouldn't recommend it for those who have serious feet callous problems."
2,Good Idea....Poor Product.,"I bought this after I read the first review below (the one who gave this 5 stars). It just doesn't work very well...I do a better job pumicing on my own (it just takes more effort). The motor does get extremely hot, and the batteries die very quickly. The box says it can run for 45 minutes on two AA's, but after about 5 minutes...you can feel it slow down.Definitely not worth it. I'm calling today to return it."
1,Horrible,"As soon as I touch my foot with the smoother, it stops rotating. It did not work at all on the tough skin on my heels. It did work on some small calluses on the tops of my toes, but it took about 2 minutes to wear down the callus. The motor wore down the batteries fast and I did notice that the device felt hot after 10 minutes. Basically this device was horrible!"
2,Not Worth the Money,"I have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem. They aren't dragon feet, but they do have to be softened pretty often. I have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when I saw the Artemis Heel Smoother advertised, I decided I had to try it. It's a waste of money. The appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml. In fact, I have a Dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better. The Artemis appliance does NOT scrape any dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on. It comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma. I would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing. Save your money."
3,low resolution,"Used to play this game on a pc, and the image on the gamecube is really poor, the graphics are dark, and believe me, is not the tv. the game could be better"
2,A Disappointment,"I bought this video for my son, hoping that it would be an alternative to the Disney version--something truer to the A.A. Milne classic. It was very true to the original--it's just a man on camera reading the stories. While this would work quite well as an audio tape, it doesn't work at all as a video--there's just nothing to look at! The storyteller gives an animated reading, but it's not enough to save the video. I couldn't help but think it might have been a splendid tape if they'd just done it as a voice over while showing illustrations. Rabbit Ears Videos uses this technique. In fact, I wish Rabbit Ears would do a version of Winne The Pooh. Oh well, . . . ."
2,Disappointed,I was so excited to find this product on my front porch this afternoon. I unwrapped it quickly and started to assemble the stand. What a joke! Holes were not drilled where there should have been holes. The holes that did get drilled were not drilled all the way through. The knobs were stripped. Once I finally got it assembled I was too mad to even try using it.I had saved my money to purchase this item ($65 to me is a lot) and I now feel like it was a waste. I will never by a product from this company again.
2,not worth the hype,"I was expecting a good coherant yarn in this book, but instead it was series of yawns. It appears that Mr. Gilder put together his Forbes articles did some minor editing and passed off the book to his publishers. It is all the hype about how huge fat pipes are coming gushing with bits. It does not provide any deep insights into the technologies nor what applications will exploit such fat pipes.A potential reader is well advised to pass on this, or at least wait until his local library gets a copy."
3,Good technology primer -- BAD investment advice!,"If you want to know how today's technology came into being, and what the future holds for tomorrow's technology, this is an excellent book. As a non-techie, I understood Gilder's explanations and found the story of tech development fascinating.Unfortunately, I decided to invest in some of the companies he claims hold the most promise. Boy was I wrong! Anyone who bought JDS Uniphase, Nortel, or pretty much any other company Gilder praised in 2000 is hurting now.Buy Telecosm for the technology. Go somewhere else for investment advice."
5,Wonderful,This is NOT humor for the faint of heart!It is in your face humor - not silly stuff or slap stick.If you enjoy a quick wit - Black Adder is your man!
2,A Disappointment,"Other books that Mr. Hogan has written are much better. Although the plot is clever, this book contains endless exposition and is just too long."
1,Propaganda for the populus,"Hogan missed his calling in life. He should have directed propaganda films for the U.S. in the forties. All of the German characters are written to be the ultimate in evil while every American or individual aligned to the allies is written as a Christ-like figure. Hogan lives in a fantasy land of his own where the U.S. can do no wrong. His recreation of how Churchill, Roosevelt, and Einstein are portrayed is in direct conflict with several biographies out regarding these men. Hogan must have lost some relatives in Aushwitz and this book is his way of chest-thumping that the good old USA won the war. Anyone who has taken at least one history class in college regarding WWII can read this book and laugh to their hearts content. Only problem is he's trying to be serious."
4,The Daily Office,"The material itself is excellent. My only concern is that these materials are part of a multi-volume set and it was unclear which item I was purchasing. Without greater detail in the title/volume, I don't feel able to purchase more because of potential duplication of materials."
2,Gracefully Insane,"I just finished this book. It is a good read. Interesting info about some famous people who have been through McLean. However, I thought the book would be more about what happened in this type of environment, especially during the turn of the century. I think what would have made the book more of an enjoyable read. The parts regarding the doctors and people who ran the hospital was good."
3,Rich in Anecdotal History,"Beam's ""Gracefully Insane"" is rich in anecdotal history, but poor in other areas. Makes for a light, enjoyable read, but Beam rarely teases out the interesting insights that arise from his excellent access to the inner workings of America's ""Premier"" mental hospital.This book will make you think about the (troubled) history of psychiatry/ treatment of mental illness, and Beam's portrait of this institution caused me to shed no tears for the fall of this fabled refuge for blue blooded loons.Reading interviews with ""graduates"", its hard not to question the assumptions that underlied McLean's very reasons for existence. Few of the individuals profiled within seem like they were ever a ""danger to self or others"". Indeed, when a rash of suicides hit McLean a couple of decades ago, the staff were singularly unprepared to cope. Perhaps this is because the ""inmates"" were not as bad off as one might suppose?Makes an interesting companion piece for Goffman's ""Asylums""."
5,Christmas With the Trapp Family Singers,The item was exactly as discribed and arrived in good condition. I would gladly buy from this seller again...anytime!
4,This is a great addition even if you have the MegaSet!!,"I have the complete Thames Mega-set, and wasn't going to get this.. but for 10 bucks I figured.. why not.I love it!! YES.. many of the skits are done later on on Thames, but it is just really cool to see him so young, I mean 1958!!The quality is pretty good considering, they are better then the ""Lost Honeymooners"" and I am very happy I bought it.Jim"
2,Did I miss something?,"***Spoiler***Since others have mentioned the storyline all I can tell you is that I must have missed something. Yes, this could have been a five star book but the relationship between Dom and Honor was too bumpy. For two supposedly smart people their communication skills weren't the best. And the secondary stories between Honor and Bruno plus Dom and Rafe were tied up a little too neatly. I know, I know... it should have been just a light read but I enjoy a plot with a little more consistency.I got this book from the library so I didn't lose out on anything but I did buy book #2- Heaven's Hero- Nick's story, based on reviews here. I'll let you know how that goes."
4,good book to learn how to read at a little bit higher level,This book is good for children that are learning how to add and subtract. For example in the book the mom made 12 cookies and they had to spit them in half and then two more people came and then 4 more people came until every one only had gotten one cookie. Also this book teaches that it is important to share.
3,Great oldie but shows its age,"Don't get me wrong, this is the great game that started the whole real war FPS thing going around now (there's actually some for Vietnam, I know war is war but that just seems wierd to me).The only real reason to get this game though is if your computer is more than 3 years old and can't handle more excellent fare like Call of Duty. But the game has some great levels, the best being D-Day. The game does a good job showing the desperation of getting to the other side of that beach. But after playing a few different games, the graphics are pretty lame. And I found the you-vs.-Germany thing a little stupid. But for anyone who wants to enter the world of PC gaming with a less than current PC, you could do a lot worse."
2,Kindle Edition,The Kindle (I have DX in case that matters) edition missing the index altogether and the chapter numbers in the TOC.
1,Lame.,"I was looking for more information on Tibetan buddhism, but sadly this book is mostly about the author. I found it hopelessly narcissistic and pedantic. It went straight to the recycle box."
5,New to the Buddha world?,I highly recommend this book for those who do not know too much about Buddhism.
4,"A book that offers a clear pathway toward ""enlightenment"".","Surya Das has managed to translate his many years of intense study in the buddhist religion into clear and practical advice that can make a positive difference in one's life. In reading ""The Buddha within I feel as if I have received a gift from the author who has culled the from the treasures of his experiences and produced a gem of a book that will help any reader along the path to ""enlightenment""."
5,RAPE OF NANKING,"IN 1975 I WENT TO COLBY COLLEGE INM WATERVILLE MAINE.I HAD SEVERAL CHINESE FRIENDS DURING THIS TIME AND I WAS TOLD ABOUT ""THE RAPE OF NANKING""YEARS BEFORE THE BOOKK BY IRIS CHANG WAS WRITTEN.I WAS TOLD ABOUT HORRIFIC CRIMES BY THE JAPANESE AGAINST THE CHINESE.I HEARD ABOUT JAPANESE RAPING AND MURDERING INNOCNET CHINESE CIVILIANS.WHEN I READ IRIS CHANG'S BOOK ABOUT NANKING IT SOUNDED TOTALLY TRUE TO ME.BASICALLY MS.CHANG FLESHED OUT THE STORIES I HEARD IN 1975.THE JAPANESE CRIMES IN NANKING ARE TRULY BLOOD CURTLING AND HORRIFIC.THREE CHEERS TO MS.CHANG FOR EXPOSING THE TRUTH."
2,The Rape of Nanking,"This is really not a book. It's more of an oddly presented description, in general, of the terrible events in Nanking in late 1937/early 1938. It is a difficult read, there is no flow, and the narrative style is quite stilted. I would not recommend it."
4,Incredible story of one of the world's most unknown horrors.,"Iris Chang has done the world a great service by writing this, heretofore, forgotten history. Although mentioned in the history books, the full impact of the Japanese atrocities have remained unrecognized. How could a holocaust of such magnitude go under-reported? Modern society owes Ms. Chang a dept of gratitude for forcing this issue to the front. The even greater mystery is how Japan has not been forced to admit to, and apologize for, the unspeakable criminal acts committed by the Imperial Japanese Army during the period 1937-45. The US government, in conjunction with all of the world's law abiding nations, must demand Japan own up to, and apologize for, the war crimes committed in WW2. Why Japan has escaped rebuke would be an excellent topic for another book. An excellent book, heartbreaking in details. A must for students of this era."
1,Style over Substance,"Iris Chang seems to have set out to capture the Rape of Nanking in an objective fashion in her ""Rape of Nanking."" Instead we get an unbelievably flawed book. From facts and sources that are made up to doctored photographs, Chang plays with the reader's emotions. Don't be fooled, the Rape of Nanking was a terrible event, but to hear Chang tell it is to have it lose its importance amongst unrepresentative anecdotes and uncited details."
1,Interesting but excessive exaggeration,"The intent of this book is clear and compelling. The bottom line is, the Empire of Japan SHOULD HAVE ADMITTED what her did during WWII in China. However, this book critically lacks credibility of the facts. I have to regret many of the facts stated in the book are untrue or incorrect from the perspective of the fact-oriented international populace (e.g., the pictures of Chinese-self-acted Japanese solders, beheaded Chinese criminals executed by their own government, and the number of victims of 300,000 despite 10,000-30,000 revealed by the international investigation body right after the war). It was certainly a tragedy, but we need the FACTS to consider, not her emotional urban folklore. Iris Chang makes it a point to manipulate some facts to make effectively and systematically the entire plot plausible. Japanese government must apologize and Iris Chang must have written the book, both based exclusively on the HARD FACTS. Both are impostors!"
4,a middle ground opinion,"Based on other reviews, it seems that most readers are strongly for or strongly against Chang's portrayal of the Japanese occupation of Nanking. I would like to offer the opinion that both views are right and both views are wrong. There is some anti-Japanese bias, but that should be expected from any writer describing a tragedy involving family members. Chang's description, however, is valid as references are cited and (graphic) pictures are provided.Readers wishing another viewpoint should consider The Good Man from Nanking"
5,"Long before I read ""The Rape of Nanking""","I am a Korean from South Korea. While I was a high school student back in early 1980s, I was taught about Nanking Massacre by my history teacher.Japan has never apologized about this.Japanese Prime Minister and his high officials pay respect to the War Criminals as their patriots.The world should know and understand why Korea and China worries about Japanese re-militarization and re-armament."
1,GHQ still alive,"The interesting thing with Truth Sayer's review is the blamings made here are quite similar to GHQ's propaganda when Japan had been under its despotism.I think seeing the GHQ propaganada and censoring is a good start for Japaneses and Americans to release ourselves from the fallacy. ""Nanking Massacre"" had been a part of GHQ's propaganda program.I recommend Hosaka Masayasu's ""Nihon Kaitai"" (Breaking up Japan) to know about the GHQ propaganda and Etou Jun's ""Tozasareta Gengo Kuukan"" (Closed Language Space) for pursuing the censorship. Kai Yuzuru's ""GHQ Censor"" is a must read for all Japaneses, which is a first hand testimony written by the former censor who had been working in GHQ."
2,"Historically accurate, but needs to go further.","While the atrocity of the Japanese in Nanking is comprehensively reported, it is disappointing that Iris Chang does so little to connect this with China's current rape of Tibet. How can the readers of this book NOT be infuriated with China for its treatment of the Tibetan people? How can people ignore CURRENT atrocities, in favor of rehashing the past? While Chang does a good job of illuminating the events in Nanking, it is disappointing that she does so little to illuminate the present. The Chinese are, if anything, worse than the Japanese--they are committing systematic genocide on a scale comparable to Hitler. The Chang disappoints because she, along with the US, Europe, and the rest of the world, coveniently looks the other way."
2,Interesting but extremely flawed,"While Chang's narrative is compelling, the fact that she compiled most of her information from Chinese sources and uses Chinese government estimates leaves a great deal of doubt with regard to many of her assertions. Real historians have cringed at many of her suppositions, but the most ridiculous part of the book is when Chang plays armchair psychologist to explain the Japanese mindset. I would balance this book with Honda's to gain a little perspective. Still waiting for a good book on the subject by an actual historian without an agenda."
5,Great book,"Very good and accurate protryal of the Japanese disgraceful conduct in Nanking.Its a shame there are still Japanese cockroaches who deny what they had done in Nanking as well as atrocities commited on an immense proportion of the earth.....1931 in Manchuria - Unit 721 human experimtatations, to the Phillipines in 1942 -Bataan death march To Burma - Burma railroad where 20,000 POWS perished, To India, To the outer borders of Australia, to New Guiene, To singapore, To Java, To Indochina....you name it.1 in 3 Britsh died, 1 in 4 Australians died, 1 in 5 Americans died....for Asian POWS, OVER HALF of them perished.3% of Britsh, American and French died in German POW camps. But prisoners of the Japanese, 33% of prisoners died."
5,The Japanese Love This Book!,They haven't even bothered to publish a translated version.Too bad the author passed away yesterday - we need more people like her to bring these incidents to light.
5,Absolutely an inhuman holocaust!,"I learned a lot in detail about the most inhuman holocuast committed by Japanese troop in Nanking City during World War II from this book. IMHO, it is a book that tells you some real truth about WWII."
2,Don't read this book if you expect a fair presentation,"Don't read this book if you expect a fair presentation of facts...Though I'm impressed with the research Chang has done for this book, I'm particularly disturbed by the blatant bias Chang shown in her presentation. I thought I would read a book that would present the facts with no spin, but Chang used the facts in a way to condemn the Japanese for their atrocities. There's no question that the facts were self-evident, that the Japanese commited these atrocities, but Chang's tone was sacrastic and bitter, something you would not expect from a book like this. I'd expect Chang, who has worked as a journalist, to present the facts in a straightforward manner, and not present them in a bitter tone."
1,Iris Chang Errors,"The rape of Nanking was a horrible thing. However, I saw Chang on TV saying that the Japanese killed 20 million Chinese during the war. What she is talking about is the killing between Chinese Nationalist forces and the Communists under Mao. The Long March by the Communist forces was not about tea parties throughout China. Chang has to do more research about China in the 40s. And dear God, what about the Rape of Tibet? Tibet is about as Chinese as France is. Will China pay reparations and allow Tibetans to be Tibetans?"
1,Japanese evils?,"More than 60 years have passed since US attacked Japan with atomic bombs, and Japanese have claimed them as the victims of the use of nuclear weapons from then on. After I read Ms Chang's book, I begin to believe that at that time Japanese did deserve the bombs, and the justice has been done. In his review T.T.Saga said ""I don't have thorough academical knowledge about this historical matter,"" then based on what foundation did he draw the conclusion that ""this book is only scandalous one?"" The only explaination I can come up with is that either T.T.Saga drank too much saki or he shares the ideology with those excuted Japanese war criminals after WWII.Discount 2 bombs!"
4,Capt USMC,"This book is a must for all servicemen who serve in Asia. It will help to explain how 400,000 Women, children, elderly, and prisoners of war were raped and slaughtered in a month and a half. The author does not just blame the Japanese for their actions, but she tries to describe the Japanese mindset that could have caused these atrocities. The book is very well researched and a pretty easy, although gruesome, read. The last third of the book is excellent and ties up history from the end of WWII until the present. It describes the geopolitical tensions in this region and why the Japanese text books cause a major point of contention in this theater. Those who don't study history are bound to repeat it. I nominated this book for entry into the Marine Corps Reading List for what it has to offer."
3,Rape of Nanking is an extremely important hsitorical book,"It is disturbing and precise. One leaves the finished book with a clear understanding of how atrocities can be swept under the rug and history can be re-written by governments. The only criticism of the book lies in Chang's writing style. Had the book been less concerned with justifying itself and it's facts and written more cohesively and with broader style, the readability of the text would be greatly enhanced."
1,Do not fabricate our history!,"Chinese killed 300,000,000 Tibetans. (Actually 1,500,000)Americans killed 300,000,000 Vitnameses. (Actually 2,000,000)United Nations soldiers raped 30,000,000 Japanese women. (Actually 200,000)Chinese killed 20,000,000 Chineses. (<- Oh, this is true.)Why China does not stop this musty propaganda and America still support that?America needs something to discount their war crimes. China must turn Chinese people's attention from the discontentment with their distatorial government.Iris Chang is a sacrifice."
1,It would be the real tragedy.,"It would be the real tragedy if so many innocent Americans have been brainwashed into believing Iris Chang's ""The Rape of Nanking""."
3,The way people talk should tell something about them,"Why are those Japanese bashers so ignorant and barbaric? They just exclaim the hateful bigotry without any rational thinking, reminding me of religious fundamentalists. And why are those critical of Iris Chang more frequently educated and civil? This should tell something about Iris Chang too. Education should not indoctrinate; it should enlighten, which means open yourself up to self-criticism.By the way, contrary to the recently common accusation, Japan has made public apologies to China many times for what it did during the war. [...]What ""education"" are we talking about here? I'm not gonna start listing the atrocious instances of China's human right violation."
2,Important subject..really bad book,"I think the best thing this book has done is at least get people to think about what transpired when the Japanese invaded Nanking. However, from a historical perspective this book is badly researched and written. [...]"
4,A detailed book that does a great job!,"When I first read this book it seemed like another boring assignment. Boy, was I wrong. It was detailed and great for simple reading. I was hooked after one page. Iris Chang does a awesome job. Although it had graphical descriptions, she writes it so that you can keep reading without being to grossed out. There was a problem that I encountered though. There was a few thing that she(Iris Chang) left some details out. Overall though, this is a detailed book on the Nanking Datusha (Great Nanking Massacre) that does a great job shedding light on it. I congragulate this book, which jumped some hurdles and triumphed!"
3,Very stastisically accurate ; well-documented.,"Ms. Chang has done both the Chinese people and the larger world a great service by retelling the stories behind this senseless atrocity. The book must be included on high school and college reading lists with at least one mandatory book report assigned on the subject per year for all undergraduates. Lastly, Chang should explore the option of taking her project onto the college lecture circuit and getting grants from Japanese companies like Honda to fund her efforts."
3,A good account but incomplete,"Like the author's family, my own family survived the horror of the Nanjing Massacre (as known in Chinese), and the accounts I have heard from relatives all pointed to a much more macabre picture than Miss Chang paints in her good book. The way the Japanese army soldiers (many of whom, I should point out, came from Korea and Taiwan) committed the atrocities were simply unheard of. Having lived in Japan for a few years, I can clearly see how the Japanese mentality is pre-disposed toward cruelty -- just witness all the S&M movies out of Japan, which are ten times as sick as anything you find here in America."
4,Simple and easy,The device is both versitle and convenient. Having a built-in compartment to hold the plug sizes that aren't in use mankes it something that will be useful far past the first use.
4,Versatile - does the job!,"This unit is fantastic. Not the best quality but for the price does the job very well. I used it to replace the adapter on my router, charge my electric screw driver and power up some old electronics. Fantastic value.One of my gadgets required inverse polarity - and this really handled it very well.Will buy another for sure."
3,price ok but low quality,"Pros: Price, versatilityCons: lots of static sound, not very tight (connector lose contact if you move the cord)"
2,Cheaply made,This thing is put together with the least amount of circuitry and performs very poorly in use. Creates its own noise which makes it unusable on audio equipment such as small transistor radios or small audio amplifiers. Produces a very loud squeal which is so loud it makes the supply useless. I believe it would work fine gear that has no audio output but that is about all it would be good for. Comes with all the adapters for different power plugs and an external storage case for non used plugs which is a nice feature.
4,"Tasty Thriller, and Then Some","This book starts out being a slick thriller kind of a book. Lots of action, great sense of place, good characters. It's almost like the author couldn't help herself, though. The book starts getting bigger about half-way through. It has a lot to say about violence, and consciousness, and love as a source of profound disruption as well as joy. As a whole, I don't think The Blue Place works very well as a mystery. I think of it as more of a Jane Austin novel, a study of place and person. If that's your cup of tea, you might really enjoy this book."
3,Dangerous love story,"The Blue Place is a suspenseful tale about drug cartels and corruption, told by a strong, beautiful female protagonist kicking ass and taking names (pardon the cliché). I haven't read a suspense novel in years (circa 1998 when I devoured every Nancy Drew and Mary Higgins Clark book I could get my hands on). Now, I tend to go for the dramatic, overly literary books and suspenseful TV like Criminal Minds.This was a great book to break up my usual reading habits. It is a dangerous love story seamlessly integrated into a thrilling drama. When I say dangerous I mean that there are literally bullets flying, but the love story itself is dangerous in defying ""the norm."""
3,Nutcracker men,Lord Of The Nutcracker Men starts with a boy named Johnny. Johnny is ten years old. On his eleventh birthday he gets a small army of nutcracker men from his dad. In the book he acts out the war with them. This book was a boring book because you have to like war and know war to get what they are talking about. Some of the words were very hard to understand. If I were to recommends it to somebody they should be into war.
2,An interesting premise that Saul isn't able to fulfill,"(SPOILER WARNING)The idea of items that serial killers use containing a leftover ""evil"" power is a great idea. But Saul doesn't really use it much--he could have had the boys become ""possessed"" by the spirits of Lizzie Borden, Jeffrey Dahmer, Ed Gein, et al. But nothing really happens to the premise and the book concludes with ""Lizzie"" running amuck. (In fact, this was the real flaw in the book because the axe she was accussed of using was NEVER found.)And other than the subject matter, this is really a YA novel -- the main characters are teenagers and the secondary story -- ""townies"" versus the ""summer boys"" -- is merely filler and goes nowhere.Would have been much more interesting to see the ADULTS become slowly obsessed with the items. Again, interesting idea, just doesn't work."
4,enchanted knitting,"The patterns in this book are many, and very nice, from all over the world. Not all of them are usable, but that's a matter of appeal. Most patterns are quite big to knit up, not for small projects. You have to copy and enlarge them first because they're printed very small."
3,"Nice Designs, but charts are too big & hard to read!","I have to concur with the other reviews-- most of the charts are too large to use with an 8mm kniting machine or with hand-knitting. I like the idea that they are trying to show the grid-lines, because I sometimes had trouble with the charts in ""The tap-Dancing Lizard"", trying to figure out exactly how many stitches were in a large block of color. However, I think it could have been done better, in a way that was easier to read. Also, I wish the grid was marked with a heavier or colored line every five or ten stitches. Some of the designs are lovely, but simply too big for me to use unless I were making something huge like a blanket!"
3,"too much flailing, too theatrical","Lang Lang's histrionics--already criticised as exagerrated--detracts from the music. It distracts his listeners. His facial contortions during the finale of the Chopin nocturne is particularly irritating. Looking at him emoting I wondered: was he entering a trance or seeing an apparition of the Virgin Mary floating over the keyboard? For all his ecstatic displays, one expects his piano playing to be thoroughly and deeply in touch with the music. Sadly, at this stage of this promising pianist's career sometimes it is not, no matter how hard his facial muscles may try to convince us. Unless he's reached the musical sensibility of Glenn Gould (who disdained the vaudevillian in the concert stage; Gould would be horrified with Lang Lang), Lang Lang should concentrate the expressivity on his fingers, not on his face."
2,"Yep, it's really greasy","I read the reviews about this product here and elsewhere on Amazon and noted how some said it left their faces greasy. But since my skin was so dry and it was the dark of winter, I was sure it wouldn't be too much. Yep, it's greasy alright. And it makes my late 40s face break out. Nothing like having an adolescent sheen of grease and two huge zits on your chin to look younger. But that wasn't what I was hoping for when I wanted a product to restore youthfulness! I've used Dermalogica, Cellex-C, Obagi and other leading cosmetic lines, but Murad products definitely lead the way in leaving your face slightly waxy. I have the night products kit, too, with the cleanser, toner, age-diffusing serum, and night cream and I wake up with a sheen, too. But I can deal with it at night."
3,Jealousy in full colors,"I gave this book three stars because the main character, Leah, was absolutely horrible in it! Leah is overcome with jealousy with the arrival of a new ballet dancer to the school who she sees as a threat to her position as class favorite. In order to try and prove that she is a better dancer Leah tries to win a scholarship competition against her poor friend Katrina (who needs the money in order to stay in school). Her self-centered attitude made Leah hard to like in this book; it seems like she gets more like a prima donna every book!"
2,Need pictures please!,As an art techer there is no way I can put many of these ideas into practice. I need the visual part too!
2,Kind of plain. Didn't really like.,"This was just a plain, boring book. I tried reading it to my daughter before her 2 year old appointment, but she wasn't interested. I found the book pretty boring myself. It wasn't terrible, though. Definitely not worth the $4.00 I paid for it vs. the quality of other books I have bought on here for only $4.00."
5,Speaking to my heart,"The first stanza of The Tenth Muse continues to ""bring me to my knees."" Gail expresses in a few lines the excruciating pain of loving someone who is suffering from a mental disorder. By authentically and generously sharing her humanity she offers us the spiritual teaching and healing of knowing that we are not alone."
3,Good but not Great,"Smells like French parfum... which we really like, yet it seems to lack something. Not very distinct, just kinda like a good generic perfume smell."
5,good ignition,this ignition switch is pretty good and prety easy to instal the only thing is the keys feel like they would break easy
4,The Hilarity Continues,"Robot Chicken Star Wars III is not quite as funny as the first two, but it is worth a look. I'm not sure how a part IV would go over, as it's clear that the writers are really scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas. Even so, I give it a ""thumbs up""."
1,do not buy this item,"item was near splashing water, never submerged and got water moisture in left lens within first 30 minutes of use. so much for being water proof. product also says it floats, based on false waterproof claim, i would recommend not seeing if it floats! do your self a favor any purchase a different brand. horrible!"
2,Poor optical alignment,"Must be a hasty quality control process (if any exists at all) because it was quickly apparent that the optics were not properly aligned, and given the watertight construction there really isn't a way to adjust the flaw. More favorable reviews from others were probably the result of receiving satisfactory models, which I expect would be a good probability. Just my bad luck I guess."
2,Leak,They are much easier to see through but they leak in heavy rain. Its not terrible because I don't have carpet in my jeep so I can open up a drain plug to let the water out but it is annoying.
3,Not Bad,"I thought the book would contain more ""naughty"" paper folding examples, which is why I only gave it 3 stars, but the person who received it was happy with it."
4,"decent, for a six year old","This product will work quite well with XP or 2000. My daughter especially likes the explorer part. She has learned some things about ancient Egypt from this, and it seems to be getting her interested in other cultures. She is just now starting to get into the math CD, and it's a little hard for her, but she's catching on. Overall, it was a well-spent $19. It will work with Farstone's virtual CD, for those that are tired of saying ""don't touch the shiny part"" and washing CDs."
3,Good Funk,"Grand funk lives is NOT a LIVE album neither a traditional Grand Funk album.The songs on this album are much shorter than on the classics GF albums, a lot less funky or soul leaning more towards a classic heavy metal repertoire.This probably won't please a lot of GF fans, but still LIVES is good rockin' album.The sound and the production are good especially for a record made in the 80's when a lot of productions suffered from an overdose of keyboards or drum-machines.It is clear that this album won't(didn't)change the face of the earth but it sure didn't stop the world from going round.Short songs, straight to the point but also a very short album (around 30 minutes).LIVES is not a priority, I wouldn't start my G.F. collection with that one, but its much more inspired, exciting than the previous Good singin' good playin' or especially the following What's funk?"
3,A tribute? Not so sure about that.,"I was already in love with Josh Groban's fantastic voice and the beautiful songs he has sung for his previous albums. So I figured this piano version of those wonderful songs would be a nice addition to my album collection. Wrong. The pianist is of average capability, at best. I was expecting a very embellished, rich sound, but was disappointed at the mediocre arrangements. The piano part is musical, however, and is somewhat pleasant, but it's not dazzling. The whining, seedy sounding string sound is obviously the product of some type of synthesizer and does not do anything to make the music better. I found it overall rather a disappointment."
4,She Made Me A Fan,"I won't lie, I wasn't an Amerie fan. It wasn't until a trip to DC brought my attention to the song ""One Thing."" Then I saw the video and found out fine she was I became a believer. While I wasn't feeling all of the songs on th cd, she held my interest on the bulk of them. On every cd, ther is at least one favorite and for me it's a toss up between ""Talking About"" because of the beat and ""Just Like Me"" because of the words. Talented? Yes. Pretty as can be? Definitely. Is this CD worth buying? Handle your business and get it."
3,Greedy,"The CD is okay. I don't think it was a waste of money. There are a few good songs on it, although I wouldn't say every song is. What bothers me is that I purchased the cd, and can't dowload it to my ipod because it is protected. I paid money for the cd, I own it, I should be able to do with it what I want."
4,A good listen,"You either love her or you hate her! I personally enjoy her music. I think this second album is much better compared to her first album. Her vocals are decent and the sound is really crisp. She has some great love ballads and the album is 100% great to drive to. Not anyone can stand Amerie, so be warned, her voice can get kinda annoying at times."
5,Three great ways to not increase sales....,"These three episodes do have a common ground. In each, the store is attempting to increase sales, either through a promotion as in ""German week"" and the Great Gatsby episode, or through longer hours as in the third episode. Needless to say, the results are hilarious, but never more so than in the first episode, ""German week"", which ends in a magnificent German dance sequence.The British humor is unique, full of subtleties on one hand, and broadly humorous on the other. There are of course the running gags such as Mrs. Slocombe's cat, aka _____, and Captain Peacock's downward gaze whenever confronted by a woman with noticeable cleavage. But basically, it's the ability of the writers to catch the viewer offguard with the unexpected occurances. Each episode is well crafted, with both snappy repartee and sight gags.Very good for a laugh! Or for a lot of laughs, I should more aptly say."
4,"Dated, but still a good book for me","I agree with many of the otehr reviewers out there: there's no real cookbook for BW, and this one complicates matters by trying to cover two versions at once. But for me, it's proven to be a great book because it doesn't assume I'm an expert. As a new member of an existing BW Support team, I don't have to ask as many ""stupid"" questions now that I has this. And I got a great price on a used copy!"
2,disappointed,"The book not up to his usual standard, it also seemed too short so is the Kindle version a condensed version?"
2,Just another over-priced & poorly made Halloween costume,"Don't get me wrong, the costume gets the job done; however, it's just an outrageous price for the quality that you are getting. But hey, it's a Halloween costume, what could you expect? One thing to note is that the belt that comes with this will NOT work. I don't know exactly what they were thinking with that, but it's WAY too small (I believe another reviewer said the same thing). All in all - the costume looks good and is OK for one nights use."
3,"Looks pretty good, but be prepared to find another belt","I haven't bought a Halloween costume in ages, but I needed one for a Halloween themed community band concert. I've got to be able to sit in it, see the director and play my instruments. This fit the bill for that--unobstructed face and hands. The materials are OK.. I think it will last more than one wear. I ordered the XL. The 32"" inseam on the pants makes them a little short. Since they're elastic waist and it's covered by the tunic, the pants should be long so that they can be rolled over at the waist and shortened for shorter people but still long enough for tall people. Worse than that, though is the belt. The package says 38""-42"" waist. I normally wear a 40, but can wear a 38 that's a little snug. The belt is about 3"" short of coming together... must be about 32-34"". Will either have to mod or buy a different one of those. That's why I gave this 3 stars. It's a 4-piece costume with major issues in 1 piece and minor issues in another piece."
1,Doesn't work like it should,"After about a week of normal nighttime use, the filter needs changing! Ugh. It doesn't wick the water up anymore. I called Bionaire who said filters should last 4 weeks. They blamed hard water but we have Culligan soft water! So they sold me more filters and some water softener to use when I fill the basin to see if the filters will last longer. The filters also have a black layer that crumbles all over. Messy. I'm close to trashing it and buying another kind without a filter. My last Evenflo humidifier filter didn't behave this way; it stayed wet and continued working even with a 'full/dirty' filter so I'm not happy about the Bionaire stopping humidifying. Their processing takes 3 weeks for me to get the new filters and that's not acceptable.The unit is very quiet and you have to be careful when moving it otherwise it will spill but it's never 'leaked'."
5,Great book: get the 2nd edition,"The second edition was published in June 2005. Unless you're a computer historian, get the new one:(...)Great book. Marc Rochkind's book is also very good and surprisingly non-overlapping, considering."
5,The best reference for C programming under Unix Environment,"This book is the most complete reference about C programming under Unix Environment. It not only tells you how to use system calls, but also teaches you how the system calls actually works. Although it's written almost a decade ago, all contents are compliant to POSIX 1. So it's still useful to any *n*x operating system that are compliant to POSIX. If you will write programs that run under unix like system, this book is a must have."
2,disappointing,"It's not just that the rope work is sloppy, as other reviewers have mentioned. (It's also uncreative: there are many beautiful things you can do with rope if you use your imagination.) The main problem is that, with very few exceptions, these images are lifeless. The models look like statues with some rope around them.Also, you can tell that the photograph on the cover was airbrushed. (Among other things, a mole has been removed from the model's back.) That makes me wonder what else in this collection has been ""improved."" And frankly, it makes me wonder what the artist thought he was trying to accomplish with this project."
3,Nice Pan But Non-Stick Coating Comes Off,"Bought this about a year ago, and use it 1-2 times each week. It worked great until recently, when small areas of the non-stick coating started to flake off. I only use wooden or teflon utensils, and never put it in the dishwasher. I expected the coating to last much longer. Otherwise, I like the pan very much, but will not buy another."
4,Good collection of instrumentals,"This is a solid collection of rap beats to rap to. These instrumental versions to songs from previous Alchemist mixtapes are mostly great. Track 5 is a dark, gritty Mobb Deep beat and might even be the best beat on the cd. I don't know all the original artists to all of these beats, But i enjoyed this cd. Track 6 is an awesome beat as well which sounds like it could've easily been a Kanye West beat. Best beats on the cd are tracks 3, 5, 6, 10, and 12. I reccomend this to aspiring rappers, dj's, and beat junkies."
2,Nothing new over the original manual,This book didn't tell me much more than the original manual does. I would not recommend that you purchase this book if you have the original manual. There is only a couple of things that I learned from this book that the original manual did not have.
2,A tough review,"I bought the 10 piece set for my wife for Christmas one year ago. Initially we loved the set. They heated up quickly and heated more evenly than the Farberware we had before. Points scored on that gift! Then, after about 6 months we noticed are most used pot was chipping on the inside. We always cleaned by hand and used Calphalon tools. I, like many others, read excellent reviews online prior to purchasing. I'm not sure if this is a problem with the whole line or just my set, but I am inclined to throw them away and try something else. The price just doesn't match the quality. Once the ""non-stick"" is chipped off, everything sticks and burns immediately. If you're thinking about purchasing an entire set, I strongly recommend you attempt to buy a single piece and give it a few trial months before you drop the cha-ching."
2,Non-stick that dosen't,"I really wanted to love these pans after reading the reviews. I've followed all their instructions (how to preheat, the butter test, how to wash, don't use cooking spray, etc), yet unless I use oil or butter the non-stick is horrible. I eat a lot of egg whites and cooking them is a nightmare, adding butter would defeat the purpose of eating egg whites. Not impressed. The 4 year old T-FAL set I gave away that these were supposed to replaced where far better pans."
3,"Heavily-padded history, much of which we already know","For those who know little about the history of the KGB's machinations abroad, both evil and farcical, this is an excellent starter. Andrews writes clearly and forcefully in a manner which overcomes the deadening effects of the acronyms scattered across each page. But for those who familiar with the KGB and its role abroad, this is surprisingly thin fare. Andrews quotes from a huge number of books and other texts, mentioning Mitrokhin in passing when his archive can add to our knowledge of a particular episode. Apart from revealing the existence of the so-called ""granny spy"" Melita Norwood and some interesting material on what the KGB was up to in Poland in the 1970s and 1980s, there is not much new here. I note that Andrews and Mitrokhin intend to use other parts of the archive to write a second book. I only wish they had produced one thumping work, full of juicy details, rather than decided to spin out the material"
3,Interesting (but valid ?),"Reading The Triumph and the Glory, novelist Steven Edward Rustad's first book in his highly-touted Cold War series, got me interested in the topic so I picked up a copy of The Sword and the Shield. Pretty heavy reading, folks, but interesting, at times even borders on fascinating. This one though, is going to appeal mainly to the spy buffs and their crowd, it is necessary to be somehwat familiar with cold war era history and the processes of espionage to truly get the most from this book. I don't know if the Mitrokhin Archive is real or not, there seems to be some controversy here, it remains to be seen whether there is a factual basis for this book ot whether this is, ironically, misinformation put together by someone with his own agenda (like making money)"
3,fun,Loretta La roche has written another fun look at life. Good to dip into or a quick cover to cover read.
3,"King of Mulberry street is good, but not top of the food chain","What would you do if you were stranded in a country where you didn't speak the language or know anyone? Well the King of Mulberry street is about an opportunistic kid who faces these as well as many challenges. This book was a good story but didn't really have too much suspense or action in it. I didn't have trouble putting it down but wouldn't rate is as poorly written. I can see how it could get young adult readers into the genre of immigrant fiction, but as an adult - it wasn't overly cheesy or unrealistic."
2,The theory is great - it's the man who is a fake.,Everyone needs to read the article in the Feburary 1999 issue of Horse and Rider. Then make your decision if you want to send this man your money.
1,his way of training is dangerous,"A good trainer will keep in mind safty for the animal . A GREAT TRAINER will keep in mind safty for himself, the animal, the people around him or her, and the people watching especially children they see something that looks easy and a shortcut they will try it Monty Roberts ego is bigger than he is and that make hhim dangerous.My name is Michael Barrington, I am 15yrs. old if I can see this What is wrong with the rest of these 5 star people."
3,Hellbound/The Hitman/ Forced Vengeance DVD,"I like the Chuck Norris movies. Hellbound and The Hitman are somewhat different than most. The biggest problem was The Hitman had terrible sound levels. I had to turn the TV on full volume in order to hear the dialog, then reduce the sound for the music! The TV has adjustments so that will not happen, but it didn't help!"
3,Only liked the Hitman,"I only really liked The Hitman, out of the three movies. I wouldn't say that I disliked the other two. I just found them so-so. Everybody has different taste in movies. I'm sure other people would disagree. It isn't that I don't like Chuck Norris, I like some of his movies. No complaints about the quality of the DVD. As far as I can tell it is a good transfer. Good picture. Sound was fine. I've seen some movies that wasn't recorded very well. I don't remember ever watching any of these movies, so I don't know if they cut scenes out of them. I had a movie I purchased once and it didn't have all of the scenes in it. I had seen it on television so I knew it had been cut. The quality of the picture wasn't to hot either! I returned it. I didn't purchase it here."
1,Maybe 'Away from my desk' but NOT away from his ego,One of the worst travel books I've read of late. Rif is an insensitive writer who seems to be obsessed with trying to be funny and has no capacity to be anything but a self absorbed [individual] as he travels around the world with a companion who's in all likelihood as shallow as he is. Read at your own peril.
1,Terrible,"I am a big fan of travel essays, but this book was not at all enjoyable. It reads about as dry as a Frommer's. By making the trip with his girlfriend, the author seldom involves himself with the locals. What little involvement there is is superficial at best. If you are looking to learn about people, look elsewhere. If you are looking to learn about landmarks, buy this book."
5,best laser level,"PLS makes the best, most accurate laser tools out there. This one is great for a few reasons: very accurate, comes with a pouch for your toolbelt, and comes with a magnetic bracket which also fits on the pouch. It also has plumb beams, level beams, both plumb and lever beams, and both beams out of level situation allowing you to project to beams at 90 degrees to each other (perfect for setting tile)."
1,is this Einsturzende Neubauten?,"If you're looking for disco remixes of Einsturzende Neubauten, this is your opportunity to have it; But bear in mind: this has nothing to do with Einstúrzende's music; And personally, I don't like it."
4,Good Game,"Yes, this is a lot like Mortal Kombat 4, but I enjoyed the new characters and the new fighting grounds. I never had Mortal Kombat 4, and when I got my Dreamcast, I figured I'd go with this one. It is fun with good graphics, but the shadows could have been a lot better (they are little stick figures). But, all the blood and gore returns to this title. It's a good game, but if you have Mortal Kombat 4, then don't bother to buy it."
2,Same Old MK,"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ............. If you've play Mortal Kombat before THERE IS NO REASON TO BUY THIS GAME. Theres really nothing new,even the FMVs are pretty lame. Save your money for Soul Calibur."
4,13 year old frequent gamer,Mortal kombat gold was a lot like mortal kombat 4 for nintendo 64. But I loved it because they have my favorite characters Sub-Zero and Jax.I hope thy come out with another game before they shut down the Dreamcast industry.Also I think they should team up with capcom and have CapcomVsMortal Kombat where we could see Ken blow Sonya to bits with his Hadouken fatality.
1,Worst video I've seen,"This is an awful video. The voices are nowhere close to matching the lips. The beginning of the film is interspersed with old movie clips containing African American actors, and this seriously detracts from the actual file footage of the video. It appears that people with little or no technical background in putting videos together worked on this project. I'd advise looking elsewhere for footage of Malcolm X. This video is amateurish and not worth the money."
2,Get what you pay for.,"For the price this tent has some really nice features, all the seams are factory taped it has the bathtub floor, nice size. However it is not approaching freestanding and hard to make taut even with stakes. The gusset where the center pole met the roof broke the second time I put it up, it wasn't tightened properly but amazon was really good about the return process. This tent wasn't right for me but if you live in an area with soil that accepts stakes well and make sure to tighten/check the gusset it could be right for you."
2,Not for wet climates- poor setup,"Weight-wise, this was a fine purchase- I could barely feel it on my pack. That's pretty much where the good part ends. Even with the claims about the material and stitching keeping the inside dry, this tent still leaked all over me all night. The ceiling sweated, the walls sweated, the floor sweated- not a great way to spend a 40-degree NH night.When it comes to setup, it could use a lot of work. The stakes and poles provided are poor at best when it comes to staying put, and the ""main"" pole that sits in the middle of the tent door is easily knocked over whenever you bump it even slightly.Don't be fooled by the low price- upgrade to a better item."
5,beautiful!,"This shirt is beautiful everything is on there to make it a great heavy metal shirt. They of course have the Motorhead monster on the front which is beautifully drawn. accompanied around the sleeves are chains that circle all the way around. And the Motorhead England on the back. This is a very beautiful shirt, whether you are a true Motorhead fan or just a poser wanting to be heavy metal, you should get this shirt. It's worth every penny"
3,The best first half hour of any Wee Sing tape,"As I said, the first half hour of this tape is the greatest. My toddler and I both love it, and that's saying alot for a baby tape :-). It features lots of nursery rhymes placed into a fun plot that has enough adult humor to keep me from tearing my hair out. However, after that, this tape has far too much story for my child to follow, and very little singing to boot. We tend to rewind after 30 minutes and watch the beginning again. Perhaps a child over 2 would enjoy this tape in its entirety. We shall see..."
4,Happiness and merriment in the king's palace,"A very cute video. It's nice to see a king who is happy and jolly instead of being impetuous and prone to angry outbursts. And the part near the end where a boy gives King Cole his most prized possession is quite touching. Next stop: ""The Big Rock Candy Mountains""? --- Paul H!"
4,Mixed blessing,I seen the movie and as always the book was so much better. I really enjoy stories that make you feel good.
2,A little too repetitive,"This book was okay, but I thought Danielle Steel could do better. All three stories were too repetitive. They all had to do with people having babies and people being sterile. I also think that the story of Diana and Andy was too far fetched because she got pregnant even though she was presumably sterile and had a one in ten thousand chance of getting pregnant. I think D.S. fans should consider reading it though, because everyone has their own opinion."
4,"Easy install, Nice design, Pricey for molded plastic","I have owned a number of MaxxAir products over the years and overall I have been pleased with them. It is nice MaxxAir continues to refine their product and the new hinges will make cleaning under the vent much easier than non-hinged models. The plastic housing is durable, but they will begin to ""chalk"" after a few years. I would consider a 5 star rating, however, the value vs. materials used do not justify the price, but they know your options are limited.One important suggestion. Spray the wing nut fasteners which hold down the non-hinged side with a anti-corrosion spray such as Corrosion Pro or T-9 BoeShield. The nuts are aluminum and the posts stainless. The result will be corroded/frozen nuts in a reasonably short period of time if an anti-corrosion inhibitor is not applied. If you have not used T-9 Boeshield, you will be very pleased if you try it. It does a very good job slowing down the corrosion process with dissimilar metals."
1,Don't waste Your Time,"I don't think there is an original thought here. Sylvia is just a rip off of those who have gone before her, and she doesn't even do a good job of that."
1,mis represented product,"i bought this pan to make crepes. if you look at the photo in the promo, you will see that it is a smooth 13 inch pan. this pan came in with the grill bottom and not smooth but with ridges.since i had the pan delivered in florida i dont live at that home full time it is over a month. so they wont let me return it and told me its just too bad for me.i am very disappointed at amazon for their bad attitude"
5,The most honorable politician,"In short, the book describes the most honorable man ever to hold political office.....either at the State or National level. I am proud not only to know Mike Mansfield, but to be a Montanan as well. Jeanette Rankin, C.M. Russell, and Mike Mansfield......what a trio! God Bless a GREAT American and his lovely wife, Maureen!"
5,A don't miss read,This was the first in a series of three books that I know I will read more than once. A great story of forgiveness and a wonderful love story. It also had just the right amount of humor and will keep your interest until the end.
3,gift,was given as a gift; i have no idea how he liked it. this 2x disc set was on his list. he has always been an selfish little punk anyway...no more gifts from me.
3,not so fabulous,"This tape was good as far as showing all the classic moments (which you can see most of them if you have the Dvd's of Series 1-3)For collector purposes it's good to have, but it lacked in what was supposed to be a day in the life of Eddy while she flashes back to moments from series 1-3..the ""day in the life"" segments are kind of cheesy and not really that funny."
3,Interesting,"I think this may work for some people, but I am suspicious of any book that tells you that you only have to work out for half an hour a week to get good results. I tried the method detailed in the book (extremely slow and intense lifting without a break for half an hour) and didn't find it to be as effective for me as stated. However, that said, I am sure it does work for some. For me, the main benefit of this book is the detailed instructions he provides on how to use various weight lifting machines."
5,The miles fly by!,"There are lots of miles of roads in AK, and driving them can be a bit boring. Unless you have the milepost to guide you. There are interesting things happening all along the roadside, and a long road trip will whiz by when you are aware of what you are seeing, or can anticipate what is coming up around the bend.Well worth the investment."
3,Vampiric Blackmetal,"Siebenbürgen means Transylvania... The lyrics are in Swedish, and are about, yes, Vampires... The music is not very advanced, but overall ok melodies."
1,Don't buy this. horrible product,"I bought this one for my kids. It only last less than 3 months. when I call them. They told me the warranty is handled by retailer, unfortunatlly, I bought this from online store. which is impossible for me to arrage to fix. Just like most online cheap store, they don't even want to talk to me.I have to find someone locally to fix it. but it broken again after 2 month.Right now, I just trow it to the trash can and bough new yamahoo one. MUCH BETTER.PS. I also called their headquate office which is located in LA, I am happen in LA too, they refuse to help to fix and insist I have to talk to orginal retailer.I won't no buy any thing from this BRAND or recommend this BRAND to anyone."
2,Poorly written,Mr. Crichton should obtain a proficient editor and publisher; did he really write this? The writing is childish. There are numerous punctuation mistakes. Certainly is an interesting story - may make a great movie. But not a great book by any means.
1,Major Disapointment,"This book stated off with such potential, and then just fell flat on its face. The posibilities with the quantum foam / multi-verse idea were amazing, the reality was a book written simply to become a movie. He has clearly recognized the fact that his name alone sells, and that is good enough to for him. I would say check this one out from the library, maybe if enough people hit him in his wallet then he would write the quality stuff that made him in the first place. I would not recommend this book."
2,Stick figures galore.,"I haven't actually finished Timeline yet, so my review is based on the first two thirds of the book. I've read worse books, but this one is far from good. By biggest problem is that there does not appear to be a single character (with the possible exception of Kate) to care about. All of them are stick figures--no past, no future, just filling a hole in the plot. Also, there's lots of techno-babble about parallel universes, blah, blah, blah. It becomes mind-numbing without being convincing. But I'll finish the book. I'm just hopeful I'll remember this book when Crichton publishes his next one. Excellent Crichton books like the Andromeda Strain seem to exist in another universe--the one where the writing is convincing and the peril seems real. Sigh."
2,Skip it,"Seemed to be quite predictable and totally unbelievable, not just the science stuff but the super getaways as well."
3,"A fast, fun read but be prepared for disappointments","A great cast of characters and an intriguing idea about time travel, but the looming problem with the book is the formula it follows. The plot twists are predictable at times and even downright tiresome. However, that doesn't stop you from turning the pages and plunging into another one of Crichton's worlds."
3,wake up and finish the book,"Although it started with an interesting spark, it quickly became almost painfully uninteresting to read. However, if you can stay awake long enough, that will change. The last 2/3rds of the book builds quickly and won't let you go. Timeline started with 1 star and ended with a 5."
4,A Time Travel Masterpiece!,"Michael Crichton's writing was foreign to me until 'Timeline.' He kept me on the edge of my seat whether it was at home, in a cab or while I was flying...I could not wait to get to the next page of this adventure set centuries ago in France. He wraps it up with an ending that gives the reader closure with contentment. I have given this book as a gift in the recent past, I recommend it that much. Looking for a great adventure in time travel? You found it with ""Timeline."""
2,The Bibliography is great.,"The bibliography (a rare thing in modern fiction books!) is great. There is a wealth of historical and scientific books to research.I am not a Crichton fan, I bought and read this book because I am terribly medieval. As far as the medieval authenticity of the book, I think its very valid. Crichton writes with ease about a hisorical period that is often misunderstood. The character of Andre Marek, with his seemingly impossible knowledge of medieval times, is also the most endearing; and the end of the book will leave people wondering about him.In the acknowledgments, Crichton writes: ""This is a novel: time travel rests firmly in the realm of fantasy."" That being said, even fantasy science can be somewhat believable. I can wrap my mind around plausible, but only if I can follow what's being said. I couldn't follow, after awhile, the science of the novel. That led to me skipping a page here and there."
5,Timeline,This is one of the best books I've read. It's fast paced and vastly entertaining. I couldn't put this book down until I finished it and then I wanted to read it again!
3,A Timely Alternative,"If you want to read some really wonderful books about time travel, scroll up to search and type in Connie Willis. The ""Domesday Book""is a magical treatment of time travel and ""To Say Nothing of the Dog"" is a delightful Victorian/WWII adventure. As for Timeline, wait for the paperback."
1,"He contradicts himself in the afterword, among other crimes","Many people have already pointed out the multitudinous errors that bugged me, so just allow me to add one more. In the afterword, Crichton writes that the medieval times were in fact, not more violent than our own, and perhaps were even less so. He rather piously criticizes those ""pompous academics"" who would continue to promote this misconception.Well, that's an interesting claim following 500 pages describing characters being relentlessly beheaded, burned, imprisoned, shot with arrows, tortured, jousted, stomped with horses, chased, raped, raped anally with hot pokers, disemboweled, splashed with hot pitch, dropped to their death from great heights, slashed, hung...did I miss anything else?"
5,WOW! A Fantastic Journey!,"I'm a time travel nut so when this book came out I HAD TO HAVE IT! I'm so glad I did. The story line is great and the characters (all archeologists) are believable. It's got suspense, romance, adventure...everything! Michael Chrichton has a great story here...read it!"
1,Very disappointing,"I am still waiting for Michael to include a death scene involving Elmo, Ricky Martin, and Rosie O'Donnell in one of his books...and I thought this would be the one."
4,Timeline,"Michael Crichton scores again with Timeline! Just a couple technicalities glazed over that were covered more thoroughly in Jurassaic Park. Strict entertainment, of course. But Michael, ""Jesus Christ"" is not the only profanity in the world. And as much as I like reading your novels, it really does insult my personal saviour. Please search for another one for your next novel. I will probably buy it - Sooth! (For sooth, and notwithstanding.)"
3,Timeline,"A combination of imaginable theory and historical records is never easier. However, made such an product recreational and educational is much more difficult. I think the author did a quite satisfactory job that only a few could accomplish.Do you notice any explanation how a historical time were designated? I didn't find any of it. Another interesting thinking is that do you ever wonder what ""historical research"" Marek would do in fourteen century England or France, and if so, how? Due to his very unique position and situation in ""history"", he may suffer a lots if he want continuing his career as a historical scholar."
1,movie script...,"The book has no character development and an obvious plot. He describes the technology in detail, but leaves the cookie-cutter adventure characters up to your imaginiation. It's a quick adventure story written for money and the movies. I may actually like the movie better than the book if it's done."
2,What's up with that?,"Well, this one was worth a discount rack paperback edition, as far as I'm concerned. Unfortunately, I bought the hardcover. Anyway, my main problem with the book is that these characters aren't worth it for you to care about what happens to them in the 14th century. What Crichton does do best in this book, however, is what he's always done best: he is able to describe complicated scientific hypotheses in very clear and very interesting language. The parts of the book that describe how time travel works in a quantum universe were the most interesting. My advice, though, a re-read of Sphere (one of my favorites) would make for a better book."
3,"page turner, but...","A real page turner, but tiresome after awhile. Heroes always have a quick, convenient way out. Reader begins not to worry, since in less than a page, the obstacle is overcome, and a new one presented...again, and again, and again...."
2,We expect better from Crichton,"I think of Crichton as a master of ""science versimilitude"" as well as a superior craftsman of the straight out thriller. Well, not this time. The science here is a weak and inconsistent hodge-podge to explain the time travel ( and Crichton himself says so in his Acknowledgements ). The characters here are the usual interchangeably forgettable group of every Crichton novel. Only the action scenes and cliffhangers are above average and , at that, will work better as a movie than a book. So, overall, this one rates an OK, but we have come to expect better from this seaoned writer."
4,Great Beach or Plane read,"As with other Crichton, zero characterization, but a great one-flight or beach read. After a somewhat tedious start, really pulls you along. Perfect Spielberg fodder."
3,ok but not his best,"This book is ok as far as entertainment is concerned. There are a few inconsistencies tho that neither the author nor the characters satisfactorily explained. It's supposed to be another universe but how come events that happened there came to be history here too. Then too the time that elapsed, one day there can be an instant or a century here, right? It's the dilemma of every time travel novel that needs to be explained before it can ever be accepted even in theory. Still pretty good reading considering although the ending is anti-climactic and totally predictable."
5,Another Crichton Classic,"This book enters into the same category of The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic park, as far as originality and a perfect balance of real life facts and imagination. It introduces many interesting ideas, having to do with what is known about midaeval times, and possible assumptions that could be made. It also includes thought-provoking ideas about the future of technology, and what could be possible. A very entertaining read from beginning to end, i recomend this book to any fans of the aforementioned books, as well as anyone who enjoys books about midaeval times."
4,FIRST AMONG EQUALS,"For anyone wanting a rattling time travel yarn this is a satisfying read. And if you LOVE a great time travel story then check out the master, Jack Finney and his collection THE THIRD LEVEL. Another recent time travel novel that will have you turning the pages late into the night has to be THE FALL by Brit writer Simon Clark. As well as being a thumping good read he's also incorporated a unique time travel experiment in the book which will leave you trying to figure out what really was the result of the experiment. And don't forget to check out Baxter's THE TIME SHIPS that sequels Wells' classic THE TIME MACHINE."
1,Timeline - One audio book that I couldn't finish.,I tried for 4 tapes to get interested in this book and could not do it. I put it up and tried again later and still thought it was one of the books that I would throw away. Wasted money. I never did finish it. My daughter read the book and she didn't finish it either.
2,Crichton's worst,"I have read several of Crichton's books, and this is his worst by far. The story just repeats itself over and over. Week plot. Could have been much better. I normally like all of Crichton's work, but not this time. If I had to read one more fight scene - I think I would gag."
4,Cannot put this one down!,Crichton has done it again with this suspensful book about a group of historians who get more than they bargained for when they actually travel back to the 1300's to rescue their lost professor. The writing is fast paced and on the edge of your seat. If you buy this book (which you should)be sure you have a good amount of time to read because once you start you won't want to put it down. I eagerly await his next work.
4,sir victor,"I'm not a huge Crichton fan, but that said I really enjoyed this book. I was really taken by the time period and found myself transported along with the rest of the characters into the middle of knights and damsels in distress. I enjoyed the movie-like descriptions of the places.I appreciated the historical details. They were accuratly and artistically described. I'm sure the movie, when it's finally made will be a disappointment. The version in my head would cost way too much to produce."
3,Tick-Tock,"Indeed! Take a bit of science conjecture (guess at best) and throw a little middle-age barbarism into the mix, then strand a bunch of contemporary grad students into a situation where they have absolutely NO business...; its a Michael Crichton novel! I did like this book based on my old ""suspension of disbelief"" credo, and I liked the technical front to the story of ""quantum foam"" ( a scientific hypothesis ). There is a lot of action and suspense in this work , worthy of Michael Crichton, and his view of the deadly up-front day to day struggles for survival of the peasants stand as testament to the progress we as a race have made in these hundreds of years - despite what we may be fed daily in the media. A good read. Take some time with it and absorb the sub-plots. I like a good ending, and this has a goodly fair to fairly good one."
3,Not his best,"One of Michael Crichton's strong points is taking a seemingly ridiculous idea (i.e., bringing dinosaurs back to life) yet making you believe that that idea is somehow feasible. Crichton fails to do that in this book. In Timeline, I looked forward to a good explanation of how time travel might be possible. Instead, Crichton gives us a mess of incredibly confusing scientific jargon; which, I expect, he assumed readers would quickly read through in order to get to the action. This would ordinarily not be such a bad thing-- if the action was riveting."
3,Brutal and Cheesy,"Chricton's a good author, so Timeline is still a great ""fun"" book to read. However, it has two very large faults.Firstly it is brutal. This may be the result of a Medieval setting, but the neverending killing gets tiring. How many ""He sliced his sword through his innards"" does he need?Secondly, it is cheesy. A geeky 10 year old solves the mystery of the mad scientist. The friend of the ""lost"" timetravelers figures out how to get them back by thinking about auto reasoning.Every 5 pages end with a cliffhanger (many of which are ""She knew that So-and-so is now dead."") Sure enough So-and-so shows up three pages later. Good grief!If you like Chrichton, read ""Eaters of the Dead,"" ""Great Train Robbery,"" or ""The Terminal Man,"" instead."
3,Still better than other science-based fiction,"But not as good as I'd expect from Crichton. However, that may have a lot to do with my not being very interested in Medeival history. IMHO, there was too much action and not enough science involved in the plot.I'd put this at the bottom of a ranking of Crichton's novels, but still worth reading for entertainment."
4,A Knight to Remember,"Having taught Medieval history, I am well aware how infrequently the era is addressed in popular culture. In spite of the cult of Creative Anachronism who recreate this era, few people seldom get it right. It is obvious that Crichton has done his research well. His tale is fascinating and accurate. It has high adventure and great suspense. It is not a classic by any means but it is a highly enjoyable read. It is further amazing that Crichton combines high technology and science with Medieval lore and culture. It is a highly appealing mix and he handles them both very well. This is a perfect light read for anyone who wants to take themselves into another world. My only criticism of it is that it seems to be written towards a screenplay format...so the movie shouldn't be far behind. It would have been nice if it had more of a literary feel. But that is a minor complaint. Mount your steed and charge into this book with abandon. You won't be sorry."
4,"Good, until the end","This book was so great, possibly the best book I had ever read...until the end. The ending was very disappointing."
1,Time Lost,"I have to admit I have never read any works by Michael Crichton, so my opinion of his writing rests solely in this less than appealing novel. Rarely are you within 100 pages of completing a book and feel utterly frustrated with the author, the characters, the plot, and the hollywood direction the story is taking. This book did just that. Time after time, the characters are narrowly escaping grim death. Time after time, the characters are reunited only to be separated again. This was like watching a terrible movie."
3,Could have been much better,"With such a great concept, this could have been much better. I usually can't put Crichton books down but I had to work to wade through this, at times. And the many, many plot holes were big enough to drive trucks through. The unnecessarily gory violence could have been much more subtly handled. A disappointment"
3,Too long.,"A bit of a disappointment. I can appreciate the research, the science and the history but this book goes on and on and on and...Each event is predictable and ultimately boring. Also there are bad editing errors which detract from the action. How can a character be on a beam she thinks is too wide (six inches) on one page and cross to another ""smaller"" beam that is a foot wide 2 pages later? Did more than one person write this book?It's frustrating when an author writes the movie before he's even finished the book!"
1,"Awful, awful, awful","Save your money. This book has obviously been written as a prequel to a future movie. No doubt both book and movie will make Mr. Crichton tons of money. But the book is still awful. It's the 21st century's version of ""The Perils of Pauline"", with every chapter (and sometimes page) leaving one or more of the protagonists in a cliff-hanger situation. If your IQ is no higher than the price of this book, go ahead -- you might enjoy it."
5,Blending of Fact and Fiction,"Science fiction based on fact and set in the not too distant future is a hallmark of Michael Crichton. The story will entertain readers who enjoy science fiction adventures as well as those who enjoy period pieces set in medieval Europe. The science is based on enough fact to make the story interesting. The story itself moves quickly, and keeps you in suspense. There are some holes in the company owner's character, which do not make sense except as representing a steriotype; but that is minor criticism of an otherwise fun, fast read."
4,One for the Road,"The CD version of Timeline is a great piece of entertainment to listen to while you are driving somewhere. It has lots of action and an interesting plot. It is full of imagery. It reads almost like a screenplay, and it's hard to imagine that the author didn't expect it to appear as a movie. I give it four stars for entertainment on the road, or entertainment anytime. It almost reminds me of a Tom Swift novel, but I mean that in a good way--old-fashioned mystery, action, and fun. Nothing heavy here. Just fun."
2,Uggghhhhh!,"When I first heard about this book, I thought it would be a very good Science Fiction book with plenty of adventure. But as I got into it, I thought it was very boring and didn't have enough science in it. Also, I think this book would have been better without all the swearing. Now, this is the first Crichton book I've tried to read, and I recently learned that his books generally have swearing in them, but in my point of view, they'd be better off without it. I didn't even finish this book, and I don't plan to, either."
1,Absolute junk.,"This ill-conceived and badly written trash doesn't deserve comment. I'm using this space to alert discriminating readers to one of the best, and long-neglected writers in the English language. Patrick O'Brian. If your tastes run to history/adventure, wedded to literature, read his seafaring tales in the Aubrey/Maturin series. You'll not be disappointed."
2,Addendum,"After writing my original review, I went back and read more of the other reviews. I would like to apologize- there were in fact many other Americans who thought this book was one big cliche. Maybe American culture isn't in such a bad place after all! And to all you 5-star reviewers who tell us dissenters to lighten up- Crichton has written much better books and I'm sorry if I expect more from him now. No, I'm not looking to him for literature, but for at least something original. I think I'll start a club for all the others who hated this book- you seem like my kind of people."
2,Far from his best,"I had the impression I was reading a description of Riven or some other computer game, rather than a book. Unlike Congo, Eaters of the Dead and Sphere, the science is minimal, unbelievable and uninteresting. The plot moves from event to event in a plodding, uneven fashion. Look, I'm a big Michael Crichton fan, and I'll read most anything he writes. But I had the impression he scribbled this between ER episodes, or while reading old Scientific American issues. I just think he didn't put enough effort into the story."
5,Bravo!,Bravo!This book deserves a standing ovation!Chrichton does it again by weaving an interesting tale of medieval culture with modern science. This is a must read for sci-fi readers and history buffs alike.
3,About what you'd expect,"Crichton writes movies. His novels are always screenplay-ready. I'm not a fan of his, for that and many other reasons. I read this book because, well, because I'm a medieval junky. My complaints about this are those I have with all Crichton novels. Predictable plot, two dimensional characters and overall shininess being chief among those. This was an amusing diversion nonetheless.The basic story is about a group of historians traveling back to the 14th century and getting into some adventures. The main flaws I can find in the portrayal of the middle ages are slight and mainly have to do with a glossing over of the medieval mindset to make it more accessible to the average modern reader. He does have a nice bibliography, though"
1,Can't believe I read this...,"...I wish I could go back and stop myself from doing so, it really was terrible - like a bad episode of Sliders gone horribly wrong, and that's really not saying much.extremely predictable with atrocious characterisation, read just like a template for a bad sci-fi film (and, god forbid, I just read it's actually being made...)I gave it one star only because I couldn't give it no stars.Quite simply a waste of effort, time and money."
5,Excellent adventure story,"I must say that it was a great adventure story. Very good page turner. I don't know if the historical facts are very accurate, but still, it makes a great story. Try to ignore the technical aspects of the book ;) They just don't add up. Definately worth reading."
3,A tiresome trip to the past,"While I thought the story iself was fairly imaginative, I thought the time spent in the ""past"" was an enormous amount of boring running around, one silly life-threatening event after another. Sometimes I couldn't even quite understand the physical circumstances in which these events took place. I was just so glad to finally finish the book."
3,Half finished and fairly disappointed,"I am a huge Crighton fan and have read all but 2 of his books, but in his latest work, I feel that he is compromising something. I think this is a fun, light read, but not impressed. MC needs to go back and visit his original writing style and I think he will be on top again."
4,Good use of history!!,"This novel falls slightly short of masterpiece, but does not disappoint you in any way. Good mix of history, science and thrill!!"
5,Come on guys...this book was great,"You really have to have an appreciation for new scientific ideas for this book to have a lot of meaning. The idea that time is not a place to go to, but rather a parallel existence will be difficult for many to grasp. Lots of people are jumping on the bandwagon saying that the villian was trying to create a theme park. This is not the case. His purpose was to restore castles exactly as they appeared in the past. Yes, his intentions were to make a profit, but not a theme park. Timeline has more non-stop adventure than any of the books that the author has previously written. He does an excellent job of mixing the past with the present. This book has gotten a bad wrap by the other people that have reviewed the book."
2,Connecticut Yankees in Jurassic Park,"This book takes the high-tech underground lab of ""The Andromeda Strain,"" the constant threat of dismemberment of ""Jurassic Park,"" and the ubiquitous robotic characters of ""West World"" and mixes them all together. The problem is that the robots are all supposed to be human!Despite the massive bibliography showing what appears to be a superhuman research effort, Crichton's inability to make a convincing human character or plot twist gives his feudal setting all the believability of an evening at the ""Medieval Times"" dinner theater."
3,Timeline-Crichton,"Crichton book, sci-fiction? Hmm well i gave it a try.. This book tells the story of time travelling. How? Ofcourse with a time machine. I never believed in time travelling but as always Crichton trows a lot of ""real"" information at you. You almost get the feeling that time travelling is possible. The story in this book is good but sometimes a little slow. No doubt the best part of the book is when a team goes back in time to save a dude stucked in time against evil knights.If you really like an adventure book read crichton's lost world it's better."
1,Comic Book,"Anyone who has read Connie Willis' excellent ""The Doomsday Book"" will recognize it in Crichton's cartoonish comic book rendition of this Middle Age time travel story. It's simply ""Jurassic Park"" in a castle. Delete ""raptor"" and insert ""Knight"". Same story, same characters, same sacrifice of historical accuracy for the sake of thrills."
2,His second worst,"This is perhaps the Crichton's second worst book after Lost World. This is an insult to science fiction enthusiasts. I think he should call this a screenplay rather than a novel. Mr Crichton has been completely sold out to Hollywood......I was extremely disappointed as I am a huge fan of his writing. My favorite being the ""The Great Train Robbery"" and ""Jurassic Park"". This book has very little scientific content and whatever little there is , is also very unconvincing."
3,Goodline,"This book is nonstop action but too nuch like JP to be great. The characters were pretty shallow and the dialogue was a bit lame but it was a really interesting story and a good sci-fi book, although all the science is revealed rather quickly. Some stuff, like why the people were reassambled in the past-history universe was unexplained(it was only quickly explained that they were actually reassembled from yet another universe, but that made no sense, also, why the old guy ended up in the middle of a desert, not the laboratory, was never revealed)"
2,"Movie script, not novel","I found it very hard to become absorbed in this book until the second half. It is written in a very choppy, episodic manner--as though the author was imagining the movie that will be made afterward. The characters are not very developed, and I kept mixing up their identities for awhile. Like a mindless Saturday night movie, however, the novel ultimately does entertain."
4,"Another Engaging, Well-Researched Read from Old Reliable","If you've enjoyed any of his prior works, and especially if you're intrigued by medieval times, you're likely to enjoy Chrichton's latest. It's inventive and acceptably, though not particularly well, paced.But what Chrichton did most notably in this novel is combine three elements - science fiction (time travel), ancient history (middle ages), and modern technology (quantum mechanics and quantum theory) - in a truly interesting way that had me thinking: While this couldn't possibly happen today, I can hold open the possibility that it might in twenty-five, fifty or a hundred years.In short, a very enjoyable and entertaining read."
4,Crichton Does Not Disappoint!,"Crichton's newest title has been a long time coming. I have been looking forward to this title ever since I heard it was going to be released. I just finished it and WOW! It does not disappoint! Crichton's heros are sent from the present to the past thru a ""quantum foam wormhole,"" and step out in feudal France circa 1357. The historians have been sent back to rescue one of their collegues who has become trapped in the past. And they need to rescue him in precisely 37 hours, or miss the trip back to 1999. This novel starts out very technical, but quickly switches to a ""swashbuckling tale"" with knights, damsels in distress, and much, much more! This was a quick read for me; I finished it in about a day and 1/2. The ending was predictable, but all in all, a good time!"
2,Defective Premise?,"Sorry, but I was distracted throughout my read by a gaping hole in the plot relating to the timing of their arrival in relation to the first person's arrival. True, there would have been no book if they had been directed to a more appropriate time to save their fellow travler; however, one wonders how this escaped the editors. While the plot had lots of action it was screenplay action contrived to reinvent Raiders of the Lost Ark where there is a problem at every turn. I enjoyed Crichton's other books more."
2,Disappointing,"This book is not as tight as some of Crichton's other accomplishments. The story was never very believable. There was suspense, but it was almost cliched. What he did do well was cause me to pause and reconsider what we really know about how people lived back in time."
1,Wait for the movie on basic cable,"My best guess is that Crichton knocked this movie treatment out over a weekend to meet a contract deadline. The science, especially the incredibly disappointing treatment of time paradoxes, is superficial - not just a lack of techincal depth but also none of the compelling conceptual exploration of Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, and even Rising Sun. Quantum computing, quantum foam and the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics become mere deus ex machina weaving together scenes of pointless gore.If technology gets abused, The Green Knight and the Black Death get better treatment from Monty Python.I could go on, but I expect the reader gets my drift. This is not a book but rather an off the cuff movie idea."
2,Screenplay,"When I read the book I thought Crichton was writing a made for tv movie. It lacks the depth of some of his prevoius novels, though it is a departure from his usual fare. I give it 2 stars."
5,Todd's Review on Timeline,"Timeline by Michael Crichton has been one of the best books I have ever read. It is full of action, war and scientific concepts. I love this book and recommend it to any of the people who are looking to buy it and read it. You will enjoy this book so much that you will want to read it over.Michael Crichton is one of the best authors around. He makes movie scripts, writes books, and writes screenplays. The book Timeline is also a movie rated pg13. I have not yet seen it but it looks good to me. Hopefully it will be as good as the book."
2,Please tell me Crichton didn't write this!,"Read ANY of Crichton's other books, including his mediocre collection of memoirs, ""Travels."" This book never gets off the ground as Sphere, Congo, or Jurassic Park did so quickly. The plot and writing style are so different from normal Crichton work that I continually checked the front cover to make sure that I had not picked up another book of the same title by a different author. If you read any of Crichton's other works and loved them, read them again and save yourself the money on this one. I only decided to give this book 2 stars because I feel the Crichton deserves more, not to mention the fact that I don't give 1-star reviews."
1,"Keep razor blade, gun, or large supply of barbituates handy","If you decide to read this book, you will need at least one of the afore mentioned items in your possession. How long you manage to last before needing to end your life depends on how tolerant you are of horrid, insulting storytelling."
3,Good but Disappointing,"This is not one of the author's best, but it still held my interest. Character development is very weak and at times the story becomes pretty uninvolving."
2,Like reading a bad Movie,"My least Favorite Cricton book (except maybe Congo). Too much roller-coaster action for Medieval France, much of it was uneeded and detracted from the story. I prefer a character-driven story. I enjoyed the events in Modern times much more than the past stuff. The science was interesting.I guess he envisioned Spielberg Directing this ""Movie"" in the manner of ""Back to the Future 2"" or ""Indiana Jones 2"". I see roles for Leonardo DiCapprio's and maybe Arnold. I was hoping to read a book."
1,Boo! Garbage!,"Crichton has a habit of producing books that are either superb or utter rubbish. Timeline, though it has a premise of incredible potential, is uninspired and disappointing; it may even surpass Lost World in terms of dull heroes and unacceptable plot. By unacceptable, I mean that the reader is never able to completely suspend their disbelief and accept the situations the paper-chain characters find themselves in. I was also sad to see Crichton contradict his eloquent explanations of time travel in Sphere - a book more enjoyable because the science was better explained and incorporated.If you had the power to go back in time, why go to France in the middle ages? Why not find out who really killed Kennedy and examine the life of Jesus, or bring back a dinosaur and start some sort of Jurassic park... oh, never mind."
3,Hopes Dashed,"In the beginning... I thought Mr. Crichton was back on track, writing a real novel after some past silliness of the Jurassic variety. The deserted desert opener is appropriately creepy, the history is fascinating, the physics piques my curiosity, the tech stuff is plausible and even the characters are believable. But then... disappointment sets in, page by page, as I realize this is just another movie script loosely disguised as a bestseller. The action scenes, the improbably slow passage of time with more happening in a half hour than could possibly happen, etc. and yet, I read on to the end, turning pages, curious about the outcome, glad on the whole that Crichton takes the trouble to entertain us in any format. I'll recommend it, but with a mild warning about the need to suspend one's disbelief."
4,A delicious adventure,"I look to Michael Crichton books for what they are: fun, light, summertime reading. ""Timeline"" is immensely enjoyable. The old, standard formula is there, but that is why I buy these books and what makes the ride such a treat. Also: Kudos to Crichton for easing into his story a reference to the obscure but fascinating medieval text ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight."" Pleasurable indeed!"
3,MC Writing Screenplays Now?,"I am an engineer and I love the deep detail that Crichton goes into in his techno-thrillers.Timeline is much simpler and straight-forward than the Crichton novels I have read (that being almost all of them). Having just read the reviews for Prey, it seems that MC is trying to make it much simpler to adapt his books for the silver screen.I read books to get the rich detail that you can't get from movies. This book lacks that detail. While Timeline is a good book that I enjoyed reading, it doesn't measure up to Crichton's other excellent novels."
3,From bad to OK,"The first one hundred pages of this book are some of the most boring ever put on paper. But, if you can get through the muddle of Chricton trying to describe Quantum Theory in kid-like terms, then the book really picks up. The second half is classic Chricton."
4,A great read!,"This is one of those books that you will have trouble putting down - a creative and unusual story. Say what you might about the book written with a movie script in mind (so what - I will see the movie too) or some of the predictable and cardboard characters, this is a wonderful read. Crichton can sure tell a story and keep it moving cutting back and forth with three or more threads to keep you from putting the book down. Most of the people I know who read this zipped through it in a couple of days. I did not want it to end. That's another thing - a great ending...you'll want to think about it.A lot of fun and you will learn something about life in 14th cc France as Crichton seems to have done his homework (with a bibliography, no less). As a result, I am going to read more about the ""High Middle Ages"". Perfect book for a technology/sci-fi and history buff."
2,Timeline: Too Much,"Michael Crichton writes, I read. But this one was a frustrated effort. The action is perfect for a film. However, the main characters were - at every turn - losing each other. It was too much, too often. It will make a great action film, but in text was frustrating to read. I kept thinking, ""Good GRIEF, not again!"" I finished the book ONLY because I am compulsive, if not, I would have put it down halfway through."
3,An OK book by a great author,"Simply not up to Crichton's normal, groundbreaking efforts. A great idea for a story and well written - but I did feel it was too similar to Jurassic Park in concept. A good read but wish I'd waited for the paperback edition. I'm currently enjoying his ""Travels"" trade paperback."
2,Nearly Unreadable,This is not a great book. The science and the history are speculative; the characters are wooden and undeveloped; and too often the story depends on fortunate circumstance to keep it alive. The amount of blood and gore tells us Chricton has spent too much time in the ER.Timeline reads as if it were writen by a committee. Clearly Crichton has a lot on his plate; perhaps too much if this is the result.
5,Don't listen to the other low-rate bozos who gave this <5,"Michael Crichton truly delivers in Timeline. Meshing past, present, and future perfectly. The storyline and the whole angle at which he approaches the novel is truly unique. Action is spectacular, and above all, it is a amazingly interesting read. Buy it today, especially if you like Physics or history.I started to read this for Physics extra credit. I was truly surprised when I found that it was an extremely good novel, and now The Pelican Brief by Grisham -- which I am reading simultaneously -- is fighting for the top spot."
3,A Fast Read,"This was a pretty good book. I took it on vacation. I read it in four days. The story is easy to follow... The idea of how time travel is executed in this book is very interesting if a little implausible. I don't know very much about the year 1350 or there abouts, but the book did seem to be authentic. The scenes that were protrayed were close enough for me.If you're looking for something with not too much depth, this is a good book."
2,Missing Pages!,"I think I would have been able to enjoy this book more had I been able to read it straight through, instead of having to look for missing pages! My pages 275-306 were duplicated from other pages in the book. To my dismay, the missing pages were nowhere to be found. What kind of publishing goof-up do you call this!"
3,"Good but not the usual ""crichton good""","I really expected a LOT more from crichton. His usual combination of science and adventure can be found in this book and makes it very compelling and a (VERY) fast read. The problem with this book is that the storyline is not believable. For instance, if the story is not about time travel, how come things done in the past have an affect on the present? There are many gaps in the story, not something usually seen in crichton books. I was a little disappointed."
2,Wait for the movie,"I was pretty excited when I picked this book up, but man was it tough NOT to put it down. after the first third of the book, which is pretty good, the entire story just falls apart. There was so much goofy action and so little real plot that I have to belive this was written with the sole intent of making it into a movie. I felt cheated."
4,Timeline,"I have read all Michael Crichton's works and find him a very diverse author, as this book demonstrates. The historical perspective brings the book alive. It was difficult wading through the ""quantum"" theories at the beginning of the book, but smooth sailing past that. A really enjoyable read and I'll bet the movie will be a block buster."
1,Has no one noticed Crichton isn't writing books anymore?,"The only thing missing from Crichton's last two books, and glaringly apparent in Timeline, are stage directions. He's not writing books, he's writing movie treatments. The first part of the book does get ones hopes up, but as soon as the mystery which opens the book is solved, it quickly disolves into chaotic chases, cardboard characters, and a tacked on ending. Why bother to continue to write run-of-mill stuff like this, Mr. Crichton should just stick to script writing."
1,Timeline for retirement...,"Timeline is the third disappointing novel in a row from Crichton. There was simply no suspense in the novel at all. Scientific facts and conjecture can only do so much when unaccompanied by at least some tension. Every sword sparks, every horse sighs, winnies or snorts and everybody escapes huge knights in the knick of time...It was a chore to finish, skip the book, skip the movie..."
5,Timeline is Riveting Experience!,Michael Crichton will take you to the medieval past with emerging quantum technology. You will experience chivalry and barbarity of the medieval era. The science is believable and the discription of the journey to the past is vivid. Timeline is a riveting experience!Timeline the movie would only be icing on the cake.
4,An engaging page-turner.,"Having read most of Crichton's books, I'm under no illusion that he's a great writer....he's not even close to that. What he does better than most is to 'push the envelope' and explore issues that are usually at the exotic fringe of society, but not mainstream. Thus I was not disappointed with Timeline...I found it quite engaging. There were some serious lapses in logic, but most of Crichton's books are like that. For light, quick reading this book is a winner. The movie that follows will surely rake in millions. He knows what he's doing."
3,"Good, but not really all that good","I enjoyed the book for awhile, then it started to get rather boring. I got rather tired of one (or more) of the characters suddenly getting into trouble, only to have another character suddenly appear out of nowhere to come to the rescue, especially when the trouble spot didn't have any bearing on the story, but rather added a page or two to the book. There are many examples of this, but I will not show one as I don't wish to give something away to future readers. Michael Crichton was a new author for me to read. Based on reputation, I was looking forward to it. I'm not really sure I will read another of his books or not."
1,Disappointed again......and for the last time!,"When I read Sphere, Crichton instantly became my favorite writer. After that sequel to Jurassic Park (whatever it was called), I became dissappointed in Crichton's obvious sell out. Why did he quickly come out with ""Jurassic Park warmed over"", basically the same book, with basically the same dinosaurs and characters, but stirred up in a shallower pot, so that the leftovers are full of meaningless action, easily transferable to visual media ... an embarassingly obvious movie script excuse for a book. Now he's dared do it again. IMHO, his once brilliant writing now just smells of opportunism."
2,"Michael, what happened?","Mr Crichton is one of my very favorite authors and so i will forgive him this one. Initially i thought i was digging into yet another of his brilliant visions, but alas, it was not to be. Perhaps he was distracted. Even the scientific premise was fatally flawed. Messages planted in a parallel universe would show up only in THAT future, not ours. Ah well, no one's perfect.. and at least now i have an idea of what quantum theory is about."
3,Just okay.,"Our neighborhood book club chose this as its March selection and rated it at 3 to 3.5. We too observed that it appeared to have been written as the precurser to a screenplay. Members of the group commented that the chase episodes became old after about the first two -- a plot device perhaps overused. Others likened the plot to ""Time and Again"" by Jack Finney; the project leader's name in that book was Danziger ... and a character made a choice similar to one in Crichton's book. We found the science interesting to contemplate, but not being physicists cannot comment on its accuracy. Definitely was an interesting look into the Middle Ages."
4,"Don't be fooled by the lousy movie, this book is good","This is a very good book, long before it became a movie. It's too bad that lame casting, adaptation, and apparently promoting the movie as a teenfest sullied the book's reputation.In any event, the book is well done time-travel. There's good pacing that keeps the pages turning, fun characters, and a good setting."
1,A great premise...and not much else.,"Very disappointing. A promising idea but... shallow characters, far too many predictable close calls/narrow escapes without tension, and loose threads, made this a big yawn. About 1/3 of the way through, I started to skip-read to get through the drivel. Some early potential plot directions were later abruptly dismissed in a couple of sentences for no apparent reason. It feels like Mr. Crichton wrote this on a single plane trip (N.Y. to L.A.?). Perhaps on his way to sell the movie rights?"
1,Waste of time,"I feel cheated. The first part of the book (till the time voyage) is somewhat interesting. After that, it is a boring and predictable adventure plot."
1,kept turning pages looking for better writing,"Was very disappointed in TimeLine....book needed editing, first 150 pages could have been cut by half and all the 'saids' removed to save a tree.Characters were flat and a reader couldn't really care about them; or feel the suspense.TV's Sliders was more thrilling!"
3,Entertaining,"I have read a number of Crichton books, from his early novels to the most recent. After a string of books that I thought were dissappointing and actering more to Hollywood, 'Timeline' was better. Crichton's explaination of the history, the locations, and the peroid were great. The plot was fast paced and once I was hooked the book was hard to put down.The science behind time travel was a little weak. Having read books on quantum physics (I am far from knowledgable)I understood Crichton's concept of alternative universes. However, I couldn't buy Crichton's handling of the time travel paradox and if the characters were in the past.These are minor points. They raised some questions for me, but the story was non the less very good. Even though a movie has been made of this book I didn't get the feeling that the plot was laid out for a script.Enjoy!"
3,2 stars for science and 5 stars for history,"Since I read this first about 2000, I have read several other at nearly the same historical periodThe Potter's Field: The Seventeenth Chronicle of Brother Cadfael/The Pillars of the Earthand a lot more about quantum computers andquantum gravity. The sci fi is more like fantasy than science,but the history is pretty good.The characterization of the executive seems to be a send up of Steve Jobs of Apple and his ""style"".I found it an enjoyable read both times.His history was better than the other historical novel he wrote.Eaters of the Dead"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Getting medieval on me is no fun.A breakthrough research project goes badly wrong when someone uses it for their own ends, and ends up back in time with future knowledge, and the person that tries to stop him likewise, but in trouble.The scientist and his students who are working on the project have to work out a way to put things right while surviving in a brutal and dagnerous past era without the requisite skills and knowledge.Some of this ok, but overall a fairly mediocre book."
5,"Action packed, very good read!",I read the first half of this book while delayed in the airport. I was pulled in by the very first page and the non-stop action kept me going until the very end. Great beach book!!
1,"Superb screenplay, but a book ....","You can see the book was written for Hollywood. Very promising start. The end fizzles out like a wet squib. Totally impossible situations with little or no characterizations. Very flat characters. There is no effort to bring the intrigue, ignorance and the changing Middle Ages to life - it serves merely as a background for phenomenal chases and stunts."
3,Timeline- Honestly speaking,"Several of the reviews I read before I ordered this book warned me about it`s shortcomings but the story line sounded good si i figured i would enjoy it anyway. Well i did, but they were right. It was a bit thin in parts and reads a lot like one of those books that comes out after the movie does. The story line is great and has a lot of merit,but it could have been a whole lot better with a bit more character development and some more time invested in background details by the author. A lot of the book only gives just enogh information so you move into the next chapter as quickly as possible. Do authors get paid by the book or the word? In this case it must have been the latter. If you like sword fights, medieval battles , castles, devious but endearing damsels and time travel on top of all of that - it`s still a good read if you can overlook the rest and have an active imagination to fill in the blanks!"
1,You've got a time machine and a movie camera....,...and the first place you send it is to record the Gettysburg Address?Wouldn't the first place you'd send it be to watch the Red Sea part (or not)? Or to watch Jesus walk on water (or not)? Or to see who killed JFK?The whole book is filled with stuff like this that just doesn't make any sense. You will be infuriated by it.
5,More quantum foam please,"I am going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviewers and rate this book 5 stars. I loved it! I have enjoyed most of Crichton's novels and they are all similar in some way. I love his writing style and this book is a great example of when Crichton writes well. I am kind of a geek and I liked all the quantum foam, time machine jargon. Read it and enjoy it because it your classic time machine story with a new twist."
3,For the poolside,"I liked it. The plot is fast, and it kept me turning the pages. For the lovers of true medieval history, try more erudite, academic books (e.g., Barbara Tuchman's A Distant Mirror), but for those with a hard-to-capture attention span, this is a fun read for the summer. Take with you to the pool; take it with you to lazy summer picnic, but don't take it with you to the stodgy history professor. Crichton has good imagination, and the book combines a healthy dose of sci-fic wistfulness with passable historical reconstruction. As a graduated history major from Yale, I have absolutely no objection to such fictional history telling."
1,TIMELINE REVIEW,Based on the Jacket review I expected this to be an entertaining story. What a disapointment!There has to be some logic and rational to the sequence of events in a good story. This story ignors these elementary requirements. The story was confused and bewildering. I did finish the book hoping that there was somthing worth while to be discovered. Nothing came of my effort.I stongly suggest that the author and publisher of this travesty do not rely on past performanmce to justify inflicting the public with such trash.
3,A glaring inconsistency,"I was up to page 250 or so of this work and hit what seems to be a glaring inconsistency in the plot line. I'm talking about the passage where Marek, it seemed, had convinced Sir Oliver to let him fight as Chris's champion in the challenge joust Sir Guy and then Guy's champion, since Chris knew nothing about jousting. Sir Olver says ""Let it be so."" But, in the next segment or scene, Chris has to fight first. What the hell is going on with the plot!!? I'm finding it almost impossible to go on with such a glaring error blocking my path."
1,Amatuer Writing,"This book, which has a very interesting story line, is among the worst written books I have ever read. It is repetitious and takes forever to get to the end that everyone knows will occur."
2,Me fail English? That's unpossible!,"To put it simply, in an attempt to avoid useless rambling; like many of Crichton's other books, 'Timeline' is an amazing story idea but, since Crichton is an overall bad* author, the book fails to remain interesting** beyond the summary.* because of his terrible paragraph structure, unbalanced and ineffective combination of history lessons and the story, repetitive use of adjectives, laughable attempt at drama, and angering use of those damnable 2-dot section breaks ESPECIALLY when no break is neccessary.** even with all those repetitive and unimaginative plot twists."
1,Long tedious comic book,"Rarely have I read a sillier, shallower book.The writing style is roughly 12th grade, the history-science clumsily interjected, the characters straight out of Batman Comics, and the ending utterly predictable. Crichton must write this stuff in his sleep dreaming all the while of the many dollars he will make selling this to the movies for which it was obviously written. It is disheartening to be confronted with what is known as a ""best-seller"" for it reveals the reading tastes and abilities of the average reader.And, NO, I didn't finish it. Why waste the time when the ending was apparent from page 20. Bah humbug to you MC and your appallingly badly written books."
3,Timeline is intriguing but just doesn't flow,"Michael Chrichton has written an excellent novel, well thought out and gripping. However, I found some of the passages to be slow and heavy. In addition, I found the switching bewteen time periods a bit strained and contrived. One author who has mastered this technique is Ann Benson, author of the Plague Tales and the Burning Road. If you liked Timeline, I would highly recommend both of these books; Benson does an excellent job of tackling two tales in one book. Timeline is an interesting and intriguing book, but would benefit from a more flowing style and better editing."
3,Time For An Action Novel? Then TIMELINE Is For You,"Michael Crichton's recent midieval novel, TIMELINE, proved to be a far more interesting and engaging story than I had expected from reading the inside cover. Crichton has cleverly mixed modern quantom theory with a little imagination and a lot of interesting facts from a time and place most of us know little about and produced an action thriller I found I could not put down!While the ending was somewhat predictable and the motivation for the story to occur in the first place was somewhat questionable you will quickly find yourself caught up and carried along by this clever story of modern man meeting some rather tough folks from a long time ago.Treatr yourself to some enjoyable, recreational reading and go for TIMELINE."
5,Timeline the Tapes,"I thoughly enjoyed this book. He did a good job developing his characters and using them in what I felt were fairly realistic situations. I think all the ""nay sayers"" should stick to their Text books, because they are obviously not reading books to be entertained. I listened to the unabriged version and I can see where it may be heading toward the big screen, but that ""is"" an indication of a good book. I want to praise John Bedford Llyod for bringing this story to life. I do a fair amount of driving and to help pass the time I listen to audio tapes of books I do not have time to read. I recommend everybody try one on their next long trip. Give these tapes or the book a try and remember it's a book, be entertained not jaded."
1,Timeline,"It should be titled waste of Timeline!Ok, yes it is easy to be a critic but, I can't beleive that I read the whole thing.He must have gotten tired of writing and decided to just end it. The ending was horrid. There were pages of where it might get going but, no. I only wish I had not wasted my time on it.Oh and the plot line of evil capitalist against do good academics is so droll. Save your money and your time and buy something else, you will be glad you did!"
5,The movie robbed MC readers of a REALLY GREAT BOOK!!!,"Turn off the VCR, put down the remote now run out and buy the book!!! The book has more characters that didn't crossover into the movie and robs you of a great story. It's a must read and will keep you engrossed. Call the office, phone in sick...Read this book!!! Michael Crichton Rules!!!"
5,His BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Jurassic Park, Sphere, and the Lost World are all My favorite books. I have read not only those but Congo, and Im in the middle of The Andromeda Strain. I am 11! If I can read and understand these it means they are all excellent! A Must Read Book His Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,More Intelligent Than the First Book,"Though the loose screen adaptation of this novel had entertainment value, it was a basically (and unfortunately) a dumbed-down version of what turns out to be a remarkable book that is superior to Jurassic Park (the book). I found the science in this book much more interesting than the action, there is one scene that is absolutely terrifying involving the boy and the velociraptors, that was certainly never considered for the movie adaptation because it was just too damned disturbing. My viewpoint by the way...these are the only two Crichton Books I have ever read."
3,First one was twice as good,"The first book was good enough to stand on it's own and didn't need a sequel. This book was somewhat exciting but after I was done with it I didn't feel as satisfied as I did after I read the first one. Actually the book probably deserves 3 1/2 stars but there isn't something allocated for that. It is a good rainy day book, but there are a lot of better rainy day books out there. To me it just seems like Crichton can't put 2 great books out in a row. Of course that is just my opnion, I could be wrong."
4,The Lost World - The Dinosaur Tale,"Packed to the brim with action, suspense, and drama The Lost World by Michael Crichton is a novel that will be read for generations to come. Doctor Ivan Malcom just gets back from a terror theme park (Jurassic park) and he is off again to a dinosaur filled island to save his work college Levine. The islands name Site B. Once on the island he encounters gentle giants such as the triceratops, brontosaurus and the stegosaurus along with the fearsome raptor, carnotaurus sastrei, and Tyrannosaurus. He observes them from a supposedly safe place The High Hide before disaster strikes and a fearsome T-Rex destroys all lab equipment. To make matters worse all forms of transportation off the island are gone and nobody knows they are there. Will they survive? This book is an excellent example of courage, nobility and most of all companionship. This book is my all time favorite and should be treated like royalty."
4,hard to find,I was happy to find this book because my son really wanted it. it came quickly and was in very good shape.
1,Marketing Gimickery Hits New Low,"This rehashed Jurassic Park clone is indeed a trite, banal,witless, juvenile, egregious piece of garbage that willcertainly be the LAST Crichton novel I ever read. Crichtonmanages a much poorer work than even the worst of his rip-offs. In this movie-treatment-playing-novel Crichtonproves himself as one of the still-existing dinosaurs thatstill roam this earth. I weep for the hours I wasted onthis trash."
2,"Sequel to Crichtons Jurasic Park, Dinos on the Rampage again","I didn't like this book very much.Why:Well because of a number of reasons.First of all the book is a rehap of the movie Jurasic Park.The cute kids have absolutely no function in the story, and should be left out.The fact that dinos act differently than in JP.ETC"
2,Avoid if you have read Jurrasic Park or can go to the cinema,"This book is a complete rehash of Crichton's former dino-book, Jurassic Park. As in that book, we have herethe (very) same ingridients: A reculse Doctor, A female Doctor, 2 adorable, smart kids, some people looking into making money, oh and let's not forget, an island full of rampaging Dinos. The end of the book can be seenclearly from it's first page. And while in his former book Crichton at least gave us food for thougt (Chaos theory, Environment etc...) you wont find them here. This book clearly suffers from Sequelittis. Avoid if possible. If you want Dino action - see the movie"
2,"ooops! i only hope ""Airframe"" will be better...","That was one major disappointment. it's a screenplay, and aboutas interesting and surprising as the one of the movie ""IndependenceDay"". I guess you could skip every second page without missing anything of importance. if you've never read one of Crichton's books before, you might find this one to be sort of ok - otherwise it's just a simple and cheap piece of making even more money."
2,Arrgh - I detect an advanced case of sequelitis.,"This little exercise had all the bad traits of sequels and none of the few benefits. As with many sequels the author round up essentially the same cast (some JP characters, precocious children, evil corporate baddies), cooked up a reason to put the dinosaurs back in, and viola. No effort seems to have been spent on expanding what we already knew about the JP world. Crichton and the publishers simply wanted to feed readers another dose of JP while they were still digesting the first story. The accompanying movie feels as if the camera were just left running at the end of the first movie and that alone would be enough to keep viewers. Not this one."
1,Absolutely horrible,No new ideas. Desecrating the memory of Jurassic Park. Avoid this book -- it's an unfortunate waste of time and money. Try Jurassic Park or Disclosure instead.
2,"Okay plot, cool, most of all, entertaining.","The book held my interest, but I just don't think Malcom would do that without more help. As if he's just gonna march right to the site. He knows the dangers. But he still goes. If you're looking for something just to keep you busy, this'll work"
3,Good Follow Up to Jurassic Park,"With 'The Lost World', Crichton has continued his story of genetically engineered dinosaurs. This time on an overlooked island related to the first story. The story is similar to the first novel, but it's still a good read. Crichton adds his usual mix of technology and adventure.If you saw the movie, but hated Spielberg's Godzilla-like ending, read the book. It ends differently. If you're a Crichton fan, or a Jurassic Park fan, you should definitely read this."
4,Very good book horrible movie,"Mike does a splendid job of detail in this amazing book. This book provides detail about the dinosuars and how they would live and respond to humans. I admit I did skip a few pages when the book describes about dinosuars interacting with one another. But it still provided an increadible reading experience. This book has lead to many new games and a few spin offs, most are not appealing at all. I hope to read the book as soon as I can. The movie is a completly different story, don't waste your time or money on somthing Speilberg could obviously have done better."
5,exelent book read it twice and it was still exciting,exelent better than movie other than that the summery covers itblake griffin
3,A Trip to where the dinosaurs still roamed the Earth,"The Lost World utilizes excellent imagery and has a phenomenal setting. In this book some kids are in school and they were supposed to go on a field trip. Then that day, a sub walks in and they find out that their teacher is missing. Only they know that he is hunting dinosaurs. Then they know of a professor that is going to go look for their teacher....without them. They decide to sneak into a container and go along to some remote island where there are dinosaurs. On this island they are able to locate their teacher, but they do run into some very interesting difficulties. This thriller novel is one amazing book if you can just use your imagination."
5,Crichton hits another trilling high-point w/ The Lost World!,"Character development is something Crichton is acclaimed for,and this zing ride of a novel is no exception. The jumpsback and forth from the states and the island are arrangedin perfect continuity with each other. Another thing is theskillful use of new dinosaurs in the story. Many times Ifelt a chill wriggle itself down my spine at the books mostintense moments of suspense. The reach and depth far exceedsthat of the original Jurassic Park. Dr. Ian Malcolm's returnis a welcomed presence. Pick up this Crichton instant classicup before it takes a bite out of you!!"
3,Not One of the best,This book is definatly not one of the best I have ever read. It was somewhat dry and didn't get straight to the point. I would recommend reading Jurassic Park before this one.
2,Unimaginative reprise of the first book,"There's so much Crigton could have done, raptors escaping to main land, world reaction, etc ... All he could come up with his sequel is very similar scenario constrained again within an island and complete with new kids. No new science is revealed and it feels like a quick work meant primarily for the big screen. It's interesting that Spielberg rejected most of the scenes or invented his own in his Lost World film. It is still a Crighton very easy read but I felt that I wasted my time afterward. Get the first book instead."
1,Disappointing!,It felt like a cheap sequel movie to Jurassic Park. There is nothing new in it! Don't bother buying it
4,Another success for Crichton!,"They went back to the island...An extremely entertaining book. It wasn't quite as intenseas some of Crichton's other books, so I thought...Then about 1/2 way through I was turning pages as fast asI could.You won't be disappointed."
1,Obviously a screenplay,"What a disappointment! JURRASIC PARK was much scarier and better written. This is obviously meant to be a screenplay, complete with the cute, precocious stowaway kids. As I was reading it, I could visualize how Speilburg would set up the scenes. Forget the book and see the movie. If you want to read a good book about dinosaurs other than JP, read RAPTOR RED by Robert Bakker"
1,Obviously written with filmmaking in mind.,"This is perhaps one of the most boring books I have ever read.""Lost World"" reads as though he was contacted by Speilbergand asked to whip something up on which to base the sequel to the movie. Pages of Malcoms boring theories are followed by lame, predictable action sequences. I sure am glad I checked this out from the library and did not purchase it. Don't waste your time."
