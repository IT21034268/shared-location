2,Not what I expected,"Don't make the mistake I did and think this is a step by step workbook with guidelines. It is simply blank watercolor pages for you to paint on. The instructions are in ANOTHER book, Wilcox's first book about color mixing. You can spend a bundle of money getting all you need to experiment with his color mixing technique."
1,Great for masonry,"After planting a peace lily in this soil I noticed a a complete lack of growth, it actually started dying. With no other options I pulled it out of the pot to be met with a mixture of clay and sand that could only be described as brick-like with a few twigs embedded in it. After breaking off the soil-like substance with a hammer I re-planted it with a different potting soil and had much better results. Stay away."
1,Worse than Dirt,"I'm reviewing dirt, here, let's keep in mind. And it's because the stuff is so bad, you'd do better to get dirt from a concrete island separating a 4-lane road than to purchase this product. The bags I bought were ~$5 at a local hardware store, so the price here is 2X that. Second, it is full of chunks of clay, wood, ROCKS -- several really large rocks were in the bags, that's how they get to 8 lbs... But the main problem is that I've never had success growing vegetables using Hyponex potting soil. I've had stellar success with enhanced/composted dirt from outside and from other potting soils. But vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers and even peppers don't do well) consistently fail with Hyponex, so think about that before you invest in a porch garden with Hyponex! It's on my boycott list for life."
4,Beautiful movie!!,"This movie is one that is very touching! Daniela Lujan (Luz Clarita) stars as an angel, who is looking for God. She does not understand why God is not in Heaven and she keeps on looking for him. She sings a few songs, and is just so very delightful. The movie is in spanish but there are optional english subtitles, which are truly subtitles that say exactly what is being said in spanish. This DVD also has a 35 minute behind the scenes special which is quite interesting and optional subtitles also for this. You will enjoy this movie very much!"
3,good little lamp with a few issues,"I purchased this lamp to be a reading lamp for bed. Overall, I am not disappointed. The LEDs are not the super bright variety, but it puts off enough light by which to read.My one real complaint is that the goose neck is not strong enough to support its own weight. Either slowly over time or in sudden, jerky motions, the lamp ""falls"". this is not catastrophic and it can be overcome with a little twisting, but it is inconvenient, which is why I did not give the lamp 4 stars.Overall, this is a good reading lamp and I will continue using it until the next great thing comes along."
1,Why bother,"I should have put more stock in the reviews already available. I thought, of course a gooseneck lamp will stay in position! It does not. It turns out not to matter, because the multiple LEDs give out as much illumination as a flashlight that is about to burn out. The best thing about it is that Amazon makes it easy to return."
5,Amazingly beautiful!,"The cards are not only a pleasure to look at, but allow deep insights into my personality and my unconscious. I have never seen such a beautiful - and practical - tarot deck. Thanks to the creator James Wanless."
5,little people love Little People!,"My daughter loved watching this video when she was little, and now my son (age 3) watches a LP video every day.When this one got stepped on accidentally and wouldn't play anymore, my son begged me to get a new one, so I just HAD to replace it! He was so excited when it came in the mail.We have volulmes 1-4, and each one has great stories that teach life lessons too. I'm not sure how my son can watch them over and over again, but he does and continues to love them! I'm sure our third child will get much use out of them too."
5,Ahh...How About Awesome!,"How these two Scotsmen escaped deity status I will never know. Their talent is overwhelming. More intelligent, introspective, self-empowering, self-effacing, humerous tunes do not exist-period. This CD has harmonies (and lyrics) that will break your heart.Their geeky persona's are clearly a put-on, every tune radiates the confidence of proud men who clearly have mastered their craft. Above all else, this CD rocks harder than the Indigo Girls on Scottish Whiskey. I have since purchased their two preceeding CD's and have only rave commentary for ""The Proclaimers"" (check out ""This is the Story"" for an acoustic masterpiece). If you buy one CD this year, make it a ""Proclaimers"" CD-any one. They truly stand alone."
4,Great traveling blanket!,"Light weight, yet very tough. Easy to use and versatile. Great value for the price. I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,don't like it. it folds very awkwardly,we got one after reading the reviews. but we don't really like it since it doesn't fold well.
3,kind of too big for my purpose,"3-in-1 doesn't do any one great. I carry this on my touring bike to go camping with. It is pretty comfortable to lay this on my therma-rest under my sleeping bag. But for that purpose it doesn't really need to be this big. When I first opened it I tried out the poncho and can't imagine using it as a poncho in real life. So it is a blanket, a poncho, and I can't even remember the third use anymore. I'll use it for now, but when it wears out I'll try something else."
5,"Fantastic combo piece for outdoor use (camping, concerts, outings)","Bought this blanket/poncho/stadium seat/pillow & couldn't be happier! Looked for a versatile item that the family could use camping, football games, etc. Very well made (as most Coleman items are) haven't washed it yet....but will probably follow another reviewers advice and not dry it in the dryer. Contrary to other reviews, it's very easily converted back into pouch (pillow) form.My ONLY complaint is that you can't choose a color.I'm looking forward to it raining next time I camp.....I think <<wink>>BUY ONE BEFORE COLEMAN STOPS MAKING THEM! $17 is a steal!"
4,Courageous woman finds her equal,"Chastity, after being ruined by her father, is bound to see her sister marry the man she loves. Enter Lord Cyn, who sees through her masquarade and still wants to help. A GREAT READ"
1,TERRIBLE!,This product is terrible. I bought it for someone as a birthday gift and it broke in its first use. Very disapointed!!!
5,way too much fun,"I purchased these for christmas for family and friends for gift bags. what a riot to play with. my aunt's cat fetches the cow from wherever it lands. my 3 year old loves the duck. she has figured out how to maneuver the sling shot and aiming at dad and her older sister is her favorite thing to do. she giggles the whole time. when she tires of shooting it she brings it to us and says quick i'll run and you get me. for the price they have been well worth it. the cow and frog are a little harder to get your fingers into to make them work. better for smaller hands. soft, so it doesn't hurt if you actually get hit with one."
3,I loved the Piggy,If once there was a cat named felix who frowned upon the rising moon pie. The elasticity of this blade of grass exceeded my expectations beyond the dragon zombies and I took a screen shot of the anal sepage juice.
2,Simpatico,"The projects were on this side of cheesy. I was looking for some that didn't have that 1950's Home Handyman look. But the real disapointment that there was no resource list, particularly a list of suppliers. But I find that is de rigueur with British publications (author's residence on the inside front page is England and I've noted that English books are notorious for not providing good resource lists that we Americans demand)."
4,It fits...,"That's all there is to say about it, it fits, it filters fine. In other words it does its job."
3,Not exactly what I thought I ordered,"There are two filters for this water treatment system. I thought I was getting the bigger one for a good price. Instead I got the smaller one for an average price. Oh well, buyer be aware."
2,Buyer beware,"Though it seems like a great deal if you do not investigate, the description does not give the specs on the filter. This is a big problem because you are not able to effectively compare it to the actual Amway filter. The REAL E85 Amway filter will filter out particles down to 0.2 microns in size, filters 1,250 gallons of water, and removes more than 140 contaminants.You need to ask yourself: will this filter do the same thing? I tried a while back to get more information from a company selling this A101 filter. They didn't have the specs on hand and they couldn't contact anyone for further info. Very questionable at the very least. I passed on this one."
2,Vocals not the Biggest problem!,"I've been a Wet Willie fan since I saw them in Memphis back in the late 70's. I've just listened to the clips of this CD and while I grant that the vocals fall far short of Jimmy Hall's, they are not the biggest problem by a long shot. The guitar tone is so thin and trebly it sounds like he's plugged into a transistor radio with a blown 2 inch speaker and turned it up full blast! This may be the worst sounding live electric guitar tone I've ever heard and I've heard a lot. What the heck's going on here. Are the sound engineer's eardrums busted from years of mixing rock n roll?"
2,Not too functional,"Wish I'd paid more attention to the reviewer who warned that the bottle opening was too small to fit an ice cube in it, as I don't usually have time to chill my water . I've had it 2 mos and the vinyl covering is already peeling off-- this may bother some. I'm not sure if aluminum is the most ideal material anyway for a bottle --wasn't there some controversy with aluminum a few years ago? The instructions do warn not to use with acidic liquids.Suggest you investigate stainless w/ a wider opening."
1,Stay away from any Sigg product,"We got two Sigg bottles and one started to leak. Customer service for Sigg was rude, accusatory and impossible to deal with. They blamed me for dropping it, putting it in the freezer, or anything they could think of. The truth is, that it is an inferior product. We returned it after much hassle and bought Greenfeet bottles instead, which are much better overall. My suggestion, stay away from all Sigg products, they really stink and are overpriced. Greenfeet offers a much better and sturdier product."
1,The new 'EcoLiner' liners in these bottles will peel off!!!,"The new 'EcoLiner' liners in these bottles will peel off!!! At first I thought I had a piece of debris, hair or something in my bottle, then I realized it was from the bottle itself. I tugged at it a little and the yellowish liner of the bottle peeled right out of the threads. The chance of ingesting this peeling is very good. Worse for you than a little BPA, I'm guessing... Don't buy a Sigg!!"
1,Sport Top NOT Included,"I ordered ""Rise Above Plastic,"" and it did NOT come with a sport top, although the name and description of this item clearly state that the sport top is included. Return forms, emails and a phone call resulted in Amazon shipping me two replacements that also did not have a sport top. And apparently it is impossible for Amazon to send me a sport top which it sells separately. Amazon FAIL!"
3,Lovely bottle-too many restrictions,"I bought this bottle as a safe and attractive alternative to plastic. I was surprised by all the ""don'ts"". As for the do not use boiling water or freeze-that makes sense but the ""only use ready to drink"" item got to me. I use a lot of individual Crystal Light type mixes and I cannot use them in this bottle. Very pricey for what it can deliver."
4,I don't regret it but...,"I bought the Samurai Spirit design bottle, and if you look closely at the supplied picture, there are two supplementary designs printed on the bottle that cannot be made out. These are matching, palpable (a rough feeling) tattoo=style designs of a tiger and dragon fighting. Considering these designs are both more noticably colored and equally prominent on the bottle, it surprises me that a picture that shows them is not included here on the website. Also, my bottle had a scuff/indent about the size of a nickel. Normally damaged product would be enough to ask for a replacement, but I am clummsy and will scuff it myself in time.Thhe sigg bottle is very cool, very light and sturdy feeling, there is no tinny taste to water drunk fom it. I'm happy with it."
5,Do Yo Want To Make a Whole Lot of Money?,I can't tell you how many times I have referred to this book for my investment descisions. It's an accurate and clear portrayal of what goes on in the global market. My returns are increasing more and more everyday!
5,"This book is an ""event"" in itself.","I am not an avid reader. Yet, once I started reading this book, I couldn't stop. I found that the author, with his first hand knowledge of medical terms, was able to make me feel as though I was apart of everything happening. This book should be on everyones ""must read"" list."
2,A good source book on the subject.,"The author clearly makes a valiant effort at understanding the country. While he impresses with the scope of literature survey on the issue, Cohen fails to produce a thesis of any remark, or even coherence, from that wide reading. A great book if (1) you want to use it as a source book or (2)want to know what stereotypes have plagued America's understanding of India, for the author regurgitates a lot of such stereotypes. The book makes notable departures from mediocrity, as when it discusses Nehruvian antecedents to Indias present policy, but is on the whole uninspired. If the book is any barometer of USA's views on India, the future of the US-India alliance is not very bright."
5,Good recognition to a sleeping super power,"After reading this book, it is certain that author is not a newabout India and has knowledge of every aspects of indian attitudeand why it is poised to become to become a power to reckon with.India has not only succeded in providing the world best technology savvy people but also a ground where ideal thoughts have been originated such as Hinduism, Budhism, Sikhism and Jainism. Not only that india is a land of respect for all religion and various possible thoughts that a human being can have. Certainly world has to know about India through this book."
1,The book takes you nowhere.,I believe the author needs to ask a question to himself -What is the objective of this book ? Because the author takes you nowhere. I was more than frustrated after reading the first 4 chapters.There was a story in a leading Pakistani Daily in 1999 that a lot of money was funneled into US based think-tanks by Pakistany authorities in 1998-99 in order to publish material that speaks for Pakistan by targetting India. I believe this book is a product of that effort.This book actually fails to address the core issue and gives you the impression that the author had no objective in his mind when he wrote this book.Please do NOT read this book ? Let alone buying it.
2,INSTRUMENTAL PLAYING MARRED BY POOR SINGING,"The enjoyment of instrumental sounds is almost eliminted because each number ""features"" a band member singing to the music, and rather poorly at that."
5,This is a GREAT product,"Believe or not, I have purchased two other brands' 5.8 cordless phones before but returned them less than a week. But this time I have been using it for weeks already and I will keep it. It met all my satisfactions and I gave two thumbs up. The sound quality is crystal clear and the intercom is so handy. Best of all, the built-in three mailboxes is a nice feature and my kids felt repected because they have their own mailboxes. The price is no where else you can find and it is the best especially with three handsets."
1,Does not work in a DSL phone line,"I received this phone and it looks great. We connected it to the line where our old 900mgz phone is connected to and it brought down our DSL line. I contacted Motorola and they explained their phone can not be connected to the same line my computer is connected, it will not work with a DSL line. I am very disappointed a brand new telephone not compatible with DSL is illogical. I am returning the phone, we only have one phone line into the house the old phone works just fine."
1,A deceiptful sale byt he merchant,The battery has failed within one week. The merchant has been uncooperative and discourteous. He has sold a product as new while it appears it isn'tPlease remove this company from your authorized dealers.Amazon's reputation suffers because of dealers like this.
3,It is ok.,"Good to have tabs so that I can categorize the business pages, however, the tabs bends and breaks easily. Be careful not to bend the tab too often, it falls off. Have to use a tape to keep them in place."
5,Short and sweet,"On a whim we recently borrowed this from our local library. My 3.5 year old daughter loved it, and I did too (39 yr old). It's beautiful but not glossy or slick. The editorial review said younger kids may not get it, but my daughter had no trouble. Perhaps that is because she's very familiar with the Paul O. Zelinsky book of Rapunzel (which I also highly recommend). The dialog and narration in the two were surprisingly similar, except this video did not have Rapunzel get pregnant (a potential sticking point with the book for some). We watched it many times the week we borrowed it from the library, and we'll undoubtedly borrow it again sometime, but still to me the price seems high for a 15 minute VHS."
5,Superb performances,"When it came to tinkering around with his music and providing this version and that version, Charles Ives was a bit of an Anton Bruckner. It was Michael Tilson Thomas and the redoubtable Chicago Symphony Orchestra who came out with first recordings of Ives' revised editions of both these symphonies. The first, while a charming piece, is very much a student work, but the majestic fourth is probably the blazing pinnacle of American symphonic music. Paraphrases of four hymns that Ives uses in his piece de resistance make a pleasing musical interlude between the two symphonies. If you are an Ives fan, and sadly many people are not, then this CD is an absolute must."
1,DO NOT BUY TOM TOM!!!!,"Well...this product looks great, but the love affair ended there. I was very shocked when I recently bought this unit and found out that the maps are very, very, VERY outdated. It seems as if they are from around 1990 as so many highway updates are not included. Subsequently, the device is more or less useless as every time it hits a new stretch of road or new on-ramp, it gets ""lost"" and stops giving directions.I contacted Tom Tom and even though they have newer maps and that they admitted that the maps in this piece of garbage are outdated--they had the audacity to tell me I had to purchase a new set of maps for $110.So, make sure you add $100 to trhe purchase price, because it will be completely useless out of the box!!I am a professional who drives daily over a 3 state region and will buy a Garmin and surely encourage you do the same!!!"
2,Great potential but major annoyances!,"I am an expreienced user of GPS Navigation systems. This is my fourth unit. This product has a lot of nice features but many annoyances. If everything worked easily, I would give it a 5 star rating.PROS:Blue Tooth HandsfreeTraffic Updates via bluetooth ( via GPRS)Various configurable options on routes - fast, toll roads, color of maps, voice selections, choice of languages, etc.CONS:Hard to get BLUE TOOTH to work with my phone - TREO 650Does not display name of current Road! Displays name of next road insteadNo configuration of level of voice commands. No speaking street names.Could not find a way to call Destination phone!When searching for POIs, does not display the address of POI!Cannot call a POI phone number!Poor support and website( hard to navigate and find what you need)I would not have bought it if I knew it had above drawbacks despite being feature rich."
2,Gives examples but not many answers.,"The information in this book could be written on one sheet.There are several examples and statements about what you mightencounter if you try to review your bill, but little to informyou how to respond to the obstacles (other than pay theauthors to review for you). The average price and region variationsmay be interesting, but have nothing to do with understandingthe bill. I was very disappointed."
2,Great while it lasts,"Its a fine product if you need it as a placeholder untill you can upgrade.Had this item for a few months and it lost most of its function.The warrenty is hard to follow up on and the customer support is poor.Pros: Cheap , Small , BlackCons: Small backspace key, Small, Dies quick, pain to follow up on warrenty."
3,Just short of the mark,"Despite Dennis Waterman's not having much good to say about this film in his autobiography REMINDER, I felt lucky to have found a copy of the VHS. While it is not my usual taste in movies, I watched it objectively. The Father Jim role was not developed sufficiently; at least, not as well as the boxer role. The supporting roles were very well portrayed. I may be gullible, but I didn't believe Father Jim was a con man, despite the circumstantial evidence - and the description on the box. However, that final scene was something. Gave me nightmares, probably because I've become quite a fan of Mr. Waterman after seeing some of his other work. Even if this movie wasn't a commercial success, it does give the viewer a lot to think about."
5,Flying Spitfires and Mustangs in WW II,As a civilian pilot myself I was impressed with his accounts of his training as well as the accounts of his many missions. I was amazed at how much flying he did and impressed by his ability to describe his missions. Overall I found this to be one of the best of the many books I have read about World War II.
5,Best Pro Tools Book for Musicians on the market,"I started home recording with Pro Tools 2 years ago. I went through a lot of books, but this one was definitely a stand-out. I recommend it highly. The BIG difference with this book is that it is written around practical application of the tools. It is not a re-write of the Pro Tools Reference Manual like so many of the other books are."
3,False Advertising?,"I was a real fan of this line of dog treats until one day, I noticed on the back of the bag, the fine print, that read, ""MADE IN CHINA"". How can a dog treat that states cage free chickens and all natural come from China? Its rare to hear of a cage free chicken coup in China of all places. And the standards of inspection are quite lax to say the least. I have since found better alternatives that I can be more comfortable in giving my dog, such as Plato Natural Organic Chicken made here in the USA."
1,My dog got ill after eating these treats...,"My dog got ill after eating these treats (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting). I would not recommend them to any other pet owner and I agree that folks should be concerned about the ""Made in China"" aspect of these treats. The packaging makes them appealing as a natural healthy treat for dogs, but purchase with caution."
1,Why Such A Fuss Over This Second-Rate Recording?,"This disc is so second-rate, I cannot understand the fuss. A mediocre orchestra under a mediocre conductor gives a mediocre performance, and many American critics have gone into raptures. It is incomprehensible. Stick with the classic performances by Reiner or Beecham or Karajan or Haitink, all of which provide many times the pleasure of this undistinguished release. On merit, this release should already have hit the remainder bins."
1,Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Although I am a huge 24 fan, I was very disappointed with this book. This is not 24. First, there is too much vulgarity and profanity. I do not remember Operation Hell Gate being that way. Also, I was distracted by the writer's left-wing political views. Clearly, this is a person who opposes the Patriot Act, and the way we are fighting the war against terrorism. Can you really see this Kelly person being at CTU? Can you really see Senator Drexler being a ""good guy"" on a 24 episode? There were times when I felt like I was reading something by Michael Moore. Someone who thinks that the Patriot Act is the greater threat to our freedom, not people who want to kill us. The action was great, but when looking at the total picture, I would advise you not to buy/read this book. Marc Cerrsini has a new 24 novel coming out this Spring. He wrote Operation Hell Gate. I look forward to it."
2,Not really related to the show,"I agree that this book wasn't very well written. As a thriller, it wasn't that bad of a book, but as an 'episode' of 24, it wasn't good at all. The characters may have been named Jack Bauer, Nina Meyers, Tony Almeida, etc., but they weren't at all the same as the TV characters. They might have been named Joe Smith and Mary Jones for all the resemblance they had to their TV counterparts, which is none. Also, some of the mistakes made in this book were just plain stupid (check the president's itinerary, people!), and Jack and CTU really came off looking bad more than once. Lastly, there was no conclusion or closure, no tying up of loose ends; it just.... ended. I've read ""Hell Gate,"" and it was pretty good, and I'm looking forward to ""Trojan Horse."" I'm sure I'll be able to give it more than two stars."
4,Good product,Choose this item as we finally went from dial-up to DSL and needed filters. So far these have been excellent.
3,Decent deal but pods are better,"I bought these before I started buying the replacement pods that go inside these. If your looking for easiest and quickest and willing to spend the extra $$ then these are the way to go but if $$ is what your wanting to save, then buy the pods they are about $9 or $10 for three of them."
1,Received broken,We put this in our vcr/dvd player as soon as we received it and it didn't even work. :( My boys were so disappointed.
4,Mileage log,The book has a couple different ways to record and summarize your information but the mileage log pages only allow for a few records. I make a lot of trips each week and a weeks worth ends up taking up a few pages. I would recommend finding one with more record space per page. It works fine for me I'll just have to buy a couple per year for now.
4,D-Link DGS-2205 5-Port,This Switch works near flawlessly minor issues with the router on assigning an Ip to the attached computer resolved by rebooting
3,You get what you pay for,"This switch is OK, but it does drop packets under load. I still use it to support a PC and a network printer, but not as my secondary hub with all 5 ports needed. In the more demanding role, it dropped packets when I did throughput tests. Every 3rd or 4th test would fail with a time-out. Replaced it with a Netgear 8 port GE managed switch and no more time-outs. Note that I am using a 16 port GE Netgear switch as my main hub. So not horrible for UDP applications. But not one I'd buy again, either."
2,works great for 12-15 months...,"... then the power adapter fails. I'd bought 2 of these, and both power adapters failed after the warranty period had lapsed."
2,died after about 2 years,"The power supply that is... i have an 8 port one that still works, but I am worried about that now since it uses the same power supply.I checked and it's 5v at 1.2aSo I remembered that I had a usb cd drive that took additional power from usb. So I plugged that cord into my htc's phone charger and plugged it into the switch.Back in action.It also worked via the pc's usb slot, which is surprising since I believe usb only gives 100ma if it does not give a data signal or something from a computer. Don't quote me on that.I am worried about my 8 port one now since I don't have anything for that unless I spliced the cable open and soldered a usb conenctor at the end."
5,Best value for money Switch,I use this with a Gigabit router (WRT 320) for creating the Cluster computing. It gives the the 1000Mb/s bandwidth and with cat6 cabling there are no errors in the packets transmitted.If you are looking for unmanaged switch dont even think about any thing else.There is one drawback if you connect a 10/100 Mb/s connection to this one it fallback to lower speeds. Solution buy 2 switches one 10/100 and another 10/100/1000 and dedicate them to respective connection. After all this is a cheap (but good quality)switch rite?
5,D-Link Desktop Switch,Ran out of ports on my router and needed to expand. Great product! Does the job with speed and without any hang-ups. Amazon had the best price and shipping was free and speedy.
4,Product 5/ Support Docs 1,"I love the product. It was easy to install - however - I wanted to further network so I popped the DVD in the computer to learn more about the product. It was blank! I then called the company and informed them that I received a blank DVD and they told me that all the DVD's were sent out blank!!! What??? So, if you know how to network and don't need further information -- then I would highly suggest this product. If you need technical support -- use another product!"
4,hard to figure out if this is the correct item,this item is presented incorrectly by photo and description. I had to read reviews to figure out that this was the correct item. the item itself was correct and easy to install.
1,not the right product,"I ordered it on the advice of a review of the product, but it was the wrong piece. I returned it promptly and am awaiting a refund. The product was shipped promptly, and I would deal with this company again."
5,Just as good 30 years later!,"I read this book as a Reader's Digest Condensed feature as a teenager. It was such an entertaining story that I went back to it again and again. Years later, I saw it at the library in its complete hardcover version, and read it again. To my delight, the tale had not become too elementary or dated. It has an unusual setting, well-developed characters and avoids the usual trite ""happy ending"" that is so very common in this type of romantic fiction. I have ordered a used copy from Amazon and will be thrilled to have it as part of my favorite book collection."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PROCT, IT IS DANGEROUS...",I would not buy this product. I bought one and had to return it due the rubb/plastic smell our apt got while I was cooking. We could not eat the food as it tasted plastic. We returned it and got a new one. The same problem happened and we had to returned it again. I'm still looking for a pressure cooker and would love some suggestions. FARGOR NEVER AGAIN! It is made in china - not sure what metal they use...
5,The best I've ever had,This pressure cooker set is the best I have ever owned. It is extremely easy to use and clean up. The heavy bottom keeps the heat evenly distributed so no hot spots or scorching of the food.
2,Lacking on technical support,"Prior to purchasing two of these monitors, I had called technical support at Viewsonic to ask if these monitors can support a specific function. I was assured by not one, but two techies that it could.I have received my monitors, they are beautiful, but never got them going because now the techies are saying that the monitors cannot support what I need to get done. Now, I have to go through the return process.If I ever got the monitors to work, I'm sure they would have been great, like the other reviewers comments, but that just wasn't the case. I knew the price and offer was too good to be true.Again, beautiful monitors, but just be wary to tech support."
5,A pleasant listen,"When I heard he was doing a cover cd, I thought great; it will be kind of neat to hear him do some different kinds of music. Well, I'm not disappointed. I don't understand some people's disappointment with this cd. Do you think any artist that does a cover cd is looking to win a Grammy? I find this cd to be very relaxing. I also think several of his covers are very emotional,possibly songs that touched him at some point."
5,RICK DOES IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!,"AS A HUGE RICK SPRINGFIELD FAN I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I FIRST HEARD HE WAS RELEASING A CD OF ""SONGS HE WISH HE HAD WRITTEN"", I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. NOW THAT I HAVE PURCHASED THIS CD AND LISTENED TO IT, IT IS SO AWESOME. IF YOU ARE ANY KIND OF RICK FAN BUY THIS!!!!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. I AM SURE MANY OTHER RICK FANS WILL AGREE. IT WAS NICE TO HEAR RICK SINGING SOME OF THE SONGS I LOVED IN THE 80'S. THANKS RICK. WE LOVE YOU!!!"
4,"Nice to hear these songs again, truly.","I particularly like the first eight tracks on the album. Great to hear Rick's cover of 10cc's ""I'm Not in Love"" because I loved the original so much. Rick's voice is sweet, haunting, in these ballads. After reading another person's review on this site, I disagree with reviewer Mr. Stein; I appreciate that Rick kept his covers close to the original sound. And I think having a Richard Page duet on ""Broken Wings"" was a beautiful, nostalgic touch. Very cool, Rick.If anyone is reading this review, be sure to check out Rick's ""Written In Rock Anthology"" - his compilation of his career hits. The liner notes provide great insight into his life and inspiration for his music. By the way, you must see Rick in concert, because the one thing this new album of ballads doesn't show you is how much energy Rick exudes in his performances. I saw him in '82 and in '05, and I promise you that he rocks harder now and puts on a better show today than he did then. You go, Rick!"
3,Kessinger edition--Not what I expected,"The other reviews discussed different editions Of Splendor Solis, NOT the one you will get if you order THIS book--the paperback from Kessinger Publishing, by Elizabeth Sharpe. I ordered it, having read the reviews, thinking that this book was the one being referred to. Not so. This book is only 104 pages, rather than the 140 pages listed in the product description. The illustrations are all black and white, and poorly reproduced. The images are blurred and undefined, almost like Xerox copies. The text is interesting, but I would recommend spending a little more and getting a copy with good color illustrations."
2,Good - But my son's arm keeps getting stuck!,"I like that the highchair doesn't require assembly. Its easy enough to use, no better no worse than any other highchair. The biggest problem I have is that my son's arm keeps getting stuck between the chair and the top of the legs! I looked into this a bit, and am surprised there is no recall. I'm sure there will be one soon. Wait until they fix this before you buy it."
1,My daughter's arms get stuck too!,"I am having the same problem as the previous reviewer. My daughter is 6 months old and gets her arms stuck every time I put her in this highchair without the big tray. She is on the small side for her age (14 pounds) but I just cant get over how easy it is for her arms to get SO stuck. She has little marks on them after I get them out. This is the ONE thing I hate about this chair. Other than that, it is a decent highchair. I am quite disappointed with the design, after using it now."
1,unhappy with it,because i was looking for the series not a review of the show. 5 year old grandson was disappointed. did not understand from discription that the show was not included
2,Should've paid closer attention,Thought this was the series but is a documentary. Gives back story on the actors and other little Batman trivia. Not what I was looking for but not bad.
3,Interesting read,"This book was required in my Mexican History class, I found it to be pretty interesting there are a lot of facts presented but the author also makes his opinion heard, he is not very impartial."
3,Randy the trailblazer,"Captain Blume's book is a largely-anecdotal, partly-apocryphal history of her flying career. Her account, a trifle sanctimonious in places, traces her rise from student pilot up through the ranks of flight instructor, entry-level engineer, and captain. Hers was a typical progression, hence its humor. What really set her story apart was her gender in a macho, traditionally all-male profession. The protagonist starts out as an Ivy League-bound journalism co-ed. She ends up bouncing back and forth between snob mother, college roomate, and adolescent-minded male pilots. Whatever the stage of one's career, all aviation-related professionals--pilots, dispatchers, schedulers--will bond with Blume's novel."
2,How to Prepare for the Writing Tasks of the Next Generation TOEFL: A Complete Course with 187 Sample Essays,"While I find this book refreshingly different from the Barron's TOEFL Essay book, I have only read the first 25 pages and find it full of mistakes! It has many useful features, but be extremely careful using it because of the errors."
5,Wonderful,"I spent time in Turkana and I love this book. It is a beautiful place, in it's own way, and the people were wonderful"
1,was nice while it lasted,"This was very handy when i got to use it for a couple of weeks before it broke. It snapped apart and a piece almost went into my daughters eye! I was upset that this doesn't have the durability to last longer than 2 weeks. I did not like that this has three prongs because sometimes i cant plug it in. or that there is only one other end not multiples. back to my old, plain extension cord that doesn't retract but isnt dangerous. love retractable cords because i travel so much."
5,American Indians are the Greatest Story Tellers,"Native Americans are the greatest story tellers. Sherman Alexie is the best of the best. This is the best book of short stories that I have ever read, and I consider it a masterpiece of contemporary fiction.One of the things I liked the most about it was that while each story carries some of the same themes of how being a Native American is ironically kind of like being a stranger in a strange land, the characters in each story are all unique and three dimensional. I liked that I was able to hear the voice of a reservation Indian telling these stories...complete with the inflections and accent inherent in their speech. I liked the marriage of the dream world, and spirit world with the physical world throughout the book. I liked the way Alexie describes each character's motivations and inner struggles.If you have ever met an Indian from any reservation anywhere in the United States, you will SO get this book."
2,A change of pace for Alexie,"As much as I've loved Alexie's work in the past, I'm sorry to say this book really disappointed me. There is certainly some lovely prose and a few moments that truly moved me, but overall this book, for me, simply lacked the sparkle and emotion always present in Alexie's previous works. There were moments, in fact, where I felt he was simply trying to shock us with the writing, which seems way too cheap for a writer of such talent."
5,My daughter likes it...,"Of all the games for this age range that my daughter has, this is one of her favorites. Some of the graphics on these games are kind of crappy, this one is pretty good and like I said she likes it..."
5,"Not the Best, but close.","Excellent power, seems to pull in all short hair pieces, and not TOO loud.a little wide, but good cutting head, no pulling, and doesn't seem to nick skin like the old norelco's. Havn't used with the longer fur adapter.Wish i could get the old t9800, but am pretty happy with this one."
5,Coleman Self-inflating Camp Pad,I purchased these items thru Amazon. The Coleman camp pads are great. Followed the instructions and these are just great for the grand kids in the tent.They dearly love these. When they come to grandpa and grandma's the first thing they want is the tent and their Coleman pads. The price was good and the shippingtime was very quick. Thanks again to GoCampingCheap.
3,Great for the Money,"Easy to use, very straight forward and for the price, can't be beat! Would definitely buy this again to use for tax keeping purposes."
4,Dome(R) Auto Mileage Log And Expense Record,"We've used these to keep track of total mileage, business mileage, and expenses for years. Very comprehensive. Enough pages to last the entire year on a daily basis with monthly summary pages. It's one of the best I've seen for this purpose at a reasonable price."
4,Enjoyable easy steps,"I have knit five of the squares since receiving the book, and am enjoying trying new stitch patterns on such small do-able squares which remove the drudgery of having to create a whole garment.There is good explanation of how to do various techniques such as slip stitching, joining new colours etc. However, I did not find the book's instruction very clear on how to actually knit the basic knit/purl stitches, how to control the tension, how to hold the needles etc. For that, I had to turn to the internet where there are various free instructional videos demonstrating the Continental technique used in this book.I expect to be pleased with my finished afghan, but as I will not be learning any shaping techniques (decreasing/increasing) I do not feel that I will be confident to knit a garment right away after completing this book."
4,very useful,the avery economy clear sheet protectors is just what I needed to preserve some family journals but I the sheets were just a little thinner that I thought they would be
4,Sheet Protectors,"I purchased these sheet protectors and I feel like they may be the ones that Avery doesn't want to sell to ""non-discount"" stores. They worked perfectly fine for what I needed. But they didn't appear to be cut right by the 3-ring holes. There were little pieces hanging off of them that needed to be cut. It isn't a smooth edge along that area. It did not effect the three hole punches and it did not effect the area where a paper is inserted. So it is more of a cosmetic issue.I did not contact the company about this. I purchased other items from this company and have had no problems with them."
2,Popped the first time I used it!,"Got this at Walmart when I was in a bind. The first time I used it, it 'popped' and lost all it's air pressure. I did inflate it by mouth a bit, but I also only weigh 185. I will return tomorrow...with a sore back."
4,Comfortable,"Comfortable pad. This is our second one, quickly replaced after the first one developed a leak after years of use."
3,Just OK,"Good for fun facts and some basic science, but written with a fairly arrogant tone. But I suppose that's to be expected from a book with a title that compares its writer to Einstein..."
1,Look Elsewhere for a Better Book,"As one reviewer pointed out there are a few pearls of wisdom (the science of a good gravy) in this otherwise wordy and fairly patronizing book. I was looking for a book to explain the small nuances of how to improve a particular recipe or tweak an ingredient to bring out its fullest potential but I what I found was pretty much a garbled and condescending chemistry lesson -- and not a very good one at that. Wolke's side comments under ""Techspeak"" were both confusing and grating. This attitude is something I put up with while going through engineering school but I won't put up with it on my free time with a subject matter I love. Half-way into the book, I just couldn't take it anymore. This is quite a shame because Wolke is a technical consultant for one of the best cooking magazines around -- Cook's Illustrated. Thankfully for us, though, Cook's Illustrated has someone other than Wolke do the writing."
3,Salt,"I only read the pages that Amazon let you ""look inside"", but one statement still has me baffled. ""You can't taste rocks."" Salt is a rock. Rocks are made of minerals. Is the author saying we can't taste minerals?"
4,Phrases that sell!,"Very well done! The books are fantastic and will sure help the team perform better. The delivery was on time, as expected! Thank You Amazon"
2,Doesn't Get Used Much,I rarely if ever see either of my two cats use this product. I suppose it would depend on your cat but this is one item they could have lived without.
4,Good but hard to find...,"I first started purchasing this item from the original website but now they don't sell it anymore. So I had to buy it from amazon and it was quite a few dollars more expensive then I would have liked to pay. However, my dogs love it and it is great on their paws after their bath. I hope I will still be able to find it in the future."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"Another simplistic, generic, super conventional, template-derived, power-pop emo band. If they had any respect for music they would stop what they're doing right now."
4,good for professional bookkeeping.....,"This is a very good book for professional and business but I was looking for a book more for the family. For the reasonable price of seven dollars, I made it work. I like the way it lays flat when opened. Its an extremely good quality book."
4,Perfect Old School Bookkeeping,"I have a small business - online retail only, and this is the perfect bookkeeping system for us. We don't need advanced software that keeps track of jobs, estimates, invoices, overdue accounts receivable - we just need something to track expenses out and cash coming in. Perfect! I fill this out monthly, and bring it to my book keeper at the end of the year. She can get our taxes complete in less than an hour, which saves us a considerable amount of money.My only suggestion would be that it were updated with more accounts, or allow for a couple of more blank categories. Some things don't really fit, and are good to have separate for cost analysis, such as internet fees, web hosting, digital images and web design, etc."
3,Extension of factory warrenty,This warrenty is an extension of the factory warrenty. If it breaks from being knocked over...my loss. I'm looking at getting it added additionally to my insurance or through a llc I'm planning on starting up.
3,WON'T KNOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS!!,Hard to review a service plan on a brand new camcorder!! Let ya know later!
2,Careful! Any self resepecting sound system should just quit!,"This is some of the worst music (pardon the positive noun there, it's barely music) to have ever been made permanent by the recorded medium.The Grateful Dead were sometimes a truly groundbreaking band, sometimes a great live party band, sometimes tired and misdirected old men.Bob Dylan, prior to his motorcycle accident was the voice of a generation. later an artist searching for a message and only sometimes finding it.Combine the two, and you get tired sounding renditions of historically great tunes. The vocals sound like drunks doing karaoke, the instrumentation is lacksadaisical to the point of nausea.Turn it OFF!! Don't hurt your music player!"
3,not the highest quality design,"These work well enough for most purposes, but be warned that (1) they are not big enough for european cards. I end up having to shave down those cards with a pair of scissors, which is insane. (2) To insert two cards, back to back, so that both side of the sleeve get used, you have to put them in the same pocket. This can crimp or bend them, and it means you typically have to take them both out at once as well, even if you only want one. There are better sleeves with pockets on both sides that don't have this problem."
1,Quality control?,I watched Code of Silence last night and I had to stop in the middle. The audio was about 3 seconds off from the video. Do not buy this. I am returning my copy.
1,"High tech looking water boiler, but with a lot of flaws","Its volume can be larger, this one is only 2.2L, for some reasons, some dark deposits (rust?) keep accumulating on the inside anti-stick coating. Or are they coming out of the seams? Can't really tell. Very disturbing. I already sent in to the Zojirushi US for liner replacement last year. The black deposit remained within 1~2 days, plus they screwed up the base and the thing wobbles a lil'. Just days ago, water leaked through the unit base (not even plugged in as I was away) and damaged my granite countertop (that was no longer pure tap water and it passed through the interior and was saturated with a lot of chemical crap)!! Avoid this unit at all cost. And find a stainless steel interior water boiler like the Twinhorse one..."
1,Description unclear,"The quality of th eproduct was excellent, but did not meet my needs at all. The description did not explain the format well so I ordered an unusable item."
5,Good for Alarm systems,"I purchase this item to replace the battery on the alarm system fits perfect and at a resonable price, would recommend it to family and friends"
3,Needs a charge,The battery needed a trickle charge before it worked properly. This was mentioned in the data supplied with product. Satisfied with it.
1,Very Unstructured. Lacks examples/illustrations.,"If you have money to burn, go ahead... Otherwise, all I can say is that reading this book was like reading a glossary on Application Service Providers. The book severely lacks examples or illustrations which are necessary for any reader to understand the contents more effectively. More real world examples or case studies would have helped. Frankly, I was able to learn more from the ASP resource center on pcweek.com than I have reading this book. Very unstructured, very dull writing style, and a total waste of money."
4,Fine jazz trio recording,"I readily agree with the other review. Here is some excellent piano playing by a perhaps less well-known pianist who has always been a musicians' favourite, though. Lisle Atkinson and Paul Humphrey on bass and drums, respectively make up a fine rhythm team, especially on the mid to up-tempo tunes. There are also excellent, original arrangements of well-known material - 'Caravan', for example.Three numbers are solo piano and recorded in a New York studio. I'm less enthusiastic about those. The recording of the piano sound is thin and tends towards tinniness. Doesn't sound like a professional recording at all in fact. And also, there is the, to me, recurrent problem of the contemporary jazz pianist's left hand. What to do with it? Simmons chooses the anachronistic 'swing' bass left hand. If we want that, go back to Tatum and Teddy Wilson.But the seven trio numbers, recorded in Japan, are a joy."
2,This product is stated to fit a 2010 Acura MDX. It does NOT.,It looks like a quality filter but it doesn't fit as recommended. This product is stated to fit a 2010 Acura MDX. It does NOT
4,"Holds a LOT of pages, not good for things smaller than 8.5x11","I bought these to keep in a giant binder for all the various instruction manuals one collects from vacuums and televisions and microwaves. I guess I thought that since they were all ""multi-page"" booklets, this would be the right kind. The problem is that most of the booklets I seem to have are 6x9 or so and so they just slide around all over the place. I think I will have to get the one-page kind and see if they work better. They also tend to want to fall down out of the binder (kind of, hard to describe) with the smaller booklets. They work fine for the full size sheets. The quality of the plastic is exactly what you expect from Avery, and they are clear and shiny and turn well."
2,"Nicholson, NO!","Oh Nicholson Baker, just when I'm about to crown you my favorite and grudgingly pass all of your books along to my best friends, I read ""A Box of Matches,"" a novel which is less novel than a writing exercise legitimized as literature by a printer. I was shocked by ""VOX"" and fawned over ""The Fermata,"" I even loved ""Double Fold,"" his non-fiction turn on the assault on paper. But this book will make most of you feel like you are wasting your time.A man wakes up every morning around five, lights a match, and thinks. That's it. His thoughts range from piquant to gross to nostalgic to melancholy. I'm not the kind of reader to expect world-changing events to take place in my literature. But I do like to care about my characters -- and this guy didn't cut it. Pick up one of Baker's other, more worthwhile books."
5,"""The ultimate measure of a man...""","One of my favorite quotes came from this book:The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.Martin Luther King Jr., Strength to Love, 1963US black civil rights leader & clergyman (1929 - 1968)"
3,Great workout but badly edited,"If you are already a Rachel brice fan you're in for a big disappointment. The art direction in this video is almost nonexistent and the editing is horrible. The performance is so badly editied, with many cut aways, that you rarely get to see any move to its completion. It doesn't even show a 10th of how fabulous Rachel is. However; despite the horrible editing and someone's bad idea of set design, the workout/instruction is great and I love that you can do the workout in 15, 30 and 45 minute sets."
5,Exactly what it claims to be,"Some of the negative reviews of this video has some valid points, but I think they're approaching it from the wrong POV. This video is to help you refine your movement, not teach you new moves. It's a practice companion, made to help strengthen the dancer and refine their movement. I really enjoyed it. I already KNEW the moves she went over, but she helped me understand them on a different level and as a person with occasional motivation problems, I know I can go into autopilot mode and get a good workout. It's about drilling, not about learning. If you're looking for an instructional video, this might not be the one you want. If you're looking for a PRACTICE COMPANION, it's exactly what you want. The yoga is beneficial to the dancer and the moves are basic enough that they transcend style, really."
2,why did i do it,i thought it would be a combo of a lil bit of this & a lil bit of dat. It was a lil bit of what & a whole lot of girl get your money back. No really i watched it before i was gona try it like i do all my other vids & i was like what is this. Don't get me wrong i love rachels work but i think they could have planed it out a lil better before selling it to the public
3,Disappointing,"If you are already down with the basics, this will be a waste of time. I do pop in the DVD every so often just for fun. I find it inspirational, if nothing else."
1,Teaching or exhibit?,"Though Rachel is amazing, she can discourage beginning dancers with unrealistic moves that are unattainable to most. I love tribal style, however most of this teaching method was lacking and looked more like a personal workout and exhibit.The short clips of performance remind me of a contortionist. I did not gain anything from this video ."
1,Does not fit Canon T1i,I have a canon T1i with a 3-in LCD and this product does not fit on it's LCD.
2,"Belkin Pop-Up shade for 3"" LCD screen",Bought for one reason: to eliminate glare on screen when outdoors. It does not eliminate the glare. It mat reduce it by 25% at best.
2,Does not perform very well,I purchased this to use on my non viewfinder cameras. It will stick to the first one but I noticed no real difference in viewing the scene on my camera. Once it is removed I found it to be questionable as to whether it would stick.
2,Won't work with touch screens.,Great little product. Unfortunately I can't use it as there is a non-removeable clear plastic screen cover attached to it and I have a 3 in. touchscreen camera.
3,Not great,"Well the product is flimsy, hard to get used to, and clunky. I ended up taking it off after a week. Perhaps for some this will work fine, for me I thought it was a waste of money."
3,good for a beginner,"It was a little diffucult to put together but that should not put you off. My only complaint is that one of the plastic footings wa cracked because it was not properly loaded or unloaded off the truck, as far as the bike goes it works well and its a great buy."
3,BE CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING THIS ITEM,"This is just a warning. I had to cancel this order bc when I chose the ""42 inch brown leather"" selection, the item pictured (when you chose this option) is not what you are ordering. It is LIGHT OAK rather than the (darker) wood shown in the picture (which is what I was looking for). BE SURE TO READ THE DESCRIPTION in your shopping cart before you check out. The description prior to your shopping cart is not clear."
2,Started off good but...,"I loved the first two seasons of this series but after that it started going downhill. Now it's the same diatribe each week. The crime, the tag line from Cane and the investigation and conclusion. The characters have turned into automatons. Robotic people, who hardly if ever crack a smile or joke with each other or show any kind of emotion. It's boring and unrealistic. The series has now taken a slight turn to the absurd with some of the storylines. The realism has gone out the window and they've traded it in for the typical hollywood glam. Not something I'd recommend after the first two seasons."
3,Not bad,but smaller than size indicated. Leather doesn't look like real even though it is. Had to return.
4,Smells good and lasts all day,"The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 like everyone else is that in a blind smell test, my wife liked ""Curve Soul"" and ""Diesel only the brave"" better. Curve Soul only lasts a couple of hours and Diesel is very expensive so this is still a good choice."
4,Adequate for its purpose,"This bag is fine for carrying various supplies, such as exam tools, etc. It is light weight, though can seem a bit flimsy until a fair amount a material is packed inside. It does not have hard sides or a hard floor. It is adequate for my needs to throw in the car."
5,excellent product and service,I am happy with the service I received. The product was shipped quickly and was everything it was advertised to be. Thanks!
5,Britney ON TOP!,"I can not wait for this DVD to come out. I was so young when this show was on that I barely remember it. I just remember how much love I had back than for Britney, and here she is, ON TOP of the DVD. I can not wait to relive all the memories that started my love for the biggest POP SENSATION of all TIME!"
2,"Hi, I was wondering if someone could tell me this?","Can anyone tell me what songs are on this DVD that were actually shot on the show. For instance The pilot show for ""The New MMC"" in which they did ""Got No Shame"" by Brother Cane or perhaps When they did ""Little Miss Can't Be Wrong by the Spin Doctors? Any help here would be grately appeciated.Thanks"
2,AT LEAST I DIDNT PAY FULL PRICE,I got this dvd thinking it would be the best of justin and christina ...and it was like 4 boring mmc shows and xtina britney and justin wernt even in any of them really lol WASTE of my time and money....ONLY HARDCORE fans should get this dvd
1,Never worked!,My Surround Air never worked with the power adapter. I never tried it with batteries since it didn't work when I plugged it in. I'm returning it tomorrow.
3,"Not for cashmere, but otherwise okay","I had no trouble with this shaver stopping, but it ate holes in all my cashmere sweaters. It's fine for less delicate knits and polarfleece, though. It does have a very wide head for shaving, and having an AC cord means it doesn't lose power."
4,One of the best units around for the price,I've this unit for about 6 months now and it still works fine. It's a little more work then they like to make you believe but it will do the job. I bought it to remove pilling from our bed sheets. Does not remove them completely but does get rid of most of them with alittle time and work. Highly recommend that you use the A/C adapter as it will go though batteries quickly on large jobs such as sheets. I have not used it on clothing so I can't comment on how well it does there.
2,"Spend the extra money, buy a better shaver",I had the same problem with mine stopping. We must have got a defective batch. It got to the point where it wouldn't even turn on anymore. When it did run it was really great. Now in the market for a better electric shaver.
2,Not white,"I paid a slight premium for this cable in hopes of getting a trully white color, just like the image. Cable packaging sticker says white, but the cable is off white, more gray than white."
4,Mickey Mouse Club Sampler Platter,"Dont get comfy in your favorite seat expecting an in depth report on the golden days of the Disney Mickey Mouse Club, plus the footage here is mostly B/W. This is like sitting on the opposite side of the deep end of the swimming pool, it just gets your feet wet. Outstanding reason for this dvd is the Pet Shop with Darlene Gillespie and the boys swanking a tidy number."
1,Of Oranges and Narcos...,"Rest assured, I did not want to read this book and neither did my whole class. But seeing as how it was assigned, we had to endure the randomness that ensued. I am giving this book to a friend--now that I finished it--for they need help falling asleep on long plane rides."
4,Baumgartens ID Badge Holders,"I like these because they are light weight. Our company uses the hard plastic holders, which are great but wear out the badge reel quickly because of the weight. These tear easier but serves my purposes."
5,LOVED IT!,"This book was fantastic. Very understandable, practical and insightful. I would recommend this to any and everyone. I have gifted it to a couple of friends and they have enjoyed it also."
4,No butter dog?!,The anime is my fav of all time! The live action version was good. Not as great as I thought it would have been. Ill watch it again. The ending was good too but there is a part two coming. If you liked the anime then you might enjoy the L.A. version.
4,Mormonism,"A very good study and perspective from an individual from outside the Mormon culture, but one that has obviously done substantial inquiry and investigation into, and gained considerable insights about the culture."
2,Disappointed,"I have 3 children ages 8,3 and 2. It takes 2 people to put this together and it takes extra tools. You have to go through alot of trouble just to get the table down flat. Too many holes that hold rain water. The benches bow with my 25 pound 2yr old on it. I would not try to put more than 4 small children on this table. It has not colapsed yet, but it looks like it could at anytime. The height is good. My children love it so we have kept it. Not one of Little Tikes best designs and not worth the price."
2,"watch out, it collapses","Along with the other reviews that describe the difficulty in putting the table together, I have to say that in the 2 days that we have had the table ""up"", it has collapsed 3 times.The first time I thought it was just because I tried to sit on the table and that one of the legs wasn't locked, but then I made sure that all the legs were in their correct positions and it still collapsed a while later with two kids on it.It would be a nice table, size wise and the natural tones, but if we can't get it to stay up, it will have to go back."
5,A book with Gotrek and Felix can never be wrong!,"Once agien William King has done it! Another amazing book, with some of the best action ever! For those of you who are looking for a fantasy book get trollslayer (the first of the series), and work your way up to the fantastic Giantslayer. Now their are some bad reviews of Giantslayer as well as the other slayer books. IGNORE THEM! The people who wrote them are the same people who failed their SAT's and got the great job as a trash man. I have read all of William King's books over and over and would give them nothing short of 5 stars. Giantslayer may lack a bit of action compared to others, but it's finale battle makes up for that and more!"
4,A great read!,Another solid sword & sorcery novel from William King. The introduction ofthe elven archmage Teclis provides a rare glimpse into the culture of an interesting Old World race that this series had largely ignored.
3,Introduction to Flight,"I am a student of Aerospace engineering in the University of Florida, and I used this book in an introductory course. Aside from a few sections entitled ""Design Boxes"" I found the book veered away form topics usually included in an introductory book. The author is so overly concerned with trying to prove his equations mathematically that he looses sight of the big picture. Personally, I have found model airplane books to be much more useful for an introduction to basic airplane design than this monstrosity."
1,This is JUNK,"According to all the information that I read about this mirror ball motor, it was supposed to work with the 16"" mirror ball I bought to go with it. The motor was jerky and often stopped throughout the evening. Now, it doesn't even spin around and just hums. To make matters worse, because it is past the return date I have a big, black, humming piece of junk staring at me. SO FRUSTRATED!!"
5,Sport shade,We bought this product to use for a graduation open house. It set up easily in a 5-10 minutes and survivied a brief down pour of rain. Worked perfectly for our needs.
5,in the shade,"we purchased the coleman 15 ft awning for a graduation party. we loved it, easy to put up, very secure, we did put 2 small 2 by 4's on the legs to get the height up a few inches. i also liked the carry bag and the overall weight is very manageable...looking forward to putting it over a picknic table camping this august!"
4,Good product/sad end,Bought this two and a half years ago and it worked well at the beach and for parties. Easy to set up and sturdy in the wind. Left it up in the back yard this past summer and the Florida sun destroyed the fabric. If only I had taken it down... I recommend it but don't leave it out in the elements for extended periods. I'll be shopping for another and won't be so careless next time.
2,far from expectation,"As a finance student,i thought that i will capture some good ideas,and fascinating stories from a book written by an experienced man in the finance business.Unfortunatly it was not the case the writer did not have any common sense on how to organize the book ,the style of writing was ok Barton Biggs surely knows a lot of fency words,but he lacks organized thoughts.To conclude this book is just flash backs from lunches and dinners that biggs attended ,almost in every page of the book he used [lunch or dinner]meeting ,i never seen his picture before but in my mind he must be 300 pounds"
3,Good but a little dated,"Good anecdotal (diarized) stories about being in the hedge fund industry but they're a little dated (c. 2005) so it's a little confusing to read given statements like ""currently expects/bullish or bearish on..."" with no indication of time which means having to guess. Perhaps the biggest realization from the book for me is just how tough it is to raise assets, even with a great record. An enjoyable and realistic read overall."
1,Great investor; lousy book,"Anecdotal pastiche, no theme, carelessly edited, reads like it was dictated and never revised. Occasional flash of witty prose, but otherwise a vacuum."
4,Entertaining Book about the Hedge Fund Industry,"Barton Biggs offers readers a small glimpse into the world of hedge funds. The book offers an entertaining and basic education on how the world of those mysterious hedge funds works. As a whole it's not a great book for someone looking for a detailed look at the inner workings of the industry, but it does offer an entertaining look into the daily workings and idiosyncrasies of the industry. For those who have worked in the industry Mr. Biggs' attempts to mask the names of some of the more eccentric managers will be in vain as their identities and reputations are legendary in the industry. The book sort of functions as a ""gossip column"" for the industry. I found it entertaining, although the last chapter on John Maynard Keynes was completely out of place with the feel of the rest of the book. I do recommend the book for its entertainment value; those looking for in-depth insights and education about hedge funds will be disappointed."
2,The Big Debarcle,Look the book did touch on the basic ideas of news valus & relationships to simiology etc. but it failed in adiquite explination.The conclusion were equaly febal not really touching on thing like an authors personal idiologies and how they may effect an article.
3,"Fun, but not for long",The battery life on these dies fairly quickly. I got one for my son on Christmas and he enjoyed it for about 6 months. The battery later died and even the manual turn on did not work. Is fixable but a great annoyance.
3,duffy,"a box was buried somewhere inside an old out-of-use house and when everyone seems to be in search for the a token with the information leaked, the problem becomes who will see the dough first and who will inherit it. its another chase thing."
1,A not unusually not unlaborious exercise in MFA not art,"The first 100 pages read like Beavis 'n Butthead do Writing. Huh. Huh huh. Then Kinder shows his stuff, not unlike the not unusual not untalentless nonpeople who spend years sustaining each other on a vague notion they call literary. And he ""teaches"" writing. Oy vay. Why can't he write a simple simile without using a double not for flourish? This book was just plain annoying.That this was a New York Times notable book is clear evidence that the literary/academic complex wants to rule ""art"" in America. Bah."
5,A Project That Confirms I'm a Ginny Owens fan.,"I've been listening to projects by performers I've heard a previous project of. A couple of them have been disappointments, but a couple of others have confirmed that I like the artist. This is an example.I like Ginny's more keyboard based music; most of what I hear is more guitar based, and while I am not complaining, I like the variety. I also like Owen's jazzy sound. The lyrics are also clear enough about her faith to build up my faith.My favorite songs on this project are ""Won't That Be Fine"", ""Call Me Beautiful"", ""Let Them Hear"", ""Ordinary Day"", ""To Trust You"", ""Who Are You Listening To"" and ""I Know Who You Are."""
5,Top notch entertainment!,"Batman-The animated Series Volume one is a great example of what a well throughout quality action series can be. The animation, writing, and overall appearance is fantastic. I highly recommend this series to anyone who appreciates great action and quality animation."
1,It's too dark for kids,"I watch this before and this series is way to dark for childeren both story line, and design of everything that would surely give children nightmares. From bruce loosing his parents, to really pyscho disturbing villians i did not at all like it and don't think kids could handle this even though it says aim for chldren"
5,Perfect!,Couldn't believe the price! Excellent value for a great product! Now to buy the rest of the series! Love it!
1,fell apart,"Although the hardware that holds the whistle, keys, etc. is alright. The clip that holds the lanyard together is inferior and easily allows the cord to come loose. I tried this with 2 of these (they were cheap) to make sure."
2,Robin's Hood,"I like the movie but you'll have to follow the plot to see where it leads, choose it only if your into movies like this."
1,Pretentious....,"This movie tries too hard to be hip and relevant (it fails), and is as subtle as a pipe struck across your head. No artistry at all. The ending credits say it all when it dedicates the film ""to the Ancestors..."" What pretentious new-age tripe."
4,Hubley Collection Volume 2,"Cockaboody is, in my opinion, one of the greatest pieces of animation ever created. Its use of improvised dialogue from the Hubley's two girls is amazing in its representation of a child's mind and imagination. The other short that John Hubley helped animate, Zuckerkandl!, is funny, if a little tedious. The rest--Faith (and Emily) shorts--range from wonderful and playful to tedious and way too out-there. Buy it for Cockaboody, but for a better representation of Faith AND John's work, Art and Jazz in Animation has four hours worth of what is apparently some of the couple's best short (and long) animation."
5,Funnier than Hell,"A whirlwind tour of heaven and hell, or Topside and Below Stairs, as it's referred to in the book. When God/TheDevil/An Alien is put on trial, the author managed to humorously skewer the religous right, the hippies, yuppies, the middle class, and every major religious character out there. Fun stuff."
4,Old school psychobilly.,This is debut album of the first american psychobilly band. The cover is a reworked cover of debut album of the Stray Cats. Production is bad. But songs are good mixture of punk and rockabilly. This is a document of the era.
5,Absolutely beatiful,What a beatiful piece of bass..!It has a Great Sound and also is smaller and lighter than regular fender basses.Perfect for the stage.
4,A good staring package,"What sold me was the fact that i didn't need to change out the batteries every 20 minutes while I was under fire. All I had to do was re-load. the fact that it shoots in auto, semi-auto, and single shot was that their could be fine tune shots, some-what fine tune shots and all out recklessness. (which is very useful.) but than theirs the bullet capacity which is the disadvantage, so i have to reload every 2 minutes when I have it on full-auto . well, enjoy it's very good over all."
1,Incompatible with Windows Vista and 7.,"Do not expect to set this game up without problems. When installing this on Vista, saving crashed my game, and the official forums couldn't help me solve my problem. On Windows 7, Installing Morrowind + the expansions results in a snowflake.nif error, rendering the game unplayable. I ran through the steps on the official forums to rectify the error, after being told to do a manual install of the addons. The only problem is that the folders I was told to extract to do not show up anywhere! This game was so much of a headache to install that I am returning it to Amazon. I am upset that I can't play such a masterpiece because of how old it is."
4,Excellent acoustic,"I'm pretty new to Chris Pureka, but after watching and listening to several videos on YouTube, I decided to give her a try. This is a really nice piece of acoustic work. Lyrics and music are both very good."
5,"Awesome tools, great warranty, great item","I absolutely love these ratchets. I have several of them. The handle is shaped ergonomically to fit your hand. I have several more expensive SK ratchets, but this design is far superior in comfort to your palm. I would recommend this item to anyone. I use it almost everyday. I had one unit that failed and the company replaced it immediately. Great product."
1,Do not buy this. A total waste!,"These are as thin as an aluminum cans and can't support a thing. One of the three pairs I wasted my money on arrived with the top curved into a roll from bouncing around in the box, which contained no other item. Of course it was easily bent back with my fingers to be more or less straight, but you can imagine how well such a ""bookend"" would work. Moreover, the spongy material underneath only serves to help the thing slide out of place more easily. Mine went right to the trash. Look elsewhere for something that works."
4,enjoying it,"CSI:NY seems to have several love interest stories like the regular CSI; I like that (long time soap fan). They also have several ongoing (carryover) plots, like they did with regular CSI, which adds interest and keeps me watching. I at first thought CSI:NY was slightly less gory than the original CSI; not so, but I at least can fast forward through those parts having the dvds. I think the acting is terrific and the characters are interesting. I especially like it when film stars do television work. I have been watching one a day of this series and plan to continue."
5,Great text,Hole's Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology arrived safely in great condition;it is a challenging textbook for 17 year olds but within their reach.
3,Total Chaos,"There's weird stuff going on with these wine glasses. Both the reviews and the price changed between purchase and delivery! I bought 8oz glasses based on a review which said they were blown, not molded; they're molded. Although the box says 11oz, the glasses are, in fact, 8oz (thicker than blown and with a beaded lip). The product description didn't claim that they were blown, so that's my problem. The mislabeling is the manufacturer's, but methinks the seller should have corrected the description."
2,Warranty,The warranty sounds like a good plan but I have not had the opportunity to use the service and can not make an accuracy evaluation at this time.
2,Did not cover the unit,"This coverage only covered the price of the unit when purchased. Which is better than nothing. But they could not repair it, and the purchase price was too low to replace it when the unit died. So it was only worth the credit price of the original purchase."
3,Good while it lasted,"Like some others here, I think this was good while it lasted. Ours lasted 2 and a half years, then broke and remained locked, which, by the way, could be a fire hazard -- especially if it broke when no one noticed and it remained closed, locked and unable to be opened.Now, the latch is permanently riveted to the gate -- for safety. So I called the manufacturer to see about getting just that portion of the gate -- the ""gate-latch side"" -- and was told it's not on their parts list. ""I can request it, but it's not on the list now."" And the woman was clearly not impressed by the request. Obviously they've had a few requests for this part before!First, that's just ridiculous, and second, it's just plain wasteful. Why should we need to replace the whole gate (and put the entire old one in the landfill), just because a little piece of plastic broke in the latch??!!!!!!!??They've got us all suckered in though, because of the holes drilled in our walls!"
2,Great Until It Breaks,"Like so many others have said, this was a great gate right up until it broke. Each time the issue has been the lock freezing in place. We are now purchasing our 5th one in 3 years, the previous 4 having broken after varying lengths of use. Each time a gate has broken we've pondered what to do because we don't want to drill lots more holes for gates that might be equally disappointing, but we dare not go gateless with two toddlers and their not surprising interest in the stairs. Argh!!!"
3,What are you gonna do? Gotta get it.,"Like many, I already have two stairwell entrances w/ this gate hardwired and ready to go. W/o any notice, the spring will pop about 1.5 years in. I have been so proud of the way I cut wood and made it work that I can't see another way. For our set up, this is still about the only option on the market. We are on our 4th or 5th gate 18 months into our second child. If you are already set up, I finally had a ""duh"" moment that you only need to attach the piece w/ the twist handle. I only wish there was a way to only sell that piece. You only need 1/3 of everything in the box to replace the broken spring. It would be nice to only pay for that part. If you already have this, might as well get it; if you are a first timer, consider other options carefully first."
1,GRRRR! Very Frustrating!!!,"I ABSOLUTELY do not recommend this produc to anyone. I have read more bad reviews on this gate than I care to count and they all say the same thing. The locking mechanism gets stuck in the locked position rendering the gate useless! First Years does not stand behind this product when confronted and continues to manufacture and sell this gate knowing that it is dysfunctional. We also found out how unsafe this was when we couldn't get to one of our daughters in her room on the other side of the locked gate. We did, of course, just climb over after a moment, but for a 5 footer like me, that was no easy job. We will be purchasing a new, different gate in the morning. Again, DO NOT purchase this product. I am disappointed that anyone is even still selling it."
4,"great gate, even better for older homes","Our initial purchase of a top-of-the-stair gate was returned to the manufacturer. Of course, we always do a lot of research for safety products so we were a little bummed out to have to start a new search. The problem was not with the gate but with our home. At 90 years old, we have tall, thick, elaborate baseboards. All the gates except for this one do not allow adjusting for the true inch difference from top mount and bottom mount. There was a review written by another person who has the same age house as we do and thank you for that review because it made our decision for this gate a no-brainer. We actually like the gate and it was pretty easy to install. The directions could have been written more simply but we figured it out in about 30 minutes. Very good gate and even better for older homes."
5,Just installed our second gate,"As a replacement for the first one, whose lock froze - apparently a widely reported problem w/ this particular gate. So why give it 5 stars, and why replace the broken gate w/ the same gate? We received the first gate almost exactly 5 years ago as a shower gift, installed it roughly 4 years ago, and it finally broke about 4 days ago - after 4 years of intensive, daily use. Installation is a snap, the gate is very sturdy and secure, and if the second gate lasts as long as the first I'll be extremely satisfied."
1,"Bought 2, and both gates' locks have broken","These gates required drilling into 90-year old woodwork in my house, and lasted less than 6 months before the locks went snarky. Extremely disappointing, to say the least. After the locks broke, they remained barely functional for a while longer (knob would move locking mechanism if turned from one side only, strenuously forcing the knob to turn through a loud thwack-click), but it was a PITA every time, definitely not fun to open with a sleeping child in your other arm..And now finally, one of the knobs has completely popped off. Game over.Stay away from these ... or caveat emptor.For me, replacing them means I'll be patching, repairing and painting over the holes from this one, and then making new ones as I install something else. But, one way or another, I have to install new gates (definitely from some other manufacturer) to get our 2nd child through his stumbling years. They don't call them ""toddlers"" for nothing!"
3,Poor Lock System,"I purchased two of these gates 8 months ago to try to protect my 2 year old from climbing up and down the stairs in our home. Both gates have worked perfectly until the lock mechanism on our top of stair gate broke suddenly. One day while turning to open the gate, I heard what sounded to be a ""spring"" fall out of place inside of the lock mechanism. The gate is now stuck in the lock position. Needless to say, this ""safety gate"" has now become one of the most dangerous things in the house. We litterally have to climb over the gate to get up and down the stairs. I feel that this gate has become a hazard and should be recalled due to the danger this has posed in our household. After reading other review's on this site - It looks as if others are expieriencing the same problems. I am in the process of writing the company to communicate my frustration."
4,Good gate- but hard to open,"I have recently purchased this gate for the top of my stairs. I have mixed feelings about it. It was very easy to install, thanks to the template. The box claimed it was could be opened with one hand. However, I found this to be hard. I have to turn the knob, then use my other hand or my knee to push or pull the gate open. The good thing about this is that my 3 year old can't open it! Also, if you have a hand rail mounted to the staircase wall, make sure to leave enough room between the end of the rail and the gate knob for your hand to move freely. I didn't do this, and it makes it that much harder to open. Like someone else said, I too had to mount the gate slightly out of line due to the location of the studs in my wall, but the gate still does it's job. All things considered, it was still a good buy."
5,Popie just loved it.,My father-in-law just loves his polka CD. Lives in an assisted living facility and recently had his favorite polka channel taken off the air so he loves his new boombox and Polka cd. Best Christmas gift ever!!! Thank you.
5,Love These Cables,These cat6 cables by Cables To Go are great. The sturdy cable housing keeps it tangle free and makes it easy to route. The clips on the ends truly are snag free and are way sturdier than any other cables I've tried. They clip snuggly into my devices and the connection feels tight and sturdy. I bought one of these for a project I was doing but I liked it so much that I threw away all of my cat5e cables and upgraded to cat6. Plus the different colors look cool and help keep things organized.
1,"Not ""Cables To Go"" Brand as advertised.","Disappointing. Advertised as the ""Cables To Go"" Brand. They are NOT. Don't know if its this vendor or amazon. Items can have universal part numbers, such as cables, that are made by many manufacturers. All I can say, I will go to the Cables To Go website, and purchase them directly."
2,Not Cables To Go 27166,Although this is listed as a Cables To Go branded cable (even has the same product number 27166) this is not made by them. It is made by Cabletech Technology. This does not mean that is is bad but I cannot give it a good review since it is totally different than what I thought I was getting.
1,Spring has no tension.,"The spring within the sensor has absolutely no tension. I just opened the box the day before yesterday after having the item sit on my shelf for around a year. I inspected it before installation and I decided that I would rather risk a old Denso sensor from the junkyard than this brand new after market one. Total waste of money, order a different brand or get a used one."
3,Two Incredible Singles,"I know this won't be helpful to many people, but to make this as simple as I possibly can, I bought this CD for two songs. P Control, one of the few Prince tracks that work as ""rap"", and The Most Beautiful Girl in the World, one of the best Prince singles ever. I ripped those two into my MP3 player and promptly shelved the CD, as there wasn't anything else on it that grabbed me. This release apparently wasn't commercially successful - I see it's been taken out of production - but the high ratings I see here make me think I might be missing something. Time to dust the Gold Experience off and give it another spin....?"
5,Required reading for Project Managers,"The stated subject of the book is implementing EPR packages with SAP R/3 software. It deals with the subject matter in great detail and in a very practical manner. The treatment of problems encountered and the ""Lessons Learned"" section of each chapter are particularly well done. Mr. Welti relates these only to the particular project in question. They are, however, applicable to almost any project that involves a change in the company system. For this reason the book is a valuable reference to any project manager. The book is, in my opinion, required reading for every project manager."
4,Very Instructive,"This book takes the reader through an actual European R/3 implementation. It describes in detail the steps and most importantly gives practical ""lessons learned"" in each phase of the project. It is as unbiased a book as I have seen. You should read this BEFORE you select a project integrator, if for no other reason than to keep the consultant honest."
3,In need of an update,"I've been collecting implementation/admin books over the last few months in prep for a large CRM and BW install at a client site. This one is fine from a generic perspective, but needs to be updated if the author expects people to still buy it. I'll stick with Jose Hernandez's admin book, George Anderson's implementation book, and Naeem Hashmi's BW book - the best out there."
5,The Best of the Bradys!!!!,"Well, season 5 has many changes that seperate it from other seasons, mainly because the kids are grown up. Towards the final episodes, Cindy changes her braids, to match her sister's hairstyle. Peter & Mike get fros, Jan becomes hot, and the two youngest get braces. Plus, in the theme song, Carol looks like she jumped into fire pit. Add on Cousin Oliver, and you've got one heck of a season.The episodes have humor that kids can relate to (the first 2 had 60's humor).And the episodes have really good plots, better then the other seasons.All in all, the best season you can buy.SO BUY IT!!!!"
5,Fantastic !! This has to be one greatest works ever!!,"Our Love Song has to be one of Roy's greatest accomplishments!! I don't understand why it never made the charts. Born on the Wind, Love Star, and Say Your my Girl are my favorites. I had this tape back in 1990 when I was deployed to Desert Shield/Storm and would go to sleep every night listening to it."
1,Not so hot after all,"Based on the reviews this book received, I was very excited when I received my copy, only to be extremely let down when I began to read it. Although the story concept is good, the dialogue and over-all writing style, left much to be desired. I would have to guess that this was a ""first-time attempt"" from this author. Perhaps with time and lots of practice, the Queen of Romance will earn her title."
1,Don't Buy this Product with the Aiptek Notepad,"I bought the Acecad Zip Portfolio based upon other reviews and the Amazon suggestion. WRONG MOVE. The Aiptek notepad is larger than the zip portfolio and just won't fit.Nice portfolio, but it won't support the Aiptek Notepad... Save your money and your hair!!!"
1,Yuck,"I purchased this for my son who is a vocalist. It was recommended to help with inflammation. It tastes disgusting. There was no hope of trying to hide it on a cheeseburger or fries, so it went in the garbage along with the aloe vera gel I purchased with it."
2,Oil of Oregano...,Jury's still out on this one; probably because I haven't used much of it yet! I guess I should try it...
3,Mason's Living Books Method Will Bear Fruit,"The profound influence of Charlotte Mason, a dedicated educator of young women in Victorian England, continues to shape the classical home education philosophy of many contemporary parents. During the mid to late 1800s, Miss Charlotte Mason served as headmistress to an ""infant "" school, founded a teacher's college for young women, and wrote numerous books and letters on her philosophy of education. Many parents find the reading of the six volume set entitledCharlotte Mason's Original Homeschooling Seriesto be a tedious but extremely valuable endeavor. When I read the series, I had to read each volume (small spine)over a few weeks so that I could soak up all the valuable advice that Mason teaches.[...]"
5,A Unique Perspectve,Charlotte Mason has and shares many unique perspectives into homeschooling through these books and I am looking forward to actually finishing them!
3,Not Bad English,"I have listened to both of the Bad English releases, and this one is the better of the two. This release is NOT BAD. It's not great, but it's not bad either. The Best Of What I Got, Possession, When I See You Smile and The Price Of Love are all good tunes. The rest are all OK but not memorable.I like John Waite's vocals and Neal Schon on the guitars. Bad English just never really took off after this album. The follow-up has a couple of decent songs, but also nothing really great. If you like Neal Schon's guitar work (without John Waite's vocals), try Double Eclipse by the group Hardline. That is a superb album."
3,"Success is not an accident, good book.","It was good for the first several chapters, then I started to lose interest. Probably mostl my fault. but so it goes."
4,Quality sketching paper,"I've tried a good few sketchbooks, and love the feel of the paper in this one. It feels very smooth and allows for very smooth shading with pencil with no visible texture. The only thing I would urge Bienfang to improve would be adding a harder piece of cardboard as the back cover so it would be easier to use in the field. I can't use this one while (for example) sketching in a park because it bends under it's own weight. It needs to be placed on a flat surface instead of on your knee / etc. Otherwise, it's fantastic quality paper.The paper weight is somewhat light though so you can see the next page through the sheet. When I need to scan a drawing into the computer I just place a regular piece of paper behind the sheet I am scanning and that solves that."
5,"Beautiful, perfect miniature worlds","Each of the poems in this collection contains a beautiful miniature world. Each are absolutely full of surprising yet perfect images, language with an inherent sense of music, and devastating emotional force. The emotional tone of the poems run the gamut, but the poems are hysterical when funny, velveteen when warm, and brutally piercing when sad. I feel haunted by the way that the poems moved me and privileged in how much I enjoyed reading them."
2,"fair system, but not perfect","The first batch of alfalfa sprouts produced great. It does take rinsing at least twice a day. The next go, I used a mix of sprouts I got from a health food store. By the second day, the sprouts were starting to mildew. I threw that out and started over. By day two, again the sprouts were starting to mildew. I have low humidity in my house so I can't figure the problem. Rinsing twice a day is all I can manage because I work away from home. I rinsed real good and left the sprouts uncovered. So far so good, but this system isn't perfect, needs more supervision than I can offer it."
3,Nice but...,"Disc 1 has a Orginization problem. When you do the ""Play All"" feature, it would play the opening and a 12 minute cartoon and no second one like it was aired in 1983. ""The curse of Lan tiki"" had a song replacement as it is stated on the back of the package. No clean up or restoration to the first early episodes or TITLE CARDS for any of the cartoons EXCEPT for the Camep Eagleton Show... What is the deal with that???Disc 2 cartoons are more orginized and left alone in terms of cover songs... Peramount is doing better but they need to get off their duff and get the discs orginized... I hope that paramount gets enough funds to keep the covers in future releases... This would make chipmunk fans really happy..."
5,Boy! Can this man write!!!,"I read Mr. Swigart's great sci-fi novel: ""The Time Trip,"" because I wanted to see how it compared to my own sci-fi novel: ""Time Trip on a Moebius Strip."" Even though his novel was nothing like my own, I was completely amazed by his writing...Can this man write! His story is way out...He has this brillant computer scientist teleported to ancient Mesopotamia, 2642 B.C., looking for his wife who had committed suicide in a microwave oven, believe it or not...He then meets up with his wife in a former incarnation, who doesn't even know him, and who is working as a temple prostitute. She then introduces him to of all people, the king ""Gilgamesh"" who becomes his best friend...They have many adventures together...What happens after that you will have to read the book to find out....If you like sci-fi novels by Kurt Vonnegut, then the novels of Mr. Rob Swigart are right up your alley...."
4,I love it!,"This movie is fun and I LOVE River Phoenix. While this movie would never win Oscars for acting or directing, it certainly is winner if you just want to be entertained..."
2,Boring,Maybe there was some good music in the second half of the movie I don't know because I couldn't watch more than the first half. Hollywood knows nothing about people who have conservative values.
3,A Fine Music-Industry Movie,"If you're looking for a movie about breaking into the music industry, this is a fine one with a country flavor. I like these kinds of movies and I like these specific actors. This is nothing to write home about, but is, well, fine."
3,tempest on tempo,"This recording is very valuable to anyone working with the notations in Choregraphie, regardless of opinions on tempi. However, I am surprised with many of the tempi for the dances and I ask myself, "" How can such basic questions still be in the air after all the research and all the practice of current scholarship and performance?"" Such an important recording as this illuminates the lack of communication among dance practioners in the early dance field."
1,Long sentences.,"This book is very challenging to follow. The sentences are overly long, complicated, with multiple clauses, that I was completely lost by the time I finished on paragraph."
5,A must have CD.,"This is what music is suppose to sound like. When I put this cd on I don't have to worry about skipping over songs, because every track is a must listen to track. The writing and arrangements are first rate, and are not piano heavy, which really highlights Onaje's art of songwriting. This is a classic. BRAVO !!!!!"
5,A gift from Azevedo,"When trajedy strikes, many people draw deeper into themselves. A few rare individuals will allow their emotion to be given as a gift to others in similar turmoil. In clear and blazingly honest language, Marilyn Azevedo shares her experiences as a way of making others feel less alone. Anyone who has suffered loss will benefit from this book, as well as anyone who has ever fought a valiant fight against that which can't be overpowered.This is a beautifully written and worthwhile book, hearbreaking and uplifting in equal measures."
1,A wrong purchase -:(,"V Tech - V.Smile - Finding NemoIt was a wrong purchase and we had to keep it. It probably will end in the garbage very soon, :("
2,3 year old doesn't bother with it,I bought this for Christmas for my 3.5 year old son to add to his other V Tech Games. These V Tech games seem to be hit or miss. This one was a miss.
2,Koo-Koo Ca- CHOO for Gery Hsu,"I'm sorry, Mr Hsu, this book didn't do it for me. the designs were nice and all, BUT too complicated and not exactly well thought out in terms of folding. This book is a total nightmare for the adverage or advanced origami folder. On the upside, if you want to DISCOURAGE someone to the joys of origami, this book is for you!"
3,I just browse through death books.,"This was the tenth album by the prolific Jandek. It sounds a lot like his previous nine albums. The songs consist of Jandek singing and playing acoustic guitar, except he doesn't sing on the instrumental ""Tumblings"" and he also plays harmonica on ""You Didn't Lie"". It's typical early acoustic Jandek. Most people will find this album to be unlistenable, but I kind of like it."
4,Disturbing,"A disturbing book about a woman who wants to become a bird and her amoral lover. Picked by Graham Evans as one of his favorite books of 1998. It's short enough to be read in 1 night if you have insomnia. If you didn't finish, you'll automatically have insomnia until you do. It was probably designed to be read in the bathroom, and that's where I'd leave it."
4,The Great Kimbrell,"This is a great book, although it is rather short. I read it a few times. I went to one of his readings at a local university and he is a great guy, his poetry is well written, it is not five star work yet."
5,Great and very portable,"We bought this for our family vacation with our one year old. It sets up pretty quick, has a nice carrying case and is built really well. I would highly recommend getting one of these for any family outing at the beach."
4,Great beach tent but hard to get together in the wind,"This beach tent was really easy to put together when there was little to no wind. During a windy day at the beach, it really takes more than 1 person to put together because it catches the wind and wants to take off. Other than that it was great for the beach to keep my wife, baby, and I out of the sun. With the front open, 3-4 adults can lay inside easily. With the front closed, probably only 2 adults and a child can fit comfortably. Fabric and design seem to be high quality. For the price, it is a tough deal to beat!"
2,over an hour to put up,It took two of us over an hour to put up. Instructions poor and someone on the beach had to help us that new how to put it up. One of the poles snapped and broke while ripping the meshing so we ended up renting an umbrella. I will probably throw in the garbage.
2,Not a quick set up.,"Although it says it's a beach tent, it takes some time to put the rods together and figure out where they go. When I go to the beach, I don't want to spend the first 15 minutes setting up a shelter. Instead, I purchase a pop up type that only takes about 15 second to set up. Returning it to Amazon was no problem."
5,love this beach shelter,"Our family of 4 brought this beach shelter to Maui last week and used it at the Black Rock. It was hot and we really liked having the Coleman quality (we have a Coleman camping tent) and ease of setting up/taking down the shelter. And not to mention, we didn't have to spend $$$ and hassle with reserving cabanas or umbrellas."
3,doesn't fit some eyepieces.,"It will not connect to a 40mm Celestron eyepiece. It does however connect directly to the telescope. If there are multiple thread designations, as it appears, it would be nice to know all of the ones it does not fit."
3,Like most souvenirs - neat but often misplaced.,"I read this book in two sittings. The photograph compositions where clever and did evoke familiarity - good and bad - about Canadian images and icons. Coupland's ramblings though, are insights that I believe all Canadians feel or have felt at least once in their lives. Ironically I think this book would have the greatest resonance with non-Canadians, although judging by the few American reviews posted, this suggestion may prove to be a stretch."
4,detailed instructions,If you are a beginner or an advanced illustrator I recomend that your library would not be seen without this book. The detailed descriptions really make it easy because they are so simple to follow. You can see your own progress in just a few hours by using the simple techniques listed in this book. I highly recomend this book.
5,The best on the subject,When reading James Walker's book I was struck by it's honesty and hard-hitting style. It's like he had been an uninvited guest in our home for many years. His book deals with Male passivity and how women go crazy when they feel like they are carrying the whole load. He also gives practical suggestions on how to save your marriage along with your sanity. When I read it I wanted to colapse and breathe a huge sigh of relief.
1,Great... for a very short time,"This drive worked very well for a short time ~100 days. I used it to back up my systems. The plug kept falling out of the back of the drive. It caused several problems with the drive.This ""drive"" actually has two hard disk drives in it. Currently I have managed to get one of them to work again, but that means that I only have 500GB of space, not that its not a lot of space, but I paid for 1TB.I will be buying theLaCie Big Disk Extreme+ 301199U 1 TB USB 2.0/FireWire400/FireWire800 RAID Systemas I have had good results form the ones that I purchased for the systems where I work.Overall, this drive is cheap, but you get what you pay for."
5,Wonderfully Offbeat,"As the title indicates, love as many aspects! As this book demonstrates, even the most unlikely have encountered some form of love."
1,Shipping Problems,This product was not purchased in the end. The book would have been ideal but shipping costs at $US 30.00 made it an unrealistic purchase. The shipping was 4 times the book cost
2,I think this book is not as bad as these people say!!!,"This is a very good Book for beginers, In my case all I have learned about VB is in this Book. Very easy explenations, easy to understand and good examples. The bad thing about this book is that it has many errors and also it does not explain too much about Data Programing, but as it says it is a book for beginers."
2,"Great Startup book, but index does not reflect correct pages","I think that this would be an exellant book to get startedon Visual Basic. I found it easy to read and understand.Unfortunately, the index does not show the correct pagesfor the topic or subjects that you want to reference back to.I have read Mr. Perry's C/C++ books and they were great.The publisher / editor's should have caught this!If you have a photographic memory, this is the book if foryou. If you want to refer back to something and find itin a pinch, forget it!"
5,Great!,I love this wash mitt! I couldn't find it at my local store anymore... I'm glad Amazon was available to help...
4,Great book but...,"This book could have been shorter. There are a lot of succint summaries that do a good job in highlighting the main ideas of the book. But its light read, with lots of examples.BTW the chasm analogy does not apply to Microsoft, apparently the they are an example of the ""Evel Knievel"" strategy...."
4,Good book for entrepreneurs,"My class professor highly recommended this book. He called it ""the best business book I have ever read."" Although, I don't share his enthusiasm, the book is interesting enough for me to get through it. People who are interested in marketing new high-tech products can learn a great deal from this book."
2,Too Many Obsolete References,"While I found the first 20 or so pages of this book helpful in a general sense, the author made too many references to obsolete or no long existant software companies. Result: If you weren't in high tech in the 90's you might not get much from the examples."
2,Old News,"Doesnt seem relevant at this time . If you think about computer software changes they are like dog years, every year they (used to ) advance 7 years so old information is irrelevant. Google Panda and Penguin are what you need to pay attention to now."
2,dated material,"It was good in its day, but it is very dated material and now just seems to be common place knowledge."
5,History in the making,"This book is essential to anybody interested in NZ history, and History in general. It is wonderfully written and summarises a detailed history of NZ very well. Highly recommended."
5,The Very Best From A Distinguished Career,"If you do want the very best and only the very best, it's all right here and most of the songs sung so outstandingly were written by Roy himself either in partnership with Joe Melson or Bill Dees. The touching Christmas tune, ""Pretty Paper"" was written by Willie Nelson and ""Dream Baby"" and ""Shahdaroba"" by Cindy Walker who wrote many-a country tune including Jim Reeves' ""Distant Drums"" (which Roy covered). These songs as done by Roy Orbison touch the emotions in a way that only a relative few can. These are priceless. Also Roy took Elvis Presley's rousing 1957 hit, ""Mean Woman Blues"", and made it his own in 1963. After some years off the charts as a solo artist, Roy was on his way to making a new round of hits with his magnificent voice when he died in December 1988. The songs in this package are from his best years on the charts."
5,WOW!!,"WOW! so what if I am only 13, Roy Orbison is the all time greatest singer and my favorite. When I was 3 or 4 my dad would always play this cd for me. it is the best!! If you love Roy, you'll love this!"
5,I agree.,"This is an excellent introduction to Roy Orbison's music. Bought this CD for ""Blue Bayou"" and ""Crying"" - songs that an old cousin used to sing, and found myself jamming to the rest of the the collection. Then I discovered the ""Black and White Nights"" dvd at a New Year's Eve party 6 years ago. That DVD you gotta own. Very cool, with Bruce Springsteen, KD Lang, Bonnie Rait, and other big names in the music industry. It is one you will not mind watching again."
5,Great story,I knew of the Sentry from Dark Reign and Siege and then I heard about this book. It's a great book with a great story. The story is pretty unique for super hero comics and includes several characters from the Marvel universe. It really helps you understand The Sentry and makes him a much much more interesting character.
4,Jenkins and Lee rule !!!,"This book is second only to their Inhumans. It is about a guy who remembers his past life as a hero and it seems nobody else remembers him.If you buy books for art, this one has : Jae Lee, Mark Texeira and Bill Sienkiewicz!!!!"
2,Promised much-delivered little.,"At first, the thought of Paul Jenkins and Jae Lee doing a ""long lost"" Marvel classic character makes your mouth drool with anticipation. However the cold reality of it's execution soon brings with it the crushing realazation that we are reading something that I as a comic book fan have read a million times. Nothing new here! Nice Jae Lee artwork though."
5,"Wonderfully evocative ""torch"" singing","When I listen to this recording, I am transported to another time and place - a nightclub in the fifties. I am sitting at a candlelit table at a restaurant looking at the face of my love and Lucianne is standing at baby grand piano singing. She is dressed in a long sensual gown with short curling hair and high heels. We used to call her singing ""torch singing"" and I love it. Please do another!"
5,Awesome,Went ski doo'ing on the ocean for a cruise excursion. Could see everything without salt water in my eyes. Thank you.
1,not safe at all,"I bought this seat for my 11 month old son and I am taking it back before I even put him in it. While trying to put it together the back and seat of the chair fell out several times despite having them secured in the slots provided. I can only imagine how it would hold up with my 21 lb. son in it, let alone the 50 lb. weight limit that it claims. Also because of where the chair straps are positioned, it did not attatch securely to our kitchen chair because only the lower part of the seat was attatched to the chair and the top was allowed to move. My husband and I both tried securing the straps at tight as we could get them and there was still enough give that the seat could be wiggled off the side of the chair."
2,Doesn't grow with baby!,"My son started using this booster with the tray when he was around 10-12 months. It was ok then. However, this booster didn't conthas been using this booster didn't grow with him. By the time he was 12 months, he could kick up and pop the tray off. Also, it is not very sturdy on the chair. When we took the tray off, he used the hole where the tray attached to stick his spoon and food. I liked the featured that allowed us to move the seat up so that he would be more even with the table, BUT and this is a BIG problem. It would not stay secure. A little wiggling by the end of the meal and the seat part would pop out of the sides of the chair and fall back down to the chair seat. Dangerous and kind of scary for my toddler. I'm buying a new seat today!"
2,"Problems with seat ""popping"" out of base unit.",I purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so. I have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units. The sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem. Weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that.I would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them.
1,what were they thinking,"this idea is nice but, the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap. next the tray is hard to get off and wash. next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray, and that is really hard to get off, by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash.unless you are super woman i would not buy"
4,Wonderful!,"I am shocked to see all those who have had problems with this chair. We've had it for almost a year already and have not had any of the problems mentioned in other reviews. One of my sons just figured out (at 20 months) how to take of the tray, but I don't see that as a hazard as he is strapped in and I am also sitting right next to him.I find the swing tray to be very useful when trying to put one of them in the chair with one hand."
2,Not the best booster,"If I do it again I would not buy this booster. There is a hole in the arm rest that is used to attach the tray to the booster. When you are not using the tray there is nothing to cover the hole. Therefore, my son loves to put his food and eating utensils down the hole. It is not easy to clean since the booster is attached a the chair. I would highly recommend buying the Grow With Me - Portable Booster Seat By Safety 1st. We have an older child that had this booster and it was wonderful. I wish we had bought it again."
3,Grey stuff around the shaft,"I used my breadmachine for 5 months, everything worked fine. The problem started last week, after kneadling the bread dough, there was some grey stuff found inside at the bottom of the pan, around the shaft. I guess it is lubricating oil. The paddle look fine to me, no scratch. I didn't cook the dough which had touched the gray stuff. I didn't use my breadmachine since then."
1,Lots of non-stick chemicals,Directions say to run the express bake before baking bread in it. OMG the fumes filled our entire house. They made me so sick. I had to unplug it and put it outside. There is no way I am going to use that machine. I have never experienced this with other non-stick appliances. If you are sensitive to the off-gasing of chinese products.....DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE!!!! So toxic!
3,Fast and Fun,"Makes great bread, takes up little counter space. It took a few tries to get the desired results but worth the effort. The manual could be a little more user friendly, but overall a good product for the price."
4,Bread Maker,"I use this constantly as I am always making sour-dough rolls (must feed starter every two weeks) and my neighbors and church like the various breads I make. I do have to be sure and correctly indicate whether I want to make bread or just dough (for rolls) and sometimes it is very hard to read the yellow so I keep my book handy to refer to it for the various selections (crust, weight, process, etc.) All in all though for the price it is very satisfactory (I have gone through four bread machines so far and will find out how long this one will last)"
5,We haven't bought any bread from Supermarket for over a year.,"This bread machine rocks! Since buying it, we have been baking our bread weekly. As it doesn't even need kneading the bread with sticky hands.One important fact though, you can't really follow the instruction manual. You will need to use your basic knowledge of the reaction of flour, yeast, salt, sugar and water to make good bread. It will be nice if the instruction of the machine is clearer with easily to follow steps to make good bread. We have to try a couple of times to fine-tune our process."
1,NOT FOR ME!,"I have used several different breadmakers in the past, but this is by far the worst of them. Since my previous units were old, I thought this would be a new and better one. Not so. I thought the instructions were more difficult than before, but the biggest problem is trying to read the control panel. I am short anyway, so then I stand on my tiptoes to read the panel, and I stil can't see it because it's white on yellow! Even setting it down to a shorter height didn't help much-still had to squint to read it. On top of that, my first loaf was just a simple white loaf, but it turned out much too heavy and dry, although I followed the instructions explicitly. This is going back, and now think it might be better to spend a little more and go for a different brand."
4,Breadman TR520,"Good machine, have to stir in the flour sometimes in order to make sure all ingrediants get mixed. Owners manual very useful."
5,Breadman TR250 Programmable Bread Maker,"I was steered to this brand by a co-worker, who has had his for 20+years and loves it. As our family members all like different breads, making smaller loaves seemed less wasteful and more economical with bread costing almost $3. a loaf now. Your price plus free shipping was the decider and upon receiving my Breadman, I was thrilled to see a varied(but not too large or difficult)recipe book included and found it easy to follow. In fact, my 25 year old daughter also tried several recipes and uses it regularly now too."
3,"Good machine, but..","I've only made dough in this machine so far, and it does a good job. My complaint is with the program panel. White letters on pale yellow background are hard to read! Wish there was more contrast."
3,Jury is still out,The bread doesn't raise as well as it did in my old bread maker. I am using the recipe that came with the Breadman which may be the problem. I am going to revert to my old recipe to see if re-calibration of ingredients makes a difference. Otherwise it seems like a very good product.
4,"Much better design than old Breadman, buttons are hard to read","My old Breadman gave up the ghost after 3+ years of at least weekly use. I ordered this new one and am very happy about the updates from the older model. First, the bread pan looks to be coated with something far more durable than the old pan (which easily scratched) and the paddle is much easier to insert. The pan is wider now (and not as deep) which seems to make it much easier for the machine to mix the dough. The unit is bigger now, but the only minor complaint is the buttons (as others have noted). They really are difficult to read. The menu has changed a bit from the old Breadman--this one has fewer options, but those that have gone won't be missed. All in all, for the money, a solid product."
3,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?,What were they thinking when they designed the front panel??? WHITE on YELLOW is horrible!!!I cannot believe this bread machine was released to the public like this. It is not readable!! The only way I am able to make bread is to look at the picture in the manual to see the wording on the front panel. This machine makes excellent bread but I cannot give a 5 star rating because of the WHITE on YELLOW unreadable front panel. The least could have done was to send out a plastic overlay in black print.
4,Fun game.,"I like this game. I would recommend it to nerdy families like mine. Not really, but...It really is fun. There are strategies that make it funner. It is fun for adults and my 15 year old cousin. Can play in teams or individually. Each game only takes 20-30 minutes. Pretty fun."
4,Fun Game,Picked this up for our kids for Christmas. They are both teenagers and the entire family likes the game. Going to take it to family party today and see if others like it as much.
5,The Best of Roy,The great voice of Roy is represented here in this album. A wonderful collectioins of Roy Orbison's best recordings in full stero.
1,Mastering Multiplication Tables,"Our experience with this software has been extremely unsatisfactory. It is boring and I have a very difficult time forcing my son to ""play"" with it. There has to be a better way. I've never given a negative review. This is a first."
5,Great!! this pickup is fantastic,I put this into a 1963 guild d40. For the price I am impressed. super clear well balanced tone coupled with a LR Baggs di box this pickup is great!
3,Nice Shirt,"These shirts are nice enough. They seemed to shrink in the width of the body more than any other direction. My son is thin and I was surprised that we struggle to get these on. Once on, they are fine, a bit snugger than I would like, as kids where things looser these days; there is no room to put a short sleeve shirt under this one for a layered look. I give these shirts only a 3 rating because AFTER purchasing and wearing these, I found Hanes brand long sleeve t-shirts which I like much better. They seem a bit higher quality, and definitely looser fitting in the body and arms, and easy to fit a tshirt underneath, making this long sleeve t shirt able to function as a light swart shirt if wanted. Hanes shirts provided more length in the sleeves and trunk. Rabbitskins are a much more fitted cut and great if that is what you are looking for.Hanes shirts are also tagless - a big plus for my 3 year old."
4,Good purchase,"This shirt was a great purchase for the price. Cheap, but well made. We used it for Halloween under my 2.5 ye old's Mr. potato head costume, and again for a Christmas program at church where my son was a sheep. Very durable shirt."
5,Mickey Baker's Jazz Guitar,"Been playing since 1968, self taught, by ear and have wanted to play more than just the same old patterns. This book is great for us intermedates. [...]MJ"
5,Great book!,Book is huge! It has so much information from every Mystery season. Anyone who grew up in the 80's and 90's with PBS Mystery must buy this.
2,Christy Lane's Let's Do Ballroom!,"The music selection wasn't as ""danceable"" as we had hoped. Very difficult to get the beat to the salsa and waltz. The Hustle was a very poor arrangement."
1,"Dull, Boring and Slow Moving","i purchased this book after hearing an NPR critic say this was an excallent book on the west and buffalo. Unfortunately it is not. It is long, over 700 pages. The story is slow moving, the characters are not very real and the interconnection betwee characters is odd. I finished the book only becuase i thought it had to become better, more like the sales pitch on the back cover. Alas, another consumer rip off."
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"Like a lot of people, I imagine, I've had a hard time getting into reading anything lately. By chance, I picked up Julie Ortolon's DEAR CUPID and found myself quickly immersed in this big-hearted, sexy-sweet romance. I was so immersed, in fact, that I read it--okay, devoured it!--in one sitting. DEAR CUPID is fun, fast-paced, and irresistibly romantic. Thanks for a lovely escape from reality, Ms. Ortolon! I've just put you on my auto-buy list."
5,Love Love Love Julie's books,"Love ""Dear Cupid"". They spellbind you into the story and you can not put the book down..Great Job. Keep 'em coming."
4,Heart-breaking true story,"I've always been fascinated by this specific time period and by the mystery of what happened to Louis XVII. This book is extremely well written and well put together. The pacing is good. At times, it can almost feel like fiction. Maybe that's also because it's so awful to think of so much of what is described as being true. I didn't expect to react so emotionally to the content. But the description of what happened to the little (8 year old) boy is so horrifying that I couldn't help crying at the thought. It's very hard to understand how human beings can treat other human beings--especially children--in such horrible ways. But the truth is that it's an important story that needs to be told. Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI are fascinating characters and this story shows how much they loved their children. I recommend it to any history fanatics out there."
3,For the Phoenixphile only.,"You want this only if you are an unabashed fan of River Phoenix. It offers little else than some interesting text and a ton of photos of River in the last year or two of his life (he died at age 23). What's disappointing is that it is not a photo biography of the subject. This title merely collects a bunch of really great magazine cover type photography. Everything is staged. What we don't get, and what just does not really exist for River, is a chronicle of his career and his exuberant personality -- in photos. I mean, get real. The kid was really handsome and charismatic. The only serious works on him are two biographies of dubious value. I had hoped that this book would be an album of his life, something, perhaps that would explain his death. That's a tall order, I know, from a photo book. But for all true River Phoenix fans, that's what we want. An answer to why he's gone. Of course, this book doesn't provide one and doesn't try. It's just got a ton of great pictures."
3,A good book,"This book is nicely laid out and perfect for a couple who have been together for a while. It is not good for couples where one member is a step-parent. Also, the pictures are representative of an older generation and don't necessarily fit with my parents' generation. It was more appropriate for the great-grandparents of my baby, though it was aimed at 'grandparents'."
4,Pleasantly surprised ending,"I didn't expect this book to be interesting, I had just purchased it for the pictures to use in my art work. But, I was pleasantly surprised. It's sort of a ""kooky"" guy on a quest to find an island, and it turns out that with the pictures provided it's an interesting book. I purchased another book so I can cut out the pictures, and will re-read this one and keep for my library."
4,And then it all falls apart...,"It's funny how you find certain music. For instance, I found HURT because I was bored of what I have on my iPod, so I checked out iTunes for different new bands, and voila! Vol. 1 is a dynamic and emotional album. Some songs may jump out at you when on your first listen, but this album is one that takes a few listens to appreciate it's power. J. Loren has quite a set of pipes on him. His voice is the true gem of this band. The music is interesting and good, but his voice is what will carry this band. These guys can't really be pegged into a specific niche, other than falling under the large umbrella of rock. Personal favorites are the aforementioned ""House Carpenter"", ""Rapture"", ""Forever"", ""Danse Russe"", ""Unkind"", and ""Falls Apart"". If you're looking for some good new rock music, this is up your alley."
2,A bit too soft for my liking,"I was quite disappointed with this CD, it kept coming up in searches as a hard rock CD, and although occasionally it does build to some heavy moments they are few and far between. What is even stranger is when i ripped it to my itunes the genre said Heavy Metal. As i said when it does get heavy it sounds fantastic its just that it doesn't happen much. Far too much wishy washy soft atmospheric stuff, found myself getting very bored waiting for some heavier moments. In the end its too hard sitting through all the soft stuff for the sparse heavy moments."
4,Hurt,This is album is sick. At first I thought this might be one of those bands that would fade into obscurity once the first single was released. Boy was i wrong. This is the new face of rock.Top SongsFalls ApartLosingForeverHouse CarpenterDanse RusseOverdose
3,"Not 5, not 1 - good movie, bad tranfer.","I'm a Boater and this film goes over the top and makes me laugh out load (LOL). But 5 stars as the greatest movie of all time? Sorry, LOL. I agree about the Disney rip off. They really should put out a quality product. I've got a whole wish list on Amazon as # 5 - don't buy for me, waiting for a better transfer to happen before I buy them. Mostly from Disney! Disney, if your listening, don't worry about the next generation of this sale being widescreen. The next generation will be HD and then it will be HD on 3"", etc. So Disney, you have lot of future releases available too make your money. If you still have customers! Until then, I guess I watch my VHS one more time."
5,From a mexican Roxy Music fan,"Definitely Avalon in one of my top 10 albums ever; this SACD version is amazing. I have listened to the remastered album thousand of times, but believe me, listening to the SACD album is another dimension and a whole new experience.All the sonic treatments, a Roxy Music trademark are just wow!!!Best regards to the fans,Jose Curiel from Mexico City"
5,New version of a Roxy classic,"As an ardent fan of Roxy Music since their earliest days, I was looking forward to hearing what the SACD format would add to the original.To be honest, I have only a little SACD format discs to play on my Sony player, but this is by far the best.For any Roxy fan who still have their vinyl copy, this version gives so much more, it's a very worthwhile buy!"
2,An overly simplistic look at economics and life,"I found The Invisible Heart to be a preachy, simplistic book. I like the idea of writing an economic romance/fiction, but I was quickly bored with the stereotypes and predictability. Packaged as a thoughtful look at contemporary society and economics, to me it read like an update of Ayn Rand, without the quality of her story-telling. I was hoping for a Sophie's World, and was disappointed. Even the ""twist"" felt gimmicky and fell short."
3,good show!,"Great show - stays mostly true to sonic, with a twist. the new-age anime style that is popular now has invaded the world of sonic's animation style, but it is decent and not that over-the top style that is annoying. Do be aware of backorders and might not play on every dvd player, mine plays on most drives i have put it into. Enjoy another good spin on the sonic universe"
1,Terrible,"I bought this watch twice. The first one is excellent andthe next one was defective. It did not work at all. I called Mister Watch On Line, the place where I bought it and I was told that Wenger does notmake this watch anymore. Its an old model--old watch. It cost me some money to have it fixed--dont buy this kind anymore--you get the old and left over."
5,Wenger Value -- Impossible to Beat,"I now own several Wengers and have nothing but praise for them. There is no other watchmaker, in my opinion, whose quality of fabrication and choice of movement (swiss eta) is as robust for the money as Wenger. Regardless of price, in fact, these watches can't be beat for either accuracy or reliability. I personally don't pay full retail for anything, but Wengers are actually worth their stated msrp, not something you can say about most watch brands."
4,Bigger than I thought,This is a Wenger - good quality and more than I anticipated. These are excellent everyday comfortable watches.
4,Inspiring story,"It becomes clear that Joe's involvement in the Viet Nam War completely turned his life around. He was an unmotivated teenager who drifted in and out of public and private schools, never achieving much success academically or socially. When he decided to join the military, he found a calling. He matured as a person and realized that he was a natural leader. He had a distinguished military career and later success in business. This book is a compelling autobiography."
3,"Good man, lacking story","The story is about a man who went from a poor to rich family. Thus, he had trouble fitting in and wasn't amounting to much. He decides to join the military and try to find himself. He gains confidence as he learns not to quit and eventually becomes an officer. He shows to be a capable platoon leader and only loses one man, which he regrets. He definately cared about his men in Vietnam, that is for sure. Like many men in his situation, he didn't want to get out because the army was his sole identity and only success thus far. The rest of his time was out of the bush and he just saw more men he knew die off. He never faced the true horrors some did, yet he spends the last half of the book dwelling over the past. I do think that the author gives a good history and overall picture of Vietnam. Lt Callaway would have been a great man to serve under, but his story lacks substance."
1,"Series Win, Packaging Fail. Spend the extra and buy seasons each",The packaging for this seemed like a great idea when I was ordering it. The shag carpet on the box was a cute touch. The box set arrived today and the first disc I attempted to pull out stuck to the glue and then when it finally gave way it was covered in the glue. The next disc did the same thing and so on and so on. Every single disc is coated with the glue from the packaging making them impossible to play. I've requested UPS pick up and my money back.
5,Very pleased,"I am very pleased with the purchase. Yes, the package is a little flimsy and the dvd's can fall out if you aren't careful. There wasn't any sticky residue on the dvd's as I previously read about and NONE were scratched."
1,unhappy,This product was packaged terrible so that glue got on the dvd's and the first one won't play. For the price I feel it should be replaced.
5,Bring back the memories,"I purchased this collection for my 11 year old daughter, but my wife and I have really enjoyed watching all of the episodes too. Its kind of funny that after 30 years you can still remember the story line. It's a great collection and it will bring back many memories."
5,Simple design that fills the need,"A lantern in camp is a wonderful thing, if you've got a place to put it. Preferably, the lantern will be above your head so it can give the greatest amount of light, and away from people who might bump into it and tip it over. This little device allows you to wrap the length of chain around a nearby tree trunk and then hang you lantern high enough to do the most good. It's also a handy hanger for your wet towel during the daylight hours. Just make sure that there aren't any combustable materials (read dry branches) too close overhead. You don't want to use your lantern to start a fire!This is one of the must have items that doesn't add any weight to your packing, but really adds a lot of convenience. I recommend this to anyone who uses a lantern."
5,Simple and brilliant,Very easy to hook around a tree. I have hung both propane and kerosene lanterns. The kerosene lantern is obviously heavier but this hanger held it with zero problems. One of my must have camping items when I take the family camping.
1,boxxy Night,The Screen saver is a Astromomy trip on your computer only problem is it takes place in a tiny ugly box on your screen.the stars and planets are all in a ugly customizable box that spins on your screen looks ugly and sitn amusing at all.insted of the entire screen be a beutyfull Space Stary night its in a small box.Ugly and sad I wasnt at all happy
5,High Yield,"I used this book in addition to the Kaplan series. I felt this was ideal in the week prior to the exam, and was superior to first aid. There are several mistakes in the text, but between this text and kaplan I crushed the exam. I would not recommend this text to anyone who is weak in pharmacology!"
5,Fun Fur Mice,"My cats absolutely adore these mice. They go crazy over them. The only problem I have is that the cats keep losing them. I don't know where they all end up, but I'm sure I'll find them someday. I should have ordered more of these. I say give these mice a try."
3,Not as pictured,"This pack of mice was not exactly as pictured or described. Mice were of different sizes (some you could call rats!), different colors (blue!), but worst of all, not all were covered in rabbit fur as promised. That last discrepancy was the most disappointing! My cat is totally uninterested in polyester mice. Misleading description."
2,Not the best quality- Photo misrepresents product,"First off, the photo misrepresents the product. The photo shows only SMALL mice.What you actually get are some small mice, then about 3 LARGE ""mice"" which look like rats! My cat did not like the rats and would not play w/them. Also, the fur on some of the mice are fake and low quality compared to other mice I have bought in past."
2,Fur Mice not a hit,"These were advertised as the original fur mice. They are not. My cat, who loves the originals, won't touch these. So, they went to the mousie animal shelter."
1,Great Dissapoinment,"I had the greatest expectations about reading the book, but it's really a complete dissapointment. Conclusions are so obvious that can be done at the first pages- The Sion Priorate it's an invention of Mr. Placard-. If you're looking for something in the Da Vinci Code line, DON'T buy this book, it's a waste of money."
3,too thin,"These pajamas are supposed to be ""brushed back satin"" but there is not much to the material. They are comfortable, but not what I would consider brushed back satin. For years I would buy at least one set around the holidays, and now you can't find them anywhere. Thought I would give these a try and I am not that impressed."
3,Excellent feeling PJ's,"I love these pajamas, but I bought the large, and the waist is pretty tight. It may keep me from wearing them as much as possible. I am 66 and homebound and really wanted something to wear all the time during the winter. Bought about 5 sets."
2,NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CARAVAN (UK BAND),"BE AWARE! This recording has nothing to do with the UK Band CARAVAN (i.e. Richard Coughlan, Pye Hastings, David Sinclair, Richard Sinclair). This is a live recording, bootlegged during a rock festival in Belgium in 1985 by a band which uses the name Caravan (probably taken by Morrison's same-titled song). The CD inner sleeve has no info at all. Nice interpretations but why should anyone buy this, while the original recordings by Van Morrison are thousand times better by far..."
3,THANKFULLY IT'S SMALL,"Having read lots of Harlan Ellison's collections, I can honestly say that this one is not one of his best. You won't find any Hugo-award winners in here, folks. Of course, I've read LOTS of Harlan stories that DIDN'T win awards and were absolutely WONDERFUL. There is one such story in this collection that comes to mind--Erotophobia. Remember the opening scene of Austin Powers? Where he's being chased by all these women. That's the basic idea for that story. Absolutely hilarious. As for the rest of the stories in this book, I didn't find any that were Harlan at his worst. Even the story Catman, the longest and least enjoyable of the bunch had a little something to it. I wouldn't recommend that first time Harlan-readers start here, though. But for those of us that have read our Harlan, this is definitely worth getting."
3,good but not durable (??),"The product is good but after 30 minutes of using, it stopped working... This is frustrating because I have to return it (and I am just here in the US for a short vacation)...I hope that I will get the replacement within the week (before my scheduled departure)..."
5,Love it!,"I was skeptical about upgrading my epilady...but no fear; this epilady is wonderful. I was ready for all the pinching and pulling as it used to be from my old model, but noooo....this one is smooth as butter. It is painless and does not cause as much dryness and rash as my old model used to. For a minute I thought it was not working! But it works so beautiful that I did not even realize it was doing its work. I am an epilady user for over 15 years and this Epilady Legend is great! I just wish the charger was a little lighter to make it easier during travels."
3,Print is big...,"I ordered it because print is big but this print is really, really big. Therefore, there aren't a whole lot of pages. It would also be more comprehensive if it had lines for land line and cell phones."
3,this toy stinks.,"I bought this thinking it would be cool. it sort of is,but is is so hard to put together to do.Lego soccer is so much easier to put together.I havn't played with it yet. im still putting it together.I bought it 3 days ago, and im still not finished."
3,GOOD!,"I BOUGHT THESE FOR EXPANDING MY ALESIS DM5 E-DRUM SET, IT IS CLEAR THAT IT IS MADE FOR ION DRUMS BUT I DECIDED TO BUY THEM ANYWAY AND I INSTALLED IT AND WORK VERY WELL WITH MY DM5 MODULE. GOOD PADS! ANOTHER GOOD THING IS THAT HAVE THE VERY SAME APPERANCE OF DM5 PADS SO IT LOOKS AS ORIGINAL PADS."
5,These Drums Are Great,"These Ion-Audio drum sets are wonderful. I can't believe all of the bad reviews I've seen on them. These drum pads are just like the one's that come with the complete sets (except for the rocker kit). They came with the mounts,and needed cables. I love these drums!"
5,Hard to compare,"Beauty And The Beat is such a great album that it stands alone. But Vacation is still a great album. My personal favorite is 'He's So Strange.' I don't know how it was made but it did not sound like it was 'rushed' out. The concept is wonderful, tongue in cheek with the group waterskiing together. They always have a good sense of humor."
3,"not bad, but not great","'vacation' misses some of the energy and fun of the other releases. the overall sound is of a 50's beach movie soundtrack and there are a few classics (beatnik beach, cool jerk) but this cd still runs in third place behind the other two."
4,The perfect beach memory music,"Hot of the heels of Beauty and the Beat, the Go-Go's quickly released 1982's follow-up Vacation. Propelled by the top ten singles, Vacation and Get up and Go, the Go-Go's seemed to shy away from their humble beginnings and began to play to a different audience. The record buying audience.Unlike Beauty which had a somewhat gritty feeling, Vacation sounds too polished. With such tracks as The Way You Dance, This Old Feeling and He's So Strange, Vacation seemed to cater to a different beat. Grittier tracks include: Beatnik Beach, a remake of Cool Jerk, Everything But Partytime and Girl of 100 Lists.I am not saying the album is bad by any means, it just shows that perhaps they should have taken some time inbetween releases to refocus.Vacation stands as one of the premiere 80s tracks and this album, although better than some 80s pop just doesn't live up to expectations. Try Talk Show where they revisited their roots or try Beauty and the Beat and see where it all began."
3,A strange compromise between Fleming and the Bond films,"John Gardner's Bond books, if ""Icebreaker"" is any indication, aim for a compromise between the classiness of Ian Fleming's stories and the bombast of the film series. The plot is relatively straightforward, as 007 travels to the Finland/Soviet border to track down an international neo-Nazi conspiracy, without any of the tired, obligatory globetrotting of the latter-day films. ""Icebreaker's"" cartoon-like villain, however, seems reminiscent more of the movies than the Fleming novels, and the story climaxes with the big explosions required of the films as well. Gardner's own contribution to this mix is the conflicting loyalties among the characters. Agents turn out to be double-agents, then triple-agents, as someone turns traitor in almost every chapter. The novel as a whole, thus, is an uneasy combination of these three elements that reads quickly and enjoyably, but it's kind of hard to recognize James Bond in there."
5,Excellent Volume,"Dr. Veith's works are always thought-provoking and insightful...and this volume is no different. Veith provides valuable guidance from Scripture and his experiences for Christians as they interact with the world around them, especially the intellectual world. I plan on utilizing this book in teaching Christian involvement and interaction, living out one's vocation, with the world and for developing an active apologetic model for everyday use. Great read. Well worth the price and time."
3,Alice's Sex Album,"Having gone the horror route with CONSTRICTOR and RAISE YOUR FIST AND YELL,Alice Cooper decided that the scariest topic of the decade was sex.He enlisted writer Desmond Child and various rock luminaries to help produce the Coop's ode to love and sex,TRASH.To my mind,this album is an honorable failure.The slick production brings to mind Bon Jovi and Poison.It's a battle of the sneering Alice verses the poppy production.It gave alice at hit with POISON and BED OF NAILS;and the barbed wit that is in most Cooper releases is still present.This pop view got darker with the next release,HEY STOOPID."
4,Definetly a Album for the Casual Alice Fan.,"Trash was the album that got me interested in Alice Cooper back in the late 80's. Tracks such as Poison , Bed of Nails and House of fire (one of my fave songs from Alice so far)where big hits back in the MTV rock era.As well as collaborations from Jon Bon Jovi and Steven Tyler any fanatic of late 80's music would get a kick out of Trash.You ask almost any casual Alice fan which song sticks in their mind and Poison would be their answer.My advice to anyone contemplating buying Trash......... Purchase Trash ,it is a fantastic rocker, but it is really not what Alice Cooper the solo artist is all about. Hey Stoopid and The last temptation showcase Alice at his best."
1,Dropped Once--No longer works,"My daughter purchased this cd player and really liked it because of the jog proof feature. However, she dropped it (just a few feet) and it now longer works at all! Lots of money for nothing!"
4,My son loves this helicopter - but not enough action in the figures.,My 4 year old absolutely loves the sounds and the fact that the blades move by pushing the button. The little guys that come with this are cute but are not poseable or adjustable. He has not had as much interest in the figures as in the helicopter itself.
1,even grannies need therapy,"Talk about self-indulgent. This sad old woman's reminiscences on how her daughter never forgave her for emotionally abandoning her as a tiny girl, and her 'realisation' that her daughter was not too bright, and had a flawed character, is not the sort of thing that you should ever write to your grand daughter as a parting gift...Not to mention her own misdemeanours-having a child outside her marriage and never being honest to anyone...I hated reading about how bright and special and sensitive she was as a child compared to her daughter and granddaughter. No wonder every one left her. I can't understand why anyone would want to hear her philosophy on life, take it to therapy granny."
1,Tanto rumore per nulla,Un libro tanto osannato quanto assettico. Da un libro cosi' pubblicizzato (da cui e' stato tratto anche un film) mi sarei aspettata certamente di piu'. Non vale la bena leggerlo tanto meno comprarlo.
1,Unrecommended,"I do not recommend this book. I purchased it under the assumption that it would include individual accounts of people dealing with MS. It does, but not in the manner that I presumed it would. The book does offer individual accounts of the struggle with MS, but the stories seem to be incomplete and unorganized. As someone living with MS, I wanted to know about the individual's diagnosis history, symptoms, treatment, etc. Many of the stories never mentioned specifics or they left out important events. The idea of what the individual's have been through does make the stories inspiring, but the lack of content and organization left me feeling frustrated and sad."
2,the smell is bad..product is okay,"I was looking for a less painful solution to waxing. I have pretty hard hair on my chest. It was kind of getting irritating with heavy hair because i have sensitive skin. I thought this would remove hair completely, but it only removed surface hair unlike waxing. I guess my assumption was wrong, but the smell is just unbearable. It's not possible to apply this thing outside, so i had to sit in the bathroom and deal with the smell. Even after, washing the body and removing this product, i was smelling bad. I still have one bottle left out of three and i am afraid of the smell. Overall, i think it would be a great product for people who don't have sensitive skin/hair, can deal with the smell and/or can't smell, have very small amount of baby hair."
3,About as good as I thought,It performed about as well as I had expected it to not the greatest thing ever but it does the job. My only complaint is that you have to pay a bit more attention while i was applying and removing than i would have liked to cause if you don't do it right its gonna leave a few burns. I used it to remove the hair on my chest and it left a little burned cause it took to long for me to get to my chest and i got some on my nipples which left them quite tender soooo that area should probably be avoided hurp derp
4,works,"works great, you cant try to conserve it to make it last though..make sure you have a lot on your skin when you do it and make sure the rag is damp..as far as 2 weeks goes, you will be getting rough...works great if everything is done right, i would recommend..make sure to do a test area first and NEVER leave on skin for more than 15 minutes"
3,"Works, with Conditions","Nair Hair Removal for men smells bad as it starts working, but it's not unbearable. And it's ""longer-lasting"" than shaving, which is what Nair advertises on the packaging. It worked for me, and is more comfortable than shaving in sensitive areas, but I still needed to trim a bit with a razor.Do watch your time when applying it. More than 15 minutes or so can dampen your enthusiasm quickly."
2,Not working that good.,"Doesn't really remove that much hair (40% of the hair I applied it to), despite putting on quite a lot and waiting the full 15 minutes. I do have what I would say is a lot of chest hair, and it can fairly long hair (over an inch sometimes).Also, the hair was noticeable again after 2 days.Not impressed or happy with my purchase, the only good thing, the smell wasn't too bad."
2,It works but it smells bad,"It does take away the hair really fast, but it smells awful, I kind of have to wiegh the good and the bad on this one."
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT buy this product, you will fully regret doing so. I kept it on for the amount it said to, and it caused bleeding. Do not buy this."
1,drawer pulls,"I returned these to you. They were not at all attractive looked like chicken's feet. Dingy, flat coloring as well.I tried to get Hickory's Acanthus Pull from you w/no success. Had to go elsewhere."
3,"Dated, But Still Good","This is one of those films that you saw a long time ago, and liked. When you happen to be in front of the TV at 3am and see that it's on, you just can't turn it off and go to bed.The main character is working in a lab that's designing cyborg systems for space exploration. His boss murders him, and uses his 'parts' in the prototype. When they realize that his consciousness was also awake in the cyborg, they try to destroy him. BIG MISTAKE.This film has some cheezy parts, but it's still pretty good. Pam Grier is a babe in this one! She's a trained assassin who likes to fight dirty. She's sent in to kill anyone the cyborg tries to make contact with, including the man's wife, if necessary.Decent flick with a fairly good plot. I recommend this one for the ""Remember When"" factor."
1,Too slow.,Spends too much time on the in between parts that characters go through. Is memorable though. Well filmed. Could have edited out like 1/2 hour and it would bother no one.
3,still persistent problem,"The authors address a still persistent problem in the US education system. How to motivate American students to learn another language. The papers look at this in the context of the high schools and universities.One incentive discussed is the enhanced career prospects to those proficient in several languages. While improvements to various teaching methods are suggested.It is sobering to realise that 32 years after this book appeared, the situation is scarcely improved."
3,ANTI-SEMITES RALLY AROUND PROF.NOVICK,"ALTHOUGH THIS BOOK IS EXTREMELY WELL WRITTEN, IT LACKS A HUMANISTIC ELEMENT WHICH IS RATHER SURPRISING GIVEN THE SUBJECT MATTER. NEVERTHELESS, PROF. NOVICK FEEDS THE BIGOTRY THAT IS RISING IN THE U.S. AGAINST JEWS. IF EVER THERE WAS AMMUNITION TO USE AGAINST ANY DEVASTATED GROUP OF PEOPLE, NOVICK CERTAINLY PROVIDES IT TO MANY WHO HAVE LONGED FOR THIS KIND OF OPINION. I CONSIDER THIS A VERY DANGEROUS BOOK BECAUSE IT WILL STIR UP THE FLAMES OF BIGOTRY BY MANY READERS AGAINST JEWS. I DON'T THINK THIS WAS THE INTENT OF PROF. NOVICK WHO IS QUITE AN INTELLECTUAL. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY HATE GROUPS WILL BE USING THIS MATERIAL FOR PROPAGANDA. WHAT A DISGRACE!"
3,I'm not really sure,"I actually came looking for the song ""In Your Eyes"". I haven't even heard of a lot of the other songs. The reason it gets a three is because I think ""In Your Eyes"" is a great love song. And I love the movie."
4,Rare find,I actually bought this CD just for Freiheit's Keeping The Dream Alive because there are no longer any Freiheit albums at shops! This song somehow evokes nostalgia. The rest of the songs are ok and typical of the late 1980s. Certainly a lot more palatable than the modern junk and trashy lyrics of Britney Spears or boy bands.
4,A Very Readable Introduction to the Life and Times of Martin Luther,Provides a very readable introduction to the life of Martin Luther. Covers Luther's entire life rather than only a portion of it. Especially valuable is the inclusion of the political climate and culture of medieval Europe in which Luther lived and developed his understanding of the Christian faith.
4,"Overall, a very good book","Well worth the read. This book provides a good summary of the person of Martin Luther and the events of his life. It reads rather quickly, too. I'm not a Lutheran, but one need not be to benefit from this book."
5,An excellent book,This book gives a very well balanced perspective on the life of an amazing man. It is easy to read and would suit the casual reader as well as those who consider themselves academic. I highly recommend it.
3,not bad,"product works fairly well , sometimes it has a hard time finding a signal outside but after a few minutes it finally does."
2,The thing stopped working in a year or so.,"I didn't use this unit very much, but when it worked well. Unfortunately, it stopped working in a little over a year.Sorry, that's not good enough to justify the purchase. Look elsewhere."
4,Almost perfect,"I bought the device a while ago but last weekend I had the chance to take it for a long ride. It was continuously plugged in my car's cigarette lighter, so I cannot tell anything about the battery life.The accuracy was really good and I have nothing else to complain other that during those two days it just turned off twice, relatively at short intervals one from the other. At the time it was connected to my PDA and it was showing my location. Just that suddenly the software told me that the connection with the receiver is lost and when I looked at it all the lights were off. I had to power it on, re-pair it with my PDA and everything was fine."
4,good product (recommended),i just instal it on my car today....the sound is kicking better than the original toyota manufacture that i have...but it have the bad part alsobad part:1.the mount is very hard to put in and it is not allowing you to put and take it out so easily2.doesn't look good in your car(but the sound is kicking)3.i dont like the graphic on this x plod its so fake......but still i recommend to buy this
2,No Leaves Left,I know Nick's music quite well and this work of art does not parallel Nick's work at all. Although Chris is clearly an accomplished piano player he does no justice to Nick's illustrious compositions. Most of these renditions sound rushed which scorn the original versions' interior and exterior beauty. Avoid this disc and check out other artists like Tim Story who perform this style of music much better.
2,does not work properly with Windows XP,"I had installation problem of I had to apply coorection for ISScript.msi from Microsoft site. after wards I got the software installed. but when I issue the print request, CP complains the print spooler is corrupted for MFC printer..."
1,Do not buy Brother's products,"Do not buy any products of this company.Their support is VERY VERY BAD! Their support department put me on hold for 30min then follow by a series of marketing questions.Another transfer to tech support took 30min and finally they can not do anything until I have to go home and sit in front of the machine and tell them what the display said.The bundle software, scansoft, is a piece of junk too."
1,Used only a few times and broke!!!,I purchased this printer and only used it only a few times before the rear paper feeder roller stopped working. It just makes this loud clicking sound like it's trying to engage but can't. I checked for any paper jams and their are none. So I think this printer must have a defective or broken gear or a problem along those lines. I emailed tech support and I am waiting for a response. This is frustrating.
3,Not British Tea !,"Warning - this tea is packaged in the US, and not the UK. Hence, it is weak and tasteless compared to the British equivalent. Very disappointing."
1,Does not fit 3rd Generation Zune,I bought this for my daughter's new 3rd Generation 4GB Zune. Nowhere in the item description does it state what generation Zune this fits. Since I am new to Zune I did not realize that it would not fit the Zune I was purchasing & now I have a clearscreen overlay that doesn't fit! It's not worth my time and trouble & money to bother returning it for the purchase price. I'm disappointed that Amazon didn't state this sizing problem at the time I made the purchase.
3,not good in my opinion,"I know this product wasn't expensive, but the frustration level of trying to get this little piece of plastic cut to size and aligned to my Zune face was very high. I decided it wasn't worth it and gave up."
1,good idea done wrong,"junk, it isnt any good, if you get fingerprints on the stky side you cant get it off a peice of dust gets in there an creates a bubble so u cant see"
5,"Amazing, worth every cent","I have seen the YYYs twice, unfortunately after they already broke through the mainstream. This DVD captured a lot of the old karen O style and presence. I love the video and the extra footage as well."
4,Nice Collection of Mostly Oldies...,"First of all, if you have kept up with the Walt Disney Treasures, especially vol. 1 of Silly Symphonies, then you don't need this one. Or, if you can still find the Silly Symphonies set, I recommend that instead. That being said, this is a moderately priced sampler of some really solid Silly Symphony classics that need more exposure. The Prince and the Pauper is not one of Mickey's best, but is interesting. This is a nice collection, albeit a little random. It is very worth having The 3 Little Pigs as well. Honestly, I bought it because my at the time unborn son seemed to like the song ""The World Owes Me a Living"" from The Grasshopper and the Ants, moving around and kicking whenever he heard it."
3,A Pauper,This film uses the classics of the Three Little Pigs and the Tortoise and the Hare to sell a very disappointing version of the Prince and the Pauper with Mickey Mouse. It is really one film with 4 trailers. It mixes the era of Silly Symphonies with the Prince and the Pauper from 1990 which makes for a poor compilation. The P&P is half of this 58 minute disc.The earlier works show an economy of storytelling that P&P lacks.
3,Lots of info - Hard to get it out,"While a comprehensive treatment of the subject, the book is confusing at times, which is disappointing for a 2nd edition. To be fair, one other individual in my class stated that this book ""was not more complicated than what he'd expect for other academic texts,"" but that's not a very good excuse to me. If you're buying a book for your own study, I would recommend Lea & Black's ""The New Testment: It's Background and Message"" as an equivalent."
2,Dry,"This was one of the texts for a recent seminary course and it's perhaps one of the most boring texts I've encountered in my academic studies. Not only do the authors fail to hold the reader's interest, the layout of the text on the page is hard on the eyes. Overall it's just a chore to read. There are so many better textbooks out there (and that's what this is in the worst sense of the word) I can't imagine why anyone would choose this one!"
5,Please Release the Rest of the Series,"Like most of the other reviewers, I have purchased all three seasons of the Real McCoys and look forward to buying the rest of the seasons of this series as soon as they are released. I was very young when this was on the air, but I do remember it well. Walter Brennan played a great role as Grandpa, and the rest of the cast were very good. Even more important, this is a TV show that you can watch with your family and not have to worry about inappropriate material."
3,Season 4-Not Coming,Once again another company/studio has failed to finish what they started. I emailed someone from Infinity and was told there would be no more seasons of the Real Mc Coys being released. Infinity now joins Universal and Paramount in not finishing what they started.
3,Different but still good,After listening to this CD it is amazing how different the music sounded when it was in the film. It works perfectly in the film but sounds so different almost like it's missing something when you are listening to it alone and not in the context of the film.
4,Haunting soundtrack.,"(As a first time buyer of Amazon MP3s) I was afraid of the quality. I don't settle for 128 versions. But this plays like a 320kbps mp3. Great quality on my Chopper2 Headphones.As for the music itself, I'm sure you already know that if you're here."
4,Sweeping and powerful,The movie was stunning and so was the soundtrack. They moved so well together that I was moved to tears. My husband felt that it was a bit repetitive but that's because they use the same melody in each song though each song varies dramatically. It's as if the melody is the story moving along and taking different shapes with every scene. I thoroughly enjoyed both.*Side note* It's great music to study to.
5,Very beautiful film music,"Fascinating, beautiful and moving music from the Kronos Quartet and rock band Mogwai.I played this CD all day yesterday, and I am listening to it now at 6:18 AM in the morning before work. How to describe it? A little like Ambient music, only played on acoustic instruments rather than synthesizers, not that I would have objected if it was all done electronically.Moody and spaceous music. The best soundtrack I've heard since Princess Mononoke."
5,One of the best soundtracks ever used in motion pictures,"I have not heard such a moving soundtrack ever before. Highly recommended! If you're hesitant(which I can't believe), check out the you tube and look for a clint mansell playlist. You'll fall in love with this album.I can't stress how great it is."
5,A Charlotte Mason Companion,"This is my favorite home education book! It is filled with encouragement, how-to information, lovely pictures, and wisdom. It is easy to read, not dry. This is a positive book geared to the heart of a child and their learning in all categories of their life that is of first importance. The pages are crisp white with easy to see script. This is absolutely the best book to help you get started enjoying teaching your family and even yourself. It will make you feel 8 years old all over again!This is definitely Charlotte Mason.I still use it regularly. It is the type of book you can begin at any section and before you know it you have finished the whole chapter, book, and didn't even need to read it in order of chapter sequence. Pick a topic & absorb. What you will learn in this book, you will always carry in your heart!If you can't afford a lot of extra how to books this is definitely the one to choose."
1,Finally made it work,"I bought this product on December 2006 and 'till now, it doesn't work.I urge all customers to NEVER buy this product from this brand, because, although it's expensive, it's useless. Don't waste your money.Found this cable on a box stored in home bring them back out, and contacted Cablestogo customer service live chat. The guy there was of so much help. I think the instructions were erroneous. The cable finally worked. when istalling the drivers, do not hook the cable, until the installation is finished, then it will work"
1,didn't work,"I tried to install the software a couple times, called the suport, and finally gave up. This product probably works for folks in IT departrments, but not for the rest of us."
3,Beware the fastener gender,"Be sure to check the fastener gender (not just the connector gender) on the jack that you intend to connect to. The jack that I was trying to plug this into had female fasteners as does this adapter - this will typically be true if you are trying to hook into a device and not just a cord. It would have been fine if the fasteners were removable on the adapter, but they are not."
2,The book gives an overview of writing for new media.,I am somewhat disappointed in what the book covers. It is fine for those who are completely new to the media. It informs readers about the terminology and general methods of communications of interactive media. Unfortunately it falls short for the more experienced writers. It is simply too basic and lacks detailed examples and instruction.
3,Maybe not as essential as originally planned...,"I read this book for a Writing for Multimedia class, and I can't say I was either elated or disgusted by it. Yes, I agree with other writers in that the language was quite simplistic, yet also quite repetetive. It definitely did a good job as an introduction to writing for multimedia, but I would not call it an essential resource."
4,Carter,"It is absolutely insane to deny the African American contribution to the Vietnam War. I think that Mr. Emanuel did an outstanding job recalling HIS experiences during Vietnam. As a former Military Service Member (Marine Captain) I can relate to some of his experiences outlined in his book. Even in this day and age some of the issues that he addressed continue to occur. Let's not turn a blind eye to the facts that he presents as an attempt to discredit one mans experience during the Vietnam War. Not many Soldiers, Sailors Airmen or Marines had an experience even remotely similar to his regardless of their color/ethnicity. I recommend this book for all Military buffs to read and believe it to be a well written account of his experience as an African American LRRP in Vietnam.Derrick CarterFormer Captain USMC"
1,Cat Groomong Comb,I have two Siberian cats - this comb could not even come close to going through their hair. Do NOT buy this product - a complete waste of my money!
4,"fun, fun, fun","This is not the best 3M camera on the market but for me it's the perfect little camera. The image quality is decent--not the best, definitely some noise issues particularly in low light situations. But, I shoot just for fun and my pictures aren't going on the web or being turned into framed art.This camera is easy to operate, has great features for beginners and even intermediate digital photographers. It's small enough that you definitely take it with you--it doesn't stay at home because it's too bulky or too heavy. In fact, it fits in the back pocket of my jeans, though I don't usually carry it there! It's also very unobtrusive--my friend calls it a spy camera. And the pictures are, like I said, not the best but decent--certainly good enough for newbies. If image quality is your biggest concern this is not the camera for you. A friend of mine has the minolta dimax (another small, square camera but no swivel lens) and i think the images are a little better, but I'm really happy it."
2,"Go with some other Nikon Coolpix camera, not this one.","Great size, OK images, awful durability.We've had to return the camera to Nikon for repair once and now it needs to go back. The door that secures the battery in place and hides the compact flash card is flimsy. It broke once and completely fell off this time.I love the Coolpix line and am on my 3rd Nikon Coolpix camera. I just wish this wasn't one of them..."
3,Day of The Wolves,"Good movie to see if you want to think back to when you were growing up in the late sixty's and early seventy's.It has that grainy cheap movie style. With flashes on the screen from the film used to cheap locations and even the never ending bullet supply that guns had.It was a good idea for it's day and I'm surprised it was never remade, at least I never heard of a modern remake.And one star as the bad guy was different to see in this film, that being the Master Mind criminal behind the plan Jan Murray."
1,Remastered and ruined,Man was I disappointed. Mind Bomb is a terrific album and I bought this to replace my aging cassette. Whoever remastered this should be fired; they compressed the crap out of it and all you can hear is the digital distortion. I A-B'd this with my tape and the difference is astounding. I'm not one of those analog is better than digital wonks. Digital is a good thing done right. This is done wrong. Give this a miss and go digging through the used bins.
5,Grammys Pot Pie in a Bag!,"My two dogs can't wait for their Grammys Pot Pie to arrive. They are pretty persnickity but the mixture of this food is a real treat that is sure to peak their interest. It is a good, wholesome product and I have no regrets feeding my two best friends such quality ingredients. Amazon makes the ordering easy, the shipping is prompt and we are all happy. Thanks. Do your pets a favor and try this brand by Merrick. Who wouldn't love Pot Pie made by Grammy ?"
3,Just so-so,"I bought the shields w/ the hope that I would be able to get more milk from them than w/ the hard ones that come w/ the pump. My lactation consultant told me this would probably be the case. However, I did not get more milk, just my normal amount. These shields are more comfortable than the hard ones, but you can only tell after you've used the soft ones for a while and then use the hard ones. The difference at first is not noticeable. However, they were not expensive so if comfort or needing to get more milk if driving you to get these, they are definately worth a try and hopefully you will have better luck than I did. Happy Nursing!"
1,Medela Shield Softfit,"I bought a set of pump shield softfit two month ago. I recently found grease matter on the shield surface after I cleaned and steamed the parts. It seems the grease was from the shield materials. The shield surface looks ""sweaty"". I don't know what caused it, but have stopped using the product. I wouldn't recommend this softfit."
2,rusting stainless,"Just dont make stainless of high grade any more. One hundred percent stainless steel and lifetime warrenty and will not rust they say. This is the 3rd on Ive had in 10 years. Its the only muffler they make for our Buick. But once again the internals rust away and blow out the tailpipe while the outside is still lookin good. I believe it will be the last, I will have one made next time....."
2,Not Exactly as Pictured,"I bought this rug thinking that the borders would be very dark and stand out against the rest of the rug. I also thought the rug would be a richer deep dark red color. The rug was almost an off orangish color and while you could definitely see the borders, they were not super dark and I didn't feel there was enough contrast. Sent it back."
4,A natural selection,"Twinings blend of Ceylon and Indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor. In non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness, brightness, strength and flavor. Normally I wouldn't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses, trucks, and stores for long periods of time. Yet Twinings seems to hold up well. I love tea, would drink 24/7 if possible, and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them."
3,"Good Product, Short Expiration Lifetime","Certainly a great British tea product. Traditionally, such products come to the customers with at least one to two years for shelf life freshness. This end-of-the-2009-year purchase (six big boxes!) provided me with the product expiring in June 2010. Somewhat short of my expectations; all the more so, expiration dates are clearly written on the boxes and, I am sure, processing staff could easily note this."
2,"crystal very pretty, but unfinished look.","the feng shui ball is very pretty, but the hole the drilled on the top is unfinished. It left it looking like i said unfinished."
1,Company very unprofessional,"I have no idea how this looks, or any information regarding its quality. I can only tell you that the company that ships this product is very unprofessional. I ordered this item over a month ago for my son and have yet to recieve it. I have made 3+ attempts to contact the seller to no avail. They have refused to even send me an email letting me know the product will be late or not even coming at all. I wish I had read the feedback on this seller before placing my order because I would have discovered that this is a problem they have had before. Save yourself the trouble, order a similar product from someone else!!!"
3,I don't know why but I must keep listening.,"This was the second album Jandek released in 1994. It features Jandek performing alone with his acoustic guitar (plus harmonica on one song). Jandek's guitar playing has improved over the years, but it's still completely unconventional. And his songs are as weird as ever. Jandek fans should enjoy it, but that is an infinitesimal percentage of the population."
5,Excellently Written and Pictorial Vietnam War Narrative,"An honest, ground-level, and poignant true story of an Army chaplain, Colonel Sam Hopkins, who served with one of the most highly decorated units of the Vietnam war---4th Battalion, 60th Artillery (Dusters). This plainspoken book is highly recommended because it contains none of the vulgarism, horrors, and often John Wayne bravado depicted in many war narratives. Armed with only a Bible and Kodak Instamatic camera, Hopkins takes the reader on a somber, yet at times humerous, journey into the Vietnam war and the lives of the young American soldiers who fought there; faithfully reminding them time and again, that their frail lives belonged to a higher authority---to ""Supreme Six,"" the Army's slang for God. His feelings, doubts, and fears, before, during, and after the war so clearly presented give this book an unequivocal place in Vietnam war literature."
2,Nothing new under the sun,"I have nothing new to add to the reviews mentioned above. To restate some, though: the printer eats through ink and requires to be cleaned five or more times prior to each print and still does not provide more than an adequate print; the loss of one color makes the entire machine inoperative for any function -- great for Brother ink sales, horrible for use."
3,Reliable....but can be better.....,"All functions are as expected....no surprises but the machine is reliable, I haven't had any glitches so far....Two things I think Brother can make it better value for customers:1) as with the OCR software provided, the HP all-in-one and Lexmark all-in-one can cater for Chinese OCR but my Brother cannot.2) the Lexmark model is cheaper yet has a faster fax modem of 33.6k"
5,More than I bargained for,"I love my 3100C. I bought it for a fax. Found myself using it constantly to make copies. I like the color copies. Well worth it. In fact, I am going to buy the 9700 multifunction machine so I can do a larger volumes of copies for my home business and for its priting abilities. I was an old die-hard Hewlett Packard fan until now. I had a LaserJet Series II which was one of the best things I ever bought, but 10 years later, after buying the HP1200 and being so disappointed, I am a Brother fan. Times change. I really like the fax reject button. Maybe all faxes have them, but it's great. When I get faxes, I know I'm getting them. Somehow I'm on some advertising fax lists, so when the call is from an unsolicited fax, I just reject it. Eventually you get taken off the list because I guess they don't get credit unless the fax goes through."
3,"Sweet, but...","The puppy is not as cute as the bear! We got the GLO E animals for Christmas this year, on sale. The kids do enjoy them. The bear is definitely the cutest. Too bad too because the puppy looks so adorable in the picture, but something about his giant head just makes him not so cute."
5,It's so CUTE!,"I purchased all 3 GLO E plushies and the puppy is my favorite. It's just so cute! The other were gifts, but this was for myself. Overall, the stuffed animal is really soft, but the area where they put the battery unit (for the glow light) and the Velcro area for the opening was a bit hard.I wasn't too fond of the glow lights as they don't really appear to me. The sad puppy face is why I wanted it."
2,Waste of money,"The source code implementation of the design patterns presented in this book differ radically bewteen vb6 and vb.net (as one might presume). Unfortunately, the vast majority of the supporting text is geared towards presenting an understanding of the vb6 code. It appears as though the vb.net(vb7...) material was added as an afterthought(in a rush), probably after the book had already been largely written. The vb7 material is brief, vague and frankly incorrect in some of the examples! Please don't make your future(?) customers pay for the fact that you got caught with a finished book on a technology platform(vb6), whose sunset was imminent."
3,The Only VB.NET Pattern Book (So Far),"As of April 2002, this was the only book to explain patterns using VB.NET code.It is poorly edited. In the first ten pages of Chapter 2, I found three editing errors that interfered with comprehension of the materials. As I browsed much of the rest of the book, I was annoyed by having to first wade through a VB6 example before getting to the VB7 (VB.NET) example. If I want to be conversant in the still quite new (and very hot) pattern approach to OO, why would I care very much about the old version of VB?My plan is to just study the original Gang of Four book and to put this one on the self as a reference in case I have difficulty with implementing in VB.NET."
2,Ninja turned SWAT team,"I've seen worse ninja movies before; but even they had more attention to martial arts than this flick does. There seems to be a preoccupation with watching military soldiers being mowed down by gun fire than anything ""ninja"" at all. Its more like watching a swat team in action. I'd give a lot more to see a ninja against another ninja which is why I'd stay clear of this flick and bet my money on ""Revenge of the Ninja"" or ""Enter the Ninja"" as they are some of the greats in this genre."
2,Diversion for one hour!,"I call this movie a ""Z"" movie. It should not be taken seriously. But the budget was apparently very tight and it is in view of that still intresting to see that a movie eventually was presented by Mats Helge. There are of course other action movies out there that are so much better but nevertheless perhaps you should give this Swedish production a chance if you want to spend an hour or so before the TV. Just for fun!"
5,Full of Wisdom from a seasoned performer,"Your Name Here charts Susan Merson's journey through her creation & performance of 6 different solo plays--and what she learned along the way. Full of wisdom, quotes, and tons of useful information (even for someone who's been performing for years!), I'd highly recommend this book to any actor/writer wanting to bring a story to the stage."
5,Perfect receipt for a busy office,"These receipts are compact, make copies without carbon, and meet the expectations of a busy office or school setting. I especially like the size and easy portability. I can go to a meeting at another location and simply put the receipts in my purse or brief case."
4,"Changing lives, one punch at a time.","Sifu Ralph Haenel's text is a great work book for students of all martial arts; from the novice to the master practitioner.The simplistic theory, and logical approach to self defense is revealed in this book in a clear and concise presentation. The strengths of this book include the many detailed photos of Wing Tsun self defense techniques while also providing secret knowledge on the philosophy of balanced living that Wing Tsun Kung Fu can provide to every individual."
1,"No stars, if I could","Folks,I cannot fathom what the other 29 ""reviewers"" saw in this book, and their positive reviews make me very suspicious. This book is 319 pages long, and exactly 47 pages deal with actually teaching this author's style, Wing Tsun. The rest of the book (no kidding) is spent talking about the author, and why he is enthused about Wing Tsun. This is not surprising since he has a website where he sells Wing Tsun materials and continues to advertise himself.So, if you want to spend your hard earned cash for a prolonged self-promotion, be my guest. But I am returning this book."
3,"By the end of the second disc, everything is very repetitive","The 2 disc set starts out well with remixes by Front Line Assmebly and varied DJ's, and is pretty solid through the first CD. After the :wumpscut: mix on the 2nd CD, though, everything breaks down into droning, synthesized beats which don't combine well with everyone's favorite ""Lock the target"" lyrix. Overall, though, i recomend the CD, just for the fact that it's the newest selection from Front 242."
4,Look carefull ...,"Atetion in Empirion cover, is the best of this record. Fast, clean, perfect for the DJs who wanna have Headhunter in your set again (like me :))"
2,Skip Martindale and go straight to Lewis,"This book suffers from two faults. First, it does very little beyond restating what Lewis wrote in his books. None of his books are very long, so I suggest you skip this one and just get it from the horse's mouth. Second, Martinadle falls into the same old trap of casting Lewis in his own image. Lewis was an enigmatic square peg, but so many readers twist Lewis' words to endorse their own ideas because they've fallen in love with the picture of C. S. Lewis that live in their minds. This effect helps book sales, but it leaves Lewis misunderstood."
5,"Oh yes, it's good!","I happened to catch this movie on TV and fortunately for me, taped it. I loved the scenes between Judith Ivey & Don Johnson - in the store & by the river - best love scene I have EVER seen. The scenes between Jason Robbards & Don Johnson makes you feel like you are listening at the door on the veranda. The music is wonderful, different, haunting and adds so much - the direction and shots and the passion - they're all there. I watch this movie once a summer - when it is very hot out. Wish I could see it on the BIG screen."
3,What are they supose to be anyway?,"you know i've got neices and nephews who are like little kids. Ive seen Backyardignas afew times. i like the music and the dancing and animation are pretty cool, but what are they supose to be anyway? i mean I know one's a hippo and ones moose and one's a bird but what the smell is that pink thing? I've never seen a animal what looks like that before. man its wierd. OKay so like you can tell the pink things supose to be a black person and that dingo or whatever's supose to be a white guy and ther's this one named Pablo whos likee suppose to be a mexican or something, but what about Chinese people i mean come on. Really. What about chinese people?? Its like this one time when I was in this chinese restraunt you know but only Mexican people worked there, so i said ""Yo! Where's all the Chinese dudes?"" and everybody laughed and people said i was stupid. turns out el chico is really a spanish name--no fooling!Anyway Backyardigans is realy cool and you shuld check it out"
4,Great Halloween costume accessory,I picked this up for a '20's gangster Halloween costume and its about perfect! The gun itself is 3/4 scale versus a real tommy gun but that's not a problem... it might also make you look less threatening if taking it with you to a costume party or out to a bar!
1,FRAGILE! Made of imatation eggshell!,"Total garbage. Would be a rip-off even at the dollar store. Dropped on wood floor from child height, maybe 3 feet max- broken stock and cracks in black plastic gun body. We bought two of these for Halloween, now in trash. Had to use black tape to make them last the night. Boo!"
2,Dollar store style toy gun not worth $15.99,"At US$15.99 I expected better - something.It's a little bigger than the Dollar Store machine guns I buy for US$1.00, but it weighs practically nothing - like the dollar store guns. It's glued together, so you can't repair it. The front grip doesn't fold down. Ho hum."
5,deceptively small,"Small, yet VERY good GPS unit. Able to discern a signal where another (lower quality product) was not. I haven't tested it to the point where I've run out of batteries, but for sure my laptop runs out before the GPS does [several times]. This thing is TINY (3x5cm or 1.25""x2""), smaller than my pager. I have gotten this to work with my laptop GPS with MS Streets and trips via bluetooth (start GPS first, THEN connect the bluetooth connection) as well as my Cingular/HTC 3125 phone. very cool."
4,Great book for developers using OO,This book explains complicated details of Object-Oriented Analysis/Design and Object-Oriented Programming in ways that are comprehendible without losing meaning. The book contains a good differentiation between Aggregation and Composition. Author does a good job of using sample code and UML diagrams to explain his points. That said I felt there were things in the book that should not have been there since it is mainly geared toward novices. He sort of explains the reasons why a square should not inherit from a rectangle and then goes ahead and shows a UML diagram of a square inheriting from a rectangle. Things like this could confuse novices who are just learning these principles. A better discussion of the Liskov Substitution principle would have illustrated the point of why a square should probably not inherit from a rectangle. The book also contained some annoying typos.
5,Excellent hide and seek book,"This is an excellent find the XYZ (insert item there) book. Gigi the Giraffe and Zachary the Zebra lead us through several countries. Each page has suggested items to find, but there are many many more on each page you would make up on your own to find and look at, or use to play grouping games. The items listed are much more advanced than a lot of the books of this genre, enabling you to expose your child to a much broader vocabulary, while still presenting it in an engaging and age-appropriate manner for the toddler/preschool crowd. This book would still be interesting for younger children as well (6 or 7 probably) in terms of the pictures and broader vocabulary presented. This book has held my son's attention from about age 3 or slightly younger now to age 4 and still is going strong. He finds new things to see and new games to play with us looking at it, and even our infant enjoys just looking at the colorful pictures."
5,Working as a Therapy Dog,"Book is to the point.Each chapter is within the title. It's neat hearing from the dogs point of view. My favorite chapter was 16.What a wounderful way to give to others the wounderful pleasing touch of a loving breathing dog/dogs that really only want to please their owners,and by doing so they give joy and warmth to so many who often don't relate to a human. Thanks You Owners and Puppies."
2,perhaps it is my fault,"i got stuck once at a conference because I forgot my cones for my pump, so i set out to create an ""emergency"" stock of cones for the pump and car. I bought these connectors. I know there is a picture...maybe i didn't see it...maybe it wasn't there...maybe i am not that famililar with pump products...but I was SOOOO disappointed to find that these did not come with the yellow half circle things that make these connectors work with the shields. ugg.... then, i was at babies r us and those yellow things cost as much as a fully assembled cone, so i just bought the fully assembled cones... i am disappionted this didn't come more complete for the price...."
4,Great resource yet needs updating,"I was fortunate enough to run across a copy of Michael Wilcox's book years ago, when art supply manufacturers were in the process of eliminating fugitive pigments and replacing them with more permanent ones. Often a color is a blend of two or more pigments, so things get complicated, yet Michael Wilcox doesn't go into that rat's nest, but sticks to permanency data on the single pigments that we find in artisits' colors.Unfortunately, by now the book is somewhat outdated. That is, as one other reviewer has indicated, there are newer pigments out that just aren't listed in the book. As an artist who would like his paintings to last, at least a reasonable length of time, careful color selection is important. I would like to see Michael Wilcox turn out a new edition of this volume."
5,Good green tea,I used to buy this product in the grocery store and it suddenly was not available. It is a good basic green tea. It is of a stronger taste if brewed too strongly. The leaves unfold few times form the gunpowder form when brewed. Fun to watch. If you use too much it will be too strong. It is easy to brew for people not very familiar with green tea. Just a good start for the beginning of exploration. Other reviewers are much more knowledgeable about green teas so I would recommend reading other reviews.
5,Pleasantly Suprised!,"This film really is a treat. I found the writing to be smart yet quirky and the production value was essentially flawless. The movie really made light of the struggles and challenges of dating (especially in New York City). Well-placed cameos by Artie Lang and Susie Essman were a huge bonus as well. Overall, a great experience to watch and I'd highly recommend it to any couple or frustrated single person out there."
5,One His Best!!!!,"This book was great! It was the Third and final bood in TheNightMare Room Thrillogy. When April has to go back to the island she wants to find out what happned to her friend and solve the mystery, but the evil witch is wating for her on the island because the witch thinks that April is her daughter who put her on the island. What will happen? Read it and find out. If you liked all the other NightmareRoom books you will love this one!!!"
1,Wierd,I like the Beasty Boys but this is just to wierd for me. check out the new Taylor Hicks cd for good musik
2,Coming Soon to an Elevator Near You,"Not having an advance notion of what to expect, this non-vocal work was quite the surprise. In and of itself there are some catchy melodies - but it's sort of false advertising. When one buys a Beastie Boys CD - there is an expectation level to hear a certain type of music that's the band's trademark. This CD did not deliver. Had I heard some cuts w/o knowing in advance who was playing - The Beasties would not have ever come to mind."
1,Pure Garbage,"How can some artists always stay fresh with new sounds and others become washed-up? The only reason I give one star is because you can't give zero. This album makes for an expensive drink coaster.No fresh sounds, nothing upbeat and very monotone. I guess when you have a reputation like Beastie Boys you can assume something good is going to be relesed. After 2 clunkers in a row that's no longer the case.The name of the album should be called ""Fill My Bank Account"" since all they are doing is taking your money and retiring on it. These boys are a very long way from ""Paul's Boutique"" and ""Check Your Head""...two masterpieces.Zero stars!!!!!!!!!!"
1,FAKE! DO NOT BUY!,"I have been using My Couture for 2 years now and I know the original scent. When I saw this price, it seemed too good to be true. But I bought it anyway. BAD MOVE! This is a total fake. Does not smell like the real thing. DO NOT BUY!"
2,"If you love the Raiders ""do the right thing-buy Sundazed""","I originally purchased the set upon it's original release in 1990, over the years I have listened to it may times, continuing to comparing it to many other remastered tracks and cds of its time...always concluding that the tracks (especially disc 1, disc 2 kicks in with ""him or me"") sounded like they came directly from vinyl,I have today just received the Sundazed Midnight Ride. Let me tell you if you love this stuff as I do, and want to hear the Raiders, pass on this collection, and get the Sundazed, the sound blows ""Legend"" out the door! I can't wait to get the rest on Sun."
2,"OK with PC, does not work with KVM","We bought one of these at my workplace to connect a USB only pc to my Linksys KVM. The mouse did not work, the online LED on the KVM flashed constantly, occasionally the KVM would beep and switch to another port without my having done anything. Per cables to go tech support, I tried connecting directly to the PC without the KVM and it appeared to work fine in that configuration. The tech told me that cables to go usb - ps/2 adapter model 32185 uses a different chipset that ""seems to be more compatible."" I am already using the Trendnet TU-PS2 usb - ps/2 adapter with another PC on the same KVM and it works just fine. Buy the Trendnet adapter instead."
4,Good,"Good product that actually works. I can feel results right after taking it. You have to get used to the taste. When I added to much for the first time to the glass of water, i felt little sick."
4,A Fun Romp!,"When she finds her mother dead, 13-yr-old Rowan sets off to find her father, Robin Hood. Helped by her mother's elfin magic, a playful wolf-dog and a giant boy who makes magical music, she finds her father. More adventures await, as Robin is captured and Rowan's motley group joins Robin's band to rescue him.Don't expect a deep or adult-level tale. This is a short, fun book for girls in grades 3-8, especially those who like outdoor, rough-and-tumble adventure stories.This is the first book of the series."
1,poor Robin Hood,"This was awful. It read like a self-insert fanfic... right down to Rowan making her own band of ""merry men"" that included a horrifically childish minstrel (he seriously called someone ""meanie!"") and a princess on the run from an arraigned marriage (and nowhere do they indicate what this girl is a princess OF... there was a limited amount of royalty in England, and this girl was someone completely made up).Painfully anachronistic, a super-modern girl in Medieval England, and too simplistic for even young kids."
1,Save your money,"""Realm of the Sword: The Beginning"" is just another cheap rip off trying to capitalize on the ""Lord of the rings"" trilogy. Save your money as this book is a date with the clearance rack in less then a year."
3,Just okay.,"Realm of the sword is an okay book, with a few more editing errors than one would like. Some of the reviews below seem like chat between reviewers more than reviews. My review only suggests that if you like knights adn medieval times you might like this book, if you don't like this type of fiction then you will not like it."
1,Worst Book ever!,DO NOT WASTE A SINGLE PENNY ON THIS BOOK. Not just because the book is poorly written or is more boring then homework but because as probably the only person stupid enough to actually purchase and read this book I am offended by the author posting good reviews for himself as a kid. It is easy to see the last 2 good reviews were not only written by the same person but by the author himself.
2,Bias! Writer is out to try to ruin Kobe!,"This book is one of the most unbelievably biased things I've ever read. The writer seemed jealous of Kobe and his lifestyle, and therefore made him out to be this total creep (and a rapist, obviously.) While public opinion seems to be on the side of ""Not guilty"", this book goes as far as to give a detailed account of the rape scene, explaining how Kobe made her bend over (a chair), things he said to her, things that I thought were totally fabricated. Also, the girl is made out to be this sweet, innocent, poor thing just trying to make her way in the world.This is a book designed to organize lynch mobs, and revive the old KKK. Seriously guys? I thought we were past that."
5,works great,"If you are swimming more than a few laps, then keeping up with lengths/laps becomes a problem. A 50 meter pool takes 66 lengths to swim a mile. This fits snugly on your index finger and tracks laps, average times, and total time of the swim. You hardly notice it is on when you are swimming."
4,Nice,"NIce, but don't drop it, it isn't very sturdy. I tried to change the battery, ran down after a few months, but the torque on screwing the backplate on affected the LCD connections, then it leaked, so I had to buy another.That being said, it works well enough to be worth using it as a disposable item. Still, hope they improve the design."
1,Doesn't do anything except count,"Just got this, turned it on and all I can do is get it to increment the count when you push the button. No timing, no summary, nothing else except reset to 0! It came with no instructions but I found some online, but that didn't help. Amazon's getting it back!"
2,Little short,Product performs as stated but there is a little short in mine that causes my finger to tingle just like your tounge does when put on a 9volt battery just not quite as strong. Invigorating or disturbing I'm undecided
4,good for lap swimming,"A nice, small compact lap counter. can be confusing with only one button running all of the functions, but for simple counting, it works well"
1,Functioned only as a counter,"I too received a 90040 counter dressed up like a 90010 counter/timer. The invoice and all the packaging referred to it as the counter/timer but the device only operated as a counter. Given the rash of other recent reviewers who experienced the same thing I would highly recommend not buying this device from this seller. They clearly have a not-insignificant number of defective or misconfigured SportCount devices and despite the multiple returns they have not taken steps to address their stock problem. At best, the seller is negligent; at worst, they're knowingly trying defraud their customers."
3,Basic lcd flat panel monitor,"This is a basic introductory, no real frills flat panel monitor. I use one of these at my workplace quite regularly, and it gets the job done. for gamers and other folks, the resolution is not as high as others. Also, the adjustments of the base only allow for tilt forwards and back, not up and down for height, so the ergonomics are not as good as other HP monitors. Howerver, the price is usually pretty low now a days on this monitor, so if you are looking to free up more desktop space, look into getting this monitor.minor specsbrightness 300 nitscontrast ratio of 450:117-inch viewable screen1,280 x 1,024 native resolutionPlug and Play"
4,Works well!,"We bought this monitor used and have had it for a month now. So far, it seems to be working very well!"
1,"Product was not the same as HP L1702 17"" LCD Monitor",Product sent was not the same quality as advertised. Poor packing resulted in damaged equipment. Monitor was put in box without adequate insulation. Return was requested
2,Almost completely useless for Games!!!,"This book is all but usefull. It basically gives you the math to implement OpenGL/Direct3D in software, but gives near to no details on using theses libaries to make cool games. The only part that was applicable to a game today imo was the shadow and lighting section. The shadow was so short on details that it was useless in the first place and the lighting part is the reason why this book gets 2 stars instead of 1. If you want to learn the internals of a 3D engine, I would even go as far as to suggest Andre Lamoth's book . If you want to know how to use math for a game in today's world and not back in 1990, then forget about this book. Plus, it's cluttered with proofs. A lot of pages are wasted proving that something is true."
4,Love it!,"This book was great. Their was hardship, Optimism, following one's dreams and love. The combination was fabulous! it made for a great read!!!!"
1,Stay away with this seller,"I had purchase with this seller. Product is not they look on screen. You can't cancle, return this product because this one is not selling by Amazon. There are no any cust service."
1,Read if you use a portable digital audio player!,"I have the 1GB Microdrive (you can get it way cheaper from Iomega.com) and I thought it was cool at first but now I know just how bad it really is. I don't use it in my digital camera cause I never take that many pics at a time. I tried to use it in my LYRA 2 player. It works fine if your not moving. Because it has moving parts it skips a lot and creates a ton more heat than a real compacflash card. DO NOT USE IN A PORTABLE DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYER! It skips every time you move. If your're going to put up with skips you might as well use CD-R's for 50 cents each with an MP3 cd player.If you want more space get one of those Archos jukebox recorder things with 20 gigs that work as hard drives too. You don't have to convert MP3's into anything (like mpx on most ""mp3"" players) and you'll have as much space as most laptops do."
5,This book is great for women.. as a Review & Reminder...,"This is a great book. I have given a gift copy to all the women I care about. It serves many purposes & can help every woman, no matter which background they have started from. Very good for uplifting personal psychology & understanding yourself better. It is a confidence/self-esteem builder; helps you figure out how to deal with the ""monsters"" in your personality; serves as a reminder of important values you may have forgotten & reminds you to respect yourself & find strength in your weaknesses. And among many other things, has fun illustrations & kind humor. 10+ (A kind & personal psychology workbook)...Thanks Karen! (& Walt)"
4,Very Entertaining ... Great Insight into the World of Espionage,"This was a very entertaining read. Despite the story of Aldrich Ames being a little mundane, the author found a way to keep the book consistently interesting.Ames was merely a CIA lifer who decided to sell documents to the Soviets in hopes of getting rich. Many CIA agents stationed within the Soviet Union would be captured and killed during the cold war as a result of his information. Yet despite all this, the CIA never seemed to catch on; they even promoted him. While Ames and his tale of espionage is rather banal, the story of how one man can single handily do so much damage as a result of greed and lust is absolutely fascinating.If your interested in the story of Rick Ames, this is the book you're looking for. If your more interested in the history of the CIA, I would suggest:Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA"
4,"Not what I expected, but pretty good","This wasn't exactly what I expected: There's no discussion of VersionCue, versioning and naming in general, or color managment.But that said, it's a pretty good book - I'd recommend it for anyone who hasn't yet thought about what they do as a ""workflow"".It offers great tips on most of the common tasks that you'll encounter with Photoshop - as well as talking about working extensively with Layers, which is essential to any intelligent workflow.I just wish it had addressed the more complex topics I list above. But I'm still glad I bought this book."
2,Dissapointed!,"We just got this for our 7 month old. She loves pretty much anything Elmo and was laughing so much in the store whenever we activated the demo. We were sure that this was going to be her new favorite toy. After we got it home and together for her, she got bored very quickly with it and now will not give it the time of day. The box claims that this toy says over 40 phrases, but I feel as if it is more like 20. We already put it back in the box and have it ready to be returned for a refund."
3,Good at first....but poor quality product,"This is good because it does catch baby's attention with bright colors and music. The infant setting, gives you a long music setting. The music is a bit loud, I put cotton taped over the holes.Not so good..when the batteries get low, you need to change them right away, it makes this horrible, scary sound, rather than cheerful music.I have had my gym for about 4 months now, and when I press the buttons on the toddler setting, nothing happens. Music is sapposed to play when you touch/pull the buttons and hanging toys.The batteries aren't low, but elmo is moving back and forth very slow, with no music, so basiclly I can't use it, after 4 months.But the 4 months it was used, it was nice. I would reccomend something else."
1,I Believe It's A Thing Called Crap!!!!!,"Lousy songs, terrible singer and a style that died out with spandex and grown men with make-up.There is no originality here at all, but if you're going to imitate anything, let it be anything other than 80's metal!!!Is there something wrong with the singer?? He sings like his pants might be on too tight.I recommend this music for no one. Once the initial fascination fades with this band, you'll walk into a used record store and find this c.d. all over the place, just like the old 80's metal albums that I gave away so long ago."
2,Disappointed,"After reading this book to my young daughter for the first time, I was very disappointed. The story of Frederick is the opposite of Aesop's fable about the Ant and the Grasshopper. Aesop showed the importance of doing one's job and what is required from them in order to live. Frederick showed that one can do their own thing, regardless weather or not others are dependant on them. I suppose this book is repesentative of modern day; an age in which it seems an increasing number of individuals are refusing to take responsibility for their actions. It celebrates life, but shows that doing your chores is unimportant."
5,a beautiful story,"For twenty years I remembered this beautiful story and told it to friends. As my little girl began to read I ached for this book, to encourage both her love of words and love of play. All I could remember was that there was a ""leo"" in it, and I thought Leo was the ""lazy"" mouse.I recently found another book by Lionni in a used bookstore, and immediately recognized it's author by the illustrations. There was, after all, a ""leo"" involved. Perhaps I wasn't so far off in confusing the ""lazy"", imaginative mouse with the book's author! :)I am so glad this book is still in print and I highly recommend it."
4,Shorter than I expected...,"I forgot to look at how long the cord was but when I pulled it out of the package I was taken aback. Mind you I did not get out a ruler to measure but I'm pretty sure it was only 6"" instead of a foot long. It was pretty dang short compared to the 3 foot ones that went missing but it did its job with a 3 prong extension cord."
5,Does the job,"Bought this for a 47"" HP Flat HD LCT TV. Needed a longer cord then what came with it. Works as good as the one that came with the TV."
1,total garbage power cord. 18 awg 12 feet IEC,"Do not buy these chinaes power cords unless you want your house to burn to the ground. I ran one of these for an expensive power strips power cord. I plugged 2 xboxes and 2 monitors into the strip. About an hour later I stepped on the cord and could not believe how hot it was. I picked it up in my hand it was extremely hot and flexible, quite scary. I thought I could smell something that was very warm but wasnt sure until I felt it on my foot. These cords are 12 feet long and 18 gauge. Get some 14 gauge if you need power cords. These are a fire hazard and should be avoided at all costs. Also if the cord gets that hot then chance are you are not getting the voltage you should be getting. Low voltage can damage or ruin some electric devices."
5,Excellent quality for a great price,The cable was exactly as described and was packaged in a manner assuring that no damage would be incurred whilst in transit.
4,Very handy for reducing cable clutter,"IEC cables are ubiquitous these days - they are used on all kinds of computer and consumer electronics equipment. If you use the supplied cables, which are usually six foot long, for all your wiring, it will lead to a nightmare of cable clutter.The solution: buy short IEC/AC cables of various lengths, and use a cable just as long as you need... 1 foot, 2 foot, 3 foot. The only way they could improve is by having them in length increments of every half foot up to about four feet.These are quality cables and are great for reducing cable clutter."
4,Great Product,"Very satisfied with this product, would recommend it to all my friends and family. It arrived very quickly and was exactly what I needed at a reasonable price too!"
5,It's magic!,"This album is wonderful! Prior to hearing it I read some bad reviews about it and was resisting from buying it. I bought, hear it and I have to say that now it stands as one of my favorite cds. The music is so uplifting, I bet it can change the mood in everyone. What I really love about UB40 works is how inventive they are in all the rhythm and special sounds. They are captivating and very elaborated. Sure they still have their special touch. 100% recommended."
4,more groove from DTTB,"Excellent British instrumental band. I saw them live at the Jazz Cafe in London a year ago and they were amazing. Fat grooves, jazz/funk/acid jazz sort of style, piano and sax led. Guaranteed to keep your head moving. As their previous releases, a must for any acid jazz's collection. I wonder why these guys aren't more famous here in the US. Highly recommendable."
1,Non reliable one side story,"The typical leftist view which does not recognize that in 1973 Chile was the laboratory for the cold war. More than 12.000 cuban soldiers were introduced into Chile by marxist Allende. He was not able to govern the country but divided its population into two sides and led them into a civil war, which was stopped at the las minute by the armed forces, requested by a majority of the population, includin Christian democrats, now allied to the socialists in the government."
5,Recording Info 1941-1950,"Liner notes didn't provide recording dates, so here it is: 1. Leap Frog (5-10-45) 2. Sentimental Journey (11-20-44) 3. You Wont Be Satisfied Until You Break My Heart (11-23-45) 4. Floatin' (3-27-46) 5. I've Got the Sun In The Morning (3-27-46) 6. A Foggy Day (4-24-50) 7. Bizet Has His Day (9-17-41) 8.

3,A Pearl of Death,"Fairly good video version of one of the most famous Sherlock Holmes stories, with a particularly nice ending showing Holmes and Lestrade in a rare moment of rapport. The story, which features a very dramatic device that keeps the plot moving with some urgency, was imaginatively adapted into one of the best Holmes movies starring Basil Rathbone, ""The Pearl of Death."""
4,Dick Dale was the Pioneer...,"I knew of Dick Dale's more well known tunes, his first ""Let's go tripping"" & ""Misirlou"", but the lesser known tracks are quite good. It demonstrates Dale's growth from his first to the ""Pipeline"" remake. The tracks are pretty much layed out on chronological order, and that's good.His style is all over this cd, no mistaking it. He's described as ""High Energy"", and I'm not a fan of harsh surf - some of that here, but all good.I recommend this cd for surf tune lovers and how surf all started with Dick Dale."
5,The most underrated CD out there!,"Dick Dale is a legend. Dale's influence on the surf community was amazing. He influenced the likes of the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix. He IS the origin of surf music. The music on this CD is intense, electric, and hypnotic. It's worth the bank!"
2,DickDale-King of the Surf Guitar,Don't think Dale can play a song the same way twice. Didn't like the selection of songs nor the way they produced.J
5,DVD episodes contain more minutes of viewing than T.V. reruns...,"We were pleasantly surprised to find the viewing time is (approx.) 5 minutes (?) longer than the more recent T.V. re-runs.As I posted on Season 2...at least 4 (maybe more) of these main actors were somehow personally involved in the sorrows of Nazi Germany. Some narrowly escaped with their lives, and several members of their families were not so fortunate. Le Beau (Robert Clary) himself, a Polish Jew, spent 30 months as a prisoner of war. I recommend Hogan's Heroes for family viewing, and encourage the further study of the lives of those affected by that very real war and holocaust."
5,short on special features long on laughs,"The third season of Hogan's heroes is short on special features, a few photo galleries and a clip from the Pat Sajak show, but the shows themselves are some of the best including Hogan Go Home and War takes a holiday two of my favories episodes.You will see a lot more of the Gestapo and a particular Major and a little less of a certain plump General. You will also spot William Christopher in his 4th and final spot on the series playing ""Thomas"" subbing for Carter as well.My teenage sons are enjoying this series as much as I have. I am waiting for the simpson's clip to show up (I'm guessing season 5).Buy it and enjoy"
5,fantastic,Got this for my husband and he was thrilled great quality and inexpensive.I got him the whole series as a suprise for Christmas shhhhh
4,Third Season still good,"Lot of laughs after a hard day. Some clever plots, vaguely related to actual WWII events. But you don't watch Hogan's for the realism. Probably the last season we will buy - the series ""jumps the shark"" shortly after this."
5,Prisoners!,Hey I like it and that's all your going to get unless you have to put in more words which is rediculous!
4,Stellar Dreams,"Over 50 years of vocal music is covered in this wonderful CD. Not since Judy garland has there been such a heart-wrenching renhition of ""Over the Rainbow"" - but the vocal quality is of a caliber never achieved by Garland. From ""I'll Be Seeing You"" to ""Waters of March"", her interpretations are warm and exciting. I rate it four stars rather than five only because I missed the lyrics in the CD jacket (which were included in her first CD 'Never-Never Land"", a 5 star if there ever was one). Try it you'll like it - and become addicted to Jane."
3,Look elsewhere....,If Jane Manheit is an extraordinary singer or interpreter of music you will not hear it on this recording. This recording offers the listener pleasant and occasionally antiseptic background music. Look elsewhere if you want to be moved.
3,Just okay...,"I really only wanted the single, ""So Many Stars,"" but it was only available on this album. In my opinion, that song is the singer's best."
2,Carefully inspect them!!!,"I bought a pair of black ones and was very pleased. They sounded great and could handle a lot of power.I decided to buy a pair of white ones and pair them with the black ones to complete the rear and suround portion of my home theater. Well the white ones wern't anywhere near the sound quality of the black ones!!! Same speaker, different color, WHAT????? Well after trying a couple of things I noticed the white ones had thin cracks all over them and they would rattle if you turned them up. Also one of them was louder than the other.Well, I got burned on this one. By the time I went to use them and figured out some one had dropped them several times and over powered one of them, then returned them to Amazon, it was past the return limit and Amazon would not take them back. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY RE-SOLD THEM TO ME IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! I always trusted Amazon. BUYER BEWARE"
4,Bill Stout - fascinating autobiography,"Stout was the guy who designed the Ford Tri-Motor for Henry Ford. But as this book shows, he did lots of other things too. Written in 1951 so it's closer to the times it covers.A great book."
2,Only the two bonus tracks show potential...,"It's emabarrassing when he talks about his current celebrity life, but when he raps about growing up in Fresno and gets more emotionally revealing, it shows potential. I only heard the snippets here on amazon, but I did kind of like the last two bonus track samples..."
1,Who told him he could rap?,"This is just as much of a joke as the Paris Hilton CD. Simply put: he can't rap, his lyrics don't even have comedy value, and he recycles beats. What Eminem did for white rappers, Federline detracts from just as much."
1,Musical spam.,"This music is spam on the world of musical email. It is a pop-up that you close as soon as you're aware of it.As there is no justification for the atrocities in Darfur, there is no justification for this."
1,"This album came from a ""Popozao""","The fact that this talentless, trailer trash, nobody even has a record deal is a horrible insult to all aspiring musicians everywhere. There are so many talented people out there yet morons like him seem to make it. It's almost like having no talent is required to get a record deal these days. Hip hop has already had it's fair share of bad music but this is just a new low. If this idiot wasn't Britney's husband, he would be just another nobody working at Burger King. Thank God Britney came to her senses and dumped this greasy loser. I'm not a fan of her either but at least without her Gay-Fed will be out of the spotlight. This is defintely the worst album of the year. Bow Wow has more skills than this clown and after hearing this trash, I actually gained some respect for Vanilla Ice. Yes this album is that bad."
1,THIS IS AWESOME!,"Haha, just kidding. Listened to it online, hated it like I thought I would. But I have to say I play ""Popozao"" with my friends when we feel like being complete douchebags!I'm just happy Britney divorced him. I mean, how many divorces really warrant an explosion of confetti and applause on ""The View""????FedEx, take your pennies from Brit and slink back into a little hole with Shar Jackson and maybe people will stop hating you."
1,playing with fire,His horribly fat wife couldn't help this loser.How could anyone even give him money to produce this garbage.This boy is just a drugged up wanna be money maker.But in reality he is isn't even that good.Brittany is also done so thank god those two losers are outta here.Rolling stone will rank the worst music ever and I believe that he will rank up thier with Sean and Yoko.
1,The end of civilization as we know it.,"Anyone, and I mean anyone who buys this piece of garbage should be forced on a boat and sent from this country in shame. Seriously......buying this thing should be grounds for immediate removal from the US. Oh yeah, you should have the words ""Really big loser"" tattooed on your forehead so that all can see your idiocy and avoid you like Typhoid Mary.What sucks even more, is you can't rate this piece of dung with zero stars. So don't think the 1 star is a shining beacon of hope, or anything."
5,Awesomness Abroad!!!!!,"This CD is so awesome!!!! Everytime I run out of Prozac or Zoloft, I pop in this little ditty that reminds that my life could've been much much worse!!!It's so good that I lost 2 inches off of my waist laughing at this soo hard!!! K-Fed is the ultimate hardcore gansta rapper. Jay-Z, Eminem, Fat Joe, Diddy,...Diddy ...oh wait scratch Diddy-, but to the rest of the guys, move over cuz K-Fed is gonna stomp on your ground and steal you Popozao."
1,"LMFAO, You Serious?","It just comes to show that Hollywood stars are washed-up no talent hacks nowadays. Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, Sean Combs, Kid Rock, and now Kevin Federline are just some of the prime examples. Unlike all of the others, Mr. Federline fails to realize that it is not 2000 anymore! White trash rap and pop have been comatose for quite some time, and this release isn't helping to bring it back. (Which I'm glad that it's not BTW.) We seriously didn't need another Vanilla Ice.Tell you what, buy this CD if you want, but don't come crying to me telling me that ""I didn't warn you"" B.S., because I definitely warned you and made it clear. Expect it to plague the secondhand bins within the next few months."
3,It's okay,I liked the version of lose control on Yahoo! music but the preview on Amazon sounded different - what happened to the old one? I liked that one better.I think he has potential but if he really wants to make it in the rap world (or the music industry at all) then he has a lot of homework to do.So it's okay - but maybe a bit less of the skits and a bit more rapping in future? And what happened to the hidden track which has now been replaced with two bonus tracks?
1,Disaster,The very existence of this cd is a true testiment to the current state of the music industry.
2,A brand-new appreciation for silence,"Federspiel has not one but TWO bonus tracks here, but the real bonus is when the cd ends and silence returns. Silence doesn't get the respect it deserves until you listen to this ordeal, which sounds like a guy who leeched off a rich ex-girlfriend for money to dash off a talent-free album."
1,Miserably bad.,"This isn't even enjoyably bad a la Vanilla Ice. It's just BAD. It takes itself completely serious. There are no hooks, nothing that grabs you. The lyrics are generic - typical modern rapper singing about how much money he has. And of course we have to put up with lots of self-references about how ""da press hate me / cause I hooked up wit 'der pretty lady."" Get over yourself."
1,Kool Kutz,Hey Maaan-you all is missin' da point! This here's a case of the K-Fed releasin' some of his C-Rap! Pity there isn't a no-star rating!
2,Only good track of the CD,Yo I downloaded the album and I can say that America's most Hated is one of the most fire tracks of the year and the only good song on the album
1,What Could Be Worse Than A Britney Spears CD? Here's Your Answer...,"There's an intrinsic embarrassment I feel even writing these words, as if corporeal punishment is imminent for my gall in actually listening. But never a fool who wouldn't bestow a shot at redemption, I delved. Yes, some will hate for the mere act of hating; some will discharge and berate at the sheer mention of his name with nary a musical note heard. But, try, if you can, to hear without the gossip. Listen, as if a new artist is upon us. Then - and only then - do you have the right to criticize and the justice to recoil in the horror of it all. There isn't actually much to say except believe the anti-hype; believe every scintilla of negativity you might have read - this truly is all that's been written about it. Congratulations, Limp Bizkit - you no longer have the worst CD of the past five years. My grade: F"
1,Who writes this crap?,"Been on the west coast all my life,in love with her just like my wife,and in love with the Hennessey every damn night,hooked up with B--- it's about to get right.It's going down like a fresh pair of panties,Cab looked better than a couple pair of Grammy's.You understand me, the city is mine,so I do like the roll, I twist and wind.Grab your purse, hop in the two seater,I've got a stash spot big enough to fit two heaters,One for me, and one for my girl,Bonnie and Clyde ready to conquor the whole world.I got Gucci on, she got Prada,She calls me daddy, but she's not my daughter,And I'm not her father, I'm just a mack,I got tired of drugs so I switched to rap, like that.------------------------------I'm embarrased for him."
1,Go Britney!!!,"Britney finally dumped this thug....Can anyone blame her??? Kevin Federline is nothing but a piece of white trash trying to be somebody he will NEVER be. Using his wife's money to try and get somewhere. The only reason he is ever noticed is because he is mr. BRITNEY SPEARS. In one year he will be getting his car repoed again! If possible, he should get -5 stars, and I absolutely put stress on the NEGATIVE part."
1,"help, you're killing me here",I haven't listened to any of the songs on this CD and wouldn't after reading all of the feedback. What I am going to do right now is change the pants I wet after reading these reviews.
2,WOW,"I give this CD 2 stars...not because of the songs are good (they're horrible) but because this guy is the smartest guy on the planet....for one he picks up Britney Spears when she ""WAS"" in the prime of her life and in tip top quarter bouncing off the arse shape....rails her for a couple of of kids that some day he will get alimony money for....gets her to pay out of her pocket for his music ""career"" to start.........IMO this guy is the smartest white trash male on the planet.....his music just really really really rediculously sucks! (blue steel pose)"
5,Excelent book,"It is as complete and clear as it gets.I would recommend it to any one who wants to learn more about the history, the execution and the artistry of ballet."
4,Best ingredients for the price,"So far, this brand has the highest quality ingredients that I've found for this price level ($40). Beef meal, pork meal, decent grains like barley and rice, no wheat or corn or significant amounts of junk space fillers like brewer's rice or beet pulp. I supplement it with occasional plain chicken, vegetables, etc.My dog happily eats it all, but he's not exactly picky. He even stole some straight out of the bag at first. He passed a lot of gas while eating through the first bag (we mixed increasing amounts with his old food over about a week or two), but now on the 2nd bag of this Merrick, it's nothing major.I'm planning on rotating between the different Merrick flavors or possibly going with Merrick's value brand, Whole Earth, if I like the ingredients."
5,Take this book to Oaxaca!,"My copy of Oaxacan Woodcarving: The Magic in the Trees arrived just before my husband and I left the U.S. for a 3-month RV tour through several states of Mexico. Much of our 4 weeks in Oaxaca were spent in small villages enjoying the colorful works and the artisans who created them. We saw a wide variety of styles and themes, many of which are represented in this book. What gorgeous colors and what a sense of humor!"
3,"Great Photos, but not for Children","I purchased this book as a resource for my elementary school Spanish classes. The photos are excellent examples for our art projects with a few exceptions. Some of the pictures are painted nude or are half nude from the waist up. While not offensive to adults or an older audience, they are not really appropriate for all age groups.I disappointedly found myself ""defacing"" several of the photos by adding bikini tops and bottoms with a permanent marker. Better this than children seeing things they shouldn't and having to explain things that I would prefer not to do. Much better to draw tops and bottoms than parents calling me to complain about their children seeing things they shouldn't!So, make sure you preview all the pages before letting children see the photos. And, use your best judgment if you are a school teacher."
2,A book to skip,"While reading this book I went from loving it to disliking it rather quickly. The story moved very fast and kept my attention at the beginning, but it soon became..well a disappointment. Its hard to read a book that has such a dark qualities everywhere. I can't imagine the sun shinning at any point within this story! When I was through with the story I didn't learn anything about love, instead I felt like was tricked into reading a horrible romance novel. I honestly don't recommend this book. If you are in search of a good book with awesome characters I recommend ""I Know This Much Is True"" by Wally Lamb, or ""Where the Heart Is"" by Billie Letts. ""Here on Earth"" is one to skip."
2,Didn't draw me in,I love reading. I've read just about all of Oprah's pick and this one was the most disappointing. I didn't feel for March at anytime during the story. Hollis was presented as this complicated villian/hero who was only confusing at best. I don't think that the author gave us enough to actually care for anyone in the story at all. This was my first time reading a book by this author and probably the last.
4,"a sad, non-enviable place to be but so possible!","after reading reviews, it seems readers do not like the story b/c it is so tough to digest and yet, the story is so possible! of course people can be controlled by past lovers and un-resolved immature love! no matter what our age. Hollis represents someone who March has always felt needed protection and now, she has her chance, and in so doing, gives up her own identity. this is not only feasible but done on a daily basis by thousands of woman!! i was one! i know. It takes great strength to turn away and she just could not. Has anyone read ""Bastard out of Carolina""? there is another sad page turner about control. BUT IT HAPPENS!"
3,What a downer,I had to keep reading the book in hopes of something better for the characters. This book is intriging and dark. Many of the books I have read from Oprahs book club tend to lean toward the darker sides of life and this book is definately one of them.I may read one more book by Alice Hoffman just to see if all of her ideas are depressing or not. I thought this book was well written in the sense that I wanted to find out what did happen to the characters.
2,Disappointing,"This was my first Alice Hoffman novel. I think she is a good writer, and the story held my attention. (The similarities to Wuthering Heights are unmistakable... at least for a good part of the book.) But the ending was ridiculous, in my opinion.The main character sort of fades out of the story, as does her daughter. The book ends up being about three completely different characters than it's starts out (and continues for quite a while) being about.I must have missed something along the way, but I found the ending contrived, disappointing and flat.I also found the transformation of the daughter (and the main character as well) pretty far-fetched.All in all, I don't recommend the book."
2,About an inch away from a Danielle Steele Novel,"I'm surprised that this is an Oprah book. There's no depth to the characters or the plot. I feel no connection to their lives or decisions. Based on this novel, I would not read another Alice Hoffman book."
2,For those who did not enjoy Here on Earth...,Please do not give up on Alice Hoffman! I have read all of her books and found Here on Earth not to be up to her usual high standards. Please read Turtle Moon and Second Nature and of course Pratical Magic. You won't be disappointed !!
1,depressing,"I was very disappointed by this book. This was the first selection from Oprah's book club for me and I was left feeling very unsatisfied at the end. What lessons, if any, were learned by any of the characters? Hollis died, for what? This was not a moving story at all. Nothing but pain, regret and bad choices by the characters."
1,Blatant Wuthering Heights Rip Off!,"Character for character, plot for plot, ""Here on Earth"" is a blatant rip off of Charlotte Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights"". I was shocked and very dismayed to discover that a modern author with so many books to her credit would do such a thing! There is no mention ANYWHERE of the 'similarities', much less an acknowledgment of the novel as an 'adaptation'. It amounts to nothing less than PLAGERISM of a timeless classic. The author should be embarressed (I was embarressed for her while reading it.)"
4,This one got my imagation,This book got me to thinking what would happen if I went back to my old home. I found it very thought provoking.I usually read Oprah's book choices and was not disappointed. I have read it twice now.
2,Poor!,"I have read some of the reviews for this before writing my own. I am surprised that people think this is a knock-off. Not because the was a great and original story, but because it was so poor one would have thought a knock off from a classic would have be better. Anyhow, I didn't like this book at all... every character horrible. The scenes provided nothing but doom and gloom. This was cast somewhere in Mass, which I despised her using my great state for such a horrible peice of ""work"". If you have to read this, don't bother buying it. Save your money and go to the library."
3,"This book was a complete rip off of ""Wuthering Heights""","This is the first book by Alice Hoffman that I have read. The high school romance theory intrigued me. But, once I started to read the book I was completely struck by the similarity to Wuthering Heights. I didn't think that was allowed. Oh well, I guess the ending was different enough so as not to make Alice Hoffman guilty of complete plagiarism."
3,"Great page-turner, ambiguous ending","I couldn't put this book down. I was completely entranced by the story and how some of the charecters could live their lives in such a way. The charecters seemed real in the beginning, but the way in which many of their personalities literally spiraled out of control was intriguing, but a little unrealistic. There is no definitive ending and the reader is left with so many questions as to how these people that they have come to know and develop so many emotions for will end up.Basically, I loved the fastasy-like story line but hated how I was left wondering about the conclusion."
3,Unfinished,"Okay, but not one of the best books I've read. I was let down at the end as it seemed like the author just wanted to ""hurry up"" and finish the book. I would recommend it for a summer book, but expect to be let down at the end by the quick ending that leaves many loose ends and the reader wondering."
3,"Nearly direct re-telling of ""Wuthering Heights""","For an unoriginal premise (directly using the plot and characterizations of Emily Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights""), this is an interesting modernization of a literary classic that is too often simplified into a romance novel. One reader/reviewer here asked where else one could find such a riveting villain/hero as Hollis...go back to the original and read the real Heathcliff. (And remember, the beautiful film with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon covers only the first 19 chapters of Bronte's novel.)"
2,flat,"This was the first Hoffman book I have read. In short, I did not find any one of the characters likable or realistic. The plot was flat and did not pull me in to the story line. Really boring! In addition, is anyone else tired of ""love"" stories focusing on women cheating on their husbands (Bridges of Madison County, Horse Whisperer)? Unfortunately this particular story does not have the emotional depth necessary to pull off the plot line."
3,A good read at first,"I had never read a book by Alice Hoffman before, and I must say this hasn't dissuaded me from reading others. At first I really liked it, and was enthralled by the writing and the characters. Then I grew to find it almost distasteful. It seemed highly implausible that March would be so out of her head with love that she couldn't see what Hollis really was. His cruelty is shocking, and made me almost not finish the book. That she would nearly sacrifice her daughter, and her own self-worth, is hard to believe. The writing grew more pedestrian as the book progressed, as well. However, I would like to read Hoffman's earlier works."
1,like watching paint dry,"Is it just me? I am an avid reader, I know enough to give a book a really good shot before I flip it closed and say,""I cant take it anymore"" Im sorry, this book is in my opinion one of the worst books I have ever ""attempted"" to read. There is no ""draw"" nothing that keeps you interested, nothing to bring you back to the book to see what happens next. This book is painfully slow, it drolls on and on about nothing. The relationships are sketchy, the charachters are bland and the reference to animal abuse is offensive. I just dont get it. I think this is one of the worst books I have ever read."
2,disturbing,"At first, I thought the book was rather good, but when the guy starts going crazy, it made me upset. Not really my cup of tea."
1,"READ ""WUTHERING HEIGHTS"" INSTEAD.....PLEASE","At the end of the first chapter I knew what I was in for. This book is a terrible version of Wuthering Heights, one of my absolute favorites. It's not loosely based, its an updated version that didn't need to be written."
2,Severly disappointing!,"I started this novel with high hopes because I am an Alice Hoffman fan. I finished feeling disappointed and cheated. What I thought was going to be an inspiring novel about a feeling I have had myself left me feeling empy and unfulfilled. It seems Ms. Hoffman started this story with high hopes herself than didn't quite know how to capture the feelings of the characters and so turned Hollis into an obnoxious, abusive man and turned March into a totally unsympathetic character. Yes, love sometimes makes you blind to a person's true character and makes you turn a deaf ear to those you love most but March's total immersion into a man who could be so cold and cruel really alienated me from her. The ending was a cop out, an easy way to end a novel that made you feel like you had wasted time even reading the book. This book was a total rip-off of ""Wuthering Heights"" and my opinion is, if you can't improve on a classic, don't bother tryng."
1,A complete waste of my time,"Oprah, Oprah, what were you thinking putting this book on your list. The characters were bland, unbelievable, and not even remotely likeable. I'm on page 150 and I can't bear to go on. I've never stopped reading in the middle of a book, but this might have to be a first. People, save your money. You will gain nothing from this book. I wish I could get my money back."
4,Alice Hoffman Writes with Beauty Rarely Encountered,This book is typical Hoffman. It is filled with magical realism and darkness. It pulls at the reader like a full moon testing the tides of your emotions.The book focuses on the obsession of love. The love is hurtful and wrong but it pulls one towards it like a magnet despite the red flags and obvious dangers. Love may be blind but it is not immobile. It moves towards passion like a lemming towards a cliff.This is the heart and soul of many a Hoffman book. It is rare to encounter a writer as good and prolific as Alice Hoffman. She sees the beauty and magic in the mundane and through her writing we are privileged to see it as well.I highly recommend this book.
2,Help me understand...Please!,"I read this book based on Oprah's recommendations, but also because I was intrigued by the many mixed reviews posted on this site. After reading the book, the strangest thing happened; I just didn't know how to feel about it! Did the author intend for this book to be bad, just to force readers to stop and think and debate about its merits? The story was interesting, but the characters lacked...I don't know...everything? The whole background was dark, foreboding, and frankly, quite scary. Is New England really so bad, or just the town in which these feeble characters lived? Every single character in this book was moronic, immature, and full of self-pity. I hated them all! I'm surprised no one else has mentioned the rabbits to which the author referred at least fifty times. What's up with the rabbits? Do they rule the town? I found them quite frightening!"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. The premise and prose promised a story of complete characters living out a complex story full of interesting depth. But they all fall flat and the story became predictable about 1/2 way through. The drama Ms. Hoffman creates with her poetic descriptive prose overshadows the predictable plot. The characters originally seem much too smart to be caught in these circumstances, but by the end they've left you wondering what earth they were on here and why. You almost feel like this book was an outline for a much deeper study of human relationships. Too bad it didn't fulfill its promise."
1,Don't even think of buying this book!!,"Woman leaves her husband and neglects her daughter for abusive, abrasive loser. I was very disappointed in the author's portrayal of the ""Heroine"". Save your money."
1,What a bore...,"When I bought this book, I didn't expect great literature; but, I did expect a good love story. Yech! The characters are pathetic people who refuse to take charge of their lives. The storyline is so predictable you might as well watch TV."
2,"Simply, superficial, shallow","I glad a friend loaned it to me, otherwise I would have wasted my own money. Reads quick, and keeps your interest, but offers nothing lasting."
1,Dont waste your time with this one!,"After reading all the reviews for this book, I was really excited to read it. Boy, was I disappointed! This is a stupid book full of insipid, fully unlikeable characters. There was no one even remotely appealing. And I did not understand this great ""love"" between March and Hollis, as it did not seem to be anything except lust, even from the beginning. If you still must read this book, get it from the library. That way you still may lose several hours of your life reading it, but at least you wont waste any money. Just make sure you return it on time as it is not worth the 5 cents a day overdue fees."
2,Talent but no genius...,"I'm not bothered by the similarity to Wuthering Heights; it's obvious that Hoffman was attempting an homage, rather than crude plagiarism. However, Hoffman is definitely not the writer E. Bronte was. Cathy and Heathcliff have a mythic power about them which lends a sort of awe-inspiring greatness to even their worst excesses. Hoffman aims for that and fails; she has produced a dreary woman-in-danger tale, not significantly different from a thousand others easily found on drugstore shelves."
5,Every woman should read this book,"Any young woman about to go into the dating world should read this book. Hollis can teach alot about what kind of man not to date, and March shows what kind of woman no one should be. This book could give women involved in a manipulative relationship the courage to get out. Thanks Oprah for this recommended read."
3,Rember your first love all over again,Great story about the sometimes difficult choices one must make as an adult. The characters were very real. A great weekend book.
2,Dark,"It is not one of the best books I've read this year. It is okay at best. I am sure that there are hidden meanings to some of the writing, I wasn't interested enough to really dig deep."
4,"intense,written with beautiful prose in gothic tradition","I was totally captivated by the book. I felt it spoke more about obsession than any book I have read. I see the comparisons to Wuthering Heights,but fail to see that as a crime. There are seven basic plots and the telling of the same story line in a new manner is allowed! I was surprised that more readers did not comment on the beautiful prose. More than the characters;the discriptions of emotions and the barren land that reflects the emotions, make it an important book to me. Such writting as"" the laughter falls on the ice and onto the sidewalk, where it cracks open into silence."" will compell me to read much more by Alice Hoffman . I do agree with your readers on the point that Oprah's reading picks are all depressing,but because they all exhibit such fine writing,I read them and usually am very pleased."
3,Don't Judge a Book by Its Cover,"This book jumped into my shopping cart because it was one of Oprah's book club selections. No I don't belong to the OBC religion, but I did use it as a guide that this might be a book worth reading to learn how I like the author in general. The book droned on endlessly for the first three quarters, then it seemed to pick up some momentum to fall flat as a pancake, abruptly ending with way too many ends not tied up. I hated the character Hollis, so that means she did a good job of creating him, but the other characters were very disappointing, even boring. It seemed like a cookie-cutter plot that was not developed nearly as much as it should have been. I can't say I won't read another of her books, but this wasn't the best introduction to this author."
1,simply awful,"very trite, poorly written (sophomoric writing style with cliche flair) and weak plot that was fairly predictable. extremely disappointing and can't believe i wasted my time reading this."
1,junk,complete compact carrying case for computer and peripherals as well. It contains plenty of pockets for other items;good price too.On second thought the stitching started to tear apart after one month.I would not buy another. Avoid it.
2,Almost perfect except for durability,"> As other reviewers have noted, the fake leather that attached the handle and strap to the case started tearing after a few months.> I purchased it in September 2008 for 26.99 plus shipping. There is probably a better price out there than $110.00 I definitely can't recommend it at that price.> The configuration of compartments is great. At the right price (under $30) I would recommend it more for protection and storage of accessories. If you are going to carry it more than a few times a month, it is probably not the case for you because of it lack of durability."
1,Very poor construction,I purchased this case because it looked very functional...To my surprise the rivets popped out and the zipper broke about two weeks into it's use. I have never been disappointed by a Sampsonite product until now. I have written to them and received no communication in return!
5,Very good fit,"This notebook case is a very very good and sleek fit for 14"" notebooks. Although it might not accommodate much items other than laptop requirements but it is still very very good."
2,Good looking - cheaply made,"Got this very compact and good looking laptop case for about a month. Well, this morning the shoulder strap ripped from the side of the case. No more shoulder strap for me, handle only from now on. I guess it was worth every single one of the 31 bucks I paid for it."
4,"Well made, but a little small","This bag is well put together for a basic laptop case. It is, however, a bit on the small side. Finding a good spot for the power supply isn't easy.All in all, a good bag for the money."
2,Safe with Samsonite,"This notebook case by Samsonite is the perfect size for my Dell Latitude D610 laptop, mouse, powercord and internet ""patch cable"". The handy flap on the back made it very easy to slip over the handle of my wheeled carry-on thus easing the burden as I hiked from one end the airport to the other to make a connection. In addition to the laptop I was also able to pack a few folders, a pad and a few pens along with my cell phone and PDA. Definitely big enough to do the job but not so big as to be cumbersome. If you need a great little bag, this is the one!!"
5,Great CD!,"This is the best compilation of songs by a new band in a very long time. Straight ahead hard rock...like it used to be! Great album, great songs. I love it!"
5,Works for me,"I bought this cable after experiencing complete failure from a much cheaper alternative, and I was not disappointed. The cable pulls well from the box, the colors are easy to identify, and all of the runs I made (about 10 through the walls of my home) are working great at gigabit speeds."
4,delivers the power,Probably took 45 min. The sound is great. Did not get good mileage til I quit mashing that peddle. '97 4.6 ltr. ford expedition 4x4.
5,"If you can't change your situation, change your attitude","The Chapter 4 lifesavers have been a consistent source of getting me out of neurochemical depresson for years. I too have given away over 30 copies since 1975 when I found it. Hippie bookstore owner said it was the only philosophy of living book or religion he'd read that he couldn't find anything wrong with. Ditto for me. ""What was it that you thought needed to be loved?"" And the heavens opened and the light shone down. Need a copy again badly!"
3,Book,"Book was much, much smaller than expected for the price. Good information in it, but not a very good value for the money."
5,The great hits of a comic genius,"For those who don't know the original ""Wierd Al,"" Allan Sherman, or know him only as the man who wrote ""Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh,"" this CD is a revelation and a true tribute to a comic genius. Unlike his discovery, Bill Cosby, Allan Sherman is all but forgotten by everyone except his many diehard fans. And that's a shame, for, in his own way, his was as great a talent as Cosby's. And, on a personal note, whenever I want a good laugh, this CD gets me going every time. Yes, ""Hello Muddah"" is here, as it should be. But so is ""Sarah Jackman"" (supposedly a favorite of JFK), ""Lotsa Luck,"" ""Al 'n' Yetta,"" ""Good Advice,"" ""Crazy Downtown,"" and ""Schticks of One and a Half Dozen of the Other,"" all of them comic gems. Steve Allan's liner notes are merely the icing on the cake. In short, this is a funny tribute to a very funny man who left us too soon. Camp Grenada forever!"
2,too many viewpoints,This was a potentually interesting book. unfortunately the author tried to use too many viewpoints (5 characters) to tell the story. the result was a disjointed overly complicated and unfortunately unsuccessful writing style. on the other hand there is an interesting glimpse of a possible future that is wasted on this book but shows how the future might be and how it might not be different from our world.
5,A Brilliant Sci-Fi Thriller,"This is my first time reading L.E. Modesitt, Jr.'s work, and I'm blown away by this author's creative melding of art, science, commerce, and politics into a highly entertaining crime story.Proceeding slowly at first, Archform: Beauty explores the every day lives of 5 very different individuals (music teacher/singer, police investigator, powerful senator, proficient news researcher, and ruthless businessman). The story picks up steam as the police officer investigates a series of fatal accidents, and all five protagonists are connected in some way. Yet, the investigation is really secondary for the author, whose focus is more on what our world will look like in the 2400s. Mondesitt's prognostication for our future is both somber and inspiring.Archform: Beauty is a fascinating read for sci-fi and mystery fans alike."
1,Not all original hit recordings!,"I bought this CD for a few songs on it,especially for the Nashville Teens version of ""Tobacco Road"".It may be some version of the Teens but their rendition here sounds like a 3 A.M. bar date at an all-night roadhouse,with a sloppy vocal,no harmonies and without the crisp propulsion of the single.Be warned-if you want the hit,look elsewhere."
4,Informative book,Very thorough and at times difficult to understand. It's a great reference book to have when doing research and understanding how to be a good consumer of research.
2,Fishing Oregon,"While the book contained some usefull information, I found out more about my visit by visiting one fly shop."
2,not for beginners,"This is not a book for beginners. Not for beginning programmers, and not for advanced programmers who don't know much about XSLT. An introductory chapter or two explaining XSLT, and maybe a few really simple examples (10-20 lines each), would have gone a long way towards making this book more useful. If you already know XSLT pretty well, though, this could provide some useful sample code."
3,Ouch!,"Positives first - The cable was well packed and easy to pull from the box. Sturdy cable for standard wiring.Negatives - The plastic on the individual wires is rough, and if you will be working with this all day, you'll find your fingertips raw. The individual wires are also very stiff and hard to manipulate."
2,Unhappy,"The set arrived but one of them have something loose and rattling inside. The other one is broken in the corner.Don't know the quality of the sound, as I haven't hooked it up, but it's very disappointing to receive such a product.It is my second ""unhappy"" experience with PYLE speakers. The first speaker set from PYLE was also defective. Am I unlucky or is there something wrong with the product line, OR the crew at the Amazon warehouse maltreated my speakers badly before shipping them to me.???"
1,Pyle 3inch cube speakers,Returned shipment. One speaker the plastic case was broken and the other speaker did not work. Poor quality by manufacturer.
4,3 inch mini cube speakers,"These little speakers are just what I wanted. I have an old stereo set that plays tapes, cds and lp records. It is now out of the attic and ready to bring me back to past times. The speakers work fine for this set."
4,Pyle 3-inch Speakers,"The speakers work fine for my purposes. They are used to play music at a low volume or listen to talk or news. My stereo receiver puts out a maximum of 20 watts per channel which the speakers handle easily. The speakers don't have much bass response of course, so if you want fuller sound consider adding a subwoofer."
3,A Review,"Ok, so I ordered this product under the impression that it used RCA cords that most devices use to connect to the TV. I was wrong. They use bare wire connectors, so to hook them up to your TV you need a surround sound system receiver because I was told there is no way to connect the speakers directly to the TV (even if you get connectors that allow you to do so; I was told that a receiver to transition/convert the sound).I got the item quickly and nothing was broken. They felt heavy and compact for being so small, and so I knew they were of decent quality. I think that if you have a receiver and the cords to connect the speakers, then these would be great; but I could not use them, so don't take my word on it. They just seemed well-built.Overall, a good product and good shipping, but the wires that they suggest you buy with the speakers and the lack of specs and other pictures is misleading. Be careful and sure that this is what you are looking for before you buy them."
2,Not great sounding,"These speakers are just built for the worng application. They are too small for anything other than a very small accent speaker in a surround computer system - but they are too small to carry any bass response at all. I love Pyle products, but these just miss the mark"
4,Good value for price,"Bare bones but adequate and compact replacement for much larger speakers, hooked to a tuner used primarily for listening to FM radio. Lacking in ""room vibrating"" bass, but a very economical space-saver.BARE WIRE CONNECTORS; would typically require adapter connectors, soldering, etc., for use as computer speakers."
4,Nice basic speakers,"I needed to create an inexpensive surround system for a room that we don't use very often. I bought three pairs of these speakers. I used two of them to create the center channel, and then used the other four for the front R/L and the rear R/L. I'm really surprised how nicely the sound worked out. Even though this room is kind of big, these basic speakers create a nice sound and fill it up just fine. I used a decent subwoofer and was afraid that the difference between the cheap speakers and the rich sub would create an uneven tone, but the highs and lows blend just fine.For the price, I'm happy with these speakers."
5,Awesome Old Tech for new Tech Laptop or Desktop,Works no problems. Win 7 Pro loads driver plug n play. Creates full LPT & COM Drivers for whatever comm device needed whether printer or modem or other. Great addition to keep using old tech with the new Laptops and Desktops and Slates.
4,VAN TUYL GENEOLOGYFOR SEVERAL FAMILIES WITH TIES TO THE VANTUYLS,"Wonderful resource for information on the Van Tuyl, McCarter and families related to them. Very thorough - a little confusing, however, as it jumps around a lot. I must say that Ms. Bowman did a great deal of research and really saved me time in my research."
4,Sweet soundtrack,"I think that this soundtrack is amazing, especially the Amanda Ghost song. I love the way Rock DJ is worked into the mix, and I think that almost all good songs from the movie were included. However, I would love to know what the name of the song/artist is that Keanu Reeve's is working out to in the beginning of the movie. That one should have been included on the soundtrack, too!! An excellent, eclectic listen..."
4,"Good variety, great songs","This soundtrack fit with the movie really well. It's mellow (especially with the Enya track;) I've found I like having it on in the background in the evening. The Stevie Nicks and kd lang songs are great. The Bare Naked Ladies also have a good song on here, which is cool. Guys - you know how the movie's a chick flick? Well this album is pretty much a chick-album. What I like about this album is that it fits with a romantic San Francisco (which is what this movie portrays) - some new stuff, some old stuff, all kind of eclectic. If you want to relive the real mood of the movie, this is a good album."
2,it's not all bad,"It seems that either you love this album or you hate it. There are some laughably bad songs (Roseanna, I Won't Hold You Back) on this album - although I can't say I was any too amused in the early eighties when Africa seemed to be playing everywhere I went. However, there are a couple of songs here that break away from this mold, namely 99 and Georgie Porgie which actually have some soul. (Whether the fact that the latter is currently being ripped off by some hip hoppers makes them any more legit is certainly debatable). I give one star for each of these songs, and if I could, I would give another half star for Hold the Line, a guilty pleasure that reminds me of junior high."
5,Masterpiece,"This cd is one of the greatest ever. He's got all you ask for in a cd, good ballads and great pop. Toto is the best group ever and by listening to Past to present you'll probably agree with me. You wont be dissapointed."
3,merrick dog food,the amazon price differed from shippers invoice price....a little clumsy with tracking of market place purchases but in the end it arrived after a few calls. my dog-mixed breed large dog- loves this product.
3,Not bad at all / It would get 3 1/2 Stars....,"After the first listen, I was hooked. Overall the song writing is good and the theme is very good. I like it better than DFTW and almost as much as UHT. Its not as good as the first WASP/Headless/Crimson/UHT, but it is better, much better then KFD/Helldorado/DFTW/Inside/Last Command/Still not black enough. Blackie and the guys did well on this release. It is heavy, melodic and in your face rock n roll! I can not wait for the North American tour here in Austin."
4,WHO?,"I've been a W.A.S.P. fan since thier first album (yeah I'm that old) and to me this is still a vallid disc. Blackie's always had an intense kind of voice and in my opinion he's just as gripping as when I first heard Animal. Also when I read some of the other reviews I noticed that in all of the trpical comparisons nobody mentioned the Who (Tommy ,Quadrophenia) I've never heard anyone other than Blackie (Crimson Idol included) pull that off without sounding like COMPLETE trash , good job Blackie"
2,Waste of money and time,"In my opinion no W.A.S.P. album is better than the Crimosn Idol.Being a huge Blackie's fan, I can only rate it as a two star album. It sounds a little like Still not Black Enough, but the music is just not there.Buy it only if you're a fan and just want to have all of the W.A.S.P. records for collection."
1,Dont buy,I didnt have much weight to loose just wanted a little extra help. I have twice the size belly now as i did to begin with I haven't changed eating habits or anything I was very disappointed I would not recomend this at all!
1,Make me sick...,"I took this for only one day! It made me feel really light headed and weird. I have 20 pds that I need to loose and I just wanted something to help me. I liked the fact that it has a lot of natural herbs and stress is a huge factor for me but it made me really sleepy. Maybe this will work for some people, just not for me....."
4,Good basic regulator bag,This bag was a solid inexpensive regulator bag. The bag is large enough for one regulator set. It is basic with an internal pocket and not much else. It would have been nice to have some tie downs inside the bag but for the price it serves its purpose well. I'm alittle concerned about how dirty the white stripe will get on the front. I'll report more about that after a few uses.
3,Mesmer Review,"I was suprised at this movie. Alan Rickman was alive when he interacted with certain characters but some of the other characters were stilted. I thought that this was a little sterilized for public consumption. When he was treating his patients, the patients were alive and Alan Rickman matched their intensity."
4,Mesmerizing Story of Early Hypnosis!,"This is a fascinating movie for any student/practitioner of hypnosis or hypnotherapy. Alan Rickman is wonderful as Dr. Mesmer, the Austrian physician credited as the ""Father of Hypnotism"". Rickman captures the nuances of ""waking"" suggestion perfectly, using his voice and touch to produce trance state in his patients.(Eg. ""Ladies, don't be surprised if you should swoon!"") Particularly interesting is his experimental treatment of hysterical blindness which culminates in the accidental discovery that the ""shock/surprise factor"" is necessary to effect the desired healing. A lot of this is going to be missed by casual viewers who lack an understanding of hypnotism. But, Rickman plays a Mesmer who is, himself, struggling to understand the marvelous techniques he is discovering. His efforts fail at least as often as he succeeds. This makes him a sympathetic, if enigmatic character. Not a movie for the masses, but I loved it!"
3,Not the book expected,"I'm not going to tell you the book is terrible, because it isn't. It's just that I expected a book that would explain things better. How can a book have a chapter on Data and Data Binding and not even show you how to go about creating a new record in a DB or updating a record. The book is not cool, the technology is... since the book gives you a little taste of it, you feel this book is cool. Just Because I'm writing this doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it... all i'm saying is that it could be much better and that i can't way for the next full-version book."
3,It *was* good as an intro to ASP.NET,"I enjoyed getting this book so early on in the .NET beta. Obviously superceded now, and full of repetitive sections, but with no competition it was a winner! ;-)"
4,"Jip, a character who will make you cry","Jip, his story is a book for children and young adults. Again Katherine Paterson does her best to offer her readers a really touching story.Jip, the cental character, is an orphan who suffers from the cruelty of all adults around him in his struggle to discover his real identity. His adventures, his metaphorical journey towards self - identification captures the reader from the very beginning.It's a historically accurate story placed in Vermont, in the mid 19th century. It presents vividly this dark period of America, dealing with the major theme of slavery and man's quest for freedom.Undoubtedly, it's a novel which not only entertains but also informs and makes people think ..."
3,Enjoyed reading this book.,"When I read Jip: His Story, I thought that it was very interresting once I got through the third or even the fourth chapter. The scene's really caught my attention, and were very bizarre (In a good way). I enjoyed reading this story. It's worth the time to read it.-Bridget E."
4,Caitlyn,I found Jip: His Story a story that could keep you on your toes. There were times where the author did a very well job of describing and i could almost feel the emotion. I could completly understand the emothion and even imagine it.
4,Great DVD,"Great DVD. Purchased it to see Stan Explain via video the techniques he teaches in his books, the Art of the Short Game and the Art of Putting. Its a video of Mr. Utley, Mr. Hardy, and Mr. Cook speaking at a summit or convention.Found the portion on Utley to be really really helpful. I was also pleasantly surprised by Mr. Hardy's explanations of the 1 and 2 plane swings. I had heard his theories before, but didn't really understand them until watching this DVD. I've since purchased his DVD's and books. And still find this DVD to be he best of the bunch when it comes to simply explaining the two swings and why someone would choose to try one over the other.I agree with the first poster, the only thing that would be better is if they could have had some shots of actual swings using either Mr. Hardy or Mr. Utley's techniques. All in all found the video to be a great addition to my library.GM"
4,Works great,"Works fine, just as decribed can fit all differant sizes of vac hoses can cut to lengh nice product if your not sure of the sizes your trying to mate"
5,a cd for you,"WOW this band is so awsume, SERIOUSLY if you are an emo fan you need pick up this cd and support this band that is already becoming bigger and bigger every day..i saw them when they came to fresno and hung out with the band(mostly the lead singer) and their just the coolest people ever, so down to earth and deserving of success.with all the imitations of good emo these days, these guys have what it takes, so GET THIS CD! lol"
2,Depressing Movie,"Depressing movie, wish I didn't waste my time. Hope you don't waste yours. Actress is good, but movie is not."
2,Strange,One would have to watch it half a dozen times I reckon to undertand and take in the full understanding of the movie. I have watche dit twice now and still find it hard to stay to the end. May pleae some but not me.
4,True to life,"That's me in the cattle auction scene, wearing my black, Vietnam cap, & the old, brown Hillbilly hat in the bar scene. Other than that, Sundance doesn't hand-out their top awards to just any film! This movie tells it like it is! If you're looking for disgusting language, you won't find it! If you're looking for blood & guts...you won't find it! If you're looking for nudity or steamy sex scenes...you won't find it! If you're looking for a well-writen, true-to-life depiction of a young girl's struggle to save her family, that's ""Winter's Bone."" This film is done with taste, complimented by excellent writing, directing, & acting skills."
3,interesting but stereotypical,"I found the movie to be interesting enough, following Ree's quest to find out what happened to her father and the people she meets along the way. It was certainly atmospheric and the acting, from the lead characters at least, was affective. The music was also very good. However, I did find the movie to be somewhat of a stereotype of poor mountain southerners, with the brutal men, often beaten down women, meth labs instead of moonshine and implications of a hopelessly closed inbred society. Certainly there are people like this, but did we need so many in one movie? I also found some holes in the plots involving the characters changing relationships with each other, which aren't always explained or make sense. The movie is worth seeing but I don't think it deserves all the hype it has received."
1,One note.,"A movie with very little to offer than one note. Scratch that, two notes: the root and minor third. By the time the buzzards make their debut, you don't have to be an art house baret-wearing clown from New York to see what this is all about: poor white folk. Toothless, gray, American Gothic meets the Joads meets Boys Don't Cry, etc. If it wasn't presented with such ham-fisted drudgery, perhaps with a tinge of humor or a sense of salvation (not the cheap kind that just comes at the end), it would have done the photography justice.In short, white poverty, meth, bad teeth, poor, banjo, squirrel gets skinned and eaten, bad teeth ad infinitum. Almost a parody of itself."
2,watching movies with the Silver Surfer,"its like a Lifetime cable channel movie..if you know what i mean...not bad, but not a thriller ..dont believe the 4 or 5 star reviews"
5,Hillbilly Heroin...,"Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic in WINTER'S BONE, a drama about her fight to protect her family while clearing the name of her father (among meth cookers). Stark and chilling, WB takes us deep into a rural labyrinth of drugs, murder, and twisted loyalties. Filled w/ tension, terror, and sorrow, this film is strong throughout, w/ a supporting cast of realistic folks and unpredictable characters. Highly recommended..."
1,Terrible,Don't waste your time. This movie was very boring. Anyone who gave this more than one star is probably boring also.
1,Poor White Trash,"This movie is a rather disheartening portrayal of the life of a young woman in an area of the hills where there is a lot of whiskey produced but very little trust. Although there is a bit of encouragement at the very end, life for her is rather thankless. Her only joy comes from two younger siblings. Winter's Bone will certainly not make you feel good."
1,Winter's Bone,"This a heart-breaking and heart-warming story of a young girl's fight to save her mother, brother and sister from the elements of poverty. Very well done. As everything I ordered this on line from Amazon.com."
4,Nicely executed......,"Now here's a neat trick: using severed limbs as currency, see ifyou can offer to pay off your mortgage/loan/overdraft at the bank.This was a beautifully shot,neatly directed and edited film withunderstated performances all round.Lawrence's performance is a real stand-out - reminiscent to thiswriter of Abbie Cornish in 'Somersault.' The landscape (both ofthe film and the scenery) is breathtaking and whilst I understandhow some may feel this film stereotyped the good folk of the Ozarks,I still won't have that place near my top 1,000,000 places to visitanytime soon.Whilst not nearly as gruesome as, say, 'Fargo' there was sufficientblood-curdling footage to make me want to puke.I could, perhaps, dump that on my bank manager's desk instead!"
2,"""Frozen River Revisited""","Great Movies are very uncommon. When I read great comments about a movie I feel very exited and full of hope. And usually I feel dissapointed, I remember when there were great comments about ""Frozen River"" and I feel strongly disapointed, it was a mediocre movie really. ""Winter's bone"" is exactly: same great comments, same type of movie, same type of dissapointed, same boring topics. Why people loves the human misery in a snow emvironment, with lot of people full of disgrace?"
1,"What's ""new"" about this NEW Winters Bone?","I'd like to know what's different about this blu-ray edition from the earlier one. I can't seem to find the run time on it. I'm desperately looking for the original DVD that I rented through Red Box which had a run time of about 143 minutes. The current DVD (which I unwittingly bought)and blu-ray offered on Amazon is a later version that is cut to 100 minutes. In my opinion 43 minutes of valuable footage was cut for what I reason I can't fathom.If this NEW blu-ray version has the complete footage, I'd snap it up. Does anyone know?"
4,Winter's Bone: A review,"A rural n'er-do-well with several dependants goes missing whilst on bail - it falls to his eldest daughter to make good on the amount of said bail - or forfeit the family home.Her attempts to locate her father - who might be hiding among her own extended family of sinister outlaws - proove to be more harrowing than she had expected.The performances are quite within measure for the 'types' portrayed, the dialogue is realistic as is the action and motivation of the various characters.Essentially a melodrama that might have been set as a costume piece, but here the expositional element is 'crank' - instead of 'bank robbery' - or 'moonshine' - or even 'weed' just two or three decades ago, I found this film to be compelling, and I would have no reservations in recommending it to anyone who enjoys Westerns."
4,"Pretty good, but bleak",Pretty good film about some white trash in some southern mountains. The acting is good and the story line is interesting. I like that the film depicts poor people without pushing any social message to the audience. There is no need for some left-wing explanation. We understand that life in this community is hard by just watching and listening. That makes the film so much more impactful
4,Good value,"I have been very satisfied with these speakers which I have been using while working at my computer. These were replacements for Altec-Lansing speakers that were stolen from my home along with my old computer. The old speakers were OK, but these Audioengines are much better. I am hard to please because I listen mainly to classical music, which requires better quality speakers to really enjoy. That's particularly true of orchestral works and other compositions involving violins, which sound shrill on cheap speakers. In comparison to truly expensive speakers (costing, say, over $1000 a pair), even these speakers will disappoint a classical music connoiseur, but for working at my computer they are just fine for me."
4,Powerful Lows & Blissful Highs,"These are the first high-end speakers that I've ever purchased before, so keep that in mind. I wanted speakers that were going to reproduce accurate sound for video editing (I'm a film student) as well as enjoying music. These speakers do just what I wanted. The burn-in time is real; it takes a while for the speakers to really open up, but once they do, it's great. I went ahead and got a Pioneer sub to pair with the speakers, but in all honesty, they really don't need it. The bass is tight, the highs are sweet but not quite as high as prominent as I'd like. They're pretty powerful speakers, but don't expect them to completely surround you in a large room. I'd recommend getting the stands for these if you're looking to work with them at a close range. I haven't had the heat issue that others have mentioned, but be sure to give these speakers room to ventilate. The construction is phenomenal; I can see why Audioengine is proud of their products."
2,It's not original!,It's so disappointing to have to listen to Harry Connick mangling the original songs by these greatest vocalists....
5,Great CD - Too bad it took almost 5 months before I heard it,"Perhaps its because George recorded this one on his own independent record label. Who knows... However, had I not been out to LA (where I heard it played often) I would not have even know about the CD as it has gotten no airplay on any stations in the New York area. At least I have not heard anything yet! What a shame. The world of Jazz has been so tired and boring lately and this is the shot in the arm it needed. Cool and funky innovative grooves throughout with some nice contemporary jazz songs. It's a shame I don't hear it in NY. Also, I was a little disappointed with the liner notes - no copyright date information or the kind of information you would like to see on each song, but overall, a really a great CD to add to your collection."
5,Hilarious! Really. I'm still enjoying it.,"I read this months ago. It was funny, very clever, I laughed etc. Now, I keep finding things in it I didn't notice before. Was just thinking about Purim, leafed through the book again, and discovered ""Glengarry Glen Purim,"" a ""David Mamet Purim Play."" The Passover Chapter has a Cole Porter version of one of the Passover songs. This is truly funny! Anyone who is offended should get over it -- it's classic satire, and much more intelligent than most other Jewish humor these days"
4,Capote,"Those who remember Truman Capote as the guy who wrote ""In Cold Blood"" should read these sweet, charming stories about a kid growing up in the South.It will change your view of his writing. I think I understand, now, why his work is so popular. It is uniquely American and varies as much as America did during his lifetime."
1,Wasted 9.99$,"These stories are lovely and well worth reading. However they're all present in ""The Complete Stories of Truman Capote"" from the same publishing house for only 2$ more, which, wanting to read more, I realised a mere hour later, after reading the first two stories. I got the other book of course, and so spent 9.99$ on this for nothing! I should have taken more time perusing before doing my purchase but I was so excited to see Truman Capote books finally available for the Kindle."
3,Disappointed,Perhaps I was expecting too much. This Christmas story left me unexpectedly flat. There are many more uplifting stories than this one. The ending left me - What??? Is that all there is?
4,Truman Capote collection of short stories,"Lovely collection of 3 short stories from Capote's childhood. Sweet but not sentimental - I can see the seeds of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""by Harper Lee, Truman's childhood friend and neighbor."
5,ORIGIONAL AND UNIQUE,This cookbook does what many others have been unable or unwilling to do. It takes the reader on a senstive journey through South Africas beautiful people and the cuisine in a delightful pictorial way. Lehla is a great artist and a great chef. Lets hope she does many more books
4,Cat5E,"Good quality. I have used ""cables to go"" bulk cable for years. pulls out nicely, no snags even when pulling runs my self.Found out later that I could have saved money and bough it at lowes, because this stuff is heavy and expensive to ship."

1,Caliente,Caliente ella. Nada más sabe actuar con playback. Eso sí está muy buena y anda con el presidente de Sony music por puro interés.
5,Buy skil blade,"I have tried the other 5 1/2 with the arbor adaptors. I hate them. They wear out, the slip off to the side. They suck. These are the best blade for your Skil HD saw.."
5,Excellent resource!,Besant lays forth in clear and precise terms the theosophic tenets of our multidimensional being. Astounding information for its time as well as for those today embarking on the esoteric path.
1,I hate amazon.com,"I watched this movie on tv, thought it was awesome, and ordered the vhs from amazon for $9.95. That was in October, it was backordered for FOUR MONTHS, and just recently amazon decided to cancel my order for me. The price now, just days after my order was cancelled, is $35.95!! This practice should be illegal, I think someone should be thrown in jail for this."
4,The Sebastian Sisters.,"I liked it. In order to get the full benefit I think you should read them all, starting with Evvie, and going down in order of age of the girls. Meg is actually their mother. The beginning was a little much to take, when they just fell in love so suddenly, and their aunt was so unbelievably strict. It was almost silly how strict she made the circumstances. No, it was silly. But you need to remember that this was a while ago. Towards the end I started to get into it, and above everything, I think she should have written more about what Meg and Nick's life was like before their children, and after they get away from her aunt. Some of the story was a little too unbelievable (Meg was going to be sent to a sanitarium for falling in love). So I think she should have elaborated more, maybe in a new book because she could get some interesting stories developing."
4,"Good, but now what i need it","I don't know if it was my mistake or the company, but I needed an Ethernet connection not and USB connector."
1,Disappointing,"After seeing the magnificent work of Bocklin on the internet, I was looking forward to this book, but......it doesn't have what I think is his best work, ""Pan Among The Reeds"", or ""Nymphs Bathing"", or ""Sanctuary Of Hercules"", or......etc!! The reproduction of ""Sacred Wood"", surely one of his best works, is so tiny I wonder why they (the people who made the book) even bothered to include it. On the other hand, ""Isle Of The Dead"" is given far too much space. It's not that I don't like the picture, but 3 reproductions of the same version, and 4 blowups of sections of same, is overdoing it, The latter might have been a good idea if the printing was of better quality.What works are included in this book dismally fail to take you into the fantastic world that Bocklin created. I can appreciate that this book was made to a price standard, but the omission of so many (in my opinion) major works is unforgiveable. To all Bocklin fans: don't bother with this one unless you're desperate."

5,Best money ever spent,"I've been in the market for a quality pair of earphones for about a year. I've gone to many stores to test out different brands. I've read many many reviews on all different types. I got my Jbuds yesterday and couldn't be happier. I went to the gym, went running, drove with them on, and slept with them on. I'm using them as I type right now. Not a single problem. Not once did they fall out of my ear. The comfort was perfect. I have told all of my friends and family with ipods to order a pair of jbuds. It was the best money I have spent and I am overjoyed with them. THANKS JBUDS. Get yourself a pair now."
1,Worked Great for 2 Months,"The ear buds worked great for two months. After two months the sound started cutting in and out on one side. Now the right side works sometimes, but is starting to cut in and out as well. On the positive side, they are very comfortable and fit my tiny ears :)"
2,IT BROKE SO QUICKLY!,"I had expected this pair of buds to last at least a year. Well, I was COMPLETELY wrong. After using it with care for two months, the left earbud STOPPED WORKING. I was really disappointed by it, and I had to buy a new pair of earbuds. Other than this, however, other aspects of it are good: good price, good sound quality, and good fit. Just wish that it had lasted longer. I didn't invest in a $5 per month earbud =[."
1,JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black) JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black),Awful. They do not stay in my ears. The little hole eventually get clogged with ear wax. Do not buy. Nothing good to say
4,REALLY PLEASED,"I have severe hearing loss and have been without the true sound of music for TOO long. I bought a Kindle Fire and got the JBUDS in hopes of hearing music again. I nearly cried to hear classical music again, it was amazing!! Thanks so much!!!!:} C.C."
4,Cheap and Good,These are cheap and good phones. Good bass quality (a little too much sometimes). Can't beat them for the price.
3,Comfortable but Not Reliable,"They're comfortable, but not reliable. Sometimes I get sound out of both ears, sometimes I don't. I've only had them a few weeks and expected much more."
3,Not as good as others i've owned,"This is the third pair of ear buds i've owned. I listen to a lot of audio at work, including music and spoken word. I have given them plenty of time to get worn in, but the sound quality on the jlabs is still terrible. I cannot use these for spoken word. I have started to use my old JVC pair. The JVCs cord is completely stripped to the wires, but they are that much better. The sound quality of the panasonic pair i had was the best and by far the most comfortable. These earbuds have generally last about 1 year for me. I just ordered a pair of Sony headphones, hopefully the sound quality will be better.I would not buy these again..."
3,Nice for the price,"Not much to say other than they seem to be one of the few products that bridge the gap between cheapie $10 ear buds and the $100+ high-end models. Although the bass is not as good as what I'd hear from a set of good speakers, they certainly sound better than the ones that came with the iPod and are probably almost as good as my 52-year-old ears would need to be happy."
2,"Terrible sound, regular noise reduction",Buy Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds instead! Bass is terrible and noise reduction is not that great. Should be a lot cheaper since quality is inferior to competitors.
3,Do it safely,"As a music enthusiast, I wanted see how these in-ear canal headphones do. Well, they were very dissapointing. There seems to be a new standard in headphones that provide a ""SAFE"" volume level that is incapable of damaging your ears. The sound was all there, mind you. Bass, treble, mid. But it lacks pop, oomph. There just clearly isnt enough air for good vibrations to occur in these headphonesPROS: Definately good for keeping outside noise to a minumum, great for planes, loud settings.CONS: Just get better headphones, they dont even stay in your ears if you give the cord a tug."
1,Total waste of money!,"This product is worthless. With gentle use (i.e. only 2-3 a week) one of the buds stopped working. I ordered another one thinking the first one was defective, same thing happened to the second one after couple of months. Move on and don't waste your money"
2,doesn't work with all mp3 players,This stuff claims to work with all mp3 players but it doesn't. Recently I bought it for my Samsung mp3 player and found that it takes only 2.5 mm audio jack. The J buds are 3.5mm and hence didn't fit. Promptly returned the stuff and got refund from amazon.
1,"Silicon ear inserts are flimsy, don't reduce size as well as skull candy, but skull candy wasn't reliable... will somebody","please make a perfect pair of buds? Thank you.This one is better than skull candy for working out-the noise from the wire moving isn't as bad.Sound is pretty good, but like I said-noise reducing ability is pretty sub-par.Update, 3 months after purchase, I have to buy a replacement for these as they came apart between the part that holds the silicone and the part that accepts the wire. Would not purchase these again."
3,Two pair in two years,"I found the sound quality on these earbuds pretty good for the Amazon price tag and have enjoyed them greatly....while they functioned. I've gone through two pair of these in two years! The first pair lasted about a year and then the right bud went out. I figured I'd had them a while and wasn't exactly gentle, so it could easily have been my care of them that killed them. And they worked really well and were inexpensive so I bought another pair...only to have the exact same thing happen about 9 months later. My best diagnosis is that the wiring is disconnecting from the jack inside the casing.I'm not sure if I'm just that hard on my headphones or if it's shotty product quality, but it's gotten annoying. And I think I'm going to buy a pair of Sony earbuds; slightly more expensive, but I know they're pretty durable."
1,The set I got weren't good,"I kept losing the covers off my old earbuds. So I ordered a couple new pairs; not knowing which ones would sound good. These were awful! They were much worse than my old ones, as well as the other Skullcandy buds that I bought at the same time. The JBuds were muffled and dull in sound. Maybe I got a bum set, but I threw them out."
4,good,I bought them to block out noisy people while I'm trying to work and they work pretty good for that.
5,So Comfortable,Finally found headphones that fit my ears. So comfortable and great sound quality for such a low price. Having three sizes you are sure to get a good fit.
4,Pretty good,The port/jack is pretty flexible which suit me very well when i put my mp3 player in the pocket.
3,Nice for the Price,"I bought some ear buds a year ago but forgot the brand, and lost them. These Jbuds look familiar so I thought these must be what I had, and bought them again. Whether same or not, this set of jbuds is not quite as good of quality sound as I remember my last set being so it may be that I had a different brand. Either way, these are WAY more comfortable than typical ear headphones that come with mp3 players! And they allow you to hear better sound since it puts the music into the ear canal with a soft rubber buffer. Quality sound is fine for me. Comes with 3 sizes; I think I may need to use smallest for best comfort/still using medium size. Worth the cheap price! I gave 2 sets as gifts for Christmas, too."
3,Good thing I have a 2nd pair?,"I'm having the same issues as the people who gave one to two stars for these earbuds. The left side just stopped working.I have to wiggle/position the wire in a certain position to have sound come out of both buds (this method is starting to fail now lol). My earbuds are still under warranty (1-month left)--and no I didn't use them consistently for 11-months. I did not get a response from Jlabs, after submitting the warranty form 3 days ago on the Jlabs page. My warranty will probably run out before they respond. 3 stars for good sounding earbuds at this price, but crappy response time and durability. I do have a 2nd pair, but i haven't opened the box yet..haha. Hopefully ,this will last longer, or I'm done with this company."
4,Fine for the price,I got it fast and the headphones work as I was expecting.I am over all satisfied with this purchase.
2,Defective,"I had to return my pair of ear buds because one was significantly louder than the other. I assume that this is not the status quo for all the ear buds JBuds produces, but I won't be buying a replacement set from them."
4,Good for athletics,"I got these when I started running and the earbuds that came with my MP3 player were driving me insane. I wanted something that would actually stay in my ears. These do the trick! I had a hard time at first figuring out how to situate them in my ear so they didn't get sweaty and fall out, but once you do that, no problems. They stay put and drown out other gym noise while I'm on the treadmill. I'd definitely recommend them if you want some good, basic earbuds that stay put while working out."
4,I'm happy with these earbuds,These have been a nice replacement to my apple in-ear earbuds that finally gave out about two months ago.
2,The most uncomfortable earphones I have ever had!,"These have nice sound, but I tried all three sizes of the rubber inserts, and not only did they never stay in my ears, but my ears ended up sore after a while. I will never buy this type again. If you have smaller ears, these may not fit you well, as they were horrible for me."
1,Garbage,These headphones are garbage. I was looking for an upgrade over the all-too common apple ipod headphones and decided on these after a friend recommended them. I was extremely disappointed with the sound quality that comes out of these. I never use them for listening to music.
1,defective,the earbuds worked for about a month. The right side stopped working. I was still using them for a while but I had to buy a new pair.
2,"Great sound, buds won't stay in","The sounds quality is great on these inexpensive ear buds, but I have tried all three sizes of the ends and I they just don't stay in very well. These were going to be my workout headphones, but they became my work headphones."
3,Good While They Lasted,"These earbuds will isolate about 30% - 50% more noise than over-the-ear earbuds or other types that do not create a seal in your ear canal. I like falling asleep to music, but I didn't want to disturb my roommate, so I went to sleep with them on a lot. Like most earbuds, these are not meant to be slept in, especially if you toss and turn a lot during sleep. Four months later, the left earbud went completely dead. I guess this product didn't pass my physical abuse test, but it did help me fall asleep while it still worked."
3,Decent headphones for the money,"I am not really blown away by these headphones, but I am not disappointed either. For the money they are a nice replacement for the stock iPhone headphones, but they don't do an effective job at minimizing outside noise."
3,"fits well, poor sound quality","This Earbuds fit well in my ear but the sound quality is poor. If you are not expecting good bass and rich sound then this is good for the money. I bought this to use instead of my Pioneer headphone sometimes for the convenience. I was hoping sound quality would be a little better but. 3 pairs of different size rubber fits are plus. Anyway, it is OK product for the money."
4,I am impressed,I really like a good sound when I listen to music.I was blown away by the clarity of the JBuds...and how comfortable they were. The best part was the price. They are well worth the money.
1,Dead after 2 months,"I bought these to replace a pair of Creative EP-630s. These were slightly more comfortable, but did not provide as good sound isolation or sound quality as the Creatives did. However, that was not the worst part. I received the shipment on Nov. 7, and they were dead by Dec. 24. The wire tore just above the plug, apparently because I had wrapped them around my mp3 player. I only paid $16, but these headphones are not worth that let alone the nearly $50 amazon is asking now."
3,died on me after one month,"I bought these because consumer reports rated them very highly. I did like the sound quality, and they have good passive noise reduction, but 30 days after I bought them, while I had them plugged into my laptop, the left side just died. I haven't been able to get it to work."
3,Good value,"I bought these for use on an airplane to reduce interference from ambient noise. Passive noise reduction from the air-tight seal of the earbuds makes them reasonably effective for reducing background noise, but they lack the capability of true active, electronic noise reduction. A cost benefit analysis, however, makes this a very savvy purchase for someone not willing to pay the big ticket for higher performing products. They work very well for my purposes."
1,No better than $1 earbuds,I didn't expect sound perfection but thought I would get a set of earbuds that we're durable - wrong! Sound is okay but the sound connection keeps going in and out. I will not buy another pair of these crappy buds.
3,Respectable,I actually prefer the ear buds that came with my mp3 player better. I'm not sure what the problem is but they just ain't right!
1,Wrong Price,"JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)The price listed is not correct. The vendor does not seem to be interested in correcting it, though."
1,Junk,I listened to these for 15 seconds through my Nano and threw them in the trash--literally! Don't waste your money.
4,Ear buds,The ear buds work well and are comfortable in the ear. The chord is long which could be a plus for some. I find it too long.
1,Not Great,Poor isolation. They don't feel like in ear head phones and I've tried the Sony and Creative ones.The sound was also weak and not as crisp as the others. It sounded kind of hollow.
1,These ear buds do not block out sound,"I'm really disappointed that I bought these. The silicone adapters that fit into the ear are too flimsy to block out any sound at all. I got these to replace a pair of broken Shure e2c earbuds that did a fantastic job of blocking out sound. Even though they hardly work, I've continued to use the Shure earbuds rather than these JBuds. If you're looking for something with good noise isolating properties, steer clear of these."
3,broken after 5 months,These were a great value while they were still working. The sound died in my right ear after about 5 months. It's too bad but I only paid ~$15 so I'm not too angry about it.
5,"Wonderful, versatile, and long lasting high quality ear buds","I'll be honest, these things should have died on me a long, long time ago. I purchased these almost a year and a half ago, and use them, without exaggeration, daily. I wear them running with my shuffle, in the library plugged into my laptop, on the treadmill with the neat built-in TV, on the bus with my iPhone. And in between, the cord is wrapped around all of these things or just stuffed into pockets - I am admittedly quite careless with my things and don't take very good care of things that don't cost more than a certain threshold.But these babies have made it through it all, and while the earbuds have started cracking a bit from wear and tear, I really don't notice an appreciable decrease in quality or noise reduction. The bass is great, the sound quality good, and I really can't recommend these enough."
2,Performed well for about 3 months,"These earbuds performed quite well for me at first- they fit well, had good sound and did an ok job of reducing ambient noise. I felt they were well worth the money. However, after about 3 months of use the right earbud went out and won't play sound anymore. I don't really use them for working out, just when I am doing mindless work around the house and such so I was disappointed that they failed fairly quickly."
2,They stop working in 6 months,"HiI ususally don't review items on Amazon, but thought I would since I am always buying these headphones. They are GREAT headphones the sound is great and I like the black color but after 6 months the right headphone always loses sound I guess the wires get tangled from when I wrap it around my ipod. I am very shocked with the high reviews maybe this just happens to me. This is my second pair that has broke on me I purchased the extended warrenty from Amazon I figure it's worth it since most headphone are only good for about a year. I am currently contacting the manafacturer Jlab to get a replacement hopefully they wont give me a hassle."
1,Right earbud failed,"Good sound, but despite being really careful with the cord, the right earbud died prematurely. oh well."
2,Worked Fine... But Broke After 6 Months,"I had no complaints about the quality of these in the first 6 months I had them. I'm no audiophile, but the sound seemed fine to me. However, after 6 months, 1 of the buds stopped working completely. I do use them every day and they get jostled around in my bag during the day; however, I think they should have lasted longer."
2,one small problem,"these ear buds are very comfortable. the different sizes for the tips are a great feature. the wires are slick instead of the iPod's slightly grippy wires, which means they untangle easier. but there's one problem: the sound sucks. i personally find them unsatisfactory in terms of audio fidelity. i went back to my iPod ear buds for much better sound, even though they are comparatively uncomfortable and don't block sound."
1,Terrible Headphones,"I am a typical music listener. I listen to music about 20-30 minutes a day on my 1st Generation iPod touch. After about a week of good use, my right earbud just stopped working. I plugged in my friends earbuds to make sure it wasn't the iPod and they worked perfectly. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! IT LASTS ABOUT 1 WEEK!!!"
3,Decent but not great,"This is an OK set of headphones. Noise reduction works well, sound is mediocre with almost no bass. Not horrible for a cheap set of headphones."
1,ear buds,"product was broke when we got it in the mail :( it was for my 11 yr olds i phone,not worth the trouble to send back. He was just happy to get a package in the mail. would have been more successful to just go to walmart, it did arrive right on time thow"
1,Defective.,"The product I recieved was defective. Maybe I just got a bad set of headphones, but these didn't work. When I plugged them in to my laptop/iPod no sound came out..."
2,Good but not long-lived,"I bought a pair of these and then bought two more when I liked them and they were on sale. Very good sound, comfortable in the ear -- but they are not durable at all. Granted, maybe they're not meant to be wrapped around an iPod and knocked around, but I would've expected them to be. Each pair only lasted about 6 months of daily use, and then the cord must've become separated in the plug part, and that was the end of them."
2,I loved the earphones till 2 sets broke in about six months,"I have small ears so I love it that they are small, most earphones are very uncomfortable for me. I was totally in love with them until they broke and I bought another pair and they broke to! All in six months! I had each pair about three months before they short circuted, they just died on me!"
2,"It is OK,","I am happy with the noise suppression, but it started crumbling on me, - rubber sleeve at the connector gave away and it hangs on two wires."
4,"good, but make sure to sign up for a warranty!","These earbuds worked well for about half a year when one ear stopped working. I got a replacement in the mail since I signed up for the warranty which lasts for 1 year. That pair also had one ear that stopped working after several months. Anyway, just make sure you sign up for the warranty if you purchase a pair."
1,Broke after 1 month!,"After babying these headphones more than I have ever done in the past, it was less than a month before the right ear went silent. I tested other earbuds on my ipod and workout machines, and it is the JBuds that are malfunctioning...I would not purchase this brand again."
1,not worth the money,"I decided to try these because as much as i love the sound quality and price of skull candy headphones they only last me a few months... terrible mistake. Not only is the bass rattly and tinny, the sound quality overall is awful. They are not really comfortable in the ear, but not terrible. They do NOT produce any noise reduction, which my skullcandy ones block out wonderfully. I know they do not claim to do this, but when sticking something in my ear, i would expect at least SOME noise cancellation. They also drained my ipod battery AT LEAST 3x faster than any other earphones i use, which i guess means they are not energy efficient. Anyways, i would never buy these again. Very disappointed."
1,Broke within a week,"within a week of buying, only one headphone worked. within a week after that, the other headphone didn't work (unless I twisted the cord in just the right way).The same exact thing happened to my other headphone made by JLab. Never buy JLab."
2,Watch out for the connector,"I bought these for my ipod mini. The sound and comfort is great but I have an issue with the connector. Ipods are designed to pause when you pull the headphones out and sometimes my ipod will pause suddenly even though these Jbuds are plugged in. I think it's an issue of compatibility of the mini jack with the input on the ipod. They are just fine if you plan to use them at your desk but if you want to walk/jogg with them, I would not recommend them."
2,Great for the first couple months,"I've owned 3 pairs of these ear buds, and they all ended up with the same problem. They're great for the first couple months, great sound, cute, comfortable, cheaper than the Sony ones. Then after a few months of usage one of the sides goes off. At first I could fix it by pressing the buds, which makes me think that it's the wiring that's malfunctioning, and eventually one side just dies. When it happened the first time I thought it could've been a problem with that specific one, and bought 2 more (white for me, black for my husband), but the same thing happened, so beware, this is not a long lasting product."
4,"Comfortable, Good Sound and NO Cord Noise!","I'm happy with them. They are for an Ipod shuffle. They fit well andare comfortable. Sound is good but I don't think it can handle a lotof bass. The cord is very long and needed to twist tie it up, but themain reason I bought these was that no one in any reviews I readcomplained about cord noise like other more expensive ones...andthat's true, no cord noise!"
5,Good sound - good comfort,"The earbuds that came with the Ipod are extremely uncomfortable. These were inexpensive and, although I have to turn the volume up a little, their sound is very good."
1,I will not reccomend them or buy this brand ever again!!!,I had bought these earphones with pepsi points and amazon.com.... thinking this is going to be a good pair like any other regular pair of earphones you get in the stores. But boy I was wrong... they don't stay in your ears and I listend to my mp3 and I couldn't hear myself speak to my sister.
1,late delivery,I would like to review the product but I can't because I still not have received it. I ordered this item on april 15th. Today is april 27th. How much longer do I have to wait for this?!
3,"Cheap, Comfortable, but not great sound.","I like the price and the comfort of these ""ear buds."" They are definately overrated though. I did not notice the sound being any better than the earphones that come with the iPod. If the sound was all it was hyped up to be than I would give them a 5. Keep on looking if you want better sound quality."
2,Nintendo DS headphones?,"These earbud headphones are the same(?), but lack features the Nintendo version has. They are the same earbud, but appear to be sold under a different brand:- The Nintendo version has chrome trim, whereas the JBuds are entirely white. Not essential, but visually superior.- The Nintendo version has a volume control, the JBuds does not.The Nintendo brand costs $5 dollars less, and has more features. Why buy JBuds?"
2,Muddy and ill-fitting,"These are really bad. The high-end frequencies are muddy and/or non-existant and the bass is terrible.Even with the smallest size plugs, these still don't seem to fit in my ear nicely.I wouldn't recommend these to somebody I hated, let alone a friend."
5,Good price - sound,"This is the second pair I purchased, the first lasts one year with dayly use. It fits ok in the ear with three different cubs."
3,"Functionally Great, broke easily","These headphones are both of satisfactory audio quality and way more comfortable than the earbuds that came with my first gen iPod Nano... and very reasonably priced. Unfortunately, that last bit may be because of the disappointing construction quality. The wire connection to the right earbud became unreliable after only a couple months, and the left one soon followed a month later. I'd recommend them only if they rev the product to fix the wiring at the jack connection."
3,It's Okay,"Prior to this one, I'd been using a $7 earbud. Prior to that, I was using the given Apple ipod earbuds (which I didn't like b/c it didn't fit well). I haven't seen a major difference with the JBuds, other than the boost in the bass; however, it seems to come at the expense of the higher freq. sounds, which isn't good for the type of music I listen to. Since I didn't pay that much for the JBuds, I really don't mind; however, it seems that the difference in earbuds on the lower end (<$50) don't seem worth paying more if you can avoid it. That said, I've tried the expensive ones at stores and they don't seem to make a great difference either!"
4,"Comfortable, good sound for small price","Like the title says, these earbuds are quite comfortable, they stay in place well, even when jogging, and they sound good. Not great, but good. The ""noise-reducing"" claims are exagerated (no, they won't block out a crying baby on an airplane). All-in-all, a good value for your money."
4,Pretty decent sound for the price.,"The sound of these headphones is actually pretty good, contrary to some reviews I have read. These headphones only cost be $20.00 with shipping, and they are nice and small, discrete if you will. I could sit in class and listen to my music without a teacher hassling me. They come with 3 different size jells to fit any ear size. The bass is good, and I do think there is enough treble. In a song where there is a lot of bass, it seems to get a little overwhelming. But all in all, I think this is a good, well put together product. I just hope they can last me long enough. I would recommend these ear buds, or the skullcandy ear buds. But if you want something smaller around the same price I would go with these. 4 Stars"
2,Quality and performance are TERRIBLE!,"These are the worst headphones I have ever bought! If I try walking with these headphones in, they shift to only working in one ear. This problem also happens if I tilt the headphones just by moving my head! This is ridiculous! I wouldn't pay more than 3-4 dollars for these headphones. The noise canceling aspect was barely adequate."
2,Poor quality - won't stay in ear,"Received from Amazon quickly - excellent 2-day shipping. Not sure if I have big ear canals, but these ear buds would not stay in while doing just moderate exercise. In addition, the sound quality was not as good as the earbuds that came with my ipod."
2,"Comfortable, sound good, but don't last","These earbuds are comfortable, sound good and do a reasonable job of reducing outside noise. However they won't last more than a few weeks. This is the second set I've had that has shorted out. The problem is the strain relief. It is too short and not rigid enough. After a few weeks of being careful not to torque the connector, this second pair shorted out the same way the first did. I don't abuse them. Mostly, I just put my iPod in my shirt pocket while I'm walking my dog."
3,good enough,"The sound is better than the standard buds that ship with ipods, but I can imagine that others may be better. They stay in place better than the regular buds, but I still have to mess around with them a few too many times when I go for a run.For the money, these are pretty good. If you're willing to spend more, I'd search around for something else."
2,product is okay,this product is ok.i dont like the fact that the ear plugs keep coming out of my ears. it's hard to run on the treadmill while they're coming off. the shipping was a hassal. it tooked about a month to get it. it was so hard to contact the shipper especially without an response back for weeks =( it's too bad because i dont usually give out bad reviews. such a big disappointment
1,Keep looking,"I bought these as an upgrade over the ear buds that came with my mp3 player. I wish I would have saved my money. The only difference is that my old ones are better. There is no high range at all. The music sounds muddy or muffled. They are comfortable, maybe I'll use them to mow the yard. Very disappointed."
5,WOW!!!,"I just got my jBuds this morning and WOW!! That's all I can say. The noise reduction is amazing! The cord length is GREAT! The sound quality is tip notch!These things are so clear that I can hear the snare drums in a lot of songs that I sometimes can't not hear when I listen to the same song on my computer. The bass these things put out is CRAZY GOOD.The only beef I have about these, is the cord durability. I've used other ear buds that have a ""gummy"" feel that doesn't tangle and is a bit softer to move aroundBut I'll tell you what, JLab has a customer for life! In fact I'm thinking of giving these to my wife and buying the j2's."
3,A little misleading about iPhone support (2G),"My 2G iPhone has slowly turned into my primary mp3 player as I walk to and fro classes. I wanted a pair of rubber earbuds after my sony ones started crackling. At $10 I thought, 'what have i got to lose?'Pros: comfortable to wear for extended periods (I wear them about 4-5 hours a day and sometimes to sleep), the sound is decent (the bass is a tad on the weak side)Cons: It doesn't fit as well as my other ""higher tier"" ear buds. This for me means less sound insulation for both ends (people would never notice that I was blasting music with my sony's)my *major* gripe with this product is that it's advertised to work with iPhones. This is true *if* you have a 3.5mm adaptor for the 2G iphone. bummer.At this price, I'd say this is an excellent deal for a casual pair of ear buds"
4,Decent Product but Good Customer Support,"I bought this ear bud in August 2009. It works decent, good for the price. Last week, however, the right ear bud stopped working and I emailed JLab Audio for a replacement since it is under warranty. All they wanted was my amazon.com order number and shipping address. I got the replacement at the end of the week, which is also under a full 1-year warranty!"
4,Great Sound & Comfort on a too long string,"I like the ear buds that come with the ipod, except, after a short period of time they one of them no longer works. The JBuds are more comfortable than the ipod buds. The sound is significantly better. But the cord arrangement could use some improvement. I like to be able to wear the cord like a necklace in case a bud slips out, it won't fall to the ground. These don't give me that option and the cord is about 6-8 inches longer than I like it. Overall, though, sound is the most important feature to me and ear comfort next, and these are a great value."
5,Ear Phones,These ear buds are great with my ipod.They really help reduce the outside noise.I'm VERY HAPPY with the product aswell as the quick shipping.
3,the price is the best part,"These buds have a characteristic common to many headphones: overemphasis of the mid-range (for whatever popular reason), so these buds are not ""high fidelity"".Other than that, they're decent."
1,THEY SUCK!,"They don't cancel out any noise at all. I'm just glad that this was bought with a gift card and not my own money. I would not recommend this to anyone. Go to Walmart and buy the marshmallow ear buds for $14.88, I've bought these and completely satisfied with them, its like wearing ear plugs that play music"
2,Died within 2 months of light use,"Very limited range. Little to no bass and treble. Only used four hours a week for seven weeks lightly. Only used while sitting, not during exercise or walking. If you listen to audio books, this is not the pair for you."
3,Arrived broken....,"Opened up the package, plugged them into my SanDisk Sansa and only heard sound out of one ear bud. What I did hear sounded good and maybe that one bud gets 5 stars but the other bud gets 1 star, so I guess it averages out to 3 stars. I guess for this price you cant expect great quality control. Overall I do like how they look and fit and one bud did sound pretty good."
4,light and comfortable...,very light and comfortable... at last I found an ear buds that are not falling while running.
5,Awesome!,This is my second pair of JBuds. The only reason I have a second pair is because I freaked out when I misplaced my first pair. I have since found my first pair and couldn't be happier. These buds are just awesome.
3,"Good, but not good enough","Have to agree with the previous review. Great quality sound, but mine got messed up after about a couple of months: I'd say something to do with a wiring. I thought it was a random problem and wanted to buy another pair, but it looks like it is a pattern with this product. As nice as they were in the very beginning, I would think twice before buying."
3,sort of ok,"They work well with the music, but do not block the external sounds as well as I had hoped. But they were only $7. I am scared to buy the $23 ones and can't afford the $300 Bose headphones, that probably work very well."
3,Good value but you get what you pay for!,"It was a good deal and worth what I paid for them but not the greatest sound quality. They included 3 sizes of the actual earbud covers so that helped with finding the right fit but they still fall out at times during a work out. If you are just walking around they are fine.The current model costs 5x as much. Since earbuds are often lost or misplaced, you really can't go wrong."
2,bit uncomfortable :/,I know theyre cheap headphones but I've bought cheaper ones which work better. They dont fit too comfortable in my ears actually...
3,Failed after nine months,"I'd like to start out by saying these failed on me after nine months of moderate use. I've had ear buds fail on me in the past and usually its a slow death. With these on the other hand the right ear bud died without warning.The time they did last during the nine months was solid though. The sound quality is average, but for the price its expected.Even though I gave this three stars I ordered a second pair recently. You can be the judge if nine months is possibly worth ten dollars."
3,the sound is OK,"but the cord seems not quite sturdy, the part at the end of the buds has been broken. so I can see the metal inside. looks not quite decent. but the sound is OK. just OK."
2,not great..,"They were good for a while, but after a week only one side worked, which is annoying. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Broke in under three weeks.,"The sound wasn't bad considering the price point, but one of the ear buds went out not even three weeks after purchase.edit: Ended up getting another pair since they're so cheap in the hopes that they would be better. Again, good quality sound, and the second pair lasted much longer, but only just over three months of regular use."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I bought these to replace my Sony Fonitopia earphones. These have the worst sound quality I have heard. The sound is muffled and and don't produce very good treble or bass, only midrange. The volume level of these earbuds are also low. I would not recommend buying these if you are looking for good sound quality."
5,Good quality of earbuds with very reasonable price! Worth to get one,"I ordered the earbuds (pink colour) and its case on 15 Aug 2007 and received the pack on 27 Aug 2007 in very good condition. The delivery is very efficient!Also, i used my earbuds to listen Jazz music with my iPod nano. The quality is quite good too. The noise cancellation function works very well and I can adjust music volume to lower level than using the original Apple iPod headphone. It is very comfortable to fit my ear holes too, even wearing in long time (like 3 hrs). In the pack, it included other 2 sets of plastic buds to match different size of ears.The pink colour is quite fashionable and match my iPod case (purple and pink).According to the $20 price and having such quality, good deal! Worth to get one!"
1,What are you talking about? - this is junk!,"Something went wrong with my ipod's original earphone and I decided to replace it with this earphone because from the reviews it seemed that it has a resonable quality for this price.But it turned out to be the worst earphone I have ever had.The sound quality is pretty poor. The bass level is too high and the highs are not rendered at all.The stupid design causes it to fall out of ears every two step you walk. It is a fundamental design flaw with the soft silicone earbuds. It says ""the soft silicone earbuds fit perfectly inside your ears."" Yes they do but then they slide out in by the slightest movement because they have no grip.Just don't buy it. The original earbuds for the ipod are 100 times better than this junk in any aspect."
2,Broke after a few months,"I wouldn't say i was rough with the headphones. Everyday i would unwrap the wires from around my ipod, place the ipod in my back pocket, and go to work (never sat on it). The connection by the plug seemed be be the problem as fiddling with that part would tend to drop and bring back stereo sound (it's a straight plug). now i'm using the Sennheiser CX200 and they seem much better quality, with angled plug, still for a reasonable price."
4,"What? Huh? Who, what now?","Good Stuff, look for big discounts on'em.Paid 10 bucks a pair, well worth it!"
4,Nice little ear buds,"They really work great. I use them in the pc's at the office listening to music and sometimes at home in different electronic devices. It would really be great if the case was somehow included with the earbuds, you know one price for the both. I wish the cord was a bit longer too."
2,Wiring issues,"My product shipment arrived on time. It worked well for 4 weeks and now its giving me problem with the wiring near the adapter/connector, because of which it doesn't give any sound on one speaker. I have to keep adjusting at the point where there is a loose wiring/connection in order to hear something. I guess I can safely say that the durability is not good at all."
5,Great Customer Service,After 11 months one of the earbuds stopped working but under the 1 year warranty Jlabs will send you a replacement pair for free. I notified Jlabs' customer service that my earbuds stopped working and within a week I received the replacement pair for free! They have great customer service!
4,Should you buy the Jbuds or the Cobys,"I bought 2 pairs of the JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds for $9.95 and 2 pairs of the Coby CVE92 ear buds for $5.43. After using both, one will notice a difference between the two. The sound quality of the JBud is significantly better than the Coby. They also include 3 pairs of silicone ear bud tips in small, medium, and large to assure the perfect fit. Spend the extra $ 5.00 and get the JBuds. You won't be disappointed."
3,okay for the price,"work well and at a good price, but not very comfortable and if you are bumping it around sound travels through the cord."
1,"Had two pairs, both broke.","I ordered these earbuds and received a defective pair. Amazon, of course, replaced them, but within 2 months, my replacement pair also stopped working. Don't buy these--just spend the extra money and get a pair that will last."
4,Good for the price,"I was looking for some earbuds to wear while running, that wouldn't fall out. These hit the jackpot. I have really small ears, and the three size choices allowed me to find one that fit, plus, they never fall out! The sound is pretty good, maybe better than the sound from the buds that came with my iPod. The only drawback is that when I'm running, something inside the bud itself tends to make a little ""jiggling"" noise. Overall I'm satisfied for the amount I spent."
2,Just didn't make the cut,"I ride a very noisy train everyday to work which lasts for one hour. I use a Zune HD toprovide music to block it. Initially I had Zune earbuds which sounded great but only lastsa few months with heavy daily use and weren't cheap. I then tried Skullcandy earbuds and theyfilled the bill. They had great volume range and very solid reliability. However, weren't greatat noise isolation w/o increased volume. So I tried the JBuds and ran into the following issues.(1) I could not find an earpad which fit comfortably in my ear. (2) The volume sounded subduedas compared to my skullcandy's (3) Zero noise isolation since I could never get a comfortable fit.So, my search continues."
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"I recently moved back home with my mother. Instead of it just being my mom and grandma, my mother's boyfriend lives here too. We'll call him Steve. Steve likes to talk as loud as he can, right outside my bedroom door. Steve also thinks everyone wants to listen to what he has to say twenty-four seven. Don't get me wrong, Steve treats my mother well and I understand why she likes him. However, I want to cut his vocal cords. So I was looking for headphones that could block him out but still give me the quality of my stereo speakers. These are fantastic! The sound quality is amazing. I turn the volume up to where it is comfortable and then I'll take the buds out and I can't even hear the music. Put them back in and it's like I'm listening to surround sound.Best part, they nicely block out Steve, his rants, and his raving. I might be able to resist the urge to kill him, if only I could figure out how to get him to stop talking to me altogether."
4,Good for chill time but not for working out,"These ear buds are more comfortable than some, which is what I was looking for - to use on a plane, etc.Had to use them during a workout when I forgot my other ear buds, and they were definitely not meant to be used during rigorous activity. They fall out of your ears fairly easily."
2,Not very durable,"The extra length of the JBuds ear buds cord is a plus and the noise canceling properties are effective.However, after almost a 18 months of usage, one of the buds went silent as apparently some of the smaller wires inside the casingleading to the jack became detached at the base of the plug...too sensitive."
3,Ok earbuds not small,"Didn't buy for sound quality. Was looking for earbud replacements for my kid's shuffle, to fit a child's ears. Even the smallest silicone cover didn't fit nor did the original ipod earbuds. Little frustrated with return policy it wasn't worth losing the 20% and more on shipping to just return them.Will continue my search."
4,"Good fit, good sound!","After trying several brands of earbuds (I swear they are all made by the same manufacturer) I found these to be the most comfortable/adjustable. The noise reducing quality is great since it blocks out most noise that interferes with music, but still allows you to hear when your name is called...ie. my kids & I both have these & I know when their volume is up too high vs. ""I just gotta hear this song"" (selective listening)."
1,burned twice,"I bought a pair of these earphones to use while running, and they worked well for about three months. Then the sound started cutting out in one ear and the sound was so unbearably distorted that they became unusable. As I liked the sound, and the price, I figured that I had just been unlucky and ordered a second pair in May. Now exactly the same thing has happened again. I'm speculating that the jolting motion of running is the cause. These may be good earphones, but I would not recommend them for anyone who's a runner."
2,"Great while they last, which wasn't long for me","A week ago one side went silent. Yesterday, the other bud went silent. They don't work anymore, so I had to dig up my original ipod issued headphones. I went to my account to see when I ordered these, and it was early March. So these ear buds were very comfortable for the five months that they worked. Do I spend another $20 and hope the next ones last as long or longer? Or get used to headphones I currently have? Unfortunately, $20 is a little more meaningful to me today then it was five months ago, so I'll pass on buying these again. I hope yours last longer."
1,right side no longer works!,"The right side quit after about 5 days! Now that's pathetic. I've tried the cheap ear buds from Koss as well and had problems with them as well (bought the same ear buds twice.) I would love to spend more money for a higher quality product buts its really hard to know which one! These are definitely not the answer, though."
5,Great deal for the money,"These headphones are great for the cost. I've tried ear buds that are better at noise cancelling, but these are pretty close: good enough, I say, if you don't want to spend 50 bucks."
4,It's not bad...,"I like it, but one problem is when I put it on it makes this crackling noise.One other reason I like it is because the sound quality is equivalent to the standard Apple earphones that come with your iPod iPhone etc... there really light don't really feel them in my ears. I use them for when i'm doing homework so I need something that is noise reducing and is comfortable,these are a good buy if u don't like the feel of the Apple earphones (like me)"
2,Where's the sound?,"I have had many sets of earbuds ranging from really cheap (the kind you get with most cheap electronics) and some much better. This didn't even measure to the cheap ones. The sound is so low that I had to turn up my device to full volume to hear it comfortably. Even then, it did NOT block out any noise. I immediately plugged in another set I had been using and the volume nearly blasted out my eardrums. Don't bother with these. There are much better ones out there."
2,Tinny,"I got better sound quality from a pair or earbuds that came with my Gilette razor blade refil a few years ago. These are tinny, no bass to speak of,and none of the rubber ear pieces fit my ears right. I'm quite disappointed. Maybe the best things in life are free. Back to the drawing board."
2,"Great Sound, terrible durability","Give these a 6 month lifespan at best. I've already burnt through two pairs and each time, after maybe 5 or 6 months, one of the buds suddenly starts cutting out, and then stops working altogether. I'm not rough on them, I sit at a desk in an office; I don't pull on them, don't tug on them, I store them in a hard case along with my mp3 player. There's no reason for these to break as soon as they do - unless you chalk it up to poor craftsmanship, poor quality materials, etc. If these were $3 a pair, sure, I'd just buy a new one. But at around $10 a pair, you might as well buy something you don't mind throwing away. And before you think my experience is atypical, just consider that I read all these reviews BEFORE buying these. I bought my first pair and 4 months later they were dead. Bought a second pair, 6 months later, they were dead. I'm going on right now to buy ANOTHER BRAND that hopefully won't break."
1,Refurbished?,"The ear buds came in an open plastic bag. Amazon should have put this in description.For this price, no one is going to ask for return, but product like this undermines Amazon's credibility."
4,Doesn't really reduce noise much...,"I have other earphones that reduce noise better and have the same sound quality and price range. They don't even say noise reducing either o.OThese are somewhat noise reducing, but I've used better ones. When you turn your music on, it's noise reducing alright. If you used them without music as in working out in the gym and you forgot your player you will be able to hear sounds. Sounds that are louder and you won't hear the squeaks on the floor and people walking around and such.The quality is great, their comfortable, but I wouldn't use them for reducing noise without music like some do."
1,Great sound while they last,"Fantastic sound out of these little things. But only while they last, which is unlikely to be more than a couple months."
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"The sound quality is abysmal. It's grainy and unclear, do yourself a favor and buy the Skullcandy Ink'd headphones for the same price. I have them, and the sound quality is at least twice as good. And they're more comfortable."
2,Don't worth its price,The sound quality is very common. Not worth its price. Not deep bass at all. I regret to buy it.
4,Nice and clear,"I use it mostly for listening to podcast in the gym. It works fine. However, when I use it before bed time to help me go to sleep, the volume is a little too high for sleep time mode."
4,Good for what they are,"I'm not crazy about ear buds in general, but they do a great job and stay put without hurting like a lot of ear buds do. Great sound quality."
2,"okay buds, I wouldn't buy them again","I've worn these type of ear buds before and was used to how the old ones fit in my ear. These keep falling out, even trying each of the three rubber discs that come w/the buds. What's more, apparently there seems to be a wiring issue because one of buds ""cuts out"" on a regular basis. I'll definitely go back to a Sony product next time. These weren't worth the money."
5,Jbuds,I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the ear buds are. They are great to use when running as they stay in place! The sound quality is excellent.
3,They wont stay in your ears,These are great value and quality for money unless you plan to use them while exercising. They constantly fall out of my ears when I am on the treadmill no matter how I position them.
3,It's ok,"It's ok. Nothing too fancy. For the price, it does do its job. If you want quality spend a little more money on a higher end headphones. Bought this just for work."
2,The sound is tinny,"They're comfortable enough, but the sound quality was a big disappointment. There's very little bass or depth. I'm no audiophile, but I know a thin and hissy sound from a rich, deep one. I bought these as a backup to the earbuds that came with my Sansa Clip a year ago. I was thinking they will eventually break, or wear out. I give them hard use, wearing them as I exercise. The Sansa earbuds have pretty good sound, and these were a huge step down. So, I'll keep them as emergency back-up earbuds--but they sound very thin and cheap. Not worth the money, IMO. I can get Wal-Mart earbuds at the counter for about 4 bucks that sound about the same."
4,Cheap and useful,They are a comfortable headset and provide a super sound. They also include three adapters for each type of ear canal.
2,Doesn't last long for joggers,"Sound is muffled and poor, but you will get used to it. Good fit in ear. Good noise canceling. I went jogging with these daily for about 2-3 and the right earbud went dead. I'm not sure if it is due to the running, but my experience does agree with previous reviews about running causing the headphones to die. Do not buy if you're a jogger."
3,noise reducing ear buds,"I bougt this item to be a good ear bud with some noise reducing ability, and that is what it does. Not the best sound quality, but then its not one of the more expensive ear buds. The sound is good, not great, but it does deliever on the noise reduction. It's a good buy for the money, if you want really good sound , this probably is not what your looking for."
4,Like,"For one, I like the color and it keeps the sound out. What I don't like is how far you have to put in ears."
4,Good product,My daughter loves the ear buds. She is really hard on this type of ear phones. So time will tell to see how long these will last. So it is hard to give a positive feedback till time goes by.
4,Liked,"The earbuds are good for the price. I don't have any complaints. Maybe I should have given product five stars, but there isn't anything extraordinary to say so I gave them four."
4,quite nice!,"Nice sound, fast delivery.nice, economical purchase. Well worth the money and quality was nice surprise! order with confidence---fell free to order"
2,Half DoA,"I got these to replace my iPod headphones, which were falling apart. Was excited to gave them, as I am currently deployed in Iraq and music is one of the few things I am able to take solace in. Upon plugging them in, I found the right earbud to be inoperational. The problem appears to be in the jack, which is not a 90 degree or straight, but an annoying 45 degree angle. When you jiggle it, the earbud cuts in and out. Wouldn't recommend this, spend a little more, get some quality earbuds."
3,sound disappoints,"I bought this because of the large number of positive reviews but the sound quality disappoints. The highs are crisp but there are too little base and middle range frequencies. Overall this makes the sound lack warmth and depth. My original iPod buds hit the mixture much better, even though they were not as crisp in the highs.Wearing the buds definitely takes getting used to as they need to be inserted fully into the ear canal. This is not as comfortable as regular buds, and it takes some tries to make them stay."
1,JBuds Hi-Fi Noise Reducing Ear Bud,"JBuds Hi-Fi Noise Reducing Ear Bud was purchased to replace Sony MP3 player ear bud that came with the MP3 purchase but broken one side after 8 months use. But JBuds Hi-Fi Noise Reducing Ear Bud was already broken,which means one ear bud is no longer function after about four weeks use:stopped using it and back to the one deaf Sony bud;JBuds Hi-Fi Noise Reducing Ear Bud: while being used for running, one of two buds kept on falling off; when out side temperature fell below 32F, the lines for the buds got too stiff ( may be frozen)to hold the buds in ears;"
3,"Great Sound, but ...","While I'm no expert on headphones, I've had plenty of them before... and every single pair eventually got to breaking. It's just the nature of headphones, I suppose. They never seem to last.This pair had a great sound quality to them (at least as far as my untrained ears could tell) and I used them all the time in both my computer and my hand held devices. After seeing the price, I was hoping that it wasn't just sound quality I was paying for, but also physical quality. I didn't want them breaking on me after a few months... but they did.I wouldn't say they're bad. I just wish there were a pair of phones out there that wouldn't break on me."
2,OK earbuds,inexpensive and will do the job but the sound is lo-fi not hi-fi. My Sony earbuds although slightly more expensive are noticeably better. Good pair to have as a backup.
4,Pretty cool,"At first I wasn't to happy with the Jbuds, but after reallly pushing them into my ears-- as I should of in the first place... They became very comfortable and the sound quality really improved..I bought these for my white Zune and for the price you can't go wrong....pretty cool...I would buy them again if had to do over..."
4,Great for Working out & Bowling,I bought these mainly to cancel out noises while I'm working out and use them also to zone out alot of noise at the bowling alley. I was skeptical at first but after having them for the past two weeks find that they are indeed a noise-reducing product and have good quality sound. I would recommend this for recreational music listening use.
1,Brake very fast,I have the ipod white headphones which so far have lasted me 4 years.These broke with in a month. First one ear stopped working then the other.
3,Same As Coby,"Well they arn't bad for the price, however coby offers the exact same earbuds and they're five bucks cheaper. The only differnce is that the JBls come with multiple size silicone things. So if you just use the standard medium size save your money and buy the coby ones. Also, just a general tip save your warranty stuff it's good for a year and I don't know about you but my headphones usualy die in under a year."
2,Broke after one month,"For less than $10, I expected it to affect the sound quality, but not the quality of the craftsmanship. The right ear bud stopped working after just a month. Seriously? After just one month? I'll spend more on my next pair."
1,Total Crap,The earphones are totally useless. They wouldn't stay in my ear and kept falling out. I sent them back right away.
3,Just a regular earphone,"1. The sound quality is good2. Actually, it can not reduce the noise at all. The only thing you can do is tuning the volume up to cover the noise, which is bad for your earIn short, forgetting the noise-reducing function, I think this earphone is still a nice earphone.3. After a few months, the wire seems broken inside. You have to put the wire in a specific position to make it work."
1,doesn't work properly,"when I get it, it is broken.left earphone does not work.I don't like it.how can i return it?"
2,"Ugh, they're OK for the money I guess","I use these with my Droid X and their OK. I guess I knew they weren't going to be Bose headphones, but the $10 headphones that I usually buy from Target sound WAY better than these."
3,Not entirely noise cancelling...,"If you are looking for noise cancelling earbuds, I would not recommend these. Read closely and notice they say, ""passive noise cancelling"". In other words it blocks out some extraneous noise if you are playing music on a medium to loud volume. In order to truely be noise cancelling they need to have electric circuitry. Other than not being noise canceling the comfort and sound quality of the buds are great. I will let you know how the company does with returns."
2,Tinny sound quality compared to stock Sansa buds,"Just bought a Sansa Clip+, and a few of the reviews for that product recommended picking up the very reasonable JBuds as an upgrade. Doing back-to-back tests of the Clip+'s stock buds against the JBuds, JBuds fell short by a mile in terms of sound quality. There's no bass, not even fiddling with the Sansa's EQ functions to bring out the bass. Sansa's buds are by no means mind-blowing, but they at least have some low end.I'm simply looking for a reasonably flat or neutral frequency curve, as much as an inexpensive set of headphones can provide. Not seeking out massive bass. I listen at low to moderate volume. The Sansas sound better, so the JBuds will be an emergency backup. I suppose the one thing to recommend them is their insanely low price."
1,these lasted six months.,"the absolute worst set of ear buds i have ever owned. they broke within six months. first the right side would go in and out, then it went dead. so for a month or so i listened to them out of the left side only... pretty retarded... then eventually the left side started fading... then dead. welcome to sucktown! these things suck. invest a little more money and get something of quality. avoid!"
2,Not durable at all (college student),"I bought this set in early march and starting a week ago...I lost sound in the right piece and I have to fiddle with the wire to get broken sound in the left. I am feeling rather disappointed with its durability. Of course, being a college student, sometimes I put the earphones in a pile of stuff in my book bag..but my previous headphone (SONY over the ear) lasted a lot longer time (until I lost it lol).But yeah, overall...gives pretty decent sound with excellent comfort..but didn't last me more than two months...."
1,good for few months then breaks,"This is the second pair of jbuds that I have purchased from amazon. The first pair were awesome for a few months, then suddenly the left earbud went dead. I thought it was just a fluke, and the sound quality is really good at this price, so I ordered a second pair. Same story. Worked beautifully for several months, then the left earbud went dead again. I will never buy this brand again."
5,"amazing, especially for the price","honestly the best headphones I've ever purchased. you can certainly spend more money and obtain a higher quality product if you desire to, but these headphones are absolutely perfect for listening to a portable music player on the bus, in the office, etc. great at noise canceling, excellent sound quality. much, much better than the classic earbuds. best purchase I've made in a long time."
1,Cheap sounding earphones,I bought these earphones because of the good reviews.But they're really bad! I got them as a replacement for my broken iPod earphones and I thought they would be some kind of upgrade.They are of a much lesser quality than the original iPod earphones.They sound unclear and noisy.Don't buy them.
2,"Very Disappointing, Given the STRANGELY High Reviews","Pros: the silicone ear pieces fit comfortably and snugly in your ears.Cons: I was extremely disappointed with these headphones given that the reviews are so high. In fact, the earbuds that came free with my cell phone have a far better quality sound, as are my standard ipod headphones, and frankly, many other earbuds that don't have nearly the high reviews these have. It all comes down to price; people like me have bought these thinking they'd get good quality for a low price, but in fact I'd have paid a little more to get better-sounding headphones. Beware of a $10 price tag!"
3,They were great for about a year...,"I loved these earphones and used them all the time. They have great sound reduction from outside noise and good sound quality, but I've had them now for almost a year and they broke on my yesterday. Sounds like one of the wires got torn, cause the right ear sometimes gets no sound. I need to buy a new set now... going to try something different this time."
2,lasted 2 months,"Sound is okay, acceptable for the podcasts to which I listen. I like that they have a clip that keeps the earbuds together - keeps tangling to a minimum.Having said that, not worth the price for how quickly the wiring came unsheathed. 2 months in and they need replacing because the wires are exposed near the jack, and the sound is now cutting out."
3,Basic replacement earbuds.,"Nothing fancy but very funtional replacement buds at a reasonable price. Attractive colors, comfortable design and good quality. I hope they last."
4,Cheap price but pretty good quality.,"Cheap price but pretty good quality, fits in the ear very nicely, and has the same quality sound as $50 earbuds."
2,"Good, except do not reduce noise!","I bought these because I wanted a way to block out outside noise while studying. However, these headphones fail to do that and leave me constantly needing to boost the volume to unsafe levels to drown out even casual nearby conversation. I feel like this will ultimately damage my hearing and therefore I have decided to return them (under Amazon's admittedly excellent return policy). Don't buy these if you want noise reduction. The sound quality is actually very good, but the noise reduction is non-existent."
2,Dissapointed in the performance of these,I bought a pair of Sony Fontopia with a 3.5 star rating and loved them. Then saw these Jbuds with an even better rating so naturally thought that they would be better. How dissapointing! The sound quality is very poor in comparison. Dont waste your money even if it has been discounted. Not sure what the other reviews were using as a benchmark when rating this item but I had a direct comparison with the equivalent Sony Fontopia.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased these, fortunately on sale, and was greatly disappointed. They are not actually noise reducing--technologically speaking. They have silicone ear covers that are supposed to seal out noise when fit in your ear properly. I was unable to fit them in my ears properly, despite the 3 different sized covers. Maybe it's just my ears, but I don't think so. I would not recommend these to anyone. Instead, spend a couple more dollars and get something that is not painful in your ears."
4,work well at the gym,I was having a problem with the original ear buds that came with my ipod. They kept falling out of my ears while I was on the treadmill. These have the 3 different size rubber inserts for a tight fit. I also find that they block out other noise very well!
3,Not as good as the Sony Fontopia,"I bought these headphones to replace my second pair of Sony Fontopia headphones that went bad. I thought I'd give them a try since they had a similar looking ear cushion.The good news. These earbuds fit exactly like the Sonys. Great for blocking out external noises when listening to spoken word like audiobooks or podcasts. Somewhat cheaper than the Sonys.The bad news. Sound quality far inferior to Sony, very muffled sounding.In the end, went ahead and bought another set of Sony Fontipias and threw these in a box."
4,great ear buds,"Again, Amazon hasn't failed.Reviews, comparisons, purchase, and shipment was easy to do, accurate, and speedy. Received the shipped promtply!"
2,Please Read!,"I bought this item and LOVED IT immediately. There were no problems and it was better than I expected, but after using it moderately for 3 months (on average 2 times a week), it went bad. I mean out of nowhere, for no apparent reason, it just went out in one ear. If I twirled the cord right I might get some sound. My recommendation is to not buy it. I'm sure you can find something better, or instead, you can find some headphones just like these that go out in 3 months for half the price."
3,Great while they lasted...,"After I first used these headphones I was quite happy with the sound quality and comfort level they provided for the price. Now about 4 months later the headphone plug-in part is dysfunctional. Unless you move it around only the left bud works, and I have tried them on many devices to test them (car, ipod, laptop, etc.)"
3,"Good sound, short life","This headphones work great, hard to clean of course, as the human ears are filthy unless constantly cleaned with q-tips of course, but the sound on these is incredible, much better than regular ipod headphone sound, also much better listening quality, blocks out other sound better. however after only 7 months, these things just cut out on me one day, I tried them on multiple devices, and they just keep cutting out unless they're held at a certain angle or pressure, etc. IE, not worth the trouble after that point."
4,Almost Great,"Besides the earbuds that are included with these earphones, I would love them. They look cool and perform pretty nicely too. Earbuds are exchangable so this is not a big problem and will differ from person to person, but with any earphone set like this, you need to get a good seal around your ears to get that full sound you want. Not the most base and not the most treble out there, but great all around set."
1,if you are active don't buy!!,"If you are an active person do not buy these !! I am by no means a runner, a racquet ball playing type of person, but with the little bit of activity I do do..these did not stay in my ears. I tried what they suggested in the ""pamphlet"" that came along with the phones (rig em over your ears), & that didn't work either. I also tried changing out the ear pieces..no go.I could send them back for $10, but I only paid $8 for them !!"
1,"Horrible Product, You Have MUCH Better Alternatives","I originally purchased these ear buds to replace my original iPod ear buds for use at the gym. The iPod ear buds kept falling out of my ears while running and sweating, and so I knew that an ""in the ear"" version was what I needed.The audio quality on these ear buds is horrific, much worse than the iPod ear buds. They are uncomfortable and feel very cheap, like they would break after a couple weeks of regular use. They sound very ""tinny"" and have ZERO bass response.After returning these, I ended up buying a pair of the SKULL CANDY INK'D ear buds from Amazon, which are awesome!! They are the same price, but are well built, comfortable, include multiple sizes of the silicone inserts, are noise cancelling, and have great bass response, which is nice when you are looking to get pumped up by your music at the gym. I recommend you check them out, and avoid this JBuds garbage at all costs!! Don't waste your time or money with this bogus product!"
5,Great improvement over the ipods provided earphones,These JBud Hi-Fi Ear buds are great for thier price. They reduce background noise very well being that they are in ear. The clarity and bass response are far better then the ipods provided earphones. They are far more comfortable as well. I would even concider giving these to a loved one.
3,They're OK.,I think they're not in a class by themselves -- just worth what they're priced at. But what should one expect?
5,Work great,These work great and the cord is long. Not super long but long. They are quality and a fraction of the price
3,mediocre fit,Comes with multiple size rubber ear inserts. None of them seem to fit real well or stay put for heavy exercise.
2,Cord breaks at plug end,"These headphones worked well for me for a few months of occasional use - comfortable, lightweight, decent sound performance. I thought I had done well in the hours of research that went into choosing this inexpensive model.However, yesterday the sound became crackly, and I realized they were broken. There is a weak point in the design: the place where the cable meets the audio plug can take a lot of abuse simply by being in your pocket. The cable is very fragile, and with all the twisting and bending it eventually [rather quickly] wears out and breaks. They're now unusable.The headphones would be wonderful if they were engineered with a right-angle 3.5mm plug, so the cable itself wouldn't be absorbing all the shock against the plug.For most users, I'd avoid this model. Advice: always buy headphones with a right-angle plug. See here for example (though I've never used these):[...]"
5,Love them!,"I listen to music almost every waking minute of every day. I love these earbuds for their quality and low price, and I especially love JBud's exemplary customer service, even though I've only needed it once. Highly recommended!"
2,Pretty Crappy,"I had been using the v-moda Bass Freq earphones for a while, then switched to some Sennheiser earbuds. Both were pretty decent, but i have to say the v-modas had a better punch for rock/rap which i listen to. I tend to break earphones a lot getting them snagged on things in the gym, so after my last incident i decided to try these. I guess the sound is clear enough, the mid to high range is pretty decent, but there is NO bass whatsoever. None. If you like bass, steer clear of these.Seriously for a few bucks more you can get the v-modas and you will be much happier."
4,JBuds Ear Buds,"JBuds are really comfortable earphones, what makes them especially popular is that they have great sound, and they fit neatly in your ear, for added comfort. I would recommend JBuds for listening to music on a ipod, or any type of MP3 player makes JBuds a easy choice when selecting a good quality ear bud phones. I have had no problems since I purchasedJBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)a pair, and they don't fall out like some other types I have had in the past."
2,Not Good for Working Out,"If you lift weights, find a different set of ear buds. These repeatedly came out of my ears during today's training session."
4,A bargain,"Wasn't expecting much because of the low price. All I wanted was an improvement over the sound of the apple buds that came with my iPhone. These are a drastic improvement. I could have paid $100-$200 for some really fantastic sounding earbuds, but I'd almost certainly lose them. These are so inexpensive I bought one set for work and one set for my gym bag."
2,Failed after 6 months,"I liked these while they worked, the sounded fine and worked much better on flights than the regular ipod headphones, with one caveat - the flanges tended to fall off when packed away in a pocket, a bag, or underneath my pillow (I am one of those people who listen to podcasts at night before falling asleep...) I lost one early on, and the other sizes (it comes with three) never quite fit.But the right ear piece stopped working yesterday and I am going to order a different pair from another manufacturer. Even at this price I can't recommend a product that fails that quickly."
5,AWESOME!,I absolutely love this product. They have superior fit and excellent sound quaility. The customer service is outstanding. I lost one covering and They sent me new covers at NO CHARGE! I highly reccomed this product!
3,Not spectacular by any means,"I purchased these to replace the ""V-Moda bass ear buds"" I lost recently. I guess I was seduced by the lower price tag. Ten bucks isn't a lot, but it adds up, so I went for the savings. It was a mistake. The sound just isn't up to snuff...it lacks bass and clarity. They were comfortable though, and my mom was complaining about her ear buds not staying in and being uncomfortable, so I gave these to her. Now I'm off to purchase the V-moda's I should have got in the first place."
2,Lasts about 4 months.,"I bought this item taking in to fact that the right bud will lose it's sound in around 4-6 months and when the 4th month arrived it went poop! I was listening with only the left side and everything felt lopsided. I immediately threw it away and wrote this review. If your a person who listen to music almost everyday with at least 2 to 3 hours a day, chances are your right side will go out in 4 months. It's cheap, sounds great, not so heavy on bass, which your ears won't bleed, and clarity is a bit foggy, overall good price, but not a worth investment for more than 4 months."
3,Broke 3 times in a year. Sounds good though!,"I liked the sound for the price, and they are very comfortable. They stay in place when I'm running or jogging. But they broke twice during the warranty period (I got new headphones twice), and then broke the third time two days after the warranty was up.They seem to be made for short-term use."
1,One side doesn't work,"Sound from one earbud is poor. Balance control on device I use it on is fine. Fine for listening to news, but not recommended for music."
2,Save your money,"Just bought these. I was impressed when I first used them, they had good sound and they were pretty comfortable. But within a couple of days, one of the buds died. It's a cheap set of headphones, and I really got what I paid for."
3,Sturdy little hook,This is hanging on the back of my closet door. It is sturdy and hold 5 days of my work clothing. This does not fit on all doors though. There has to be enough space between the door and the jam.
5,the snowstorm,I too read The Snowstorm as a kid and I've often thought of it . . . I'm the program director of an after school program and I'm going to order a copy to read to 'my kids'. i hope they'll like it too.
2,rebecca levine?!?!!?!?,what the eff does this woman know about essential hip hop??!!?!?what a comedy
2,good idea but...,"first of all, if you love these songs you definetely have all these albums. No need to go out and buy this.. All these dorks think they are down now cuz they hear old tracks they never heard before... If you are a rap fan you should have every single one of these albums from all the artists .. if not you shouldnt even buy it because you cannot reminice over it or appreciate it!!!"
3,Good soundtrack,"This soundtrack is very good, but if you like hip hop you should own every track on the artists Lp since these songs are basicly classics. How ever, the soundtrack is very good, but still is missing tracks like O.C - Times up, Onyx - Last Days and Showbiz and AG - Next Level....wich were one of the best from the movie .....why is that!"
5,Great Compilation,"When I first saw this CD, I thought Eminem made some more songs but when I got the CD, he didn't appear on the album once! Rather than putting on rappers on a soundtrack, this CD consists of all the music that was played throughout the movie of '8 Mile'. I love this CD, it has brought back all the old beats that the world once saw and this is full of great songs. I remember hearing these songs ages ago when I was a kid and it's good to hear them again and finally find out who sings the songs. My favorites are:Mobb Deep- Shook Ones, part 2Biggie- JuicyNaughty by Nature- Feel Me FlowMethod Man and Mary J. Blige- All I NeedPharcyde- RunninMobb Deep- Survival of the FittestI'm not saying all the rest of the songs are below average, their still good but I enjoy these songs the most (even though I hate Mobb Deep). The only weakness on here is probably Junior M.A.F.I.A- Get Money coz I hate Junior M.A.F.I.A. If you liked rap back in the ol' days, get this."
3,Not a Western Masterpiece but a good movie,"This is a character movie, not an action filled western. It is less about the cattle war and more about the people involved and how the events impacted the people. The movie is too long especially the first half. The editing and sound could be better and the movie expects you to fill in some of the blanks such as how the beginning Harvard graduation and dance connect with the ending boat chapter and what it all means. Overall it is a good movie. With better ediiting and an hour shorter it could have been great."
1,Slowest film ever made,"No amount of foul words can sum up my herculean hatred of this self-indulgent, lumbering, painfully slow movie. I have to sit hours because I wanted to write a really positive review of it after getting sick of the negative reviews but I can not bring myself to like it. It is a sadistic attack on the patience of the ordinary viewer. And I hate Jeff Bridges and his asinine looks.This should be dubbed, Hell's Gate.Stay away from this horrid movie."
3,The worst film ever made?,"No, not even close. Looong, yeah. Slow, of course. But how can a film with so much pointless violence, so many exploding peasants, ever be so ruthlessly dismissed by the youth of today? Truly, I cry for America.Seriously, though, if you're looking for an interesting failure, this pretty much fits the bill. The sound mix is still awful, the editing choppy but there are hints of brilliance here which makes you wish Cimino goes back for a director's cut one day. Christopher Walken puts in a good performance (along with a young Jeff Bridges and Mickey Rourke), and the score is truly haunting. I actually had to read Steven Bach's book (Final Cut) to figure out what was going on, but Heaven's Gate is worth a look if you don't build up your expectations too much (or lower them completely) beforehand."
1,WARNING: This is NOT about the cult from San Diego,"I rented this thinking it would be all about the cult that wore Nike's and went into outer space, but instead it was some boring western. I guess the cult never got their name copyrighted!!! Stay away from this!"
2,"A Very Well Done, Very Well Acted, Very Depressing Movie","My mother was surprised when she heard ""Heaven's Gate"" was nominated for a couple of Oscar awards, hearing about how big a bust it was. Having watched it, I could see why it was both worthy of Oscar nominations and a bust.The cast was great, including Kris Kristofferson, John Hurt, Sam Waterson, Christopher Walken, Isabelle Huppert, and Jeff Bridges. It dealt with a range war between the ranchers and the immigrant farmers. I don't know how accurate it is with history, but it showed a dark side where the rich ranchers were allowed by law to have people killed by bounty hunters without a warrant or trial. If this wasn't depressing enough, the final scene clinched it.People love Westerns, but this movie was too dark for a Western to redeem."
3,Pass me the Prozac!,"I was in the audience the night Heaven's Gate premiered here in Manhattan in l980. I can still remember how people began streaming out of the theater after more than 3 hours of gorgeous photography, knock-out costumes--but totally wretched performances and zero story line. There had been a year of hype and controversy. Everyone said it was a disaster not to be believed. After that first screening, we all believed it. The cast members--Kris Kristoferson, Isabel Hubbert, etc. were loathed. The movie reeked of ""Look at me! Look at this Great Scene!"" None of us could understand that never-ending sequence of people dancing wildly, maniacally around that goddamn tree (which the great artist, Michael Cimino, had uprooted and transported from somewhere at a cost of millions). I wanted terribly to at least like this movie on a technical level. I stayed until the bitter end and went straight home took two aspirin and dared anybody to call me in the morning."
2,"Unfortunately, not anamorphic","I've been on a western kick recently, buying and watching mostly classics of the genre from the 1950s. I finally decided to purchase Heaven's Gate, the controversial, budget-busting Michael Cimino film credited for nearly killing off the western. Unfortunately, this 2000 DVD release is not anamorphic, and it looks pathetic and puny on my large widescreen TV. It is widescreen, but since it's not anamorphic, you get black bars all around the frame. Occasionally there's also a bright blue line on either side of the frame, probably a kink in the original mastering process. It's all very annoying and distracting, and it has kept me from watching the entire 3-1/2 film. Whatever the merits of the film, it definitely deserves a new anamorphic release, or even better, Bluray."
4,Metric drill set,"Drill set was delivered promptly. It comes in a metal case that looks to be of the same quality as a standard drill case I have that is approximately 60 years old. As for the drill bits, only time will tell."
5,"good stuff, Maynard","This is really great tea. I bought six boxes and soon Ill have to order more, Im going through it pretty fast. Its delicious!!"
1,A little disturbing,"We all know the fairy tale of Snow White, mostly via Disney. So the dark themes of death including a dead mother, evil stepmother who orders her death, and Snow White being poisoned and dying has a make-believe cartoon edge. Bringing it all into a modern context reads differently. It seemed a little disturbing to me. I bought the book but had second thoughts about giving it to my 8 yr. old granddaughter."
3,"Great, while it still worked","This product was pretty cool at first. Not as good as Quicken on your PC, but it synced up well and was neat to be able to take with you to keep track of purchases. Would have been great for travel and for remember to log purchases. A few weeks after installing the software, I had to wipe my HP iPaq and reinstall it. It reinstalled, but now gives me an error message when I try to open the program. Everything else on the PDA works fine - I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and the same thing happens. I'm disappointed that it no longer functions. As long as it is compatible with your PDA and seems to stay functional, it's a neat product. Kind of pricey for what you get, but nice for the frequent traveler/personal finance guru!"
1,Kindle edition useless,"As a radiologist who works in 4 different locations, I have been trying to build a digital reference library that is portable and/or web accessible and easily searchable. I was disappointed that the Kindle edition is lacking in any linked table of contents or index. This makes the ebook essentially useless as a quick reference (the best use of a phone book like compilation of lists and bullets that this ""review"" manual really is). I wish they would put in the effort to update the kindle version and provide it free to anyone who has already purchased this brick."
3,informative,"I remember the laudatory Reader's Digest articles, the coincidental Kingston Trio song, and mention of Dr. Dooley by my high school English teacher. And, of course, I remember the disaster of Vietnam in the years following Dooley's death. ""Who was this guy Tom Dooley?"", I wondered. I know he didn't cause Vietnam, but he was emblematic of the drift that got us there. We had ""victory disease"" hubris from World War II, and Dr. Dooley was part of it. His vigorous self-promotion and the homosexuality revelations were surprising to me. It was the 1950's, of course, and his homosexuality was certainly kept under wraps when he was being hyped all over the place. I don't feel qualified to say this is a well written or poorly written book, but I at least know more about the influential Dr. Tom Dooley and, as follows, more about America."
4,Crawling king snake,"Very good stuff, but a long crawling blues to get there. Spans from easy litening blues to hard core. And that is good good good."
4,"Looks good, works well","This isn't the perfect briefcase but it really does everything I ask of it. I would like the interior compartments to have been a little more thought out though, they aren't that useful to me really. Beyond that I don't know what else I'd change, I think it's going to continue to work very well for me."
1,Not what i ordered,"I was highly HIGHLY upset when i ordered this item for my boyfriend for Christmas and when it arrived was COMPLETELY different then the picture. It had no handle, it did not roll and it was ugly."
1,Made in China,"I received these bowls tonight, washed them by hand and left them stacked without drying them. When I got around to wiping them, a little water had pooled in the bowls, but the water had left a dark wet mark that permeated under the glaze, through the bowl, and the water mark was present underneath and on the outside. Maybe I received a bad batch but I have never seen a glazed bowl do that before. Very strange. I was also disappointed in the quality. They appear as tho they will chip easy. Did I mention they are made in China? Aren't companies supposed to state when a product is imported?"
1,Bowls are defective,"We purchased 8 of these pasta bowls from Mikasa. We have the entire Italian Countryside dinnerware set and it has been a beautiful set, but the pasta bowls developed black marks randomly on the bowls. It appeared that something was leaching out. We are now down to 3 presentable bowls. I DO NOT RECOMMEND these pasta bowls."
3,Did you see his Lips????,"Honestly that's why I bought the cd. But much to my dimay I was ""looking for love in all the wrong places"".But ""just in case"" I was wrong I really, really tried to give it a chance but the lyrical quality just wasen't there for me. Hence the term (GHETTO)love. Now I will give credit where it due, there is about 6 good songs on the whole cd but that's waaayy after it grows on you.I would give him one more try on a second cd purchase. I really think with the right producer and music he could blow up.But if he comes with -""that baby ain't mine, he looks like Ginuwine"" I'll save my [money]. But that's just my thought."
3,Great Voice Cliche Material,Jaheim has that kind of Soul that has Been lacking.not since CHristopher Williams sung with the same Urgency has that kind of Teddy Pendergrass voice been felt.but like Chirstopher Williams Jaheim suffers from so-so Lyrics&Music.it doesn't fit His Vocal Pressence.Jaheim go tthe same Problem as Dave Hollister Great Vocal Talent but Hit&Miss Material that wear down the Vocal Power over time.no matter how Good you are Vocally Cliche Material will take it's toll.if given the right material Jaheim can last.
3,"...he gon' be alright, folk, give him time...","...he's the cream of the crop, as far as the over-cliche'd thugged-out-r&b-singer goes...much better at it than joe, chico and especially r. kelly only because jaheim seems to be more sincere with his than jus being gimmicky. stop comparing him to teddy tho...but if i had to compare him with anyone (vocally) i'd say luther vandross or brian mcknight maybe."
1,Bad Experience :(,"I had these wires on my car for less than 1,000 miles and they are already shot. The spark is jumping out of the boot on the coil pack side causing a major misfire at RPMs past 4k. I'll be sticking with MSD from this point forward."
3,"As described, but pretty thin paper... requires cardboard backing","These definitely are what they say they are... but they could stand to use heavier paper/target stock. These absolutely have to be stapled to cardboard or melonite backing boards for use, unless your range has full width top clamps and clamp-on bottom hangers (weighted to keep the traget stretched flat)."
5,Excellent,"As advertised. The print, material, and size is perfect. The product was shipped in a box with the targets rolled up. It does not produce a problem except after a few days the papers stayed ""curved"" from the rolling--a few staplers on the target board easily solved the issue. Simple recommendation is to lay the targets flat--apparently something everyone else does at the range. This IPSC target is excellent for practice at the range for IPSC events, CQB, or tactical scenarios training. Will buy again."
1,Adult signature?,"I was getting ready to put these in my cart when I read that an adult has to sign to receive them because they are human shaped. I'm supposed to take a day off work and wait for the UPS guy? Forget that - you just lost a customer. Its reactionary bowing to libtard nonsense that makes us weak, and I won't support this."
5,Fun Shirt - Right Price!,"With an Amazon credit card and the $13.00 coupon, a $2.00 for a long sleeve t-shirt is good stuff! With the amount of pictures on the site, you can see exactly what the front and back look like...including the fact that it does advertise the theater series."
4,Great gag gift!,"My dad loves Monty Python so he was pleased when he opened his gift to find this fanged rabbit. It is a bit small, but that is included in the products description. This is a great gift for Holy Grail fans!!"
2,Overpriced,"Cool item, but way overpriced for the size (2-3"") long. I expected more for the amount of money that I paid."
2,Mouth stays closed,"The rabbit toy that u will receive looks exactly like the above picture EXCEPT the mouth will be closed and stay closed unless u open it yourself. Also the teeth will b folded over and down and which ever way it feels. I wanted a rabbit looking like it was going to bite u, not a normal rabbit with big teeth."
4,Good stuff,"This bunny is true to the Monty Python movie. A white rabbit with big pointy teeth. Just realize before you buy this that it is small. Would look good on top of a TV or on a shelf, but if Junior is going to play with it it'll disappear."
3,Laden with corporo-speak - techies beware,"This is a good book if you're a member of a corporation planning a wireless network deployment; it spends a significant fraction of its time talking about the administrative structures that should be built up around a rollout.If you're a tech-head trying to learn more about the technology, prepare to wade through pages and pages of management jargon (complete with the same simplified diagrams you'd expect to see in a business seminar PowerPoint presentation.) This book will not help you much in constructing a home or community wireless network; it is oriented to project managers.If you're management, buy this book - but have your engineers buy something else."
1,Scanner is not fit for scanning slides or film. Poor Software. Too slow.,"I bought this scanner to digitise my old slides. The scanner however cannot do the job : the scanned slides are out of focus (even more with the slide adapter) and the colours are dreadfull (blacks). These cannot be corrected in Photoshop.The software is also not userfriendly (selection and deselection of frames, frame selection not corresponding with final scan, settings that change in between scan...). I used a cheap Afga scanner before that had much better scanning software...Scanning one slide with 4800 dpi resolution takes about half an hour...My advise : do not buy this high resolution scanner if you intend to use it for scanning slides and films..."
5,exceeded expectations,"I just purchased this scanner, and we had some operator foopaws, because being typical man, my husband was trying to just do it! with his previous scanner and electronic experience. He did work for HP as a tech. We got excellent detail on 14+ year old negatives. Our very old photo's came out crystal clear and detail was perfect. I wanted to use it for restoration and art. Just in the beginning testing it has met and exceeded all I wanted. To others users accept some responsibility in operator error!!!"
2,Who thought this one up:,"I am a steven seagal fan and have quite a few of his dvds, I also have a few of his collectibles. I was shocked when i opened this last one {4 film favorites, hard to kill, on deadly ground, exit wounds and out for justice.} I've never seen a collection packed in this manner, is this what we have to look forward to? The word for this packing is STACKABLE, yes I said STACKABLE, one on top of the other.Just trying to get the bottom one out is a feat. I would have liked to know how this was packaged, I don't think I would have purchased this one!"
3,ACTION MOVIE FAN,I have a collection of action movies and a number of them are Steven Seagal. The four in this collection made a nice addition to the list.
3,"loved it, until it stopped working","This was the perfect heating pad, probably my favorite one ever. I would have given it 5 stars, but it stopped working today. I just bought it in April. There's another reviewer who had the same experience, so I'm debating on whether to order another one. I think I'll try another brand."
5,My Favorite Heating Pad,"I use a heating pad every day for my back and this pad is the exact right size. The best thing about this pad is that it is a little rigid and doesn't bunch up in a ball behind my back. The pad heats up very fast and gets nice and hot. This is the second time I have bought this pad and probably will buy it again.Sunbeam Health at Home King Size Heating Pad with HeatSense Technology, Grey"
1,Low Quality,"Have had this heating pad for a month and a half... it has stopped working all together now...While it worked its high setting was hot but not that hot, ... honestly i miss those old ones your grandparents had... they worked.... Period these kinda work and then not for long."
1,bad item,this heat pad does not work.just about the time you get to getting relief it go's off. there is on way to get it to stay on.
2,"Over rated, short lived","I owned one of these things. Any heat higher than the lowest was too hot. It would turn off automatically and could not be made to stay on. So, in the middle of the night you wind up cold because it had turned off automatically. It finally died, after about two years of only occasional use. I would not buy one again. Look for one that stays on all night and for which the heat settings are more reasonable."
3,Made me hungry...,"I felt bad...because after reading this book about what a horrible, racist image Aunt Jemima is...I was inspired to go get a box of her mix and eat pancakes three meals a day. Very informative book, it goes a bit far in blaming everything in the world on racism...as is the style of the day"
1,Ray Charles: modern sounds in country and western,"Problem with many of these recordings is they don't tell you if its STEREO or MONO recordings.After purchasing many MONO recordings on Amazon, I no longer buy anything originally recorded prior to 1970. Remasted means nothing, but a good sales ploy.Some of the recordings at companies like Stax or Atlantic are MONO up until 1970. No wonder so many artist like Ray Charles moved on.Apparently Atlantic didn't know about STEREO recording until way late in the game.If you like a very flat sound, no problem."
1,The Warped Pan - Zero Stars,"After using your pan for 2 or 3 times, it now rotates on the counter if the handle is pushed. Worse than that however, this is the first time I used a pan coated in something, and whatever you sprayed on the pan cracked and flaked into my food!!!!! I ate some. What did I eat? I had another Calphalon set for at least 20 years, and should have never given it to the church. Your non - stick set is OK to boil water in. Can I return the warped/ flaked pan, and buy a higher quality pan that can withstand a high heat, and/ or a hot oven? Yes, I have the receipt, and do not want to return it for the same type. Instead of an exchange, can the price of the pan be applied to another of your higher quality pans that can withstand a 700 degree oven, and a high flame on a gas stove?Sincerely,Mr. Barry L. Serini"
4,Very good pan,"This is a great pan for the price. It is an excellent size to make an omlette for 2 people. I had a little trouble with the ceramic burners on my new stove in getting the temp right the first couple of times that I used it, however, once I had that figured out it works beautifully. The nonstick surface makes cleaning a breeze. The only thing you have to scrub are the little metal bolt caps that hold the handle to the pan. Eggs seem to like to stick to those. It is also a perfect pan for sauteing nearly anything. I would advise keeping the heat on the low end until you get the hang of this particular pan as it heats so well that I ended up overcooking or browning things too quickly. Overall it is a very nice pan and Amazon offered it at a very reasonable price. I would definitely recommend it."
5,Amazing...,This cd is my 3rd favorite Hanson cd! Kind of like a concert in your room! I would defiantly buy this! I would also go to a Hanson concert there so much fun!
1,Disgusting,"Everything we tried from this book was disgusting. I like to cook lowfat, vegetarian meals, but the few recipes in this book that even sounded appealing turned out to be nasty. I would recommend ""Everyday Cooking with Dr. Dean Ornish"" instead for those who want very lowfat recipes -- most items in there are easy and tasty."
1,While I might be interested in this book...,"I find it absurd that the Kindle version costs almost six dollars more than a NEW paperback version. When the publishers attempt to take advantage of consumers that are Green and environmentally conscious, I refuse to support or purchase their products."
5,"Good diet plan - not a ""diet""","I would first like to say that this isn't actually a ""diet."" It's a healthier way of living. Though I do think that 10 grams of fat should probably be upped to about 20. Also, to the person who said, ""my body needs the amino acids in animal proteins to function properly"" is rather uneducated - all the amino acids in proteins can be found in all plant sources. Protein deficiency, especially in the western world, is highly rare, even in the Vegan population. It's the *last* thing we need to worry about. At any rate, I am excited to try the other McDougal books as well."
5,Lives Up to Billing,"I have enjoyed using Dr. and Mrs. McDougall's cookbook. The recipes are easy and quick as described. Even though I have done next to no cooking previously, the recipes are easy to follow. You shouldn't be disappointed if you're looking for a guide to better health and tasty meals and snacks."
5,new vegetarian,"After watching the documentary ""Forks Over Knives"" we changed our eating habits. We needed to find recipes our whole family would enjoy and with young children (ages 7 and twins 5) would not take too long to prepare. The recipes are easy to follow and our kids have liked everything (so far!). There is a lot of great information and helpful tips as well. I wish there were pictures...but other than that, this was a great purchase! A+ :)"
1,Crap and junk !,"House of the dead was complete crap! This was the worst movie I had ever seen... in my life! Literaly! This had bad acting, and I have no clue how the director thought this was an actual movie. And scary? How stupid was this movie you ask?I'd give this a negative one hundred million out of 1. It made gigli look like an AWARD WINNER! I'm only a kid, but I could have made a better movie."
3,Yet another minority member...,"I know, I KNOW! No one likes this movie. People enjoy taking a big dump on it.And I know my reputation is at stake here, but I liked this movie. Did I love it as one of the best out there. Well, I won't go that far. The acting, plot, random daytime rave, and swordfight at the end were... well, in a word, not the greatest.But for me, the saving grace of the movie is the gun battle on and around the boat and the assault on the island cabin that houses the mystery. Or, the House of the Dead.Seriously, any real fan of zombie horror has dreamed of getting a stack of weapons and unloading on an army of zombies. This movie delivers that in spades! Zombies blasted from top to bottom, and tremendous exploding headshots! The movie has gore aplenty, as per any good zombie movie, and zombies getting blasted, just like the video game.I agree, not the greatest zombie movie, but I've seen much worse."
1,Aaarrghh!,"I made a mistake by renting this movie and an even bigger mistake by watching it. That the film is based on a video game I never heard of should have been a clue. I'm sure that it was the worst movie I ever saw.This movie has lines like ""We got to the boat but it wasn't there."" and ""This book, it's pretty old. Maybe it'll help us."" When the kids have the chance to get of the island on a boat they are to scared because their might be a couple of zombies on the boat. Instead they choose to trap themselves in an old house, of which they know nothing, and fight off hundreds of zombies on their way to it.Is the movie really that bad? No, it's even worse."
1,What is everyone scared of?,"I'm not going to mention how bad the acting was, everyone else did that for me, but geesh! Aside from everything else mentioned in previous reviews, one thing I found annoying was how everyone was concerned for their safety. However, whenever there was an encounter with the zombies, they either turned into the Karate Kid or Rambo and made quick work of the zombies. I thought to myself, what are the afraid of? Also, the fight scene to get into the house lasted forever, of course everything takes longer in bullet time."
3,"""House of the Discharge""","There's a rave on an island which is called ""The Island of the Dead."" Of course you have the usual group of imbecilic, young adults who want to attend this rave. Upon arrival, no one is to be found and the party is over. Oh, poor kids. Then these zombies jump out from the trees and form buffet lines. ""House of the Dead"" is so dumb, it works. As an ode to 'B' movies and really cheesy awful horror movies, the action never lets up and the zombies even know martial arts. It's incredibly funny during the shootout in the cemetery. And they even threw in an immortal zombie who's looking for pretty body parts to add to his collection. Man, that artifact can move like Hammer! There's plenty of action, there's plenty of nudity for all you teenage boys, and there's plenty of quick shots ripped straight from the video game! Oh yes, Sega would be proud. DO NOT take this movie seriously because it doesn't take itself seriously."
1,DONT DO IT!!!,Lets see there are so many things I can say about this movie but I think only one word will sum it all up.......SUCKED..........
2,Poor and tired thriller.,"Monday, February 21, 2005 / 2 of 5 / Poor and tired thriller.Lacking some of the visceral thrill of 28 Days Later or the remake of Dawn of the Dead this film goes through its paces as a inoffensive time waster. A group of not really attractive [strike one] kids show up late for a rave on a remote San Juan Island near Seattle. Hooking up w/ rug head from the Wraith and Juergen P. from Das Boot they sail off to their doom, only partially postponed by the older sister from Halloween 4-5. Undead zombies attack and the rest is predictable Night of the Living Dead reprises. Interspersed are quick shots of the video game this is based on. This was nothing special, even Resident Evil was better than this."
3,"Holy crap, this movie is terrible","I've seen some bad movies in my time, but man this one really takes the cake. I can't believe this garbage was put in theatres. The acting is hilarious. I love how there are zombies all over, and one guys girlfriend even turns into one and attacks him, then gets shot repeatedly. The boyfriend just kinda shrugs it off. No emotion at all. NOTHINGAlthough my favorite part ever that me and my friend are now quoting non stop is the heartfelt scene where Curien is crying about how some lady died, he says (and i quote)She's dead, i didn't save her.. IT WAS MY FAULT... Were you here? did you see it? Did you see watch them rip her apart?SEE WATCH them rip her apart. I had to rewind to make sure i wasn't hearing things, then i put on the subtitles. Was that REALLY their best take? Man this movie is horrible and that's what makes it great. One of those corny ass flicks you can watch just to laugh at."
1,"Why God, Why","There has never been, and there never will be, a movie worse than house of the dead. You may think I'm exaggerating, but sadly I'm not. In the middle of random scenes it plays clips from the video game. In one scene, me and my friends counted 5 zombie extras wandering around in the background with no makeup and no costumes on. One extra was even wearing a pink and white bucket hat. Thats just a little bit obvious. It would appear that halfway through filming, they simply stopped trying. Any movie based on a game is destined for failure, and this movie is clear evidence of that."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,Don't waste your time on this mess. Worst movie I've ever seen...and I've seen ALOT of movies. I despise having to give it a star because NO STARS was not an option.
2,What is this?,"What is this? I don't even know.Do you think they know? I doubt it.I don't even know what this is. I think one of the zombies even had wings. It was probably a zombie angel.Video game clips, what's that about? Is it a movie or an advertisement? Beats me.Does anyone know what this is? If you do, please write and let me know. I don't know, that's for sure!"
3,Not bad and almost enjoyable,"This movie has gotten the worst reviews I have ever seen, but when I saw it, I expected it to be way worse. The begginng is not the best but it begins to pick up after the first half housr. I like the explanation of how the zombie's lived. The video game references were cool too. The writing I will say was awful but besides that everything is decent. It isn't the best movie I have ever seen, but enjoyable none the less. Maybe it is so bad it is fun to watch. I sometimes like movies like that, but all in all it isn't as bad as people say. The movie has it's high and low points. It was also nice to see Ellie Cornell(Halloween 4, 5) in another movie."
1,The Funniest Movie I've Ever Seen,"This movie is so terribly bad, so horribly done, that to not see it is a travesty in itself. I paid 75 cents to see it in the theatre and laughed the entire time.This is the perfect movie to rent and watch with a bunch of friends while drinking cases of beer, it's so hilariously bad, it's genuis."
1,It's that bad,"Can't anyone make a good zombie movie outside of the 'Dead' movies? Even some of them are pretty lame. Aside from over endulgence in gore let's talk acting here. Now I know that in these types of movie acting shouldn't matter, but here it is plain bad. Stilted actors and lame dialog.I usually like a Dead movie, been a fan ever since as a boy it took me 7 tries before I finally made it all the way through the origianl 'Night of the LIving Dead' (which in my opinion is the best of any). But this one was bad.No sense of logic, the heroes extracate themselves from a 'hopeless' situation near the end oh so easily, and don't get me started on the ending fight sequence. I did like the way she popped the leader's head like a pimple however. Thought that was fun.Just another in a long line of poorly done movies that should be reserved for Sat afternoon on the SciFi Channel."
1,I wish....,"I wish that they had shot me in the head instead of the zombies! This movie has proven what I thought would be impossible by sucking and blowing at the same time. I would not have given this movie a 1 star but that is as low as it goes. From the cheesy looking zombies to the wanna be Matrix effects, I would not even let my worst enemy watch this. This is right down there with Dude, Where's My Car? You actually start wanting these dumbasses to be killed off in a manner just as slow and as horrible as having to sit through this movie. Then leave a tease like there will be a sequel. If there is even an attempt to make a sequel then they need to round every one of the people associated with it and ritually kill them all. Do yourself a favor and never speak of this movie and don't even think of buying it. I would not have it even if someone paid me to take it."
1,What an insult to a great Video Game,"What a terrible insult to a great video game.There is nothing to say about this ""would be"" Zombie movie based on the video game by the same name except..... Everything Was Don Badly In This Film !!!!!SEGA should sue for defamation of character over the way they insulted a great video game."
3,To Small to Enjoy...,Ordered this book and was surprised by the size when it arrived. It is slightly bigger than a CD. It is a book about art but the pictures are small and the print even smaller. Very disappointed. Great subject but too small to enjoy.
3,not too young and stylish,I guess its ok but nothing spectacular. That being said I'm under 35 and this cologne it seems tends to suit older men.One my high school students told me I smelt like her Dad ...
4,sunglasses,"The product is fine, but I was not able to get it through Amazon. I received conflicting reports concerning the order. The vendor sent me a message saying they were out of the product, and Amazon sent a message saying the item had been shipped. It had not been shipped. I ended up buying the sunglasses at the local mall."
4,Great for petite faces,"I am very petite and have previously purchased Ray Ban kids' sunglasses, but after reading some of the reviews I decided to give these a try. They are a tiny bit loose on my face but generally fit well and look great. Compared to my last pair of sunglasses they seem delicate but I'm sure I'll get over that as time goes on, especially knowing that Ray Ban products have always been reliable."
1,Do not buy anything here,"Do not buy them ! Description is confusing these sunglasses are actually for kids they are xtremetly small , NOT FOR ADULTS ! If you are not sure about the size look for them somewhere else , i had to return them and i had to pay for the shipping 10$ and they also charge you a restocking fee 20$ so i lost my money i lost 30$ given away to these people, really bad business really bad policy , DO NOT BUY ANYTHING HERE ! They will get your money !"
1,"lens popped out, seller doesn't respond to emails!!!","I had a lens pop out soon after purchasing, while walking, and crack on the floor.Seller stopped returning emails when I started to ask about warranty. I just want to get this fixed, bad customer service...."
1,disappointed!,"These where junior glasses. Unfortunately i live abroad, so i didnt have time to return them! I have to give them to my 10 year old son! i am very disappointed!"
3,ray ban aviators,"the sunglasses are great and look damn good. however, they are not really the best at keeping out sun. they do block the actual rays that hit the glasses, but b/c of the shape of these classic glasses (not wraparound) they dont keep out all rays and so unless you're going for ""the look"" (which i was) they are not the best sunglasses."
5,Easy to deal with!,"I ordered these glasses the week before Christmas and got them within days. They came in mint condition, good as new!"
4,Just the right size,"I ordered these glasses for my 18 year old daughter. She has a small face and they were just the right size. The regular aviators were just too large. The case is small enough to fit in a small purse, not big and bulky like the way-farer case. Love these glasses."
4,perfect fit,"I didnt read the reviews about the sunglasses until I had already purchased them. They were a perfect fit for me. I'm 5'8 and slim, with a narrow face and I wouldn't need anything bigger than these. The handles fit to my ears and the frame is not at all tight on my face.These shades may look small for most people, but I'd say they're not for folks with wider faces."
3,I made a mistake,I made a mistake because the sunglasses are so small for me. I don't know tha One Size is a small size. This is for a kid.
5,Ray Ban sunglasses,"I received my sunglasses timely, in perfect conditions, and it was exactly what I was expecting. I am very pleased with the service. Thanks"
4,"Six-star music, docked for outdated restoration","In addition to being among the most influential and beautiful jazz sides ever recorded, the original Okeh 78s were exceptionally well-recorded for their day, as any collector lucky enough to own one will tell you. Digital remastering was in its early days when Columbia issued this and its companion Bix disc, and it shows; the sound is flat, with the brilliance of the highs all but gone. It's shameful that Sony/BMG, which now owns nearly EVERYTHING Bix recorded, including the Columbia and Victor Whiteman sides, has not done justice to Bix by releasing the beautiful boxed set that collectors worldwide would welcome. In the meantime, the best restorations thus far are the ""Bix Restored"" sets, and that's where you should begin if you have interest in Bix or the best of late 20s jazz in general."
1,Beware of this book,If you are looking for a book that will help you understand Visual Lisp - this is NOT it. Page after page of screen shots with a line or two of unhelpful text - you would be much better off just using AutoCAD help. Maybe the next book on VL will do more than scratch the surface.
5,Wonderful!,"Bob James consistantly releases great CD's, but this one is truly a masterpiece. I have enjoyed his music for many years and this new album adds a new dimension to his work. I am particularly impressed by the numbers with Joe Sample."
4,"Pushing the ""cozy"" envelope","Not as light as typical cozy. You don't often get teared up in a cozy and this one can bring a tear to your eye. Some of the elements return from the first book such as the ex-husband Matteo shaking things up and her wonderful employee Tucker making you chuckle. But this book goes into the dark side of a psychopath a little bit more. I was saddened by the climax, which also made this cozy push the typical rules. I think there is room at the table for this book with its touches of reality flavoring the brew rather than strictly glossing over the harasher sides of murder."
1,Same Author?,"I read the first book in this series ""On What Grounds"" which was wonderful fun, filled with interesting characters and great coffee tips,BUT! This second one""Through the Grinder"" was a big disappointment. Writing style was different,main characters acted differently,and unbelievably,and there were some disgusting things, one especially indescribable, and a terrible ending! Couldn't believe it was by the same author! I had praised the first book to my 80 year old aunt who loves good mysteries(and coffee) but now am warning her about this second one. Perhaps the author had a deadline problem!"
2,sad and pointless,"I grabbed up this book - in the mood for a cozy - and was a bit shocked by the tragic ending. I had the murderer down right away - I think I saw a movie with a similar plot, but why the tragic ending? In reading a cozy I don't expect such things and I have to say I was disappointed. The book reads quickly - and has the cozy atmostphere throughout. I don't like this woman's relationship with her ex - Move on, have some respect for yourself! She seems bound to be with someone with baggage or someone who can't fully invest in a commitment. Anyway - I don't think I'll bother reading the next one. Too bad - because the scene - a NYC Greenwich Village coffee house is the perfect set up for the series."
3,Entertaining,"Joe, Hickey and Cheryl are kidnappers. They abduct children, ask for a moderate ransom in the form of a wire so that the transaction runs smoothly and is completed within 24 hours.As they are about to kidnap Abby, Will and Karen Jennings's daughter, they can hardly imagine that this time their operation is going to be anything but easy-going. As for the victims, they are about to spend the worst 24 hours in their lives."
5,The speed of light,This is one you better be ready to read non stop. A master thesis in kidnapping and terror. He touches every nerve in your system and scorches them. All the characters were well researched and were strongly believable. I would highly recommend this Author and will read all his other writings.
1,LIKE WATCHING A TV MOVIE,"This book is one long commercial from beginning to end. It plugs more than 65 products, many of them several times. People in this book don't drive a car or watch TV; they drive ""the Expedition"" and watch ""the Hitachi."" Even advertising executives don't talk like this. So pervasive is this advertising that the reader is actually shocked when someone prepares iced tea rather than iced Lipton. With all the books available here, there's no point in wasting money on this slap in the face to the reader."
1,Islam - Religion of Intolerance and Genocide,"I heartily encourage all students of religion to read the Quran and Hadith, that they might see themselves the message of intolerance and hate put forth by Mohammed. ""Do not make friends with the Jew or the Christian."" -- Quran. ""The End will not come until the Muslims kill all Jews."" -- Hadith. By all means, learn the truth, and read Mohammed's words, that you might learn the truth about Islam."
4,Just looks better...where's the DL version?,"I have been using the matte white verbatims for a long time and have been very satisfied. However, these glossy surface dvds just look better than the matte. Recording is the same as far as I can tell...excellent results. I just wish Verbatim made dual layer glossy printables."
5,Great book,I love how Paul Brand writes. I have bought many copies to give away over the years. Comparing the lepers lack of pain and the gift that pain is has helped me over the years as I deal with my constant pain helps me. His ideas stay in my mind! A must read!
4,nice plate,"Like the other reviewer stated, it is made of a very thin metal, bends very easy. It does looks nice, even though I have a Liberty and not a Wrangler."
5,Great Idea!!,"I saw this being use on a web site video and thought that it would work out nicely on my 13"" snare drum. I was wrong it worked out GREAT! and gave the cross sticking even more volume than expected while keeping a worm sound at the same time. This was worth the price."
2,Good ideas but bad approach!,"The ideas on this book are really good and valid, but the way the writer approaches and defends his ideas is not professional and is somewhat offensive. Again, really good ideas, but really bad approach to solutions."
2,Not as good as the others,"Generally, I like Orbit gum. I think a number of their flavors are fantastic. But I'm not as fond of the Citrus Mint. When citrus and mint get together it tastes a bit too much like a dentist's office for my taste. This gum tastes like the paste they use to polish teeth at the dentist's office, and that's just not what I'm looking for in a chewing gum. I'll be sticking with sangria and melon mint."
3,Disappointing,"The idea that an alien civilization would kidnap kids to fight their wars is an intriguing one; sort of ""Peter Pan"" meets ""All Quiet on the Western Front."" Unfortunately, this is yet another New Adventure that spends too much time on character and not enough on plot. In addition, the Doctor is absent for most of the book, and we're left with Roz dealing with racism in 1920's France (which I thought was a tad unrealistic; France was much more liberal about race than most countries at that time)."
2,"This Book is about Rafe, Not about Studetns","As I new educator, I was looking for a book that gave me some insights into Rafe's success. Instead I found a book about the man, not about children. I found this book to be a self-serving commercial with little or no help for beginning educators."
3,Very Easy Reader,"If one approaches this book as realistic fiction, it is a quick, easy read. Unfortunately, the author's hubris, which remains apparent despite several transparent passes made at appearing humble, makes it difficult to take this book seriously as a non-fiction work.The author's anecdotes consistently fall into the good-guy (the author) vs. bad-guy (anyone who dares to annoy or disagree with the author) scenario. Although breezily paced, the book is riddled with simplistic thinking and painfully awkward writing, resulting in a three-star effort at best."
2,Self-Serving and Not Practical,"Esquith is a little too much like Harry Wong. He assumes everything will fall into place when you get your assignment. He also disparages mandatory curriculums which are assigned to teachers. But he doesn't take into account the following:1. The students schedules can be changed constantly, so they're never in the same class for more than two weeks.2. The kids may come to class too angry to learn.3. Politics may be more important than the kids' education.There are many other factors that keep teachers from providing the very best. Luckily for Mr. Esquith, everything fell into place for him. But we can't all rely on luck."
2,The only scary thing was that I finished it.,"Personal experiences received some validation in this story. There were plausible explanations of paranormal activity, although she spent way too much time incessently droning on about how she would remain unbiased. Ramsland never seemed to concretely investigate an allegedly dead murderer, and was content to ""play"" in an insidious world. (Unbelievably stoic and cavalier.) Expecting the conclusion to wrap uploose ends, she instead wimped out and left it to the reader to decide, discrediting many of her ""findings."" I looked for missing pages...the ending was that lame."
2,too much rambling....,"When I started the book, I was really interested. I wanted to know what was up with the ring and the story behind it. But the author kept running off in different directions. Which became tedious and I found myself skipping pages to get to the meat of the story. Unfortunately it never was resolved. Why didn't the author inform the police??? And what happened to the missing reporter???? The whole book builds you up to one very anti-climactic end."
3,somewhat interesting / somewhat redundant,"I found some parts interesting, and some parts redundant. Too much about orbs, and too much about Wraith & Christian. I glimpsed through some parts, but found some parts interesting to read, especially Ms. Ramsland's visits to well established haunts across the country. However, she's always preoccupied with the ring, Wraith and Christian, and those parts concerning those visits would have been of more interest left alone and seperate from her personal search for Christian. The parts on EVP, a new technique in recording the voices of disembodied entities, was very interesting, and I'd like to get a hold of one of those devices."
4,You'll Need to Believe In Order to Appreciate this Book,I love Ramsland's books because she goes way out there and I mean out there to get a story (not to mention taking a lot of dangerous chances! From vampires she now turns to the supernatural culture though a character from her previous vampire book is a major part of her spiritual journey! Ramsland takes us to haunted places and encounters psychics and ghost hunters along the way. Always wanting to believe in ghosts and never actually seeing one prior to this book Ramsland uses various ghost hunting cameras and equipment and tape recorders to contact the other side. I found her account fascinating and earnest. You will too if you are inclined towards believing yourself. I for one am one of those who beleive we are not alone and there are certain unexplained phenomena.
1,Too bored to finish reading this book,"In between bits of history, Dr. Ramsland fusses over her recorders and cameras and meters in great detail. She may or may not have stolen the ghost of a dead serial killer. We never find out (I did sneak ahead and read the last couple of pages before tossing this book to the side) if Christian was a ghost or even a real person at one time. Certainly with all of the money poured into equipment, travel, and research that went into the writing of this book, there was a little time to get the actual biography on who this not-quite-ghost was.It was a real chore to read what I did of this book with all of the blithering about orbs and dust. Don't let the back copy trick you into thinking you've picked up a spooky gem."
1,Same as DOTN but worse...,"Its been a while since i wrote a review but as the new Days Of The New disc comming out (red), i just want to say that this album is a copy of DOTN, and after hearing this cd you will know why Travis Meeks fired them, better buy DOTN red and green"
2,The same old song,"I'll say it again, too soft for my taste. I don't like this kind of music too much. 2 stars because it ain't THAT bad, it just ain't THAT good either... Yep."
3,Dont have a Tantric attack...jeezzz,I think this CD is just ok and has a few good songs on it but thats it. I personally like the first Days of the New album better than this if you compare the songwriting...I know that the lead singer dumped the band(kind of like A-hole Rose of Guns n' Roses did...p.s. Slash is badazzz)and they went on and formed Tantric with a new singer of their own. Will find in the bargain bin at any music store even here at Amazon.
5,awsome this cd is awsome,"id never herd tantric or of them but the cd looked cool so i got it. Man am i glad i bought it i love every song on it , from the haunting Mourning the wonderfull Breakdown or the cryptic Revolution it sounds like AIC Jar Of Flys which is awsome cuz alice is my fav group this cd you will love i bought it in may and its stayed in my player ever since i hope they make a folow up soon:)"
5,Former Days of the New,"Travis Meeks is missing out.His former band is really rising up the charts.Days of the New is good too,but Tantric has a better chance than Travis' one man band.You will probably hear ""Breakdown"" on the radio,but check out the whole album. You'll be impressed."
2,Tantric Live,"I had the privilage of seeing Tantric open for Dust for Life who consequently cancelled due to bands illness. Tantric was who I wanted to see anyway. They played the Hurricane in KC to a small Tuesday night crowd. Met Hugo after the show and he was a nice guy. It was a treat. ($5 cover) I have to admit the rest of the songs (off air) grow on you quick. It would be great to see these guys break away. I definately recommend to buy it. Especially Creed,Chains,Full Devil Jacket fans. This would be the one to pull out on a road trip and have it play a few times through."
1,I agree!!!,"I have to say that Casandra is FAR from being an artist full of charisma! On one occasion I saw her at a restaurant in San Bernardino and went up to her to congratulate her on her CD. She was so arrogant and totally blew me off! Now when she is onstage all she does is sing. She never really has any contact with the audience. I'm not saying she is a bad singer, but she is definitely NOT the best. I wouldn't even DARE compare her to Nydia Rojas... come on, Nydia sang with Juan Gabriel!!! That should tell you where they both stand!! I wish I could get my money back!!!!!"
3,Sinbad is much funnier than he comes off on this tape.,"I'm a big fan of Sinbad, so when I got this audiobook, I was really looking forward to listening to it on my next business trip. Having finished it, I can't say I was ENTIRELY disappointed, but it didn't live up to my expectations either.Unfortunately, it sounded too much like Sinbad reading rather that Sinbad talking. And that took away some of his charm. I have heard some of the chapters in the book from his concert performances, and he definitely delivered this stuff better when he was doing his live show. He just didn't seem to have the same energy as when he's in front of a live audience.Now, don't get me wrong...the book is still clever and funny, and I did enjoy the anecdotes that he delivered, but Sinbad is a comic that is best experienced in front of an audience."
3,A novel on the subject of teenage marriage,"I bought this book at a library book sale. I didn't have high expectations after reading the description inside the book jacket, but I thought I'd give it a go.I kept reading, because it was well-written and kept my interest, but it was a tad glum. Not one of those books that you just love and read over and over again.A 17-year old girl named April moves to a new town with her intellectual family and becomes involved with a young man who is a caretaker for an estate during his college break.They decide to get married but to keep it a secret, since the high school does not allow married students to attend. After they get found out, April gets kicked out of high school and discovers that her youthful marriage isn't all she thought it was going to be."
4,Great addition to my genealogy library,"Christine Rose was a contributor to ""Genealogy for Dummies"" which I also own. Plan to visit some courthouses on my next trip to PA, this book will be very helpful."
1,I am an adult who was adopted as a child.,"In the begining of the book the author states ""...adopted people who do not acknowledge their original mothers are not living authentically..."" I take exception to this statement. The person who gave birth to me IS NOT my mother. My mother is the person who guided me and loved me throughout my life. I have never had any urge to search for my ""original"" mother and I have several adopted friends who feel the same way. I do not deny the existance of the woman who gave birth to me, but I do deny that she has had ANY impact (other than DNA) on my life and who I am today.This book just perpetuates the myth that adopted children feel they are ""missing"" something (in this case the woman who gave birth to them.)"
1,"Sucks, missing best song.","I bought the album after hearing that hot new jam 'Rollin in the VIP' in the Nationwide Insurance commercial, then found it IT'S NOT EVEN ON THE ALBUM!!!! I guess it will be on the next album?"
2,"Great pictures, poor text","The photographs in the book are stunning, but the choice of such an antiquated and unscholarly text, particularly from a Thoreau scholar and President of the Thoreau Society, is abominable. Too bad the book is devalued by such a poor choice of text."
5,Crop in style xxl,The price I got this item for was excellent. It is very nice a roomy and all of my scrapbook supplies fit and has room to spare. If you are looking to get organized this is a great investment.I really do like the crop in style products.
4,Nice addition to a knitters library,"This was a good book, not quite as good as the first two of her stitch dictionaries though. Nice lace and cable stitches, but I could do without the mosaic patterns - the hand made charts, although understandable, look sloppy and detract from the book in my opinion."
2,Cheap Construction (Not a Review of Content),I bought these for my wife and returned them all. The books have a very cheap binding. I have had text books with sturdier construction fall apart within a semester. I doubt these would withstand regular use. I would recommend having them rebound except the margins are a bid narrow and the paper probably would not withstand much use in a spiral binding. It is really a shame that more effort wasn't put into the materials.
5,The best knitting book I own,Barbara Walker is amazing and her book has been an endless source of inspiration. Anyone interested in designing their own patterns will love this book.
5,"A Real ""Treasure""","Not as varied and useful as the first two books, but still a must have as there are a million different ways to use the patterns here. There is a lot more colorwork in this book than the previous ones."
2,Odd Cables,Barbara Walker is one of the masters of the knitting world. I have the 2nd Treasury and Mosaic Knitting. Both are excellent. This 3rd Treasury hs odd kinds of cables - the kind that I couldn't think how to use. The other patterns seemed to be a mish mash. I was disappointed and returned the book..
1,CD burning software ripoff or worse,Product writes CDs unintuitively and poorly - hard to write to multisession discs. Cannot uninstall. Not thru control panel 'remove programs'. There in no 'uninstall module'. There is no 'uninstall' in 'help' files. Nothing on Cosmi web site FAQ. Reviews of different Cosmi products in Amazon.com speculate about Cosmi associations with adware. Would not buy Cosmi products again
4,Winter Blues Victory,I was interested in getting a moderately in depth look into the Battle of Stones River. This book fulfilled my requirement. It was relatively short by comparison to some books focused on CW battles. It gave me as much as I cared or needed to know in 230 pages.
3,No child's play,"Everyday hustling starts @ a young age.The movie is shocking,giving a new meaning of life in the streets."
3,Lacked Something,"I rented this movie at the video store because nothing else looked good. Well this movie had more ups and downs than any movie I have watched in recent history. I imagine the book must be better.Acting: Some actors performed brilliantly. Others were shockingly bad!Filming: Some scenes were shot brilliantly. Other scenes were shockingly bad!And so would go the rest of my review were I to continue.To make a long review short. Do what I did, if you don't have anything else to watch, buy, or rent, check this movie out. Otherwise, look elsewhere for your entertainment. And one more thing: If you don't like watching young boys spewing foul language every few seconds - I also suggest you pass on this flick.G.B.www.therunninggirl.com"
4,Pretty good foot cream,This foot cream actually did leave my feet feeling softer and less scaly. Most foot creams and balms are sticky and greasy but this one was refreshing and absorbed quickly and left me feeling super moisturized and revived. Its cooling effect is amazingly relaxing after a long day too!
2,Just okay for me,"I like cellfood brand and was excited to try the multivitamins but I have to say that I am a tad bit disappointed by it. first of all it is not a complete multi and secondly the spray bottle is a little annoying because it is not a continuos spray, i had to pump it a lot just to get 6 complete sprays in. for the price paid i was not impressed, I will be going back to just the original cellfood and opting for a more complete multi so I feel like i am getting more value."
4,Interesting and Informative,"This Margaret Mitchell biography is very good. Ms. Edwards knows her subject and manages to supply the reader with interesting details, both on Margaret Mitchell herself and on the writing of her only novel as well as the making of the film and Ms. Mitchell's involvement in that project.The book is easily read and written in a very entertaining and descriptive style, making the reader feel as if he or she were really there.An excellent place to begin a study of the enigma that was Margaret Mitchell."
4,A New Terror Fabulous,"""Everyone Falls In Love"" (title cut) is a new dancehall hit,, D.J. Camilo fans have already heard the music to this song dubbed with Buju Banton and Sean Paul which played superbly into the real lyrics of this song. A new smooth movving dancehall song!!"
2,A must addition to your Blackploitation Movie Collection,"This movie is no academy award winner, but it's a fun movie to watch. The dialogue is laughable."
5,Love this movie.,"I remeber watching this when I was a kid. A guy at work asked me to order this online for him. I decided to order if for me instead and loved it. Great film with some suprising good acting by everybody. The director had a small budget,but looks like he had a much bigger one. Great film and my favorite prision film ever. To bad part 2 sucked."
4,One of the best movies ever,I loved this movie. The plot was good enough to make up for the fact that the dialogue was campy and goofy at times and the acting was sub-par. It's worth a watch. A true classic.
1,Beware of ruining Christmas,"I have this stand, same model number but different manufacturer (They must have taken the other company over). A week after I put up my tree, while no one was near it, it fell down. The problem-the plastic in the tree recepticle by the screws that hold the tree cracked!. Down went the tree, ornaments and all."
1,Where is the chargaer? and this is wrong product.,I ordered #74001 but I got ST74000.It is not my order.Also there is no charger with the product.This is rechargeable flash light.It is nonsense without special charger for that.I already emailed twice to the contact info which amazon gave me to check my order.2 weeks passed but no answer.I will try to write 3rd email from now.who can help me?
4,My kind of investigators,"I watched this series when it was on tv, I loved it then and I love it now, I could watch Joe Penny everyday. He was hot!!! And they always get their guy or girl."
2,Poorly Constructed Arms,"These arms did NOT fit the ""Tiffany Office Furniture 4005AG2110 Adjustable Swivel Task Stool."" Three pilot holes drilled into the bottom of the seat did not align with the arms' screw holes. The arms only move up and down; they don't move in and out."
3,Not up to Blake's standards.,"Heiress Victoria Molina-Vandergraff escaped from her kidnappers only to be shot by the local sheriff hot on their trail for robbery. Sheriff Roan Benedict is suspicious of his prisoner's story, but Tory's claim of amnesia keeps him guessing. Tory is afraid her former fiance is behind the kidnapping and doesn't think her stepfather will believe her. Continued danger from her kidnappers combines with a growing attraction to Roan and life in Turn-Coupe.A good story, but not up to Blake's prior Turn-Coupe books. Tory caused most of her own problems, but her reasons are understandable -- at first. Then it becomes ridiculous. Blake should make her next Turn-Coupe heroine honest and forthright."
2,Romantic suspense,I enjoyed this book for the most part. I felt as though you really didn't get to know the main characters that well partially because the did not know themselves. They did some odd things in the story such as the sheriff of this small town suddenly getting a sophisticated electronic ankle monitor for someone who has not even been charged with a crime. No one calls him out on his moral obligation to this woman he has shot and then convicted without any reasonable explanation. I did not find either of the main characters very likable and it was only the suspense of the story line that kept me reading it to the end.As a dog lover I was also bothered by him keeping his prized hounds out in the Louisiana heat of summer.
1,not what i ordered,"well, i suppose this carafe is adequate, it does keep coffee hot ... but the picture i clicked on when ordering was a metallic finish and i received white ... so if in doubt don't order or go to a retail store so you get what you want"
2,Just entertainment,"Being a soldier in Iraq and learning Japanese, this set was just ok. I wouldn't pay more than $9 or $10 for the set. Acting was no better than a highschool drama. Special effect we not even subpar."
3,=0),"It wasn't as great as I thought it would be...I guess I expected too much. =0) The first couple chapters are slow, but I admit, it does get better towards the middle. Overall, it was a good read."
4,It has the essentials...,"Laugh, Laugh, and Just A Little. There's some on here that are sophomoric, some are worth a spin, but the afore mentioned are reason enough to buy this CD, and give it 4 stars."
1,"simplistic, factually inaccurate","I have read and enjoyed numerous dummies books (Investing, Personal Finance, Mutual Funds, etc.) This book was a dud. Poorly organized, simplistic and numerous factual inaccuracies."
4,Great Start,"I bought this book before I started jumping into stock investing. It's a great beginner's resource that will get you up to speed on a variety of topics / strategies / ideas. If you want to start investing in the stock market, best get your hands on a copy. It's not going to teach you the details of everything you need to know, but it will get you started and point you in the right direction for research, financial data, etc. After you have a good foundation, you can move on to more advanced books."
2,very disappointed,"Though I would at least be able to start investing after reading this book.Not so, you could learn everything in this book online for free at yahoo finance.The book teaches you how to do fundamental analysis, and no technical analysis whatsoever.do yourself a favor and don't buy this book"
5,A must-have for the shoe stretcher,Makes it simple to stretch your shoes in the right places for that custom fit.
4,A Surprising Pleasure,"After reading many of the reviews I bought this CD and have played it several times. Although I agree with some of the reviews my favorites are: Tom Jones, Boyzone, Elaine Paige,The Everly Brothers, Sound of Blackness and Boy George. I did not at all like Meatloaf's rendition and always skip it when I listen to the CD, but that's my personal taste. And, Tina Arena's song is all right but very lackluster. All in all, if you want to hear a very good score I would recommend you take a chance on this one."
1,Absolute insanity,"This book is a rehash of several books published in France--I say again, FRANCE--which desperately seek to attack anything BUSH rather the true enemies of our country: Islamic fascists. This man may have some credibility with the UFO abduction crowd, but that's it.Such ""theories"" can only harm our attempts to defend ourselves. I'm sure that in translation this would be a big seller among al Qaeda members."
5,A landmark book,"It is some years since I read 'The New Pearl Harbor' and, though much new evidence has come to light since, it is probably still the best introduction. Indeed, the evidence against the official conspiracy theory is now so mountainous that a basic introduction such as 'The New Pearl Harbor' provides a very useful first step in beginning to climb this mountain.Griffin's brilliant dismemberment of the official explanation for the horrors of 9/11, coupled with his doggedness and courage, will surely mark him as one of the great American citizens -- in contrast to the ruling cabal whose deeply contorted values have dragged America's name into the sewers of history."
